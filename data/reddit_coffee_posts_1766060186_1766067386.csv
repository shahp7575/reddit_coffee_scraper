1pprsyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeginnerKorean/comments/1pprsyc/the_comfortable_korean_learning_plan_and_app_i/,The comfortable Korean learning plan (and app) I wish I had at TOPIK 3,"I’ve been seeing a lot of posts from people hitting the vocab wall or coming back after a break feeling Korean is difficult again. I personally started to self study Korean when I was 8, and had stuck on TOPIK 3 for 8+ years. I know if there’s no actual URGENCY/NEED, we don’t go too far nor want to break any wall. 



Here is what I think that help to channel your motivation without setting any goal like TOPIK 6 passed to burn yourself out.



 **1. Returning but do not restart from zero.**

If you paused for months, don't go back to the basic. It’s boring and kills motivation. Instead, do

1. review survival chunks only (greetings, question to find the way etc.)

2. add chunks relevant to your actual life (ordering coffee, commuting)



Goal: Rebuild the habit of using the language



 **2. Stop memorizing isolated lists**

Single words don't teach you how Korean actually works. You learn the word, but can't make a sentence.



Don't: learn 친구 (friend) and 만나다 (to meet) separately

Do: learn 친구를 만나다 (to meet a friend) directly as a full phrase



This teaches the noun, the verb, and the object particle (-를) simultaneously. It feels slower, but your retention will double.



 **3. The ""Rules” Panic**

Beginners often feel that pronunciation or spelling rules are inconsistent. Usually, it’s just that you are seeing a pattern before your brain has enough data to recognize it.



What I Did: Reduce scope. Pick one grammar pattern and make 10 sentences with it.

What I Did Not Do: Don't ask why (yes don’t), just get used to the ""how"" through repetition. You will know why when you get there.



 **4. Why you should skip Romanization**

It is a crutch that prevents Hangul from ever clicking.



Sorry but Hangul reading speed comes from struggle and retrieval.

Rely on audio when you get stuck, not Latin letters. Train your ear, not your eyes.



**5. App Recommendation: Capwords (disclosure)**

If context-less flashcards don’t stick for you, I’ll recommend Capwords to keep vocab learning active by tying new words to things you actually see and do. (learn in the real world)



**Core functionality:** You scan an object (or record a short clip of an action), and the app recognizes what it is and generates corresponding Korean vocabulary with example sentences so you learn in context rather than as isolated words.



It also includes native speaking voice of 10+ options and spaced-repetition review.



Another thing that makes it special - it automatically crop the objects out from the pictures, and turn them into stickers.



**Note:** It intentionally does not support romanization to help Hangul reading fluency click faster & also keep the interface neat and tidy.



**Learning Structure:** Scan real-life objects - get vocab + example sentences - review later with SRS.



**Privacy:** Capwords processes everything locally and never uploads users’ images because it does not have a server.



**Format:** Mobile app on iOS.



**Pricing:** Free tier (daily limits) / 3-day full access trial/ Premium $9.99/month (unlimited saves + tracking).



You don’t need to be aiming at TOPIK 6 to be making real progress. 

Keep it small & consistent, and let the language become familiar through everyday contact. Even 10 minutes a day adds up faster than people expect.

Names changed for privacy. 

I (F30) and my coworker (Luca, M37) have been friends for a few years. It started with just talking at work over common interest, but now we’re the person the other comes to with life/personal problems and relationship issues (both married with kids).

My husband knows about Luca and doesn’t have any issues. We’re both very open and honest with each other and he trusts that the friendship is platonic. 

Luca’s wife has started having issues with me recently and it’s causing a big strain in their relationship (which has been rocky for a while). She’s accused him of emotionally cheating and wants us to stop talking. 

I’m pretty sure that I personally am not the problem, but him having a close female friend has become a mountain of an issue since they’ve been fighting about other things.

I really value this friendship and he has become one of my closest friends. I want to do anything I can to help, but if she pulls the “her or me” card we don’t know what we’re going to do.

[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/s/Apokkda2mV) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/s/ynZsu1nFBk) | Next

Day 16,330

The last nine days have been a blur of grinding resistance. We are trapped in what Ryu instantly dubbed a Gravity Storm—a volatile, turbulent region of the galactic core's gravitational field that our models failed to predict. It is a terrifying, invisible tempest.

The ship is constantly under immense, uneven stress. The gravitational influence is not a steady pull; it oscillates wildly between 1.0g and 1.5g across the hull, like a giant, invisible hand shaking the Odyssey.

I have been on the Bridge almost non-stop, operating on adrenaline and recycled coffee. The training simulations that once felt like punishment are now our reality.

""Gravitational shear on the stern plating!"" Ryu yelled, his voice strained as he wrestled with the controls. ""Pressure reading 150% above nominal in Sector 4!""

""August, report!"" I barked into the comms.

""The Haven Ring seams are holding, June, thanks to the Ky’lar alloys!"" August's voice crackled back, tight with stress. ""But the original reactor shielding is vibrating loose. We're getting an energy flux spike!""

I had to simultaneously manage two things: the ship's physical integrity and its trajectory. Every two minutes, I had to initiate a tiny, precise counter-burn from the attitude thrusters to keep the nose from being thrown too far off the aggressive vector. The alternative—falling back onto the wide, conservative path—would mean decades of lost time, a cost the ship could not afford.

The gravity storms were worst in the habitat rings. Elias and Lyra were strapped into padded restraints in the Haven Ring nursery, supervised by Tori and Mina, who were working around the clock to ensure the plant life—which is incredibly sensitive to gravity shifts—was also secured.

""How are the kids?"" I managed to ask Tori during a brief comms window.

""They're fine, June,"" she replied, a slight tremor in her voice. ""Elias thinks it’s a game. He’s calling it the 'Cosmic Rollercoaster.' But the Aethel grain is struggling with the 1.5g cycles. Stay on that aggressive path, Pilot. We need that short travel time.""

Day 16,335

The oscillations intensified. The G-forces became so violent that the inertial dampeners—which had worked flawlessly for decades—couldn't compensate fully. The interior of the ship was constantly lurching and settling.

I remembered my father’s notes on the nebula encounter. He wrote about the fear of the unknown. This was worse. The enemy was invisible, untouchable, and everywhere.

I pulled back the manual control stick, counteracting a sudden, massive pull that threatened to spin us broadside to the core. Sweat was dripping into my eyes.

""We can't sustain this level of micro-burns!"" Ryu argued, pointing to the fuel gauge. ""We're burning through stabilizer fuel faster than anticipated. We'll be dry before Point Zeta if this continues!""

I paused, breathing deeply. This was the moment of decision. The safe choice: cut the engines, let the gravity storm throw us into a wider orbit, and save the fuel. The pilot’s choice: trust the ship's durability and find a pattern.

""There's a pattern here,"" I realized, staring at the chaotic sensor data. ""Look at the periodicity. The surges follow the rotation of the inner core. It's like a wave.""

I grabbed the controls and started flying the ship not against the pull, but with it. Instead of fighting the oscillation, I timed the counter-burns to coincide with the lowest point of the pull cycle, using the peak 1.5g surge to slightly slingshot us forward. It was insane, counter-intuitive, and it worked.

Day 16,339

Just as suddenly as it began, the Gravity Storm dissipated. The gravitational field smoothed out, returning to a near-perfect, steady 1.1g pull—the predictable influence of the Black Hole’s leading edge.

The bridge was covered in empty coffee cups and exhausted pilots. The silence was absolute, save for the low hum of the reactor.

""It's over,"" Ryu whispered, checking the telemetry. ""We’re out of the turbulent zone. Back on the calculated vector. Stable.""

I slumped in my chair, physically and mentally drained. ""August, report?""

""Minor structural fatigue across the main habitat ring, Pilot, but nothing critical,"" August reported, his voice filled with relief. ""The new shielding held. The ship is intact.""

""Tori?""

""All systems green,"" Tori replied, her voice soft. ""The seeds are fine. The ship is dirty, June, but we're alive.""

We had survived the unexpected, premature gravitational contact.

Day 16,340

We spent the entire day in the Haven Ring conference room, documenting the event. We officially logged the phenomenon as a Gravity Storm—a dynamic instability in the galactic core's field, likely caused by localized black hole mergers or neutron star interaction.

""We need a protocol for this,"" I insisted. ""We can't fly 1,700 people through the core region blind.""

Ryu and I worked late into the night, synthesizing the chaotic sensor data into a coherent response plan.

Gravity Storm Protocol (GSP) Final Draft:

 \* Pilot Response: Immediate commitment to aggressive trajectory; utilize G-forces as propulsion via timed micro-burns. Avoid conventional counter-burns to conserve fuel.

 \* Engineering Response: Full power to inertial dampeners; manual inspection of all hull seams and reactor shielding. Priority monitoring on Haven Ring.

 \* Life Support Response: Maximum cushioning and restraint deployment in all habitat sections; temporary suspension of non-critical nutrient recycling cycles to conserve power.

The GSP was approved unanimously by the Council. We now had a plan for the next unexpected wave.

More importantly, the brief, intense trial had erased any lingering doubt about the Hybrid Trajectory. The storm had forced us onto an even tighter, more aggressive path for nine days, and the ship—thanks to the materials and the training—had handled it.

I updated the logs with the revised numbers. The storm, though harrowing, had actually given us a small time advantage.

Time to Point Zeta: 5 Years, 9 Months, 2 Weeks.

Time to Andromeda (Revised again): 137 years, 9 months.

Status: Gravity Storm Survived. New Protocol Implemented. Back on Aggressive Trajectory.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I’ve always been complimented and have several global companies who love me and have given me standing job offers (when I’m ready to jump). All the offers are business side with ownership. This isn’t to be cocky. I highly value people and know how to navigate politics.

Anyways, I like this guy that I interact with at work. We are at the end of the project and I really wanted to ask him for lunch or coffee. However, he made a comment that made me pause. His department doesn’t see the value he adds by interacting well with other departments. My department and the others LOVE working with him. He is also the motivation I needed to push to have a regional first and we think a first for the entire company. He has been pushing my team for a year and I was the first one to successfully do it. \*I did it out of spite but didn’t give up at the end because I know he would appreciate it.\* Every one on one interaction with this guy made it feel like something was there and it was why I was waiting until we were done before saying anything.

I need to now go talk to him about why I need him to be more involved and how I can help him use this to promote why he’s an amazing asset. The amount of money we will save is insane once we set this as a precedent. I can build the document but need his technical side and his historical data to build everything out. He saw the vision and I just implemented because I trusted and respect him.

I’m so sad because I really like this guy but I see so much real potential and so much talent that my leadership brain needs to step in.

I see a lot of posts complaining about inconsistencies between coffee settings and grind recommendation, I I’ve been playing around with the Ninja Luxe and realized something that might clear up the confusion about the “strength” settings and weird changes in suggested grind size. The strength on the Luxe doesn’t actually change anything about brew method or temperature - it basically just changes **how much water** gets used.

* **Strength 1** = more water = coarser grind needed (so the water can flow through properly).
* **Strength 3** = less water = finer grind (because the water needs more contact time).

If Ninja Luxe tried to change grind requirements between all strength levels *and* between single and double baskets, it would get ridiculous - you’d have to constantly tweak your grind size every time you switch. That’s probably why they kept the strength behavior simple and tied it to water volume instead.

My advice: pick **one strength per basket** and dial in your grind size for that setup. Once it’s dialed, stick to it. Also, always **purge between basket swaps** \- leftover fine grounds at the bottom can throw off your next shot and confuse your extraction results.

Another note I can add, often if the machine suggests one grind size, i grind it 1 level finer: if it suggests 5 I'd grind 4, because the extra pressure makes fuller/stronger shots.

Also if you have/prefer darker beans - chocolate flavor etc, set the machine temperature to high, and keep it medium for fruity/light roasts (default is medium)",1,1766066852.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,0,1.0,False

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1pprm3x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pprm3x,Philippine Scout Lt Edwin Price Ramsey led the last American Cavalry charge in 1942 and after became a guerilla commander in the Philippines (Info Below),"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Ramsey

Being heavily outnumbered on January 16th, 1942 Lt. Ramsey led a 26-man cavalry charge against the Japanese in the Bataan Peninsula at the ""Village of Morong"". Being surprised by the brazen charge the attacking enemy fled. G troop held it's position for five hours until reinforcements arrived and during the battle Ramsey took shrapnel to his knee. for this action he was awarded a Silver Star and Purple Heart.

The Charge:

""Now I could see scores of Japanese infantry in brown fatigues firing from the village center, and behind them hundreds more wading the river and crowding toward to Batolan bridge. In a few minutes more the main body would be flooding across to seize Morong. Over the rattling gunfire I ordered my troopers to deploy as foragers, and I raised my pistol. A charge would be our only hope to break up the body of Japanese troops and to survive against their superior numbers. For centuries the shock of a mounted charge had proved irresistible; now the circumstances and all my training made it instinctual. I brought my arm down and yelled to my men to charge. Bent prone nearly across the horses' necks, we flung ourselves at the Japanese advance, pistols firing full into their startled faces. A few returned our fire, but most fled in confusion, some wading back into the river, others running madly for the swamps. To them we must have seemed a vision from another century, wide-eyed horse pounding headlong; cheering, whooping men firing from their saddles. The charge broke clear through the advanced unit and carried on to the swamp, where we dismounted and grabbed our rifles from the scabbards.""

After the fall of Bataan Ramsey and Captain Joseph Barker traveled through the jungle, avoiding japanese patrols and met LTC. Claude Thorpe, who was tasked with organizing the guerilla resistance by MacArthur. Thorpe named it the ""Luzon Guerilla force"" and decided it would be split into four separate areas, each commanded by an officer. Barker and Ramsey joined him and officially became guerillas. Barker was given command of the ECLGA (East Central Luzon Guerilla Area) with Ramsey being appointed his deputy. From now on their lives would be in the hands of the Filipino people. Also during the fall of Bataan he was wrongly pronounced dead, but since he was now technically a rebel, they kept it that way for operational security.

""We now were commanders of a nascent guerilla force with responsibility for the vast central plain of Luzon, Bataan, and the city of Manila, and we had not the slightest idea how to go about organizing them. We began timidly, making contact with civic leaders in the nearby town of Porac who were known to be loyal and anti-Japanese. Five of these we commissioned as officers in the ECLGA force and charged them with recruiting local people into Cadres. To each Cadre we assigned a soldier from our headquarters who was to provide basic military training. From the first, Barker and I had to improvise tactics. Under Thorpe's instructions we followed the structural formulae of the Communists guerillas who were already operating in Central Luzon. Called the Hukbalahap, or Huks, these guerillas were the military wing of the Philippine communist party, and they had had years of experience in clandestine organizing. By the time Bataan fell, they were already mobilized and moving swiftly from one battlefield to the next, scavenging weapons and supplies. Their tactics were derived from the writings of Mao Tse-tung, who at that time was supreme commander of the guerilla army in China""

When Thorpe was captured in October 1942, Barker took his place and Ramsey was given command of the ECLGA. While trying to build their numbers and influence, he was also hiding in the jungle, with malaria and dysentery, moving from hideout to hideout to avoid enemy raids. Under him the Guerilla's would reach to a number of 40,000. They used captured and home-made weapons, gathered intelligence (especially for the American invasion), sabotaged Japanese equipment and distributed propaganda.

""No longer was I a rebel lieutenant hiding out in the hills, virtually alone. I was a Major, the Commandering officer of an army of twenty-five thousand that was growing stronger everyday.""

""Accordingly, in November 1943, I issued a series of general orders reconstituting my command. No longer would be follow the Maoist model of cadres; Instead, the resistance would be reorganized along military lines. I divided Luzon into military districts, redesignated our guerilla cadres as regiments, and assigned them numbers and names according to their districts. There were five such districts: Manila, Bataan, Bulacan, Pampanga and Pangasinan-Tarlac. Each had its own commander and it's own Regiments. These would report to our general headquarters, to which would be attached two special mobile combat regiments with responsibility for policing the districts. The structure did away with the inequities and vagaries of the Cadre system, allowed for decentralized control, and made for a more efficient response to the increasingly grave military and counterintelligence situation we faced.""

With the Luzon Guerilla force growing bigger the Japanese caught wind he was in command and put a 100,000 peso bounty on his head and started conducting more raids into the dense jungle. After the American invasion of the Philippines he would be personally awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by General MacArthur for his guerilla activities and promoted to Lieutenant Colonel before going back to the States for medical treatment.

His memoir ""Lieutenant Ramsey's War: From horse soldier to guerilla commander"" was published in 1990. It's where I got most the quotes from.

Distinguished Service Cross Citation: 

""The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Major (Cavalry) Edwin Price Ramsey (ASN: 0-368746), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in the Philippine Islands from 21 April 1942 to 30 April 1945. Major Ramsey was assigned as adjutant and second in command of The East Central Luzon Guerilla Area, comprising seven provinces. He personally organized guerilla forces in Pampanga, Manila, Tarlac, and Pangasinan and, assuming command with the capture of his superior officers on 21 January 1943, coordinated and completed the organization of Guerilla units in Central Luzon. Establishing headquarters on Mount Balabac, north of Montalban, on the outskirts of Manila, Major Ramsey directed intelligence activities, the dissemination of propaganda, and the organization of combat units. By every available courier, intelligence reports were sent to Panay and Mindoro. In October 1944 radio contact was established with General Headquarters, Southwest Pacific Area, which proved invaluable as vital information could now be supplied daily. Commanding 10,000 officers and men, with a reserve of approximately 20,000, Major Ramsey mobilized units which effectively sabotaged and harassed the enemy in every possible manner. Upon the arrival of the American forces in East Central Luzon, he made available to them well organized, armed troops, guides, and intelligence personnel and since that time, supplied more than 4,000 men for the American Army. Major Ramsey, although physically handicapped by illness, through his untiring efforts, organizing ability, commendable courage and outstanding leadership, materially advanced the success of Allied operations in the Philippine Islands.""

I work in industry so I get up around 5:30am to be at work by 7. When I get up, I mainly just make breakfast, drink a coffee, pack up my work stuff, and leave. 

My landlords are a young couple, they are digital nomads/photographers. Work for themselves type of vibe. They have been complaining that I make too much noise in the mornings. For context, it is just me in the suite, the ceiling are extremely low (like 7feet) and the suite is directly below their bedroom. They say that their previous tenant was on the similar schedule to them (whatever that means) and they didn’t realize how much noise \*reverberates\* through the house until I moved in. I told them I would make an effort to be quieter in the mornings, but I wasn’t sure how much of a difference it would make. I’ve been trying my best, I changed up my routine by not doing dishes in the morning and making my lunch the night before. Apparently this isn’t helping. 

In my opinion, I don’t think I’m the problem. The main issue is that the house older, probably poorly insulated and they probably shouldn’t have built a basement suite directly under their bedroom. I’m not sure how to get this across to them. I’ve tried being a cooperative as possible but it’s not ideal to have to tiptoe around your house. I love everything about my suite and the location, so ideally I don’t want to move out.

Anyone have any ideas about how I can go about this with my landlords and any solutions that don’t require me to move out?",2,1766066658.0,vancouverhousing,0,1.0,False

Whether it's the 70 minutes that aired or the 90 minutes on home video, that's simply not enough time to get a good portrait of 30 years of the band. Given that each Monkee contributed four-hour interviews for the project, and other participants gave similarly long talks, that should've been used to build a really good, strong project, one that didn't rely so much on episode footage and entire songs.

Now, it certainly didn't have to be as long as The Beatles Anthology by any means, which certainly wasn't even possible at that point in time for the band, but it should've been more than it was.

I would've made it a two-night event, with each night 90 minutes each.

As for the book, I would've had it been quite a hefty tome to be sure, to essentially use as much of their interviews as possible.",3,1766066648.0,Monkees,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone! I've been working on **Memorive** \- think of it as your personal AI memory assistant that never forgets anything you tell it.

# The Problem I Was Trying to Solve

Ever had this happen? You remember having a conversation about something important, but can't recall the details. Or you had a brilliant idea weeks ago that's now lost in a sea of notes. Your brain is amazing, but it's not designed to perfectly recall every detail of your life.

# How Memorive Works

It's dead simple:

1. **Memory Mode**: Tell it anything - type or speak. ""Met Sarah at the coffee shop, she's working on a startup in fintech."" Done. It's stored and indexed.
2. **Chat Mode**: Later, just ask naturally. ""What did Sarah say about her startup?"" Boom - instant recall with full context.
3. **Spaces**: Keep things organized. Separate spaces for work, personal life, projects, whatever. You can even share spaces with team members for collaborative knowledge bases.

# Other functions

* **Voice recording** \- speak your thoughts on the go (perfect for those ""shower thoughts"")
* **Natural language AI** \- no weird commands or syntax, just talk to it like a person
* **Shared spaces** \- collaborate with friends or teammates

# Real Use Cases People Are Using It For

* Journaling without the hassle of organizing entries
* Tracking project knowledge across teams
* Storing personal relationships details (birthdays, preferences, stories)
* Building a second brain for research and learning

# Try It Free

Free tier includes 1000 memories per space - plenty to test it out. I'm genuinely excited to hear what you think and how you'd use it!

I tried one last time to swallow and something happened in there that felt like my stomach had punched itself in the stomach. My teeth felt like each one had been hooked up to tiny jumper cables with diesel trucks hooked up to the other ends.

I opened my mouth to scream or throw up—whichever one got to the finish line first and the mouthful of water *steamed my face* as it came out as hot vapor. I gripped the sink, unable to breathe, unable to do anything more than be held at the mercy of my lurching guts.

I convulsed for an unending minute, my mind distancing from my body, a guttural, *ERP... ERP... ERP*... coming from the root of me and out of my mouth. I observed me in my mind’s eye, doing a modified twerk, as whatever was in me threatened to come out.

Then it ended.

It stopped as easily as it had begun and I felt... fine. My stomach hurt, but it was more of an ache like I’d just done a thousand stomach crunches in about twenty-seven seconds. I looked at my hands and it took a good six seconds to interpret that I’d squeezed finger-shaped grooves into the metal sink.

Likewise, my shoes had been ruined. As best as I could guess, I’d curled my toes and exploded my feet out of them, ripping the soles mostly from the rest of the shoes. I removed them with my feet, bent to scoop them up—

Shit, that was a mistake. Blood rushed to my head and a vision of a creature that looked like a human being from the neck down, but its head was a massive knurled fist of flesh, with a nest of large human teeth about the size of the palm of my hand, with a little sexy gap between the front two.

It was just standing there, against a brick wall, its head to the side. Or maybe that was how it ‘faced’ forward. It had a single, lidless eye about the size of two fifty-cent pieces put together. But there was a group of men, leaning over a table. I couldn’t see what kind of table it was and tried to pull back from the vision, but it was definite that they were eating.

And from the arm and leg of one of them, I was pretty sure that was me.

“Hey, you ready to go?” Nolte tapped me on the shoulder.

I looked at him, shoes still in my hand. He looked refreshed. For a moment, I thought he must have shaved and given himself a couple shots of Botox.

“Yeah,” I said. “I just need to change.”

I fled to the bedroom and sniffed a glimpse of the bathroom on the way. I was prepared for a stench, assuming he’d firebombed the toilet, but it was disturbingly minty fresh despite the fact my toothpaste, mouthwash, and any other toiletry I’d put in there not being spearmint-flavored.

I closed and locked my bedroom door. I didn’t really want to change clothes, but I’d put myself on that hook. It didn’t feel right to put clean clothes on a dirty body. Fortunately, my clothes hamper was in here.

I dug through it until I found a shirt and jeans that weren’t offensive beyond a two-foot radius and tossed them onto the bed. I took off what I was wearing and dropped the items where I stood, thinking I should hurry. I didn’t think Nolte was a thief, but I wouldn’t have assumed he was a chloroform-huffer, either.

I tugged on the shirt and picked out a new pair of drawers. Dirty or no, I could justify wearing clean underwear from my mother’s teachings. I toed at my underwear and spotted an unsettling *gray* streak right where my buttcrack would’ve been. I scooped them up with my foot and deftly tossed them into the hamper.

I put on the pants and turned for the door when my other pants caught my eye. Peeking out of the rear pocket was the corner of something white. I took a step toward it and consciously knelt to pluck it out.

It was a picture of me, smiling with red gristle between my teeth, holding the remnants of a barbecued *something*, slathered in what I hoped was sauce. A bald, older white man was standing next to me, an arm around my shoulder, giving a thumb’s up. I made a mental note of the gap between his teeth.

In the white border beneath the photo in a semi-cursive font was the text, “I Skulled Sloppy’s Meat Challenge!”

I’d been to the Sloppy Skull before. They had a bar. I *hated* that place, though. The bartender couldn’t make an old-fashioned worth a damn, it took forever to even get a drink, and the wings were terrible. And I hated food challenges, too.

I had to have gone there with someone or met somebody. Considering Shorty was the closest person I had to a friend, and he didn’t work there, clues were sparse.

But it was something to go on.

I tucked the photo back in my pocket and stepped out of the bedroom. Nolte had dragged my wing-backed chair over to my coffee table and was seated in it. He folded something up and tucked it into his jacket before I could get a good look at it.

“Ready to roll?” he said, swiping at the underside of his nose as he stood.

I wanted to ask him, but answering would be investing myself in his life more than I was interested in. Instead, I just headed for the front door. Nolte hustled to catch up and I locked up behind us.

“I gotta make a stop,” I said.

“Found something that filled in a little bit of the gap for you?”

“What? Yeah.” I unlocked the car and we piled in. “How’d you know?”

“You look like a guy who’s lost something he needed and gained something he didn’t want.” He shrugged.

I plugged The Sloppy Skull into my GPS and had it route us while I started the car and buckled up.

“Besides,” Nolte said. “All things that happen are meant to be.”

That was nonsense. It was easily ignorable, though.

“Right,” I said, and backed out of the spot. It took about fifteen minutes to get to the Sloppy Skull and thankfully, Nolte was quiet. I thought he might have fallen asleep, but when I glanced at him while we were stopped at a red light, he'd taken an arm out of his jacket and was reading something tattooed on the inside of his forearm. He was tracing the words with a finger and moving his lips.

“What’s that?” I said.

“An old Hindi poem,” he said without looking up. “It's about bravery even in the face of certain death. Do you want me to read it out loud to you?”

“No thanks,” I said. “Not planning on facing certain death today.”

I pulled into the lot of The Sloppy Skull and parked in a spot near the door.

“You coming?”

“Nah, nah.” He waved me on. “You go ahead. Last thing I need is another drink. Get me a burger if you would, though.”

I left Nolte in my car, having no intention of bringing him anything. I didn't offer curbside service.

I passed the host's stand, headed for the bar. I didn't recognize any of the employees and didn't hold out hope anyone would be able to offer insight on why I'd been here.

“Hey, Fuck You!” I turned to see a waiter smiling and pointing at me. “Fuck You, *man*, how are you?”

I wished I'd been sitting so I could stand for dramatic effect.

“I thought we'd never see you again.”

“Oh my god, Fuck You?” A pretty blonde young enough to be my daughter passed in the opposite direction. “How are you?”

I checked my anger for the time being. Something else was going on here.

“Sorry, last night was a bit of a blur,” I said.

The waiter nodded. “That makes *total* sense. After you ate all that meat last night, you looked like you were gonna die. Hold on, I'll be right back.”

I watched him go into the kitchen and come back out with two plastic cups filled with pop. He lifted one toward me and continued into the dining area where he placed them in front of a lovely-looking couple. He took their order and came back, tucking a thing that looked like it had spawned from an iPad and a graphing calculator into his apron.

“Like I was saying, bro,” he said, walking over to me. “You were a total legend last night. How are you even upright?”

“I did the meat challenge.” I shrugged and pointed to the wall of fame that had at least three dozen pictures on it. “I'm not the first.” I figured I was the first he'd seen. But the smile on his face widened.

“Bro, you really *don't* remember last night. You didn't just get Skulled. You got Skulled *twice.*”

That was news. The floor chittered beneath my feet.

I dug the picture out of my back pocket. I pointed at the other guy.

“Who's that?”

The waiter shrugged. “A friend of yours, so far as I know.”

I shook my head.

“They were cheering you on like they knew you.”

“Hold up. *They*?”

“C'mon, there's no way you forgot that redhead. I mean, you took her home after you left here, didn't you?”

“Redhead?”

“Dude.” He held his hand horizontally somewhere above his head, indicating her height. “*Dude*.” He waved a hand over his face, indicating she'd been beautiful. “*Duuuuude.*” He held both hands in front of him with fingers spread, indicating—

“Steve, where the hell are you?” A guy in the kitchen was staring at the waiter from the service window adjacent to the bar.

“Oh! Bro, sorry.” He looked between us, holding a finger up for me to wait where I was.

I waited as patiently as I could while he ran food to another table. He was on his way back when another order of his came up. I tortured myself mentally, wondering what Nolte was doing in my car. Probably heroine.

“So where was I?” he said when he finally came back. According to the nametag on his shirt, his name was Justin.

“Redhead and somebody else cheering me on while I Skulled myself.”

“Ha. Funny.” He smiled like he was humoring me and I got the distinct impression he wasn't just sharing for my sake. Justin wanted something. Hopefully, he'd get around to what soon.

“Who was she, by the way?” he asked. “The redhead, I mean.”

There it was. He wanted *her.* I had no idea who she was or even remembered her. Being honest couldn't hurt.

“I don't remember anything about last night.”

Justin gave a big nod.

""You don't have her number or anything? Like on your phone?”

I shrugged. “I don't know her name. I mean, maybe. Maybe not.”

“Would you mind checking? I mean, she's not your girlfriend or anything if you don't remember her, right?”

I took out my phone. He had a point. I might've called or texted someone.

I'd called my father after work. He'd just had back surgery and I wanted to see how he was. I remembered that much. But there wasn't anything after that.

“Looks like I must have met her here.” I shook my head and looked at Justin. “I didn't call or text.”

“Well, you didn't meet her here. The two of you came in together. You sat down with the other guy. Trust me, you notice a woman like that.”

He was about to go back to one of his tables and paused. Justin took an order pad out of his apron. He wrote something on the corner of a ticket, tore it off, and handed it to me.

“If you see her, would you give her my number?”

“Sure, kid.” I stood, thinking I'd taken this particular path as far as I could. But wait. “One more thing. The guy we met up with, what did he look like?”

“Like number three on the Wall of Fame.” Justin thumbed over his shoulder.  “I think you must have challenged him or something. I mean, everybody was watching when you ate the second one. But it was all in good fun. You guys bought a round of shots for everybody.”

He went and I walked to the wall to get a better look at Mr. Number Three. He was smiling next to the same baldheaded man as the one in my picture. I took it out and held it up.

Wait, that was odd. I'd supposed the date on the camera must not have been set before, but the two pictures had the same date. Two years ago, today. What's more, I did recognize him.

But I couldn't place where I'd seen that face before. Not work, not Shorty's, and not any other place I could think of. Here was the obvious answer, but that didn't fill the right spot in my mind. Like a puzzle piece that didn't quite fit.

I looked over the other pictures. There was one. Number Thirty-four, and when I looked long enough, I realized I recognized number Two as well.

Ms. Number Two, Mr. Number Three, and Mr. Number Thirty-four.

They were all in cheap, dollar-store frames, only the date on Mr. Number Three showing. I couldn’t help but wonder if the dates on the other two were significant. I had to know.

I looked around. Servers were milling about. Justin was somewhere floating around and he was the only one who’d really taken notice of me. Wait, a female server had, too, but I hadn’t seen her in a while. Maybe I could do this without anyone noticing me.

I had to do this quick, before I could think about it too hard.

I grabbed Ms. Number Two’s picture off the wall and flipped it over. How the hell was I supposed to get this open? I tried to dig into what I thought was cardboard. I didn’t see what was holding the back in. I gave it a shake, not knowing what else to do.

“Hey, what are you doing?”

Every hair on my body stood up as my index slipped into the corner of the frame. I wedged the back up and held it there.

“Uh, nothing. Just takin’ a look.”

“I slide my finger in farther, making eye contact with the server to keep her distracted.”

“What?” she said.

“I have a tendency to narrate what I’m doing when I get nervous,” I said. “Finally, I pry the back off the photo. I break eye contact to extract the photo from the frame and turn it over.

“It’s the same date.”

“What?” she said again.

It could have been a fluke, but I had to know.

“I reach for the other photograph. Mr. Number Thirty-four.”

“What?”

“I take advantage of her confusion as I try to open the third frame. My shaky hands don’t cooperate and in my frustration, I smash the frame over my knee.”

“Hey! Don’t do that!”

“I’ve cut myself, but the pain is a ghost of itself. I feel a chill buzzing in my bones.

“It’s the same date,” I said.

“Oh my god, you’re bleeding!”

“I’m taking these,” I said to her. Before I left, I snatched Mr. Number Three from the wall.

Her face changed.

“You come on back to the Soggy Skull any ol’ time,” she said. “Or Shorty’s. Doesn’t matter.” The walls were all humming in harmony and the door from Shorty’s appeared in the wall next to her.

The doorknob twitched and it creaked open just a bit, a sliver of light laying across her foot.

I backed off. *Way* off.

The server’s eyes seemed to not be a part of what the rest of her was doing. It was like she was partially possessed. She didn’t move or give any sign she was going to give chase. Her eyes darted all around, wide in panic, but something about her seemed to be observing me as I almost jogged backward.

I was afraid to turn my back on her. Like she would transform into a fanged something that would lap me up with its papillae.

I had no idea why I even knew that word.

I backed into someone and he steadied me with a firm hand on my arm.

“I almost scream.”

“Watch out for my kid!”

“I turn around and see a heavyset, middle-aged man with his ugly child.”

“Hey!”

“The walls were all singing and the floor drums under my feet. The music made from every surface dances in my eyes, coalescing into a song that promises to climax if I open this man’s throat and spill his life.”

“Uh, honey, let’s let this nice gentleman go by.”

I finally pushed my way outside. It felt like the door was hovering over me like a fly swatter. The bright sky cleansed me. If the sun weren’t obscured by clouds, I felt like it might have chased out the illness in the pit of me, leeching into my bones.

I bent over, grabbing onto my knees for dear life as I caught my breath. My heart raced like I’d been running for my life, although I’d barely managed more than a brisk walk over fifty feet or so.

My knee felt particularly warm and I saw blood from my hand was soaking into my jeans. I stood and looked at my hand. A wound like a mouth had slitted diagonally from just below my index to the heel of my palm. Where had this come from? I’d cut my finger opening the picture frame.

The wound pursed its lips as if it were waiting for a kiss, then slid shut. Something like the last dregs of a milkshake being sucked up by a straw was somewhere near me. I looked down at my knee to see the blood that had stained my jeans was receding until it was gone.

The vibrating in the middle of me that I hadn’t noticed until this moment stopped.

The last five minutes had been akin to the worst high I’d ever had, but it had ended instantly.

I’d crushed the frame holding Mr. Number Three’s photo. I carefully plucked it out from the glass, the other two pictures balled up in my other hand.

I took the biggest shard of glass from the frame. It was thin and that much sharper. Something unmarred in my mind told me to shove that piece of broken glass into my throat and to keep slashing until I’d come as close as I could to decapitating myself. That my will alone would be enough to end whatever this was. But then the moment was done.

It made no sense to do it, but I knew I wouldn’t be wounded. I balled up my fist around that piece of glass, squeezing it tight until my arm shook, then opened my hand. The glass had been crushed into grains as fine as sand.

An older couple passed me and I smiled at them, trying to reassure them that they weren’t looking at a psycho. I’d parked right next to the entrance and my mind went to Nolte. It was apparent why he hadn’t gotten out of the car to help me.

He was fucking asleep.

Like in deep, deep sleep. His head was pitched back, mouth open, and he was snoring loud enough I could hear him from outside the car.

I was mad for reasons I couldn’t identify. I got in the car and slammed the door as hard as I could. He came awake instantly, looking around confused momentarily.

“You smell like blood,” he said.

“What are you talking about?”

“You. Are you cut?” The question pushed me off the argument I’d been mounting in my head.

“I... I don’t think so.”

“Better be safe than sorry. Let’s go back to your place so you can get cleaned up.”

“Why?”

“Because if it smells blood, that door will open the wrong way.”

I work IT for a small company. This girl emailed me this morning, with her entire team CC’d, and said this:

Hi [Me],

I’m having trouble with my VPN ☹ I took some screenshots, could you take a look and let me know how to proceed? Copying the group in case they run into the same issue when they get in.
 
Thanks,
[Her name]

And there was a word doc attached called “VPN screenshots.” 

I opened the document and saw just a little holiday card pasted in it. I assumed she must have accidentally included the wrong thing, so I replied back to everyone and said “ I unfortunately don’t see the screenshot in that doc ☹ I checked your account and your password does expire in about 10 days, but it’s still valid currently. What does the error say when you try to connect? Does it send you the MFA notification or not get that far?” 

She replied back and was like “Lol are you sure you see NOTHING in the document?” Which slightly clued me in so I looked again and it’s a little robot guy with a Christmas tree made of IT stuff. So I replied back and made a joke about not having my coffee yet (I don’t drink coffee but I know that’s a common thing in an office job lol) and thanked them all.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1pprf4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/1pprf4c/dating_sucks/,dating sucks.,"as a 23 year old black young woman, I finally believe my mind is maturing, and I’m beginning to realize a lot of things about myself that the younger versions of me would not have been able to accept. which has been a very insightfully yet bittersweet experience so far. 

Recently, I have been simply yearning for relationship that seems to be close but far away im my future. I feel like in due time it will come my way, but I’m really fighting the urge to force it, despite me already, knowing that it won’t be good for my mental health or my self image. I went out of town  for some time, and decided to get back on the apps to see what else is out there outside of my big but, small town. I quickly became pissed off with the process; people saying “hey baby” or just “hey” with very shallow compliments or remarks simply pissed me off and quickly convinced me to delete the apps shortly after downloading them. My friends were quite astonished by my resolve, as in the past i would entertain the people i matched with in the hopes of finding “the one”.  it didn’t take a lot for me to decipher the bullshit that was coming for me this time and immediately delete the apps. I realized that the parasocial relationships dating apps give us no longer has a purpose in my life. And it seems like God doesn’t intend for me to find my partner like that seeing that I’m so opposed to the idea of it that it makes my head hurt lol. I’m starting to realize that I want something real. I no longer crave the sparks immediately flying and the instant attraction, I no longer crave the butterflies and racing heart and blinding love.  I want something long-lasting, slow, warm, gentle and comforting. Like a good slow burn book. 

It hasn’t been helping I’ve been reading a lot of slow romance novels and comics that focus on the small actions. It’s nurturing the idea of having something slow, steady, and wholesome. Like bumping into an old classmate and starting a friendship, or randomly chatting with someone I met at a coffee shop or at a grocery store. Leading to us touching elbows when walking, genuine interest in what we say and why, the sensuality of caring for others and who they are, and actually asking someone out on a date that ends at a decent time at night in us both going our separate ways and reminiscing on the date we had. What I want is something that our current culture doesn’t push, and at times I feel like I’ll never have that moment because most people are on apps or value social media. I’d love to find my person without the use of that.

I’m also realizing that sex is something extremely sacred to me.  I no longer feel comfortable with the idea of flings, hook ups, or any relationship that evolves or has a foundation around the transaction of sexual favors. I want that to be the last thing that happens between me and whoever I end up with. growing up I was obsessed with a fantasy of what love and relationship relationships are supposed to look like, thinking that relationships are supposed to be easy and filled of butterflies and laughter. But I’m starting to realize and except that relationships are a lot more complex than that. it’s definitely taking a while for me to realize that, but I’m very glad that I have.

The place we’re planning to go is pretty western-style, but it has really nice lights and a good vibe. My original plan was simple: walk around, talk, and grab some coffee. But there’s also a concert playing there that night, and it includes a dance floor.

I’m a pretty decent two-stepper, so the thought was we could dance a bit, keep it light and fun, and still have time to just talk and hang out.

I just bought the tickets too...soooo.  She did text me goodmorning at 4am though. ""Good morning, (emoji) I work today so i beat you to it. I hope you have a good day :))"". 

So she sounds pretty interest in me. I am just overtly nervous because its been a while since I've gotten back out there in the dating world.

Here are some of the crops that have saved me the most money: 

1. Tomatoes. I just grow cherry tomatoes because they’re highly productive. I cook them and then freeze them in yogurt containers, they last me until January, February if I’m careful. These will grow in big half barrels if you don’t have a lot of space.

2. Greens (Kale, Basil, Mustard, Lettuce) Pretty easy to grow and produces early and then all summer/fall even into November this year. Kale will grow in big pots, use lots of compost for a better yield. I make pesto or kale chips or just salad. 

3. Beans (Bush beans and climbing) 

These grow incredibly well (bush beans) in pots. Extremely productive. 

4. Squash (Butternut or Acorn) 

This takes a bit more space and needs to climb but provides a tonne of food in the fall (soup and it freezes well too) that will store well. 

5. Root Vegetables (Radishes, Potatoes, Onions, Carrots, Beets) 

Radishes grow especially fast. Haven’t mastered the beets or carrots yet but got some nice big onions this year and they seem to store really well. I grew potatoes from seed and was surprised by how productive they were, also in containers. 

6. Hot Peppers (Scorpion, Jalapeño, Cayenne, Habanero, Poblano) I add these to everything for flavour, ferment them for hot sauce, give them away as gifts - these come in so many beautiful colours and have actually made cooking so much fun, I can’t recommend growing them enough. They grow in pots and are surprisingly hardy. 

I know there’s a start-up cost and it’s not an option for people living in condos or apartments without balconies. But it’s free once it’s set up and it’s brought me so much sanity and I basically don’t buy groceries in the summer, just the absolute necessities like oil and coffee. I see so much wasted space in these huge school yards that could be feeding entire communities, so much public space that could be an oasis of fresh food production and security. 

I’m not rich but this subreddit makes my heart hurt for people struggling with bills and gardening is the smartest financial move I have made in years, plus it’s meditative and makes me happy - just wanted to share something positive, I hate that people are hungry in a country like Canada.

1pprcvb,https://i.redd.it/sv50w2azwy7g1.jpeg,Something is loading before Christmas.,"You can feel it in the jobs report, the earnings calls, and the way “restructuring” suddenly became everyone’s favorite Q4 verb.

Jobs report: flatline with a fever  
November payrolls barely clawed back 64,000 jobs after a 105,000 drop in October, with unemployment now at a four‑year high of 4.6%.  

This isn’t a clean collapse; it’s a slow bleed. Companies freezing and trimming instead of hiring into 2026.
McKinsey and Verizon as signal flares  
McKinsey is preparing to cut roughly 10% of its non‑client‑facing workforce, thousands of white‑collar jobs explicitly tied to AI and “efficiency.”  

Verizon is cutting more than 13,000–15,000 roles, up to 15% of staff, to “reorient” the company while it’s still profitable.

The economic indicators are glowing red, like a pilot’s compass in the Bermuda Triangle.

Line up the jobs data, the consulting cuts, and the Verizon‑scale announcements, then ask: if this is what they’re willing to do before the holidays, what do you think Q1 looks like for the people who still believe they’re not on the cost line?

Believe it or not, Gen X is on the cost line now.

1pprctj,https://www.reddit.com/r/OntarioTeachers/comments/1pprctj/rude_secretary_encounter_ot/,Rude secretary encounter (OT),"I’m currently an OT for YCDSB and have been Occasional teaching for a bit over a year now. Most of the secretary’s that I come across are quite pleasant and very warm and welcoming but some are just plain mean rude and miserable. 

So I slightly messed up but this secretary blew it way out of proportion. I didn’t know until this encounter that I wasn’t allowed to leave during prep periods, but long story short I had a morning prep so I went to go get a coffee quickly. I’ve been doing this at most schools that I supply at and no one had ever said anything to me about it before, and mind you all the secretaries at other schools have seen me go and come back during prep periods because you have to ring the doorbell in order to enter the building again. Anyways when I returned to the school the secretary greeted me at the door and said “Did you just leave.” I said “Yes I went to go get a coffee quickly.” She said “ok ur not supposed to do that you can’t just leave and if u do u have to let me know.” And I said “Oh I’m sorry I wasn’t aware, so sorry about that.” I proceeded to walk away after that interaction but my intuition told me she wasn’t satisfied enough by my response and wanted to create a bigger issue. 

Sure enough I was right. 30 mins later she barges into the class that I’m supplying for and says in a demeaning tone “Hey so I let the principal know, and we’re going to contact the board. You really shouldn’t be leaving during your prep, because if something happens to you that’s our responsibility and you’re supposed be here because you’re getting paid.” I said “I’m really sorry I wasn’t aware of that policy until today.” She said “I’m not sure how long you’ve been supplying for but those are the rules and your hiring manager should have told you that. If you don’t wanna be here then don’t come here.” I said “I never said I don’t want to be here, I honestly was not aware but now I am and I apologize.” Anyways she continued to give me attitude and say things that were out of pocket and kept saying “I don’t know how long you’ve been supplying for.” And this interaction occurred when the kids were coming in from recess infront of the volunteer and EA, so you could imagine how humiliating it felt. When she left I was so embarrassed and also extremely worried that I would lose my position because of a short coffee break. I was also so upset at how she spoke to me and quietly shed a few tears in the corner while the kids were eating their snack. I really couldn’t help myself in that moment and I don’t know if any of the adults in the room noticed but I really hope they didn’t. 

I was going to let it go and just see what happens but I was so bothered by the way she spoke to me that I had to go speak to someone about it. Anyways at lunch I walk to the office and greet whoever is there and say “I was wondering if I could speak to the principal.” The lady I greeted who was very warm and kind btw said “The principal isn’t here today but I’m the teacher in charge. You can speak to me about whatever you need and I can pass the message along.” We then proceeded to go to a meeting room and right when I began to speak the tears started flowing and I couldn’t hold myself back because of how upset I was with the way she spoke to me. Anyways I explained everything to her and told her how upset I was by how she spoke to me and said I don’t think it was very kind of her to treat me like that over a misunderstanding. She was very kind and acknowledged that yes I wasn’t supposed to do that but it’s a little misunderstanding and nothing will probably happen if the board is even contacted. I felt comforted when she said that. She said she’ll speak to the secretary on my behalf and let her know how I felt. 

Anyways at last the recess the secretary peeped her head in the door shyly, instead of her barging in energy she had first recess and apologized. She said “Hey I’m so sorry I didn’t mean to make you cry, I just wanted to let you know about the policy for your own safety. I’m not going to do anything just to let you know.” I was a little caught off guard and really didn’t feel like speaking to her so I said “no worries it was just a misunderstanding.” I think she was a little embarrassed cause she didn’t think I would actually speak to someone about what happened for some reason. What I don’t understand is why she said “I’m not going to anything.” If she said “I spoke to the principal and we’re going to contact the board” prior to that. 

Anyways I’m never supplying at the school again but some secretaries are just so rude.    ",5,1766066009.0,OntarioTeachers,1,1.0,False

A coffee shop and public green space will be created at street level, and a large lounge on the top floor will offer city views.

Co-living is aimed mainly at young professionals and recent graduates, usually aged 21 to 35. Rent will include utilities and council tax, and the building will have 24 hour security and organised social activities. Supporters say it offers an alternative to shared flats and buy to let housing.

1ppr9zl,https://www.reddit.com/r/breathwork/comments/1ppr9zl/muscle_fatigue_and_low_energy_caused_by_chronic/,Muscle fatigue and low energy caused by chronic hyperventilation?,"Somewhere around mid-high school, I started noticing that my arms and legs would get sore and tired very quickly. This happened while biking and exercising, and I was constantly exhausted, often falling asleep during classes despite trying to stay awake.

Nowadays, it affects everyday life. Walking up stairs or working with my arms above shoulder height makes my muscles feel like they have no energy, forcing me to rest. Even at work this physically holds me back after screwing above my head, I often need to lower my arms for a few seconds before I can continue.

When I wake up, my back and chest feel quickly fatigued and sore, often with a mild feeling of breath hunger or oxygen shortage.

I also have frequent muscle twitches. People notice that I sigh sometimes and think I’m irritated, but I feel like I’m just trying to get enough air.

I struggle heavily with concentration at work, to the point where colleagues notice it. Coffee helps somewhat. I fall asleep suddenly during meetings, lessons, or while using public transport, even in noisy environments. It comes on abruptly. I’ve also had derealisation since primary school.

At some point, I became afraid I had a muscle or neuromuscular disease. After seeing many doctors, I was referred to the hospital. EMGs of my limbs, respiratory tests, and extensive blood work all came back normal.

Recently, I was tested for chronic hyperventilation and scored 100% on all parts; my carbon dioxide levels were clearly too low. This surprised me, as I never noticed myself hyperventilating. I’ve always known I have social anxiety, sometimes severe, but I never expected it to impact my physical health this much.

I’m still unsure whether all of this can be explained by chronic hyperventilation. At the same time, I’m at least somewhat relieved, and even a bit glad that there is finally something that has been diagnosed.

Hearing from others with similar experiences would really help.",1,1766065792.0,breathwork,0,1.0,False

Will be doing a roadtrip around the state and ending in Nashville, will be there the 31st thru Jan 2. Not much for the NYE bash stuff, haven’t been out in NYE since I went to Hogmanay in Edinburgh 7 years ago, but was curious about what is open Jan 1.  *Does Nashville shut down like most towns or, since it’s touristy, most spots (like coffee shops or restaurants) stay open?*

Thanks!! 

I’ll be staying on music row and will probably wander down to the shenanigans since I’m there but I was hoping for a day or two for chill walks around the city and sitting at coffee shops during my stay since my road trip will be mainly middle of nowhere hiking.

1ppr3qu,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1ppr3qu/my_just_dont_fing_dance_moment_i_just_automated/,"My ""just don't f***ing dance"" moment: I just automated 90% of our L2 maintenance team workload and I'm keeping it to myself","I have been an early adopter of the hype around AI, like LLMs and code assistants like copilot and I was hyped too, I honestly I believed the narrative that says AI won't replace replace humans, but it's more of a productivity multiplier, something to augments devs and ops people and the boring tasks like the writing markdowns or docstrings.  
Then came the agentic stuff which at first I didn't but much into because I was skeptical about vendor lock in. until MCP came along and suddenly my entire workflow at work changed (at the time i was saying it evolved but I'm not in that mood), Terraform MCP, Context 7, k8s MCP,  I was very impressed but still very optimistic about the things we can do with it and how it will improve our daily lives, it connected to our actual infrastructure, it wasn't a gimmick anymore.  
Then come Opus 4.5 and Gemini 3 Pro, people called them beasts so I did what I always do, I pushed the enveloppe to see how far it can go.

**And it went far ..**

I built an agentic app that monitors our nightly CI jobs, watches for failures and errors and maybe rerun if necessary or push small fixes.  
it also monitors certain apps on our k8s cluster and runs the necessary fixes. These fixes aren't magic, it's everything we documented as guidelines for our L2 maintenance team. the ai agent just .. does it. sometimes better than humans, because it creates bug tickets with a level of details I have never seen from a person.

I was beyond hyped, already planning my presentations and my demo and show them how great all of this is.

**Then it hit me.**

I kept thinking about the scene from the big short when Brad Pitt as Ben told the young bankers when they started celebrating betting against the housing market where he said : *""If we're right, people lose homes. People lose jobs. People lose retirement savings, people lose pensions. You know what I hate about fucking banking? It reduces people to numbers. Here's a number - every 1% unemployment goes up, 40,000 people die, did you know that?""*

What I've made doesn't bet against the housing market, but the L2 maintenance team, actual people in our workforce, people i enjoy having coffee with.

So, I kept it to myself ..  but here's the thing, I don't share it, someone else will, or some other company will propose it as a service with the promis of cost reduction and whatnot, my silence won't help anyone, it just means to me that i'm not the one to pull the trigger.

I don't have a clear idea on how to feel about this and i'm not here to moralize anyone, I'm just ... really really confused.

This technology is something genuinely amazing, but somehow, I don't fee like dancing.

**TL;DR:** Built an agentic SRE tool and it effectively was able to replace the whole L2 maintenance team. Realized the human cost and decided to keep it to myself.

Arthur is in his late 50’s, and is a British immigrant, Evie in her early 30’s, and is a Moldovan immigrant. They met because Arthur is an English language professor at a university and Evie was working campus security. Some students dragged her along to his lecture on pride and prejudice - the first book she ever read in English. 

At the end of the lecture she asked Arthur a barrage of questions, and they grabbed coffee to discuss the book. 

Within the next weeks the students encouraged Arthur to date her and he did. For a year before marrying her. 

Evie has two toddlers from her previous relationship, a little boy named James who’s 3 and a little girl who is nearly 2. 

Arthur and Evie decide to buy a new house, bigger and older because they are considering having a baby together. Unfortunately Evie’s younger sister has recent died and she was struggling to cope with it, her doctors out her on some anti depressants to help. 

As they move into the house, Arthur is spotted but a bunch of fans of his old vampire romance novel. The type of book that is trashy. But it’s a massive hit with teenagers. He wrote it as a young man. In his 20’s. He signs some things takes some picture. The pictures end yo online. No one thinks about it. 

Four days after moving into there new house, after his wife starts her new anti depressants - she has a nightmare. A woman crawls out of there ancient built in wardrobe and watches her sleep. 

Evie tells Arthur, and Arthur trying to be local, presses a kiss to her cheek and tells her it’s just the side affect of the meds. And she believes him. 

And this is the decent into madness. Over the next year, Evie is hospitalised, put on psych holds, assessed for schizophrenia and doubts herself non stop. 

Food and clothes are going missing, their children are talking about an imaginary friend who comes out at night and promised ti look after the when mama dies. She wants to believe she is just suffering psychosis. It’s all a delusion. That’s what the doctors tell her. It’s what Arthur keeps telling her. Because no one, for even a second, thinks there is woman giving in the crawl space before the access panel in the wardrobe. 

When Evie asks after one evening ‘if I go missing, will you believe someone took me? Or will you just think I ran away going mad?’ 

And that is when Arthur goes to the police, he doesn’t know what else to do. Fear of losing the woman he loves is too much, and as he explains a years worth of problems. The ugly truth slowly reveals itself.

So, in I go with the vacuum cleaner to get all of the bits of coffee bean out that have got lost between the feed and the grinder, which is what I normally do, but then I gave the nut that holds the burrs in place a bit of a twist, and realised I could undo it without using a spanner.

""Hmmm..."" I thought. ""I could probably take the burrs out and get rid of all the built up residue from underneath.""

So I did. Burrs came out, then I started vacuuming up the stuff that I can't normally reach. Then the ""grinder fan"" got sucked up towards the vacuum. ""That's useful,"" I thought again. ""I couldn't get that out with just my hands.""

So I pull it out and start vacuuming the inside of the grinder chamber. And boy was there a lot of gunk that had built up in there.

Great! Grinder cleaned, let's put it back together and grind some beans to dial it in.

This was the first indication that something had gone wrong. The grinds came out maybe pour-over course. Definitely not the soft and pillowy of espresso fine.

I adjusted the grind by a lot, but it still came out the same.

I looked up the cleaning instructions. There's apparently a felt washer in there that holds the inner burrs in place. There are also two other washers - top and bottom of the inner burrs - that seemed to have gone walkies. (I'm actually not sure where the upper one was. I might have dropped it on the floor or something, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't there when I reassembled everything.)

I cut open the vacuum bag. The felt washer was in there - torn apart and filled with dust.

I've now spent £20 getting a new set of washers - 2 simple steel washers, 1 tiny piece of felt - because I didn't think to look up the assembly instructions before going at it with a vacuum. Yay.

I am a professionally trained idiot - unfortunately not professionally trained in coffee machine maintenance - don't do what I did. Now I'm espresso-less for two days while I wait for the parts to arrive.",17,1766064642.0,JamesHoffmann,1,0.9,False

This was an early Christmas gift from the hubby and I was SO EXCITED! It was a “Used- like new” item from Amazon given that they were practically sold out. However, I noticed from the very first pull, the puck was extremely watery and there was about half of the amount of grounds in the puck than I’m used to seeing. Almost as if it wasn’t grinding enough or tamping it down properly before pulling. 

The “double shot” puck is slightly better but ultimately comes out watery because it’s dispensing enough water for a double shot and only grinding enough coffee for a single. 

We are not a family that usually splurges on big ticket items like this and I will feel horrible if I have to ask my hubby to replace it.

This happened while biking and exercising, and I was constantly exhausted, often falling asleep during classes despite trying to stay awake.

Nowadays, it affects everyday life. Walking up stairs or working with my arms above shoulder height makes my muscles feel like they have no energy, forcing me to rest. Even at work this physically holds me back after screwing above my head, I often need to lower my arms for a few seconds before I can continue.

When I wake up, my back and abdomen area feel quickly fatigued and sore, often with a mild feeling of breath hunger or oxygen shortage.

I also have frequent muscle twitches. People notice that I sigh sometimes and think I’m irritated, but I feel like I’m just trying to get enough air.

I struggle heavily with concentration at work, to the point where colleagues notice it. Coffee helps somewhat. I fall asleep suddenly during meetings, lessons, or while using public transport, even in noisy environments. It comes on abruptly. I’ve also had derealisation since primary school.

At some point, I became afraid I had a muscle or neuromuscular disease. After seeing many doctors, I was referred to the hospital. EMGs of my limbs, respiratory tests, and extensive blood work all came back normal.

Recently, I was tested for chronic hyperventilation and scored 100% on all parts; my carbon dioxide levels were clearly too low. This surprised me, as I never noticed myself hyperventilating. I’ve always known I have social anxiety, sometimes severe, but I never expected it to impact my physical health this much, especially during moments where I find myself in my safe space, at home or somewhere with less stimuli.

I’m still unsure whether all of this can be explained by chronic hyperventilation. At the same time, I’m at least somewhat relieved, and even a bit glad that there is finally something that has been diagnosed.

Hearing from others with similar experiences would really help. Also second opinions/ideas to improve my health are welcome.",1,1766064249.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

From there, we wander into one of Bangalore’s greener corners or stumble through a colorful market, just soaking in the chaos or calm, depending on the mood. When our feet (or attention spans) give out, we settle into a cozy café for coffee, or maybe cool off with ice cream that feels way too indulgent for the weather. 

And if the conversation’s still flowing, who knows—maybe a spontaneous detour to a bookshop rounds off the day just right.

About me:

26, tech guy, semi-professional overthinker, full-time curious soul. I like swimming, spontaneous treks, and exploring cafés that look like they were built for rainy days and long chats. On weekends, I alternate between doing absolutely nothing and everything at once.

P.S. Whoever’s late buys dessert. No debates. ",1,1766064242.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

```

You thought spectrum mode was just pretty graphs.  
Staring at colored lobes. Watching channels breathe.  
A visualization tool for the passive observer.

**Wrong.**

The spectrum analyzer grew fangs.

Select a network. Press Enter. Watch it bleed clients.  
Every phone, every laptop, every IoT toaster - exposed.  
MAC addresses. Vendors. Signal strength. Time since last packet.  
And arrows. Beautiful, terrifying arrows.

```
    >>  means they're getting closer.
    <<  means they're walking away.
```

Walk around. Watch the arrows change.  
Find the phone. Deauth the phone. Repeat.

The hunter becomes the hunted? No.  
The pig becomes the hunter. That's it. That's the feature.

---

## --[ Stability Status

Remember the horse on ketamine? It found meditation.  
The pig that got high at Taco Bell? It joined CrossFit.

We're in a good place now. Mostly.

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Stage | PRE-PRODUCTION / EXPERIMENTAL |
| Crashes | Zero. The streak lives. |
| Data Loss Risk | Low (XP in NVS, data on SD) |
| Memory Leaks | Plugged. Finally learned flush() |
| Production Ready | Closer. Still not there. |

The client monitor captures data frames at 30fps.  
The OUI lookup runs once per client, not 120 times per second.  
Someone learned about caching. It only took six versions.

New bugs are hiding. They always are.  
But these ones are polite. They wait for edge cases.

**github.com/0ct0sec/M5PORKCHOP/issues** - The confessional is open.

---

## --[ What's New in 0.1.6

**CLIENT MONITOR.** The big one. The reason you're updating.

HOG ON SPECTRUM wasn't finished. It was a visualization.  
Now it's a weapon. A hunting tool. A client finder.

Select network. Press Enter. See who's connected.  
Press Enter again. Deauth them. Watch them reconnect.  
Follow the signal. Find the device. Repeat.

The pig can track devices in real time.  
The pig knows which way they're moving.  
The pig has opinions about their vendor choices.

*This is fine.*

---

## --[ CLIENT MONITOR Deep Dive

You're in SPECTRUM mode. You see networks. Pretty lobes.  
One catches your eye. Strong signal. WPA2. No PMF.  
Vulnerable. Delicious.

Press Enter.

The screen changes. Channel locks. The hunt begins.

```
    +------------------------------------------+
    | CLIENTS: CoffeeShop_5G CH6               |
    +------------------------------------------+
    | 1.Apple    A3:F2 -55dB  3s >>            |
    | 2.Samsung  B1:C4 -68dB  1s >             |
    | 3.Random   D5:E6 -72dB  2s ==            |
    | 4.Xiaomi   F7:89 -85dB  4s <<            |
    +------------------------------------------+
```

**What you're seeing:**

- Client number and vendor (OUI database, 450+ entries)
- Last two octets of MAC (enough to identify)
- Signal strength in dBm (lower = farther from YOU)
- Time since last packet (freshness indicator)
- Proximity arrows (the money feature)

**The arrows tell you everything:**

| Arrow | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `>>` | Much closer to you than the router (+10dB or more) |
| `>` | Closer to you (+3 to +10dB) |
| `==` | About the same distance (-3 to +3dB) |
| `<` | Farther from you (-3 to -10dB) |
| `<<` | Much farther than the router (-10dB or more) |

Walk around. The arrows update in real time.  
When `>>` appears, you're getting hot.  
When `<<` appears, wrong direction.

Marco Polo, but for WiFi. And less fun for the target.

### ----[ Client Monitor Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `[;]` | Navigate up through client list |
| `[.]` | Navigate down through client list |
| `[Enter]` | DEAUTH selected client (5 frames each way) |
| `[B]` | Add network to BOAR BROS and exit |
| `` [`] `` | Exit to spectrum view |
| `[Bksp]` | Exit to spectrum view |

That Enter key does work. Real work.  
5 deauth frames AP→Client. 5 more Client→AP.  
1-5ms random jitter between each. Low thump sound.  
Brief toast: `""DEAUTH XX:XX x5""`

Spam Enter for continuous deauth. That's your trigger.  
The keyboard debounce is ~300ms. That's your fire rate.  
10 targeted deauths per second if you've got the fingers.

---

### ----[ The ""Random"" Vendor

You'll see it. A lot. Every modern phone does it.

MAC address randomization. Privacy feature.  
The first octet has the local-admin bit set.  
No OUI lookup possible. The MAC is fabricated.

We label these `""Random""` in the vendor field.  
Not Unknown. Not Error. **Random.**

It means someone cares about their privacy.  
It also means we can't fingerprint the hardware.  
We can still deauth it though. Privacy doesn't help there.

---

### ----[ Signal Loss Detection

The pig watches for activity. If no packets arrive for 15 seconds, something's wrong:

- Network went down
- Client left range
- Someone else deauthed it first (rude)
- You walked too far

The pig exits gracefully. Descending beep sequence.  
`""SIGNAL LOST""` toast. Back to spectrum view.

No hanging. No stale data. Clean exit. Professional.

---

### ----[ Sound Feedback

Ears work too. The pig talks back.

| Event | Freq | Length | Meaning |
|-------|------|--------|---------|
| Enter client monitor | 700Hz | 80ms | Channel locked |
| New client detected | 1200Hz | 100ms | Fresh meat |
| Deauth sent | 600Hz | 80ms | Low thump |
| Signal lost | 800→500Hz | - | Descending exit |

Sound enabled in Settings. You know where.  
First 4 clients get beeps. After that, quiet.  
We're hunting, not DJing.

---

## --[ OINK Mode Improvements

The attack machine got meaner. More surgical. Less wasteful.

### ----[ Broadcast Disassoc

Broadcast deauth now includes broadcast disassoc.  
Same target. Same timing. Different frame type.  
Some devices ignore deauth but respond to disassoc.

```
    Before: 1 broadcast deauth per cycle
    After:  1 broadcast deauth + 1 broadcast disassoc
```

Cost: 1 extra 26-byte frame per 100ms. Negligible.  
Benefit: Edge-case devices that only respond to disassoc.

### ----[ Deauth Jitter Tuning

The timing between frames was too predictable.  
WIDS systems love predictable. We don't love WIDS.

Random jitter now 1-5ms between each frame in burst.  
Forward deauth. Jitter. Reverse deauth. Jitter.  
Looks more organic. Feels more organic. Isn't.

Still machine-gun fast. Just less machine-gun obvious.

### ----[ Client Discovery Window

Lock time increased. 3 seconds wasn't enough.  
Slow clients missed the party. Fast clients hogged it.

Now 4 seconds. Class buff stacks to 4.2s at R0GU3.  
More time to catch probe responses. More clients to deauth.  
Quality over quantity. But also more quantity.

**The pig casts a wider net. And holds it longer.**

---

## --[ Navigation Improvements

Backtick finally makes sense.

```
    Before: Backtick always opened MENU. From anywhere.
    After:  Backtick means ""back one level.""
```

| From | Backtick Goes To |
|------|------------------|
| OINK mode | IDLE |
| WARHOG mode | IDLE |
| PIGGYBLUES mode | IDLE |
| SPECTRUM mode | IDLE |
| Client monitor | Spectrum view |
| IDLE | MENU |
| MENU/Settings | Parent menu |

Intuitive navigation. Only took six versions.  
Backspace still works too. We're not removing shortcuts.

---

## --[ Performance Optimizations

The pig got faster. Or rather, stopped being wasteful.

### ----[ OUI Lookup Caching

```
    Before: OUI lookup every frame. 4 clients x 30fps = 120/sec.
    After:  OUI lookup once per client. At discovery. Cached.
```

The vendor string is stored in the client struct.  
Never looked up again. 99.9% reduction in OUI overhead.

Binary search through 450 entries? Once.  
Pointer dereference? Every frame.  
That's how caching works. Finally learned.

### ----[ Data Frame Capture

The promiscuous filter was set wrong.  
Management frames only. No data frames.  
Client monitor couldn't see clients. Brilliant.

**Fixed:** `esp_wifi_set_promiscuous_filter(nullptr)`  
Now captures everything. As intended. As documented.  
Reading documentation is a feature, not a bug.

### ----[ Frame Control Parsing

ToDS and FromDS flags were read from the wrong byte.  
`payload[0]` instead of `payload[1]`. Off by one.  
Classic. Timeless. Fixed.

The pig now correctly identifies which direction data frames are traveling. Clients properly tracked.

---

## --[ THE PIG SPEAKS LOUDER NOW

You squinted. We noticed.

All network names are now **UPPERCASE** on display.  
OINK mode. SPECTRUM mode. Client monitor. LOOT menu.  
BOAR BROS. PWNED banner. Everywhere text matters.

```
    Before: ""linksys_guest_5g""
    After:  ""LINKSYS_GUEST_5G""
```

Your eyeballs thank us. Your optometrist hates us.  
The 240x135 display is small. The text is now loud.

File exports unchanged. WiGLE, CSV, .22000 files  
keep original case. Data integrity matters.  
Display readability also matters. We chose both.

Settings menu? Still lowercase. You need to squint there.  
Increased bloodflow to the prefrontal cortex.  
Helps you understand what you're actually configuring.  
We're looking out for your cognitive function.

The pig learned to yell.

---

## --[ The OUI Database

450+ vendor prefixes. All in PROGMEM. Zero RAM cost.

Apple, Samsung, Google, Intel, Cisco, Ubiquiti, TP-Link,  
Netgear, Asus, D-Link, Huawei, Xiaomi, OnePlus, Motorola,  
LG, Sony, Microsoft, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Amazon (Ring/Echo),  
Nest, Roku, Sonos, and 400 more you've never heard of.

Plus randomized MAC detection. Local-admin bit check.  
If they're hiding, we label them `""Random""`.

The database isn't exhaustive. IEEE has millions.  
But it covers everything you'll see in the wild.  
Unknown vendor? Still shows the MAC. Still deauthable.

## --[ IMMORTAL PIG (XP Persistence)

The grind was fragile. NVS wipe = back to BACON N00B.  
M5 Burner users learned this the hard way. We heard the screams.

**Not anymore.**

Your XP now backs up to SD card. Automatically. Every save.  
M5 Burner nukes your flash? Pig remembers. Recovers on boot.  
Full chip erase? Pig remembers. It's all on the SD.

```
    NVS = Primary storage (fast, survives firmware updates)
    SD  = Backup storage (survives everything else)
```

Once v0.1.6 boots with SD card present, you're protected.  
Update however you want after that. The pig is immortal.

### ----[ The Catch (There's Always A Catch)

We respect hackers. We made a hacker tool.  
So we made the backup device-bound and signed.

**What this means:**

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Edit XP values in hex editor | Signature invalid. LV1. |
| Copy save to different device | Signature invalid. LV1. |
| Download someone's save file | Signature invalid. LV1. |
| Corrupt the file | Validation fails. LV1. |
| Use legitimately on your device | Welcome back, warrior. |

**Want to tamper? Go ahead. It's a hacker tool.**  
**The source is public. Figure it out.**  
**We respect the attempt.**

But if you fail - you start over. BACON N00B. No exceptions.

Earn your rank. Or crack the signature.  
Either way, you've learned something.

*Your progression. Your responsibility. Your challenge.*

## --[ Installation - Maybe NOT Same As Always

1. Got M5 Launcher? Skip to step 3.
2. No Launcher? Flash it once via M5 Burner.
3. Grab `firmware.bin` from GitHub releases:  
   **https://github.com/0ct0sec/M5PORKCHOP/releases**
4. Drop on SD card. Launcher → SD → install.
5. Oink. Then hunt. Then question your ethics.

**Updating from 0.1.5?** Same process.  
XP preserved. Settings preserved. Hunting instincts optional.

**M5 Burner addict? Web flasher junkie? OTA enthusiast?**  
Cool. We don't judge your flashing preferences.

Here's the deal:

1. Install v0.1.6_iddqd via M5 Launcher ONCE. Just once.
2. Boot. Let the pig create its SD backup. Takes 2 seconds.
3. Now flash however you want. Burner. Web. Carrier pigeon.
4. The pig will recover from SD. Every. Single. Time.

That first Launcher install is your insurance policy.  
Skip it? Your XP goes to /dev/null. We warned you.  
Read the TL;DR at the top. We put it there for a reason.

*The immortal pig forgives your flash methods.*  
*But only after you let it backup first.*

---

## --[ Hardware

**Required:**
- M5Cardputer (ESP32-S3)
- SD card (for your data crimes)

**Required for wardriving:**
- AT6558 GPS module or compatible
- Legs (or wheels, or wings, zero judgment)

**Optional for maximum hunting:**
- Comfortable shoes (you'll be walking)
- Poker face (when the arrows point at someone)
- Plausible deniability (for later)

---

## --[ Hunting Ethics (A Brief Moment of Seriousness)

The client monitor can find devices.  
The deauth feature can disconnect them.  
The proximity arrows can track movement.

**This is powerful. This is concerning. This is intentional.**

**Use it for:**
- Security auditing YOUR networks
- Authorized penetration testing
- Educational purposes
- Understanding WiFi at a deeper level

**Don't use it for:**
- Stalking people
- Harassing strangers
- Being a creep
- Anything that gets you arrested

The pig doesn't judge. The law does.  
We made a hunting tool. Hunt responsibly.

## --[ Credits

```
    Developed by: 0ct0
    Fueled by:    Whatever keeps the commits flowing
    Team size:    Still 1
```

The 3am commits continue.  
The feature creep is real.  
The pig grows more capable with each version.

Solo dev. No standup. No JIRA. No code review.  
Just a person, a pig, and an unhealthy relationship  
with promiscuous mode WiFi frames.

Contributors still welcome.  
The pig needs features.  
The pig's creator needs perspective.  
Both are accepting pull requests.

---

## --[ Support The Pig

This project runs on:
- Caffeine (IV drip preferred)
- Sleep deprivation (chronic)
- The knowledge that someone, somewhere, is hunting clients with a cartoon pig

If PORKCHOP helped you find a rogue device,  
understand your network better,  
or just made you smile at the absurdity of it all -  
consider funding the next 3am debug session:

**https://buymeacoffee.com/0ct0**

Your coffee becomes my code.  
My code becomes your hunting tool.  
Your hunting tool becomes someone's bad day.

*The ecosystem is weird. But it works.*

---

## --[ Legal

**Educational and authorized security research ONLY.**

Client monitoring is a capability, not a right.  
Deauthing devices you don't own is a crime.  
Tracking people without consent is stalking.

We made a pig that can hunt WiFi clients.  
The pig is a tool. Tools don't make choices.  
You do. Make good ones.

**Don't be stupid. Don't be evil.**  
**Don't make us regret publishing this.**

---

## --[ Transmission Notes

*This phile drops from a surprise branch.*  
*Stashed under the coat. Hidden from the backlog.*  
*The kind of commit you make when the feature*  
*grabs you by the collar and won't let go.*

The pig is stable. The horse found yoga.  
The dev is taking a short breather. PTO exists for a reason.

Back soon. Features are already brewing.  
The backlog grows while the batteries recharge.

See you in the next phile. Same pig, same channel.  
The oinking never stops for long.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Unfortunately, I've noticed a problem with the pressure, which consistently jumps to 14 bar and then settles at 12 bar after 4 seconds. This makes a big difference, as I don't have a consistent pressure, and I'm constantly wondering how I can preset the machine to 9 bar so that everything is more reproducible and quicker to adjust with new beans.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Below is a breakdown of the 8 key components that make a prompt successful, followed by a universal template and 10 copy-paste examples applied to various industries (Luxury, Tech, Food, etc.).

These prompts work exceptionally well with **Midjourney v6 and Stable Diffusion XL.**

# 

The Formula: 8 Key Components To create a reusable template, ensure your prompt covers these layers:

**Style & Photography:** (e.g., Ultra-realistic 8K, Minimalist studio shot).

**Subject & Action:** (What is it and what is it doing?).

**Environment:** (Marble surface, neon city, rustic table).

**Lighting:** (Golden hour, soft key light, dramatic shadows).

**Details:** (Micro-scratches, steam, dust particles). Mood: (Luxurious, cozy, high-tech).

**Camera Gear:** (100mm macro, f/2.8 aperture). Tech Specs: (--ar 16:9, --v 6.0).

The Case Studies (Copy & Paste) Here is how this template applies to 10 different products.

1. Luxury Watch Focus: Precision, metals, and elegance.

&#8203;

    Ultra-realistic 8K product photography of an elegant Chrono-Master 7 watch. Crafted from polished rose gold, with a deep navy blue dial featuring intricate subdials. The second hand is captured mid-sweep to imply motion. Placed on a dark, veined marble surface. The background is a soft-focus, out-of-focus library with warm wooden shelves. A single, soft key light from the side highlights the watch’s metallic texture, creating subtle, elegant reflections and long, soft shadows. Microscopic details of the brushed metal finish, the texture of the alligator leather strap, and the anti-reflective coating on the sapphire crystal are visible. The scene has a luxurious, timeless, and sophisticated aesthetic. Shot with a 105mm macro lens at f/2.2, creating a beautiful bokeh. ISO 100 for maximum clarity --ar 16:9

2. Organic Coffee
Focus: Warmth, texture, and authenticity.

    Warm, inviting 4K lifestyle photography of 'Morning Sun' organic coffee beans. A handful of rich, dark-roasted arabica beans, glistening with natural oils, spilling from a rustic burlap sack. Placed on a weathered, reclaimed wood table next to a steaming ceramic mug. The background shows a blurry kitchen scene with morning sunlight streaming through the window. Warm, golden hour morning light illuminates the scene, catching the steam rising from the mug and highlighting the texture of the beans. The coarse texture of the burlap, the cracks in the wooden table, and the oily sheen on individual coffee beans are clearly visible. Rustic, cozy, and authentic aesthetic. Shot with a 50mm prime lens at f/1.8 --ar 16:9

3. High-Speed Drone
Focus: Motion, speed, and sleek tech.

    Dynamic 4K aerial photography of a high-speed drone in flight. The drone is shown racing through a clear blue sky, with its propellers blurred by motion. The drone soars over a futuristic cityscape, with the skyline in the background. Bright sunlight creates sharp contrasts and highlights the drone’s sleek design. Detailed views of the rotor blades and carbon-fiber body. The scene has an energetic, adventurous, and high-tech aesthetic. Shot with a wide-angle lens at f/4 for clear focus on the drone and background --ar 16:9

https://preview.redd.it/w556flf8oy7g1.png?width=2752&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c1c00f78b0fa58907461da996f773deaa91570

4. Modern Smartphone
Focus: Minimalism, screen quality, and clean lines

    Minimalist 4K product photography of a sleek new smartphone. The phone features a full-screen display and cutting-edge technology, shown in the hand of a user. Placed on a clean, white desk with a blurred workspace background. Soft, diffused lighting enhances the phone’s screen clarity and metallic edges. Visible textures of the matte back, subtle fingerprints on the screen, and light reflections. Modern, clean, and innovative mood. Shot with a 50mm lens at f/2.2 --ar 1:1

https://preview.redd.it/uq6b68tloy7g1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c71cdca1f456f49dacb5d27903747c18d68fe0b

5. Futuristic Smart Glasses
Focus: Glow effects, transparency, and innovation.

    Futuristic 8K product photography of smart glasses. The smart glasses feature a sleek, frameless design with translucent lenses that glow in the dark. Placed on a polished wooden desk with a blurred tech-themed background. Soft, diffused light from above emphasizes the lenses' glow. Close-up view of the glowing edges and high-tech surface. Sleek, innovative, and futuristic aesthetic. Shot with a 85mm lens at f/1.8 for a dreamy bokeh effect --ar 16:9

**Conclusion**

​The secret isn't just describing the object, but describing the camera lens and the light. Feel free to use these as a base and swap out the subjects!

1ppqghh,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ppqghh/hr_one_more_breath/,[HR] One more Breath,"I remember the exact moment I realized God had left us.

Not in some grand, biblical way. No thunderclap, no burning bush going dark. Just a quiet thing. 

I was in the kitchen making coffee, and the radio preacher who’d been on every morning for twenty years suddenly went silent mid-sentence. Not static. Not dead air. Simply… nothing. 

Like someone had pulled the plug on the universe’s background noise.

That was Day One.

They called the sickness “the Reaping” later, while people still had the strength to name things. It started small. A dry cough here, a little shortness of breath there. Doctors blamed pollution, then a new virus, then mass psychosomatic hysteria when the tests came back clean. But we knew. Deep down, we all knew.

By week three, the sky had changed. Not dramatically, no blood-red apocalypse or anything cinematic. It just dulled. Like someone turned down the saturation on the world. The blue leached out of it until everything above us was the color of old dishwater. Sunrises stopped being beautiful. They became reminders.

I watched my wife, Mara, go first. She was always the healthy one. Ran marathons, ate kale like it was candy. She used to laugh at me when I got winded by climbing the stairs. But one morning, she woke up and couldn’t catch her breath. Not dramatically gasping, just breathing like she was stuck underwater. Shallow little sips of air that never quite filled her lungs.

The hospitals were already overflowing. People lined up outside in the gray light, coughing into their elbows, eyes wide with the same realization I’d had listening to that silent radio. God wasn’t coming.

Mara lasted six weeks. Toward the end, she completely stopped talking. Just laid in our bed staring at the ceiling, taking those tiny, careful breaths. The last thing she said to me was two days before she slipped away.

“Do you think He’s watching?”

I didn’t know how to answer. I still don’t.

After she was gone, I tried to keep routines. Went to the store even though the shelves were mostly bare. Passed people on the street who looked like ghosts already. Skin grayish, eyes sunken, moving slowly like every step cost them something precious. Nobody looted anymore. What was the point? We were all dying at different speeds.

There was this guy in our neighborhood, Mr. Halvorsen, an old Norwegian widower who’d always been devout. He attended church every Sunday without fail. After the Reaping hit, he started standing on his porch at dawn, arms raised to that washed-out sky, praying in this loud, ragged voice.

At first people joined him. 

 Then fewer. 

 Then none.

I found him one morning sitting on his steps, staring at nothing. His Bible was open on his lap, pages fluttering in the wind that somehow still blew even though everything else felt still.

“He’s not listening,” 

He told me without looking up. 

“I’ve been calling for months. Nothing but echo.”

He died that afternoon. Just sat there until he didn’t breathe anymore.

Sometimes at night I’d hear screaming from other houses. Not pain exactly, more like realization. That moment when someone finally accepted what was happening. Those screams got quieter as time passed. Either people stopped fighting it, or there just weren’t enough of us left to make noise.

I kept a journal for a while. Thought maybe someone would find it someday; just maybe someone would know we’d been here. But the pen got heavy. The words got heavy. Eventually I stopped. 

Now I’m in what used to be our living room. The couch is gone; I burned it for warmth last winter, but I’ve got blankets piled on the floor. The air tastes metallic. Every breath feels like dragging sand into my lungs.

It’s getting harder to remember things clearly. Faces blur. Was Mara’s hair brown or blonde? Did we have a dog once, or am I thinking of someone else’s life?

The sky outside the window is the same color it’s been for years now. That endless gray. No birds anymore. No planes. Just quiet.I used to be angry. Screamed at the ceiling until my throat bled. Begged. Bargained. Threatened, even. But anger takes energy, and energy is something I don’t have in reserve anymore.

These days I mostly think about small things. The way coffee smelled on Sunday mornings. How Mara used to hum while doing dishes. The sound of rain on the roof that one summer we fixed the gutters together. Funny what matters when everything’s ending.

My chest is tight now. Like there’s a fist inside squeezing slower and slower. Each breath is a little shallower than the last. I can hear it. This wet rattle started a few days ago.It won’t be long.Part of me wants to fight it. To drag in one more lungful, just to prove something. But what would I be proving? That I can delay the inevitable by thirty seconds?The other part, the bigger part now, is tired. So fucking tired.

I think maybe Mara was right to ask if he's watching. Maybe He is. Maybe this is the point. Not punishment, not judgment. Only observation. Seeing what we do when we know nobody’s coming to save us.Or maybe there never was anyone there at all.Either way, the result’s the same.The light’s getting dimmer. Or maybe that’s my eyes. Hard to tell anymore.

If you’re reading this, if anyone ever reads this, please know that we tried. Some of us prayed. Some of us raged. Some of us just held each other until we couldn’t anymore.

 We were here.

 We loved things.

 We were scared, and now we’re going quiet.

The fist in my chest squeezes again. shorter this time.It’s peaceful, almost.Like falling asleep after the longest day of your life.

One more breath.

Just one more.",1,1766063507.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

+=========================================================================+
```

You thought spectrum mode was just pretty graphs.  
Staring at colored lobes. Watching channels breathe.  
A visualization tool for the passive observer.

**Wrong.**

The spectrum analyzer grew fangs.

Select a network. Press Enter. Watch it bleed clients.  
Every phone, every laptop, every IoT toaster - exposed.  
MAC addresses. Vendors. Signal strength. Time since last packet.  
And arrows. Beautiful, terrifying arrows.

```
    >>  means they're getting closer.
    <<  means they're walking away.
```

Walk around. Watch the arrows change.  
Find the phone. Deauth the phone. Repeat.

The hunter becomes the hunted? No.  
The pig becomes the hunter. That's it. That's the feature.

## --[ Stability Status

Remember the horse on ketamine? It found meditation.  
The pig that got high at Taco Bell? It joined CrossFit.

We're in a good place now. Mostly.

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Stage | PRE-PRODUCTION / EXPERIMENTAL |
| Crashes | Zero. The streak lives. |
| Data Loss Risk | Low (XP in NVS, data on SD) |
| Memory Leaks | Plugged. Finally learned flush() |
| Production Ready | Closer. Still not there. |

The client monitor captures data frames at 30fps.  
The OUI lookup runs once per client, not 120 times per second.  
Someone learned about caching. It only took six versions.

New bugs are hiding. They always are.  
But these ones are polite. They wait for edge cases.

**github.com/0ct0sec/M5PORKCHOP/issues** - The confessional is open.

---

## --[ What's New in 0.1.6

**CLIENT MONITOR.** The big one. The reason you're updating.

HOG ON SPECTRUM wasn't finished. It was a visualization.  
Now it's a weapon. A hunting tool. A client finder.

Select network. Press Enter. See who's connected.  
Press Enter again. Deauth them. Watch them reconnect.  
Follow the signal. Find the device. Repeat.

The pig can track devices in real time.  
The pig knows which way they're moving.  
The pig has opinions about their vendor choices.

*This is fine.*

---

## --[ CLIENT MONITOR Deep Dive

You're in SPECTRUM mode. You see networks. Pretty lobes.  
One catches your eye. Strong signal. WPA2. No PMF.  
Vulnerable. Delicious.

Press Enter.

The screen changes. Channel locks. The hunt begins.

```
    +------------------------------------------+
    | CLIENTS: CoffeeShop_5G CH6               |
    +------------------------------------------+
    | 1.Apple    A3:F2 -55dB  3s >>            |
    | 2.Samsung  B1:C4 -68dB  1s >             |
    | 3.Random   D5:E6 -72dB  2s ==            |
    | 4.Xiaomi   F7:89 -85dB  4s <<            |
    +------------------------------------------+
```

**What you're seeing:**

- Client number and vendor (OUI database, 450+ entries)
- Last two octets of MAC (enough to identify)
- Signal strength in dBm (lower = farther from YOU)
- Time since last packet (freshness indicator)
- Proximity arrows (the money feature)

**The arrows tell you everything:**

| Arrow | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `>>` | Much closer to you than the router (+10dB or more) |
| `>` | Closer to you (+3 to +10dB) |
| `==` | About the same distance (-3 to +3dB) |
| `<` | Farther from you (-3 to -10dB) |
| `<<` | Much farther than the router (-10dB or more) |

Walk around. The arrows update in real time.  
When `>>` appears, you're getting hot.  
When `<<` appears, wrong direction.

Marco Polo, but for WiFi. And less fun for the target.

### ----[ Client Monitor Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `[;]` | Navigate up through client list |
| `[.]` | Navigate down through client list |
| `[Enter]` | DEAUTH selected client (5 frames each way) |
| `[B]` | Add network to BOAR BROS and exit |
| `` [`] `` | Exit to spectrum view |
| `[Bksp]` | Exit to spectrum view |

That Enter key does work. Real work.  
5 deauth frames AP→Client. 5 more Client→AP.  
1-5ms random jitter between each. Low thump sound.  
Brief toast: `""DEAUTH XX:XX x5""`

Spam Enter for continuous deauth. That's your trigger.  
The keyboard debounce is ~300ms. That's your fire rate.  
10 targeted deauths per second if you've got the fingers.

---

### ----[ The ""Random"" Vendor

You'll see it. A lot. Every modern phone does it.

MAC address randomization. Privacy feature.  
The first octet has the local-admin bit set.  
No OUI lookup possible. The MAC is fabricated.

We label these `""Random""` in the vendor field.  
Not Unknown. Not Error. **Random.**

It means someone cares about their privacy.  
It also means we can't fingerprint the hardware.  
We can still deauth it though. Privacy doesn't help there.

---

### ----[ Signal Loss Detection

The pig watches for activity. If no packets arrive for 15 seconds, something's wrong:

- Network went down
- Client left range
- Someone else deauthed it first (rude)
- You walked too far

The pig exits gracefully. Descending beep sequence.  
`""SIGNAL LOST""` toast. Back to spectrum view.

No hanging. No stale data. Clean exit. Professional.

---

### ----[ Sound Feedback

Ears work too. The pig talks back.

| Event | Freq | Length | Meaning |
|-------|------|--------|---------|
| Enter client monitor | 700Hz | 80ms | Channel locked |
| New client detected | 1200Hz | 100ms | Fresh meat |
| Deauth sent | 600Hz | 80ms | Low thump |
| Signal lost | 800→500Hz | - | Descending exit |

Sound enabled in Settings. You know where.  
First 4 clients get beeps. After that, quiet.  
We're hunting, not DJing.

---

## --[ OINK Mode Improvements

The attack machine got meaner. More surgical. Less wasteful.

### ----[ Broadcast Disassoc

Broadcast deauth now includes broadcast disassoc.  
Same target. Same timing. Different frame type.  
Some devices ignore deauth but respond to disassoc.

```
    Before: 1 broadcast deauth per cycle
    After:  1 broadcast deauth + 1 broadcast disassoc
```

Cost: 1 extra 26-byte frame per 100ms. Negligible.  
Benefit: Edge-case devices that only respond to disassoc.

### ----[ Deauth Jitter Tuning

The timing between frames was too predictable.  
WIDS systems love predictable. We don't love WIDS.

Random jitter now 1-5ms between each frame in burst.  
Forward deauth. Jitter. Reverse deauth. Jitter.  
Looks more organic. Feels more organic. Isn't.

Still machine-gun fast. Just less machine-gun obvious.

### ----[ Client Discovery Window

Lock time increased. 3 seconds wasn't enough.  
Slow clients missed the party. Fast clients hogged it.

Now 4 seconds. Class buff stacks to 4.2s at R0GU3.  
More time to catch probe responses. More clients to deauth.  
Quality over quantity. But also more quantity.

**The pig casts a wider net. And holds it longer.**

---

## --[ Navigation Improvements

Backtick finally makes sense.

```
    Before: Backtick always opened MENU. From anywhere.
    After:  Backtick means ""back one level.""
```

| From | Backtick Goes To |
|------|------------------|
| OINK mode | IDLE |
| WARHOG mode | IDLE |
| PIGGYBLUES mode | IDLE |
| SPECTRUM mode | IDLE |
| Client monitor | Spectrum view |
| IDLE | MENU |
| MENU/Settings | Parent menu |

Intuitive navigation. Only took six versions.  
Backspace still works too. We're not removing shortcuts.

---

## --[ Performance Optimizations

The pig got faster. Or rather, stopped being wasteful.

### ----[ OUI Lookup Caching

```
    Before: OUI lookup every frame. 4 clients x 30fps = 120/sec.
    After:  OUI lookup once per client. At discovery. Cached.
```

The vendor string is stored in the client struct.  
Never looked up again. 99.9% reduction in OUI overhead.

Binary search through 450 entries? Once.  
Pointer dereference? Every frame.  
That's how caching works. Finally learned.

### ----[ Data Frame Capture

The promiscuous filter was set wrong.  
Management frames only. No data frames.  
Client monitor couldn't see clients. Brilliant.

**Fixed:** `esp_wifi_set_promiscuous_filter(nullptr)`  
Now captures everything. As intended. As documented.  
Reading documentation is a feature, not a bug.

### ----[ Frame Control Parsing

ToDS and FromDS flags were read from the wrong byte.  
`payload[0]` instead of `payload[1]`. Off by one.  
Classic. Timeless. Fixed.

The pig now correctly identifies which direction data frames are traveling. Clients properly tracked.

---

## --[ THE PIG SPEAKS LOUDER NOW

You squinted. We noticed.

All network names are now **UPPERCASE** on display.  
OINK mode. SPECTRUM mode. Client monitor. LOOT menu.  
BOAR BROS. PWNED banner. Everywhere text matters.

```
    Before: ""linksys_guest_5g""
    After:  ""LINKSYS_GUEST_5G""
```

Your eyeballs thank us. Your optometrist hates us.  
The 240x135 display is small. The text is now loud.

File exports unchanged. WiGLE, CSV, .22000 files  
keep original case. Data integrity matters.  
Display readability also matters. We chose both.

Settings menu? Still lowercase. You need to squint there.  
Increased bloodflow to the prefrontal cortex.  
Helps you understand what you're actually configuring.  
We're looking out for your cognitive function.

The pig learned to yell.

---

## --[ The OUI Database

450+ vendor prefixes. All in PROGMEM. Zero RAM cost.

Apple, Samsung, Google, Intel, Cisco, Ubiquiti, TP-Link,  
Netgear, Asus, D-Link, Huawei, Xiaomi, OnePlus, Motorola,  
LG, Sony, Microsoft, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Amazon (Ring/Echo),  
Nest, Roku, Sonos, and 400 more you've never heard of.

Plus randomized MAC detection. Local-admin bit check.  
If they're hiding, we label them `""Random""`.

The database isn't exhaustive. IEEE has millions.  
But it covers everything you'll see in the wild.  
Unknown vendor? Still shows the MAC. Still deauthable.

## --[ IMMORTAL PIG (XP Persistence)

The grind was fragile. NVS wipe = back to BACON N00B.  
M5 Burner users learned this the hard way. We heard the screams.

**Not anymore.**

Your XP now backs up to SD card. Automatically. Every save.  
M5 Burner nukes your flash? Pig remembers. Recovers on boot.  
Full chip erase? Pig remembers. It's all on the SD.

```
    NVS = Primary storage (fast, survives firmware updates)
    SD  = Backup storage (survives everything else)
```

Once v0.1.6 boots with SD card present, you're protected.  
Update however you want after that. The pig is immortal.

### ----[ The Catch (There's Always A Catch)

We respect hackers. We made a hacker tool.  
So we made the backup device-bound and signed.

**What this means:**

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Edit XP values in hex editor | Signature invalid. LV1. |
| Copy save to different device | Signature invalid. LV1. |
| Download someone's save file | Signature invalid. LV1. |
| Corrupt the file | Validation fails. LV1. |
| Use legitimately on your device | Welcome back, warrior. |

**Want to tamper? Go ahead. It's a hacker tool.**  
**The source is public. Figure it out.**  
**We respect the attempt.**

But if you fail - you start over. BACON N00B. No exceptions.

Earn your rank. Or crack the signature.  
Either way, you've learned something.

*Your progression. Your responsibility. Your challenge.*

## --[ Installation - Maybe NOT Same As Always

1. Got M5 Launcher? Skip to step 3.
2. No Launcher? Flash it once via M5 Burner.
3. Grab `firmware.bin` from GitHub releases:  
   **https://github.com/0ct0sec/M5PORKCHOP/releases**
4. Drop on SD card. Launcher → SD → install.
5. Oink. Then hunt. Then question your ethics.

**Updating from 0.1.5?** Same process.  
XP preserved. Settings preserved. Hunting instincts optional.

**M5 Burner addict? Web flasher junkie? OTA enthusiast?**  
Cool. We don't judge your flashing preferences.

Here's the deal:

1. Install v0.1.6_iddqd via M5 Launcher ONCE. Just once.
2. Boot. Let the pig create its SD backup. Takes 2 seconds.
3. Now flash however you want. Burner. Web. Carrier pigeon.
4. The pig will recover from SD. Every. Single. Time.

That first Launcher install is your insurance policy.  
Skip it? Your XP goes to /dev/null. We warned you.  
Read the TL;DR at the top. We put it there for a reason.

*The immortal pig forgives your flash methods.*  
*But only after you let it backup first.*

---

## --[ Hardware

**Required:**
- M5Cardputer (ESP32-S3)
- SD card (for your data crimes)

**Required for wardriving:**
- AT6558 GPS module or compatible
- Legs (or wheels, or wings, zero judgment)

**Optional for maximum hunting:**
- Comfortable shoes (you'll be walking)
- Poker face (when the arrows point at someone)
- Plausible deniability (for later)

---

## --[ Hunting Ethics (A Brief Moment of Seriousness)

The client monitor can find devices.  
The deauth feature can disconnect them.  
The proximity arrows can track movement.

**This is powerful. This is concerning. This is intentional.**

**Use it for:**
- Security auditing YOUR networks
- Authorized penetration testing
- Educational purposes
- Understanding WiFi at a deeper level

**Don't use it for:**
- Stalking people
- Harassing strangers
- Being a creep
- Anything that gets you arrested

The pig doesn't judge. The law does.  
We made a hunting tool. Hunt responsibly.

## --[ Credits

```
    Developed by: 0ct0
    Fueled by:    Whatever keeps the commits flowing
    Team size:    Still 1
```

The 3am commits continue.  
The feature creep is real.  
The pig grows more capable with each version.

Solo dev. No standup. No JIRA. No code review.  
Just a person, a pig, and an unhealthy relationship  
with promiscuous mode WiFi frames.

Contributors still welcome.  
The pig needs features.  
The pig's creator needs perspective.  
Both are accepting pull requests.

## --[ Support The Pig

This project runs on:
- Caffeine (IV drip preferred)
- Sleep deprivation (chronic)
- The knowledge that someone, somewhere, is hunting clients with a cartoon pig

If PORKCHOP helped you find a rogue device,  
understand your network better,  
or just made you smile at the absurdity of it all -  
consider funding the next 3am debug session:

**https://buymeacoffee.com/0ct0**

Your coffee becomes my code.  
My code becomes your hunting tool.  
Your hunting tool becomes someone's bad day.

*The ecosystem is weird. But it works.*

---

## --[ Legal

**Educational and authorized security research ONLY.**

Client monitoring is a capability, not a right.  
Deauthing devices you don't own is a crime.  
Tracking people without consent is stalking.

We made a pig that can hunt WiFi clients.  
The pig is a tool. Tools don't make choices.  
You do. Make good ones.

**Don't be stupid. Don't be evil.**  
**Don't make us regret publishing this.**

## --[ Transmission Notes

*This phile drops from a surprise branch.*  
*Stashed under the coat. Hidden from the backlog.*  
*The kind of commit you make when the feature*  
*grabs you by the collar and won't let go.*

The pig is stable. The horse found yoga.  
The dev is taking a short breather. PTO exists for a reason.

Back soon. Features are already brewing.  
The backlog grows while the batteries recharge.

See you in the next phile. Same pig, same channel.  
The oinking never stops for long.

When I use the k-cup feature, I make sure the container is filled with water. I then place the k-cup into the slot, make the coffee, wipe the drip/spray from process, open up slot and remove used k-cup and throw it away.. Leaving it ready for the next person. 

Apparently, most people just make the pod and then grab their copy and leave, leaving the next person to clean the last one up and do theirs. 

I am curious as to what you all do when you use a public work Keurig with k-cups.

1ppqe6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1ppqe6c/one_more_breath/,One more Breath,"I remember the exact moment I realized God had left us.

Not in some grand, biblical way. No thunderclap, no burning bush going dark. Just a quiet thing. 

I was in the kitchen making coffee, and the radio preacher who’d been on every morning for twenty years suddenly went silent mid-sentence. Not static. Not dead air. Simply… nothing. 

Like someone had pulled the plug on the universe’s background noise.

That was Day One.

They called the sickness “the Reaping” later, while people still had the strength to name things. It started small. A dry cough here, a little shortness of breath there. Doctors blamed pollution, then a new virus, then mass psychosomatic hysteria when the tests came back clean. But we knew. Deep down, we all knew.

By week three, the sky had changed. Not dramatically, no blood-red apocalypse or anything cinematic. It just dulled. Like someone turned down the saturation on the world. The blue leached out of it until everything above us was the color of old dishwater. Sunrises stopped being beautiful. They became reminders.

I watched my wife, Mara, go first. She was always the healthy one. Ran marathons, ate kale like it was candy. She used to laugh at me when I got winded by climbing the stairs. But one morning, she woke up and couldn’t catch her breath. Not dramatically gasping, just breathing like she was stuck underwater. Shallow little sips of air that never quite filled her lungs.

The hospitals were already overflowing. People lined up outside in the gray light, coughing into their elbows, eyes wide with the same realization I’d had listening to that silent radio. God wasn’t coming.

Mara lasted six weeks. Toward the end, she completely stopped talking. Just laid in our bed staring at the ceiling, taking those tiny, careful breaths. The last thing she said to me was two days before she slipped away.

“Do you think He’s watching?”

I didn’t know how to answer. I still don’t.

After she was gone, I tried to keep routines. Went to the store even though the shelves were mostly bare. Passed people on the street who looked like ghosts already. Skin grayish, eyes sunken, moving slowly like every step cost them something precious. Nobody looted anymore. What was the point? We were all dying at different speeds.

There was this guy in our neighborhood, Mr. Halvorsen, an old Norwegian widower who’d always been devout. He attended church every Sunday without fail. After the Reaping hit, he started standing on his porch at dawn, arms raised to that washed-out sky, praying in this loud, ragged voice.

At first people joined him. 

 Then fewer. 

 Then none.

I found him one morning sitting on his steps, staring at nothing. His Bible was open on his lap, pages fluttering in the wind that somehow still blew even though everything else felt still.

“He’s not listening,” 

He told me without looking up. 

“I’ve been calling for months. Nothing but echo.”

He died that afternoon. Just sat there until he didn’t breathe anymore.

Sometimes at night I’d hear screaming from other houses. Not pain exactly, more like realization. That moment when someone finally accepted what was happening. Those screams got quieter as time passed. Either people stopped fighting it, or there just weren’t enough of us left to make noise.

I kept a journal for a while. Thought maybe someone would find it someday; just maybe someone would know we’d been here. But the pen got heavy. The words got heavy. Eventually I stopped. 

Now I’m in what used to be our living room. The couch is gone; I burned it for warmth last winter, but I’ve got blankets piled on the floor. The air tastes metallic. Every breath feels like dragging sand into my lungs.

It’s getting harder to remember things clearly. Faces blur. Was Mara’s hair brown or blonde? Did we have a dog once, or am I thinking of someone else’s life?

The sky outside the window is the same color it’s been for years now. That endless gray. No birds anymore. No planes. Just quiet.I used to be angry. Screamed at the ceiling until my throat bled. Begged. Bargained. Threatened, even. But anger takes energy, and energy is something I don’t have in reserve anymore.

These days I mostly think about small things. The way coffee smelled on Sunday mornings. How Mara used to hum while doing dishes. The sound of rain on the roof that one summer we fixed the gutters together. Funny what matters when everything’s ending.

My chest is tight now. Like there’s a fist inside squeezing slower and slower. Each breath is a little shallower than the last. I can hear it. This wet rattle started a few days ago.It won’t be long.Part of me wants to fight it. To drag in one more lungful, just to prove something. But what would I be proving? That I can delay the inevitable by thirty seconds?The other part, the bigger part now, is tired. So fucking tired.

I think maybe Mara was right to ask if he's watching. Maybe He is. Maybe this is the point. Not punishment, not judgment. Only observation. Seeing what we do when we know nobody’s coming to save us.Or maybe there never was anyone there at all.Either way, the result’s the same.The light’s getting dimmer. Or maybe that’s my eyes. Hard to tell anymore.

If you’re reading this, if anyone ever reads this, please know that we tried. Some of us prayed. Some of us raged. Some of us just held each other until we couldn’t anymore.

 We were here.

 We loved things.

 We were scared, and now we’re going quiet.

The fist in my chest squeezes again. shorter this time.It’s peaceful, almost.Like falling asleep after the longest day of your life.

One more breath.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I tried to add some water to the orange juice, it’s better but not ideal

""I'm taking three days off.""  
  
  
I lay in bed, the C-section incision burning like fire.  
  
  
""For what?""  
  
  
My husband Charles didn't even glance at me, yanking his shoelaces tight. ""Vivian's moving. She needs help.""  
  
  
Vivian. His EX-WIFE.  
  
  
""I just had major surgery two weeks ago! Our baby is barely sleeping through the night!""  
  
  
""My mom's here. You'll be fine.""  
  
  
I tried to continue, but he'd already grabbed his car keys and headed for the door.  
  
  
""I'll be back in three days.""  
  
  
""Charles Miller!""  
  
  
The door slammed shut.  
  
  
My mother-in-law walked in with a mug of lactation tea. ""You know, Vivian's all alone now. You have me, you have the baby. Stop being so selfish.""  
  
  
My hands clenched the sheets.  
  
  
""Here."" She shoved the mug onto the nightstand. ""Just focus on your child. Stop complaining.""  
  
  
I stared at her, then at the door.  
  
  
""So I and our newborn come second to his ex-wife's moving day?""  
  
  
I pushed myself up, ignoring the pain ripping through my abdomen.  
  
  
""Then what the hell do I need him for? He can go be with her. I'm DONE!""  
  
  
I stared at the mug of lactation tea. Hadn't touched it.  
  
  
My mother-in-law had already retreated to the living room, TV blaring. The Maury Povich Show—her favorite.  
  
  
The baby slept beside me, face still wrinkled and red. He's only fifteen days old.  
  
  
My C-section incision hadn't even been cleared by the doctor yet.  
  
  
Last night, the baby cried four times. I nursed four times. Charles slept through it all in the guest room—said he needed rest for work.  
  
  
This morning, he got dressed like he was going to a business meeting. Said he was taking time off.  
  
  
For a second, I thought he'd finally remembered—oh right, I have a wife who just had surgery and a newborn.  
  
  
Nope. He was helping his EX-WIFE move.  
  
  
Vivian. I'd been hearing that name for three years.  
  
  
Before we got married, Charles said they ""ended things amicably."" No drama.  
  
  
After we got married? Turns out ""no drama"" actually meant \*\*he's still in love with her.  
  
  
Vivian's car broke down? Charles fixed it.  
  
  
Vivian's laptop crashed? Charles drove over.  
  
  
Vivian's lightbulb went out? Charles changed it.  
  
  
Every time I said I wasn't feeling well, he'd say: ""She's a woman living alone. She has no one.""  
  
  
I'd say: ""I'm a woman too.""  
  
  
He'd say: ""You have my mom.""  
  
  
I glanced toward the living room. My mother-in-law was eating fried chicken, laughing at the TV.  
  
  
I picked up my phone. Opened Instagram. Charles's latest post from three days ago:  
  
  
“Proud of my wife. Both mom and baby are safe. ?”  
  
  
Photo: our baby's tiny foot.  
  
  
I scrolled down. A month ago, he'd posted:  
  
  
""Weekend vibes ☕""  
  
  
Photo: two coffee cups. One black coffee. One latte.  
  
  
We both drank lattes. The black coffee was for Vivian.  
  
  
That day, I was home on bed rest. He said he was ""working late.""  
  
  
Guess he just didn't want to be around his pregnant whale of a wife.  
  
  
I put the phone down. Stared at the ceiling.  
  
  
The baby started crying.  
  
  
I tried to sit up. The incision ripped with pain.  
  
  
""Mary!"" I called out my mother-in-law.  
  
  
Nothing. The TV was too loud.  
  
  
I bit down hard, slowly pushed myself upright, and lifted the baby to nurse.  
  
  
Fifteen minutes later, the baby was asleep.  
  
  
I was drenched in sweat. My incision felt... wet.  
  
  
I looked down.  
  
  
Blood. Blood was seeping through the bandage.  
  
  
""Mary!"" I shouted louder this time.  
  
  
She finally shuffled in, annoyed. ""What's all the yelling? You'll wake the baby.""  
  
  
""I'm bleeding.""  
  
  
She glanced at my stomach. ""It's just a little blood. You're overreacting. When I had Charles, I was up and walking by day three.""  
  
  
""I had a C-section!""  
  
  
""So? Women these days are so dramatic.""  
  
  
She turned and left.  
  
  
I lay there, tears sliding down my face.  
  
  
Not from sadness. From pain.  
  
  
My incision hurt. My chest hurt.  
  
  
I grabbed my phone. Texted Charles:  
  
  
\> ""I'm bleeding from the incision.""  
  
  
Read.  
  
  
No reply.  
  
  
I waited five minutes. Texted again:  
  
  
\> ""When are you coming home?""  
  
  
Read.  
  
  
No reply.  
  
  
Twenty minutes passed. I typed again:  
  
  
\> ""Charles, I think I need to go to the ER.""  
  
  
This time, he replied.  
  
  
Three words:  
  
  
\> ""Ask my mom.""  
  
  
My hands were shaking as I typed back:  
  
  
\> ""Your mom said I'm dramatic.""  
  
  
Read.  
  
  
No reply.  
  
  
Fuck it! I threw the phone onto the bed. Closed my eyes.  
  
  
The baby cried again.  
  
  
I opened my eyes. Looked at his tiny, scrunched-up face.  
  
  
Little one, you really picked a hell of a time to be born.  
  
  
I slowly lifted him, my entire body trembling from the pain.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
4 PM. Charles still wasn't home.  
  
  
I'd called him 99 times. 98 went to voicemail. One, he declined.  
  
  
The 100th time, he finally picked up.  
  
  
The background was loud, filled with laughter.  
  
  
""What?""  
  
  
""My incision is still bleeding. I need to go to the ER.""  
  
  
""I TOLD you to ask my mom.""  
  
  
""Your mom said it's nothing!""  
  
  
""Then it's nothing.""  
  
  
I gripped the phone tighter. ""Charles, I'm in fucking pain!""  
  
  
""Vivian's place is a mess, I can't just—""  
  
  
""I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT VIVIAN! I'M YOUR WIFE!""  
  
  
The line went silent for a few seconds.  
  
  
Then I heard her voice. Soft. Sugary sweet.  
  
  
""Charles, where should I put this box?""  
  
  
He covered the phone. Muffled: ""Bedroom.""  
  
  
My stomach dropped.  
  
  
""Charles."" My voice was ice. ""Are you in her bedroom right now?""  
  
  
""I'm helping her move. Jesus Christ, Elena—""  
  
  
""You're in your ex-wife's bedroom while I'm bleeding at home with your child?""  
  
  
""DON'T START WITH ME!"" His voice exploded through the phone. ""I'm helping a friend! Why do you always have to make it about sex?!""  
  
  
""I didn't say shit about sex! I asked where you were!""  
  
  
""Your TONE says everything! You think I'm cheating? Seriously—""  
  
  
""My TONE?! My TONE is the problem?! Not the fact that you're playing house with your ex while I'm literally \*\*falling apart\*\*?!""  
  
  
""You're INSANE! I don't have time for this. Vivian can't move the furniture by herself.""  
  
  
""And what about me?""  
  
  
""You have my mom.""  
  
  
He hung up.  
  
  
I stared at the phone. My hands were shaking.  
  
  
Mary walked in, carrying a bowl of soup.  
  
  
""Stop screaming. You'll wake the baby.""  
  
  
""Mary."" I looked at her. ""My incision is infected.""  
  
  
""It's \*\*fine\*\*."" She set the soup down with a loud clank. ""Drink this. Sleep. You'll be fine.""  
  
  
""I need to go to the hospital.""  
  
  
""Hospital, hospital, HOSPITAL!"" She threw her hands up. ""Do you know how much an ER visit costs?! ""  
  
  
""I don't care what it costs—""  
  
  
""Well, I do! This family isn't made of money! You think we can just throw thousands of dollars away because you're a little uncomfortable?!""  
  
  
""Uncomfortable?!"" I yanked the blanket off. ""LOOK AT IT!""  
  
  
She glanced down. Her face twitched.  
  
  
""It's... it's just a little red—""  
  
  
""It's INFECTED! It's OOZING! Are you BLIND?!""  
  
  
""Don't you DARE raise your voice at me!"" Mary's face flushed red. ""You know who didn't act like this? Vivian had a C-section too. She was up cooking by day three. Never whined!""  
  
  
""You want to know why Vivian was so perfect?"" I leaned forward, ignoring the pain ripping through my abdomen. ""Because your son wasn't screwing someone else while she recovered.""  
  
  
Mary's face went white. Then red. Then white again.  
  
  
""I don't want to fight with you. Just rest, princess. Your drama can wait!""  
  
  
She turned and left.  
  
  
I leaned back against the headboard. Tears streamed down my face.  
  
  
I didn't know what to say. Or who to say it to.  
  
  
My parents were 500 miles away in Ohio.  
  
  
My mom had wanted to come help. My mother-in-law said no—insisted she could ""handle it.""  
  
  
My mom believed her.  
  
  
I believed her.  
  
  
Now I finally understood.  
  
  
She didn't want to ""handle it."" She wanted to make sure my mom couldn't come.  
  
  
I grabbed my phone. Texted my best friend, Sophia:  
  
  
\> ""Soph, can you come over? Please?""  
  
  
\> ""What's wrong?""  
  
  
\> ""My incision is bleeding. No one's helping me.""  
  
  
\> ""Where are you? I'm coming now!""  
  
  
Twenty minutes later, Sophia arrived.  
  
  
She took one look at my face and her expression darkened.  
  
  
""Jesus, Elena. You look awful.""  
  
  
She pulled back the blanket. Looked at my incision.  
  
  
""Holy shit.""  
  
  
Her face went pale.  
  
  
""We're going to the ER. Now!""  
  
  
She helped me stand. My mother-in-law jumped up from the couch.  
  
  
""Where are you going?""  
  
  
""Her incision is infected. She needs a doctor.""  
  
  
She walked over, glanced at my stomach.  
  
  
""Maybe it's not that bad...""  
  
  
Sophia ignored her. Kept walking me toward the door.  
  
  
""Wait—I'll call Charles—""  
  
  
""Don't."" My voice was quiet. But clear.  
  
  
""He's busy helping his ex-wife move.""  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
The ER doctor looked at my incision. His face darkened.  
  
  
""Why did you wait this long? This infection is severe. Another two days and you'd need surgery.""  
  
  
Sophia squeezed my hand. ""Doctor, what do we do now?""  
  
  
""Debridement. IV antibiotics. Immediately."" He looked at me. ""How many days postpartum?""  
  
  
""Fifteen.""  
  
  
""Has no one been taking care of you?""  
  
  
I didn't answer.  
  
  
The doctor sighed and started cleaning the wound.  
  
  
The pain was excruciating. I bit down on my lip, tears streaming down my face.  
  
  
Sophia stood beside me, her eyes red.  
  
  
When he finished, the doctor said I needed to be admitted. At least three days.  
  
  
Sophia helped me check in.  
  
  
Lying in the hospital bed, I picked up my phone. Charles had texted.  
  
  
\> 7:32 PM:""Where are you?""  
  
  
\> 7:45 PM:""Why aren't you home?""  
  
  
\> 8:01 PM:""My mom said you left?""  
  
  
\> 8:15 PM:""Call me back.""  
  
  
\> 8:30 PM:""WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?!""  
  
  
I checked the time. 9:03 PM.  
  
  
I replied:  
  
  
\> ""Hospital.""  
  
  
Three seconds later, my phone rang.  
  
  
""WHAT ARE YOU DOING AT THE HOSPITAL?!""  
  
  
""My incision got infected. I'm admitted.""  
  
  
""What?!""  
  
  
""Your mom said it was nothing. Turns out it was septic.""  
  
  
......  
  
  
""I... I'll come right now—""  
  
  
""Don't bother.""  
  
  
""What?""  
  
  
""I said don't bother."" My voice was flat. Calm. ""Did you finish helping Vivian move?""  
  
  
""Don't bring Vivian into this—""  
  
  
""Your son is with your mom.""  
  
  
I hung up. Turned off my phone.  
  
  
Sophia sat beside me, holding out a water bottle. ""Babe, he's a piece of shit!""  
  
  
I didn't take the water. Just stared at the ceiling.  
  
  
""Soph, I need you to check something for me.""  
  
  
""Check what?""  
  
  
""Charles's bank statements. Last month.""  
  
  
Sophia blinked. ""You have access?""  
  
  
""Yeah.""  
  
  
We'd set up a joint account when we got married. I had login credentials.  
  
  
I sent her the info. She pulled out her laptop, fingers flying across the keyboard.  
  
  
Five minutes later, her face went white.  
  
  
""Soph?""  
  
  
She turned the screen toward me.  
  
  
I saw a transaction.  
  
  
March 15th. $50,000 transferred.  
  
  
Memo: ""Vivian—moving expenses.""  
  
  
I stared at the number. My chest felt... empty.  
  
  
When I was in labor, Charles said the hospital was too expensive. He made me switch from a private room to a shared ward.  
  
  
We saved $3,000. He said we'd use it for the baby's formula.  
  
  
Now I knew where the money went.  
  
  
I scrolled up.  
  
  
February 28th. $8,000 transferred.  
  
  
Memo: ""Vivian—car insurance.""  
  
  
February 14th. $2,000 transferred.  
  
  
Memo: ""Vivian—birthday.""  
  
  
January 30th. $12,000 transferred.  
  
  
Memo: ""Vivian—rent.""  
  
  
January 15th. $5,000 transferred.  
  
  
Memo: ""Vivian—""  
  
  
Sophia slammed the laptop shut. ""IS HE FUCKING MARRIED TO YOU OR HER?! “  
  
  
I lay back on the bed.  
  
  
""Soph. Take screenshots. All of these transactions.""  
  
  
She did. Sent them to me.  
  
  
I saved them into a new folder.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

Spent two months never missing a single day and still stuck at 290 views per video.

Here's all the ""expert advice"" I followed that did nothing:
- posted at the exact same time every single day
- built a content calendar to stay consistent for months
- never skipped a day even when I was sick or busy
- even batch created content to maintain my daily schedule
- tracked my consistency religiously in a spreadsheet

And my numbers didn't move at all. Started thinking maybe I need to post twice a day or the timing still isn't right.

But here's what I figured out in the past 9 days, consistency wasn't my problem at all.

Went back through my last 31 videos and tracked where people were actually leaving. Turns out posting every day didn't matter when each video had the same retention issues.

Found 3 things killing my videos that consistency couldn't fix:

**Everyone says consistency builds your audience. Wrong. My hook quality was the issue.** I posted every day but 69% of people scrolled within 2 seconds on generic openers like ""wait for it."" Switched to ""used my left hand for everything for a week and spilled coffee 11 times"" and kept 72% through second 5. Posting more often doesn't help if every video has a weak hook.

**Everyone says the algorithm rewards consistency. But my content pacing killed me.** I never missed a day but was losing everyone at second 6-8 because I wasn't delivering value fast enough. Been focusing on quantity when I should've been fixing quality issues. Posting daily just meant putting out 60 videos with the same problems instead of fixing them.

**Everyone says consistent posting trains the algorithm. But retention matters more.** Videos posted on schedule with 48% retention died. Videos posted randomly with 68% retention performed way better. My retention jumped by fixing dead air and pacing, not by posting more consistently. The algorithm pushes videos people watch, not videos posted on time.

Honestly only caught this because I started using TlkAlyzer to see exactly when people dropped. Regular analytics made me think I needed more consistency when really each video had fixable retention problems.

Posted 6 videos focusing on quality over schedule. Video 1 hit 4.4k views compared to my 290 average. Video 2 got 3.6k, video 3 reached 6.3k, video 4 landed at 4.9k, video 5 got 3.8k, and video 6 hit 5.7k views. Not huge but it's the first time consistency actually started helping because the content was worth watching.

Not saying consistency doesn't matter. Just wasn't my bottleneck. And I wasted 8 weeks posting daily without fixing the actual problems in my content.

Posting this because if you've been posting consistently with no results, maybe you're just consistently putting out content with the same issues. Not claiming I've figured everything out, but this is the first thing that moved my numbers in 8 weeks.

I work in at a chain coffee shop right now and although it’s paying the bills, it’s not what I went to college for. Furthermore, I feel stagnant—there’s only one path to grow and it’s not a path that I’d want. 

All the work experience I’ve had has been in a retail/customer service setting yet most, if not all, of my skills transfer well into office work. Besides, in my eyes, it’s not \*that\* much of a leap. All it takes is getting used to it and adapting, which I’ve done before and can do again. 

I’ve reached out to staffing agencies and I’ve gotten nothing. I’d want to reach out to them again but I have no idea how to go about it or how to get their attention.

There’s no call centers in my area either, which is the way many people transition. It doesn’t help when I’m applying/looking for entry-level admin and office roles and they ALL require 2+ years of office experience. 

So where do I go from here? How do I make the jump? I’m so desperate at this point to make the leap yet it seems like there’s nowhere for me to go. At this point, I might just go to grad school, even though I just started paying my student loans.",2,1766062421.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

1ppq2me,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ppq2me/got_married_9_months_ago_and_things_have_gone_so/,Got married 9 months ago and things have gone so wrong so quickly. Am I over-reacting? Need advice please.,"
I (27F) live in India. I work a really good corporate job. 3 years back I met my now husband (29M), who was also in the same company. He told me he had gone through a bad break-up 2 years back and we honestly just started off as me trying to help him out of that phase. He later said that was what made him fall in love with me 

Cut to 8-9 months later, we were doing long distance. My parents asked if I was serious about this boy. He seemed extremely non-committal, which I brushed off, thinking it was because of the short time we had spent together. We are from different states, different communities, he is a vegetarian, I am a non-vegetarian (it did not matter to me but these things do matter in India). Have to mention here that I earn ~30-40% more than he does, but both of us earn really well. 

Anyway, he told his parents sometime later and they seemed happy. Here is where it gets weird. They had lived in a house in a small town all their lives, the moment the marriage was certain, they promptly sold it.  We found it weird but did not probe. But they were in a super hurry to get us married. Next 3 months if possible. We wanted to wait a year or two, they refused. He fell conveniently silent, after promising me he would talk it out at home, later telling me “the parents have decided, what to do, anyway, what is it that you cannot do after marriage, I am not stopping anything in your life”. I was too much in love, so gave in to an early marriage. 

After marriage, is when things got weirder. We had decided to live in my hometown (where our company is headquartered, so we could both get roles easily, plus my mom was diagnosed with cancer a while back so I wanted to be nearby). He seemed okay with that pre-marriage and got a transfer. 

Once we were married however, he started saying how living there makes him earn less (our company is one of the only companies in that city, he was not okay with a wfh job), how he is forced to live with me instead of shifting to another city & earning more. They grew up without a lot of money. We are better off. He kept telling me that his only goal is to earn more money and I am too privileged to understand. He said it is unfair that we should contribute equally to household expenses and I need to give more. Logically I was okay with it. 

But post marriage, he stopped paying almost anything. He gave rent, but that was it. For everything from eating out to cabs, it was “you pay, you know I have no money”. We bought a car, with me paying EMIs and him agreeing to pay petrol, once it was bought, he said he cannot pay for petrol either. If I even spent on coffee outside, with my money, it was “this is our money, why are you spending uselessly”. 

Almost all of his salary he sent home, to his parents. We furnished our house, every appliance my parents and I paid for, the moment I asked him to contribute, it was “your parents did not even gift the things they were supposed to, how dare you ask me to pay”. Every expense he made, from food to a cola, he insisted I pay half, with him maintaining each expense record and tallying every month if I have paid “what you were supposed to”

These became arguments very quickly, and got ugly. Did not help that his mom kept intervening about how I should behave, how to set up the house, what to cook, that he could only like food made by her and how much he is suffering by being deprived of good food. He kept telling me something and his mom something else after assuring me he would handle it. Never stood up for me. 

He refused to participate in anything regarding my family, making weird rules “I meet my parents once a month, why should you meet once a week”. Found it hurtful. He treats his family with love, always there for them, yet never for me. Simple things like eating out was a challenge “why waste money/who will spend money on vacations” etc. I always felt like last priority, he would explicitly refuse to do things I asked, like making me wait for 8 hours after I had travelled a long way to meet him, saying “I had work, what to do”

His dad got diagnosed with cancer too, 3 months back. He started insisting we need to change location immediately and I am “selfish for wanting to stay near your family whereas I am making all sacrifices”. More and more he started to ask me to pay – our expenses, dad’s treatment, everything.  

His dad has gotten progressively worse and he grew more insistent on us shifting, me paying heavy sums for treatment, But (and I feel crazy and horrible saying this), his father looks fine? He is attending all family events, celebrating, dancing, eating and it seems abnormal for stage IV gastric cancer.
 
Anyway, the final straw came last month when we told me “you are selfish to expect me to be happy and celebrate in your festivals when my dad is dying” and then immediately going off to celebrate with his family, saying “I have realized being sad does no good”, and saying that we NEED to shift to his hometown (no other city works) otherwise the marriage is off, and we cannot stay here because my parents are manipulating us, my mom is scheming to feed him non-vegetarian food (mom takes the utmost care to specially prep veg for him and only asked if he wanted to try the rice in a chicken rice bowl). 

I am uncomfortable doing anything under coercion and tired of the arguments, so stopped staying with him. He made zero attempt to contact for a week, then came back saying he will fix things and they will get worse if I do not return.

There were happy moments. He has flown in at moments notice to care for me when I have fallen ill, he did get me a pretty expensive tablet for my last to last birthday. Wakes up early even at 4am to make food for me if I have to travel. Which adds to my confusion. I cannot reconcile these aspects. 

Am I over-reacting in thinking of separating.

I’ve been on this pumping journey for a while now, and I’ve tried pretty much all the big names—Momcozy (M9/S12), Elvie, Willow Go, and another generic brand. I've used four different wearable pumps in total!That hands-free life is amazing, but I wanted to jump in with a quick warning: If your wearable pump leaks, you are NOT doing it wrong!Leakage is super common with almost all wearables. It’s usually not a defect; it’s just the nature of the design. Here's why it happens and the life-saving tips I picked up from months of trial and error (and cleaning up spilled milk):Why Leakage is the Universal Wearable Pump StruggleAfter using four different pumps, I can confirm these issues pop up across all brands:Gravity and Vent Holes: Every wearable needs a way to let air in/out (venting) or a port for pouring. If you tip the pump too far forward, back, or sideways, gravity takes over and milk exits those holes. This is the #1 reason for spills.The Seal is Everything: The cup relies entirely on a perfect, airtight seal between the silicone flange/diaphragm and the collection cup. A slight twist, a tiny piece of lint, or a bit of moisture can break that seal and cause leakage right at the breast or cup seam.Heavy Flow vs. Full Cup: If you have a powerful letdown, the milk enters the cup with force and sloshes. If the cup is already near its maximum fill line (especially if you're close to 6 or 7 ounces), the risk of hitting those internal vent spots is much higher.My Pro Tips from Four Pumps (To Prevent Spills)If you follow these three rules, you can dramatically cut down on leaks and save your precious milk:1. The ""Squat, Don't Bend"" RuleNEVER bend over from your waist. I learned this the hard way with my Elvie. If you need to pick up a toy, a baby, or something off the floor, SQUAT DOWN while keeping your back and torso relatively straight. This keeps the pump upright and the milk centered at the bottom of the cup.Be Gentle with Movement: Think of it like carrying a tray full of coffee. Quick, jerky movements are a recipe for disaster.2. The ""Pre-Pump Check"" RoutineEnsure Dry Parts: This is a huge one for Momcozy users. After washing, make sure all silicone parts (duckbills, diaphragms, and flanges) are completely dry before assembly. Any moisture can make the seal slippery and weak.The Press Test: When re-assembling the cup, gently but firmly press the silicone insert into the plastic cup all the way around the edges. You should feel a secure, flush fit. If it's slightly crooked, it will leak.3. Maintenance is Key to SuctionReplace Worn Parts: The silicone duckbill valves and diaphragms lose elasticity over time. If your suction feels weak or you suddenly start leaking more often, it’s usually time for a valve refresh (check your manufacturer's suggestion, usually every 4-8 weeks). New valves often fix unexpected leakage issues.Bottom line: Wearable pumps are incredible for freedom, but they need to be treated gently. Manage your expectations (they aren't perfect!), follow the ""squat rule,"" and you'll save yourself a lot of wasted milk and laundry!Has anyone else struggled with specific brands leaking? Would love to hear your hacks too!",1,1766062011.0,NewParents,2,1.0,False
1pppwxh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pppwxh,Ceado E6 Coffee Grinder - anyone know how to remove the bolt from the bottom stirrer inside the doser without snapping something? See photos! Thank you!  [CEADO E6 COFFEE GRINDER],"**TLDR: How to loosen the bolt in the photo without breaking the coffee grinder?**

**LONG VERSION**: I have acquired an old ex-commercial Ceado E6 doser coffee grinder and I'm trying to strip it down to give it a thorough clean so that I can use it at home.

The machine was very clean on the parts that could be got to (so the coffee shop I'd got it from had obviously been scrupulously careful about cleaning the parts that could be readily accessed) but it had some absolutely disgusting bits of old coffee stuck at various places inside it once dismantled so there's no way I'm using it until it's fully cleaned out (and it makes me wonder how clean really are the machines that they use in coffee shops)?The stirrer has a really nasty old-coffee smell to it so I'm sure there is going to be something unpleasant hiding under it - but I can't get it off!

I'm stuck on what seems to be the very last bolt (shown from above and beneath in the photos) - the 13mm bolt going through the middle of the doser. The issue is that the bolt is free to move and when turned it spins the stirrer inside the doser (not sure of official name). I haven't found a way to lock the stirrer in place so that I can apply sufficient torque to undo the bolt without breaking something.

I havve tried the obvious idea of putting a screwdriver into the stirrer to jam it in place and giving the bolt underneath some serious heft with a spanner but the stirrer is quite thin and the amount of torque I was applying was starting to make me concerned about snapping the stirrer (something I don't want to do!).

I've got the official maintenance manual and it just says ""DO NOT TAKE THE DOSER APART"" which is very helpful...not.

Anyone know the answer to this? Maybe the bolt is held in place with something like epoxy resin and undoing it is a bad idea? Or maybe it needs to be precisely calibrated so even if I get it apart I won't get it back together properly? Thanks for any thoughts you may have!!",1,1766061904.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Some info: I am a white 25y male with overall good health except for some conditions like IBS, GERD and gastritis. (Average height and weight)

Backstory- I’ll keep it short but you can skip this part if you dc- it goes like this - Chronic stress, working abroad, GI issues which led to lots of inflammation, it got so bad I started 5 mg escitalopram to cope but quit it cold turkey after 10 days because it was making me tired. Then some alcohol, then a common cold or something. All of this led to slowly increasing brutal waves of fatigue and anxiety.Post viral fatigue, CFS or depression- no one knows but doc assumes it’s depression so he prescribed 5 mg escitalopram which cured my anxiety but not the depression itself. I was still always tired, unmotivated and depressed so I upped to 10 mg. The issue is that It made me apathetic and emotionally numb so I lowered to 5 mg but was still constantly tired + sexual dysfunction and brain fog.  After being roughly 4 months on escitalopram my psychiatrist suggested a DIRECT switch to 5 mg vortioxetine.

Additional info: I have never tested myself if I’m a good SSRI metaboliser but I am definitely sensitive to medication- I need the lowest doses to feel effect.

Okay so day 1:

I drank it in the morning with food and coffee. Effects kicked in almost immediately- I felt slightly more energetic than usual, also dry mouth, hot flashes and increased numbness in the private parts. Nothing too crazy. I was feeling a bit of insomnia when I tried to fall asleep.

Day 2:

Again with food and coffee-I feel even more energetic- “tired but wired”, mood dipped, slightly nauseous, more dry mouth, light headache, feels more like a street drug than a prescription medicine. Overall worse mood than when I was on 5 mg cipralex. I can feel anxiety and panic crawling back. Stimulation lasts a few hours then evens out- Also I feel a bit more concentration- like I’ve smoked that first cigarette in the morning ( I don’t smoke anymore). It kind of feels like smoking weed. You can definitely feel the stimulating effects, but don’t get me wrong- there is no high adrenaline, barely able to breathe type of stimulation- it’s more mental.

3. Since my current SSD is dying, I opted to get a heat sink on this one. Didn't realize SSD could get so hot.
4. I don't know much about AIO or the ""ARCTIC"" range, but this one seemed fairly highly rated?
5. Worth getting a 12000w PSU to future proof the build a bit more, or is that overkill?
6. Motherboard always confuse me, is this a reliable board and does it future proof me well? In case I buy extra SSD or the new GPU, etc.

1pppr4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewJunkies/comments/1pppr4i/struggling_with_bad_breath_we_tested_prodentim_to/,Struggling with Bad Breath? ✳️ We Tested ProDentim to See If It Rebuilds a Healthy Oral Microbiome,"# [REVIEW] 30 Days on ProDentim : Can This Chewable Probiotic Rebalance Your Mouth Bacteria?

# 😬 Introduction ...

If your mouth feels gross, *everything* feels gross. I’m talking dry tongue, sore gums, and breath that could clear a yoga class. It hits your confidence, and even your social energy.

Brushing harder doesn’t fix it. What most people miss is the simple fact that the good bacteria in your mouth might’ve been wiped out by your well-meaning toothpaste or daily rinse.

So, some clever bods created [ProDentim](https://theworldhealth.org/prodentim-101-text-official) \- an oral probiotic that doesn’t just freshen breath; it supports your **oral microbiome** where it matters most. I did the research and tested it. Here's everything you need to know.

This time, my friend Caleb takes the reins ...

# 📦 Product Overview

**Product Name**: ProDentim  
**Category**: Health & Wellness ➝ Oral Health Supplements  
**Overall Verdict**: 4.8/5

# 🔍 What Is ProDentim?

**ProDentim** is a chewable supplement with **3.5 billion CFU** of beneficial bacteria. It helps feed the good microbes that live in your mouth and keeps the bad ones in check.

Each tablet includes **inulin**, **malic acid**, and **tricalcium phosphate**, all ingredients popular in **supplements that support oral hygiene** and healthier gums.

It's not some chalky tablet either. These are easy to chew, slightly minty, and designed for people who want a *simple* way to support their **oral health**.

# ⚙️ How Does ProDentim Work?

ProDentim works by helping you **restore healthy bacteria in your mouth** after years of mouthwash or sugary coffee stripped it clean.

By using **chewable probiotic supplements for oral care**, it helps deliver strains like *Lactobacillus Paracasei* and *B.lactis BL-04®* right to the gums and teeth.

Using these live strains with other **probiotics you can chew for dental support**, improves the environment inside your mouth and reduces dryness, odor, and irritation.

It's a **natural solution for oral health**, giving your mouth [the nutrients it needs](https://theworldhealth.org/prodentim-101-text-official) without blasting it with chemicals.

# 🧪 Benefits: What Can You Expect?

With consistent use, I noticed a big shift in how my mouth felt. The **results from using my ProDentim supplement** became more obvious by week two.

Gum sensitivity faded, and my breath? Crisp. Not “minty cover-up” fresh—just **healthier bacteria levels** making everything feel... clean.

These **natural methods to heal your gums**, seem to work particularly well if you’re someone who drinks coffee, eats sugar, or uses harsh oral care products often.

Many users say it’s among the **best probiotics for adult dental health**, especially if you're done relying on quick-fix breath sprays or abrasive pastes.

# ✅ Is ProDentim Safe?

Yes, it’s safe for most people. The formula uses clean, **non-GMO**, gluten-free ingredients and doesn’t contain stimulants or harsh chemicals.

I did experience some bloating on day two—very common with **probiotics that help with gum disease** or gut support—but it passed quickly.

This supplement may help **correct an oral bacteria imbalance** gently and effectively, without drying out your mouth like alcohol-based rinses can.

# 🧑‍🦱 My Personal Experience (Told by a Friend)

One of my running buddies, **Caleb**, is a 42-year-old cycling coach who’s super dialed into his health—but not so much his dental routine.

We met through a local wellness group, and over the years, he's become my go-to source for all things anti-inflammatory and electrolyte-related.

But let’s just say oral care was never at the top of his “optimization” list.

He told me he [started trying ProDentim](https://theworldhealth.org/prodentim-101-text-official) after noticing his breath wasn’t exactly trail-friendly during early-morning rides.

Plus, he was getting annoyed with how his gums felt sensitive after long sessions of energy gels and sugary hydration mixes.

His dentist mentioned **probiotics that reduce mouth inflammation**, so he decided to test the supplement for a couple of months.

Caleb said within about two weeks, his mouth just felt “cleaner,” and the weird metallic taste he’d sometimes get after a tough ride was gone.

He also noticed **less gum irritation** around that back molar where his bite guard rubs.

His breath was fresher too—something his fiancée confirmed, which I think he appreciated even more than the dental perks.

The only minor drawback? He found the chewables a bit sweet at first, probably because he’s not a fan of stevia. But he got used to it after a few days and stuck with the routine like he does his protein shakes.

So yeah, Caleb’s verdict? “This stuff's legit—especially for athletes who push their bodies but forget about their mouths.”

# 💭 Gut vs. Mouth Probiotics

A lot of folks wonder about **comparing gut probiotics to oral probiotics**. They’re very different.

Gut probiotics focus on digestion and immunity, while oral strains are meant to live on your gums, tongue, and teeth. One doesn’t replace the other.

So if your goal is **helping** [restore good bacteria](https://theworldhealth.org/prodentim-101-text-official) **in your mouth**, you need the specific strains ProDentim offers.

Six months later and restaurants are still torture, watching my wife eat bread requires actual mental effort, family gatherings with pasta make me want to cry, all that good stuff. I can resist them, that's not the issue, I haven't cheated once but the constant mental battle is exhausting even when I'm winning it. I don’t know how true this is but I feel like for me willpower is definitely a finite resource and by that logical I’m kinda going bankrupt everyday. Anyways I tried the caffeine stuff but that just doesn’t feel great, I’m not really a coffee person anyways. I drink a lot of water and that probably makes it better but I’m so used to it that it’s not worth much to me and like I can always do that but it will only help a little bit. So I looked at the supplement side and it was hard to find caffeine free stuff for appetite but I found a few and started trying ozzi since it's keto friendly and zero sugar, I’m mainly using it evenings when cravings hit hardest. It is helping somewhat but it doesn’t solve the whole problem for me so I’m still wondering if the cravings themselves ever actually go away or if we all just get better at tolerating the mental fight. Because I love the results but idk if I can do this forever if it never lets up.

1pppnol,https://www.reddit.com/r/burnedout/comments/1pppnol/burnout/,Burnout,"Hey everybody, I hope all is well. This post is a bit vulnerable for me to take but I am making it in the hope of seeing other people who have gone through this and have recovered. 

So for about 2 weeks and some days, I was barely getting any sleep. I would go to sleep at 8-9 am, sometimes even earlier. My body would automatically wake up at 2am so I just stayed awake on my phone until like 5-6 am. Sometimes I would fall asleep for maybe an or 2 more hours and sometime I would just go through the day we the amount of sleep I had. I believe it happened for 2 weeks. I also noticed my phone screen time was about 13 hours a day and this is not including the time I use on my laptop. I have an online business that requires a lot of screen activities but ngl sometimes I go on my phone to just scroll on social media as well.

Last Wednesday, I woke up at 2-3am as usual and I was actually planning to let my body rest that night because I had to take my little brother to get some check up the hospital at 7:30. But I didn’t go to sleep that night. Instead I was up on my device until like 5-6 am and when I did sleep it was only for an hour or two. I was a bit tired but went to the hospital but there I ended up drinking coffee but I also experience a head tension that was about 6/10 of pain. I got home, got on a phone call that lasted a few hours, rested for a bit, hopped on another call for about 30 mins and right after that I needed to have a meeting. During the meeting everything seems fine until I randomly felt a tension kind of like rubber band around your head. Felt like I needed to get off the screen. I ended up turning off the camera off in the meeting and since I never experienced anything like that, I had a little panic attack. I couldn’t even go on social media because I would feel that exact feeling again. I was sleepy but I couldn’t even sleep, my mind was just racing, and my body was even moving involuntarily. Best way I could describe is if you have so much energy that you couldn’t stay still except for this time, I was tired and my mind still couldn’t sleep. That night was hard, my thoughts were all over the place. The next couple days, i felt better, my mind got calmer and my body wasn’t moving involuntarily anymore. 

I went to the doctor on Friday to get a check up and they checked my blood pressure, did a EKG and told me everything was normal, and that I just need to rest more. I did some research and I was hearing things such as hyperarousal, that my mind was stuck in a fight-flight state, nervous system overstimulated etc.. At first I couldn’t even watch tv without my mind getting tired. I would need to just lay there and close my eyes. It seem like my brain was just tired. And at times my body would have energy but my mind wouldn’t. I couldn’t even go on walk for more than a certain amount of time. I started taking melatonin at time to help sleep more to make up for the sleep debt I had. 

Fast forward to a week, it seem I am getting better daily. I can watch tv now without the tension, I can go on social media for certain amount time until the tension comes again. But I still have a bit of issue with using the laptop. Last night I had a meeting that normally would’ve been so easy but I had to really push through. Which got me feeling scared and worried because all of this were so normal and easy for me but now, became harder. So my question would it, did anybody ever experience anything similar?

 (Ps: I can go on my phone and use it, I have no problem with that. It’s just when I go certain things like social media or when I am watching sometime close up)",1,1766061093.0,burnedout,0,1.0,False

1pppn98,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pppn98,9 Days of Davidoff Day 3: Winston Churchill Original,"If I’m sticking with mildest to fullest, technically I think today’s cigar should have been the Aniversario Entreacto. However, I may not have as much time to kick back tomorrow, so I’m arguably breaking my own rule and swapping the order of things in the interests of practicality, and skipping over the AE today to go with the Winston Churchill Original.

At 6 7/8” x 47, this is a chonk, and the longest cigar in the sampler - a true Churchill. I could be here a while.

The cold draw is smooth, but not as smooth as the Signatures. Instant notes of coffee and chocolate, possibly with some rich dark berry in there too. This is definitely a different profile to the Signatures.

These flavours remain off the bat as I light up. Luckily, the coffee notes emerge as more of a good heavy earthiness rather than an espresso, which, as someone who doesn’t like coffee, is a good thing.

Through the second third, the flavour develops with the full and heavy notes pulling back, with gentle leather and spice emerging. This is by no means a pepper bomb like the stereotypical non-Cuban, but a pleasant muted pepperiness that enhances the other flavours rather than overwhelming them. There’s a certain savouriness or umami that I don’t think I’ve experienced often before, or at all. The strength of the leather grows further during the second third. 

Into the final third. I’m over an hour in at this point. The softer flavours fall back and the overall strength really picks up. I need to nurse it carefully to not get overwhelmed. I’m glad I didn’t try to stick to order and have this one yesterday. Also, surprisingly, I get the first inconsistent burn line I’ve had on a Davidoff, possibly just down to the size making the probability higher. No matter, a quick touch up resolves that. 

Leaving the cigar rest and taking it slower helps the cigar mellow back down, but the cumulative strength still detracts from the flavours. I ultimately throw in the towel at around the 2 hour mark with about an inch to go. The final third is just too much today.

The construction and smoke production is excellent, like all Davidoffs so far, but it’s a thinner smoke than the Signatures, with less creamy roundness. After an inch or so, the smoke develops to be fuller, and continues to develop more through the cigar, although still not ultimately as thick as other cigars that have gone up like chimneys.

This is a hard cigar to place. I’d compare it to my conclusions on the Fonseca Cosacos: I don’t always want this flavour profile, but when I do, it would be a very nice selection. I think the Churchill size is ambitious and might be suitable for say a long session after a hearty meal (I’m thinking post- a big steak and spirits), but on an ‘ordinary’ day the same blend at a shorter length would be preferable. 

I’m also starting to see a pattern emerge with the Davidoffs where the strength really picks up in the final third, and not always for the better. This could be a unique attribute of the tobacco used requiring more careful nursing to avoid overheating and getting those bitter notes at the end. Alternatively, I’ve read somewhere that Davidoff suggests tossing the cigar when the burn reaches the band, which on some cigars can mean barely even getting into the final third, so if that’s the philosophy that the company takes it’s not surprising that they would blend their cigars accordingly.

Wondering if anyone may help me find it! 
Back in the days we called it chick lit 🤣 I read a book I swear was about two authors, or they need to work on a book together. A small town where they bump into each other, they know each other from the city, not fans of one another. I feel like he was freshly divorced, maybe she was? She was trying to get away and then ran into him and was frustrated. I’m having such a hard time remembering but I feel like there was a swing in the front yard in a tree. A little cafe she would get coffee. Geez I remember bugger all details. I think it would have been released pre 2015 at least, perhaps even older? Early 2000’s. 
Back in those days I was reading Maggie Alderson, Lauren Weisburger and the like. Minimal spice, like 1 star, fade to black (didn’t know smut existed back then - actually it was definitely pre 50 shades so 100% pre 2015)

The song's core is a disillusionment with the '90s idealism, shifting to self-absorption and pop culture's triviality, contrasting with the movie's high-stakes sales pressure. 

Meaning & Explanation

* **Title Origin**: From Alec Baldwin's famous line, ""Coffee's for closers only,"" in *Glengarry Glen Ross*, meaning only top performers (closers) get the perks.
* **FOB's Twist**: Wentz used this to contrast ""closers"" (successful salespeople) with pop culture/media focus, which spotlights celebrities instead of important issues.
* **Lyrics**: Lines like ""Throw your cameras in the air / And wave them like you just don't care"" and ""I will never believe in anything again / Though change will come"" reflect a cynical view that people care more about fame than real change, turning away from deeper issues.
* **Theme**: The song's about disillusionment, the ""me me me"" culture, and a loss of faith in collective good, preferring spectacle over substance, despite knowing real change is needed.",1,1766060854.0,Linda2024,0,1.0,False

While companies generally agree that the amount of plastic used must be reduced, many are questioning the effectiveness of the policy.   
   
The Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment on Thursday announced that it will revise the Act on the Promotion of Saving and Recycling of Resources next year to ban free disposable cups at cafes and similar establishments starting in 2027. Businesses that violate the rule could face fines or other penalties.

The plan allows cafes to set their own fees — typically 100 to 200 won (about 7 to 14 cents) per cup — but the government will set a minimum value based on production costs. Climate Minister Kim Sung-hwan described the approach as a “separate cup pricing system,” saying it would be less burdensome than the deposit program — currently implemented in some stores across the country — that requires customers to pay for cups upfront and return them for a refund.  
   
But cafe operators and industry sources say the announcement has caused confusion and raised doubts about whether the policy will meaningfully cut the amount of wasted plastic.  
   
Many franchise coffee shops already consider cup costs — often 100 to 200 won — when finalizing beverage prices. According to the ministry, the intent is to make those costs visible, not to charge customers twice. A ministry official offered an example: A drink currently listed at 4,000 won would, under the ban, be shown as 3,800 won for the drink plus 200 won for the cup.   
   
Operators argue that this will be harder to accomplish in practice. Cup costs vary across brands and stores and include delivery, labor and other overhead expenses. A representative of a low-cost coffee franchise said customers could complain if they see that fees differ from one store to another.   
   
Some owners also worry that separate fees could feel like a stealthy price increase. “If coffee prices stay the same but cups are charged separately, consumers are likely to feel that coffee prices have gone up,” an industry source said, predicting that sales would suffer.   
   


Disposable cups are displayed at a cafe in Seoul on Dec. 18. \[NEWS1\]

   
Independent operators question if a fee that small will change consumers' behavior. Cho Sang-hyun, who runs a cafe in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi, said customers who prefer disposable cups are unlikely to switch to tumblers to save 100 or 200 won. “The policy's effectiveness is low, and it could simply increase checkout time by requiring coffee and cup prices to be processed separately,” said Cho.  
   
A cafe owner in Seoul, identified by the surname Park, said she has already hired a part-time worker dedicated to washing dishes since the store became busier after disposable cups were banned for in-store use. “If the separate cup pricing system is introduced, I worry it will just increase the number of in-store customers,” she said.  
   
The industry is also growing tired of frequent changes to plastic reduction policies. A representative of a major cafe franchise said related policies keep changing with each administration, often before previous systems have had time to settle.  
   
Under the Moon Jae-in administration, a disposable cup deposit system was introduced, requiring customers to pay a 300-won deposit when buying drinks in disposable cups, which was refunded upon return.  
   


Beverages are served in disposable cups at a franchise coffee shop in Seoul. \[NEWS1\]

   
However, nationwide implementation was put on hold under the Yoon Suk Yeol administration. The Lee Jae Myung administration has since scrapped the deposit system and is pushing the separate cup pricing policy.  
   
“Clear standards and consistent policy implementation are needed to minimize confusion on the ground,” said an industry source.

1pppjq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/InfinityKingdom/comments/1pppjq5/elaborote_infinity_kingdom_scam/,Elaborote Infinity Kingdom Scam,"I've discovered this elaborate scam going on in Infinity Kingdom and other China owned P2W mobile games.  I'll give some background on how I discovered it, then explain how the scam works

Background:
I use an app called Freecash that pays you money for playing certain games as a side hustle whenever my work isn't busy.  Some of the best offers are on P2W mobile games, but you need to hit a certain power or camp level in a short amount of time, meaning you need to spend money to get the reward. This is basically a way for the companies to pay people to become whales so other people spend money to compete.

I started an offer for Call of Dragons and spent $500 to get the $700 reward for hitting 5 million power in 6 days.  This lead me to being #7 in power in my state, and these Chinese girls started messaging me

The Scam:
I started getting messages from people asking for help in the game. They saw I was high in the leaderboards and wanted advice. I thought that was sus, and just gave them basic advice. Then 2 of them said they were Chinese woman, 24 and 25 in age, and start making small talk and flirting, which was the first red flag. But I wanted to see how deep the rabbit hole went, so I played along. And like I suspected, they asked to message on a different app.

This is done so that their messages can't be reported in game for scamming. One wanted to message on Discord, the other Instagram. I used my anonymous accounts of course, because I was curious what the scam would be, I love trolling scammers and wasting their time. 

First Chinese girl was bland, she said she owned a coffee shop. Second Chinese girl was much more flirty using tons of emojis and sent anime gifs lol. She talked about how she wanted to visit America and me be her your guide 😂 I played along, and at the same time both girls ask me to play a different game, one said Last War Survival, and the other Infinity Kingdom. 

That was the major Scam red flag I was waiting for. I did some research and found some old reddit posts of very similar stories, Chinese woman, either in China or Singapore, will check the top leaderboards of different Pay to Win City builder games to find the people that spend the most money and message them asking for help, then pretend to want to be friends and message in a different app. 

They will then try to convince you to play a different Chinese P2W city builder game with them. They will then spend money and try to get you to spend money too. They either work for the company themselves, or have some underground recruitment bonus where they get a % of whatever you spend. They will pretend to be friends and flirt with you, and you will never know you're being scammed. 
Whales spend thousands of dollars on these games, managing to steal one for your game is huge money, that's why these scams exist. 

After realizing this, I start asking them a lot of questions. They claimed the new game had better graphics. I made an IP grabber to try and verify they were actually in China, and I got one of them to click it 😂 the first lady was smart and didn't click my fake link, but the second flirty one clicked it immediately. It showed them using a VPN connected to Las Angeles using a Windows computer using Microsoft Edge. I asked her why was using her computer if she wanted to play a mobile game and she freaked out 😂 when I revealed to her I knew exactly how the scam worked, she freaked out and broke character and started spam messaging me in Chinese. I used an auto translator to see she was calling me an idiot, that I would always be poor, and that I would never get a girlfriend 😂😂 it's so funny to me how mad scammers get when you waste their time, when their the ones trying to take people's money.  I used a translator to message back in Chinese saying Sorry you're not getting my money, and she blocked me 💀 

While I was able to sniff out the scam, Ive seen many stories of people who weren't so lucky. They didn't realize they were being scammed until they heard other people's stories. By then they've already spent hundreds or thousands on the game to impress a woman who's scamming 5 other guys at the same time.

TLDR: 
If an attractive Chinese woman messages you to ask you to play a game with them, don't do it ",0,1766060745.0,InfinityKingdom,0,0.5,False

2. Im confused about the part where Martha switches the coffee cup with Nat?


    Another thing that confused me about this is the way the event was told. It first appears so that Martha has drunk the coffee and only then Nat is revealing the plan to her. So what made her switch the cup even before she knew his plan?.

 Was she suspecting coz she knew what happened in the crypt and Nat was hiding?. Is this action of switching the drink just a precaution move?

No sugarcoating—just honest realizations and what I'm trying next.

After 14 years in IT, I was laid off 9 months ago. At first, I saw it as a blessing in disguise: a chance to pivot to a more relevant field (something involving higher stakeholder interaction and strategic decisions). I had savings, gratuity, and investments to cover expenses without panic, so I dove in headfirst - case studies, capstone projects, learning new tools. (Full disclosure: AI helped articulate a lot of those ideas.)

But reality hit hard:

The new field isn't something you can master solo. It's \~80% stakeholder management, tough trade-offs, and relationships - only 20% pure execution.

I'm not even interacting with 10 people from that field in a week. Building real insight requires conversations, not just reading or simulating.

I realized I'd outsourced too much thinking to AI instead of building my own ""mind muscle."" One podcast line stuck: ""If you can't clearly write down your problems, you can't solve them."" Half the battle is articulating issues properly.

On the personal side, things are strained. Married with a 5-year-old son, I've faced 5-6 police complaints (NC, no FIRs) over the last couple years - patterns suggest pressure tactics rather than genuine issues, possibly building grounds for something bigger. It makes you feel criminalized at home, and sometimes I wonder if lack of income plays into the respect dynamic (even though I handle my finances independently and she's earning well too).

I'm restless, juggling too much, and tired of polished online noise that feels like course-selling.

What I'm focusing on now (practical steps, no fluff):

Talk to more people genuinely: No agenda, no transactions - just listen and observe. Men, women, anyone in the field or adjacent. Start small: alumni networks, old colleagues, or casual coffee chats.

Narrow focus: Hustling everything at once burns you out. Pick one thing (for me, the career pivot), go deep, amplify later.

Find real-grounded groups: Tired of LinkedIn/Reddit pitches and quick video-call ""mentoring."" Looking for communities where people share actual fieldwork, challenges, and wins - no sales.

I'm shy about asking for help (have 3-4 close friends who know everything and would drop anything for me, but I haven't leaned on them yet).

If you've been through a mid-career break, pivot struggles, or tough personal dynamics - what real solutions worked for you?

Free/offline/online groups where people actually connect and share groundwork (not paid coaching)? Ways to network without judgment or expectations?

Stone Hound Brewing Company is taking over the former McLain building at 750 East Eighth Street, targeting an early summer opening for a second local taproom with a kitchen and basement lounge with pinball and arcade games. Two Sons Pizza – which is leaving The Coin Slot at the end of this month – is also coming to Eighth Street, targeting a late January opening inside Silver Spruce Brewing Company. *The Ticker* has the latest on these and numerous other restaurant/retail updates from around town.

**Eighth Street**  
Seeking to build on the success of its Acme taproom on Bunker Hill Road, **Stone Hound Brewing Company** is preparing to open a second location in 2026 near downtown Traverse City.

Owner Brent Faber has signed a lease with an option to purchase the McLain building on East Eighth Street. Work inside the building has already begun ahead of a targeted May or June opening for the new location. “For the upstairs street level, we want to keep the vibe very similar to the taproom in Acme,” Faber says. “We’re still working on the menu but thinking about bringing the greatest hits over: smash burgers, chicken burgers, wings, pretzels, things like that.”

Faber is targeting an “eighties basement” feel for the lower level with lounge furniture, pinball machines, stand-up arcade games, and possible pool tables. The bar will have TVs and show sports games, Faber says. He also plans to build an outdoor west-facing deck, though is still deciding if that will be part of the opening or a future phase of construction. Stone Hound will have a small 3.5-barrel system for the downtown location offering experimental brews but will produce most of its beer in Acme for the new spot.

Faber says he’s been looking to expand downtown for some time, considering options from the former Mackinaw Brewing building to the former Fresh Coast Beer Works space. Eighth Street ultimately was the right fit, he says. “It’s very visible and there are 26 parking spots, so plenty of parking,” he says, adding he hopes to be a “bridge” between Boardman Lake breweries like Filling Station, Silver Spruce, Rare Bird, and Right Brain and Tank Space further east on Eighth Street.  Stone Hound’s mug club, which has over 400 members, will be honored at both locations. While hours are still being determined, Faber hopes to be open for lunch and dinner seven days a week.

Also on Eighth Street, **Two Sons Pizza** is planning to open inside a newly renovated kitchen at Silver Spruce Brewing Company after finishing out its lease inside The Coin Slot at the end of this month. Owner Steve Tyson says he hopes to be open before the end of January in the new location, serving up the same popular New York-style pies along with new offerings including to-go salads and baked sandwiches like meatball parm, eggplant parm, and sausage and peppers. Tyson will turn over fried options that Two Sons currently offers – like French fries and zeppelis – to food truck **Toby’s Dog House**, which will continue operating in the Silver Spruce parking lot with a menu that includes hot dogs, gyros, tacos, and other bar bites.

Tyson is still determining his hours but notes that Two Sons has an exterior service window at Silver Spruce, meaning the restaurant can offer late-night pies outside of brewery hours. The new location is one of many changes for the business: Tyson recently opened a Two Sons pop-up in Grand Rapids and plans to soon expand there to two locations, one offering New York-style and one Midwest pizza. A large sports barcade is also planned for one of the sites.

**Other restaurant and retail news…**  
**Maxbauer Ace Hardware** is expanding in Traverse City. The company announced Tuesday that it is taking over the former Joann Fabrics space in East Bay Plaza on Munson Avenue with a targeted February opening date. The company has three other Traverse City area locations including on West Front Street, Chums Corner, and Bunker Hill Road. Maxbauer Ace Hardware is [hiring now for the new location](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=ace+hardware&latLong=44.67461%2C-85.65424&locString=Traverse+City%2C+MI%2C+49685&from=searchOnHP%2Cwhatautocomplete%2CwhatautocompleteSourceStandard&vjk=3a0e9e3ed3227822&fbclid=IwY2xjawOv8RpleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFFWUFVbXFPQk9NNDNBbU9Cc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHuoIVX3gyJBe9xUF2G1R8vrcrwSt1gN_Zr0NrHbj5eL-Hw2jDTiEms4YWr_W_aem_KTzcwPn9Jb3N1Vj9SNz14g).

Also on the east side, **Bayside Market** is under new ownership at 1532 US-31. Dan and Kim Summers have partnered with **Francisco’s Market & Deli** owners Michael Krenzke and Adam Inman to purchase Bayside Market from owner Rick Summers. The four partners will operate the business as **Francisco’s Bayside Market**, continuing to offer Bayside classics like meat, seafood, and BBQ Fridays with Francisco’s offerings like pizza, breakfast, and hot soups. Inman tells *The Ticker* the partners, who took over on December 8, are installing equipment like pizza ovens and hot cases with a goal of rolling out the new offerings by the start of the year.

Also changing hands is the **Flour Pot Bakery and Coffeshop** on River Street in Elk Rapids, recently purchased by Jill and Scott Thomas from Rob and Lindsey Rebhan. The Thomases, who own coffee brands Freedom Hill Coffee Roasters and Michigander Coffee Co., said they plan to “put our hearts into every part of this bakery, making delicious things and providing you with coffee we are really proud of.” The duo has maintained normal winter hours at the bakery through the transition of Thursday-Saturday 7am-2pm. A few doors down, **River Street Market** owners Shaun and Raven Quinn recently announced they have sold the business, thanking customers in a Facebook post for their support over the years. The company’s last day open will be Tuesday (December 23). The new owners/plans for the space haven’t yet been announced.

Traverse City commissioners Monday approved a new liquor license for **Blue Goat Wine & Provisions** that will allow the wine shop at 875 East Front to open an “intimate, boutique wine bar experience,” according to the application. The new bar area can accommodate 6-7 guests to start (with plans to expand to 10-12) enjoying Michigan and global wines and food pairings. “This is not a wine store with added seating, but rather a true wine bar experience that emphasizes responsible service, curated selections, and hospitality,” the application states.

New gastropub **Acorn Kitchen** has opened inside the Atomic Marketplace at 3344 Cass Road, home to Seismoto Coffee Bar and Nocturnal Bloom Brewing. Led by chef Zachary Anderson, the rotating menu features items like chicken and veggie shawarmas, smash burgers, short rib, soups and salads, and grab-and-go specialty breakfast sandwiches for Seismoto. A grand opening party is planned for Saturday (December 20) at 4:30pm featuring live music with Jimmy Olson, food, beer, coffee, and raffle prizes.

For the first year ever, **Bardon’s Wonder Freeze** is staying open year-round at 1100 East Front Street. The company will be open Thursday-Sunday 12pm-7pm with an extended menu, serving smoked barbecue Friday through Sunday. Lunch and dinner specials will include smoked brisket, baby back ribs, smoked twinkies, and a full array of sides. Bardon’s is also now offering both its ice cream and food menu through Door Dash. Further down the road on Munson Avenue, **Kpochami** announced it will close for 3-4 weeks in January to upgrade its hood, which will allow for an expanded menu. Also on the food front, Tank Space has launched a self-serve dehydrated ramen bar called **Kumite Underground Noodles** offering various noodle and topping options with hot water.

On the retail front, Traverse City’s **Nolan’s Cigar Bar** is expanding to Grand Rapids. The company bought Tuttle’s Select Cigars & Tobacco and are rebranding the business **Nolan’s Cigar Lounge**. Finally, another downtown Traverse City business is on the move. Hair salon **Union and Mane** recently announced it will be relocating across the street from its current location at 420 Union Street to a new space at 417 Union Street. “This new space isn’t just about walls, it’s about people,” the company posted. “With room to grow our team and expand our vision, moving across the street truly feels like the next chapter of the bigger plan.”",17,1766060521.0,traversecity,4,1.0,False

I’ve tested both properly — laptop out, calls taken, long sessions — no side-eye, no rush, solid WiFi, relaxed vibe.

1. Rotonda Bar – Xewkija Main Square
This place is a hidden gem for remote work. Big open square, calm atmosphere, reliable free WiFi and zero stress if you stay for hours. Perfect for deep work, writing, coding or just getting stuff done while enjoying Gozo’s slow pace. Bonus: the Rotunda view never gets old.

2. Pjazza Bar – Main Square (DO + FR only)
Also very remote-worker friendly if you stick to drinks and food. No laptops-for-one-espresso nonsense. Sit there all day, order properly, work in peace. Free WiFi, central location, and a genuinely relaxed vibe.

Both places are ideal if you want to work the whole day, not just squeeze in an hour between coffees.

If you’re in Gozo and working remotely, save this.

And if you know more spots like this on the island, drop them below — always hunting for places that actually welcome remote workers.

1pppdeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1pppdeu/help_birthday_gift_for_wife_beginner_espresso/,Help! Birthday gift for wife – Beginner Espresso Machine under 25k,"Hi everyone!
My wife’s birthday is coming up and I want to surprise her with her first proper espresso machine. We are both absolute beginners in the world of espresso, though we’ve been using a Bialetti Moka Pot for a while now.

We mostly prefer medium to dark roast coffee (usually with milk/latte/cappuccino).
After a lot of research and getting lost in various threads, I’ve narrowed it down to two options:
1. De'Longhi Dedica (EC685/885)
2. HiBrew H10A

My dilemma: The Dedica seems like the ""safe"" brand-name choice with lots of mods available, but the HiBrew H10A seems to have better features (like the 58mm portafilter and PID) out of the box.

A few questions:
1. Given we are beginners and coming from a Moka Pot, which one is more user-friendly?
2. Are there any other machines in this 20k–25k range I should consider?
3. What essential accessories should I budget for immediately to ensure she has a good experience on day one?
4. Where should I buy from? I’d prefer to avoid Amazon for this purchase—are there reliable specialty coffee equipment sites in India?

Would love to hear from anyone who has used these or upgraded from a Moka Pot. Thanks in advance for the help!",1,1766060187.0,IndiaCoffee,1,0.67,False
