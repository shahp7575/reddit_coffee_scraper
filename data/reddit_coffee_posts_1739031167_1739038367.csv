Are you up for a spontaneous date? It’s been three years since my last relationship, and after a few failed attempts, I’m ready to put myself out there again. I want to meet someone who’s open to dating and, if things go well, building something serious.

I’ll admit—I’m not the best at socializing in real life, especially with women, but I figured I’d give this a shot. Who knows? Maybe you’re the one I’ve been looking for.

* From Cavite but moving to Makati this month for work
* 5’7” | Medium build | Moreno | Curly hair | Wears glasses (vision 250/200)
* Just started working out—results coming soon
* Workaholic but will always make time for the right person
* Talkative, funny, family-oriented (breadwinner), goal-driven, and a bit of a sleepyhead
* No vices
* A fur parent
* A bit of a romantic at heart
* I’d rate myself a **7/10 in looks**—hope you are too! Not photogenic, so I might look weird in photos.

1. A bunch of you have mentioned that the Park site has to be a severance site, Westworld style

1iktiac,https://i.redd.it/5e48qw57hyhe1.jpeg,"Radical Purpose, Chapter 1: The Start of a Purpose.","Amongst the population of the world of **Robloxia**, lived a legend. Nay, a *Dream*.

 They dreamed of place where all lived in harmony, where beings from all across Dimensions and Time revelled in eachother’s company in absolute peace. “**The Rupture**” they called it, no harm ever came to those who lived there. But then again, it was just a dream.


[*A.B’s POV*]

Just a few more hours and she could go home!


**Abandoned Facility** wasn’t exactly what you called “normal”. I mean, she was probably the only one in the city to walk around with armor made out of glowsticks.


She works as a cashier’s in “Unknown’s Cafe”, the local coffee shop, that was starting to get popular in the city of Haxtonia. The owner was always a little… eccentric but Abandoned Facility thought of her as her only friend. Sure, the pay was horrible, but she was just too shy to ask for a pay raise.


The sun was already setting down, just a few more hours and she’d get to go back to her dirty apartment. It wasn’t the best life, but at least she has one! That’s more than some people can say…

She was snapped out of her day dreaming by the sound of the door opening. One of the last few customers of the day. She couldn’t screw this up.

The man that walked in was kinda weird. He wore a big green cloak, his eyes were barely visible let alone his face. He walked up to random customers and showed off his “backflips”.


Okayyy, sure he was disturbing everyone, but he couldn’t be that bad. Right? It’s not like she had the courage to kick him out anyways.


[*Hunter’s POV*]

What a great day to be The Great Mighty Hunter! 


Hunter was a little bored, his wife had just went on a year long hunting trip. What a better way to pass the time than to cause some mischief? The city of Hatonia was the perfect target. It was peaceful and calm, Hunter was gonna finally be considered as a threat!

But first, a little snack wouldn’t hurt. The local cafe seems pretty good. 

He walked and raised his arms, expecting the peasants to applaud him. Silence. They were probably too stunned by his grace to do anything.

Hunter observed the area, he could tell the owner went for an old-timey theme. Though, in this modern society, it was out of place. 

He walked up to the cashier, he guessed she was a mighty warrior, due to the heavy armor she was wearing. He’d better keep his guard up against her. 

Hunter: “Excuse me, miss? May I have a slice of that cake you’ve got there?” Hunter smirked, expecting her to squeal in joy at the sight of him.


[A.B’s POV]

Oh no, this wasn’t good. She would actually have to engage in a social interaction! Usually, people just take whatever they want without paying and she’d let them because she’s wasn’t a hero! She was just a coward hiding behind the armor she was wearing.

A.B: “Uh, of course! L-Let me get that for you?” She tripped as she turned around, already off to a bad start.

She came back to the counter with a cup of apple juice.


A.B: “H-Here you go!”


[Hunter’s POV]

He was stunned. How could somebody mishear someone so great so BADLY.

Hunter: “Are you deaf? Or simply an idiot! Is this a farce? Is this poisoned?!”

A.B: “A- b-but I, I didn’t mean to-“

(Insert Hunter yelling noise here.)


**10 Minutes Later**

[A.B’s POV]

The man had finally calmed down, it took 10 minutes of her crying but she finally got him to calm down. He sat down in his seat as he continued the conversation.

Hunter: “What’s a warrior like you doing working in a coffee shop?”

A.B: “But I’m not a warrio-“ She was cut short.

Hunter: “Where were you born? I assume you’re from the West, bunch of fighters are born there.” 

A.B: “ I was born her-“

Hunter: “What’s your opinion on me? The Great Mighty Hunter!”

A.B: “You’re… alright I guess..”

Hunter: “Good answer!”

He thought for a second, twiddling a arrow with his fingers.

Hunter: “I know! Ever since my wife left I’ve been looking for an assistant! Why don’t you come work for me? You seem like you’d make a pretty nice meatshie- I mean, sidekick!”

A.B: “But I-“

Hunter: “Great! You start… right now! Let’s go to my secret lair!”

He grabbed her by the armor and jumped out the window with her. 


She was pretty scared, she had just gotten KIDNAPPED.

A.B: “S-SOMEONE HELP ME!”


[???’s POV]

A glass of wine was held in her hand.

“Hey Exec?”

“Yes, Miss?”

“You know what I’m gonna do when I find The Rupture?”

“What?”

“I’M GONNA SELL THEM TONS OF SHIT!!!”

(Insert maniacal laughing)

[Our POV]

This was a start.

The start of a journey.

The start of destiny.

The start, of a **Radical Purpose**.

She really is the sweetest woman and is very strong in her faith. She is not shy to pray over me or with me when I need it. Obviously she’s not perfect, and like anyone, she can get on my nerves a bit, but I genuinely love her and am blessed to have such a great future MIL.

Then, you have my mom. I don’t have the best relationship with her and I am pretty confident she is a narcissist. I’m not just saying that, as I know it’s overused a lot, but I do believe she has all the signs. 

Anyways ever since my fiancé and I have been together, my mom has been insanely jealous of Carla. She constantly makes snide comments about her when I’m around and tries to compete with her. Carla genuinely wants to be best friends with my mom. She has tried so hard to meet for coffee to just hangout. I’m only having one, big bridal shower which my mom is planning, and Carla has asked to help MULTIPLE times and my mom has told her no, then, privately told me that she’s not gonna let Carla do anything for the shower because she will “take it over.”

Today, she asked to see what Carla was wearing to the wedding. Carla is wearing a pretty, deep blue dress. After she asked to see it, I showed my mom a photo. Up until this moment, my mom wanted to wear green (one of our wedding colors). Then my mom proceeded to throw a fit, saying that SHE was going to wear blue. I told her I didn’t really care and they could both wear blue, it’s not an issue. Then, later my mom came up to me to show me the dress she picked out for herself. It was almost exactly like Carla’s dress, except it was far more expensive, which fits since she thinks my Fiancé’s family is poor and doesn’t have quality things. I mean am I being dramatic? Is this not slightly diabolical?

I honestly just don’t know how to get her to stop this behavior. I am absolutely TERRIFIED this will all get worse when grandkids enter the picture, and it makes me want to move far far far away. Any advice is welcome. Feel free to also peep my post history, as this isn’t the first time I’ve had to post about my mom and ask advice. ",0,1739038079.0,Christianmarriage,0,0.5,False

I will stay on 5 mg for the next three months per my doctor’s suggestion. My doctor also suggested that I can spread my shots out if I feel like the medicine is still working. However much I LOVE SHOT DAY, I’m going to listen as I don’t want to titrate up too fast or unnecessarily.

As soon as I started taking the medicine I did a huge overhaul on my diet and health. I only drink water, coffee, and protein shakes. I LOVE Powerade, but when I tried I found it way too sweet for me to drink. I focus on protein for every meal usually eating overnight oats, protein shakes, yogurt, and high protein foods like meat and a veggie or an eggs scramble. 

I have incorporated working out into my daily schedule by waking up around 5:15 to go to the gym to workout before work. I have started strength training MWF and on Saturdays I do a Zumba class. 

Just for context, my highest was 359 before I had weight loss surgery in June 2021. I lost 100 lbs and gained 23 lbs back. I was accustomed to eating smaller portions, but I would still eat around my restriction by endlessly snacking and getting the munchies and ordering McDonald’s at 11:00 pm.

1iktf8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1iktf8l/panama_canal_cruise_review_celebrity_millennium/,Panama Canal cruise review Celebrity Millennium vs Coral Princess,"We just got off the Coral Princess 2 days ago after a 16 night Panama Canal cruise.  We did a nearly identical cruise on the Celebrity Millennium in October 2022.  Thought someone might find a comparison useful. On Celebrity, we are elite plus in loyalty, so we do not pay for a drink pkg or Wi-Fi because we get some of each included.  On Princess, we paid for Princess Plus which included gratuities, drinks, basic Wi-Fi, premium desserts and 2 casual dining lunches each.

1. Food - no comparison, Celebrity was better by far.  
Princess - The food in MDR was bland, dull and although the menu changed, it was variations of the same few things.  The buffet has about 1/5 the variety as Celebrity and it was even worse tasting than MDR. We tried the Salty Dog Gastropub for lunch and although I enjoyed it and the food was very good, my husband was not impressed with the selection.  The premium desserts were huge gelato sundaes and were great, but only once or twice a cruise because they were so rich and decadent.  The I enjoyed the International Cafe.  The coffees were good and they had a selection of snacks which change throughout the day.  It was nice to have a bite with my coffee. The Salty Dog by the pool deck has good burgers with fresh buns and fries, tasty choice for lunch.  The pizza on the deck was fine, but definitely nothing special.  
Celebrity - The food in the MDR was very good and although the menu repeats on a cruise this long, there are still enough choices to get a good selection.  The buffet is large and varied and you can always find something, love the cheese selection.  The pizza is not very good. The burgers on the pool deck are fine, but not as much selection as on Princess and the fries aren’t as good.
2. Entertainment and activities- This was a tie for me. On a cruise this long activities become important.  Both cruises had a great selection and good activities.  Entertainment was also similar; Princess had more going on in the evening, but the theater is much too small for the size of the ship and if you want a seat at either showing, you have to arrive 30-40 minutes early.
3. Staff and service - this was also a tie for me.  Both ships had great crew, friendly, helpful, engaging.  I honestly could not find a complaint with either.
4. Enrichment - Celebrity was a clear winner.  Panama Canal is a historic and engineering achievement and should be presented as such.  Celebrity had both a historian and a Panama Canal expert aboard who each gave several different lectures which were interesting and informative. Princess had their destination expert give one talk and it filled up, so about one third the passengers could attend.  The talk was decent, but it was a one-time thing given by someone who could have googled the information.
5. Wi-Fi was fine on both ships, adequate for our purposes. Love the Princess medallion system and their app is much better than Celebrity’s.  Princess definitely wins the tech category.
6. Staterooms - Celebrity was a clear winner here.  Both staterooms were fine as far as comfort and storage. Where Celebrity excelled was the bathroom.  The shower on Celebrity was at least 1/3 larger with glass doors, while the shower on Princess was small with a crummy shower curtain.  My husband and I are average sized people.  The bathroom floor had water all over every time we showered.  If we were larger, I can’t imagine what the mess would have been. 
7. Overall ship appearance and public spaces - Celebrity was also the winner here.  Both ships are 20+ years old, smaller ships and have been refurbished.  They are both lovely ships, but Celebrity clearly spent more on the refurbishment.  We had been on the Millennium prior to the refurbishment and it was fine.  Now, it is just beautiful with many features of newer ships.  The Coral Princess is also a nice ship, just not as luxurious feeling.
We had a great time on both ships.  If you’re a wine drinker, upgrade your drink package on Princess because the wine on the plus package is pretty bad.  However, if you drink beer or cocktails, the plus package covers it well.  I’m not going to compare ports because they go to many of the same ones and what you do ashore is pretty personal.  Overall, the crew is frequently what makes or breaks a cruise for us and both crews were fantastic.",1,1739037914.0,Cruise,1,1.0,False

Awesome game, they’ve been killing it with these board game adaptations of video games lately. I also have, and greatly enjoy, Dead Cells. I’ve got my eye on the Blasphemous Kickstarter next.

The first act I didn’t know if I was lucky or good. Playing The Silent the only time I lost HP (2 total) was versus Hexaghost. I was able to beat him in 3 rounds. I was overly confident and decided to take the boss relic Coffee Dripper (+1 energy per turn but not allowed to heal at campfires).

To my surprise I was able to beat 1 mob, an elite, and the Act 2 boss (Autamaton) without dying only 1 HP. For the boss I relied heavily on poison an and a thousand cuts. 

Act 3 I avoided a lot of fights (for good or bad) and made it to the boss with 6 HP. The boss, Denu and Deca, went well enough but unfortunately I lost. I defeated Donu but only got Deca down to 24HP before dying.

My energy levels were at rock bottom, and no matter how much coffee I drank, it felt like my brain was running on fumes. I couldn’t focus, couldn’t think clearly, and the fatigue wasn’t just physical—it was mental, emotional, and relentless.

That’s when I found what I now call my secret weapon.

At first, I was skeptical. I’d tried countless supplements promising to fix my low energy, sharpen my focus, or magically help me drop those stubborn pounds. Nothing ever lived up to the hype. But something about this product caught my attention. Maybe it was the science-backed ingredients. Maybe it was the glowing testimonials that felt like they were written by people who’d been exactly where I was. Or maybe it was just desperation. Either way, I decided to give it a shot.

Fast forward three months, and my life has completely transformed.

The first thing I noticed was the energy. Not the jittery, crash-prone energy you get from caffeine or sugary drinks. This was clean, sustained energy that powered me through the day like a finely tuned engine. I woke up feeling refreshed—something I hadn’t experienced in years—and stayed focused and productive from morning until night.

And the mental clarity? Let me tell you, it was like wiping a foggy window clean for the first time. I could think faster, remember details, and tackle complex problems without the overwhelming sense of mental fatigue that used to haunt me. For someone who lives and dies by their ability to perform, this was a game-changer.

Then came the physical changes.

I’d always struggled with weight, especially around my midsection. No matter how much I worked out or tried to eat clean, progress was always slow. But with this product, my metabolism felt like it shifted into high gear. Combined with my renewed energy, hitting the gym didn’t feel like a chore anymore. It felt like an opportunity to push myself further. Within weeks, I started noticing changes in my body. My clothes fit better, the scale started moving in the right direction, and my confidence skyrocketed.

But the best part wasn’t just what I saw in the mirror—it was how I felt inside. There’s a unique kind of happiness that comes from knowing you’re living up to your potential, and for the first time in years, I felt like I was finally back in control.

I know it sounds dramatic, but I can honestly say this product changed my life. It wasn’t some overnight miracle, but it was the missing piece of the puzzle I’d been searching for all along. The natural ingredients, carefully chosen for their ability to support cellular energy, metabolism, and overall health, delivered exactly what they promised—and more.

Now, I’m not one to shout about products from the rooftops. But when something genuinely works, it’s hard not to share it. I went from being skeptical to becoming a believer, not because of flashy marketing or exaggerated claims, but because of results I could see and feel every single day.",1,1739037761.0,OnePlus9Pro,4,1.0,False

I really do love it, but it's going on 4 years old and I don't know how much longer it will last. I know they are not built for longevity, although I feel like I've gotten my money's worth. I bought the Bambino Plus after seeing James Hoffmann's video on the best machines under 500 euros. To be honest, he pretty much nailed it when he said it was a great machine for someone who wanted a satisfying experience making coffee, but didn't want to spend a lot of time investing in their skill set. My husband and I just looked at each other and laughed when he said that. However, that said, I've spent four years now making espresso with it. So I do feel that overall, my skill set is much improved. At the same time, I know myself well enough to know that I still want a relatively easy experience. I know a lot of the people in this forum geek out about the process of making espresso, and I honestly love reading those posts, but it's not me. I also make primarily (although not exclusively) milk-based drinks like cappuccinos and cortados.

I love the aesthetics of the Mara X much more than the Elizabeth. I've watched Hoffmann's video on the best machines under 1500 euros, as well as Lance Hedrick's video on the Mara X. I'm also constrained by space. I don't have much counterspace for a bigger machine, which is one of the reasons the Mara X appeals to me. My grinder is a Niche Zero.

So I guess what I'm asking is, is the Lelit Mara X a relatively easy machine to operate and maintain? I would like to own something that I don't have to worry about replacing when it hits 3-4 years. Maybe my Bambino will last another couple of years, but I have no idea obviously. If nothing else, the idea of junking a machine every 3 to 4 to 5 years is bothersome to me.",1,1739037693.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1iktat4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1iktat4/please_read_help_with_end_of_term_exams/,PLEASE READ! help with end of term exams!!,"Too tired to study, did one exam on Friday and found it so hard to stay awake. I have exams Monday to Friday with the exception of Thursday, averaging two exams a day and I’m mortified at the result I’m going to get particularly in my languages because if you don’t study them you simply won’t have anything to write down but I am too tired. Every time we have a week of exams my body powers down the week or so leading up to them out of pure stress and I hate it because I have to sacrifice my energy for roughly two and a half weeks just to get a few end of term exams done. I’ve had naps, coffees, tablets and everything and I simply cannot stay awake to study and it’s been like this the entire past two weeks.

My family understand and don’t care about my result but I really care about how I’m perceived by my teachers and show them that I am a hardworking student. I try showing it in other ways, like participating in class, being extremely polite to them (as you should anyway, with or without tiredness!) and completing essays to the highest degree possible when I’m given a few days to do so, but unfortunately exams are the most important and I can’t reflect that through tests because of my fatigue. I hate exams for the sole purpose that I know I have the potential to achieve so much more but my narcolepsy holds me back and I cannot stand that thought. 3 years ago this would’ve been a breeze, now my head feels like it’s going to explode. I can feel my eyes in their eye sockets out of sheer tiredness and it’s been like this since mid January with the lead up to these exams.

My teachers understand but they don’t understand fully because well, how could anyone if you don’t have the condition? Do I email them with a heads up? Do I just go in and do a terrible job? Do I apologize? 

I’m in a position where I am trying to spread my knowledge across all subjects. Again, emphasis on my language subjects where I am not great at them anyway and can’t waffle through them.

Language 1 (French)
- Learn relationships with family
- Write about your region/town, tourism etc
- Write about inequality in society 
- Study past tense 
- Reading comprehensions

Language 2
- Summarize a story we have read
- Write about a specific story where you’ve been hit by a car, broke your leg and got an x-Ray (sounds so silly when you write it out like this I know!)
- Learn past tense (completed thankfully!)

And subjects like English, politics, business and geography aswell which I could scrape by in thankfully.

We have already done parts of our test, such as a listening test in both languages, a reading comprehension in my second language, and an English essay on Macbeth. My English essay went well, French and my second language went okay, so I’ve probably gotten 20% done already. 

How do I cope with this? I’m so nervous. Last Friday we only had a maths test, but during the week we will have two tests in one day, so I’ll be in for 5/6 hours. I was so tired during my first exam and that only lasted 3 hours (hour and a half study, hour and a half exam) Advice needed. I can use a laptop to type as accomodation because they understand I have a window of alertness and the laptop gets more work done quicker, so more can be achieved in that window. But I’m feeling so lost. They’re not super important exams by any means as in, if I fail them it won’t be the end of the world, they’re just looking at our work from September-Now but they’re probably the biggest exams we will do this year until our summer exams. I think what I’m scared of the most is coming back into school and the teachers discussing the exams with the class saying ‘some students didn’t study’ although I know it’s probably not aimed at me because they’re aware of my condition, little comments like that when we have small class tests makes my stomach churn. Again, I want to prove to you that I am an excellent student! I cannot do that when you base my success on an exam!!  Do I apologize to my teachers, send out an email? I’m debating it.

If I were to send out an email I would discuss:
- As you know, exams are coming up and my narcolepsy significantly impacts my energy levels and ability to study, which has been made harder with a consistant week of exams
- Assuring them that effort has been put into each subject, including the use of naps and caffeine to stay awake to study for each subject but my fatigue has made it difficult to effectively study all seven subjects and my performance may not reflect my dedication effectively.
- If there are specific areas I need to improve on, let me know and I will be committed to working on them, writing them out and handing them up.
- thanks for the support

Anything else I could add?? Is it silly to email them at all? Is it appropriate? It’s bulletpointed and will be more formal if I were to send it. But I’m not sure, thanks guys.",1,1739037631.0,Narcolepsy,0,1.0,False

I did so by eating higher protein and/or higher volume things and switching to all water and black coffee/tea, as well as doing at least 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise daily (BPM 130-150 throughout) and lifting every other day.

Now I'm at 242 lbs, with a goal weight of 220, maybe 230 (I'm 6'3"", 24M, not a bodybuilder but decently muscular, so it looks like that range would be about 18% fat for me).

But this past month, I've been concerned because my appetite has plummeted.  I'd been shooting for about 3600 calories daily becusse all the online calculators said to, and I was consistently losing 1-2 lbs a week on that diet. 

Well now, I'm struggling to break 2000.  I'm just not hungry, even at meal times.  I've lost 4 lbs a week the past couple weeks, and that was after eating like 2 boxes of Girl Scout cookies yesterday, so looks like it was a good thing I did...  Probably would have been more like 5 or 6 lbs without those because it's like 3000 calories per pound per week, right?

I'm just worried because I'm approaching my goal weight, so my rate of weight loss should be *declining,* right?  It's like my hunger sensors aren't working properly to make me take in as many calories as I need. 

One factor could be depression: I'm about to fail my internship due to not getting enough hours.  But the thing is I usually *over*eat when I'm depressed.  Not having an appetite is not like me at all.  I am a *huge* binge eater, must have been taking in 5000-6000 calories a day when I was 330 lbs.",1,1739037619.0,WeightLossAdvice,0,1.0,False

My diet is as follows:  
chicken (heavy cream, boullion, spices) daily  
eggs in butter daily  
smoothie: whey protein, cocoa powder, cinnamon, coconut oil, milk daily  
chicken liver - around 4 times a week  
broccoli - around 5 times a week  
200ish g of sardines once a week  
less standardized: occasional salads depending on season, cheeses, sometimes ground beef, cured meats

supplementation: vit c,d,k, psillium, creatine, magnesium citrate  
of note is that I eat around 50 to 100 g of mayo per day (sunflower oil)

I also drink coffee, and consume smokeless nicotine

Now my question is more of a micronutrient question, since I know my macros are good, is anything missing from here?

i am finally ready to get my resignation notarized. 

for context my parents became converts 15 years ago and our family grew as we baptized + got sealed. like huge family of 7 now. my parents are pretty much inactive , we have never been super tbm probably the first 7 years and we stopped. my mom has been inactive for nearly 3 years and is a major coffee drinker :) and dad avidly drinks from time to time however has still not lost his “faith and knowledge”
around 17 i started realizing once college started i more than likely didn’t want to continue going mainly because i didn’t enjoy it and always found many things that seemed weird. my mom was understanding when i explained and she reassured me she would always love me whether i was in or out of church. it wasn’t something i needed to.
my dad was very upset his longest desire was one of his kids to serve a mission and stay active in the church but eventually he just accepted that wasn’t going to be me.

fast forward 2 years later i moved from our state to provo to go to uvu, i purposely had no intention of being at byu so i figured all would be well. but the culture shock and amount of tbm never made me feel so terrible as i did. finding community outside of tscc was extremely hard in utah , i at best had 2 exmo roommate who broke bits of my shelf. one was a returned missionary who removed her records introduced me to my first joint, alcohol, parties, planning tattoos and REAL discoveries i never knew about the tscc. it was a good thing for me and by the time i had sat my parents down to let them know i was leaving utah. i had only stayed 9 months but was ready to never return, i was drafting up my resignation letter and sent to tscc didn’t accept it which broke me because i had at that point read the CES letter hoping i could come back to a clean slate. regardless my sister who was super tbm at the time didn’t understand and then confesses to me how that was so hard for her because we were so close. i ignored it and continued being back home without needing to go back to tscc.

my first months back were great because i knew i didn’t have to go anywhere and my mom was not forcing me or my dad at this point. but truly i had a very addictive personality and left utah with depression and anxiety that i pushed aside because i figured it was nothing but i spent most of my stay in utah was being isolated from many things and mentally exhausted + adding that to the homesickness , i just never seeked help. my biggest mistake.
mixing those feelings with a narcissist best friend + addict. didn’t help. i never fully sat with anything and by the end of that year something traumatic happens that leads me to in patient hospitalization for my mental illnesses and substance abuse. i had fit my personal rock bottom and i realized this bc the tscc came to mind and whether god would love me after all i did. it was more about god and myself , questioning “why this had happened” and if i was only a good person bc of tscc. didn’t realize my shelf wasn’t fully done collapsing yet and i would need to do more work.

after my hospitalization, my mom at times blamed herself for what she feared was her fault that these bad experiences happened to me bc she gave “too much freedom” (i later found out my dad said this) my mom is the most amazing and kindest woman i know so not once did it cross my mind , i was an adult that could make my very own choices so no! and my dad of course felt it was my lack of staying active + close to tscc . regardless both my friends that have never been part of tscc, my mom and siblings were all supportive and helped mentally improve and develop healthier habits and meditate. i truly am grateful for how much they helped me come back to myself without involving things i didn’t need. a few months later my sister and i manage to be close as we used to and she tells me about preparing to serve her mission and i although not super excited was ready to support her because i knew she really needed me to be there. the more time i have spent out i realize lots of tbms don’t want know why it is i have so strongly went “inactive”. she invited me to sacrament to catch up with an old friend and see her give a testimony, which i figured it’s only this once so can’t be the end of world (big mistake number 2) i started going to see like wow do i really still connect with this repetitive shit? 


honestly no but i digress i wanted to be supportive of my sister and catch up with a few people i hadn’t seen in a while. but overall the experience of just being a friend was nice. i was going once every few months to just see her or my brother. people had questions about my tattoos and congregation members who swore i moved away. i found it all very funny and honestly i would zone out every sacrament/scroll on my phone actually through exmo reddit :) until one day the bishop gets a hold me and asks me to take up a ysa calling. yes this is exactly where i fucked up , i was on spot bc my sister and brother where there so i said sure. i truly think back why did i just not say anything else? anyway he concludes that i am super social and kind and feels i can bring more ysa closer to christ (he’s a pretty chill bishop but he definitely did that to keep me going i don’t even have an active recommended) the day i was supposed to be “sustained” i purposely left sacrament and missed it, maybe an accident or i just truly it needed to be that way. im not going to lie the only reason the ward ysa isn’t annoying is bc the majority doesn’t go bc they want to , it’s usually all family ties ,many who have told me in conversations they party on weekends, PIMO and just truly seek community. i understand it and it’s what has made the calling easier. 
i figured ill fake this for a few months and finally try to leave but it was becoming harder. 
but a few weeks ago my sister stumbles upon alyssa greenfields instagram videos and she has a million questions. i didn’t know exactly how to answer bc everyone will tell her i am biased since she knows im mentally and physically out. so i sent her lots exmo threads on here, she went down a rabbit hole learns about church history that’s hidden from her, how cult like all the endowment ceremonies are , the handshake, special name and tokens and her shelf is beginning/ along with mine being fully broken. she’s questioning day by day and the only thing that hurts me is that her mission process + told my parents (my dad was the only one who is truly excited my mom not very impressed nor wants her to go) started the week she discovered the videos. she’s still unsure if she wants to go and leave her life here/put off her career when she doesn’t truly believe in the church. she’s trying to find ways of explaining to the bishop that she wants to close her portal (only has had 1 interview)
i recently got asked to a stake calling but i will soon be rejecting and sending in my resignation right after. im DONE! being there knowing only my body is there and i dissociate every-time a scripture is read or “don’t doubt this church” is said! A CULT THATS ALL IT WAS AND ALL IT EVER WILL BE!

thank you to anyone who read this far and thank you to everyone for your stories, your experiences and the amazing knowledge you all have. it’s given me the courage to know i can resign , understand what lies were told to us and that the only things that kept me were comfort it’s not worth it. this has became a community that has helped understand more about myself as well. if you guys do have any advice for my sister please feel free to give it here. she’s still 18 and trying to figure this out without according to our dad “don’t let your sibling influence your thoughts look at how they live” my dad is another story. i just block him out hahaha.

1ikt7ow,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ikt7ow/going_to_give_decaf_another_try/,Going to give decaf another try,"My caffeine story is I started drinking coffee in college. Bad depressive episode a few years into college. Decided to taper off coffee. This was 2017.

I first established my baseline, then took 10% of that amount and removed it every week for ten weeks. This was effortless because I weigh my coffee and brew in aeropress so being consistent was easy. 

My results were mute. I was on the road to recovery from depression already and removing caffeine seemed to neither speed up or slow down that recovery. I had no observable change in my sleep or mood or energy, other than focusing felt slightly harder. 

After about 2 months, I eased back in. 

Ever since then, my rule has been moderation. Whereas when I felt bad effects from caffeine (jittery, stressed, sometimes even nauseous), I was drinking probably 500mg a day. Now I stay in the 100-200 range and I believe it works well for me. 

But I have struggled a bit with energy and focus lately, so I'm going to try again, and try to be open-minded to what I'll experience. Wish me luck!",2,1739037421.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

**Chew Valley Lake, GBQZ Southwest Sector**

“*Wow, they’re really kicking it off now, wasn’t it?*” Sighed Elbe as she watched several Apache attack helicopters taking off from the deck of Bataan and Independence while she took a sip of coffee provided to her by Jade.

“*Eh, like we don’t have something just as flashy on us.*” Her sister spoke, pointing her face at the battery of M142 HIMARS parked on top of their ship. Part of the preparation of this mission involves deploying four light carriers, Elbe, Jade, Bataan and Independence several days earlier to help support the ground operation. Chew Valley Lake was chosen as it the largest body of water close to Larkhill that was big enough to allow four ships to be deployed there, as well as deep enough to keep the Infected from reaching them. They were dropped here ahead of everyone and then equipment, supplies and support crews were airlifted to them essentially converting them into a floating support platform. While Bataan and Independence were tasked to resupply the attack helicopters, Jade and Elbe were to be used as a launch platform for the HIMARS.

Personally, Elbe wondered if placing the HIMARS so close to the area of operation is a credible idea. On paper, the rocket artillery system had enough range to hit Larkhill without even leaving Isle of Wight. But she was told that NATO needed an artillery support that could hit their targets as soon as a strike was called in, and here she was looking at four of them parked on her deck, another four is on Jade making it a total of eight HIMARS being used for the operation. Just earlier one of them had opened fire on a distant target and now support crews are working on reloading it. As Elbe watched the process, her communicator picked up Winfried’s voice as he was addressing the other girls on the plane.

“*Girls, do you hear me?*” He spoke.

“*Yes Kommandant, we heard you loud and clear.*” Z23 answered.

“*Good, listen. Once you’re on the ground, deploy your riggings and regroup quickly with the soldiers. For those with separate rigging like Roon and Heinrich, wait until it is safe to summon them. Until then just use your firearms provided to you. Am I clear?*”

“*Ja.*” Roon replied.

“*Very well. Now here’s another information I have to disclose. This was about your neck guards you all are wearing.”* There was a pause before Winfried continued. *“I was told that the neck guards contained explosives and each of us and NATO have a finger on the trigger.*” Elbe could feel goosebumps from what Winfried was telling. No doubt after all that happened in London, neither NATO or Azur Lane was in the mode for another repeat of The Breach

“*NATO told me should any of you got infected, either we or Gayle will detonate it, and if it all fails there’s a cruise missile ready to be fired at you. So please avoid unnecessary risks.*”

“*Understood, Kommandant. Strasse out.*” After hearing the last transmission, Elbe took another sip of coffee as she stares at the formation of Apache helicopters heading eastwards towards Larkhill.

“*Good luck everyone.*” She quietly prayed.

**Damn, writing a new chapter seems a bit longer than what I thought. But then again, my job really was eating into me. It’s been a while since I started writing Outbreak. The first chapter was written in 2021; when 2024, the year the story took place in was still a distant year. Now we’re in 2025 and boy oh boy was the real 2024 was an absolute shocker which is one of the reasons why writing this chapter was challenging as maintaining balance between reality and fiction was monumental. Then again, Outbreak’s storyline was made prior to 2022 and given the premises set in by the story, it probably would be weird to see Russia as an ally but here in this fic, Russia was more or less a neutral party through the Azur Lane so NATO can request their shipgirls for help. But obviously Russia would not simply lend their shipgirls without attaching a few baggage to them; exactly what they’re planning will be revealed in the next chapter.**

**Speaking of it, this chapter was supposed to be longer but upon the advice of a friend, I decided to cut it and move them to the next chapter, which also allows me to formally introduce the two other factions of the Azur Lane that so far were only mentioned but were yet to appear in person.**

**And more importantly, this year will saw the release of 28 Years Later, so obviously Outbreak will be in a bigger spotlight and as such I would try to release as many chapters as I can this year. For that, I may require more proofreaders to help guide me through. If you’re interested, look up war4sure on Discord and message me.**

I give them a pound of scratch every morning scattered out on the ground (one drink cup full ) between the ten birds and I’m pretty sure the squirrels get the leftovers.

We had a really good time until about 2am. I am a very self aware person so even when I’m ridiculously drunk, I can recognize when my mental is off. I was staring into the fire pit that a bunch of people threw together outside and the feeling of loneliness hit me. I associated it with a relationship that didn’t work out. I told my friends that I was thinking of her and that I needed to do something else. We danced for a while but his phone died so we decided to head out. 

When we did, we encountered a girl who was beyond wasted. She was throwing off her belongings like her glasses, ID, and jacket in the middle of the street and crying. We are both very sensitive to those kinds of things so we helped her out. We were especially nervous because the rave was in a not great part of town and she was getting close to where a well known chop shop is. We were about to find out where her sister was so she could be safe. 

When we started walking back towards the car again, I told my friend that I felt bad because dealing with that girl made me feel better. It made me feel better because I didn’t have to think about the relationship that didn’t work out. At this pain we were in the car and driving out of the parking lot. This is when my friend absolutely dragged me for filth. He clocked me 100% and I wasn’t mad just very sad that I had let myself get this far mentally. He told me that I always have put people first and ignore my own needs. That I’m always looking out for others and caring about how they feel but not caring about how I feel. He’s known me for about 8 years or so and pointed out that since he’s known me, I’ve never really cried or dealt with my own emotions because it was always expected of me from everyone else to tend to them first. The entire time there were tears streaming down my face. The car ride was half an hour long and he dragged me the entire time. When we got into our part of town, he noticed I was crying (I’m not a loud crier) and held my hand. He told me it was okay and I just lost it. 

I realized he was entirely right and spilled my guts, telling him eventually that I have felt lonely my entire life. There could be 1,000 in the same room as me and I’d still feel lonely. It’s always felt like no one cared and if they did, they only cared for a second and would then proceed to tell me all of their trauma, expecting advice. I told him I love my friends and my family but I’m just so angry at them. Why can no one ever put me first. For the first time in a while, my mask came off and I shed my skin. Before he left he told me that I needed to learn to be more selfish and put myself first. He ended with saying, he just wanted me to know that i never had to try and be strong around him. That I could let it out. And that’s all I needed. I just needed someone to acknowledge me. Today I woke up and all I wanted was a coffee and to work on my music. And that’s exactly what I plan to do when I’m done writing this. I’m not sure how to proceed after that with everything that happened last night but I guess I’m gonna try to figure out how to put myself first.",2,1739037014.0,venting,1,1.0,False

1iksxzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1iksxzr/advice_on_how_to_deal_with_a_covert_narcissist/,Advice on how to deal with a covert narcissist,"Hi! I’m an adult with c-ptsd as a result of growing up with a parent with narcissistic tendencies who ended up with a partner who was a covert narcissist and sadist. The other parent was emotionally unavailable in many ways, an enabler, and a codependent type of person. 

I’ve been in IFS therapy for years and have done some EMDR but I am still at a loss sometimes on how to deal with people who are narcissistic. I find myself sometimes drawn to them or vice versa and it’s taken me a long time to realize people I have tricky relationships with are often communal narcissists or covert etc. 

There’s a parent at my child’s school that I have had trouble with.. it took me about 3 years to realize what she is because I hadn’t learned enough to spot it. She seemed always willing to help and often like a martyr.. which began to remind me of my stepmother. More and more she did things that were similar! I finally realized it after I allowed my daughter go to a sleepover at this woman’s house. I really regretted it after and since then I’ve tried to use the gray rock technique with her. 

I thought it was working- she’s mostly stayed away but recently I had this intense time in my life.. I had a miscarriage that ended in a medical emergency where I could’ve died. I have reached out to my community for help but along the way this narcissistic mom found out what happened to me. 

Even though we haven’t interacted much over the last school year she sent me this long text about how she wanted to make me a meal or help with my kids. I wrote back a short message saying thanks etc without accepting and thought it was over but then I got another long message last night from her. It was another short offer for help and then this long thing about how we had to smooth things over from when the last upsetting thing happened with her and would I like to get coffee soon?

I don’t want to write back at all and I’m not sure if that’s the answer. I’m worried she’ll keep going and because of what happened with my stepmother I have parts of me trying to anticipate what she’ll do next. My feeling is she’ll get very upset because her kid isn’t invited to my daughter’s upcoming birthday party (because they aren’t friends) and she will blame it on me trying to get back at her.

I’d really love to hear stories from other women about how you kept friends over the years, taking girls trips, doing life together. 

I have a handful of friends I keep in touch with mostly via message or mail but I really want some close friends to do stuff with - shopping, going to the gym, getting iced coffee, etc. I really miss that!! 

I feel like I’ve looked to men/partners for friendship and then when the dating relationship ends I have very little support or outside friends.

1ikswb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/1ikswb9/tomtyoutube_channel_an_educational_youtube/,[TOMT][YOUTUBE CHANNEL] An educational youtube channel hosted by a guy called Steven or Stephan,"he was bald. 

Stephan/Steven didn't own the channel or the show, but he hosted it. He'd sit in a swivelly chair ( i think ) and drink like coffee or something. he was usually to the right or left of the screen, and which ever side he didn't occupy there would be graphics

i thought the channel name was something along the lines of 'you should now' or 'smarter every day' (which are different channels), but i'm pretty sure the host (stephan/steven) would say it at the start and open each episode like 'here's a fact you should know' and that was like, the name of the channel/of the show.

he would give facts (which i think might've been viewer suggested, or whatever the researchers for the show found interesting) and answer viewer questions and I'm pretty sure it was a daily thing too, like a 'morning show' kind of thing

thank you in advance to anyone who can help me find this bald man who had such a soothing voice !!

he spoke kinda posh, and had glasses

Hi folks, I'm immensely grateful for this thread and this community of good people who just want RELIEF and are willing to share incredible information on their healing journeys. 

I am only 25 yrs old but have been struggling with IBS-C/slow motility for 10+ years. It has gotten much worse in the past 2 years, with constant bloating no matter what I eat and even when I wake up without food. I have a bowel movement in the mornings but only after coffee, and I still feel incomplete. I was seeing a highly respected GI doctor in NYC for 1.5 years (others here have seen her), who did several tests and prescribed me doxy twice for my SIBO. Ultimately she said I am chronically constipated and dysbiosis. I've been doing pelvic floor PT for a while and am told I am doing well on that front. I have also been taking Motegrity (a prokinetic) since May, which has only helped trigger a BM but has not helped evacuate me. I  have had my bloodwork tested too -- everything looks good except my T3 and ferratin levels are slightly low. So the GI wanted me to try a thyroid medication, which freaked me out because again...I'm only 25. But maybe the thyroid is playing a role in all this...who knows. My T3 levels were normal only a few years ago and I was still dealing with constipation.

I then got a 2nd opinion with a functional medicine doctor at Weill Cornell who I was referred to by my PT (others on this thread have seen him too). He recommended that I don't take the thyroid medication. He takes much more of a ""natural"" approach -- wants me to have warm, mushy foods; do abdominal massages; take powders; eat prunes, etc etc. I take magnesium citrate, triphala powder,every night, and still I am backed up. This doctor doesn't want to prescribe antibiotics for my SIBO, but wants me to do all the lifestyle changes before trying an herbal protocol (biocydin, I believe). 

I am frustrated because I have followed these doctors' orders -- both of whom take very different approaches -- and I am getting worse. My bloating and constipation are out of control. I want to get a 3rd opinion from another doctor in NYC, but I find that it seems like there are few people who really know how to get to the root cause AND have good bedside manner. I just want someone who gets it and can really give me relief. ",2,1739036611.0,SIBO,0,1.0,False

My energy levels were at rock bottom, and no matter how much coffee I drank, it felt like my brain was running on fumes. I couldn’t focus, couldn’t think clearly, and the fatigue wasn’t just physical—it was mental, emotional, and relentless.

That’s when I found what I now call my secret weapon.

At first, I was skeptical. I’d tried countless supplements promising to fix my low energy, sharpen my focus, or magically help me drop those stubborn pounds. Nothing ever lived up to the hype. But something about this product caught my attention. Maybe it was the science-backed ingredients. Maybe it was the glowing testimonials that felt like they were written by people who’d been exactly where I was. Or maybe it was just desperation. Either way, I decided to give it a shot.

Fast forward three months, and my life has completely transformed.

The first thing I noticed was the energy. Not the jittery, crash-prone energy you get from caffeine or sugary drinks. This was clean, sustained energy that powered me through the day like a finely tuned engine. I woke up feeling refreshed—something I hadn’t experienced in years—and stayed focused and productive from morning until night.

And the mental clarity? Let me tell you, it was like wiping a foggy window clean for the first time. I could think faster, remember details, and tackle complex problems without the overwhelming sense of mental fatigue that used to haunt me. For someone who lives and dies by their ability to perform, this was a game-changer.

Then came the physical changes.

I’d always struggled with weight, especially around my midsection. No matter how much I worked out or tried to eat clean, progress was always slow. But with this product, my metabolism felt like it shifted into high gear. Combined with my renewed energy, hitting the gym didn’t feel like a chore anymore. It felt like an opportunity to push myself further. Within weeks, I started noticing changes in my body. My clothes fit better, the scale started moving in the right direction, and my confidence skyrocketed.

But the best part wasn’t just what I saw in the mirror—it was how I felt inside. There’s a unique kind of happiness that comes from knowing you’re living up to your potential, and for the first time in years, I felt like I was finally back in control.

I know it sounds dramatic, but I can honestly say this product changed my life. It wasn’t some overnight miracle, but it was the missing piece of the puzzle I’d been searching for all along. The natural ingredients, carefully chosen for their ability to support cellular energy, metabolism, and overall health, delivered exactly what they promised—and more.

Now, I’m not one to shout about products from the rooftops. But when something genuinely works, it’s hard not to share it. I went from being skeptical to becoming a believer, not because of flashy marketing or exaggerated claims, but because of results I could see and feel every single day.

Nadine used to ghost me during tough talks. Example: I’d say, “I feel disconnected,” and she’d walk away or go silent for days. I’d get so mad — like she didn’t care enough to fight for us. Meanwhile, she felt overwhelmed and scared of arguments. We became pros at silent treatments.  

I thought her ghosting meant she didn’t love me. She thought my anger meant I’d never understand her. We slept in the same bed but felt oceans apart.  

I stopped chasing her during fights. When she’d shut down, I used to push harder: “Why won’t you talk to me?!” Big mistake. Now I say, “I’ll be in the garage when you’re ready.” Giving her space \*without drama\* helped her open up faster.  

I learned to appreciate her quiet strengths. Nadine wasn't the “dinner-making, always-organized” wife. But she was the mom who stays up late helping kids with art projects, and the woman who remembers exactly how I liked my coffee. I started telling her: “I see how hard you work for us.”  

Small gestures rebuild bridges. When she ghosted, I left her some small notes —just “I’m here.”  It breaks the tension.  

We created “safe words.” If Nadine starts shutting down, she says, “I need 1 hour.” If I’m getting angry, I say, “I’m overheating.” It sounds silly, but it works.  

Sex? We started SLOW. After years of no intimacy, we began with non-sexual touch: brushing hands while cooking, 10-second hugs, or foot rubs while watching TV. No pressure—just reconnecting.  

Ghosting doesn’t mean your partner doesn’t care. Sometimes they care too much and don’t know how to cope. It took us 12 years to break this cycle. Now? We still argue—but she stays in the room.  



Hope that helps!

Cheers

Niels



Btw you can ask ask us anything:

\- How to stay calm when your partner shuts down.  

\- How to rebuild trust after silent treatments.  

\- How to stop resenting each other’s flaws.

1ikss24,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTableCentral/comments/1ikss24/cubicubi_tslj32g_computer_desk_review_a_compact/,CubiCubi TS-LJ-32G computer desk review: a compact and stylish solution for small spaces,"I’ve been using the CubiCubi TS-LJ-32G computer desk for a few weeks now, and it’s become an essential part of my home office setup. With its modern, minimalist design and compact dimensions, this desk is perfect for anyone working in tight spaces like apartments, dorm rooms, or small bedrooms. It’s not just about looks—this desk brings a great balance of style, functionality, and sturdiness to the table (pun intended).

The design immediately caught my eye. The wood-finish top paired with the alloy steel frame exudes a modern and elegant vibe that fits seamlessly with my existing decor. Its laminate finish ensures the surface is both scratch-resistant and easy to clean. Spilling coffee during a late-night work session? Wiped it right off without a trace! The X-shaped cross-bar at the back adds to the structural stability, and the adjustable leg pads keep it steady even on uneven flooring.

Moving on to size, it’s clear this desk was designed with practicality in mind. Measuring 31.5 inches in width and 15.75 inches deep, it offers just enough room for a laptop, a notebook, and maybe a small plant to keep things cheerful. The 28.74-inch height is ideal for legroom, and I’ve found it comfortable for extended work sessions. It’s not the kind of desk you’d use for a dual-monitor gaming setup, but for light tasks, it’s more than sufficient.

[Check CubiCubi TS-LJ-32G price on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/product/cubicubi-ts-lj-32g-review-with-model-b08bxv817c/)

One of the standout features is how easy it was to assemble. I’m not exactly a DIY expert, but the instructions were straightforward, and all the tools were included in the box. It took me about 20 minutes from start to finish, and I didn’t face any issues with misaligned parts or confusing steps. In fact, my niece even helped me with it—it’s that simple.

The desk’s functionality is where it truly shines. While it doesn’t come with excessive bells and whistles, it does its job well. There’s no built-in storage or drawers, so if you’re someone who needs space for files or peripherals, you’ll need to think about additional storage solutions. However, the minimalist design allows for a clutter-free workspace, which is a big plus for me.

**Pros**:

1. Stylish and modern design that complements various decor styles.
2. Compact size, making it perfect for small spaces.
3. Scratch-resistant and easy-to-clean surface.
4. Sturdy alloy steel frame with excellent stability.
5. Quick and hassle-free assembly.

**Cons**:

1. Limited workspace; not ideal for larger setups like dual monitors.
2. Lack of built-in storage options or extra features.
3. The lightweight construction might feel a bit flimsy to some.

Comparing this desk to competitors like the SHW Home Office Desk or the GreenForest Folding Desk, I find the CubiCubi TS-LJ-32G holds its own in terms of design and ease of assembly. The SHW desk often comes with cable management options that this one lacks, but it doesn’t quite match CubiCubi’s aesthetic appeal. Meanwhile, the GreenForest desk is foldable, which is convenient for portability, but it sacrifices some sturdiness compared to the CubiCubi.

In terms of cost, this desk is competitively priced. While you can find cheaper options, the quality and design make it a worthwhile investment. It’s a fantastic choice for anyone on a budget who still wants a desk that looks good and performs reliably.

After testing all the features, I’m particularly impressed by the reinforced frame design. The diagonal brace ensures the desk doesn’t wobble, even when I’m typing away furiously during a heated work session. However, the lack of additional features, like a drawer or cable management, might be a dealbreaker for some.

This isn’t just another city map. This is a living, breathing urban sprawl designed to make your players feel like they’ve truly stepped into the neon-lit chaos of the Dark Future.

**What’s Inside?**  
300+ Points of Interest – From neon-drenched combat zones to abandoned corpo labs, every corner of this map has something to discover. No dead zones. No wasted space. Every alley, every block tells a story.

**Designed for Maximum Player Freedom**  
Whether your crew is looking for work, hunting a mark, or just trying to stay alive, this map gives GMs the tools to make every street feel alive. Drop a fixer job, stage a shootout, or let the players explore—it’s all here.

**Why I Made This**  
Cyberpunk has always been more than just a genre—it’s a vibe. I wanted a map that wasn’t just a set piece but a narrative engine, something that GMs could use to tell unforgettable stories. A place where players could get lost in the world, where every building has a purpose, and where the city itself feels like a character.

After 80+ hours of pouring my time and soul into this, I’d love nothing more than for the community to use it, tweak it, expand on it, and most importantly—make some damn good stories with it.

If you end up using this, drop a comment! I’d love to hear how your crew interacts with the city, what kind of chaos they stir up, and what homebrew elements you might add to it. See you in the streets, chooms!

My symptoms: heartburn/reflux, LPR, excess saliva, excess burping, and nausea. 

I'm avoiding acidic foods, coffee, chocolate, alcohol, and processed fatty foods like bacon and french fries. 

The doctor gave me a prescription for questran powder, which will hopefully help. But I was wondering if you guys have any suggestions on what I can do diet/supplement wise to recover from this.

For direct to consumer, we offer quantity discounts on bulk pricing. For B2B, we put together a custom package and present and then close the customer generally hoping they become repeat business. B2B also receives a lower price, almost near wholesale because they are purchasing large amounts. 

Things get a little bit more complicated because we sell a customized product. So companies can add their branded color and logo. (We do all the customization, so apps that offer that service are of no use to us)

I'm *fairly* clear how to integrate customized product purchasing for the consumer level, most likely with an existing app (Any recommendations would be amazing) or some customization. 

Where I start to get cloudy is how can I use Shopify to configure, price and quote larger B2B customers and still leaning on Shopify for product data? In a perfect world, Shopify would be able to build a package,  quote, and then process the order.  Ideally I would like to use Shopify as the product master because of it's reporting capabilities, it's community of custom app builders, etc.  

Do I use a separate app to sell B2B contracts and just pull Shopify data? Do I customize something that's already out there? Pandadoc is one i explored or do I need to use Shopify B2b?

Hey, my name is Julia. I'm new to the area and don't know anyone here, so I'm looking for friends.

I love animals and art especially! I love going to art galleries and zoos. I do love games (PC) however I don't play often at the moment. I have tattoos and colourful hair, quite on the alternative side. My favourite bands would be along the lines of BMTH, Architects - anything similar to those!

If anyone is a similar age and has the same interests, send me a message and maybe we could go for a coffee or a park? I'm pretty awkward at first, apologies 😅",1,1739035711.0,MakeFriendsUK,0,1.0,False

We met on Tik Tok a year ago, my gf 30, and I 34m talked daily for months. Then she ghosted me…assuming because she was in a relationship. 

The  2 months ago she reached out and we started talking again. The best thing is that she actually lives in my city. Went for a coffee and we just clicked.  She is a very private person because she doesn’t like it when people she doesn’t know, knows everything about her. 

The point is, last night we talked a range of subjects, including how she would like to keep our relationship private in the sense where friends don’t know everything(hope that makes sense). The one part I will have to get used to is the sex, it’s great don’t get my wrong, but she does not want to use the birth control pill or a IUD due to bad experiences in the past. She only wants to use condoms. For the record  I am totally okay with that. 

My past relationships usually started out with the condoms because they usually were just starting the pill again  at the time or didn’t have a IUD but after 2 months we moved away from condoms. 

My question is, is this common for  couples  to just use condoms as a form of birth control? 

I am asking since this is new to me and didn’t have this issue with past relationships",1,1739035684.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

I didn't have a linear path like everyone else - school, uni, outings, career and onwards.

I had enough days where I have been depressed beyong repair. I had to do a lot of healing just to reach a normal state of mind. I don't have depression anymore, and I have started feeling great.

I'm 21 now, I will start university this year studying mathematics. I have a girl in my life who's understanding and supportive, it's long distance right now, I'll be with her soon though.

I'm glad and grateful to have the freedom to feel raindrops down my cheeks and fresh wind blowing through my face. I'm glad to have the freedom to read a good book, I'm glad to have the freedom to pet a dog, I'm glad to have the freedom to enjoy a warm cup of coffee, I'm glad to have freedom to walk in the local park, I'm glad to have the freedom to smile at strangers, I'm glad to have the freedom to help people in need, I'm glad to have the freedom to walk on a hill surrounded by lush trees.

I had ramen, croissant, some dry fruits and half a guava for breakfast. It was blissful.

I recently moved and I’m planning to complete my kitchen with a good espresso setup. The issue is, I’ve been researching machines for the last week and I’m in deep decision paralysis. 

I narrowed my options down to two machines, the ones included in the title. I’m open to alternatives as well, but a lot of stuff I’ve seen recommended on YouTube or Reddit is unfortunately not available where I live, and international shipping is very expensive here due to tariffs (I live in Turkey if that’s relevant).

I know the Gaggia is the better machine, but there’s a price difference of around $200, so I’m wondering if the difference is worth it. I have a Timemore C3 Pro that I’m planning to use, and I know that’s not a great grinder for espresso, so I don’t want to spend the extra money if my grinder will limit the quality of my brews anyway. 

In addition, I’m wondering if a pressurised basket would be better for me, since my grinder isn’t really geared towards espresso. If not, I’m ok with spending some extra money to get a good regular basket. 

So, which machine would you recommend? Doesn’t have to be one of the two I mentioned, but I’d appreciate recommendations from brands that tend to be globally available. Also, would love advice on which type of basket to use. Thank you for reading the long post, and hope you have a great day!

High school sweethearts kami and sobrang nakaka proud na gumraduate kami ng college ng sabay and nagwowork na ngayon. Ang okay na ng relationship namin, kumbaga settle nalang ang kulang which is plan ko na talaga, nagiipon lang.

Na di nya nako babalikan and di na siya makikipag ayos. Ngayon, tinanong ko siya kung anong reason nya. Alam ko sa sarili ko na never kami magkakaroon ng 3rd party, kahit na seloso ako. May times na tinatanong ko siya about sa guys na nakakasalamuha nya or what, pero once na sinabi nyang friend lang or kawork, oks nako don. Ganon din siya sakin. Tiwala kami sa isat isa. Pero dahil ang bigat ng feeling ko this time, tinanong ko parin kahit alam kong di yun yung rason, for peace of mind lang kumbaga. Sabi nya di daw, wala daw. Ang reason nya is yung reason nya rin before, gusto nya maging independent, magfocus sa sarili., and gusto nyang maintindihan ko yon at wag na siyang habulin. Yun yung goal nya kanina. Nung sinabi nya yun, naisip ko na walanna talaga atang chance to, lalo nung sinabi nyang buo na ang loob nya. Ang sabi ko lang naiintindihan ko yung desisyon nya, kahit na sa loob loob ko gusto ko maging selfish at makipag ayos sa kanya kahit pa mag iiyak ako sa place na pinaguusapan namin which is coffee shop.

Just the name itself sent shivers down my spine, a symphony of excitement and nerves. We met at a coffee shop, a cliché I know, but the way his eyes lit up when he laughed at my terrible joke about the wifi password... it was electric.
He was everything I wasn't. Bold, outgoing, with a smile that could melt glaciers. Me? I was the quiet observer, the girl in the corner with her nose in a book. Yet, he saw something in me, something that made him linger, made him want to know more.
Our first date was a disaster. We went to a museum, and I tripped over a velvet rope, sending a priceless vase teetering precariously. Thankfully, it didn't fall, but my face burned crimson with embarrassment. Jahmal, ever the charmer, just laughed and said, ""Well, that was exciting!""
Somehow, the disaster date broke the ice. We spent the rest of the day wandering through the city, talking about everything and nothing. He listened to my rambling theories about ancient civilizations with genuine interest, and I found myself captivated by his passion for photography.
As the weeks turned into months, our connection deepened. We explored hidden corners of the city, shared secrets whispered in the dark, and discovered a love for old movies and bad karaoke. He challenged me to step outside my comfort zone, to embrace life with open arms. And I, in turn, encouraged him to pursue his dreams, to believe in himself.
Jahmal was my first real love, the one who showed me the world in vibrant colors. He taught me the meaning of vulnerability, the power of connection, and the joy of simply being myself. Even though our paths eventually diverged, the memories we created, the love we shared, will forever hold a special place in my heart.

Its compact design immediately stood out, fitting snugly on my counter without hogging space. The black finish, combined with stainless steel accents, adds a modern touch, and the lightweight build makes it easy to move around. But aesthetics aside, how did it actually perform in daily use?

The build quality feels solid, though the lid's tiny plastic legs could use an upgrade in durability. I encountered a few comments where users mentioned these parts breaking, which could render the machine unusable. As someone who has been clumsy with lids before, this is something I’ll have to keep an eye on. Still, I admired how the removable stainless steel cups made cleaning a breeze—dishwasher-safe features are always a win in my book!

Grinding performance was, for the most part, impressive. I tested the grinder with coffee beans, dried spices, and even some nuts, achieving fine, consistent results. However, it does seem to struggle with certain wet ingredients, such as garlic or ginger. The motor is powerful, clocking in at 20,000–24,000 RPM, which ensures rapid grinding within 8–15 seconds, but I found that larger chunks sometimes remained when dealing with wet mixtures. That said, for dry ingredients, this thing is a beast, grinding to powdery perfection.

The mechanism relies on blades rather than burrs, which could be a drawback for hardcore coffee enthusiasts who seek the ultimate precision in grind uniformity. While the SHARDOR grinder does a decent job, burr grinders are known for providing more consistent results. However, for the average user who doesn’t require barista-level precision, this is a solid option.

Simplicity defines its usability. With a single push-to-grind lid, there are no confusing dials or settings to mess with, making this grinder incredibly beginner-friendly. Timing your grind is key here—press for longer to achieve finer textures. The addition of two interchangeable cups, one for dry and one for wet grinding, adds to its versatility. Whether I needed to grind coffee beans for a morning brew or prep spices for dinner, switching between tasks was seamless.

One area where the grinder shines is its capacity. The cups are generously sized compared to typical grinders, holding enough for multiple servings in one go. Speed was another highlight; quick grinding ensured I wasn’t stuck waiting, even during hectic mornings. This efficiency is especially useful when preparing spice blends or grinding grains for recipes.

**Pros**

* Compact and stylish design that fits any kitchen.
* Powerful motor ensures rapid grinding for dry ingredients.
* Dishwasher-safe, removable stainless steel cups simplify cleaning.
* Versatile for various uses: coffee, spices, nuts, and more.
* Affordable compared to more advanced grinders.

**Cons**

* Wet grinding isn’t as effective, leaving uneven textures.
* Blade mechanism lacks the precision of burr grinders.
* Fragile lid components prone to breaking.
* Struggles with larger, tougher ingredients like whole spices.
* Can be slightly noisy during use.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Comparing this to similar models like the Cuisinart Electric Grinder and the Hamilton Beach Fresh Grind, the SHARDOR excels in versatility. The inclusion of two cups (wet and dry) sets it apart from competitors that often only focus on coffee grinding. However, in terms of grind consistency for coffee, the Cuisinart burr grinder delivers better precision. Meanwhile, Hamilton Beach offers a quieter operation, though its grinding speed lags behind SHARDOR’s efficiency. If versatility is a top priority, SHARDOR is the better choice, but for purists focused solely on coffee grinding, a burr grinder might be worth considering.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

Though I can’t provide an exact price, the SHARDOR CG-618-SHARDOR electric grinder sits comfortably in the mid-range of kitchen appliances. Given its multipurpose functionality—working as a coffee grinder, spice mill, and even a mini food processor—it offers great value. For households that frequently grind different ingredients, this saves the cost of buying separate tools. However, if your primary need is for wet grinding or premium coffee grinding, it might be worth investing in more specialized equipment.

The grinder comes packed with thoughtful features like a 2-in-1 coffee spoon with a brush for easy cleaning and a 2-year warranty. This warranty is a reassuring touch, especially given the occasional fragility of its lid components. Customer service also seems responsive, as some users mentioned receiving replacement parts quickly when issues arose.

I'm single but trying to date. Ako nalang kasama niya and she retired from her job a few years ago. She's in her 60s.

I'm forever grateful na tinaguyod niya kaming magkapatid para mabuhay at makapagtapos. I appreciate everything mom. Naaawa akong iwan kayo mag isa. But sometimes it's frustrating na I'm still being treated like a child. 

I've been trying find my special someone for awhile now and I recently met someone that I really like and shares the same interests as me. We've been vocal about how we like each other. Fast forward last Feb 1st and we decided to go out on our first date. I did inform my mom about it and said i'd be home late and she said okay. So me and the girl went out and ate at a resto, tumambay din sa coffee shop while talking about anything under the sun. It was really going well. Then came the evening and we wanted to spend more time sana with each other. Tatambay lang sa park. Then here comes my mom sending me messages ""Sino kasama mo?"", ""San kana?"", ""Uwi na"" despite informing her na I'd go meet someone and uuwi akong late.

We still continued na tumambay sa park and magkwentuhan despite my mom bombarding me messages. I told her I'm still at the park and told her again na late ako makakauwi. Eventually me and my date decided to go home na since it's late narin. 

Once I got home, my mom is acting weird and pissed. Kinakausap ko siya ng maayos like kinakamusta ko siya kaso pabalang siya sumagot or she doesn't answer at all. Wala naman ako ginawang masama pero why the hell is she acting pissed. Before I went out, I did all my chores. I cleaned the house, feed the dog, watered the plants etc. And no, hindi ako palamunin. I have a job and I work remotely so that I can accompany her. I fuckin don't see any reason for her to be pissed except me going on a date and going home late. I know this since I went home late nung highschool pa ko and she was acting the same as now.

I'm 31 already. I fuckin remember how my mom and my relatives kept pressuring me to find a girlfriend which made me hate family gatherings. Now that I'm trying, she's acting pissed. Being treated like a fuckin highschooler. I also want to have my own family one day that's why I am dating and hopefully find my forever. Pero it seems like you are against it with what you are showing. Gusto niyo nalang ata ako gawing caregiver.

As someone who often struggles with low energy during gloomy seasons, I was eager to see if this product could live up to its claims. It’s marketed as a light and ion therapy device, combining 10,000 lux of UV-free light with negative ion generation to simulate a sunny day and elevate mood. Here’s my breakdown of its performance and whether it’s worth adding to your daily routine.

**Design & Build Quality**

Right out of the box, the design caught my attention. The SunTouch Plus is compact and lightweight, weighing just about a pound. It’s made of durable plastic and has a simple upright design that fits seamlessly on a desk or nightstand. I found it sturdy but not overly bulky, making it easy to move from one room to another. However, the material does feel a bit on the cheaper side, and I wonder how well it will hold up after extended use.

Check [SunTouch Plus F40-40 Light Therapy price on Amazon](https://agegene.com/product/suntouch-plus-f40-40-light-therapy-review-b000w8y7fy/).

**Light Intensity & Settings**

The device emits a 10,000 lux brightness level, mimicking natural sunlight. I was a bit skeptical at first, but after using it during my morning coffee, I genuinely felt more awake and focused. You can adjust the timer to 15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes, which is a helpful feature for someone like me who forgets to turn things off. The light is bright but doesn’t feel harsh. However, it might be too intense for anyone with sensitive eyes, so keeping it at a reasonable distance is a good idea.

**Color Temperature & Spectrum**

The SunTouch Plus operates with a blue-enriched white light at 17,000 Kelvin. It’s designed to mimic the light of a clear blue sky, and I must admit, it’s quite soothing. Unlike some other devices I’ve tried, this one didn’t give me a headache or strain my eyes. There’s no flicker, which is a big plus for comfort and usability over longer periods.

**Ease of Use**

Operating this device is as straightforward as it gets. The controls are placed conveniently on the side, allowing you to set your desired time and activate the ionizer with ease. There’s no complicated setup, so even someone who’s not tech-savvy can figure it out in minutes. That said, the power cord is a bit short, which could be an inconvenience depending on where you plan to use it.

**Portability & Size**

Its compact dimensions (9 x 6 x 13 inches) and lightweight design make it easy to move around. I tested it in different spots around my home, from my desk to my bedside table, and it fit nicely in all these places. However, a carrying case or dust cover would have been a thoughtful addition, considering it’s something you might want to keep clean and portable.

**Safety & Eye Comfort**

One of my biggest concerns with light therapy devices is safety, and the SunTouch Plus doesn’t disappoint. It’s UV-free and certified safe for the eyes, which provided some peace of mind. I didn’t experience any discomfort or dryness after using it daily. However, as I mentioned earlier, the brightness might be overwhelming for some users, so it’s best to start with shorter sessions.

**Pros**

* High-intensity 10,000 lux light effectively mimics natural sunlight.
* Built-in timer with multiple settings (15 to 60 minutes) for customization.
* Lightweight and compact design for easy portability.
* UV-free and certified safe for the eyes.
* Negative ionizer adds a refreshing touch to the air.

**Cons**

* Plastic construction feels a bit cheap and may not be highly durable.
* Power cord is too short for flexible placement.
* Light intensity could be too strong for sensitive eyes.
* Missing a carrying case or cover for protection.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to other light therapy devices like the Verilux HappyLight or the Circadian Optics Lattis, the SunTouch Plus stands out for its added ionizer feature. While most competitors focus solely on light therapy, this device includes negative ion generation, which mimics the refreshing feeling of being outdoors. However, the Verilux HappyLight offers a more premium build quality, and the Circadian Optics Lattis has a sleeker, modern design. If aesthetics and durability are priorities, you might lean toward those alternatives.

That said, the SunTouch Plus excels in portability and simplicity. It’s also more affordable than many competitors, making it a good entry-level option for those new to light therapy. The downside is that it doesn’t offer adjustable brightness levels, which some other models include for added control.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

While I can’t mention the exact price, the SunTouch Plus is reasonably priced compared to similar devices on the market. It’s not the cheapest option, but the additional ionizer feature justifies its cost to some extent. If you’re looking for a dual-purpose device that combines light therapy and air purification, this one offers decent value. However, if you’re only interested in light therapy, you might find more budget-friendly options with fewer bells and whistles.

**Final Thoughts on Features**

The SunTouch Plus is packed with features that are both practical and user-friendly. The built-in timer ensures you don’t overuse the device, and the ionizer adds a pleasant freshness to the air. I particularly appreciated how it seamlessly fits into my daily routine without feeling like a chore. It’s not perfect, but it’s a solid choice for anyone looking to try light therapy for mood enhancement or energy boosting.

1iks23m,https://www.reddit.com/r/mindfulnesschallenges/comments/1iks23m/empowerment/,Empowerment,"# This Is the Era of Empowerment: A Journey Towards Self-Discovery

In a world filled with constant change and uncertainty, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. However, amidst the chaos, there comes a point in life—a personal renaissance—where one realizes the importance of aligning with a positive mindset and embracing the power of self-discovery. This is the era where I consciously choose to cultivate a life that resonates with authenticity, positivity, and self-love. Here’s a deep dive into the guiding principles that shape this transformative journey.

## Trust the Timing of My Life

One of the most liberating lessons we can embrace is the idea that everything happens for a reason, in its own time. Trusting the timing of my life has been a game-changer. It encourages patience and alleviates the pressure of societal expectations. Instead of anxiously waiting for outcomes, I have learned to appreciate the journey. Each moment, whether good or bad, presents opportunities for growth and learning. This trust doesn’t just forge resilience in me; it cultivates a peaceful acceptance of life’s unpredictability.

## Distance from Negative Energy

Negative energy can be insidious, creeping into our lives through relationships, environments, and even our thought patterns. The crucial step I’ve undertaken is to create a safe distance from it. Letting go of toxic influences—be they people or self-defeating thoughts—has allowed me to reclaim my space. By setting boundaries, I protect my peace, fostering an environment where positivity can flourish. This proactive approach to distancing myself from negativity is not just about exclusion; it’s about making room for positivity and joy.

## Spend Time with Uplifting People

Surrounding myself with uplifting individuals has become a priority. The people we choose to spend time with can significantly influence our mindset and emotional well-being. By engaging with those who inspire, motivate, and challenge me positively, I cultivate an atmosphere of encouragement. These connections are not only beneficial for morale but also foster collaboration and shared growth. Being around like-minded, resilient individuals serves as a reminder that I am not alone on this journey.

## Focus on What Is in My Control

In the grand scheme of life, there are countless factors we cannot control. Instead of letting these uncertainties stifle my progress, I find empowerment in focusing on what I can influence. By honing in on my actions, thoughts, and responses, I reclaim my power. This shift in perspective transforms the way I approach challenges, allowing me to respond proactively rather than react defensively. Understanding that my agency lies within my choices fosters both clarity and confidence.

## Prioritize Self-Care Practices

Self-care is often misunderstood as a luxury, but it is, in fact, a necessity for a fulfilling life. Prioritizing self-care practices has become foundational in my daily routine. From meditation and exercise to reading and journaling, identifying activities that nurture my mental, emotional, and physical well-being has been crucial. A well-rounded self-care regimen rejuvenates my spirit and equips me to face life’s challenges with resilience and grace. It’s a conscious choice to honor my needs, proving that self-love is not selfish; it’s essential.

## Embrace My Imperfections

Perfection is an illusion; in striving for it, we often overlook the beauty of our authentic selves. Embracing my imperfections has been a radical act of self-acceptance. This era marks a shift in how I perceive failure and flaws—not as detriments, but as unique aspects of my individuality that add depth to my character. Accepting my imperfections fosters a sense of liberation, allowing me to show up as my true self in all areas of my life without the fear of judgment.

## Focus on the Present Moment

Finally, cultivating mindfulness by focusing on the present moment is an essential practice in this new era. The past is gone, and the future remains uncertain, but the present is alive with possibilities. By embracing mindfulness, I anchor myself in the here and now, enjoying the richness of every experience. Whether it’s a sip of coffee or a deep conversation with a friend, being present transforms mundane moments into extraordinary memories.

### Conclusion

This era is defined by intentionality and self-awareness. By trusting the timing of my life, distancing myself from negativity, surrounding myself with uplifting people, prioritizing what I can control, engaging in self-care, embracing imperfections, and focusing on the present, I am crafting a life filled with purpose and fulfillment. This journey is not just about self-improvement; it’s about self-discovery and creating a life that genuinely reflects who I am. Each of these principles builds a beautiful tapestry of resilience and positivity that enriches not only my life but also the lives of those I encounter. This is the era where I reclaim my narrative, and in doing so, I inspire others to do the same.

Hi ladies. I don't feel comfortable confiding in anyone I know about this but I really needed to spill it somewhere. 

I've been with my husband for eight years. In the first year we were together he went on three solo trips to Morocco, I found it suspicious at the time but I put it down to my own insecurities from previous relationships. 

Three years after that trip I found out he was messaging a woman from over there on and off, it broke my heart because she sent me some of the messages and he had told her he loved her. I asked her if they had met before, she told me they hadn't. She said they had spoke about it but she hadn't been able to. I was so hurt but I gave him another chance, he claimed the only reason he had been still in communication with her on and off was because she owed him money and he wanted it back. 

Fast forward to 2023 I discovered emails which completely knocked me for six, in 2018 and 2021 he had emailed an adult worker asking if they were available. When I confronted him he  claimed that he didn't know why he did it but that he never went through with it, more of a on a whim then when reality hit he stopped himself going further. I was heavily pregnant at the time and just wanted it all to go away so yet again I moved past it, I had no evidence that he had. 

Since then I've been tormented with the past, my trust is skakey at best. Last week I discovered that he wasn't happy with the frequency we have sex after discovering he had told his friend how often we have it. 
That really hurt me, I'm quite a private person, I work hard and I do everything I can for my family with very little time or thought for myself. It shook everything up to the surface for me, Ive been quiet this past week thinking about it all but last night I asked him for the ""truth"". 

We sat down and he said he would be honest, that I deserves the truth and he would answer all my questions honestly. 

My first question was why was he in morroco?. 

He told me he had been trying to meet the woman I caught him talking to, everytime he went out there she was a no show. I asked him if he met anyone else out there, he told me he met a woman at the beach and took her out for food and a coffee. 

That has actually hurt me to my core, we didn't live together at the time but we had been together 10 months. He was very much a part of my family, spent time with my children and extended family and told me he loved me. 

I asked him about the adult workers, he still maintains he didn't see them but when pressed admitted to using them before we met. 

I don't want to shame anyone for using adult workers or being an adult worker but the truth is had I known that it would have changed my views of him from day one. 

I feel like last night was the first time of me truly meeting my husband. 
I didn't yell, I didn't get upset. I told him I'm glad he was honest after years of me asking him to tell me the truth. 

I told him I needed time for this all to sink in. 

Today I feel awful. 

Was I just never enough from day one?. 

He told me he's always loved me and it's not that at all but how would you feel if you were me?. I suppose that's why I'm here, how would you feel? because right now I just feel sad and not enough. ",4,1739034478.0,CheatersConfronted,4,0.75,False

1ikrvbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesbyChris/comments/1ikrvbk/the_president_of_my_hoa_is_trying_to_ruin_my_life/,The President Of My HOA Is Trying To Ruin My Life,"When my marriage fell apart, I was devastated. My wife left with her affair partner and forced me to sell the house, so I had to find a new place to live. Fortunately, my half of the sale and my savings were enough to buy a small place in a nice neighborhood. It had three rooms, a garage, and room for a garden (a habit I picked up to relax from all the stress the witch caused me). All in all, I considered myself lucky. 

And then I got the first notice. 

It was tacked to the door of my house when I came home from work. “Trashcans must be no more than nine inches from the curb. This is a first notice - future violations will incur fines. 

Sincerely, Rivercrest HOA”

Ok, ridiculous, but I moved the trash closer. 

The next day, there was another. 

“No bushes can be within two feet of the road. Further violations will incur fines. 

-Sincerely, Rivercrest HOA”

They weren’t even my bushes - they were there when I bought the house. But whatever - I moved them back a foot.

Two days later there was another. 

“You are in violation of the neighborhood noise ordinance - no loud noises are permitted after 8pm. Further violations will incur fines. 

-Sincerely, Rivercrest HOA”

I wasn’t even home last night - I’d just gotten back from a work trip. I wrote a response to that effect and left it on the main office of the HOA.

Two days later:

“No private gardens are permitted on neighborhood grounds without written permission. Please remove your garden within forty-eight hours or incur additional penalties. 

-Sincerely, Rivercrest HOA”

Dig up my garden? Absolutely not. I went around and spoke to a few neighbors and learned that they had never had an issue with the HOA and those with gardens had never been required to get permission. 

Fed up, I took my notices and went to the main office. 

“I’d like to speak to the HOA president, please.”

“He’s busy right now.”

“He can speak to me now or to my lawyer later.”

“Ok,” the assistant replied, “I’ll see if he’s available.”

They took me into a room, offered me a cup of coffee, and left me to wait. After some time has passed, the president walked in. 

“YOU?” I asked, stunned. 

Standing before me was my wife’s affair partner. 

“Hello, John,” he replied smugly. “What seems to be the problem?”

“All these bullshit notices are the problem. No one else seems to have received them. Is there a reason I’m being targeted?”

“I don’t know what you mean. Those are all perfectly legitimate.”

“We’ll see what a judge has to say.”

“Well, since the terms of the paperwork you signed prevent you from suing the HOA, I guess we’ll never know.”

With that, he turned his back on me and left. 

The next week, I invited him over to discuss the situation. 

“What will it take to get all this harassment to stop?”

“What harassment?” he asked. “Everything I’m doing is completely within the HOA bylaws. Though I suppose if you gave Wendy the money she deserves from the sale of the house…”

“She already got her half directly from the bank.”

“She deserved more than half.”

“That’s extortion.”

“Not at all. I’m not telling you to do anything. Now, if that’s all, I have business to attend to.”

I stared at him - so rude, so smug, so arrogant. He slept with my wife, broke up my marriage, and now made my life hell and threatened me. How dare he?!? For the first time since Wendy cheated, I lost it and blacked out.

Weeks later, I sat on my porch, admiring my garden. The roses and orchids looked particularly vibrant. I guess it’s true what they say - anything will bloom with care. And the right fertilizer.

I just got a used gaggia classic to learn how to modify these machines for fun and to make some nice espresso. 

After wathcing a few videos i learned that its really important that the boiler is in good shape before using it

I already sensed that it must be an older model because the steam wand is totally different than the videos on YouTube(i dont mean the rancilio upgrade wand). Im no coffee machine expert but it seems like it doesnt have the 3way valve and the boiler looks totally different from the ones i see on YouTube and also the steam part is totally different. After that i went to unbolt the shower screen from the group head just to discover that under that its again totally different than the ones i see on YouTube haha. 
The inside looks fairly clean after i opened it up. 

So my question is:
Is this even a gaggia boiler?
Do i actually need to change the boiler to be able to have 3way solenoid valve? 
If i wanna add pid and pressure guage and the common mods should i just purchase an another machine with the correct boiler? 

I added i a few pics.

1ikro7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ikro7u/i_made_a_new_friend_in_milan_but_my_brother/,"I made a new friend in Milan, but my brother doesn't think so...","I went on a trip to Milan, Italy and someone who followed me on Instagram about a year ago DMed me. He never reached out to me before, but he noticed in my Instagram stories that I was there and he lives in Milan. He invited me to a cup of coffee, but I initially said no because I was traveling by myself and being cautious. He was very respectful and just recommend some specialty coffee places.

However, I got curious and so after a couple days i decided to give him a chance and we met up. At first it was at his place of work just so I feel comfortable and reassured. Then we met outside his work and we went to an Irish pub he goes to a lot. We talked for hours then we went to another place, this time a café he used to work at and we talked a little more. Then he asked if he could kiss me.
Tldr, yes, we hooked up.

He did set a hard boundary and told me that this is just physical, and that he isn't looking for anything ""sentimental"". I 1000% agreed (obviously, we just met and who knows of we are going to see each other again.) He also said that he wants to stay friends, and that after our hook up we shouldn't be physical in any way, not even kiss, to avoid any unnecessary attachments. Again 1000% agreed.

On my last day, we had our final goodbyes. And even though he said that he doesn't want anything sentimental, our talk was pretty heartfelt and sentimental. 

The main takeaway was that he made me promise him that I take care of myself. When we talked he said that I should open up to people more because I have an amazing stroy to tell and that he can tell I'm a little shy/insecure of myself, there isn't anything wrong with that, but he thinks that I have no real reason to be. 
He said that though he's not looking for anything romantic with me, he knows that I'm worth it. That I have a lot to offer and that I should have the love and respect that I deserve. And to not let anyone else tell me my worth because I'm a valuable person.

One of the last things he said was that i could reach out to him at any time for anything at all. It might take a bit for him to respond because he can get very busy at work and the time difference, but to reach out for anything nonetheless.
Honestly there's so much more that he said but I'll leave it there to make this not so long.

The reason why I'm asking if we actually are friends is because when I told my brother that I think I made a legit friend in Milan, he told me to manage my expectations. Making a ""legitimate"" friend; when I've only known them a few days... 
I mean, I get it, he's trying to look out for me and to not have huge expectations, ans I understand the reality of us meeting again is little to none, but is it that ridiculous to think that we really are friends?

If it was just a one time hook up and nothing more, then why tell me all this? Just to be nice? He made me promise him multiple times
He told me so many times that I'm worth it. Again, he made it clear that we are just friends and he's not looking for anything romantic. He just wants me to take care of myself. Is it stupid for me to think that he means it, when he says that we're friends?

I just wanted to pop in and remind you that you’re absolutely incredible. You woke up today, and that’s already a win. Whether you hit snooze six times or jumped out of bed like the superhero you are, you are exactly where you need to be.

So, here’s your reminder: You’re enough. Just as you are. Don’t let anyone (not even that little self-doubt whisper) tell you otherwise. If you were any more amazing, we’d need a whole other planet to hold all that greatness.

Let today be the day you shine bright, laugh loud, and sprinkle a little extra magic into the world. And, if you happen to smile at someone along the way… just know, you might be making their day a whole lot better. 😉

Now, go on and slay like the queen/king/legend you are. 💖

Everyday after my weekend classes I go to this food court in a mall. However in the security check outside the fc, the guards don't allow any outside food items. So let's say you walk in with a can of diet coke, you either leave it outside or finish it before entering.

This time, while I was outside the security check, a lady walked in with a cup of cold coffee. One of the security guards told her that outside food items are not allowed. She began to argue with the guard saying how on earth would a coffee cup be any problem? The security guards quite politely told her that if they let her in the fc with outside food items then the upper management will be angry at that guards. I mean yea, no one wants to berated by their boss. 

They said she can finish the drink  here and then enter. However the lady simply did not care and even her boyfriend stepped in and began to tell the guards that they are being unfair to her for no reason.

Eventually the security guards gave up and allowed her to walk in with the cold coffee. I heard the two guards mumbling to each other that because of them, the boss is now going to shout at them today.

Do you think the lady was unfair or was this simply an inconvenient rule. I mean what if the person is in a hurry? one can't chug an entire cup of cold coffee in a minute? Who is in the wrong here?

I keep a log of all my shots as I’m still learning and trying to improve my dialing in skills.

My best recorded shot was 16g:43g in 24.5s. The pressure would max out at 9 bar or just above, before hovering at 9 bars and then dropping to just above 8 bars for the remainder of the shot. I found this to be the sweet spot.

However, the past few days, my shots have not been as good. I’ve kept grind, tamping, etc. all relatively consistent. I’ve noticed the max pressure now only gets close to 9 bars for a moment but doesn’t even hit 9 bars anymore and bottoms out at or just below 8 bars for most of the shot. Likewise, the same ratio shot now pulls in 21s vs 24.5s as before.

I’m curious if this could be due to the beans being slightly aged more after nearly two weeks. Or if maybe something is up with my machine’s pressure or OPV. I’ve noticed the OPV setting on my machine has shifted around on its own over time before. So I’m now going to shift it back up in case that’s what is artificially affecting my shot.

Basically, did the beans just age or did my machine pressure change? Thank you! ",1,1739033205.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

I’ve seen a number of “how to’s” advising that for med to light roasts especially, a trick is to rub the grinds between your fingers and the consistency should be powder-like. I can’t get water to pass through anything approaching that fine. The grind size I have to use is more gritty, like a fine sand.

I think my puck prep is pretty good. And my grinder is capable of going much finer than what I’m currently using. I do not use a puck screen, and I’m using the Porto filter and basket that came with the bambino.

I hope someone may be able to help me understand 'what' it means because Cuisinart doesn't believe in personal repairs, I guess.

  
**Make & Model:** Cuisinart Grind & Brew dgb-400nas

**Age:** 2.5 years old

**Error:** Coffee makers LED's will all randomly flash (two or three times, normally) with the error code ErL on it.

**What I was doing:** I was giving the coffee makes water reservoir a deep cleaning. I ran a solution of 1/3 vinegar and 2/3 water through the system to descale. I ran the coffee maker 3-4 times during this process. 1 time with vinegar, 3 times with plain water. I also had my hand in the reservoir to scrub the sides. It wasn't until I actually prepared it for the morning that the error started going off.

**Additional notes:** The error seems intermittent. The machine will operate as normal until the lights start flashing with the error code, then cancel out the operation (grinding, brewing, etc.) I can sometimes get it to work as it should by fiddling with the grinder sensor on the top, but this could possibly just be my imagination.

  
**Requested Solution:** I just want to know what the error ErL means so I can keep digging. Since it's intermittent it is hard to narrow down.

And if anything, would he let me go near the various latex creatures even if I gestured about it? He has to, since I'm immune…! I could show him I'm braver instead of sitting around in his office, or bringing him coffee or leaving me to practice with the balls alone.

1ikrfu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdultChildren/comments/1ikrfu8/just_had_a_hard_conversation_with_my_mom/,Just had a hard conversation with my mom,"TW: domestic abuse, suicide

I (30F) just had to talk to my alcoholic mother (63) about her behavior toward my alcoholic father (70) last night. She had been verbally and physically abusive and he called me in fear around 10:30 pm. He said part of why he was calling was so I could ""serve as a witness"" in case she killed him. Luckily she passed out after locking herself in their bedroom and primally screaming herself hoarse. 

I haven't lived in that house for over a decade. But growing up, these kinds of fights were common. My worst trauma memory is almost like a Renaissance still life: my mom, on the ground, holding a knife. My dad kneeling above her with her wrist in his hand to stop her from stabbing him. Him yelling for me to call the police. Me, so very small, frozen in the doorway with silent tears running down my chubby cheeks. I never called the police. I still wonder if I should have.

The last 10-odd years living on my own, I knew my parents never stopped drinking at night and I knew they were unhappy in their marriage. But I wanted to believe that these kinds of fights didn't happen anymore. How could they still have the energy for that kind of rage at their age, especially after 30+ years without a single night sober?

I teeter on the edge of LC with my folks. I visit for a few hours on major holidays and birthdays. Maybe talk to them on the phone for 15 minutes once a month. Because they only drink at night, I never respond to calls or texts after dinner. And of course we never, ever acknowledge their drinking. Which is why I'm shaking and crying right now after confronting my mom over the phone this morning.

Although both of my parents are alcoholics, my dad mostly just withdraws into himself and watches TV. My mom, on the other hand, becomes venomous. Lately, she's been getting drunk and telling my dad to kill himself. He said she tells him specific ways he should do it. And last night she tried to hit him several times while screaming at him for not doing it yet. 

So I called her this morning. She answered the phone perfectly chipper, said she was letting my dad sleep in since it's a Saturday, said she was just relaxing at the table with a cup of coffee. We chatted about cooking for a bit before I asked: ""Do you remember last night?"" Her tone completely changed. It turned cold and deep, animal. She said she remembered. ""Do you remember trying to hit dad and telling him to kill himself?"" I do, she said. ""Do you remember telling him to kill himself all those other nights?"" I do, she said again. I told her that was unacceptable.

She wanted to point fingers and say he started it, but I shut that down and said I wanted to focus on her. The rest of the conversation probably only lasted 5 minutes, but I basically said that I couldn't pretend this wasn't happening, and that my dad was so alone and so sad and—last night—so scared. The longer I talked, the more I felt like a frightened little kid again. Near the end I asked if she planned on drinking every night forever. That was the moment I most felt like a vulnerable child, and there was something almost out of body about it. I felt heartbreak for myself, for my child self. I could hear how small my voice had become. And my mom just said, coldly, ""I don't know.""

I don't know if confronting her will change anything. Probably not. But you have to understand, nobody talks to my mom about her drinking. Nobody. I think I only brought it up directly once as a teenager and it was awful. It's always been a given that the drinking won't stop, that she doesn't want to stop, and that if you mention it, she will later emotionally eviscerate you. But my dad doesn't have anyone at all and I couldn't live with myself if I didn't try to stand up to her for him, even just this once. I thought about it all night and all morning and I don't think she'll take her anger out on him because I confronted her. She'll probably be cowed for a few days and drink in silence before ramping back up to her old, yelling ways. But maybe those few days will give my dad some small bit of a peace. I don't know.

For unrelated reasons, I've been thinking  about fearlessness and courage a lot lately. I think it's harder to be courageous because that means you're acting against fear. And leading up to this call, I had so much fear. But I told myself that I wanted to be a person with courage, and I'm proud of myself for making the call even though every fiber of my being wanted to pretend last night never happened. Still, that doesn't mean I feel good. I feel like an empty cup right now. But if I hadn't called her out on her behavior, I know I'd feel a whole lot worse. ",6,1739032950.0,AdultChildren,1,1.0,False

Let’s embark on this journey to uncover the details of Java Burn and see if it truly is the game-changer in weight management that it claims to be.

# What is Java Burn?

Java Burn is a unique weight loss supplement that comes in the form of a tasteless powder designed to be mixed with coffee. Its creators have harnessed the natural fat-burning properties of coffee and combined them with a proprietary blend of nutrients that aim to enhance metabolism and promote overall health. By simply adding one packet of Java Burn to your morning coffee, users are promised a boost in energy levels, improved metabolism, and support in their weight loss efforts.

The concept behind Java Burn is rooted in the belief that coffee itself can serve as a catalyst for weight loss, but it requires the right combination of ingredients to unlock its full potential. Java Burn’s formulation is based on extensive scientific research, aiming to provide a solution that is both effective and convenient for those who enjoy their daily cup of coffee. With this product, users can enjoy the familiar taste of their coffee while potentially facilitating fat loss and improving energy levels throughout the day.

By promoting Java Burn as a “super coffee,” the developers have positioned it as an essential addition to the morning routine of anyone serious about weight management. The product capitalizes on the popularity of coffee in everyday life, making it a simple yet effective option for those looking to lose weight without significant dietary changes or rigorous exercise routines.

A tasteless addition with big results – Java Burn for your coffee now!

# Does Java Burn Work?

The effectiveness of Java Burn has been a topic of interest for many potential users. Based on the scientific principles behind its formulation and the positive user testimonials, there is a strong argument that it can indeed work as intended. The combination of coffee with the proprietary blend of nutrients in Java Burn is designed to enhance metabolism, increase fat-burning, and support energy levels throughout the day.

Many users have reported noticeable results when incorporating Java Burn into their daily routine. These results may vary from person to person, depending on individual metabolism, lifestyle, and adherence to the recommended usage guidelines. However, the general consensus is that Java Burn can provide a helpful boost for those who are looking to enhance their weight loss efforts.

It is essential to note that while Java Burn can support weight loss, it is not a magic solution. For optimal results, it should be combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise. This aligns with the broader understanding of weight management, which emphasizes that supplements can be effective tools but should not replace healthy lifestyle choices.

In summary, Java Burn appears to work for many users by leveraging the natural benefits of coffee and enhancing them with its unique formula. While individual results may vary, there is enough evidence to suggest that it can be a valuable addition to a weight loss regimen.

# The 7-Second Coffee Loophole

The 7-second coffee loophole is an intriguing marketing concept used to promote Java Burn, highlighting how easy it is to incorporate into your daily routine. According to the product’s website, by simply adding Java Burn to your morning coffee—a process that takes just seven seconds—your body enters a “fat-melting mode,” making weight loss more accessible without the need for strict dieting or exercise.

While the idea is compelling, it’s important to approach it with a critical mindset. The 7-second coffee loophole suggests that Java Burn can significantly accelerate weight loss, but it’s essential to understand that no supplement can replace the foundational principles of healthy living. The ingredients in Java Burn, such as green tea extract, L-carnitine, and chlorogenic acid, have been shown to aid in weight loss, but they should be viewed as supportive elements rather than standalone solutions.

For healthy and sustainable weight loss, it’s crucial to maintain a balanced diet and engage in regular physical activity. Supplements like Java Burn can complement these efforts, but they are not a substitute for a healthy lifestyle. Therefore, if you’re considering using Java Burn or any other dietary supplement, consulting with a healthcare provider before starting is always recommended to ensure it aligns with your individual health needs and goals.

# What are the ingredients in Java Burn?

# Chlorogenic Acid

Chlorogenic acid is a key component of Java Burn, known for its potential to support weight loss and metabolic health. This compound, found primarily in coffee beans, is believed to help regulate blood sugar levels, making it easier for the body to manage fat storage and energy use. Research suggests that chlorogenic acid can help reduce glucose absorption in the intestines and improve insulin sensitivity, leading to better overall metabolic function.

In addition to its weight loss benefits, chlorogenic acid has been associated with various health benefits, including antioxidant properties that can help combat oxidative stress in the body. By incorporating chlorogenic acid into your daily routine through Java Burn, you may experience improved energy levels and enhanced fat-burning capabilities, making it a valuable ingredient for anyone looking to shed pounds.

# Camellia Sinensis

Camellia Sinensis, the plant from which green tea is derived, is another significant ingredient in Java Burn. This powerful botanical is renowned for its numerous health benefits, particularly its ability to support weight loss and promote overall well-being. The active compounds in Camellia Sinensis, including catechins and caffeine, work synergistically to enhance metabolism and increase fat oxidation.

Research has shown that green tea extract can help boost metabolic rate and assist in fat burning, particularly during exercise. By including Camellia Sinensis in Java Burn, users can harness the natural fat-burning properties of green tea while enjoying their favorite coffee. This combination not only aids in weight management but also provides a host of other health benefits, such as improved cardiovascular health and enhanced cognitive function.

# Chromium

Chromium is an essential trace mineral that plays a vital role in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. In the context of Java Burn, chromium is included for its ability to help regulate blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity. This is particularly important for individuals looking to manage their weight, as stable blood sugar levels can lead to reduced cravings and better appetite control.

Studies have indicated that chromium supplementation can result in modest weight loss and improved body composition when combined with a healthy diet and exercise. By incorporating chromium into the Java Burn formula, users may experience a more balanced approach to weight management, making it easier to stick to their goals without succumbing to unhealthy cravings.

# L-Carnitine

L-Carnitine is an amino acid derivative that plays a crucial role in the body’s energy production process. It is responsible for transporting fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they are oxidized and converted into energy. This process is particularly beneficial for individuals looking to lose weight, as it enhances the body’s ability to burn fat for fuel.

In Java Burn, L-Carnitine is included to support metabolic health and boost energy levels. By promoting efficient fat utilization, L-Carnitine can help users achieve their weight loss goals more effectively. Additionally, this ingredient may also enhance exercise performance, making it a valuable addition for those who incorporate physical activity into their weight loss journey.

# L-Theanine

L-Theanine is an amino acid commonly found in tea leaves, particularly green tea. It is known for its calming effects on the mind and body, helping to reduce stress and promote relaxation without causing drowsiness. In the context of Java Burn, L-Theanine serves to balance the stimulating effects of caffeine from coffee, providing a smooth energy boost without the jitters often associated with caffeine consumption.

The inclusion of L-Theanine in Java Burn not only enhances the overall experience of enjoying a cup of coffee but may also support cognitive function and improve focus. By promoting a sense of calm and well-being, L-Theanine can help users stick to their weight loss goals by reducing stress-related eating and improving overall mental clarity.

# Vitamin Complex

The vitamin complex in Java Burn provides a range of essential nutrients that support overall health and well-being. Vitamins play a crucial role in various bodily functions, including metabolism, immune support, and energy production. By including a vitamin complex in the Java Burn formula, users can benefit from enhanced nutrient absorption and overall vitality.

The vitamins in Java Burn work synergistically with the other ingredients to support weight loss efforts and improve metabolic function. This comprehensive approach ensures that users not only feel energized and focused but also receive the nutritional support needed to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

Coffee lovers, rejoice! Java Burn makes your brew a fat-burning machine.

# Java Burn Benefits

# Powered By Nature

One of the most appealing aspects of Java Burn is that it is powered by natural ingredients.

Natural ingredients can offer a range of health benefits without the side effects often associated with synthetic compounds.

By incorporating elements such as green tea extract and chlorogenic acid, Java Burn not only supports weight loss but also enhances overall well-being.

The use of plant ingredients allows Java Burn to be accessible to a wide range of dietary preferences, including vegetarian and vegan lifestyles. This inclusivity is essential for a product aiming to reach a broad audience while promoting healthy living. Users can enjoy the benefits of Java Burn without compromising their dietary choices, making it a versatile addition to any health regimen.

# Non-GMO

Java Burn is proudly labeled as non-GMO, which means that it does not contain any genetically modified organisms. This designation is significant for consumers who are increasingly concerned about the quality and source of their food and supplements. By choosing non-GMO products, users can feel more confident in their purchasing decisions, knowing that they are supporting natural farming practices.

The non-GMO status of Java Burn ensures that users receive a product that is free from harmful chemicals and artificial additives. This commitment to quality reflects the brand’s dedication to providing a safe and effective supplement that aligns with consumer values. As more people seek transparency in their food choices, Java Burn’s non-GMO formulation is undoubtedly a strong selling point.

# Soy & Dairy Free

Java Burn addresses this concern by being both soy and dairy-free, making it suitable for a wide range of dietary needs. This inclusivity allows users to enjoy the benefits of Java Burn without worrying about potential allergic reactions or sensitivities.

By offering a product that is free from soy and dairy, Java Burn caters to those following plant-based diets or those who simply prefer to avoid these ingredients for personal reasons. This consideration enhances the product’s appeal and positions it as a versatile option for anyone looking to support their weight loss journey.

# Tasteless/Dissolves Instantly

One of the standout features of Java Burn is its tasteless nature, which allows it to seamlessly blend into any cup of coffee. Many users appreciate the fact that they do not have to alter the flavor of their favorite beverage while reaping the benefits of the supplement. The instant dissolvability of Java Burn ensures that it mixes easily with coffee, making it a convenient addition to the morning routine.

This ease of use is particularly appealing to those who may be hesitant about trying new supplements. Java Burn’s tasteless formulation eliminates any barriers to entry, allowing users to incorporate it into their daily lives effortlessly. This convenience factor can significantly contribute to consistent use, which is essential for achieving desired weight loss results.

# Non-Habit Forming

In a market filled with various weight loss supplements, it is essential to consider the potential for dependency or habit formation. Java Burn stands out in this regard, as it is designed to be non-habit forming. This means that users can incorporate it into their routine without the fear of developing a reliance on the product.

Being non-habit forming is a significant benefit for those looking to maintain a healthy lifestyle without introducing additional challenges. Users can feel confident that they can rely on Java Burn as a supportive tool in their weight loss journey without the risk of long-term dependence. This assurance adds to the overall appeal of the product, encouraging users to give it a try.

When evaluating the effectiveness of any supplement, it’s essential to consider how it fits into a broader context of diet and exercise. While Java Burn can provide a valuable boost to your weight loss journey, it is most effective when combined with healthy lifestyle choices. For optimal results, users should aim to incorporate Java Burn into a balanced diet rich in whole foods, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Such a diet not only supports weight loss but also improves overall health and well-being. Regular exercise is equally important; combining cardiovascular activities with strength training can enhance fat-burning potential and contribute to muscle preservation during weight loss. The ingredients in Java Burn are scientifically designed to work in harmony with coffee, promoting increased metabolism and fat oxidation. Many users report positive results when Java Burn is used as part of a well-rounded approach to health. However, it is crucial to set realistic expectations. Weight loss is often a gradual process, and supplements like Java Burn should be viewed as supportive tools rather than quick fixes. Additionally, individual responses to supplements can vary based on factors such as metabolism, activity level, and adherence to dietary guidelines. Keeping these variables in mind, it is clear that Java Burn can be a valuable ally in the quest for weight loss when used alongside healthy lifestyle practices. In conclusion, while supplements like Java Burn can enhance weight loss efforts, they are not a substitute for a healthy diet and regular exercise. Users should approach their weight loss journey holistically, integrating Java Burn as a supportive element to achieve their goals effectively. Is Java Burn a Scam? In a market filled with weight loss supplements, skepticism is natural when considering a new product like Java Burn. However, there is substantial evidence to support the legitimacy of Java Burn as a reputable weight loss supplement. The product is backed by scientific research, and its ingredients have been shown to have beneficial effects on metabolism and fat burning. Furthermore, the company behind Java Burn is transparent about its formulation and manufacturing processes, ensuring that consumers receive a high-quality product. The inclusion of a 60-day money-back guarantee reflects the company’s confidence in their product and provides customers with a risk-free opportunity to try Java Burn. While individual results may vary, user testimonials and reviews indicate that many people have experienced positive outcomes with Java Burn.

Java Burn is a term used to refer to the potential weight loss benefits associated with consuming coffee or caffeine. In recent years, there has been growing interest in the relationship between coffee consumption and weight management. This article will explore whether Java Burn can indeed help with weight loss and discuss some important considerations.\*\*Java Burn and Metabolism:\*\*One of the reasons Java Burn is believed to aid in weight loss is its potential impact on metabolism. Coffee contains caffeine, which is a natural stimulant that can increase metabolic rate. This means that consuming Java Burn may help your body burn more calories, even at rest. However, the effect of caffeine on metabolism varies among individuals, and the impact on weight loss may not be significant for everyone.\*\*Appetite Suppression:\*\*Another potential benefit of Java Burn is its ability to suppress appetite. Caffeine can act as an appetite suppressant, making you feel less hungry and reducing the likelihood of overeating. This can indirectly contribute to weight loss by helping you maintain a calorie deficit.\*\*Energy Boost and Physical Performance:\*\*Java Burn's caffeine content can also provide an energy boost, making it an appealing choice for those who engage in physical activities or exercise. Increased energy levels can lead to improved performance during workouts, potentially helping you burn more calories and fat. However, it's important to note that excessive caffeine consumption can have negative effects on sleep, hydration, and overall health. It's crucial to consume Java Burn in moderation and listen to your body's response.

Firstly, the effects of caffeine can vary among individuals. Some people may experience increased heart rate, jitteriness, or digestive issues when consuming Java Burn. It's crucial to monitor your body's response and consult a healthcare professional if you have any concerns**.**Additionally, Java Burn should not be seen as a magic solution for weight loss. It's important to adopt a holistic approach that includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, and overall healthy lifestyle habits. Relying solely on Java Burn without making other necessary changes may not yield significant weight loss results.Ingredients in Java Burn**:\*\*1.

It may help in boosting metabolism and reducing the absorption of carbohydrates.2. Garcinia Cambogia: This tropical fruit extract contains hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which is believed to aid in weight loss by suppressing appetite and blocking the production of fat in the body.3.

It also provides a natural source of caffeine, which can improve energy levels.4. Raspberry Ketones: These natural compounds derived from raspberries may help in increasing the breakdown of fat cells and regulating metabolism.5.

It may also have a positive impact on appetite control and weight management.6. L-Theanine: Found in green tea, L-Theanine is an amino acid that promotes relaxation and reduces stress. It may also help in improving focus and concentration.Please note that the specific formulation and concentration of these ingredients may vary depending on the brand of Java Burn.

1ikraie,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ikraie/relationship_advice_my_23m_girlfriend_23f_has/,Relationship Advice] My (23M) girlfriend (23F) has been emotionally draining,"Context. I’ve been dating this girl for 3 months, we are sort of long distance (2 hours drive from each other), we see each other 1-2 times per week. While there have been good moments, the relationship feels overwhelmingly difficult and emotionally exhausting. This is my first relationship, so I’m not sure if what I’m experiencing is normal or if I’m just the problem. I think a lot of the issues have to do with jumping into a relationship with her too quickly (known her for 3 months, got together after only 2 weeks, bad idea clearly).

Here’s a breakdown of the issues we’ve been having:

1. Accusatory Behavior & Jumping to Conclusions:

She often jumps to conclusions and accuses me of being inconsiderate or unloving over small things. For example:

Forgetting to take a picture of her = “You don’t even think I’m pretty.” Don’t get me wrong, I like taking pictures but is it so wrong to just be living in the present moment sometimes and just forget about taking a picture here and there? We had an outing once where I didn’t offer to take a picture of her the whole day (even though she did look VERY pretty) and she said I don’t like her at all, and I should know how much she values pictures by that time. I’ve never had a habit of taking pictures so often but it seems like this is a big thing for her, but I personally find it a drag to take pictures as often as she probably wants me to.

Another time we were sitting in a coffee shop and she said ‘you’re not even gonna take a picture of me??’ I thought she was acting that way as a joke, but then she says that women are allowed to be entitled and ‘sassy’, while men shouldn’t be allowed to act in such a way. I’m not sure if we have the same definition of entitled, hopefully not. 

We were going to a shop to get some snacks and discussed getting water beforehand. Turns out once we got in there, both of us just focussed on the snacks and didn’t get the water. She said it was my fault and said “You’re very inconsiderate.”

She sends me so many texts, voice messages, videos, selfies, reels everyday that sometimes I am at work and cannot keep up. We had an argument about me not being attentive enough and not ‘caring’ about her because I failed to like her instagram reels and was instead sending my own (I think I sent maybe 2 videos compared to her 15-20). Don’t get me wrong, I do like communicating everyday, but this feels overwhelming.

She says she’s not used to wearing a seatbelt in a car. I offered to remind her each time she forgets and her response was ‘it should be your responsibility to remind me each time, and if you don’t then you simply don’t care about my safety’. 

These comments come out of nowhere and make me feel like I’m constantly failing. She also says things like ‘You’re very emotionally immature’, ‘toxic’, ‘rude’, the list goes on. It’s hard to enjoy our time together when I feel like I’m walking on eggshells. Like ‘what am I going to do next that will make her mad?’ which then causes me to act like an idiot during dates sometimes, because I don’t even feel like I can be myself (usually I am very confident).

 

2. Princess Treatment & Expectations:

She’s said she wants to be treated “like a princess” because she feels she didn’t get enough affection growing up. That she’s always been independent and wants to be taken care of. I’ve been trying to do as much as I can. I asked her what princess treatment means for her, she said ‘being spoiled and pampered’, then I asked her to give me examples of that. She then brought up a bunch of materialistic things she should receive and I said ‘so it’s about money then?’ And then she eventually agreed that yes it is, but then the next day changed her answer to say ‘I meant spoiled with comfort and affection’ so I’m not sure what to believe anymore. 

3. Hurtful Comments:

She’s made several comments that have hurt me, such as:

Joking that my body looks disproportionate and that my head is too big for my frame. Even though I am physically fit.

Saying I “look like a virgin” when we first started dating, and used it as an insult.

Frequently joking that I make “gay gestures” (e.g., fixing my hair gently), or telling me often to ‘act like a man’ or be ‘assertive’.

She keeps complaining that she has to ‘teach me things’, and that she doesn’t have patience to do that. Admittedly, I have been lacking in a few areas but the way she explains things is very patronising. For example, we were at a restaurant and I forgot to order something with the main course, and she said ‘how could you not even be assertive, that could never be me’. Or even in bed, she wants me to ‘violate’ her, so I did do what she wanted on one occassion and after that she just wants that version of me, and feels very disappointed if I don’t act like an absolute freak in bed, she lets me know how disappointed she is, even though I make her finish multiple times. This is not really an issue in of itself, but she explicity says ‘why do I have to teach a man all these things, I don’t want to teach’, which makes me feel very bad.

When I call her out, she apologizes, but the comments still sting.

But I don’t understand, because she does shower me with compliments otherwise, says some VERY nice things that do seem genuine and like she means them. She says I’m cute, handsome, etc etc but it just confuses me sometimes. 

4. Double Standards:

She made me delete all my old dating app matches but kept a guy she’s “done things with” on her Instagram close friends story. When I asked her to remove him, she initially refused, saying he’s a family friend and removing him would cause unnecessary tension. She eventually removed him, but it felt like a fight to get there. I didn’t exactly tell her to unfollow him or to block him as I didn’t wanna seem controlling, just to remove him from ‘close friends’ as that is something you only have for actually close friends right ? Her argument was that she had over 80 people on there and that she puts me and her on her story so that ‘men stay away from her’ and it leaves her the trouble of anyone messaging her. 

She also goes on about how disrespectful it is to your partner to follow people on social media that you were romantically involved with, she got me to remove all such women on my socials (maybe there were 1 or 2), and yet still follows a lot of the guys interested in her.

5. Comparison to Her Abusive Brother:

When I get annoyed during arguments, she’s said I remind her of her abusive brother (who used to hit her) because of the “way I look at her.” She has told me time and time again how bad her brother traumatised her but I’ve never yelled at her or been violent, this comparison feels unfair and incredibly hurtful.

 6. Disagreements About Kids:

I know I want kids in the future, but she’s hesitant. She says she doesn’t want to feel like she’d lose priority to the child. She also mentioned she’d only want kids with a man who “takes responsibility and takes care of her.” When I agreed, she got upset and said, “Why didn’t you say you could be that man for me?” It felt manipulative. She says she feels like having a child would mean she is no longer the priority and won’t get any attention.

 7. Emotional Responses & Rudeness:

She admits she’s naturally a rude person and says I get too defensive during discussions. But when we argue, she often becomes emotional and throws accusations at me, saying things like, “I don’t want a boyfriend like you.” I do get defensive at times, but I never lash out, I always apologise in the end, yet she makes sure to make me feel as bad as possible because she takes a long time to move on in the argument, saying hurtful things like ‘after today, I am not sure about us’.

She also boasts about how emotionally intelligent she is, says she wishes she was the dumb one in a relationship, men are immature and stupid.

There was a time when I thanked a female cashier while we were both shopping, and she got very mad that I was nice to her, and she told me to not speak if its not necessary since she already thanked her and I didn't need to. I said that's very controlling, but then her response was that I should have picked up on the cashier's rude body language toward my gf (even though I don't recall that happening), and then not said anything to her because of that. She got very pissed about this, and told me to 'behave'. 

8. Pressure Around Intimacy:

I feel like this isn't really her fault, but I thought I'd leave it here anyway since it gives a bit more context. 

She’s pressured me into things I’m not comfortable with and that I clearly said I am not comfortable doing in the beginning. For context, we are both Muslim, and I am a virgin by choice (saving it for marriage, please don’t judge too harshly in the comments). Maybe 1 month into knowing her, we were just laying next to her and she started getting emotional saying that I am not really attracted to her because I don’t let her go down on me and neither do I go down on her, and all we do is kiss. To be honest, I don’t blame her for this, as this is very normal for the rest of the world but I clearly explained to her that I want to take things slow, fall in love and then be intimate. Instead, she guilt tripped me saying that I simply do not value her, how rejected she feels etc, and I then ended up going down on her for the first time because I felt bad. Clearly, I do not love myself and abandoned my own principles just to make her happy.

She has a pattern of ignoring my boundaries. For example, she asked me to shower with her, and when I initially declined, she said, “You clearly don’t like me.” I later agreed out of guilt, but when I didn’t compliment her in the shower, she got upset.

She’s also pressured me into having sex (although I didn’t let this happen yet), even though I’ve made it clear I want to wait (at least until I’m in love). During intimate moments, she says things like ‘Imagine how much better it would feel inside me’, or ‘can I sit on it?’ etc etc, which makes things very awkward. I bring up this later, and she then denies she wants to have sex and says she can wait, but then complains later saying ‘Don’t get me horny if you can’t do anything after’ (referring to going all the way). I understand her point of view here, but I feel like its not really anyone’s fault other than a major lack of compatibility.

I feel like we’re very different when it comes to this. She’s had FWB situations before and I don’t mind that, I just feel like we have different values. 

Listing everything out makes me realize how messy this relationship has been, even though it’s only been 2 months. A lot of it could be attributed to jumping into a relationship too quick. I’ve done a lot of “firsts” with her (both emotionally and physically), so I feel really attached to her. The good moments have been amazing, but the bad ones have been really bad. Sometimes I feel like a lot of her frustrations may have something to do with the distance, and maybe things wouldn’t have turned out this way if we spent more time together and actually built the foundations of a good relationship. We do however text and video call everyday, see each other for roughly 5-10 hours per week, so shouldn’t this be at least a good indicator of someone’s personality at least on the surface? I am not sure, I just don’t want to leave if distance is the main factor causing all these issues, but I may be delusional in thinking that. I also have a lot of flaws as well.

TL;DR: My girlfriend accuses me of being inconsiderate, makes hurtful comments, pressures me into things I’m uncomfortable with, and has different values about kids and intimacy. There are good moments, but I don’t think we’re compatible.",2,1739032578.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

1ikr7ii,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ikr7ii/no_middle_ground_between_gushing_and_choking/,No middle ground between gushing and choking shots [Rocket Appartamento + Niche Duo],"I'm experiencing a puzzling issue with my espresso setup and could use some community insight. Here's my situation:

Equipment:
- Rocket Appartamento
- Primary grinder: Niche Duo (espresso burrs)
- Backup grinder: Sette 270

The Problem:
I've recently started having extreme difficulty dialing in any coffee. There seems to be no sweet spot - one notch on either grinder causes the shot to gush, while just a few notches finer completely chokes the machine. This is happening consistently across both grinders, which is particularly strange.

What I've Tried:
1. Had the Appartamento professionally serviced - they replaced the vacuum breaker, cleaned out sediment, and confirmed the machine was functioning properly
2. Recalibrated the Niche Duo
3. Tested with both grinders to rule out grinder issues

The fact that I'm getting identical results with two different grinders makes me question what might be happening. Has anyone encountered a similar issue or have suggestions for what else I should investigate? Thank you for any help!",2,1739032362.0,espresso,10,1.0,False

Adam woke up, relaxed, and looked at the beauty next to him. She was already awake and just looking at him. “Morning, beautiful. Been up long?”

She kissed him, and they melted together. When Evelyn finally got out of bed, Adam was worn out. She winked at him as she headed to the showers and gave him a few minutes to recover.  It did wonders to the mood, and when they had breakfast on the terrace, they playfully teased each other as Min-Na came to disturb them.

“I’m sorry to disturb you Mr Wrangler but.. oh.. oh.” She stopped for a second as she accidentally sniffed the air, then grinned. “Well, you are clearly in a good mood. But still we do need to discuss the upcoming trial. Do you have time to go over the plans?” She said, and before Adam could answer, Evelyn replied, “Yes, he has. I have to leave anyway. Doc just sent me a message. There is some trouble brewing. We are low on coffee.”

Adam was looking at Min-Na to answer her then turned surprised to Evelyn. “I had five tons of it. How?”

“People got addicted, I need to find a way to solve it, or we will have a rebellion.“ She said as Min-Na hid her coffee cup behind her back innocently with a smile.  Evelyn winked at her, gave Adam a kiss, and then left them alone. Adam looked after her as he indicated for Min-Na to sit.

“That woman drives me mad.” Then he took a deep breath and looked at Min-Na.  “So, is everything going as planned?”

“There are a few changes, first of a new judge. Mr Lee will not be the Judge; the Judge is Mrs Agnivanshi. I have her file here. Not much on her, actually.  Oxford-educated, adopted at a young age into a rich family but married into an important family, quite conservative, got into law at a young age, and worked her way up the corporate ladder. Among the youngest lawyers to become a judge, she just got the promotion before they left for Dirt?” She looked at Adam, who just smiled and lifted his cup of coffee.

“I bet she has been pretty hostile towards you, too? To the point, you think she got something against me?”  Adam said as he sipped his coffee, and Min-Na nodded.

“Don’t worry about it; it's a human way of showing they don’t pick any sides. The trial needs to be as neutral as possible. If it goes our way, then that new law will be struck down, and we can free everybody here.” He said, and Min-Na smiled.

“They already are. All your slaves were confiscated and freed. I have been informed that if you win the case, you will be reimbursed for the loss of your property.” She replied as a young man approached them.  He was dressed in a nice suit and well-combed hair. He looked like a lawyer and Adam smiled, then turned back to Min-Na.

“And how did they take that? How many left?”

“Fifty-six left, two-hundred and six joined your clan; most are afraid to lose their jobs. Vorts have been working overtime trying to calm down people.”  Then she turned to the young man. “Ahh, Mr Gong. A pleasure to finally meet you.”  They both stood to greet him, and he looked a little flustered at the behavior while a maid droid that looked like a famous actress of the ancient days cleaned up the table and brought some snacks and drinks.

“The pleasure is all mine, Mrs Min-Na.” Then he took a second to just look at Adam. “Sir, Thank you. I owe you everything. I will do my very best to help ensure this goes away.”

“You don’t owe me anything, Mr. Gong, Please join us, and let's start this meeting.” He replied as they sat down. “I can see you have made something of your life. That’s all we can ask for. “

“Yes, I have worked hard to reach where I am now, and I have gone over the files Mrs Min-Na has provided, and she seems to have everything covered. As she has surmised, she can only be co-council as her lawyer status is not valid for inter-Earth jurisdiction. Something I’m sure she will quickly be adjusted too.” He said as he looked at her, and she smiled.

“I will simply hire some human lawyer to solve that problem. Anyway, our main problem is Mrs Agnivanshi, I don’t trust her. She seemed xenophobic when I approached her.”  She said, and Mr Gong nodded.

“That would not be a flawed assumption. She has lost colleagues in some of the wars Earth has been involved in against other species. She also has a bone to pick with slavers.” Then he turned to Adam. “Somebody who doesn’t like you has made sure she became your judge. Because the whole trial should have been dismissed on standing. “

“Yes,” Min-Na said and looked at Adam, “What are you up too? They can’t arrest you when they don’t have jurisdiction over your system.” She said.

“Well, that’s not completely true, when he accepted the military outpost, then he accepted some Earth jurisdiction of the system. Still, if they went that route, it should have been a military tribunal, as he is a former marine.” Mr. Gong replied as Adam just watched them.

“Yes, that is correct. But then it should have been Major Garrison. Or Admiral Hicks, not the administrator. That made this case civil and not military.”

Adam shrugged, “Seems like somebody messed up. Who is the prosecutor?”

“Oh, I know him, Xavior Fry. Not much of a problem. One of those who bought his position. He is good, but like a dog chancing a bone, he will not see anything else coming.  He will most likely argue that Earth’s got jurisdiction when Adam approached Earth for colony status and, even after that, bought a slave pen, knowing it was illegal. Which I’m actually wondering about. Why would you do that?” Mr Gong said.

“What would you do if you walked past a group of children being marched into a slave pen to be sold to the highest bidder? I did what I could to save them and ensure that place stopped that business. That place is now selling droids for me, no more slaves, And if I could, they would be freed immediately. The children were, but all adults had to stay enslaved for a minimum of five standard years before they could be freed.  You have to understand that they have no jails. Instead, it is slavery.”

“All slaves are prisoners? Even the children?” Mr Gong said, and Min-Na shook her head lightly.

“No, anybody can become a slave. But all convicted criminals become slaves, the closest we have to prison is holding cells for awaiting trials.” She said, and he looked between them.

“But the children? How would they become slaves?” He was trying to grasp this, thinking of his own kids back home.

“Piracy or their parents are given a slave sentence,” Adam said. “This is why I ended up buying so many. I have a contract set up like a regular work contract. It includes sick days, vacation, work hours, pay for their work, and a place to stay and work offer when they are freed. They even got union rights, yet I don’t think they know what it is.”  

“The contract has become quite popular, actually; it's even used between regular employees and employers. It has become the golden contract they all want. And for unions, well that is a privilege few have been granted. To get his contract means you’re a valued member of the company or somebody you want to save. The funny thing is that it's such a simple solution to the slavery situation, yet nobody thought about it.” Min-Na said, and Adam shrugged.

“Anyway, I will provide the witnesses, and you have to present him in court. I will be with you and help with the cultural aspect of the situation. That is something they have completely ignored, yet as I can see from your laws, it should always be taken into account when dealing with such trials.” She said and  Mr Gong nodded.

“Yes, there are many precedences in these cases; the most famous are State vs. Statham and State vs. Johnson. Unfortunately, they can't be used here as those cases didn’t involve slavery. A whole new can of worms. “ Mr Gong looked at Adam.

“I was thinking more of the State Vs. Roberts.” Min-na said and Mr Gong looked at her then smiled.

“Of course, we can involve the other two as well. As her case involved breaking human law to preserve human ethical laws, it just becomes a matter of how much they can judge Mr Wrangler for using the Xeno law to preserve human ethical decrees. The big problem is that Mrs Agnivanshi might not care as she is fond of saying ‘The law is the law and feelings have no place in the court room.’” He said and Adam chuckled.

“What’s so funny?” Min-na said.

“She is forgetting the media. The trial is open, which means it will be broadcasted, and I have already paid for it to be sent all the way to Earth; you know how they love court drama.” He looked at Mr Gong, who looked confused, then facepalmed.

“You want to lose this case? Just to drive home the point and change the law?” He asked, and Min-Na looked at him.

“No, but if I have to, I will. I want to change the law. Freeing my slaves doesn’t stop slavery here? If the price is Dirt and a life in prison, then I will take it. It will hurt and I will hate every minute of being away from Evelyn and my kids, but how can I let them grow up in a galaxy where they can at any moment be snatched up and sold into slavery? I have to at least hope that if that happens, somebody will set heaven and hell in motion to free them and punish those who did it.”

They looked at him, and Min-Na chuckled. “You never change, always thinking about others when you should be thinking about yourself.”

“Oh, I am, If I’m going up against the system like this, then I will cheat.” He winks.

 

 

Evelyn looked at Roks and Vorts. “That was 5 tons? Okay, who stole it?”

“Nobody, it's all drunk up.” Roks said, and Evelyn cursed out.

“This is worse than his trial. Okay! Let's fix this. Vorts, please tell me you guys planted coffee beans.”

“Yes, but we are one month away from being able to produce the coffee.  These things take time.” He said and she cursed even more.

“How much longer will what we have last?” She asked.

“About two weeks at most,” Vorts said, and then Evelyn cursed again. 

“We are going to have a rebellion!” she said as she sank down in the chair.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\

I had remembered visiting this sub before so I quickly looked through some pictures and picked out a few.  Is there anything interesting here?  I think there are some handmade Germans in there and some of them have a matte finish and some feel like clay.  There were many many more of the colored marbles but I didn't know what to look for yet.  Looks like I've found yet another hobby and have some research to do,6,1739032092.0,Marbles,1,1.0,False

My wife and I visit them a few times a year, but we tend to stick close to home, mostly running errands or eating at nearby restaurants. There are only so many trips to Walmart, Econo, and the Outlets we can handle! I had planned to take them to Costco in Bayamón today, but we decided to postpone.

I'm looking for more exciting ways to connect with the island! We don’t mind driving a bit, but Arecibo is our home base. When the weather is nice, we occasionally stop by *La Poza del Obispo* and take a scenic drive down Route 681 for a bite to eat. At some point, my wife and I want to visit *Cueva del Indio*, but we haven’t made it there yet.

What are some *must-see* spots and experiences on the island's north side? Bonus points if they're accessible and enjoyable for older folks. We’d love to explore *fincas, haciendas*, or *agroturismo* tours, and a museum or two would be great as well.

Any recommendations for noteworthy restaurants or unique experiences?

I’m a big coffee lover and once tried to visit *Café Lareño's* hacienda and coffee shop, but they happened to be closed that day. I managed to pick up a few bags from their wholesaler’s office, but I’d love to try again or maybe check out other coffee tours.

We don’t really drink, but I’ve considered doing the *Ron del Barrilito* tour the next time we’re in Bayamón. That said, I doubt my parents would be too interested in that.

1ikr0ci,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveAndDeepspace/comments/1ikr0ci/lads_boys_as_perfumes/,LADS Boys As Perfumes,"https://preview.redd.it/0y4j3xgyrxhe1.png?width=2044&format=png&auto=webp&s=12108588ee038087e75ceb73b290c88abf33fb64

Perfumes are a hobby of mine. I love sniffing new stuff and associating scents to stuff in real life. I was thinking about what LADS boys would represent which perfumes for me so I decided to do this random thing that I chose 3 perfumes for each boy. I don't know if this type of stuff is allowed in the sub. I made this for fun and this is just my subjective opinions about them.

Xavier:

\-Tilia by Marc-Antoine Barrois: This perfume smells like a warm, sunny, summer day. Linden notes gives it a nostalgic feeling too. It's soft, warm, cozy, nostalgic and modern at the same time. Felt like this would suit Xavier.

\-Black Opium by YSL: This perfume is sickly sweet with a twist of coffee note. It's sweet but you can also sense the darkness and depth in it. I feel like this could represent Xavier's dark side with his sweet side.

\-Princess by Killian: Fluffy marshmallow scent with matcha twist. Again very sweet and fluffy but also fresh and addictive with matcha. It reminds me of him whenever I smell it. Name wise prince-princess theme suit him as well.

I was thinking about Mugler - Alien as well since name suits him but I think that scent doesn't really represent him.

Zayne:

\-Penguin by Zoologist: This perfume smells like cold and ice. I know it sounds weird but ice and cold really has a scent and it literally smells like it. It really suits Zayne in my opinion.

\-Mojave Ghost by Byredo: This is such a mysterious scent. It smells clean like a fresh laundry. It also smells like you are in your garden after a spring rain. It smells like jasmine after a while. A little bit woody and sweet but really comforting and soothing. Screams Zayne to me.

\-Libre Flower & Flames by YSL: This is a Libre flanker. At first you think it smells serious. Like an elegant, office worker, unapproachable woman. But after some time it smells really cozy and warm. It has a soothing effect. It reminds me how Zayne becomes sweet after you pass through his cold and serious surface.

Rafayel:

\-Vanilla Powder by Matiere Premiere: This perfume smells sweet and powdery. It's warm and cozy but it has darkness and depth in it. It's not a juvenile vanilla scent, it's very mature. It always reminds me of Rafayel's sweet and dark sides.

\-Nomade Naturelle by Chloe: This perfume is very sweet but also very mature. Due to the dates, mirabelle, and Egyptian Jasmine notes it gives me Middle Eastern vibes and I think it suits his backstory. There is also something melancholic about this perfume I can't put my finger on.

\-Squid by Zoologist: This perfume smells like under the sea. It's not your typical aquatic scent though. It's dark, mysterious, intriguing. Exactly like Rafayel.

Sylus:

\-Portrait of a Lady by Frederic Malle: Mature, dark, mysterious, intriguing with cozy and warm vibes. It's bold, it's spicy. It's majestic. Stunning. Smells like a royal lady or a mob wife. Definitely Sylus.

\-La Petite Robe Noire by Guerlain: This smells like a dark and mysterious cherry cola. Licorice note tones down the overall sweetness in this. Sylus to me is a sour or burning cherry note. Fun and addictive.

\-La Vie est Belle L'Elixir by Lancome: Raspberry, leather, liquor, cedarwood and violet. This is Sylus in a bottle to me. Very mature. Very dark. Very hypnotizing. Seductive. Not here to play games, means business kind of perfume.

Caleb:

\-Eden Juicy Apple by Kayali: A juicy apple scent but not only because of obvious apple note. This is bright, sparkly, juicy, nostalgic fruity scent. Smells like a warm summer day from your childhood. It represent Caleb's soft and bright side to me.

\-Hypnotic Poison by Dior: Forbidden fruit vibes. It hypnotizes you to sin. Sweet but so addicting. Alluring. Dangerous. Also smells comforting. Should you follow your desires or control yourself? Bitter almond and soft vanilla notes together reminds me of Caleb's dark side and his dark secrets.

\-Angel's Share by Killian: This perfume smells like a boozy apple pie. Opening strikes you with cognac note but after it calmes down, you get cozy cinnamon, tonka bean, vanilla, praline, sandalwood. It's alluring. It's gourmand. It smells like holiday. I think it suits Caleb very much.

February 9-15,"(in progress) Completed the end of the first week on my wacky schedule (regular work schedule plus two nights and alternate Saturdays). Holding over chicken stir fry from last week. Kids have gotten tired of Factor, so I’m in the hunt for another meal prep/delivery service. In the meantime, I’ll pick up stuff for them to make sandwiches of various types.

Projected cost is $110.22, as follows:

* $35.36 for dinners this week

* $33.45 for long-term items (garlic, cheese, peas, heavy cream, salt, butter, eggs, chives, thyme)

* $41.41 for other things (sundries, coffee creamer for work, bread, cold cuts, sliced cheese, etc.)

The menu (in no particular order):

* [Mongolian beef](https://www.tastemade.com/recipes/mongolian-beef-with-green-beans-squash) (sheet pan prep, very easy)

* Baked salmon and asparagus (another sheet pan prep, kids love it)

* [Chicken Milanese](https://coleycooks.com/chicken-milanese/) with broccoli (have leftover chicken breast from last week)

* [Steak stir fry](https://momsdish.com/steak-stir-fry) with chicken instead of steak

* [Chicken and stuffing casserole](https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/food-cooking/recipes/a40640960/chicken-and-stuffing-casserole-recipe/)

* Baked potato bar

* Takeout/delivery

It occurs to me that the menu variety is on the low side. If I get my butt in gear next week, I’ll try to find at least two crock pot recipes I can put together in the morning for the evenings I work. However, I am doing pretty well in terms of the protein variety, the incorporation of vegetables, and the menu acceptance by the kids.

The menu acceptance is important. My kids are not picky in terms of food acceptance, but won’t eat what isn’t tasty and made well. I look at some of the money-saving meals I had on my menu last year, and it doesn’t matter how much money I saved if the kids won’t eat it.",1,1739031806.0,u_DesignatedVictim,0,1.0,False

Her main Sub-Reddit and the numerous Facebook parody/satire/informative pages can break down all the (alleged) lies and mistruths in the post from 02/08/2025 above.

⏸️ Please note, that nowhere in this speech did she describe how she enriches the lives of her pets.  Once again, there is no mention of the care she provides for them.  

Saying you love an animal is not enough.  Actions speak louder than words.  For me, Alice, Birdie Mae, and Oliver deserve the best care.  After all, they have earned significant income for Kylea & Joe.  I'm waiting to see their ""love"" in action. 

Now that you've had time to look at all the posts in this Sub-Reddit, what do you think about the care these 3 pets receive?

1ikqrqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversalOrlando/comments/1ikqrqn/trip_report_both_parks_royal_pacific_parks_great/,"Trip Report (Both Parks + Royal Pacific) - Parks Great, Resort a Let Down","TL;DR; - The park is as great as it ever was (Velocicoaster is freaking incredible and Diagon Alley is still amazing), but I likely won't stay or dine on-property during future visits.

Context: My wife and I finished up a trip to Orlando last week, where we stayed two nights at the Royal Pacific in a club level room and had two days in the park with park-hopper. We did not have a car, so we ate all our meals in the resort area; in the park, in city walk or in the hotels. We had not been to Orlando in three years and during our prior trip (and trips prior to that), the Universal portion of our trip was always our favorite. Below are top of mind thoughts reflecting on the visit:

The Negatives

1. For being arguably their #2 most premium resort (I think Hard Rock is #1?), Royal Pacific leaves a lot to be desired. The rooms are small and dated, even at the club level; especially when compared to comparably priced rooms at different theme park's hotel.

2. I saw the posts before coming regarding bed bugs at Cabana Bay and Portofino, but I assumed they wouldn't be an issue at their #2 resort and certainly not in their club level rooms. Part of me thought they were fake and attempts to smear the resort. I guess I was wrong. On the morning of our checkout, I noticed a bright-red blood splatter stain in the bedsheet. I was ready to move on to the next resort and I didn't want it to ruin my experience, so I didn't investigate any further. I wasn't bitten, so I assume I had crushed one underneath the bedsheet in my sleep. 

3. The food across the board was disappointing, even in light of already lowered expectations. Orchid Court, Cowfish, Margaritaville, Burger Digs. Again, I compare this to the food we had while dining at another theme park, and it was a significant downgrade.

The Positives

1. The club level was border-line worth it. If I was forced to stay there again, I would probably spend the extra to get access. The staff were friendly and it was nice to be able to pop in for the various offerings. Free coffee, snacks, apps, beer and late-night treats was a real nice perk.

2. In line with my comment above, the staff at the resort and the parks were great across the board. I can't understate how important this can be and how different the experience would have been without that.

3. Our first ride of the trip as part of early entry was Velocicoaster. Holy cow, what a way to start the trip and our morning. Every ride after that across all the parks were a let-down in terms of raw thrill. My heart feels like it starts to race even now as I write this, over a week later. I am definitely going to miss that the ride!

4. While Hogsmeade has lost a bit of the immersion and magic I remember when I first visited it, Diagon Alley is still amazing. Walking through the brick wall and then staring up at the dragon over Gringott's is still as magical as it ever was.

1ikqrqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1ikqrqh/redcoffee_sonarqube_reporting_made_easy/,RedCoffee: SonarQube reporting made easy,"Hi everyone,

I’m excited to share a new update for [RedCoffee](https://pypi.org/project/redcoffee/), a Python package that generates SonarQube reports in PDF format, making it easier for developers to share analysis results efficiently.

**Motivation:**

Last year, while working on a collaborative side project, my team and I integrated SonarQube to track code quality. Since this was purely a learning-focused initiative, we decided to use the SonarQube Community Edition, which met our needs—except for a few major limitations:

* There was no built-in way to share the analysis report.
* Our SonarQube instance was running locally in a Docker container.
* No actively maintained plugins were available to generate reports.

After some research, I found an old plugin that supported PDF reports, but it had not been updated since 2016. Seeing no viable solution, I decided to build RedCoffee, a CLI-based tool that allows users to generate a PDF report for any SonarQube analysis, specifically designed for teams using the Community Edition.

I first introduced RedCoffee on [r/python](https://www.reddit.com/r/python/) around nine months ago, and I received a lot of valuable feedback. Some developers forked the repository, while others raised feature requests and reported bugs. This update includes fixes and enhancements based on that input.

**What's new in the recent update ?**  
An Executive summary is now visible at the top of the report. This will highlight the number of bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells and % of duplication. This is based on a feature request raised by an user on Github.  
The second one is a bug fix where people were facing issues in installing the library because the requests package was missing in the required dependency section. This was also raised by an user on Github.

**How It Works?**

Installing RedCoffee is straightforward. It is available on PyPI, and I recommend using version 1.1, which is the latest long-term support (LTS) release.

    pip install redcoffee==1.1

For those who already have RedCoffee installed, please upgrade to the latest version:  
`pip install --upgrade redcoffee`

Once installed, generating a PDF report is as simple as running:

    redcoffee generatepdf --host=${YOUR_SONARQUBE_HOST_NAME} \ --project=${SONARQUBE_PROJECT_KEY} \ --path=${PATH_TO_SAVE_PDF} \ --token=${SONARQUBE_USER_TOKEN}

This command fetches the analysis data from SonarQube and generates a well-structured PDF report.

**Target Audience:**  
RedCoffee is particularly useful for:

* Small teams and startups using SonarQube Community Edition hosted on a single machine.
* Developers and testers who need to share SonarQube reports but lack built-in options.
* Anyone learning Click – the Python library used to build CLI applications.
* Engineers looking to explore SonarQube API integrations.

**Comparison with Similar Tools :** There used to be a plugin called SonarPDF, but it has not been actively maintained for several years. RedCoffee provides a modern, well-maintained alternative.

1ikqrlm,https://i.redd.it/uqtuh5gmwxhe1.jpeg,"Three months in, 30lbs down","I lost 8lbs the first week, so my average is closer to 1.8lbs a week. 

The weight loss has been nothing short of amazing. 

Notable improvements:
I haven't had a migraine since I started this medication.  I haven't used my rescue meds in months.  
My hands had been swollen for years, post-COVID infection plus carpal tunnel from pregnancy - the swelling is gone.
I'm sleeping better
My energy levels are back to feeling like a ""normal"" person.  I'm keeping up with my kids better.
No food noise.  I still get hungry and have cravings, but I'm not thinking about food all the time.  I can cook or pack my kids lunches without the compulsion to have a little taste of everything.
Compulsive behaviors have lessened. I've been able to complete projects I've avoided for years around the house. 
No blood sugar spikes after eating.  I used to need an afternoon coffee, but I'm not getting that exhaustion I used to get.
I'm off my acid reflux meds.  
My constant sinus issues have cleared up - less inflammation?

Downsides
Still battling constipation.  I need Mag07 about once a week.
I've definitely lost some hair.  I'm 2 years postpartum, so it's especially distressing
Cold all the time- I'm wearing underlayers, added an extra duvet to my bed, in wool socks at all times and I'm still shivering.
Misc
Despite losing 30lbs, I'm still in the same size clothes, they just fit better and look better now.  


I have a business trip next month with 18 hours of flights and the last time I flew, the seatbelt was on the absolute largest it could be without needing an extender, and that was the final straw. I’m so excited to be able to fly without feeling like I’m crammed into a seat. That’s too small for me.  ",29,1739031206.0,Zepbound,4,0.98,False
1ikqrlj,https://www.reddit.com/r/obx/comments/1ikqrlj/first_tome_visitors/,First Tome Visitors,"Hello! 
Coming with a group of 7 in September (2 of which are toddlers, under 2 years of age.) 
None of us have been to OBX before. We’re looking for any and all suggestions! 
Activities, must see locations, good food, local coffee shops, etc. We are looking for a few “kid friendly” activities as well, but not every suggestion needs to revolve around the littles. 
We’re staying in Kill Devil Hills. Willing and able to travel. Only restriction is a shellfish allergy—we’re aware that almost every restaurant by the ocean will have shellfish, which is ok! Just please no recommendations for restaurants dedicated to seafood 😂 

Thanks so much!!  

Edit: For more context, here’s some interests from group members—Aquariums are cool, museums are boring. Exploring nature is fun, but not for hours on end. Night life is not important. Mini golf is fun. Animals are awesome. Souvenir shops rock. And anything the kids can do for a bit would be nice. ",2,1739031206.0,obx,8,0.75,False

1ikqrab,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1ikqrab/first_poly_heartbreak/,First Poly Heartbreak,"So I got to experience a wonderful person and have a great time all while feeling secure in my relationship with my NP. This was my first in practice poly anything. I have to celebrate that part of things. What sucks is this person I developed feelings for “put on pause” our relationship due to their NP’s feelings. Someone I never met. 

I feel for their partner and I understand the jealousy and mixed feelings but it’s frustrating. Before opening up things with my husband, we did therapy, read all the poly book recommendations, talked about our needs and wants, ect. When my NP goes on a date, I respect my meta’s time by leaving them alone or not blowing up their phone- and we have kids together too. Last night I had a date that I was super excited for, I had gushed to my NP and friends about, I spent all this time getting ready for and their NP had jerked around the night from a phone. 1. An hour before the date my person called me up and says they may have to cancel because their partner had a really bad day. Yes, my first thought was disappointment but I found comfort in the fact that they were being a good partner. If there was a big loss in my life(death, loss of job, something happened with kids ect), my NP going out on a hot date would be devastating. 
Their friends cancelled on them and didn’t want to go to an event alone. We had our date anyway but as we’re making out their phone starts blowing up. I get told that they need to cut the date short by 2 hours and they took me home. 

Now I woke up to a pause text, they are apologetic and all the things but this hurts. My nesting partner is taking me out for coffee and they came home after work and just held me. I’m grateful that I got to know them, I’m grateful that I have a great relationship with a very open minded husband, but wow. This is a new feeling.",4,1739031182.0,polyamory,3,1.0,False
