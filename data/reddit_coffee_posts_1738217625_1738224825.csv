With extra time in the mornings, I’ve taken to tidying our shared office, organizing papers, dusting his desk, refilling his coffee station, and even setting up a whiteboard for his schedule. He’s never asked me to do this, but he seems to appreciate it. However, one of his friends (mid-40s M) recently commented that I’m “babying” my husband and “taking away his independence,” saying a man should manage his own space. My husband has only expressed gratitude, but now I’m second-guessing myself. Am I being too controlling, or is his friend just projecting? Should I stop, or is this just an outsider’s weird take?

1idia3b,https://i.redd.it/7s7jrn91a3ge1.jpeg,The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer (With Music and Sound Effects from Twin Peaks),"Hello Dreamers,

Like many of you, I found Laura Palmer’s Diary after falling in love with the town of Twin Peaks, after feeling a desire to understand more about the mysterious Laura. I‘ve felt very deeply for Laura since seeing the pilot, beautiful, pale and cold.. wrapped in plastic, to going deeper into this heartbreaking Jane Doe’s story. Finding her diary and reading it brought us closer than many of us could believe we could be to her. 

While listening to the amazing audiobook (wow Sheryl Lee, WOW) I would hear songs from the show and movie in my head that would fit the current energy of that journal entry.
With all that said, for a number of years now I’ve been working on a personal project that’s exactly that.

It’s basically a version of Laura Palmer’s Diary with music from Twin Peaks. It’s every journey entry in the book, separated into different tracks, with the titles of each track being the date of each journal entry. 
I never intended or planned to release it quite honestly. It’s far from professional, but being that it was something I planned to put on my iPod and drift away to at night, it does the trick for me.

I guess I’m just kind of testing the waters here.. is this something anybody would be interested in hearing? I have basically zero idea how to “distribute” (google drive, one drop? Idek) but it’s all finished and ready to be heard. Again, far from professional work here. I’m a musician in my free time, and my dream is to create soundtracks for movies.(dream big, kid)
Additionally, if somebody out there entertains the idea of checking it out, I’d love any kind of feedback on mistakes (music too loud, sound effects too distracting, mixing issues, etc)

Thank you for reading this, I hope your next coffee is as black as a moonless night!",1,1738224557.0,twinpeaks,0,1.0,False

The blending of flavors and recipes creates a culinary identity that locals proudly embrace.

I drive with my knees and sort totes with my hands while driving. I'm out of the truck, running uphill, throwing the packages like an Olympic Frisbee player, snapping pics like National Geographic with a telephoto lens, and back in the truck driving with my knees in under 15 seconds. I sacrifice my breaks because why take a break when I can rescue someone and get another 300 stops in that hour. I broke my knee yesterday but I just wrapped it tight with some old totes, it should hold till atleast tmrw, hopefully it doesn't get infected. No time to use the bathroom so I just rehydrate by drinking my own piss but I'm really fast, I always do it while driving. When I RTS, I clock out before driving back because I don't want them to have to pay me for the privilege of returning the truck. I also pay for the gas with my own credit card, but I use their fleet points card so they get the points. If a customer complains for any reason, I let them slap me 5 times or belt me twice. They told me they'd give me 3 shifts a week, but 4 shifts if I work at 5th shift for free, I said give me 4 shifts and I'll work 7 days a week, like 3 for free. So now I work everyday, but only get paid for 4 days a week. I'm just really lucky to be able to wear their uniforms. I still have my original uniform, it's really ragged now and they offered me a new uniform, but I was just happy with permission to fill my coffee cup with water from the toilet. It could be worse, my friend got their hand stuck in the conveyor belt in the warehouse, and when the operations manager was about to hit the emergency stop, he just screamed ""No!!! We can't slow down the packages!!"", so his hand was fully torn off but luckily it landed straight in a garbage bin, and not a customer's package. He told me if it had landed in a prime package, he'd be so ashamed he would have sacrificed himself right there and then. After they stopped the bleeding by wrapping it in old totes, they offered him the rest of the day off, unpaid. But he felt so bad because of the blood on the totes, that he just worked the rest of his shift plus OT, but made sure to edit his timecard to say he clocked out when he lost his hand. He wanted to show his dedication to the team. It's not all about the money for us. We really want to help Amazon fulfill their dedication to stopping world hunger, disease, and poverty. Without Amazon giving us purpose and proper guidance in life, we would would just be lost. Times are hard. The first 2 weeks of January my DSP said they had to reduce number of drivers and instead give extra packages to the remaining drivers in order to increase their profits. I cried, more like bawled my eyes out for the hardships they had to endure. So I just worked those full 14 days without clocking in at all. My DSP was so grateful. I remember the owner sitting there and saying thank you, they were so happy that they gave me a special pin to put on my shirt. It wasn't a real pin, it was one of those smiley face stickers you find in kids cereal boxes. I think mine was from the 80's cause the glue didn't work, or maybe it was my ragged shirt. My wife and I decided to have an abortion because taking a day off delivering packages for the birth wouldn't be fair to our DSP. She works there too, it was totally her decision, but I knew she would make the right choice. The other day my credit card didn't work when gassing up the truck, so I drove 2 blocks to my grandma's house and siphoned her gas tank to fill the truck. I was really thirsty though so atleast the gas moistened my mouth a bit. I would keep writing but I'm in the hospital seeing my friend who finally went to see if they can stop the infection from taking his whole arm. The guy who lost his hand. He's really screaming in pain now so I'm thinking of just taking him back to work, I'll make sure to check his rabbit in case he tries to clock in, today is one of his free days and I keep reminding him of his privilege to work his days off without pay. I had the doctor install a pacemaker in him, too, but to zap him hard whenever he feels sleepy at work. But I'm proud of him, the DSP actually has him on a special conveyor belt now where he uses a hand and a foot to pack things and his packing count is back to normal. I had a talk with the DSP owner though and we agreed that if we can't increase his packing count by 50% a week from here, that we'll both resign and refund all the paychecks we've had over the years. 

Damn they just gave him some morphine for the pain, but I guess the DSP owner can zap him when I get him to the station. I'm doing a 24 hour route tonight. I'm aiming for 10,000 stops, since they've given me an 18 wheeler Semi. I'll definitely be running up those driveways cause it can be really hard to turn around and 18 wheeler in some driveways. I tried a few times but I went an inch onto someone's lawn and felt so bad that I let them slap me an extra 5 times and belt me 4 times, but they didn't have a belt, so I let them strangle me with a ripped tote. But it was quite hard to drive after regaining consciousness, so i try to avoid that now. God Bless DSP's and Amazon. I cry just typing Amazon.

# Airports & Itinerary Planning

Costa Rica has two main international airports:

* **Liberia Airport (LIR)** – Best for visiting the Pacific Coast and Northern regions.
* **San Jose Airport (SJO)** – Central location, better for accessing the Caribbean coast and southern areas.

# Itinerary Tip

Consider flying into one airport and departing from the other for a more efficient travel route, depending on the destinations you plan to visit.

# Recommended Itinerary

# If Landing in Liberia (LIR):

* 2-3 nights on Papagayo Peninsula (Luxury, coastal experience)
* 2-3 nights in La Fortuna (Rainforest, volcano, hot springs)

# Other Areas to Consider:

* Santa Teresa – Coastal, laid-back, surf town
* Jaco – Hipster vibe, nightlife, surfing
* Tamarindo – Young crowd, party scene, surfing
* Manuel Antonio National Park – Wildlife, beaches, adventure
* Monteverde – Cloud forest, great for hiking (rough roads, 4WD recommended)
* Drake Bay, Puerto Viejo, Uvita – Unique, beautiful, off-the-beaten-path destinations

# Car Rental Recommendations

# Should You Rent a Car?

* **Yes** – Provides flexibility, but driving conditions can be challenging.

# Recommended Car Rental Companies:

* **Adobe** or **Vamos** (local, transparent pricing)
* **Book through local sites** (e.g., Hertz.cr instead of Hertz.us) for accurate pricing.

# Mandatory Fees & Avoiding Hidden Charges:

* **Third-Party Liability Insurance** ($15-30/day) is required by law.
* **Avoid third-party booking websites** – They often double the quoted price and require high credit card holds (thousands of dollars). Third-party websites can still be cheaper but can be more frustrating due to lack of transparency for fees.

# Car Recommendations:

# Recommended Itinerary

# If Landing in Liberia (LIR):

* 2-3 nights on Papagayo Peninsula (Luxury, coastal experience)
* 2-3 nights in La Fortuna (Rainforest, volcano, hot springs)

# Other Areas to Consider:

* Santa Teresa – Coastal, laid-back, surf town
* Jaco – Hipster vibe, nightlife, surfing
* Tamarindo – Young crowd, party scene, surfing

* Monteverde – Cloud forest, great for hiking (rough roads, 4WD recommended)

# Mandatory Fees & Avoiding Hidden Charges:

Its my opinion the greatest of Twin Peaks comes in the little moments in the town. The Double R Diner. All the interactions at the police station. Cooper drinking coffee. Ben biting into a sandwich.  But I think people make the mistake of trying to get all the answers at once. They try to skip past the sweetness of the town and the show to get answers. Finding Laura's killer was never even the point of the show. Realizing light and darkness will always encompass each other is. A heavenly place like Twin Peaks will always attract darkness. I'm fairly certain a lot of Lynchs work probably has that message. 

Anyways. Then you have Harold Smith. A guy legitimately in love with Twin Peaks. Who's unable to leave. Trapped like Lynch probably felt. He's exceedingly sweet and his only hobby is growing beautiful flowers and writing other people's stories (the same way Lynch was probably in love with the sweetness of the town and writing everyone's stories) The other characters desperately want to know who killed Laura so badly they attempt to steal his Diary (Lynch's script?) 

He ends up confronting them and saying something like ""are you so desperate to know all the secrets?"" Which feels like Lynch directly confronting the audience. And then shortly after the killer is revealed he died which is the exact point Lynch left the show.

1idhkgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1idhkgl/after_a_complete_rewatch_including_the_missing/,"After a complete rewatch (including The Missing Pieces), some theories I have.  This is long.","BOB: BOB’s main goal is to join his golden orb with the Fireman/Laura’s golden orb.  This will allow him to be untethered to the Black Lodge.  When he fails, he decides to use the doppelgänger to stay out of the lodge as long as possible including creating Dougie to take his place when he is called back.  The doppelgänger is separate of BOB, but carries his golden orb.  BOB doesn’t need to take over in the same way as he did with Leland since the doppelgänger is quite adept at causing pain and death, so BOB is along for the ride.  Knowing that he sexually assaulted Audrey, Diane, and had sex with various females in his circle, the question does arise if William Horne has any half-brothers or sisters.

The Frog Insect: The insect was born of an egg from the same vomit that produced BOB.  It is still tethered to The Experiment’s realm as shown when Sarah takes off her face.  The insect’s goal in life is to assist BOB in joining his orb with the Fireman/Laura’s orb.  It does this by crawling into Sarah Palmer’s mouth while she is a teenage girl and finding Leland, who is carrying BOB around inside him.  Whether they create Laura in natural ways (sexy times) or create a type of clone off of Carrie Page’s DNA (like hair), they are able to bring the Fireman/Laura’s orb to earth.  After BOB fails his goal of joining orbs, the insect has no purpose, so it uses alcohol and tobacco to stay in control of Sarah.  When Sarah starts to sober up, she has her breakdown in the shop, forcing the bug to get aggressive in its’ control of her.  When Cooper saves Laura, insect Sarah goes crazy as she can not destroy the thing she came to Earth to destroy as evidenced by her being unable to destroy the picture, even stabbing at it with objects.

What’s going on with Cooper as Dougie: For the past 25 years, Cooper has been in different realms like the Black Lodge and with The Fireman.  These realms have no free will for humans, so Cooper was being lead around and told what to say.  Even when he is going back to our realm, he needs to be pushed in the direction by different beings.  Once he is back in our realm, he is not used to having free will, so he just stands around, waiting for a force to push him in one direction or the other.  Sometimes, it’s Mike/Philip or another otherworldly force.  Sometimes, it’s other human beings literally pushing him.  This is why he only repeats what other people say.  Certain things like coffee or the police badges remind him of the past, but he still needs some time to break 25 years of conditioning.

What is Laura: as alluded to, Laura might be more than a human being.  We have doppelgängers and tulpas, so there is the possibility that Laura was created to bring the orb to life.  Maddie might be another creation in the same mold as Laura from Carrie Page as Odessa is close to New Mexico (less than five hours from White Sands).  When Cooper saves Laura, we don’t see her fly off in the same way as the Diane Tulpa, but she we do see her fly off in that exact same way later in the Black Lodge, making me think she’s not quite human.  Putting on the ring brought Laura to the Black Lodge instead of allowing BOB to take her over.  As we saw, just because the body dies, the orb can remain with the woodsmen doing whatever they do to bring the body back to life.  Even if Laura had killed herself before BOB took her over, she’d just be brought back to life, so the ring was the only way to keep her away from BOB while keeping her spirit around.  Carrie Page screams at the end because she hears Sarah’s voice, realizing that she has had dreams of Laura’s life, a link between her and the being created from her.

Copper’s Ending: Cooper has followed in the footsteps of Jeffries and is now traveling between space and timelines.

1idhfu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1idhfu4/is_this_the_catholic_view_on_discerning_marriage/,Is this the Catholic view on discerning marriage? 💍,"☩ 𝐈𝐍 𝐍𝐎𝐌𝐈𝐍𝐄 𝐏𝐀𝐓𝐑𝐈𝐒, 𝐄𝐓 𝐅𝐈𝐋𝐈𝐈, 𝐄𝐓 𝐒𝐏𝐈𝐑𝐈𝐓𝐔𝐒 𝐒𝐀𝐍𝐂𝐓𝐈:

I’m a 23-y/o man at the stage of life to discern my vocation, which I strongly believe to be to receive the Sacrament of Matrimony and faithfully serve our 𝐋𝐎𝐑𝐃 as a loving husband and father to my wife and kids.

Of course, all of my friends are also planning for the rest of their lives, including marriage (though sadly none of them are Catholic). For them, this means pursuing women in the way the world demands in the disastrous aftermath of the Sexual Revolution. One of them (a lapsed evangelical Protestant, by their fruits you shall know them) was telling me “hit up some chicks with us bro, we can wingman you” (cringe). I told him I have no interest in meeting girls at nightclubs; when he asked where I’d meet a woman, I merely responded with absolute confidence: “Moment of serendipity. I guarantee it.” He dropped the subject.

Later, I was talking to someone else I know about this (I don’t care what he is, but he sure as hell isn’t Catholic). He AGREED with my friends. This was my response:

> **What I will say is this:**  
> If you’re not Catholic, you wouldn’t get it. We are all part of God’s universal call to holiness. Some answer this call and believe in Him. The specific calls for each believer are vocations. For most, this is to receive the Sacrament of Matrimony. Should this be a one’s vocation, the Holy Spirit will guide any Catholic to fruition so long as they are faithful to Him. One must still cooperate with this grace (e.g., you can’t be a total slob who never goes outside), but there will be divine intervention within the natural order in such a manner that is comprehensible to but not explained by natural reason. One might call this is a moment of serendipity (e.g., meeting a girl in a coffee shop by pure chance who’s also a devout Catholic and has not engaged in the degeneracy of the postmodern secular order).
>
> We are to be in this world but not of this world. Even before becoming a faithful Catholic, I knew by the light of natural reason that this world is truly rotten. Then, I lamented. Now, I am hopeful. I know that participating in the inorganic, formulaic dating rituals of the age which reduce human souls to mere objects is no way for a Catholic to live. It is no way for any moral agent to live. Therefore, I reject it. Amen.

Furthermore:

> Already said you have to cooperate with God’s grace, which includes everything you mentioned. You said “they are right” in reference to clubbing, which is almost always a near of occasion of sin (not for me because I have no interest in it to begin with).
>
> In simpler terms, a Catholic (and perhaps other Christians) need not *actively* date in search of a partner. We can *passively* date (i.e., be open to these moments of serendipity by leading a lifestyle conducive to it). Be hygienic, well-groomed, sharply dressed, physically fit, socially competent, and disciplined in your purpose. Do not waste time on dating apps, in nightclubs/bars, etc. It’s that simple. Not sure what about this is controversial to you ¯\\_\(ツ)\_/¯

To further justify this belief, I pointed out that peer-reviewed scientific research published in academic journals confirms that devout Catholic couples have the happiest marriages, which suggests that the Holy Spirit gifts them with a charism shielding them from
the tumults which plague non-Catholic marriages. We all know this.

My question is whether or not my assurance is in line with Church teachings. To be abundantly clear, I’m *not* saying that being devoutly Catholic means God will just bring the perfect spouse to your doorstep. Of course you have to actually be worthy, which includes being the kind of person a devout Catholic would want to date/marry. That said, is it true that the Holy Spirit will make things way easier for us? Can we just focus on living lives of virtue and that God will introduce us to another one of His children, or must we actively pursue them?

Context:

Making friends as an introvert can be a daunting task, especially in environments where social circles are already established. As someone who prefers meaningful conversations over small talk, I often find it challenging to connect with new people. Working in a government office, I have noticed that most of my colleagues already have their own groups, making it even harder for me to find my place.

At 30 years old, single, and dedicated to my career as a lawyer, I sometimes feel the weight of solitude. It’s not that I don’t enjoy my own company, because I do. But like everyone else, I crave companionship, someone to share thoughts with, laugh with, and simply enjoy life’s moments. The problem is, approaching people isn’t easy when you’re an introvert.

So, I’m taking a step forward. If anyone is interested, let’s have coffee. No pressure, no forced conversations, just a casual meet-up where we can get to know each other. Whether you’re an extrovert looking to befriend an introvert or someone who understands the struggle of making new connections, I’d love to meet you.

1idhadv,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1idhadv/space_karens/,SPACE KARENS,"One of the biggest commodities sold in the galaxy was organs. The Qualm are the largest supplier.

  Where do they get them? Who knows. There are rumors. What I do know is this: it isn't really cost effective to raise organisms for their viscera. Whether that be farming or clone mills, the resources put into raising the stock adds a lot to the overhead.

  It's much cheaper to acquire them from other methods.

  Of course, we do business with all sorts of specialists in addition to the Qualm. Some of them are likely small scale abduction rings, some simply broker organs acquired from prison planets. A few even grow them in labs, but those can be unpredictable.

  Once again, I do not know where the Qualm gets them. I've never even seen a Qualm. Nobody has, as far as I know.

  I have seen their minions. It is quite obvious that they are manufactured. Their brokers are vaguely human, but they are featureless. They communicate via a machine on their wrists, not unlike a watch, that apparently translates their brain waves. There does not seem to be a language they don't know.

  These brokers tend to wear a darker human business suit, with a black tie and bowler hat. Occasionally, they are seen in Vugiferan merchant attire, the familiar white cloak and hood with a gold belt, but it is becoming rare.

  Their soldiers...are a mess. There really isn't a standard form, although most have any number of tentacles. Typically an odd number. Their bodies are a chimera of various parts stitched together, an alien child of Victor Frankenstein and David Cronenberg.

  Most of these soldiers are able to communicate, but it's typically with each other or the brokers. The language isn't recorded in any archive I've seen.

  As for why the brokers tend to wear human attire? They seem to have quite a connection to earth. Organs from that planet are high dollar items. Once again, I don't know how they get them. That planet is completely locked down, and anyone that attempts to mess with it is destroyed. The human leader and his personal bodyguard seem to take great enjoyment from coming up with ironic ways to commit genocide.

  Yeti lungs, tyrannosaurus livers, vampire hearts. I've even seen Skinwalker pelts. Some of those creatures don't even live on earth anymore. The dinosaurs are extinct on earth and every other planet as far as anyone can tell, yet their parts show up on the markets. I can't reiterate enough that I have no idea how the Qualm acquires its assets.

  Anyhoo, that's enough fuckin background, I think. You likely aren't here for any of that. And some of this information might not be entirely relevant, and I'm possibly risking my job (and my organs) by disclosing some of that information.

  My name is Jack, and I'm a human. I was born and have spent my entire life on a space station in the Yavikian sector. A little slice of chaos affectionately called ""New Dubai"". I do not know why we call it that, it does not resemble the city on earth in any form, and its old enough that nobody knows when it was built. I am completely non-augmented, so I live out in the open.

  I work at Glorp!, the Galaxy's premier organ retail center. I mostly run the front desk, online orders are all automated, unless they choose the ""store pickup"" option of course. I mostly deal with the cash-only, no records type of clientele.

  One particular day, I had just nuked my cup o' worms and made another beaker of coffee, when a Drexian walked in. This was weird.

  Drexians were a militant reptilian race. They were known for enslaving entire planets and paying off the galactic federation to look the other way. They were also known for being stuck in an off and on war with a bunch of octopi known as Uval'ans. Currently, they were known as the race that no longer had any leadership.

  Their king had been murdered by an augmented human, and their entire territories were stricken into chaos. Nobody had seen any of them this far out. Quite a few had turned up as refugees in Verillian space.. but it was incredibly odd to see just one way out here. But New Dubai brought all kinds so of course I remained professional.

  ""Item 473"" the thing squawked. I was somewhat kerfuckled, and it must have sensed that. I'd never heard of item 473. 472 was a human left eye with the optic nerve intact. 474 was a basilisk gizzard. I'd never thought about what 473 would be.

  Of course, I wasn't required to memorize every item, there was a database pos system. I just...kind of took pride in my knowledge of our wares. Caught me off guard for a second or two.

  ""Do you not have it then?"" It said, obviously frustrated but making a pretty solid attempt to not make a scene. ""Well sir, this item must be a rare item. Let me look it up and check. If I don't have it, I'm sure I can get it. It has a stock number"".

  I typed in 473 in the guid number field, and it took a few aggravating seconds to load.
... SIBERIAN UNICORN HORN...INQUIRE INTERNALLY FOR AVAILABILITY AND PRICE...

  I had never heard of a Siberian unicorn. I opened a search window and found it was an extinct earth mammal. Being human, I probably should have known this, but earth history wasn't required learning out here and I've never personally been to earth. I sighed, turning my first monitor around so the customer could see it. The illusion of transparency was paramount to Glorp!.

  ""I need this today. I do not have time to wait on your management. Anywhere that you could have this shipped from would be accessible by me anyway. Good day to you. Do you validate?"" the reptile added. I nodded, and stamped him out. He was... honestly pretty chill about it. Rumors of Drexians are so far grossly unfounded.

   Things had slowed down enough that I was doom scrolling the local space craigslist. I was sick of taking the train back and forth from my condo in the crown, and was looking for transportation. Something nice but modest. A hover mode would be nice, ground traffic was abysmal down here at times. I drank with enough of the elite that I'm sure I could secure some basic air clearance through a bribe.

   A Vrillin walked in, practically kicking the door like he was motherfukkin' shaft. ""I want a refund!"" He yelled. Finally looking up at him, I could see the yellow coloration of his skin that suggested jaundice. Trying to hide my amusement, I asked him for his order number or a receipt. Most customers paid cash, those did not receive a receipt.

   ""Fine! Its 72135! This liver is defective!"" the bastard yelled at me. Of course I looked up his order. I had to tell him. ""Three days ago you purchased a pancreas, one from a different species at that. A human pancreas cannot accommodate the full function of a Vrillin liver. The notes on the order show that my associate told you of this, and that there would be no refunds"".

  Fuming, he proceeded to explain how we were out of the correct item, and a website said that it would work. I explained to him that like a website, medical advice from my associates and I could not be trusted, but that information was largely correct. It would keep him alive, but he would still be full of toxins. I also explained that his body was much more efficient than mine, and he could get free treatments at the local clinic. Should only need one a month, every other month with the human pancreas.

  Obviously, he would have none of that. Dude completely lost his shit, called me all kinds of horrible words. Nothing I hadn't heard before. To be honest, I had resumed my search for an automobile and wasn't being entirely professional. I even looked up at the cc screen, in the single customer parking space was a newer luxury sedan. This guy was not struggling, as I figured. Other than him looking like a reject from the Simpsons, he was well groomed and dressed nicely. I let him go off for a while, despite my feelings about him, I get it. Healthcare can be a bitch, especially in a place like this. We don't even have doctors for all the species that could possibly live here. Vrillins were not a common race.

  After he knocked my vase off of the desk, the one with the lilies, I finally looked back at him. ""Alright, tell you what"" I said. ""We can offer partial compensation upon receiving the receipt from your surgeon. If he's reputable enough, we can cover that surgery and a subsequent one"". He went silent. As expected, it was installed by a veterinary robot in a booth at a mall. Guy was not struggling, he was a cheap ass. Obviously there is nothing wrong with being frugal, but I'm not going to consider the consequences of another's choices as an emergency.

  After I told him to leave, he threw another fit and proceeded to stomp and swear, calling me every racial slur they had for a human, my favorite being ""Ape descendant"". That one always made me laugh. Like really? Bitch, you evolved from crabs.

  Anyway, I had enough. ""DUDE!"" I yelled. He stopped, I had his full attention. I followed up with ""See that round rug you are stomping on? Yeah? Its a trap door. See this red button next to my coffee maker? It drops you down to the laboratory. Where do you think we get all these organs?"" He paused, went to say something, and decided against it. He left without incident.

  That was all a goddamn fabrication of course. When I said I didn't know where our units came from, I meant it, for the most part anyway (I've acquired a few here and there. I assure you they all deserved it). Under that rug was a hole in the carpet. It was worn from years of people stomping in that same spot, and it was unsightly. That carpet is very expensive, takes time to locate a replacement for it. Takes longer to get it shipped out here, management was not about to allow us to just print a cheap copy, either. The cheap rug we used to hide said hole came from SpaceMart or some shit, it took weeks of constant back-and-forth emails to convince them it was necessary. 

  Oh, the red button unlocks the bathroom. Can't have junkies just waltzing in there and overdosing. This isn't some convenience store on a slab in the outer ring.

  The rest of the shift went normally up to a point. Couple hearts, lungs, a phlargalm. Nothing out of the ordinary. I even sold a Therl'kin femur. I tried to toss that thing like seven times running out-lists, but the management kept telling me to leave it in the freezer. Guess they were right. Guy was practically salivating when I handed it to him. I don't know what he was, but he looked like a demon, if you can believe that.

  Sure enough, I was vacuuming my area right before closing when the bell dinged and a customer walked in. Of course my thoughts were along the lines of ""Fuck. Space Karen is going to ask for some stupid bullshit and keep me over half an hour. Home office is going to shit on me for the overtime"".

  She was human, and rather striking. Tall, well dressed, glimmering red hair. Definitely business district ...I could go on but I'm not a private investigator and this isn't noir.

  ""Sorry, I flew down here as fast as I could. Order 74596, it's already paid for"". Flew? Ya. She was rich. Most people on New Dubai took transit or drove wheeled vehicles. Airspace required expensive permits on a space station. Glancing at the cc monitor, I saw an Invicta 740. Single seater luxury fighter, class 90A. Damn. She had chedda.

  Online order though. Placed by a representative of the Qualm empire itself. Holy fucktarts. This unit was so rare, the Qualm themselves didn't have one in their.. warehouses or.. whatever they had. So I wouldn't be tacking on any pointless service fees. Dang. I'm allowed and even encouraged to skim a bit off the top in these situations, but it was paid in full.

  Item 473. The horn of a Siberian unicorn. What the actual fuck. We did have one? I could have sold it to the Drexian for twice what her benefactors paid. They must have ordered it two minutes before he arrived. What the fuck ever. I went in the back and found it in the willcall spot. I could have sworn it wasn't there earlier. We really only have two employees most weeks, Rysh'ad works my days off. We know this space like a politician knows massage parlor locations.
   
   Her phone rang as I was boxing the unit. Quaint. Most people used wrist phones or implants, hers was an ancient Nokia. Was probably a print, but judging by her transportation it very well could have been authentic.

  Like most rich assholes, she had to place the call on speaker. Because of our reputation, or maybe her narcissism, she obviously didn't give nine craps what I heard.

  A horrid, snakelike voice on the other end said  ""Plans have changed Abarinth. You are still to meet the vampire in sector 19 outside of human territory, but they will not be aboard the dreadnought Vengeance. In its stead will be a pirate vessel, the infamous Defying Dutchman. They know everything, my dear. Everything. They thwarted a plan of mine to acquire an interesting assortment of stock. You are to deliver the horn and issue a full refund. Have them sign nondisclosure form 17a. The vampire will honor it. The pirate and his insectoid first mate will not, I fear"".

  The woman, Abarinth apparently, responded, saying ""Understood. This will be the triple of my usual rate. Much more if you expect me to take out the pirate"".

  The gentleman on the other end, whom I assumed to be a snaky merchant, only followed up with ""Unnecessary. He has many enemies. We will figure it out. The collective is not overly concerned"". She then looked at her phone, giggled, and pressed the red ""end call"" button, with zero embarrassment.

   She left quickly after I handed her the unit, and I mean it when I say quickly. She nosed straight up and rocketed right off of the station. No security drones followed her as she approached the atmospheric shield, either. Serious chedda.

   After that, I finished with my vacuum and went to the back to grab my lunch pail. Luckily I still had a sandwich in there, the train to the crown was a long one, I wouldn't be home for another hour. And then I heard the bell. Fuck. I should have locked the door when I turned off the ""sorry, we're open"" sign.

  I came around the corner facing the barrel of a plasma pistol. A cheap one, at that. Some type of print. Great, a junkie.

  ""Everything from the register, now!"" Yelled the junkie as he tossed a cute shopping bag at my face. Fucking asshole. He certainly was an addict of some sort, probably Stigg. Guy smelled like the piss of a Schluggorp Whivvelbeast after a breakup binge of asparagus and prison asteroid pruno.

  I didn't even put my hands up. Just fucking shoot me, whatever is left will get a day off. I just nodded and went to the register. All the cash goes straight to the safe, but we keep a couple hundred in there for these situations. There is also the worm. In the tray that typically held the tens was an assortment of 0010 fire worms.

  Simply put, a fire worm is not actually a worm. It's not even an annelid. It is closer to a plant. They are cultivated in the flesh pits centered in the fields of sorrow, located on an unnamed moon in what is affectionately known as the death cluster. A robotic hive culture farms all kind of interesting organics there. The sole purpose of anything they grow is death. They sell all types of fun products that kill in exciting ways. If you've been the victim of a war crime, good chance the pathogen was grown there, and someone paid a pretty penny for your misfortune.

  Anyway, I pinched the seedpod off of the stalk and placed it into the bag with the cash. I wasn't even careful or sneaky about it. The stigghead was shaking and sweating so profusely there was no way he was concentrating fully. ""Here you are, and thank you for choosing Glorp! for all your degenerate needs"" I said as I handed him the sack.

  I stepped back one, two, three steps, and not all that quickly. Druggie opened the bag, of course. Bad move. Well, would have been. He was distracted enough that I probably could have wrestled the gun from him... but I didn't. Instead the worm exploded, destroying most of his head and a few fingers. I finished my coffee and calmly drug his body to the freezer, grabbed my new plasma pistol, and sent corporate an email about the new human organs that would need tested and extracted, and how we would need a cleanup before opening tomorrow. Rysh'ad and I do not get paid enough to clean druggie brain matter out of high quality carpet. Especially after I already vacuumed.

Standing out on that deck as the ferry drifted through an infinite expanse of stars, was by far the most out of body I have ever felt. I could not comprehend how this was happening. I shouldn’t have even been alive out there, yet somehow I was able to breathe and move just as I normally would. Whether by some magical confines of the ever mysterious vessel, or some universal spell I was under, I still don’t know. I slowly paced around the deck, taking in the awe inspiring views all around me. Making my way around to the upper front deck, I looked out to the Portside of the ferry and had to steady myself, as I saw a massive glowing white ball which appeared to be so close to us I could have jumped off and floated right to it.

It took me a few moments to realise it. I was staring at our Moon. I was dumbstruck, it was so close! Right there! I turned back around, gazing out over the Starboard side, and I noticed that Earth was directly in my line of sight now. I turned back around, there was the moon to my left. Looking back again, there’s Earth off to my right. Something happened to me in that moment. This was entirely wrong. My mind, it simply could not compute the orientation. The moon should be above me. Earth should be below my feet. It also dawned on me in that moment, I was seeing Earth to my right, where it was below me earlier. We must have been slowly spinning around as we drifted through the Galaxy. Again, I couldn’t mentally process this. I began to feel incredibly dizzy, and I fell to the ground, unable to pick myself back up. I had to crawl my way back inside, sliding open the door and dragging myself to one of the only remaining empty rows of seats that were not yet occupied by the nothing-people.

Sitting back in my seat now, I just looked out the window, watching the celestial light show outside. If I wasn’t already, I was pretty dam sure now that I was not getting off this boat… ever. I felt a sense of peace in that moment, like I didn’t have try so hard anymore. There was a feeling of acceptance, followed by a mix of sadness and regret. I thought back to that night. What if I had just taken a cab instead? It was midnight, what on earth was I even thinking taking a ferry back home at that hour anyway? Money, of course. It was always about money. Not in this moment it wasn’t. All of that seemed quite unimportant now. I just… watched. As literal space and time passed by before my very eyes. Before long, my eyes became heavy, and I could keep them open no longer…

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*“Attention passengers! The café service is now open! Please form a line, do not rush, do not push. Everybody will be served in due time.”*

The announcement from the P.A. system ripped me out of my slumber, signalling the return of my one and only friendly companion. I watched as the masses of nothing-people and strange humanoids began their march toward the café. The ferry was almost full now, and there was a constant stream of them shuffling and stuttering their way up the stairs and towards the counter. One by one they placed their orders, collecting cups of coffee, hot pies, fresh sandwiches and slices of cake, before slowly making their way back down and filling up the empty seats once again.

I decided to wait until things calmed down a bit. I didn’t want to go anywhere near these things. The tall, pointy limbed ones which had boarded the ferry in the mangrove swamp yesterday were now clicking their way up the stairs, and I cringed back a little as they emerged at the top, their faces coming into view for the first time. They were downright horrible. Long, puffy faces that seemed permanently crafted into vicious looks of sheer hatred. I looked away, resigning myself to just waiting until I heard the crowds disperse. I could hear Café Guy struggling to keep up with all this, yet his overtly positive attitude never once faltered. He still hummed Kumbaya as he went about his duties, and I now smiled at the sound of that tune, where it once kinda weirded me out. If he could keep his spirits up, maybe I could too.

I sat back, waiting my turn. Slowly but surely, in amongst noises I cannot even accurately put into words, I heard the crowd beginning to thin, and I chanced a look back in the direction of the café. There were only about five or six passengers now, waiting in line to be served. At the front of the line stood a short little thing, no taller than a child of maybe five years old. His form was scrawny, save for his gigantic head, and I wondered how he actually stayed upright. It looked as though he should be toppling over every step. While this thing resembled a child in stature, it clearly was not. His face resembled something more akin to a 60 year old man, a thick, gruff beard, and wrinkled skin. I watched as he raised his arms, jumping up and down at the counter like a toddler would, before one of the taller passengers behind him reached down and picked him up, sitting him on the counter top.

I had to blink a couple of times to make sure what I was seeing was actually happening. It didn’t matter how much I had been exposed to, the sheer absurdity of this ferry still managed to catch me off guard. I watched on as he placed his order, in a language I could not fathom, before sliding off the top of the counter and landing back on the floor with a thud. He caught sight of me staring as he spun back around to await his order, and as he did so, a frown emerged across his face. A second later, he took a step forward, raised his hand… and flipped me off.

Are you kidding me?! I thought to myself, as he turned back around and stared up at Café Guy, tapping his foot as if growing impatient. Café Guy noticed this, and he stepped away from the coffee machine for a moment. What happened next was rather chilling. I did not hear what was said between these two, but what I observed was enough. Café Guy slowly stepped out from behind the counter, kneeled down to get face to face with this little guy, and whispered in his ear. As he communicated whatever it was, the little guy’s face grew more and more sombre, as though realising he had made a terrible mistake. Just before he stood up, Café Guy pointed toward the Captain’s Quarters, before whispering a few more words of caution to the little fella. And that was it. Café Guy stood up once again. The little guy stood off to the side, his hands now tucked behind his back, waiting patiently and quietly for his order. Once his order was prepared, he grabbed it from Café Guy, turned around and looked at me sheepishly, gave a little wave as if to say “sorry about before”, and then waddled off downstairs.

I could only stare after him, left to wonder what Café Guy had told him. Although, it wasn’t hard to piece together the gist of it. Whatever that thing is that had stepped out from the Captain’s Quarters the other night is not something I’d like to be drawing the attention of. Pushing those thoughts to one side, and noticing that the remainder of the customers had received their orders and were now making their way back to their seats, I got up and made my way over, feeling hungry for a bite to eat, but also to pick this guy’s brain a little more.

*“Good morning my friend!”* Said Café Guy as I approached the counter. I gave him a little wave and returned his greeting, before stepping up to lean on the counter.

*“I guess there’s no point in asking you where we are? Or how we’re here?”* I asked Café Guy, assuming he was going to simply dance around the point once again. But then, what he said actually surprised me!

*“We’re on our final run! We’ll be home soon! You can relax now, the journey is almost over,”* he said, and something in his happy, optimistic tone had me almost believing those words. Deep in the back of my mind, I knew that wasn’t true, but hope is a strange thing, it just takes the tiniest spark to keep you believing, to keep you holding on.

*“Well, whatever that means, I guess I won’t be seeing you any more after, well, whatever comes next?”* I asked him, as he stood there smiling.

*“Oh I’ll be around young man. I’ve worked this route for many, many years, and I’ll be doing this for many more to come. Like I always say, important to know one’s place,”* he said, his smile wavering ever so slightly.

I stared back at him, a look on my face struggling to mask the millions of questions I still wanted to ask, yet knew to be pointless. I got the feeling that no matter what I said, how I phrased it, or how desperately I begged him for answers, he wasn’t going to give me any. Whether by choice, or perhaps he genuinely did not know, I’m still not sure. Anyway, satisfied that I had once again hit the threshold of what he was willing to offer, I turned my attention to my empty belly, asking him for a couple more of those sausage rolls that seemed a staple of his little cafeteria.

Café Guy smiled warmly, turning around and pulling a selection of sausage rolls out of the freezer box, and throwing them into the microwave. *“Coming right up Sir,”* he said, before turning around to prepare me a coffee. What a great bloke, I thought. I never even had to ask him. What’s more, he seemed to show the same kindness and accomodation to all the critters on this vessel, regardless of size, shape, language or outward appearance. Café Guy was a man of the people. Or, rather, of the nothing-people.

***Ding!***

Ah, my precious pastries were done. I grabbed them off Café Guy with a smile and a thank you, along with my hot coffee for the day, and bid him farewell once again, returning to my seat to get my breakfast into me. Sitting in my row of seats up front, I munched away on my sausage rolls and sipped my coffee as I gazed out the window, the universe slowly passing us by. Regardless of how I got here or what came next, I was very aware that I was witnessing something that very few human beings would ever have the privilege to see. I watched as a meteorite, its tail burning so very brightly in the darkness, flew past in the distance, and I wondered how far away it really was. One Earth-length? Five Earth-lengths? That blew my mind just thinking about it. Peeking my head out the window a little and looking up, I saw a group of tiny planets, or perhaps moons, just suspended there, as if props being held up by string before a huge, black canvas dotted with sparkles and swirls.

As the ferry drifted through this sheer magic, I swear I could hear whispers, all around me. Not inside the ferry, no, emanating and echoing all throughout the Galaxy, it seemed. They were indistinguishable from one another, yet beautifully unique at the same time. As insane as that sounds, all I can say is that things seemed to work differently out there. The laws of our world, they did not apply anymore. For example, my mind would occasionally catch a stray thought reminding me that there was no up or down out here, and I would suddenly feel weightless. I would have to lay down every time it happened, stretching out across my row of seats. Still when I think about it, I get that same feeling of vertigo. In that moment, however, before everything that happened next, I can honestly say it is the most alive I have ever felt. I continued watching the stars, distant planets and all manner of cosmic happenings for hours on end as the ferry continued gently floating along. Eventually, I do not know when, it could have been minutes, or it could have been hours, my eyes began to close, and I felt a sense of peace unlike any I have ever felt before, and likely ever will again. With an overwhelming feeling of warmth washing over my entire being, I was pulled into a blissful slumber once more…

***Bwooooooom! Bwooooooom!***

Jesus… I thought I was done hearing that God awful noise. I took a peak at my watch, noting the time was around 10pm at night. Gosh, I had slept for a good while. Sitting up from my little row of seats and stretching, I took another look out the window, noticing we had drifted our way into a very different looking sector of the Galaxy. I say Galaxy, as this is my best estimate. I had no idea if we were even still in the Milky Way, or if we had drifted far beyond the outer rim. What I saw outside at that point, in comparison to where we had just come from, the best word I can use is “desolate”. This part of space was quite empty, and the colours were very different. Where before I could see all manner of bright colours and shades, now there appeared to be a dull, blue haze encompassing the area, and it was sparsely populated with small, grey looking planets and moons. The ferry began to shake and vibrate, as we made a slow approach toward one of these planets.

I noticed how strange and different this felt. The ferry didn’t even turn or readjust itself in any way, it just started drifting diagonally, shaking more violently the closer it got, as if caught in some kind of gravitational pull. As we got closer to the planet, I watched as Ramp Guy stomped his way around the deck, grabbing the ramp and throwing it toward the gate in preparation. Slowly we were pulled nearer to this strange place, which now looked more like a small moon than a planet, its surface rocky and smooth. Before long, a loud clunk, and the ferry groaned as it positioned itself up against a very strange looking “jetty”. It looked to be crafted out of black obsidian, and it stretched out for kilometres on end. I noticed a few more odd figures making their way up the dock, preparing to board the ferry. Anything remotely humanoid was far gone by this point, these ones walked on all fours and moved in pairs. When they reached the top, Ramp Guy began shouting at them to hurry it along.

I averted my eyes as I heard them clomping their way up the stairs toward the upper floor, what passed for their hands and feet slopping along the floor before squirming their way into an empty row of seats a little way behind mine. The ferry was fast filling up now, with only four rows on my side still empty. We continued floating along, making stops at more of these galactic wastelands, picking up more of these beings along the way. At one of these stops, I kid you not, we docked in to collect a group of three tall figures that looked almost identical to the typical depiction of an alien that you see in movies and tv shows. Tall, slim, pale white and seemingly faceless. They gently swayed their way onto the ship, shuffling up the stairs and taking a seat directly behind me. I could see their forms, towering above me, out of the periphery of my vision. I could hear the strange noises they made as they sat there no doubt staring at me. Without another thought, I quickly stood up and practically ran out onto the deck.

I couldn’t handle it anymore! These things were too close to me now, and I could feel the burn of a thousand eyes on me. For some reason, I was still quite the spectacle on this ferry. That moment, was perhaps the most critical decision I made throughout my entire time on board. For as I made my way around to the front of the deck, I noticed something up ahead. It was only quite small in the distance at that stage, but I had my inklings as to what I was looking at. Something up ahead was much darker than the rest of the void surrounding us. I was staring at something pure pitched black in colour, and circular in shape. I knew what it was deep down, I knew in my heart, that’s where we were headed.

I ran back inside the ferry, bursting through the door, every set of eyes in the room drawn immediately to me, but I did not care. I ran to the Captain’s Quarters and I pounded on the door.

***“PLEASE!!!”*** I shouted, trying desperately to get his attention. I bashed on the door, over and over and over again, screaming at him to please listen to me.

***“PLEASE!!! LET ME OFF THIS FERRY!!!”*** I shouted, slamming my fist against the glass so hard I thought it might break. This time, I did get the Captain’s attention. Slowly, ever so slowly, he turned around to face me, without ever taking his hands off the wheel. He stared at me for moments on end, his face a blank slate, totally emotionless. I saw in that moment that it was pointless. The way this man looked at me, a look of complete and utter indifference toward me, as though I was merely cattle being herded toward the slaughter, was absolutely soul crushing.

I gently tapped my fist against the glass once more, my head now resting down beside my hand against the glass, and I sobbed. I sobbed because I knew it was over. I sobbed as I faced the prospect of half a life cut meaninglessly short. I sobbed as I looked up again, noticing the black spot on the horizon ahead growing larger still. I sobbed as I turned around, my back resting against the door as I slid down to the floor. And I sobbed harder still, as I looked up to see Café Guy standing there, his eyes wet with tears the same as mine. Forcing myself up, I approached his counter for what I was sure would be the last time.

*“Why?”* Was all I could ask. Café Guy just shook his head in response, wiping some tears away as he did so.

*“It shouldn’t be possible,”* he said between sobs. *“I knew there was something different about you the day I first saw you. Your eyes too vibrant, your spirit, too lively. You were not ready for this journey.”*

I stared back at him, things beginning to slowly fall into place. Tears welled up in my eyes as I spoke again, gently now, any remnants of hope long gone. 

*“I… I still don’t understand.”* I said. *“If it’s not possible, then how can it be? Why me?”* I asked, tears pouring from my eyes.

Café Guy looked at me solemnly, a deep and genuine sadness present on his once kind face. Wiping away his own tears again, he spoke softly to me.

“*There are very few hard and fast rules at play in this universe. Certainly, fewer than we would like to believe. Sure, we have built ourselves a comfortable little modern society, under the false pretence that we are ever truly in control of any of it, overly confident in the knowledge that nothing which exists outside of our realms of understanding can ever harm us. It shouldn’t have been possible, young man. But you boarded the wrong ferry at the wrong time… Now, there’s nothing any of us can do about it but continue on to our final destination…”*

I stood there in shock, not wanting to believe the words I was hearing, yet knowing full well within my heart that it was true. Café Guy placed a gentle hand on my shoulder.

*“I’m so… so sorry sir…”*

Defeated, I once again walked out on deck. I just paced around out there, not knowing what I could even do next, resigning myself to just making the most of the moments I had left. Around and around I strolled, looking out into the vacuum which enveloped us. Occasionally, I would look out ahead at the ever expanding size of the monster we were approaching. I had heard talk of black holes in my life, but I never really understood the many theories surrounding them. I wondered what we might face on the other side. Would we freeze, or perhaps burn to death? A little of both? Would we be transported to some incredible afterlife? Or perhaps the opposite? Or would it all turn black as midnight, our shared existence blinking out in an instant?

Hang on a second, I thought… *“midnight”*…

*“You boarded the wrong ferry at the wrong time…”*

What ran through my mind in that instant was perhaps extreme, yet is not hope so often a mere grain, worth taking a leap of faith for? My heart began to race, those primal instincts telling me to turn and run, or stand and fight, kicking in once again. I glanced at my watch… 

*11:45pm.*

It would need to be timed perfectly, I thought, as I ran back inside and took a seat in my now one empty row, ever other seat on the vessel now occupied by nothing-people and shadowy, alien lifeforms. I sat on the edge of my seat, my leg bouncing nervously up and down, as I glanced back and forth between the stairwell and my watch. As I sat there, waiting for my one moment of hope to approach, I heard the crackle of the P.A. system spark back to life.

*“Attention passengers. The final café service is now open. Last meal requests shall now be taken. Please form an orderly line and requests shall be catered to to the best of our ability.”*

Hearing those words… “last meal”… was harrowing. But I steeled myself, intent to remain focussed at all costs, no matter what else might happen around me. I glanced back at my watch. The minutes were ticking by so very slowly now. I only prayed this thing was still in sync, or that time was even relevant out here. I did not know… What I did know is that it was a chance. And that was the best I could hope for.

The herd of nothing-people were all making their way up to the counter, what seemed like hundreds of them now, blocking the stairwell. I watched in amazement as Café Guy churned out beautiful meals, seemingly from nowhere. Everything from fine Italian cuisine, to hearty noodle dishes, as well as odd looking slops, grains and other dishes that were not even remotely comprehensible to my human mind. Before long the line had moved up and around the aisles enough that I had some space to slip down the stairs. Before I did so I quickly made my way over to the side of the counter, placing a hand on Café Guy’s shoulder. He looked over to me, puzzled.

*“Thank you. For everything.”* I said to him, before darting off down the stairs. There was a look in his eyes as I left him there. He looked concerned, like he knew what I had planned, and was just as unsure as me as to whether or not it might work.

Stepping down out of the stairwell, I grabbed myself a seat right on the edge of one of the centre rows, with a straight shot to the Portside exit. I sat there, nervously bouncing my leg up and down again, my adrenaline starting to kick in. I glanced at my watch…

*11:57pm.* 

This is it, I thought, as I glanced back up to look at the doorway… and I froze. Ramp Guy, with his massive form and his hate filled glare, was standing right there, staring at me. Oh my God. Did he know? I stood up from my seat, pacing back and forth up and down the aisles, pretending to be simply stretching my legs. Every time I turned around to pace back down the aisle, I saw him, still standing there blocking the doorway. I looked back at my watch… 

*11:58pm.*

I spun around, walking back up the stairwell now. I could practically feel the ticking of my watch, every precious second not one that I could afford to waste. Reaching the top step I turned the corner, heading toward the Portside deck on the upper floor. On my way past, I caught sight once more of Café Guy. I think he knew now, and he gave me a warm smile and a nod as I passed him by. I slid open the doorway, stepping out onto the upper deck, and leaning over the railing. Ramp Guy was still there, standing in the doorway downstairs.

*11:59pm…*

It was now or never. I stepped up onto the railing of the upper deck, and I jumped!

***CLANG!***

I landed gut first on the lower deck, completely disoriented with the ferry’s weird movements through space. This did not go unnoticed by Ramp Guy, nor did my almost perfectly executed series of movements following it, as I threw myself back onto my feet and ripped open the ferry’s Portside gates. I stood there, teetering on the edge, staring down into the void, as Ramp Guy began moving toward me.

*30 seconds to go…*

I gripped onto the railing so hard it hurt my hands, as I shuffled my feet along the narrow, slippery ledge on the outside of the vessel. Clinging to the ferry, I took a few measured steps along the outside, trying to make it as difficult as possible for this prick to grab me.

*15 seconds to go…*

*10 seconds to go…*

I counted them down in my head now, as I desperately tried to cling on to the railing until the last possible second.

*10… 9… 8…*

Ramp Guy was right there in front of me now!

*7… 6… 5…*

*“Where do ya think you’re goin’ aye?!”* He grunted, as he gripped my arms tight.

*4… 3… 2… 1…*

I pushed off as hard as I could, launching myself willingly into the abyss! Ramp Guy, however, did not let go. So determined to keep me on board that hellish vessel he was, that he was now plummeting through space right along with me! As we fell, the cold solar winds whipping by us as we went, I cried out in pain as he wrapped a massive arm around my neck, seemingly intent on at least killing me if he could not keep me prisoner.

Down and down we fell, Ramp Guy squeezing the life out of me harder and harder all the while. I could feel myself slipping away into darkness, and for a few awful moments I was all but certain that after everything this was going to be how it ended for me, when suddenly, a familiar crash of thunder!

***SPLASH!***

I was under water again. Where? I did not know. I tried desperately to kick my legs and get myself back to the surface, but I could not move. I opened up my eyes, and in one horrifying moment I saw why. A long dead, rotting corpse was clung to my body. I screamed, bubbles escaping my mouth as I manically tried to get this thing off me! Finally, after much thrashing and kicking, I was free, and I kicked my legs and flailed my arms as hard as I could, making my way up toward the sliver of moonlight I could see above.

With a crash, I broke through the surface, desperately taking in air as I looked around, trying to figure out where the hell I had ended up this time. And then I saw it. It took a few moments to take it all in, admittedly. The familiar cityscape beyond the harbour lights. The iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House, still standing firm and in tact. Luna Park… bright and bubbly just as it had always been. I was back in Sydney. The real Sydney!

*“Oi! Get outa' the water dickhead! There’s sharks in there!”*

As if to confirm what I was seeing in possibly the most Aussie way possible, a shout from the shoreline, from a real human being! I never thought in a million years I would be so glad to be bobbing up and down in the middle of Sydney Harbour at midnight.

The man did raise a good point though, and I began quickly making a bee line for the rocky edges of the harbour nearby. One stroke… then another… then another. All the while, very concious that a bull shark may see fit to take a chunk out of me as I swam along. But I kept going, knowing that freedom was just metres away now.

The feeling of grabbing onto those rocks, and dragging myself up onto the grass, is the best sensation I have ever experienced in my life. I remember the blades of grass digging into my skin as I stared up at the starry, moonlit sky with a newfound sense of dread, and I recall how overwhelmingly grateful I was for merely being able to feel something as mundane as grass. I was back… I was home…

I did not even consider getting on another ferry. Or a bus, or a train. Too paranoid that something may spirit me away to another realm. I walked myself up the hill, found the nearest road, and called myself an Uber like I dam well should have done in the first place. A little over an hour later, and finally, I was stepping in through my front door for the first time in what had genuinely felt like months, but in reality, had been merely a few days.

There has been much I have reflected on in the days since I returned. Not least of all Café Guy’s words. There are indeed, very few rules keeping this existence of our’s bound to normality. Fewer than any of us would be comfortable being truly aware of. I am no stranger to this corner of the internet. That which houses endless Creepypasta tales and reality bending horror stories. So the next time you’re reading one of these submissions, perhaps something about a cursed bus, or a haunted tram ride. Consider for a moment, how farfetched are these stories really? It has been long theorised among those familiar with the paranormal that there are certain times of day which align with things we simply do not understand. And there are of course, places in this world where strange things are simply more prone to occur.

Maybe you’ll remember my tale the next time you’re waiting in line for the bus or the train… or the ferry. Perhaps the stop you’re waiting at feels a little off. A little too liminal, almost like a place between places. Maybe you notice something that doesn’t quite fit, like an out of place fog. Maybe in those moments, it’s best to just call yourself a cab. I don’t know. All I know is that what I experienced on board was definitely not of this world. It terrifies me to think what might have happened if I had remained on board, if I had not chanced that leap of faith at the exact moment I did.

Who knows where I’d be. And who knows how many more of these vessels are still out there.",1,1738220724.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1idh6z8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1idh6z8/i_am_unjustifiably_and_ridiculously_exhausted_all/,I am unjustifiably and ridiculously exhausted all the time,"Essentially as title states except I will say the extreme exhaustion fluctuates and seems to come in waves for weeks at a time. 


I am a relatively healthy 31 year old male with no real other on going health concerns besides some very mild asthma flare ups and hayfever. I am a regular gym goer who has mostly focused on weight training but am transitioning to a more cardio focused routine now - I currently only workout a few days a week but get some activity most days when I walk my dogs. 


I eat decently well with usually 3 meals a day, with some form of meat and vege for dinner, usually leftovers for lunch and oats for breakfast. I sometime take caffeine for a boost but limit it to  say 2 coffees a day max and have long ago ditched any of the pre-workout supplements. While I do stay up late to game most nights (12am), it is consistent and I still get my 8 hours of sleep as my alarm doesn't go off until 8am in the morning. I keep this pretty consistent 7 days a week so there's no fluctuation in the hours of sleep I get. 


I am very fortunate to have what majority would call an easy life. I make decent money in a job where I spend my days driving around in an air conditioned car, driving store to store to meet with inventory managers to discuss our product ranges. I would honestly say I barely work 5 or 6 hours a day and at least 1/3 of that is just spent driving. Most of the conversations end up just being small talk and chatting about the local sports game or some other mutual interest - again very easy going and nothing I'm stressing about every day and nothing that causes me to bring stress home with me. 


Now with all the above said, I am still exhausted to the point I cannot stay awake for a full day when these bouts come. I am falling asleep on the couch 7 hours before my regular bed time. I am sometimes struggling to stay awake driving if I've had a day of work that's consisted of more than 5 hours of actual work. I get irritable and moody and often even a little emotional seemingly out of nowhere. 


While I am Usually healthy, in recent years I have tended to get some major illness once a year that usually winds up with me in hospital. In the last 6 or so years I've had Covid, Glandular Fever, Meningitus (Viral), Meckles Diverticulum (surgery to remove) and more recently had a car accident (2 years ago) that while low impact and minor, lead to my approximate 10th+ concussion in 8 years, with a long recovery process and eyesight issues for 6 months. I then approx 9 months ago had issues with major dizzy spells that got chalked up to vertigo, but some of the doctors thought it could likely be linked to the latest concussion. As I also tend to get sick yearly I either have a forced or I go voluntarily for a general checkup with my doctor. I get bloods done and except for when diagnosed with something, my bloods are always completely in the normal range. 


So in essence I'm just lost. I feel like fairly young, fairly fit, in day to day decent health, eat fairly well, get at least 20 minutes of exercise in a day, sleep for at least 7-8 hours a night and live a low stress life with a low stress job. I genuinely do not understand why I feel like this so often when my bloodwork also shows nothing. 


For further context, in the last 7 years I have worked both as a qualified school teacher which was FAR more stressful and mentally taxing as well as working in the factory for my current company doing manual Labour for often 50-65 hour weeks and in neither of those jobs was I anywhere near as exhausted as I am now doing a cushy job for  barely 25 hours a week

Standing out on that deck as the ferry drifted through an infinite expanse of stars, was by far the most out of body I have ever felt. I could not comprehend how this was happening. I shouldn’t have even been alive out there, yet somehow I was able to breathe and move just as I normally would. Whether by some magical confines of the ever mysterious vessel, or some universal spell I was under, I still don’t know. I slowly paced around the deck, taking in the awe inspiring views all around me. Making my way around to the upper front deck, I looked out to the Portside of the ferry and had to steady myself, as I saw a massive glowing white ball which appeared to be so close to us I could have jumped off and floated right to it.

It took me a few moments to realise it. I was staring at our Moon. I was dumbstruck, it was so close! Right there! I turned back around, gazing out over the Starboard side, and I noticed that Earth was directly in my line of sight now. I turned back around, there was the moon to my left. Looking back again, there’s Earth off to my right. Something happened to me in that moment. This was entirely wrong. My mind, it simply could not compute the orientation. The moon should be above me. Earth should be below my feet. It also dawned on me in that moment, I was seeing Earth to my right, where it was below me earlier. We must have been slowly spinning around as we drifted through the Galaxy. Again, I couldn’t mentally process this. I began to feel incredibly dizzy, and I fell to the ground, unable to pick myself back up. I had to crawl my way back inside, sliding open the door and dragging myself to one of the only remaining empty rows of seats that were not yet occupied by the nothing-people.

Sitting back in my seat now, I just looked out the window, watching the celestial light show outside. If I wasn’t already, I was pretty dam sure now that I was not getting off this boat… ever. I felt a sense of peace in that moment, like I didn’t have try so hard anymore. There was a feeling of acceptance, followed by a mix of sadness and regret. I thought back to that night. What if I had just taken a cab instead? It was midnight, what on earth was I even thinking taking a ferry back home at that hour anyway? Money, of course. It was always about money. Not in this moment it wasn’t. All of that seemed quite unimportant now. I just… watched. As literal space and time passed by before my very eyes. Before long, my eyes became heavy, and I could keep them open no longer…

*“Attention passengers! The café service is now open! Please form a line, do not rush, do not push. Everybody will be served in due time.”*

The announcement from the P.A. system ripped me out of my slumber, signalling the return of my one and only friendly companion. I watched as the masses of nothing-people and strange humanoids began their march toward the café. The ferry was almost full now, and there was a constant stream of them shuffling and stuttering their way up the stairs and towards the counter. One by one they placed their orders, collecting cups of coffee, hot pies, fresh sandwiches and slices of cake, before slowly making their way back down and filling up the empty seats once again.

I decided to wait until things calmed down a bit. I didn’t want to go anywhere near these things. The tall, pointy limbed ones which had boarded the ferry in the mangrove swamp yesterday were now clicking their way up the stairs, and I cringed back a little as they emerged at the top, their faces coming into view for the first time. They were downright horrible. Long, puffy faces that seemed permanently crafted into vicious looks of sheer hatred. I looked away, resigning myself to just waiting until I heard the crowds disperse. I could hear Café Guy struggling to keep up with all this, yet his overtly positive attitude never once faltered. He still hummed Kumbaya as he went about his duties, and I now smiled at the sound of that tune, where it once kinda weirded me out. If he could keep his spirits up, maybe I could too.

I sat back, waiting my turn. Slowly but surely, in amongst noises I cannot even accurately put into words, I heard the crowd beginning to thin, and I chanced a look back in the direction of the café. There were only about five or six passengers now, waiting in line to be served. At the front of the line stood a short little thing, no taller than a child of maybe five years old. His form was scrawny, save for his gigantic head, and I wondered how he actually stayed upright. It looked as though he should be toppling over every step. While this thing resembled a child in stature, it clearly was not. His face resembled something more akin to a 60 year old man, a thick, gruff beard, and wrinkled skin. I watched as he raised his arms, jumping up and down at the counter like a toddler would, before one of the taller passengers behind him reached down and picked him up, sitting him on the counter top.

I had to blink a couple of times to make sure what I was seeing was actually happening. It didn’t matter how much I had been exposed to, the sheer absurdity of this ferry still managed to catch me off guard. I watched on as he placed his order, in a language I could not fathom, before sliding off the top of the counter and landing back on the floor with a thud. He caught sight of me staring as he spun back around to await his order, and as he did so, a frown emerged across his face. A second later, he took a step forward, raised his hand… and flipped me off.

Are you kidding me?! I thought to myself, as he turned back around and stared up at Café Guy, tapping his foot as if growing impatient. Café Guy noticed this, and he stepped away from the coffee machine for a moment. What happened next was rather chilling. I did not hear what was said between these two, but what I observed was enough. Café Guy slowly stepped out from behind the counter, kneeled down to get face to face with this little guy, and whispered in his ear. As he communicated whatever it was, the little guy’s face grew more and more sombre, as though realising he had made a terrible mistake. Just before he stood up, Café Guy pointed toward the Captain’s Quarters, before whispering a few more words of caution to the little fella. And that was it. Café Guy stood up once again. The little guy stood off to the side, his hands now tucked behind his back, waiting patiently and quietly for his order. Once his order was prepared, he grabbed it from Café Guy, turned around and looked at me sheepishly, gave a little wave as if to say “sorry about before”, and then waddled off downstairs.

I could only stare after him, left to wonder what Café Guy had told him. Although, it wasn’t hard to piece together the gist of it. Whatever that thing is that had stepped out from the Captain’s Quarters the other night is not something I’d like to be drawing the attention of. Pushing those thoughts to one side, and noticing that the remainder of the customers had received their orders and were now making their way back to their seats, I got up and made my way over, feeling hungry for a bite to eat, but also to pick this guy’s brain a little more.

*“Good morning my friend!”* Said Café Guy as I approached the counter. I gave him a little wave and returned his greeting, before stepping up to lean on the counter.

*“I guess there’s no point in asking you where we are? Or how we’re here?”* I asked Café Guy, assuming he was going to simply dance around the point once again. But then, what he said actually surprised me!

*“We’re on our final run! We’ll be home soon! You can relax now, the journey is almost over,”* he said, and something in his happy, optimistic tone had me almost believing those words. Deep in the back of my mind, I knew that wasn’t true, but hope is a strange thing, it just takes the tiniest spark to keep you believing, to keep you holding on.

*“Well, whatever that means, I guess I won’t be seeing you any more after, well, whatever comes next?”* I asked him, as he stood there smiling.

*“Oh I’ll be around young man. I’ve worked this route for many, many years, and I’ll be doing this for many more to come. Like I always say, important to know one’s place,”* he said, his smile wavering ever so slightly.

I stared back at him, a look on my face struggling to mask the millions of questions I still wanted to ask, yet knew to be pointless. I got the feeling that no matter what I said, how I phrased it, or how desperately I begged him for answers, he wasn’t going to give me any. Whether by choice, or perhaps he genuinely did not know, I’m still not sure. Anyway, satisfied that I had once again hit the threshold of what he was willing to offer, I turned my attention to my empty belly, asking him for a couple more of those sausage rolls that seemed a staple of his little cafeteria.

Café Guy smiled warmly, turning around and pulling a selection of sausage rolls out of the freezer box, and throwing them into the microwave. *“Coming right up Sir,”* he said, before turning around to prepare me a coffee. What a great bloke, I thought. I never even had to ask him. What’s more, he seemed to show the same kindness and accomodation to all the critters on this vessel, regardless of size, shape, language or outward appearance. Café Guy was a man of the people. Or, rather, of the nothing-people.

***Ding!***

Ah, my precious pastries were done. I grabbed them off Café Guy with a smile and a thank you, along with my hot coffee for the day, and bid him farewell once again, returning to my seat to get my breakfast into me. Sitting in my row of seats up front, I munched away on my sausage rolls and sipped my coffee as I gazed out the window, the universe slowly passing us by. Regardless of how I got here or what came next, I was very aware that I was witnessing something that very few human beings would ever have the privilege to see. I watched as a meteorite, its tail burning so very brightly in the darkness, flew past in the distance, and I wondered how far away it really was. One Earth-length? Five Earth-lengths? That blew my mind just thinking about it. Peeking my head out the window a little and looking up, I saw a group of tiny planets, or perhaps moons, just suspended there, as if props being held up by string before a huge, black canvas dotted with sparkles and swirls.

As the ferry drifted through this sheer magic, I swear I could hear whispers, all around me. Not inside the ferry, no, emanating and echoing all throughout the Galaxy, it seemed. They were indistinguishable from one another, yet beautifully unique at the same time. As insane as that sounds, all I can say is that things seemed to work differently out there. The laws of our world, they did not apply anymore. For example, my mind would occasionally catch a stray thought reminding me that there was no up or down out here, and I would suddenly feel weightless. I would have to lay down every time it happened, stretching out across my row of seats. Still when I think about it, I get that same feeling of vertigo. In that moment, however, before everything that happened next, I can honestly say it is the most alive I have ever felt. I continued watching the stars, distant planets and all manner of cosmic happenings for hours on end as the ferry continued gently floating along. Eventually, I do not know when, it could have been minutes, or it could have been hours, my eyes began to close, and I felt a sense of peace unlike any I have ever felt before, and likely ever will again. With an overwhelming feeling of warmth washing over my entire being, I was pulled into a blissful slumber once more…

***Bwooooooom! Bwooooooom!***

Jesus… I thought I was done hearing that God awful noise. I took a peak at my watch, noting the time was around 10pm at night. Gosh, I had slept for a good while. Sitting up from my little row of seats and stretching, I took another look out the window, noticing we had drifted our way into a very different looking sector of the Galaxy. I say Galaxy, as this is my best estimate. I had no idea if we were even still in the Milky Way, or if we had drifted far beyond the outer rim. What I saw outside at that point, in comparison to where we had just come from, the best word I can use is “desolate”. This part of space was quite empty, and the colours were very different. Where before I could see all manner of bright colours and shades, now there appeared to be a dull, blue haze encompassing the area, and it was sparsely populated with small, grey looking planets and moons. The ferry began to shake and vibrate, as we made a slow approach toward one of these planets.

I noticed how strange and different this felt. The ferry didn’t even turn or readjust itself in any way, it just started drifting diagonally, shaking more violently the closer it got, as if caught in some kind of gravitational pull. As we got closer to the planet, I watched as Ramp Guy stomped his way around the deck, grabbing the ramp and throwing it toward the gate in preparation. Slowly we were pulled nearer to this strange place, which now looked more like a small moon than a planet, its surface rocky and smooth. Before long, a loud clunk, and the ferry groaned as it positioned itself up against a very strange looking “jetty”. It looked to be crafted out of black obsidian, and it stretched out for kilometres on end. I noticed a few more odd figures making their way up the dock, preparing to board the ferry. Anything remotely humanoid was far gone by this point, these ones walked on all fours and moved in pairs. When they reached the top, Ramp Guy began shouting at them to hurry it along.

I averted my eyes as I heard them clomping their way up the stairs toward the upper floor, what passed for their hands and feet slopping along the floor before squirming their way into an empty row of seats a little way behind mine. The ferry was fast filling up now, with only four rows on my side still empty. We continued floating along, making stops at more of these galactic wastelands, picking up more of these beings along the way. At one of these stops, I kid you not, we docked in to collect a group of three tall figures that looked almost identical to the typical depiction of an alien that you see in movies and tv shows. Tall, slim, pale white and seemingly faceless. They gently swayed their way onto the ship, shuffling up the stairs and taking a seat directly behind me. I could see their forms, towering above me, out of the periphery of my vision. I could hear the strange noises they made as they sat there no doubt staring at me. Without another thought, I quickly stood up and practically ran out onto the deck.

I couldn’t handle it anymore! These things were too close to me now, and I could feel the burn of a thousand eyes on me. For some reason, I was still quite the spectacle on this ferry. That moment, was perhaps the most critical decision I made throughout my entire time on board. For as I made my way around to the front of the deck, I noticed something up ahead. It was only quite small in the distance at that stage, but I had my inklings as to what I was looking at. Something up ahead was much darker than the rest of the void surrounding us. I was staring at something pure pitched black in colour, and circular in shape. I knew what it was deep down, I knew in my heart, that’s where we were headed.

I ran back inside the ferry, bursting through the door, every set of eyes in the room drawn immediately to me, but I did not care. I ran to the Captain’s Quarters and I pounded on the door.

***“PLEASE!!!”*** I shouted, trying desperately to get his attention. I bashed on the door, over and over and over again, screaming at him to please listen to me.

***“PLEASE!!! LET ME OFF THIS FERRY!!!”*** I shouted, slamming my fist against the glass so hard I thought it might break. This time, I did get the Captain’s attention. Slowly, ever so slowly, he turned around to face me, without ever taking his hands off the wheel. He stared at me for moments on end, his face a blank slate, totally emotionless. I saw in that moment that it was pointless. The way this man looked at me, a look of complete and utter indifference toward me, as though I was merely cattle being herded toward the slaughter, was absolutely soul crushing.

I gently tapped my fist against the glass once more, my head now resting down beside my hand against the glass, and I sobbed. I sobbed because I knew it was over. I sobbed as I faced the prospect of half a life cut meaninglessly short. I sobbed as I looked up again, noticing the black spot on the horizon ahead growing larger still. I sobbed as I turned around, my back resting against the door as I slid down to the floor. And I sobbed harder still, as I looked up to see Café Guy standing there, his eyes wet with tears the same as mine. Forcing myself up, I approached his counter for what I was sure would be the last time.

*“Why?”* Was all I could ask. Café Guy just shook his head in response, wiping some tears away as he did so.

*“It shouldn’t be possible,”* he said between sobs. *“I knew there was something different about you the day I first saw you. Your eyes too vibrant, your spirit, too lively. You were not ready for this journey.”*

I stared back at him, things beginning to slowly fall into place. Tears welled up in my eyes as I spoke again, gently now, any remnants of hope long gone. 

*“I… I still don’t understand.”* I said. *“If it’s not possible, then how can it be? Why me?”* I asked, tears pouring from my eyes.

Café Guy looked at me solemnly, a deep and genuine sadness present on his once kind face. Wiping away his own tears again, he spoke softly to me.

“*There are very few hard and fast rules at play in this universe. Certainly, fewer than we would like to believe. Sure, we have built ourselves a comfortable little modern society, under the false pretence that we are ever truly in control of any of it, overly confident in the knowledge that nothing which exists outside of our realms of understanding can ever harm us. It shouldn’t have been possible, young man. But you boarded the wrong ferry at the wrong time… Now, there’s nothing any of us can do about it but continue on to our final destination…”*

I stood there in shock, not wanting to believe the words I was hearing, yet knowing full well within my heart that it was true. Café Guy placed a gentle hand on my shoulder.

*“I’m so… so sorry sir…”*

Defeated, I once again walked out on deck. I just paced around out there, not knowing what I could even do next, resigning myself to just making the most of the moments I had left. Around and around I strolled, looking out into the vacuum which enveloped us. Occasionally, I would look out ahead at the ever expanding size of the monster we were approaching. I had heard talk of black holes in my life, but I never really understood the many theories surrounding them. I wondered what we might face on the other side. Would we freeze, or perhaps burn to death? A little of both? Would we be transported to some incredible afterlife? Or perhaps the opposite? Or would it all turn black as midnight, our shared existence blinking out in an instant?

Hang on a second, I thought… *“midnight”*…

*“You boarded the wrong ferry at the wrong time…”*

What ran through my mind in that instant was perhaps extreme, yet is not hope so often a mere grain, worth taking a leap of faith for? My heart began to race, those primal instincts telling me to turn and run, or stand and fight, kicking in once again. I glanced at my watch… 

*11:45pm.*

It would need to be timed perfectly, I thought, as I ran back inside and took a seat in my now one empty row, ever other seat on the vessel now occupied by nothing-people and shadowy, alien lifeforms. I sat on the edge of my seat, my leg bouncing nervously up and down, as I glanced back and forth between the stairwell and my watch. As I sat there, waiting for my one moment of hope to approach, I heard the crackle of the P.A. system spark back to life.

*“Attention passengers. The final café service is now open. Last meal requests shall now be taken. Please form an orderly line and requests shall be catered to to the best of our ability.”*

Hearing those words… “last meal”… was harrowing. But I steeled myself, intent to remain focussed at all costs, no matter what else might happen around me. I glanced back at my watch. The minutes were ticking by so very slowly now. I only prayed this thing was still in sync, or that time was even relevant out here. I did not know… What I did know is that it was a chance. And that was the best I could hope for.

The herd of nothing-people were all making their way up to the counter, what seemed like hundreds of them now, blocking the stairwell. I watched in amazement as Café Guy churned out beautiful meals, seemingly from nowhere. Everything from fine Italian cuisine, to hearty noodle dishes, as well as odd looking slops, grains and other dishes that were not even remotely comprehensible to my human mind. Before long the line had moved up and around the aisles enough that I had some space to slip down the stairs. Before I did so I quickly made my way over to the side of the counter, placing a hand on Café Guy’s shoulder. He looked over to me, puzzled.

*“Thank you. For everything.”* I said to him, before darting off down the stairs. There was a look in his eyes as I left him there. He looked concerned, like he knew what I had planned, and was just as unsure as me as to whether or not it might work.

Stepping down out of the stairwell, I grabbed myself a seat right on the edge of one of the centre rows, with a straight shot to the Portside exit. I sat there, nervously bouncing my leg up and down again, my adrenaline starting to kick in. I glanced at my watch…

*11:57pm.* 

This is it, I thought, as I glanced back up to look at the doorway… and I froze. Ramp Guy, with his massive form and his hate filled glare, was standing right there, staring at me. Oh my God. Did he know? I stood up from my seat, pacing back and forth up and down the aisles, pretending to be simply stretching my legs. Every time I turned around to pace back down the aisle, I saw him, still standing there blocking the doorway. I looked back at my watch… 

*11:58pm.*

I spun around, walking back up the stairwell now. I could practically feel the ticking of my watch, every precious second not one that I could afford to waste. Reaching the top step I turned the corner, heading toward the Portside deck on the upper floor. On my way past, I caught sight once more of Café Guy. I think he knew now, and he gave me a warm smile and a nod as I passed him by. I slid open the doorway, stepping out onto the upper deck, and leaning over the railing. Ramp Guy was still there, standing in the doorway downstairs.

*11:59pm…*

It was now or never. I stepped up onto the railing of the upper deck, and I jumped!

***CLANG!***

I landed gut first on the lower deck, completely disoriented with the ferry’s weird movements through space. This did not go unnoticed by Ramp Guy, nor did my almost perfectly executed series of movements following it, as I threw myself back onto my feet and ripped open the ferry’s Portside gates. I stood there, teetering on the edge, staring down into the void, as Ramp Guy began moving toward me.

*30 seconds to go…*

I gripped onto the railing so hard it hurt my hands, as I shuffled my feet along the narrow, slippery ledge on the outside of the vessel. Clinging to the ferry, I took a few measured steps along the outside, trying to make it as difficult as possible for this prick to grab me.

*15 seconds to go…*

*10 seconds to go…*

I counted them down in my head now, as I desperately tried to cling on to the railing until the last possible second.

*10… 9… 8…*

Ramp Guy was right there in front of me now!

*7… 6… 5…*

*“Where do ya think you’re goin’ aye?!”* He grunted, as he gripped my arms tight.

*4… 3… 2… 1…*

I pushed off as hard as I could, launching myself willingly into the abyss! Ramp Guy, however, did not let go. So determined to keep me on board that hellish vessel he was, that he was now plummeting through space right along with me! As we fell, the cold solar winds whipping by us as we went, I cried out in pain as he wrapped a massive arm around my neck, seemingly intent on at least killing me if he could not keep me prisoner.

Down and down we fell, Ramp Guy squeezing the life out of me harder and harder all the while. I could feel myself slipping away into darkness, and for a few awful moments I was all but certain that after everything this was going to be how it ended for me, when suddenly, a familiar crash of thunder!

***SPLASH!***

I was under water again. Where? I did not know. I tried desperately to kick my legs and get myself back to the surface, but I could not move. I opened up my eyes, and in one horrifying moment I saw why. A long dead, rotting corpse was clung to my body. I screamed, bubbles escaping my mouth as I manically tried to get this thing off me! Finally, after much thrashing and kicking, I was free, and I kicked my legs and flailed my arms as hard as I could, making my way up toward the sliver of moonlight I could see above.

With a crash, I broke through the surface, desperately taking in air as I looked around, trying to figure out where the hell I had ended up this time. And then I saw it. It took a few moments to take it all in, admittedly. The familiar cityscape beyond the harbour lights. The iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House, still standing firm and in tact. Luna Park… bright and bubbly just as it had always been. I was back in Sydney. The real Sydney!

*“Oi! Get outa' the water dickhead! There’s sharks in there!”*

As if to confirm what I was seeing in possibly the most Aussie way possible, a shout from the shoreline, from a real human being! I never thought in a million years I would be so glad to be bobbing up and down in the middle of Sydney Harbour at midnight.

The man did raise a good point though, and I began quickly making a bee line for the rocky edges of the harbour nearby. One stroke… then another… then another. All the while, very concious that a bull shark may see fit to take a chunk out of me as I swam along. But I kept going, knowing that freedom was just metres away now.

The feeling of grabbing onto those rocks, and dragging myself up onto the grass, is the best sensation I have ever experienced in my life. I remember the blades of grass digging into my skin as I stared up at the starry, moonlit sky with a newfound sense of dread, and I recall how overwhelmingly grateful I was for merely being able to feel something as mundane as grass. I was back… I was home…

I did not even consider getting on another ferry. Or a bus, or a train. Too paranoid that something may spirit me away to another realm. I walked myself up the hill, found the nearest road, and called myself an Uber like I dam well should have done in the first place. A little over an hour later, and finally, I was stepping in through my front door for the first time in what had genuinely felt like months, but in reality, had been merely a few days.

There has been much I have reflected on in the days since I returned. Not least of all Café Guy’s words. There are indeed, very few rules keeping this existence of our’s bound to normality. Fewer than any of us would be comfortable being truly aware of. I am no stranger to this corner of the internet. That which houses endless Creepypasta tales and reality bending horror stories. So the next time you’re reading one of these submissions, perhaps something about a cursed bus, or a haunted tram ride. Consider for a moment, how farfetched are these stories really? It has been long theorised among those familiar with the paranormal that there are certain times of day which align with things we simply do not understand. And there are of course, places in this world where strange things are simply more prone to occur.

Maybe you’ll remember my tale the next time you’re waiting in line for the bus or the train… or the ferry. Perhaps the stop you’re waiting at feels a little off. A little too liminal, almost like a place between places. Maybe you notice something that doesn’t quite fit, like an out of place fog. Maybe in those moments, it’s best to just call yourself a cab. I don’t know. All I know is that what I experienced on board was definitely not of this world. It terrifies me to think what might have happened if I had remained on board, if I had not chanced that leap of faith at the exact moment I did.

1idh2be,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1idh2be/girl_coming_on_strong_but_doesnt_want_to_meet/,Girl coming on strong but doesn’t want to meet?,"Hey all. I’ve been talking to this girl (mid-20s) from Hinge for about a couple weeks now. We started texting a lot right off the bat and had multiple long (2+ hour) phone calls. She’s very flirty, talks about her family, the kind of relationships she has had and wants. She also got pretty sexual really early on (like within the first couple days) which caught me a little off guard given how early it was. She also talks a lot about wanting a relationship—romantic gestures, date ideas, all that. On paper, she seems super into me.

The problem though is she doesn’t really want to meet up, I don’t think. 

I’ve suggested very low-pressure, public meetups—grabbing coffee, saying hi at a bookstore while I’m already in her city, something quick and casual to break the ice. Every time, she dodges or says she doesn’t think she’ll be able to, but she never suggests an alternative or asks when I’ll be around again.
Last night, we were on the phone for 2.5 hours. She talked about future date ideas, romantic stuff she wants, got sexual again—all that. I brought up that I’d be in her city the next day and could meet for literally a few minutes, and she said she probably couldn’t because of meetings.
Now, I made it clear that I was going to be in town for a while. I told her I’d be seeing friends and running errands, so time wasn’t really a factor for me. I even told her to just text me after her meeting to see if I was still around, and she still didn’t seem interested.
One thing that might be a factor: she’s mentioned feeling nervous around men in general. She told me outright that I make her nervous—not because of anything I’ve done, but because I could hurt her. I asked if she’d had bad experiences with men before, and she said not really—just a creepy guy at a bar once. Which, fair enough, but at the same time, I feel like I’ve done everything possible to show I’m not some sketchy dude. I have a public career. I have photos with friends (including female friends) on social media. I suggested meeting in broad daylight at a mall or a bookstore. I know anyone can be a predator and I really empathize that women have to constantly consider that, but I don’t know what else I can feasibly do to ease her anxiety. Frankly, if she’s that scared of men, why is she on a dating app in the first place?
At this point, I feel like I’m stuck in limbo. She says she likes me, she spends a lot of time talking to me, she acts like she’s into me over the phone, constantly wants e-sex, but when it comes to actually seeing each other in real life, she won’t take that step. I don’t want to pressure her into it but she keeps bringing up dates and romance and how she wants to ***** my ***** until I **** so obviously I keep mentioning the possibility of us doing something. 

I would write this off as just attention-seeking but she really does seem to put in a lot of effort for it to be that, which is where the confusion is. I’m okay with waiting to go on a full date or whatever, but it feels like we’ve hit a plateau and I want some sort of reassurance that even if us meeting won’t happen for a month or so, that it will happen at some point. 

So… what do? ",2,1738220019.0,dating_advice,11,1.0,False

Today, I had a *really bad* anxiety attack, was able to calm myself down but my body was *still* feeling the aftereffects; ie, heart paplations         *(though not as bad)*. And didn't feel tired despite it being 12:00 at night as because of my previous anxiety,I didn't feel sleepy). So I went on my phone for an hour, half to calm my mind down, also because I assumed that after a while I would probably feel tired by going on my phone for so long, *right?* Well, success! It worked...but...I spent an *hour and a half* more on my phone than the time that I felt tired. Which was stupid, I know. But after that hour and a half, I felt ready to go to sleep, *finally!* Except.., my stupid brain, decided *now*... is a good time to overthink and I overthought...about *many, many*, different things. And..even though I put on music, tried to sleep, I was just lying in bed, doing nothing, feeling frustrated. So, *resigned to my fate*, I went on my phone, went on insta, saw a AITA post, asking for advice, spent almost half an hour writing a response *just* for an auto-moderator to say *""that replies for the post, that are over 5 days, are automatically deleted"".* So I got my comment deleted. But, whatever.

I looked at some more Reddit posts, put my phone down, tried to sleep again, but couldn't because of my over-thinking. My *brain was basically being too active*, *still is* for me to sleep right now. So, I resigned myself to *continue* going on my phone, accepted my fate, that I wlll probably feel tired or will stop overthinking in a few hours. And where I am at, it is currently 6:38 in the morning, meaning, I will probably have a few hours sleep, max. 

Also, in case anyone asks why what are one of the things I am anxious/over-thinking about. Basically, I need to send a medical report to my dad, so that he can send it to his *insurance company*, so that they can *re-imburse him* for my session with a *private psychiatrist*,  then I can continue my sessions with my pschartist. And all of that needs to be done...*today*. So I am basically, screwed, know that I won't be able to fall asleep until later; only thing is I dread how I will feel tomorrow, late morning or afternoon. I know I will probably feel tired. I know that I will have to either; take coffee later in the day tomorrow, or take a nap.

The drinks don’t taste that good and a little watery even when turning the intensity up and using the bean adapt feature.

However even with 24 grams of coffee at a grind size of 17(using a DF54), leaves a lot of space between the top of the puck screen surface and the basket lip. Is this supposed to be this way? It definitely seems to be more than a quarter’s thickness. (Of course the grind size matters. But I’m sure my grind size isn’t too fine)

The espresso flow seems faster with less crema compared to the stock basket using the exact same grind size and 19g dose.
Perhaps the 22g basket was the wrong choice for the bambino plus(?), and I should get a 20g basket.",1,1738219181.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Also keen to hear what other people do when they have a cold! 

*Not a doctor, not medical advice, just what I do, YMMV* 

1. Take plain painkillers. They're much easier to find and cheaper than cold&sinus ones. Write down when you take them - DO NOT take more than recommended. 
2. Drink lots of plain hot water, or hot water with honey, for a sore throat/cough and for adding moisture to your sinuses and body.
3. Humidify your body (if you can't humidify your whole space) by sitting in front of a large bowl of lightly boiled water and breathing in the steam. Long hot showers work too, but take more water/energy. 
4. Use a hot rice/wheat bag or water bottle to keep yourself warm. Bags can be made from old clothing and old rice and heated in the microwave. 
5. Cut up old clothing/underwear for tissues - they're so much softer on your face and skin than disposable ones. They can also be washed and reused - I keep mine in 2 old mini flower pots, 1 for clean and 1 for dirty, and wash them separately from other items. 
6. Clean your space as soon as you have energy. Even just spraying counters with disinfectant/soap/cleaner, changing sheets (or just pillowcases), wearing clean clothing and undergarments. 
7. Open windows to exchange stale air for fresh air - even for just 5 minutes, or just in a bedroom. Do as it is safe for you. And if you can also go and sit outside for a moment (on a balcony/doorstep/patio) - the fresh air can feel wonderful, imo even more so when it's very cold outside. 

BONUS: Remember to keep up with taking any prescribed medicines/vitamins you already take (including small amounts of coffee/tea/caffeine) and double check any interactions with painkillers. 

Most of this is free or nearly free - and could be tried before having to visit a pharmacy/doctor ($). I sincerely hopes it helps someone. 

TL;DR: When you're sick with a cold, you don't need to buy much - take basic painkillers, keep your body warm and moist, use cloth tissues where feasible, get fresh air and wash your sheets. 

Take care everyone. ",6,1738219106.0,Anticonsumption,3,1.0,False

   I plan on moving in August/September, 2 locations in mind PDX with my sister, or CA with my uncle either way I will be paying rent. Right now I drive a 2004 Mazda hatchback 207,500- with TCM/ECU problems, my car thinks it’s going 60mph in a 10pm zone to the naked eye it’s fine but looking under the hood for a diagnosis I was told I was driving a ticking time bomb, even tho my RPM’s don’t jump crazy at all, the brain of the car is acting as if it’s on crack. So 3 ideas. 

With my job I plan on having 10k really close to 11k, my current roommate is tagging along as well and he’ll have around 14k. But we are not joining financially, I refuse to rely on him once agin because I just hate relying on people it’s not very dependable, anyway.

-option 1- 
say I choose CA, my car right now would definitely not pass emission requirements being the tcm/ecu problems, and my car being at 207,500 currently it may not last that long till Aug. but if it did I would have to fix my car anyway, and a tcm/ecu fix is no joke lol. On top of that if my car did make it to CA it wouldn’t make it 3 more months after the move like no way. So buy a car in CA 
(Wich is more expensive than WA right now) and pray my car can make to that point.

-option 2
Buy a used car in WA soon, then move out with 8k instead. If I buy a used car soon for like 3k
 (my Mazda was 3k) then that would set me back to only having 1k (I would buy in 2 months) at that point and my timeline I would only have 8k to move out wich is a scary option to me, considering it took 6 months for someone to hire me like 20 diff Starbucks didn’t even want me lol I have BookKeeping experience and a freaking coffee shop wouldn’t even take me…. I was also Rovering/insta carting while looking for a job so I was still getting money just not enough nor consistent flow. 

Option 3-

Financing a car for like 4k-6k, I do not want to finance a car just incase I crash and total it then I’m paying for a car I don’t even drive anymore. On top of that this so what I would be paying.

Insurance - depends on the car 
Car payment -depends on the car
Dog food/care-70 bi monthly 
Service bill-50
Grocery’s-150
Toilet trees/kitchen toilet trees-150 bi monthly sometimes 3 months

I get paid 1.5k a month so I would be savings saving as fast with the insurance and payment plan and would have less money to move out.

Shincheonji (SCJ) Cult Actively Recruiting in Orange County","If someone **invites you to a “nondenominational Bible study”** but refuses to name their church, **be extremely cautious**—it’s likely **Shincheonji (SCJ), a deceptive cult** that aggressively recruits young people **both in-person and on Zoom.** SCJ operates **covertly**, using **manipulation and deception** to lure members in **without revealing their true identity** until it’s too late.

🚨 **How They Recruit:**

* **They seem friendly, well-spoken, and eager to discuss the Bible**—but will **never** admit they are from SCJ upfront.
* They invite you to **a “neutral” Bible study** that appears intellectual and open-minded, **claiming to offer hidden knowledge** no one else has.
* **Most of their recruitment now happens on Zoom,** making it even easier for them to **hide their true identity** until you’re deeply involved.
* They **love-bomb you**—giving you **free meals, emotional support, and deep conversations** to make you feel valued and connected.
* They **gradually monopolize your time**, increasing meeting frequency **from twice a week to three or more days**, with **sessions lasting later into the night**.
* By the time they reveal they are SCJ, **you are already emotionally and mentally invested**, making it harder to leave.

🕵️‍♂️ **Where They Operate:**

SCJ recruiters **frequent these locations** to approach young adults:

* **On Zoom & Social Media** – They often **DM people on Instagram, Facebook, and Discord** with invitations to ""Bible discussions"" and ""prophecy studies.""
* **Panera Bread** (Lakewood, Cerritos, Irvine, Tustin, Lake Forest)
* **Coffee shops & public spaces** (7 Leaves, Coffee Code, Terra Mia, Starbucks, Bodhi Leaf, Philz Coffee, Wushiland Boba, Mugs, The Source OC, etc.)
* **College campuses** (CSULB, CSUF, UCI, local community colleges) – often in libraries and student areas
* **Department stores** (Macy’s, Kohl’s, Hobby Lobby)

🚩 **If someone invites you to a Bible study but won’t say what church they’re from—IT’S LIKELY SCJ.**

💬 **What You Can Do:**

* **ASK your acquaintances if they are involved** in a group like this. **SCJ members are never explicit about their involvement**—many ex-members say they **hid it for years** because SCJ **taught them to deceive others** to “avoid persecution.”
* **Warn others.** They **specifically target young adults** looking for friendship, faith, or community.
* **Ask direct questions.** If they hesitate or **refuse to name their church**, that’s a major **red flag**.
* **Report them to business managers.** Some locations have **already kicked them out** for predatory recruitment.

**Why This is a Serious Concern:**

SCJ’s **manipulative tactics** have **destroyed relationships, caused students to drop out of college, and led to severe emotional and financial harm.**

* **Time Manipulation:** Bible studies start at **twice a week** but quickly **increase to 20+ hours per week**—causing students to **neglect their coursework and responsibilities**.
* **Secrecy & Isolation:** **Members are pressured to hide their involvement** from family and friends, making it **harder for them to escape.**
* **Psychological Manipulation:** **Doubts are framed as spiritual failures**, making members feel like **leaving SCJ is rejecting God.**
* **Financial Exploitation:** **They pressure students to donate money**, even when they are struggling, claiming that **“God will provide.”**
* **Fake Friendships:** They **befriend you to keep you invested**, but if you leave, **they block you and cut you off immediately**.
* **Stalking & Harassment:** **SCJ collects personal information**, including **photos (t**hey often take **“selfies” with you** as a cover for **keeping records** of recruits**), addresses, and contact details**. Some ex-members report **SCJ showing up at their homes** to pressure them into returning.
* **Data Collection & Surveillance:** SCJ **gathers personal information** on members without their knowledge and asks about personal relationships which they later encourage you to cut off.
* **Files on Members:** SCJ **tracks members' attendance, personal details, and progress** in secret files.
* **Betrayal by Friends:** The **“friends” you make in SCJ report all your doubts** to instructors, who then **tailor lessons to manipulate you further** and keep you from leaving.

🚨 **This is NOT just a religious group.** This is a **high-control, manipulative cult** that **psychologically traps students, isolates them from loved ones, and drains their time, energy, and finances.**

🚨 **More Resources:**

* **Pastor Ezra (Buena Park)** actively exposes SCJ and **confronts their Bible classes in person**. His YouTube channel, **""Free of Shincheonji,""** provides **detailed breakdowns of SCJ’s tactics** and how to counter them.
* **Ex-SCJ testimonies confirm** that their **entire recruitment process is based on deception and psychological control. Feel free to check the 'Shincheonji' subreddit for witness testimony, support and information.**

Apples- crunchy and wet. Disgusting. Do not like the taste, smell or sound. Skin is gross. Hate apple flavor candy. I will drink apple juice.

Bananas- absolutely disgusting in every possible way. Mushy, stringy, smells bad, tastes bad. Banana flavor anything, No. Barfed one time when my mom forced me to eat one

Grapes- don't like the taste, or the popping (hate boba, too) I will drink grape juice

oranges- I HATE the smell. It sticks to everything, and is incredibly overwhelming, in childhood it would genuinely give me nausea. Don't like how its juicy and the skin pops, or the stringy white bits, or having to peel it. I will drink orange juice, no pulp

Watermelon- crunchy and wet. Don't like the smell or taste.

Berries- again, the popping. I like strawberry or blackberry flavored things, like jam or yogurt, but NO CHUNKS

Pineapple- disgusting in texture and taste all around

Tomatoes- I will eat in a sauce, or if they're sun dried cherry tomatoes cooked in a pan as an ingredient in a meal, I love that. Never raw. seeds, wet and crunchy. Anything with seeds inside, and this kind of texture, i Tend to find disgusting. Squash, cucumber, etc. Won't even eat those cooked

I love most vegetables. I've grown to like a lot of things I used to avoid, but fruit has not been one of those things. Like I said i will drink multiple fruit juices, but I don't think I can get the full nutritional value from them. Plus, the only drinks I reach for Regularly are water, diet coke, Tea and coffee. Low carb is easier, because I am type 1 diabetic. Sometimes I wonder if this fruit aversion is related to that, a sort of aversion from the natural high power sugars present in fruit.

Build quality is amazing. I feel its better than my c40.

i feel like im a little bit dramatic, overthinking the whole thing, but the other day, there were three instances of men being rude or creepy and it really made me consider if this job is actually worth the potential risk. 

i was only working 4 hours that day. there were three different instances in FOUR hours. 

so the first instance happened literally 10 minutes after i clocked in. we have a lot of homeless people in the area and they always come and steal which is like...okay do your thing i can't stop you anyway, but recently our front door got smashed and the owners of the store aren't going to do anything about it so i guess the homeless people are really starting to act out. so this guy comes to the till and he has a pair of pants and he tells me that my supervisor apparently said i could give him a discount for the pants because there was something poking out of it. i look at the thing and it's literally just the tag, i cut it off and tell him i wont be discounting it because obviously i knew that my supervisor did not say i could discount it otherwise she would've told me directly. as im ringing him up he keeps asking me for a discount and i tell him that the pants are in perfect condition so there's nothing i can possibly discount them for. he pays and then he asks me if we have a change room, i tell him no. so he steps outside the store (onto the sidewalk near the street) and STARTS UNDRESSING! like he is literally in his underwear. i immediately go outside and tell him off, i say to him that if he wants to change into the pants then he can walk down to the coffee shop and use their bathroom, but there is no way in hell he's gonna do that right in front of the store. he grabs his junk, flips me off, and gets on his bike and rides away. i call my supervisor and im obviously really pissed off because...what the fuck? we have customers here, some of which are CHILDREN who absolutely do not need to see this disgusting person in his underwear and grabbing his junk. i tell my supervisor and she literally just shrugs, and says that there is nothing we can do because he's technically ""outside"" of the store and it's not on our property. ??? but when the front doors got smashed and there was glass all over the sidewalk apparently i still have to go and sweep that up because it's our ""property"" ??? (obviously the glass couldn't be left there, im just saying it's weird) and so yeah, no ban, no police, NOTHING. they just let this guy do this. 

so for the second time i was sitting outside on the bench and vaping on my break when this guy comes up to me and was like ""damn girl it's cold as hell out here but you're a smokeshow so i bet you're not cold""...like? i do not want to be approached by men, at all. that was not rizz 😭 honestly it was a little bit funny bc of how random it was but seriously? 

and then later that night i was cleaning up the carts and bringing them to the cart rack inside the store when two guys (one was like 16, the other was like 40) say that i should leave with them. i was like, erm no im literally at work and i dont know you. but they were like ""come onnnn we'll have fun"" like gtfo???

This is my first post. My Q left me and our cats a week ago. We had been together for 3 years and married for 1 1/2 of those 3 years. We met in the Fall. When I first met him, I wasn’t really aware there was a drinking problem. But as weeks went on, then I became aware. Still we dated and eventually moved in together. I had been a stoner myself. But I stopped partaking in march the following year. He kept drinking. Hard liquors. Eventually he had enough and went to dry out at a local hospital. Shortly after, he picked it right back up. Throughout the years, he had drank. At some point, I convinced him to seek therapy and a psych doc due to the drinking and bipolar. So, he did. But continue to drink and never sought recovery really. Even though I urged him to. 

So since before thanksgiving this year, I saw a personality change in him. He loves football. And he also loves to smoke. He made himself a “man cave” in our garage. There he drank and smoked and watched football. It became his prison that garage. And stopped really engaging with me. We stopped going places and doing things we used to. And then he became fixated on his elderly dad and his eventual death. Elderly dad has not died btw, just very sick. Then we started arguing and we never used to argue. He was then talking about divorce because he felt like he was a burden to me and like he was dragging me down. And that I would be the one to leave eventually and he couldn’t handle that. So then we decided to go to marriage counseling and he would start smart recovery. But marriage counseling didn’t happen and smart recovery was once or twice. And drinking in the garage was all that was happening. 

We had stressors such as money as I was the only one working and in school full time to become a nurse practitioner. He was a retired professor, who also wanted to become a clinical psychologist. He was unemployed and on disability, Professorships with PhDs in English are no longer a thing. He couldn’t really find in any work in that field.

So last week he mentioned he was going to visit his father and said he would be gone for a few days. I said ok. He brought me my morning coffee and gave me a kiss and said he was leaving and I said ok and asked if he would just send me his ETA. He said he would. Father lives 2 hours from us. He never sent his ETA and then I started to freak out. Like something just shifted in my guts. I felt it in my guts that he just like left me. I started calling, then he blocked me. 

The next morning while I was work, trying to hold it together, I noticed he moved his phone line to another carrier. He excluded me as a driver on his car insurance. All these things came to my email. 
I freaked out again and it dawned on me that we are separating. 

The day after he messaged me, said that he was on a binge and was about to “lose it” and that he needed to get some help. Meanwhile I’m actually losing it. Had no idea where he was and also he had blocked my number. So happens I called the landlord to get my name on the lease because he had left and find out from the landlord that my husband is in Arkansas with his guy friend and we were separating.

The next day he text me that he “slept well” and he was looking into some treatment. So that pretty much set me off. So I sent email, expressing how
much all this hurts and how leaving me was inconsiderate I felt and hurtful. He replied back, “that is heavy stuff. And i will not unblock you for now”

Again I lose it and start to grieve. And have been grieving ever since. I write him an email last saying how much I loved him and pretty much affirming him and what his drinking has done as well and how I wanted him to thrive and heal. I tried not to be accusatory or pointing fingers. 

Today he tells me he is relocating to be closer to his son and to get equine therapy and IOP. Starting his healing journey. He thanked me for kind supportive words and he also affirmed me. He said I was wonderful and Left me a P.O. Box address and a physical address to his dads house. 

What wasn’t in that email…an apology. No where in the email. Was there an apology.

He did admit that “f***uped-ness was entirely his fault and not mine. 

Also I didn’t see in the email any plans for this “separation.”

Also he left a lot of his stuff in now what is “my” place.

So while I’m glad he is getting help, I’m still perplexed. Like I’m still grieving him. I’m confused. 
 
I thought I was a supportive wife and I’m also in therapy for burnout from my very long nursing career. Now my therapy has transitioned to support and uplifting and empowerment through the grieving process. 

When we met, we fell in love and traveled together and great travel companions.  just lovely times and long talks and supportive of one another. 

But I was always afraid that he would die of alcoholism.

I just need input. I’m exhausted. I’m sad and I’m disgusted. I love him. I’m angry. I’m glad he is getting the help he needs. But why did he feel like he needed to leave me. And I didn’t cause this.

I finally found a reasonable time to get alcohol, as finances are difficult.

I first want to start out with a question. Do you like Steel Reserve High Gravity? If not, why? I personally think it is just fine but not great. It tastes like a more flavor forward lager (barely a hint of hops) but with low bitterness. It's still my go-to for a cheap buzz as it is $8 for a 6 pack of 16oz. The bitterness is similar to that of Pabst Blue Ribbon where it tastes a little sweet but doesn't linger too long. Fairly refreshing too. 

Steel Reserve is not a favorite, I would give it a 6/10 for taste and a 9/10 for value for buzz. Four Loko will absolutely fuck most people up but it's gross tasting. And from my experience, BeatBox makes vomiting way too easy.

Corona Familiar on the other hand is tasting a lot better than the Steel Reserve. It has a tackier mouthfeel with a more pleasant sweet taste, and a flavor profile that I can describe as a mix between lager and stout but with more emphasis on a bitter roasted coffee taste. It doesn't taste like coffee but the bitter note resembles it. These darker Mexican beers are fantastic, I'd put Corona Familiar closely behind Dos Equis XX Ambar Especial as Dos Equis is my favorite beer. 

I only reserve numbered ratings to specific beverages as making up my mind is difficult until I spend plenty of time experiencing them, my opinion is just an opinion after all! Don't feel bad if your opinion is different than mine. I'd love to hear your thoughts on these.

Little tipsy when writing this post, excuse grammatical errors. If drunken typing were a sport, I'd have a platinum medal. I wouldn't consider myself too drunk currently though.",3,1738218300.0,alcohol,5,1.0,False

How will putting a water cup into the pos work? Ik there won’t be a button to pay for it, so will it give me the option to put it in after there’s another item added? Or will there be no button at all and I have to get the water cup myself after the purchase is made?

Adding onto the previous question… a lot of customers will say they want a water cup AFTER I ring them up. Will I just have to get the water cup myself? Or do I tell someone on bar?

For americanos, iced coffee, cold brew, and etc., do I put “w/ room” on the pos if they want cream/milk? Or do I add that they want it added onto the pos?

oh also refills. Can they only get refills if their 1st purchased drink was for here/personal cup? or can they have had purchased the drink in a single use cup, then get a refill in a for here/personal?

The only semi-solution I’ve found is very low intensity norb sun full spectrum bulbs (1000 lux, 5600K) with an orange filter added and sit under this the whole day, shut off the lights 3 hours before bed. It’s critical that I don’t miss that 3 hour window of time where I can fall asleep before the effects of light therapy wear off and I crash into a rebound state of my brain feeling overly stimulated or fatigued mentally but unable to sleep. Has anyone experienced this regularly? Doctors I’ve talked to have never heard of this and some don’t even seem to believe me. If I do light therapy 1 day and then skip the next day, I’m awfully fatigued the day that follows the light therapy day. The brighter the light I did, the worse it is. It’s almost like light is an illicit drug that makes my serotonin levels volatile. Why serotonin? I tried an SSRI and had a similar problem/feeling. Sunlight does not have the rebound but the upside takes quite a bit of sun exposure. 1000 lux of artificial light does not feel like 1000 lux of sunlight.",1,1738218065.0,SeasonalAffective,4,1.0,False

I guess I didn’t really have anything to post about lol 😅. There’s this woman that’s in my first class of the day (Masters program) we actually take a lot of the same classes together throughout the week. I’ve liked her as a person for her enthusiasm, smarts, sensitivity and sense of humor right from the start. The more I got to know her the more I was thinking “oh shit! Don’t get too close to this one she’s just your type 😱”. Anyway, I assumed she was straight and off limits so I kept my distance despite her attempts to become more than classmates (more like friends). She would invite me to get coffee or talk after class etc. She’s pretty friendly with everyone so this wasn’t her giving me special treatment or anything btw (just to be clear). Then someone told me she was either gay or bisexual. Actually more than one person said this about her and I naturally was pretty happy to hear that. (Maybe I was just being foolish 😔). She invited to talk after class today under what I thought was the pretense of “revisiting a project topic” for a group we are both in. I was like, “ Sure! Sounds great!” Whelp… very quickly it became obvious that she really just wanted to talk to me about her day/ friends/ apartment/ pets/ parents etc. And I told her all the same stuff about me etc. Our class ended at 2:40pm we talked until 6:30ish (yes! You read that right!) We were having a blast! Honestly I haven’t laughed or connected with someone so effortlessly in years! We only left because the cleaning crew was closing the building we were hanging out at on campus and it was dark outside! The sun had set! We hadn’t noticed! Towards the end of our conversation she brought up the topic of romantic partners. I kept my info very vague. No names or genders. She then looks kinda frustrated and tells me how a couple of our classmates had WRONGLY assumed she was gay or bisexual because of her style and her DIY projects (and some other stupid stuff that has nothing to do with being gay or bisexual at all). She also told me how upset this had made her….(my heart sank 🥺). I managed to school my features and said something like “oh that sucks”. I think I changed the conversation direction pretty easily and without her hearing the tiny cracks forming in my heart 💔. This whole situation sucks! I was being SO careful not to get closer to her! Damnit! 😫 Now after our amazing talk and sharing session she’s thinking we’re closer to being friends and I’m thinking oh fuck my heart it hurts so badly! Anyone got any advice? Besides “create distance” I can’t do that we have multiple classes and projects together and it’s only the second week of the new semester! I feel tricked or like set up somehow (I know I wasn’t but damn that’s how it feels!) ☹️. I guess it was my mistake for being hopeful and listening to the idiots (my classmates).
