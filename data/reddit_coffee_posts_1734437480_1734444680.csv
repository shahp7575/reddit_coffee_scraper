I‚Äôm not sure where to start or what to write exactly. Here‚Äôs a bit of background.

I live in Australia, 36M, originally from South Korea. I‚Äôm married, no kids, and I have a great relationship with my wife.

I‚Äôve worked in the hospitality and food & beverage industry for most of my life in Australia. Opening my own caf√©, restaurant, or bar has been my dream for more than a decade. Designing spaces, creating food and drinks, and providing great experiences to customers is my passion.

Since getting married, working in restaurants and finishing work after 12am hasn‚Äôt been good for my lifestyle or my relationship with my wife (she works during the day). So, two years ago, I started working in caf√©s. Even though the income is lower, I‚Äôve always loved good coffee, and I‚Äôm getting more serious about specialty coffee‚Äîlearning, studying, and improving.

To be honest, for the last five years, I‚Äôve moved jobs quite often‚Äîusually staying for six months or a year. I feel like I‚Äôm impatient, and sometimes business owners haven‚Äôt been fair with me or other staff, which has been stressful. Dealing with unreasonable customers has also been hard (even though I know I should handle it professionally).

I‚Äôd love to start my own business, but I don‚Äôt have enough savings. I keep losing confidence and even think about moving to another industry where I can make more money. I‚Äôve worked with my friend who runs a lawn-mowing business sometimes, and the income is better than hospitality, but I don‚Äôt love it the way I love hospo.

I used to be really good at what I was doing‚Äîproviding great service, managing teams, and helping owners run their businesses. Right now, though, I‚Äôm not working much. I feel unmotivated, my brain feels like a brick, and I‚Äôm not as sharp as I used to be.

Honestly, I feel completely lost.",1,1734444292.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1hgbawn,https://www.reddit.com/r/mypartneristrans/comments/1hgbawn/angry_upset_and_heartbroken/,"Angry, upset, and heartbroken","My wife (MtF) and I have been together for 11 years, 4 1/2 were spent transitioning. After having our child (4), my priority has been making sure that she is taken care of. My wife felt unwanted and so we talked about some boundaries in our relationship so that she could feel wooed by people and understand what she wanted. 

Fast forward a few years and she made a friend who was supportive and loved our daughter. She moved and we talked about moving out of our stupid incredibly red state. My wife has been up to visit her and to look for houses. I‚Äôm thinking this is going to be great and a good move for our family. I find out that while she was up there last, her and her friend got drunk and made out. Her friend freaks out and says they can‚Äôt be friends anymore. This sends my wife into a spiral and I‚Äôm ashamed to admit I was annoyed trying to pick up the pieces and make sure that she was safe and taken care of. They finally talk a bit and are going to meet for coffee to talk about boundaries. 

In my mind, the worst is over and they can work on repairing their relationship and we can move forward with life. All good, right? I‚Äôm still feeling like there‚Äôs something missing, because this isn‚Äôt the first time boundaries have been crossed. I do not go through her phone on the regular. I have only done it once. But I look through messages and read more information that was omitted when she told me what happened. 

I‚Äôm beyond hurt. This was something that we talked about last time it happened and I told her that she needs to work on rebuilding my trust. I don‚Äôt want to tell her that she can‚Äôt be friends with her anymore, but i‚Äôm tired of being made a fool of. Do I keep hiding my true feelings about this? Do I outright tell her I went through her phone? I love her, and have been by her side throughout her transition, but I don‚Äôt know how to keep going on with this, what I deemed, horny teenager phase. We are in our 30s. I birthed our daughter and so my focus is making sure she is taken care of. 

Am I the problem? Am I not supportive enough? And I too lenient? She keeps telling me that if I wasn‚Äôt here she would cease to exist and that we are better off without her and that our daughter deserves a dad. Now I‚Äôm spiraling and don‚Äôt know what to do.

so please excuse any spelling errors.

I started taking Betablocker (Atenolol 25mg) about 2 months ago due to some Extrasystoles (ES). They are just annoying but never really did any symptoms. 

I did everything from Heart MRI, ECG, Ultrasound, 24h ECG and so on. Everything fine so far. 

My cardiologist gave me Atenolol to reduce my ES (which Haven‚Äôt been much - first 24h ECG 1000 in 24h; second one 250 in 24h). My blood pressure was 148/80 right after laying down (i had a coffee an hour before) - usually its between 120-130/70-80 and HR 60-65. A stress ECG (hope this is correct) is planned for Jannuary to see if i still need betablocker.

About 2 weeks ago we switched from Atenolol to Bisoprolol because my BP was totally fine during my last check up.

3 days after the switch my heart started pounding heavy (HR always fine). I also started developing anxiety/panic ‚Äûattacks‚Äú - this on already got better and for some reason some kind of ‚ÄûDizziness‚Äú (BP good). 

I never had these effects on Atenolol and i‚Äòm not sure if its some late effects from Atenolol or current side effects from Bisoprolol.

Maybe anyone had a similar experience.

# Preamble

I started the year having just recovered from injury and a sign up for the Transgrancanaria Classic looming over me (127km). This was by far my longest race to date, and to cut a long story short, it was epic and went well, though not without suffering. I enjoyed it so much I also decided to sign up for the Tenerife Bluetrail 110km in June. I ran shorter ultras in preparation for these and shied away from hill reps out of fear of getting injured again.

  
I ran the Madrid marathon in April, not racing it per se, but for fun as some friends were doing it. I did some marathon focussed workouts the weeks before (apart from that I'd only been doing volume and vert training) and despite not taking it seriously and having quite a few beers the night before, I found myself going at a good rhythm after getting going and ran 2:55 without ""racing"" it. I knew that I definitely had it in me to beat my then PB of 2:53 with a proper training block.

  
After the Tenerife race I decided that 5 or 6 ultras in the first half of the year was enough madness, and to set a long term goal. I signed up for a race more than 6 months away, and though M√°laga would be an interesting alternative to Valencia.

# Training

I kind of accidentally started following the 6 month plan from the Daniel's book. First I dipped my toes in to see if I could hit some of the workouts, then before I knew it I was following the plan. There were some deviations, sometimes I trained less, sometimes more. 

The number one thing I did differently for this block was training 100% based on where I was at - more or less ignoring calculated ranges, heart rate etc. I didn't really set myself a specific goal or vocalise what I was aiming for to anyone. 

The other thing I did differently was running as many races as possible (within reason). 5ks, 10ks and a half marathon. My half was 3 weeks before and I ran 1:16:59, one second faster than my goal time. I also got a 10k PB about 5 or 6 weeks out of 34:30 (generously downhill course).

# Before the race

I always feel ill or like I have a niggle before a race. I started to feel feverish on the flight, and woke up with a horrible headache after my first night. Went for a 6k shakeout run and felt a little better but my heart rate seemed higher than I should have been.

Accidentally over-ordered portion size at lunch the day before. Spanish omelette was enormous, but the ideal quantity of potatoes, in addition to the patatas bravas I'd ordered and some bread. In the evening I just got some supermarket couscous. Didn't calculate how many carbs I'd eaten but it definitely felt enough.

Had a late afternoon nap, which made my headache disappear. Slept pretty well and woke up at half 5 in the morning.

# Race Day

Porridge, banana, yoghurt, coffee. Double checked info on race: no gels given out during the race. Slight panic, think I brought 7 or 8 gels with me.

# Race

Had a good chat with a very fast 22 year old doing the half at the start line. I needed to pee but it was too late. Started running. My original plan was to go out at 3:55 min/km but I was going faster than this. Carried on going. Checked heart rate, all good. Felt like I was controlling my pacing well despite going out faster than planned. Remember doing some maths at 21k and realising I could potentially be on for sub 2:40 but didn't overthink, just kept going. Temperature was cool, ideal conditions. not the most interesting course but that didn't bother me as I'd done some relatively dull courses recently without crowd support.

2-3 gels an hour. Tried to alternate between caffeinated and non-caffeinated. Drank water at approx. half of the stations.

Most surreal moment was overtaking an elite Ethiopian female. Key moment was about 3k from the end on a downhill section, saw that someone was slowing down and decided it was time to pick up the pace and my legs let me. This was the fastest part of the race for me.

Crossed the line and couldn't believe I'd done sub 2:40. Beyond what I thought I had in me.

# Wrap, Reflections & What‚Äôs Next?

Chatted to some other competitors at the finish, one guy's foot was bleeding badly and I helped him gather his things. Went back to hostel to shower and hit the pub. Drank too many beers with a motley crew of runners and non-runners and called it a night early.

Not the most amazing course in the world, but ideal for someone looking for a PB. Great city, great vibes.

What's next? No idea, thinking I like the look of Belfast marathon but would also be good to find another ultra challenge. Also want to lower my 5k and 10k time. ",3,1734443996.0,AdvancedRunning,0,1.0,False
1hgb7ok,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hgb7ok/mixed_feelings_about_a_girl_that_i_loved_that/,Mixed feelings about a girl that I love(d) that made me ask myself if its the right thing,"TL;DR I started a relationship when I wasn't sure on the attraction to her. Mostly I had full feelings for her and other times I said I'm not attracted. I liked her as a person, the chemistry was good and we always had fun together. But I cared so much about her and I didn't want to be in a relationship with mixed feelings that I think wont pass by the time, and mostly I wouldn't want to hurt her feelings as we deepen the relationship, so I ended it.

I (M 22) met this girl (F 25) on military reservations. I always saw her and didn't think anything about her, she just 'was there'. Near the end of our deployment, we had interactions that made us think we are starting with each other. We started to chat with each other, and I invited her to sit with me just as a friend. The day after we decided to meet at someplace to talk. We sat down and we started talking about what's happening. She wanted to give it a try (she was attracted by that time) and I was like well she is not my exact type but I think I can deal with it. we agreed to take it to the next step. We talked 3 hours that night. I felt she accepted **everything,** also things that I thought that make me weird. I didn't like a bit of her character but it didn't really matter to me. The next 7 days after we had that decision, we were together every night at a far corner of our base, and talked for hours on hours, in fact my sleep time didn't matter to me as I was having fun, and at a time that I was allowed to go home I preferred to stay with her more time than be at my home sooner. It started really fast because I knew her before. In that week she was my first kiss. it was a bit strange to me because I told myself she is not quite my taste in looks and maybe its not the right thing to do. after that it wasn't strange anymore and she taught me how to kiss and it felt quite normal to me.

After that week the deployment has ended. When I was without her, my feelings had left a bit. I told myself that she makes me feel special and we have fun with each other but sometimes I feel that I'm not attracted to her. We had an event a week after the deployment ended and I came loaded with thoughts that I need to end it. We sat down and I told her that sometimes I don't have feelings for her though the amazing chemistry. She was very hurt and walked away. When she walked away I asked myself what have I done, I don't want it to end. she was very hurt that day and it made me sad because although I decided to do it when I got to that moment it I reminded the good times we had. Later that day she told me she didn't know what has happened because I didn't talk to her too much about that. she told me that I didn't even give it a chance to see if the time will do its job and all the imperfections will fade away. We talked about that and decided that I should give it a chance and some more time, as we didn't meet outside the deployment. My special feelings for her came back on steroids and I we were talking on facetime almost every day for hours. We decided to meet to see how its going. She came to my city for a bday party so she came to sleep with me so we could wake up the next morning and have a coffee date. we went to sleep late and we woke up too late and she had to go because someone from the party needed to go home and she came with her.

After that time my feeling went up and down. sometimes I'm in love and sometimes I feel like she's not for me. A week later we met, I drove to her and while driving I told myself I need to break up, and I still met with her. I had fun and it didn't matter to me as the feelings came back. The 4 hour date has ended, and I still asked myself is it is the right thing. A 3 days passed by and and didn't think about her anymore and I decided to break up because I'm not having the feelings all the time for her but I always loved her in person. I called her and said that the same feelings came back and I wanted to finish it. We broke up as she was in love and I wasn't sure about the relationship. Right away again all my feelings came back and I felt like I did a mistake but also the right thing. She still said that I didn't give it a chance and we both said we are not giving it another try.

Wearing a pair of slacks and a sapphire blue button-up I arrive at work, unbeknownst of the events ahead. She arrives shortly after I do, her hair still wet from an early morning shower, wearing a black pencil mini skirt showing off the beauty of her legs, and a tight white short-sleeved button-up, with the top buttons undone as if she knows that anyone glancing in her direction will be driven crazy. 

As I settle in for the work day ahead she walks over to my desk with a sultry look in her eyes. Bending over, her legs straight and her chest at eye level, she starts asking me a question. After a moment she realizes that I have become completely distracted, not hearing a word she has said. She places her hand on my leg to get my attention, of which attention was gained. She glances down, noticing the bulge beginning to slowly grow underneath my pants. Letting out a devilish giggle her hand slides up my leg, purposefully grazing the bulge as she smiles, stands up and walks away towards the kitchen. 

I sit there for a moment, trying to process what just happened, realizing that the bulge has now become fully erect. Adjusting myself I get up and head towards the washroom, trying to devise a way to deal with the situation that has arisen, still in a state of bewilderment. In order to reach the washroom I must pass her, as she stands at the kitchen counter preparing a morning coffee. As I begin to pass she intentionally steps backwards, pushing into my erection with a playful giggle. I place my hands on her hips, contemplating for a second to pull her closer into me. Instead I grip softly, my fingers tenderly pressing into her flesh, as I slowly push her away. She grips onto the counter-top letting out a faint moan as I continue towards the washroom.

I enter the washroom, shutting the door. As I reach to lock it the door swings open, she enters with a fiery look in her eyes locking the door behind her. In the span of a brief moment she has pushed me up against the wall, pulling herself in closely as she kisses me passionately. Leaning in closely, biting my ear as she softly draws my earlobe between her teeth whispering only the words ""I want you"". She backs up towards the bathroom counter, teasingly raising her skirt as I notice she is wearing nothing underneath, unable to refrain myself any longer I pick her up and place her firmly on the counter-top, my hand wrapping around her head, her hair tousled between my fingers we kiss deeply. 

Giggling she pushes my head down towards her legs, I run my hands firmly down the back of her legs as I kiss her inner thighs softly, running my tongue lightly along the inside. I bury my face inside of her as my tongue presses between her lips, opening them to me. As I lick long and hard her hands grip my hair, pushing my face harder against her flesh. I am making circles around her clit with the tip of my tongue as she starts to let out loud moans, her legs now wrapped around my back, squeezing in elation. She begins to twitch slightly as she grips my hair tightly and pulls me up, licking the wetness around my lips as she kisses me. 

She reaches down, unbuckling my belt and unzipping my pants as her feet reach up pulling everything down to the floor, exposing myself to her. Her hand grips tightly around my stiff cock, stroking slowly as she pushes me backwards towards the wall. She lifts herself up off the counter, unzipping the back of her skirt as it slides gracefully down her legs. Stepping out of the skirt piled on the floor she turns around, bending over gripping the counter-top she spreads her legs, inviting me inside of her. I grip her hips as I slowly enter inside her, thrusting deep so she can feel every inch of me as I enter inside her. My hand raises and grips her shoulder, pulling it tightly towards me as I push harder. She moans deeply as my other hand begins to reach around to her now exposed midriff, pressing hard against her warm flesh I firmly slide my hand downwards. My fingers rub her clit as I thrust in and out of her, our bodies synchronized in rapturous momentum. She squeezes tightly around my cock as she lets out a euphoric moan, my cock plunging deep as we cum simultaneously.

We stand in silence for a moment, breathing heavily, taking in all of what just happened. We compose ourselves and exit the washroom, making our way back to our respective desks in an attempt to be productive for the day as our co-workers begin to arrive. We look at each other intensely, knowing what happened only moments ago, both thinking to ourselves....""If only HR knew""...",1,1734443792.0,u_SevenSins5,0,1.0,False

she said when she feels bad she feels REALLY BAD like she wants to die and she hates herself.  and then when she feels good again she feels SO GOOD she thinks the lows will not come again but then they do.  she feels like she is looping on a rollercoaster with no way to get off.

we saw a psych nurse last week who proscribed prozac for her anxiety, OCD and depression but her dad and i have held off on giving it to her as we read all the black box warnings and have been freaking out about possible severe side effects.  (we have hydroxyzine in the interim but its efficacy seems to have worn off).  now i am seeing if there is anyway she is on the bipolar spectrum- prozac is a huge NO NO and could actually activate latent bipolar and make it worse.  i have reached out to the psyche nurse and waiting to hear back but also looking into seeing a psychiatrist as i think we may  need someone more experienced.

last night i spent hours reading about cyclothymia- which feels like the right diagnosis.  i am not trying to diagnose in the sense of not having a professional do it- i just needed to ascertain if trying the SSRI could be damaging and i think i have enough idea that this could be cyclothymia that my concerns about prozac are warranted.

but last night i found this reddit page and read about cyclothymia being confusing with BPD and now i am confused and unsure.  how can i discern between the two as we wait to hear back from the psych nurse and/or see a psychiatrist?  it seems an SSRI can be good for BPD but not for cyclothymia.  i do not want to make her ups and downs worse or activate a worser version of bipolar.

thank you

MORE INFO

her cycles are hours- up and down constantly

she has had mental health issues since around age 8 when her parents divorced- she also has had medical/dental traumas where she felt out of control and things were happening to her (blood test, tooth pulled).  

she got diagnosed with scoliosis and her mental health got WAY WORSE- she experiences the bracing and exercises as really stressful.  she began cutting when she got her brace a year ago.  due to non compliance we now need surgery- she does not want surgery and is refusing both surgery and bracing/exercises

i do not feel she switches in how she views others- like BPD- she seems to remain consistent about everyone expect me her mom who she is definitely going through love/hate dynamics with as i am the single parent managing everything making her wear her brace, giving her limits on tech, etc...  but everyone else does not have high/lows- but her self concept most definitely does

she just started her cycle in this last year during all of this too

she drinks excessive coffee, eats tons of sugar, stays up late- all things i have been worried about and i see are bad for bipolar.  she does not drink or do drugs but i see addictive patterns BIG TIME that make me worried about those kinds of substances later in life.  

BUT for BPD almost all of those symptoms resonate too- particularly this 'engaging in substance use is not necessarily a sign that a person has BPD. However, if they engage in such behavior in order to avoid problems or feelings, or to manage emotions, that might be considered a sign of the condition.'  she uses coffee, sugar and tech in this way BIG TIME

i saw online that inconsistent reinforcement at home could be part of the issue- she has this between her parents.  i have healthy limits, some rules- her dad has nothing and it's a free for all.  to be clear my limits are 3 hours on tiktok not 7+ hours- go to bed by 1/1:30pm on weekends not stay up till 4am or stay up all night.  my limits are not bad by any means.  she has tons of freedom with me but it appears that unless she has total control and freedom- i am a bad mom and mean and too strict

i do see the mood swings triggered by interpersonal stressors (definitely between us) but i also see them come and go even when she gets everything she wants and there are no interpersonal stressors (i.e. i have tried just giving her everything she wants and it does not make her magically always happy and positive) ",1,1734443339.0,cyclothymia,0,1.0,False

I'm (M26) not a good person, I've lived enough to see what kind of person I am, how I respond to certain situations or circumstances, and I figured out 3 main thing about myself that has led me to this conclusion:

1. I am downright selfish, and every time I ever did something that was ever generous or helpful, it was always with an ulterior motive or purely because it was for me in some roundabout way

2. I have a complete inability to handle anything bad beyond surface level. I'm not the type to call out of work because I spilled coffee on my shirt, but I am the type to let a small nagging problem at work fester into me collapsing on the job from a panic attack and resigning from the hospital. I've now had FOUR (4) General/Area Management jobs that ended in this type of fashion, after leaving easier jobs that I had worked but was miserable at due to pay and lack of responsibility/inability to be effective with my skillset and experience

3. I have nothing to offer anybody outside of my family, therefore lost my chance at love and happiness when my engagement fell apart last year. I'm now at an age where options are limited more every day for me, and every day progressively look worse. I cannot workout due to medical conditions that will take anywhere from 6-12 months to resolve, so have become fat and slovenly due to lack of exercise and depressive eating/doing nothing all day. I lost my hair to the point that shaving it all off looked better than what I had, so i've been 1-buzzed for over a year, there goes a whole cadre of options for me. I have nothing to offer a romantic partner, therefore there is no reason for me to deserve a romantic partner, unless they're just as worthless a person as I am, which wouldn't really be a great relationship anyways. and I refuse to be alone, I would rather kill myself. 

  
Every therapist I talk to makes me feel worse, and I'm writing this as I will be running out of money in about 2 weeks, and will most likely kill myself or, if I don't have the ball (lost one to cancer) to, leave my parents' house in the middle of the night to become homeless and die quicker.

NON-US IMG

Study time: **5-6** months 



I started studying for Step 2 during my internship and cleared the exam two years ago. I began with UWorld, which I considered the gold standard for learning, and completed 70% of the questions with an average of 75-80% correct. After a month's hiatus, I started Amboss and completed 100% of the questions with an average of 80% correct. I also used First Aid for Step 2 CK but found it unhelpful and would only recommend it for topics you have no idea about.

I didn't have much time to study for my internship. My schedule was 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM, including 3-4 hours of transit time. I used that time to do Anki (anking deck) and completed about 50-60% of the deck. I also did Amboss questions on my Samsung Fold. I started taking NBME practice exams, but just as I was about to schedule my test date, I had a severe IBD flare-up and lost 20 kg. I was unable to study for two months. After starting infliximab, I was able to stabilize my condition and resume my studies. In the last one to two months, I focused on reviewing Amboss incorrect questions (approximately 700) and thoroughly reviewing each NBME exam, analyzing each question I got wrong. I discovered that I was consistently losing points on questions with dates and questions about when to treat varicoceles, umbilical hernia, cryptorchid testis, and similar conditions.

 I used INNER CIRCLE Notes in the last two weeks of my preparation, and they were a blessing. They are the best notes I found for Step 2, and I owe a lot of my score to them. I wouldn't recommend using them in the initial periods of your prep, as they contain a lot of direct facts from NBMEs that could inflate your score. I finished the whole of the notes in the last two weeks by glossing over stuff I mostly knew and focusing on the dates and difficult topics. CMS forms are definitely recommended if you are looking for a higher score. I recommend them for the later parts of your prep, as they help you to understand and get accustomed to the testing style of NBME, which is different from Uworld and Amboss.



Study schedule 

Divide your prep in 2 phases 

First: just use Uworld and Amboss maybe anking if you like Anki and have a weak step 1 foundation these are enough for the initial phase what I did is divide the total questions by the number of days example 4000q √∑ 80q per day is just 50 days recommend this way of thinking. 

Second: in the intensive phase start your name assessment and take it seriously take as much as you need for reviewing and think about WHY you chose that question and why you couldn't at least rule out other options, CMS forms are not that hard The most important are the last 2 of FM, IM and ob-gyn, neuro ones are harder, inner circle notes if you have time go for 2 repetitions. 

When I took them off from the internship what I did was get up at 6-7 am studies names till 3 pm went to the gym and start the second part of my day around 5-6 pm and study inner circle notes, AMBOSS QI, ethics, biostatistics.

 Used Divine only while working out don't know how much that helped 

REAL DEAL, had eggs for breakfast and sweets and lots of coffee but experience it beforehand and how you react to it.

**TRICKS** 

1. The thing is there's always going to be wtf question that you never studied never seen the trick I found most effective is to try to rule out all the other options you can and just go for one that you heard the most about if you haven't Heard of one of the options ever and they seem really odd you probably should not pick them 

2. Always do drug ads in the end, I got almost all of the drug ads (7-8 in my test) because I had ample time to think them through they are doable don't panic just be calm and think through them (if you have 38 questions block that's where the drug ads are ) 

3. NBME topics are repeated emphasis on topics, not questions if you notice NBMEs are really interested in post-splenectomy vaccines then that WILL show up on your exam be sure to know all the topics you notice are repeated in NBMEs 

4. the questions on the real deal are really long so get fast at reading 

 THE REAL TEST IS 90% INSTINCTS so do as many questions as you can I was doing 200-300q per day in my intensive, and remember EVERYONE has excuses and nobody cares about them.

Material 

Top tier : Uworld , Amboss(QI, ETHICS, BIOSTATISTICS) , NBME , CMS FORMS, INNER CIRCLE NOTES 

Middle tier: Amboss all questions, divine podcast,anking, FIRST AID step 2 ck 



If someone has any information on internships, please let me know. I'm looking for an internship in the medical field.

Felt completely awful day 2 3 4 and 5 (nausea, faint). Was aiming for a week but started to get terrible acid reflux / nausea and was getting annoyed with my girlfriend for little things so ended it (the fast not the relationship lol). Never felt hungry, I suppose because I was going directly from a relatively low calorie diet.

I've tried keto diet in the past and had similar results. I wonder if some people just don't feel that immense energy in ketosis, or perhaps it might have emerged in the 6th day if I had toughed it out.

Felt faint often and couldn't engage in regular activity. I managed to attend church and do some shopping but both were a slog. Sleep was poor but dreams were intensely vivid.

Found the experience tough and wouldn't do it again for a while, I would prepare for it more carefully in future. I was being a horrible, irritable, impatient person towards the end of the fast which does make me think about who I am behind all the fluff, and how I judge other people without knowing their experience.

The real worry is weekly chart. Which HAS to correct at some point and I believe it will. It's extremely overbought and ready to fall off a cliff. Needs a huge red candle. All crypto does infact.

But for today!

MACD is rounding the bottom and on its way up. Likely within 2 days we will start rounding the top whish should push us towards that 3.87 resistance.

STOCHASTIC RSI is bullish... its finally given us a good crossover to the upside... should be bullish til near end of the week which I then expect this indicator to become overbought and retrace down, which i think will be the start of the decline on the weekly chart..

I have N2 and ADHD, on adderall since 2020 and on and off with Lumryz for about 9 months.  I struggled with the titration, higher doses of oxybates give me racing heart (petite female) I use the 6g packets.

I usually take my dose around 1030, and read until I fall asleep.  And I wake up around 5am.  UGH.  I still feel super groggy, but can‚Äôt get back to sleep.  I force myself up at 630 to get my kids ready for school, and chug a liquid IV before I get in the shower.  I‚Äôm super guilty of not hydrating, which I feel is important with this salty medicine.  Sometimes I feel kinda dizzy, probably because my salt balance is off.  After I shower, I have matcha (can‚Äôt drink coffee anymore, racing heart) and take my adderall.  Sometimes I take propranolol.

I do think I‚Äôm getting higher quality sleep with lumryz, but I just wish there was MORE of it.  I would like to be asleep when my alarm goes off on weekday mornings.  Tried taking my dose later but still woke up at 5 - fail.  I skip lumryz on weekends to give my body a break from the sodium, and usually wake around 8am and feel like shit.

One side effect I‚Äôm having is dry mouth and suppressed appetite.  Like, I have no saliva!  It sounds silly to say, but it‚Äôs uncomfortable and kinda gross.  Saliva is what keeps your mouth clean!  Is lumryz suppressing my appetite, or is my sleep just so much better that my leptin production is regulated? (I didn‚Äôt have this on just adderall).

**Preparations Before the Trip**

Before you even set foot in Beijing, make sure you have your visa and passport in order. Also, get an esim card or buy a local SIM card at the airport. In China, the apps we usually use don't work. So, download Alipay for payments, WeChat for reserving attractions and chatting with locals, Baidu Maps for navigation, Dianping for checking restaurant info, and a VPN to help you access the internet.

[APP in China](https://preview.redd.it/90j4thy0se7e1.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2e7dcf947a199b1e9ab724af9dbad7020dda413)

**Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City**

It's crucial to reserve your visit to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City on WeChat in advance. Although some say you can buy tickets at the entrance of the Forbidden City, I didn't take that risk. Wake up really early because there are numerous security checks and a large number of tourists. I reached Tiananmen Station, Exit B at 8 am. Just follow the crowd and walk through several security checks to reach Tiananmen Rostrum. Tiananmen is like the front door of China's historical and political stage. It has witnessed many important national events, similar to how the Place de la Concorde in Paris has seen significant moments in French history.

[Tiananmen Tower](https://preview.redd.it/tu898392se7e1.png?width=1522&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f1475fcf54760efed017520b6fadc7ce439750d)

From Tiananmen Rostrum, enter the Forbidden City. Plan to spend 3 - 4 hours exploring. You'll see amazing places like the Hall of Supreme Harmony, which is like the grandest and tallest throne room you can imagine. The Western Six Palaces were where the emperor's concubines lived. It's a bit like the harem concept in some Middle Eastern historical palaces. The Imperial Garden is a beautiful royal landscape. The Forbidden City is filled with historical tales. For example, there are stories of power struggles and intrigues among the imperial family, much like the power plays in the Tudor dynasty in England. And the countless antiques and artworks are like a time capsule of China's imperial past.

**Jingshan Park**

After exiting the Forbidden City from the Shenwumen, cross the road and enter Jingshan Park. It's a small but wonderful park. It used to be part of the imperial complex. From the top, you can enjoy a panoramic view of the Forbidden City and other landmarks like Beihai Park, the Bell and Drum Towers, and the China Zun. It's like a natural observatory deck over the city's historical and modern architectural constellation. You can stand there and feel as if you are at the center of a time-traveling kaleidoscope, where centuries of history and modern development converge and unfold beneath your feet.

[The scenery at the top of Jingshan Park](https://preview.redd.it/ouivp055se7e1.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=08460e3bb5be32b24af1f645be555f25b039e627)

**Dinner at Siji Minfu Roast Duck Restaurant**

After exploring Jingshan, have dinner at the Forbidden City branch of Siji Minfu Roast Duck Restaurant. The roast duck here is delicious. The crispy skin and tender meat are amazing. The traditional Beijing dishes are also very authentic. I was told by my Chinese friend that it's better and cheaper than Quanjude. It's like finding a hidden gem in the world of Beijing cuisine.

[Roast duck](https://preview.redd.it/u17b1jd9se7e1.png?width=1134&format=png&auto=webp&s=6732e439503426adf5c5863e134a68e03fab659a)

**Wudaoying Hutong**

After lunch, take a taxi to Wudaoying Hutong. This hutong is full of unique Chinese charm. In this hutong, you can have a relaxing afternoon tea at Yuangu and buy some traditional Chinese souvenirs. If you're a coffee lover, Fuding Coffee is a great choice and you can enjoy the view of the hutong from the second floor. Pengci'er is a fun place to make traditional Chinese porcelain. And ToSummer offers nice Chinese-flavored perfumes, like tea-scented ones.

**Huaiyangfu and Huaiyang Cuisine**

For dinner, I went to Huaiyangfu. Huaiyang cuisine is one of the major traditional Chinese cuisines. It focuses on highlighting the natural flavors of ingredients. The Flash-oiled Eel is cooked in a special way to bring out its rich taste. The Braised Pork with Mushrooms is tender and full of flavor. The Yangzhou Fried Rice is a classic combination of eggs, rice, and various veggies. It's similar to Italian cuisine in the sense that it pays great attention to the dexterous use of ingredients and the harmony of flavors.

[Some dishes of Huaiyangfu](https://preview.redd.it/jk3lqg7use7e1.png?width=1124&format=png&auto=webp&s=29030a94126574fb58fb6806ca7406780b058c52)

**Evening Drinks at Beixinqiao**

After dinner, take a taxi to the area near Beixinqiao. Aurora Whiskey & Cocktail and Bar Flavour are two really cool bars. Aurora Whiskey & Cocktail has a great selection of drinks and a cozy atmosphere. Bar Flavour is known for its creative cocktails and stylish decor.

[Aurora ](https://preview.redd.it/voz4gut2te7e1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=03332628bbf5a91080bb6c56abc14af7b3476ff4)

**Final Recommendation**

If you have only one day in Beijing, I also highly recommend visiting Mutianyu Great Wall. It's an amazing place to experience China's ancient architecture and natural beauty. And I'd love to hear about your experiences visiting Tiananmen, the Forbidden City, or any other part of Beijing.

Love to ""calm down"" during X-mas and just enjoy the silence, remoteness and walking using public trails through fields, woods, hills and etc.

Sadly, this year, looking at the prices for 2-3 nights, it seems I am no longer going into any of the remote places. I get the inflation and staff, but ¬£1000-¬£1400 for 2-3 nights seems little bit too much this time.

Question. Can anyone recommend a pub/restaurant where I could drive/get to (no matter how remote/isolated/unreachable as have proper 4x4), which would be small/cosy, with fireplace(s), would be dog friendly and would offer some vegetarian options?

Checked few online (chain ones) and so far found only some really big ones (probably will be extremely packed/loud and staff).

Hidden gems preferable.

For example (but it is more a coffee place, not a lodge/pub/restaurant) High Peak Bookstore is quite a nice place.   
Driving through Devon / Dorset few years back, I also bumped into some nice little pubs/restaurants that even during X-mas were opened and were almost empty and it felt like even the staff was happy to have some guests/clients.

1hga4nl,https://www.reddit.com/r/PaperGuidance/comments/1hga4nl/studying_in_groups_vs_studying_alone_what_works/,Studying in Groups vs. Studying Alone: What Works Better?,"# Why Studying in Groups is a Game-Changer

So, let‚Äôs dive into why studying in groups can be such a fantastic experience:

**1. Different Perspectives:**¬†You know how sometimes you just don‚Äôt get something no matter how many times you read it? In a group, someone else might have a totally different take that clicks for you.

I remember struggling with a concept in my Equity and Trust Law class, and when I told one of my friends, she not only explained it using a real-life example that made everything click but also showed me the sources and cases to read to help me better understand it so that I could solve it well if I encountered a similar question on the exam.

So, trust me when I say you need a study buddy too! And as they say, no man is an island, right?

**2. Accountability:**¬†When you‚Äôre in a group, you can‚Äôt just zone out and scroll through your phone. Everyone‚Äôs counting on you to show up and contribute. This accountability gives you that little push to stay focused.

**3. Problem-Solving Together:**¬†If you‚Äôre stuck on a tough problem, there‚Äôs nothing like a group brainstorming session.

We would put our heads together and come up with solutions that none of us would have thought of alone. It was like magic!

**4. Making It Fun:**¬†Seriously, studying doesn‚Äôt have to feel like a chore.

My friends and I would turn our study sessions into game-like quizzes, and before we knew it, we were having a blast while learning.

I found myself looking forward to our meetings instead of dreading them.

**5. Social Connection:**¬†Studying can be isolating, especially during intense study periods. But when you‚Äôre with friends, it becomes a social event.

# But Don‚Äôt Sleep on Solo Studying

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the flip side. Studying alone has its perks too, and I can‚Äôt deny that I enjoy it sometimes:

**1. Total Focus:**¬†When I study by myself, I can create my own little bubble of concentration.

No distractions, just me and my books. It‚Äôs like having my own peaceful oasis where I can dive deep into my studies.

**2. Pacing It My Way:**¬†Sometimes I like to go slow and really absorb the information.

Studying alone sometimes allows me to set my own rhythm. If I need to reread a section, I can do that without feeling rushed.

**3. Flexibility:**¬†Life gets busy, and studying alone means I can fit it into my schedule whenever it suits me. Late night study sessions? No problem. Early morning coffee-fueled cramming? I‚Äôm in!

**4. Personal Growth:**¬†There‚Äôs something rewarding about mastering a topic on your own.

It builds your confidence and helps you feel capable of tackling any challenge. I love that sense of accomplishment.

# Finding Your Sweet Spot

For me, the magic lies in balancing both group and solo studying.

On one hand, the camaraderie and support of a group lightens the load, and on the other, solo studying lets me go at my own pace and really dig deep.

I mix it up based on my mood and what I need to focus on.

These days, I still enjoy gathering with my friends for study sessions, but I also carve out time for my solo studies. It‚Äôs like having the best of both worlds!

So, what about you? Are you more of a group study person or do you thrive on your own?

There‚Äôs no right or wrong answer‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääjust find what works for you and run with it!

Embrace both methods, and you‚Äôll likely discover a study routine that not only helps you ace your exams but also keeps your spirit high throughout your academic journey.

Happy studying!

This lady, Carolyn, has a lot of fabulous, keto and diabetic friendly recipes on her website.  I use tons of stuff from her, and I'm pretty sure it was one of her dessert baking cookbooks I purchased last year.

  
I just copied this form her website, so it has some affiliate links embedded.  I'll not changes I make in parentheses.

One big difference, is sweetener.  I use one called PureCane, which is made from fermented bamboo, and has the same sweetener as what is found in Stevia, without the bitter aftertaste.  I don't know what I'm going to do, because they went out of business a year or two ago.  I spent a bunch of money and stocked up on their products, but as I run out, I'm going to have to start looking for replacements....

Also, I like adding instant coffee to the crust and filling, because a like that hint of flavor.  I use Nescafe gold espresso powder I think it is.

  
Also, if you go to the website itself, and look at the number of servings in the recipe and click on it.  It will bring up a slider bar so that you can change the number of servings and scale the recipe up or down!  I had no idea of this until recently, and now I scale it down and make myself a smaller pie, as I'm the only one that really eats it in my house.

  
Recipe:

# Ingredients

# Crust

* 1 ¬º¬†cup¬†[almond flour](https://amzn.to/2uhAOgQ)  
* ¬º¬†cup¬†[cocoa powder](https://amzn.to/2GiAILl)
* ¬º¬†cup¬†[powdered Swerve Sweetener](https://amzn.to/2VJ2t4S)  ( use about 1/4 cup of Purecane powdered sweetener)
* ¬º¬†teaspoon¬†salt
* ¬º¬†cup¬†butter¬†melted
* (I add a nice tablespoon of instant coffee to the crust)

# Chocolate Mousse

* 4¬†ounces¬†[unsweetened chocolate](https://amzn.to/2PSM5e5)¬†chopped (I used unsweetened chocolate chips)
* 1¬†tablespoon¬†butter
* 4¬†large¬†egg whites
* ¬Ω¬†cup¬†[powdered Swerve Sweetener](https://amzn.to/2VJ2t4S)¬†divided (I used about 1/4 cup of Purecane Powdered)
* ¬º¬†cup¬†[BochaSweet](https://amzn.to/30VThfP) (I didn't use this at all)
* ¬º¬†teaspoon¬†[cream of tartar](https://amzn.to/2pDWpew)
* ‚Öõ¬†teaspoon¬†salt
* 1 ¬Ω¬†cup¬†heavy whipping cream
* ¬Ω¬†teaspoon¬†[vanilla extract](https://amzn.to/3gs1CPM)
* ¬Ω¬†teaspoon¬†[espresso powder](https://amzn.to/2EBfVgk)¬†(optional, enhances chocolate flavor) (I use a hearty, overflowing tablespoon, sometimes two!)

# Topping  (I've never made the topping, though it seems easy enough, I prefer my chocolate pie without)

* ¬Ω¬†cup¬†heavy whipping cream
* 2¬†tablespoon¬†[powdered Swerve Sweetener](https://amzn.to/2VJ2t4S)

# Instructions

# Crust

* Preheat the oven to 325F and lightly grease a 9-inch ceramic or glass tart pan.
* In a medium bowl, whisk together the almond flour, cocoa powder, sweetener, and salt. Stir in the melted butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
* Press firmly and evenly into the bottom and up the sides of the pan (if your pan is deep dish, take the crust to about 1 inch from the top). Crimp the edges decoratively as desired.
* Bake 12 minutes, then remove and let cool completely.

# Chocolate Mousse

* In a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water, melt the chocolate and butter together, stirring until smooth. Set aside to cool.
* In the bowl of a stand mixer or another large heatproof bowl, combine the egg whites, ¬º cup of the powdered Swerve, and the BochaSweet. Set over the same pan of simmering water and whisk continuously until the whites reach 160F on an instant read thermometer.
* Transfer the bowl to a stand mixer (or use a hand mixer). Add the cream of tartar and the salt and beat on high until stiff peaks form.
* In another large bowl, beat the whipping cream with the remaining ¬º cup of powdered Swerve, the vanilla, and the espresso powder, if using.
* Fold about ‚Öì of the egg whites into the chocolate to lighten it, then fold the chocolate mixture carefully back into the egg whites. Genly fold in the whipped cream until no streaks remain.
* Spread the mixture into the cooled crust, mounding toward the center. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to overnight. If overnight, press plastic wrap gently over the surface of the pie.

# Topping

* In a large bowl, combine the cream and powdered Swerve. Beat until stiff peaks form. Spread over the top of the pie before serving.

He took the antibiotics and noticed no difference though he did not eat low fodmap dueimg the antibiotics or really after. About 6 months later we got a repeat sibo test and his hydrogen levels peaked higher than before and methane was still high but lower than the first test. At this point he was pretty tired of having symptoms so said he was serious with cutting out sugar and gluten. We went to taking herbals. While on herbals and really limiting sugar and gluten he started to notice symptoms relief. But he started to fall back into eating sugar and eating gluten. He is now back to exactly how he felt before the herbals. Constant burping, bloating, some nausea, and slight constipation. We don't eat bad. We are garlic and onion free due to we believe an intolerance, I cook most of our meals and cook gluten free. So he is only having some gluten and desserts 1-3x a week when he is on his own. Example last week he had a breakfast sandwich and one cheesecake piece at work and every morning he has a coffee with half and half. Could these small amount of things at this point be causing such huge amount of symptoms and hindering him from getting to a successful point? Can we not do any gluten and sugar at all while getting rid of sibo or are we missing something? He is taking HCL (doesn't even get heartburn at 4 pills) so he is taking 3 a meal because we weren't sure how many we can go up to a meal but he takes it inconsistently due to forgetting. So usually only 1-2 meals out of 3 a day. Please explain how serious he needs to be so I can maybe show him some encouragement and what other people have said.

The more I try to understand life and the world the more I feel completely confused about both of them. One minuets you feel on top of the world and the next you feel like you are completely lost and walking down a hallway trying to get to the exit ten yards away from you but it keeps moving farther and farther down the hall with each step you take and you feel like a hamster on a hamster wheel chasing a piece of cheese tied to a stick. This year was the worst year I‚Äôve had in my entire life I keep thinking back to May 3rd, 2024 where me and C are getting ready at 7am to go to her obgyn appointment. The morning started off so fucking weird. I see a wasp above our window next to her makeup dresser that I have to get. I walk into our patio to grab a bottle of water and the planter shakes and out comes a bat or bird flying as fast as it could to get away from me. On our way to get coffee I see a man oddly waving to every car and we are giving each other the ‚Äúwtf is happening this morning‚Äù look, but shrug it off. We are driving down rt.230 passing souper river park and I‚Äôm thinking to myself how beautiful the day is and how beautiful the lake looks with sun shining on and birds flying around the lake which I run around during these hot summer days. Our baby girls gender reveal is the next day but you are a man who doesn‚Äôt like secrets so when the doctor calls you a couple days prior with her blood test results and something popped up you had to know the gender. You‚Äôre thinking about about all the things you need to pick up today after the obgyn routine appointment. Park the car coffee in my hand because I don‚Äôt usually wake up that early due to night shift work, helping her out of the car and we are so excited to see our second ultrasound of our baby. My friend K let us borrow her heartbeat monitor to listen to babies heartbeat which we were listening to every single night. Our babygirl put a fire or and light in both of our lives especially after the grueling summer with both previously had. We get up to the third floor, see all of the workers cheery and happy, check in to the room and start talking to our doctor. She explains a little more about Turner‚Äôs syndrome which was found in C‚Äôs bloodwork but being the optimistic type your brush it off because you listen to the heartbeat every night, and Jessica alba has TS so you assume that she will be just as beautiful as her when she grows up. She brings in the ultrasound machine, the doctors face went from happy to serious. You could tell it is not what she wanted to have happen first thing in the morning. My whole world shattered in a matter of milliseconds. My dreams once again shattered to little pieces. It was the type of feeling I felt once before when I was a little child sitting on the toilet thinking about the darkness and nothingness you feel when you are going to die. Sitting there as a child crying, the hyperventilating kind of cry, trying to grasp the big question of what happens when you die, and why do we even live if we just die. In comes the second doctor to verify the missed miscarriage. I felt helpless, shocked, sick to my stomach, an out of body experience. After a couple minuetes of trying to gather ourselves to walk out of the room, I almost couldn‚Äôt walk out of, when I walked past the workers there mood was different. They were quiet all work or typing, the mood in the office has shifted you could here a pin drop on there carpet hallway floors. The lake were you have to now break the news to our families and you speak to them alone in the by the lake benches because C couldn‚Äôt speak and still in shock. Telling them to call off the gender reveal, hearing both families cry two seperate times on the phone while watching rowers row by the lake you used to love to run in. All of the plans for the week suddenly in an instant are gone. Life as you know it, the innocence of it which was already slipping away, completely out the window at this point. You think about why bad shit happens to you constantly over and over and over again. The more your sit there as the seconds fly by, the more it feels like a roller coaster that you are in the middle of and wishing you can get off but can‚Äôt because you are locked in. May 3rd changed me, mayb4th was supposed to be a celebration. I wanted it start wars theme so bad because of ‚ÄúMay the 4th be with you‚Äù, but it got shot down by the boss. So instead I got our babygirl Mia a Mandlorian Grogu bin set to wear while I feed her and we binge watch the seasons together, after I take her to my jujitsu classes with me to let mom have a rest. My little buddy, my little best friend, gone before I could even hold her and kiss her. 
But I need to be strong for her, be strong for the second baby we miscarried two month after the first one, be strong for C and be strong for me. As I feel I don‚Äôt understand why horrible things happen to me or C. I just hope that there is a god up above testing me, making it so when the good things happen they feel amazing. There is not one day or one thing that I can remember as vividly as May 3rd, 2024. Just that day stuck in replay over and over again.

The thing is he has a lot of friends in our class and he is literally ALWAYS with a friend. Like I wanted to go up to him between classes or something but I thought it would be hella awkward to just go up to him while he‚Äôs talking w someone. 

It‚Äôs been a couple weeks since then so if I ever do go up to him I‚Äôd probably just ask something like ‚Äúwhat did u get on the test?‚Äù or compliment him, but I have to hurry bc our 2 week winter break is soon and I‚Äôd like to get his number before then.

So anyway, should I just go up to him while he‚Äôs with his friends or should I wait until he‚Äôs not with anyone.

(I should add that I don‚Äôt really know him or his friends‚Ä¶like at all. I just thought he was cute)",3,1734439817.0,askteenboys,7,1.0,False

It is located quite central to everything I'd need and seemed perfect with a low rent price. After moving in I noticed quite a few bangs and knocks while my partner isn't visiting and at first I put it down to being a nervous woman living alone for the first time. Over time my pagan friend has visited a lot and feels a very strong connection in my hall which I put down to just my family members that tend to appear in my space from time to time as if they are checking up on me. I later found that the flat across from me had an incident with a woman who suddenly passed after being found severely injured almost 3 years ago in January. This had explained the feeling of being watched as I go up the stairs towards my flat floor as there is only 2 spaces on that floor( I put this down to just an inquisitive spirit curious who is coming to and from their home), however over time I noticed that the knocks and bangs began to get more violent and felt like they were trying to mess with me. At first I put this down to noisy neighbours being annoying and ignored it. Then my kitchen cabinet that was held on to the wall came off the wall and smashed all my plates and glasses it contained just after I stepped away from it with my morning coffee. Since then there has been a feeling of anxiousness in my hallway inside the flat and it feels like a violent spirit is inhabiting the space as all the knocks are on my front door and the attic entrance which is just outside my bedroom door. Since then my pagan friend has come up with the theory that the woman that lived across the hall who was murdered by her abusive partner who was never convicted wandered into my home one day as I am a woman living alone like her and she was intrigued and unfortunately got trapped by the protective crystals I keep at my door and since she has become violent to gain my attention as I have ignored her subtle knocks and moving my objects and turning sockets off in the house. This is beginning to worry me as I have since cleansed the property with insense to get her out but now I feel she dwells outside my front door and there is the most awful feeling that both my partner and I get while going up and down the steps. I am unsure of what to do now as last night my partner had a horrible experience of feeling chased out the flat block after he dropped me off and I am worried this will only get worse over time. I'd really like to help this woman move forward and find peace but I worry she is an angry spirit now due to my lack of knowledge in the spiritual field I really am out of my depth as I only do cleansing in my home and use protection crystals. How can I help this soul move on or at least be at peace with herself?",2,1734439750.0,Mediums,0,1.0,False

20 episodes. MangoTV. Filming wrapped up on September 2, 2024.

The production team dropped a release date a few hours ago. They also dropped a series of new posters over the past day. A few of them are of Macau. The drama reached 1 million reservations (see last poster).

[Synopsis from MDL](https://mydramalist.com/767927-can-lan-de-feng-he-hai):

Mai You Ge came to Macau for a pre-marriage trip. The uncertainty of her future life and sudden work arrangements made her feel anxious. She met Xu Jun Le, who ran an old store but had a movie dream. Xu Jun Le's completely different attitude towards life allowed Mai You Ge to regain her inner order.

At the same time, driver Zhou Jun Hao came to Macau as a contestant in the Macau Grand Prix warm-up exhibition match and unexpectedly met Macau female security police officer Chen Jia Hui, and the two began a wonderful relationship.

Wu Kai Tong was invited by a Macau hotel to return to China to serve as the deputy manager of the public relations department, but she started a ""match of wits and courage"" with a mysterious guest who was only 7 years old. Because of this special relationship, they each opened up the knot with their families.

After their divorce, Xu Jian Ming and Tang Wei each concealed their dissatisfaction with the past. They reunited in Macau to attend their daughter's wedding and found that even though they had not seen each other for ten years, they had not forgotten everything about each other.

1hg9ug2,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentFocus/comments/1hg9ug2/top_6_productivity_hacks_for_college_students/,Top 6 Productivity Hacks for College Students,"# ¬†Use the Pomodoro Technique

This popular technique can work for anyone who wants to maximize their productivity by turning tasks into a sort of game with short spurts of focused time. The strategy is named after the kitchen timer shaped like a tomato (*pomodoro*¬†in Italian) that its developer, Francesco Cirillo, used to help him complete his work.

The time-management tool includes these steps:

* Set a timer for 25 minutes and focus on one task.
* When the ‚Äúpomodoro‚Äù (25-minute work session) ends, mark a check next to the task on a piece of paper.
* Take a five-minute break, then continue that task or start a new one.
* After four pomodoros, take a longer 15-to-30-minute break.

If any tasks require more than four 25-minute chunks of time, they should be divided into smaller, actionable steps. Any tasks that can be completed in less than 25 minutes ‚Äî such as paying rent or making a doctor‚Äôs appointment ‚Äî should be grouped together.

With this method, it‚Äôs also important to track your distractions and interruptions and come up with ways to avoid them in the future.

# ¬†Make a Manageable To-Do List

Many people feel overwhelmed or lose motivation to complete tasks when their to-do lists are excessively long. This is why it‚Äôs best to limit yourself to 3-5 tasks you can complete daily.

It‚Äôs also important that you understand the difference between tasks and goals. A task is something that can be completed within a day, such as reviewing lecture notes for an English class or going grocery shopping. A goal is bigger and usually more time-consuming, like¬†learning a language¬†or buying a new car.

# ¬†Switch Up Your Study Environment

It‚Äôs easy to become a creature of habit as a college student, with scheduled classes keeping you tied to a set routine. While this can feel comfortable, sometimes our brains and bodies need a change of scenery.

Some people enjoy studying in quiet spaces without a lot of noise and distractions, while others thrive off constant sound and interaction. It‚Äôs critical that you¬†find a study environment¬†that helps you stay on task.

While at school or home, you can try switching up your location, such as trying the living room or patio. Other campus spots, such as a quiet space outdoors or the library, can work as well. If you‚Äôre in a metropolitan area, you likely have access to various coffee shops with Wi-Fi.

And remember: No matter your surroundings, the right lighting is critical to sustaining productivity.

# ¬†Do the Hardest Tasks During Your Peak Performance Time

To harness optimal productivity, you need to determine when you‚Äôre most productive ‚Äî is it the morning, midafternoon, evening, or late at night?

To determine your peak performance time, ask yourself: When do you have the¬†greatest amount of energy¬†and concentration and feel your most creative? Your peak performance is also the time when you have the fewest distractions.

It‚Äôs essential that you complete your most demanding tasks during your highest points of energy. For example, if you know you‚Äôre not the best at math and have a big exam coming up, you should study during your peak performance time to help you stay motivated and attentive.

# ¬†Stop Browsing Websites as You Study

For many students, the biggest time distraction and productivity killer is casual website browsing. We‚Äôve all been there ‚Äî in the midst of studying, we spot a news article or a tweet that leads to another. Before long, an hour has been wasted away from the task at hand.

Research shows that the average person¬†spends over two hours on social media¬†each day.

# ¬†Limit Decision Fatigue

As a student, you may be experiencing an increased amount of decision fatigue ‚Äî for example, fretting about what classes to take or whether you should get involved in extracurriculars.

Decision fatigue happens when people are inundated with too many choices on too many subjects, to the point that making an educated or logical decision feels nearly impossible. This can lead to fatigue, avoiding the issue altogether, or overthinking to the point that you can‚Äôt make a decision.

Here are some ways you can limit decision fatigue:

* **Decrease Your Options**: This is why people meal prep ‚Äî narrowing what‚Äôs available means fewer choices. Consider a similar approach when it comes to deciding what to wear. By adopting a more uniform approach to your wardrobe and limiting the possibilities, you‚Äôll save both time and stress.
* **Set a Time Limit**: By assigning a time period, you‚Äôve got a deadline to work with. If it‚Äôs 15 minutes, for example, then set a timer for 15 minutes. When that timer goes off, the decision needs to be made.
* **Make Important Decisions During Your Peak Performance Hours**: You shouldn‚Äôt make any decisions when you‚Äôre tired or feeling a lack of creativity. This can make you even more exhausted and less likely to make a logical choice.",1,1734439558.0,StudentFocus,0,1.0,False

I hope my review helps.  
  
From April 2023 0 -> B2 Dec 2024 while working a full time job and having a life  
  
My partner is native and his family speaks only German, so I am in for a treat every coffee and dinner, so you understand my motivation is intertwined with desperation, I am also looking for a job here in Germany after immigrating from my Eastern European home and quitting my job and confort zone in the name of love.  
  
My journey with Lingoda started in April 2023, I started with a Sprint, my advice: it's only worth it if you have the the certainty you can attend every f day.  
  
Lingoda, itself, it's a great platform with very good teachers, serious classmates and thorough rules that kind of ""motivate"" you to stay disciplined.  
  
What I wished I knew as a beginner in Apr 2024:  
  
Orientation class is a waste of your credit because it basically just presents the platform, DM me and I will send you a summary of what happens there and save your actual learning credit.  
If you like a teacher, you can go to the that teachers board and book their classes, I swear having a class with a teacher I liked made the biggest difference.(My German recommendations: Agnieska, Ozlem, Julia, Branislav, etc).  
\*hint: book from ahead of time and aim to have classes as early in the morning as possible since that s when you have the chances of being just you and the teacher or just 2 people and the teacher = more speaking time, basically a 1o1 class on sale.  
  
3. Prepare for every class with the vocabulary and do the homework or exercises proposed as homework in the previous class.  
  
4. Try to stay as chronological as possible with the classes because the level between Chapter 1-2-3 vs 11-12 is very different and it just smooths your learning curve.  
  
5. You only need to do 45 classes/50 to get the certificate, my advice is to skip first orientation and some of the starting communication classes( even if you skip them you can book the class, download the material and cancel immediately using the 30 min after book free cancellation policy). NEVER skip in GRAMMAR classes because in my opinion are the most important.  
  
As a comparison to Babbel Live, Lingoda offers more, the certificate is recognized and Lingoda has for B1 135 classes offer, while Babbel has only 36, focusing mainly on speaking.  
  
If you are thinking about trying out Lingoda here is my referral link: [https://referral.lingoda.com/6Dr9Cv](https://referral.lingoda.com/6Dr9Cv)  
  
I dig monthly for discounts because I am a cheap as that can't pay full price so I got most of the months 20-30% discounts on plans for 20-40 classes so the price/class stayed in 7-8 eur range which is cheaper than a class in my home country.  
  
No hidden truth: you get paid for recommending Lingoda, but what I would offer you is a free 30 mins presentation from my account of their possibilities and my honest B1.2 from 0 feedback after many errors I wish I knew better.",1,1734439250.0,2025,0,1.0,False

Here is the tea. I (25F) and my husband (28M) have been married for three years, and he's been with me throughout the entire situation. This will be a long one, **so buckle up.**  
Whenever my husband and I first got together, he got me out of a situation with my mother, which is for another post, and two weeks after, I told him the backstory about who I now refer to as my (swimmer donor), If you know you know. I was 22 when we got together and my daughter was 2 years old, I was also currently dealing with a CPS case that has now evolved into shared custody with the foster parents (Also going bad will get into that in another post as well but is relevant to the story.)

My swimmer donor was very abusive, from the time I was 5 until the time I was 17, a weighty topic but, he's now in jail for 90 years for 103 first-degree felony Gross Giggity-Goo imposition and 2 counts of the big R word. He made the newspaper. Around 3 months before me and my husband got together he was arrested at a friend's house where he had tried to live with me and my friend,  I ran as fast as I could to an ex's house who is still a friend.

A little context for this situation before the 2 counts even happened, I warned my stepmother at 18 stating ""Please watch him around children, if he will do it to me he will likely do it to your children."" I have high-functioning autism, and he used that to his advantage to say I was lying, as well as to groom me.  When he got arrested I went into a full-blown PTSD attack stating I wanted nothing to do with the situation and that I tried to warn them, I left in the middle of the night.

around 22 he finally had the court case, we had just moved into a 3-bedroom house and I was currently working with a company that worked for a local grocery store, and helped with online orders/points. I was a supervisor, the court date looming over me and the day of I slept the entire day. My body made me sleep the entire day which is something that happens to me that my body does to protect my sanity. I explained to my boss what happened and he said that he understood and to take a couple of days off. Previously my grandmother wanted me to stand up for my swimmer donor in court and lie to the court stating that he didn't do the things that he did.

I just told her, okay, not giving her a definitive answer and leaving it at that. After the court date around 3 days later, she got ahold of my phone number while I was at work. She began to scream at me saying ""You know your dad didn't do that! Why wouldn't you stand up for him?! You're out of the will you little b\*\*\*!!"" I cursed back stating ""You obviously didn't care before when dad came to you about your dad doing the same (shitake mushrooms), why should I care what happens to him? He got what he deserved, and he did the same to me. I hope you rot in (h-e- double hockey sticks) for standing up for a disgusting son."" (didn't say disgusting but said the Big R word with a -ist at the end.)

Afterward, during the CPS case, they tried to use the fact that my swimmer donor had done the stuff to me and tried to say I did it to my daughter. The judge presiding over the case shut it down and stated that even though she's known me since 15 if there is no consecutive proof then they don't have a snowball chance in (h-e-double hockey sticks)to state I would do something like that to her.

I have since gone No Contact with this woman and she tries to constantly rub it in my face that I will not get a single one of her properties(She owns 6 rental properties, 100 acres of land, and a 300k house. which is currently getting destroyed just like it was when I first came out at 15 and she stood up for him {Not my fault the holler just decided to do this because they hate her}.) , but the poetic justice in all of this is since my swimmer donor is serving a life sentence in prison, half of the properties that she has gone to my swimmer donor is going to go to next of kin, which is either me or my husband.

She also stated that I would never be successful in life, but I'm currently in college for an associate degree and currently have my State license as a Medicaid nurse Aide (suck it grandmother lol).

AITA for going No Contact with her after she wanted me to stand up for my swimmer donor?

I was considering staying in Venice for maybe 3 nights, as I get the impression it's incredibly photogenic once it gets dark. 

I've been reading mixed feedback regarding food in Venice (overpriced and not as nice as elsewhere) - is there anything in particular I can look out for to not spend way too much money on food while staying here in particular?

Also I'll definitely want to just sit down and relax, maybe edit some photos, what kind of place would be most appropriate? I'd usually think a cafe, but also I got the impression the coffee drinking culture is a bit different in Italy than what I'm used to. 

I'm also considering doing shorter day trips to close towns/cities that look  lovely - Padua, Vicenza and Treviso maybe? They seem to be easy to reach via public transport and I'd stay the night in each. Any strong feelings regarding any of these?

As many of you might be struggling with Language learning, I am also trying my best to conquer this Kraken called ""Deutsch"".  
  
I hope my review helps.  
  
From April 2023 0 -> B2 Dec 2024 while working a full time job and having a life  
  
My partner is native and his family speaks only German, so I am in for a treat every coffee and dinner, so you understand my motivation is intertwined with desperation, I am also looking for a job here in Germany after immigrating from my Eastern European home and quitting my job and confort zone in the name of love.  
  
My journey with Lingoda started in April 2023, I started with a Sprint, my advice: it's only worth it if you have the the certainty you can attend every f day.  
  
Lingoda, itself, it's a great platform with very good teachers, serious classmates and thorough rules that kind of ""motivate"" you to stay disciplined.  
  
What I wished I knew as a beginner in Apr 2024:  
  
Orientation class is a waste of your credit because it basically just presents the platform, DM me and I will send you a summary of what happens there and save your actual learning credit.  
If you like a teacher, you can go to the that teachers board and book their classes, I swear having a class with a teacher I liked made the biggest difference.(My German recommendations: Agnieska, Ozlem, Julia, Branislav, etc).  
\*hint: book from ahead of time and aim to have classes as early in the morning as possible since that s when you have the chances of being just you and the teacher or just 2 people and the teacher = more speaking time, basically a 1o1 class on sale.  
  
3. Prepare for every class with the vocabulary and do the homework or exercises proposed as homework in the previous class.  
  
4. Try to stay as chronological as possible with the classes because the level between Chapter 1-2-3 vs 11-12 is very different and it just smooths your learning curve.  
  
5. You only need to do 45 classes/50 to get the certificate, my advice is to skip first orientation and some of the starting communication classes( even if you skip them you can book the class, download the material and cancel immediately using the 30 min after book free cancellation policy). NEVER skip in GRAMMAR classes because in my opinion are the most important.  
  
As a comparison to Babbel Live, Lingoda offers more, the certificate is recognized and Lingoda has for B1 135 classes offer, while Babbel has only 36, focusing mainly on speaking.  
  
If you are thinking about trying out Lingoda here is my referral link: [https://referral.lingoda.com/6Dr9Cv](https://referral.lingoda.com/6Dr9Cv)  
  
I dig monthly for discounts because I am a cheap as that can't pay full price so I got most of the months 20-30% discounts on plans for 20-40 classes so the price/class stayed in 7-8 eur range which is cheaper than a class in my home country.  
  
No hidden truth: you get paid for recommending Lingoda, but what I would offer you is a free 30 mins presentation from my account of their possibilities and my honest B1.2 from 0 feedback after many errors I wish I knew better.",1,1734438409.0,Manifestationmoney,0,1.0,False

1hg9iig,https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderDrones_Fanfics/comments/1hg9iig/parabellum_chapter_iv_the_god_that_failed/,"Parabellum, Chapter IV: The God That Failed","Jade‚Äôs fingers hovered over her keyboard, frozen in place as if they had been put in casts. But they were not broken. Just mere seconds ago, an idea she was sure would‚Äôve been an ingenious one had streaked across her mind only to promptly vanish like seawater foam on sand. Her gaze wandered from the many programming windows‚Äîeverything from bitcoin mining softwares, camera footage that covered nearly the whole of the First Hill area, fund monitoring from the various bookmakers that had been fitted into one window, all crowding her monitor‚Äîto the overturned bottle of pills. She could just make out the name wrapped around the front of the bottle, though the bottle was face down:¬†*ROSSI, JADE.*¬†They were prescribed by her therapist, who, for all he knew, was prescribing it to a humble, yet talented IT technician. He knew not that he was speaking to¬†**LLORONA**¬†three days per week, the alias of one of the Rossi Family‚Äôs¬†*best*¬†and most notorious hacker‚Äîthe alias she went by for years. The media didn‚Äôt know the Family to be associated with Rossi, rather they were known as ‚ÄúThe Faceless Mob‚Äù, mainly due to the scratchy, often static-lined dark helmets they wore. Nobody knew their leader, nobody knew their enforcers or their¬†*caporegimes‚Äô*¬†identity‚Äîthe masks came with an intricate jamming software and voice distorter that prevented any penetration, and subsequent recognition‚Äîmuch unlike the other mobs, and nobody made an effort to find their leader. With the exception of Oliver Mackenzie. Now he was in a police morgue because of it, not to mention eyeless. Jade still struggled to wrap her head around that fact‚Äîa part of her didn't want to believe Uzi was capable of doing something like that. She was originally detached, if not prideful of the act the college girl had carried out, but now‚Ä¶ Jade couldn't quite place the feeling. It wasn‚Äôt beyond most of the things she‚Äôd seen‚Äîit didn‚Äôt even make it to the top one-hundred, but just knowing it came from¬†*her‚Ä¶*¬†She had seen the aloof statements by Seattle police chief Tyler McKinley and the doubling of police efforts around the city, which only soothed about a quarter of Seattle‚Äôs population. It was surprising that the younger drone hadn‚Äôt gotten any sort of reprimand for her actions‚Äîyet, Jade groused. But at the same time, a twisted sense of pride curled within her chest, slithering around like a cobra and brushing against every bone in her ribcage.

¬†¬†¬†The Rossi Mob was the polar, unrecognizable opposite of the Hollywood rendition of the Sicilian Mafia, that was made certain now more than ever.¬† That perturbed the press out of investigating further; for now. They‚Äôd probably end up being confused for the Illuminati if any of them were ever found out, Jade observed. To the public, Aurelio Rossi was a charismatic philanthropic titan and advocate for drones‚Äô rights, not the¬†*mafioso*¬†responsible for innumerable deaths. A man that has built the first apartment complex with elevators and areas meant for¬†*both*¬†species, and spearheaded progression‚Äîa man who always warmly smiled for the cameras. The only people who¬†*knew*¬†were the Arroyos, but they couldn't act on it. His fame rendered him untouchable. Jade involuntarily shuddered. She had almost caused that war because she wasn‚Äôt careful enough. Then she just¬†*had*¬†to get rough with the¬†*Kurotaka-kai*. Just¬†*had*¬†to teach a lesson to one of them. The bastard had a quick mouth anyway, Jade rationalized. She hated smartasses that weren‚Äôt Family. Jade wasn‚Äôt exactly one to be browbeaten without a fight‚Äîwith some exceptions. She would very much like to keep her head on her shoulders for the foreseeable future, even if it was an undesirable one. But a side of her told her maybe she had gone too far. Then the feeling left before it truly registered, replaced with a sinking emptiness that prickled her casing like the chilled November winds outside. A barren, desolate emptiness as vacant and uninhabited as the Mideast‚Äôs many deserts. As dull as an old black-and-white movie, but it carried none of the old charm. She found herself wanting to shoot up from her chair, pace about her house‚Äîup and down the stairs, brush her hand on the walnut railing in an attempt to feel¬†*anything*¬†besides the freezing air that had begun to seep in from the cracks in the upstairs windows and concentrate into her palms and legs. But the drone remained glued to her seat.

¬†¬†¬†She‚Äôd make an exception for the Family. She really had no choice, anyway. Dante Rossi consummately for his age negotiated the Family out of a potential war with the feared Seattle Yakuza due to the man dying in the hospital, so severe was the buffeting he had received (nobody really interfered, the man was not much liked even by his so-called ‚Äúfriends‚Äù) in the form of small concessions in the tech business‚Äînot enough to gain a foothold to challenge their dominance in that field, but just enough to satisfy the Yakuza. Jade was lucky she still kept the position of lead hacker in the area of First Hill. She had always liked the rugged scenery, and Jade was far too valuable to lose that position. Dante‚Äôs diplomatic prowess was enviable, truly a man worthy of the title of¬†*consigliori*. There was a low droning noise in the back of her mind, as if it was coming from right behind her‚Äîbut when she'd turn around, the noise stopped. The dark edges around her vision swirled and crinkled. Did she get enough sleep last night? Hell if she knew.

¬†¬†¬†Then the pill bottle began to speak to her. It didn't move, nor did it grow any comical appendage that vanished when she blinked. That was a first. ‚ÄúTake one,‚Äù It was the voice of her therapist‚Äîsmooth, calm, and as well-meaning as ever. It reverberated throughout her skull, but she didn't move. ‚ÄúTake one,‚Äù it repeated. Its voice was now much lower. A single image smeared itself on her vision like plaster. It replaced the programming windows. An overturned couch in a living room, but all the other furniture was clean and upright. The TV to the left was off, reflecting a bright light to the far left, and the entrance hall light was on‚Äîa buzzing, off-amber light that came as splotches rather than a concentrated beam. The rest of the room was tidy, and alien, but strangely familiar. The two other pieces of furniture were upright, but the couch in the middle was overturned. What was this? Had she lived there? When? A horrible sense of¬†*d√©j√† vu*¬†overcame her. Anything beyond the hall was shrouded in darkness, despite the light. In the distance, the glass table in front of the entrance mirror was half-shrouded in darkness. It fragmented, and distorted, slowly devolving into only a hazy, deep-brown light that was nauseating to simply look at. It looked like a compressed file, only distorted and heavily corrupted beyond any physical recognition. But yet it felt like she knew what it was anyway. ‚ÄúTake one,‚Äù once more, but this time, the voice had lost its soothing tone. Now, it was more demanding;‚Äîdesperate, even. It sounded like her, but far, far younger. Five, at the very least, she inferred. ‚ÄúEvery three hours, Jade.‚Äù¬†

¬†¬†¬†It sounded so youthful, so¬†*firm.*¬†Distant, but clear. Far away, yet right in front of her. Firm, but wavering quiet, and timid‚Äîlike a terrified child‚Äôs poor attempt at keeping their voice down while hiding away. Heavily unlike her voice now, scratchy and coarse from years of teenage smoking. Why didn't she move? Why couldn't she move? Jade became like stone, her body would not execute the order to move. Instead, she shook. Violently, at that. The smell of gunpowder invaded her chemosensory receptors, and soon it was the only thing she could smell. Or was it just the nicotine? ‚ÄúJade,‚Äù it called, now once more soothing, like a mother to her child. ‚ÄúJade,‚Äù the voice sent a dull tingle throughout her body, and bile began its burning, agonizingly slow journey up her throat. It now sounded like a police operator calming a panicking, hidden witness while the suspects wrought havoc. It was hollow, emotionless, like they were reading lines from a script rather than making any true effort to calm her down. What officer would take the time out of their days to fully commit to calming down some*thing*¬†that isn't even human? Did they even feel what they felt? Jade found herself asking that question every nightfall. Yet another question that made its residence in her mind without an answer to see it out.

¬†¬†¬†The drone wanted to scream, to shout‚Äîto tell whoever it was to¬†*stop saying her name.*¬†But the words withered to ash in her throat. Perhaps it was fear. Fear that smothered her words before they could tumble from her lips. Fear? No, she had to be fear*less*. She was the older one‚Äîjust on the sunny side of twenty-three, the very prime of her youth‚Äîshe was the role model. ‚ÄúStay calm, and¬†*don't move*,‚Äù She had to be fierce, she had to be deadly. She had to be¬†*perfect.*¬†Fearless‚Ä¶ Fearless. Why was she afraid now,¬†*what was she so afraid of?*¬†She had the protection, even the favor of one of America‚Äôs most powerful families;¬†*what was there to fear?*¬†Jade felt nothing, but everything at the same time, and the question remained unanswered‚Äîan indescribable sensation that wrapped around her being like some sort of barrier. Her trembling hands finally obeyed her orders, but instead of reaching for the pill bottle, it betrayed her once more and stretched for the half-smoked cigarette docked in the ashtray to her left, and the worn lighter beside it. Maybe this would calm her nerves anyway, she thought. Smoking had always done that for her. It was all in her mind, after all. She trapped the cigarette between her index and middle finger, grasping the lighter with her free hand. Jade brought the lighter to the cigarette, flicking once, flicking twice. Thrice, a small flame emerged, illuminating her powder white optics. The cigarette glowed, streaks of reddish-orange running across the tar black tobacco like rivers of fire. The drone inhaled, feeling the smoke burn her lungs. The voice‚Äîher voice, slowly receded, as if it wasn‚Äôt even there in the first place. The image faded, and was replaced by the various windows nearly overpopulating her monitor, still working tirelessly by automation. She plucked the cigarette from her mouth, breathing out wisps of dark gray, which was quickly followed by a sharp, dusty smoker‚Äôs cough that slightly jolted her forward in her seat. The cough was a consequence of adopting this crutch of hers, one that clung stubbornly to Jade since the moment she first smoked at sixteen like a bad smell. She knew the cigs would kill her one day‚ÄîHell, they were already doing it‚Äîbut it was great at soothing her nerves. Histrionics wasn't something she was known for, and Jade would much like to keep it that way. One of the live footage displays caught her optic.¬†

¬†¬†¬†Reporters‚ÄîJade could easily identify them and their variously sized cameras, all clamoring over each other for that perfect shot for their respective media outlets. Jade exhaled, her breath taking form as a small, short-lived cloud of dark gray. Within the swarm of media pukes that had populated one of the many alleyways near¬†*Madison*¬†*St.*, accompanied by cop cars, their respective news channel‚Äôs trucks and various news instruments‚Äîright near the Seattle Central Library, she spotted a sharp edge. A blade? She zoomed in from the distant street camera that should¬†*not*¬†have been looking their way, then back out. No, it was something else. Their cameras flashed, illuminating the dark alleyway like the flash of a muzzle. Jade leaned forward, squinting her optics. What were they taking pictures of? She couldn‚Äôt quite think of anything, mainly because her mind was still reeling from the aftereffects of‚Äîwhatever that was. Jade knew; she knew full well what it truly was, but a part of herself didn‚Äôt want to believe it. She was so young, there was no way she was losing it¬†*this early.*¬†No, it wasn't possible. It shouldn‚Äôt even be a thought at all. Twenty-three. Merely twenty-three and with‚Äî ¬†

Jade stopped herself from finishing the thought. Her stomach burned and contracted, but she kept her face a mask of neutrality with a hint of that stony, brusque gaze she had built a reputation within the Family for; a skill she had garnered from years‚Äô worth of experience. She kept herself fixated on the screen, fiercely eschewing any other thought from her mind. Or at least, trying to. Her thoughts fluttered to and fro with the pace of a pheasant unable to decide whether to trot along or take flight, before resting on one person, one of the people she loved like a sister: Viktoria. Hospital records in First Hill showed that she was currently having quite the stay in those sterile halls. She had just been admitted for attempted poisoning, the hospital report had read. A bold move, trying to take out someone so close to the Don. It was a slow-acting concoction‚Äîthe stupid bastard that had spiked her drink had slipped in expired cyanide‚Äîbut a painful one all the same that left Vik with more of an extremely resentful stomach rather than a quick death as the perp intended. ¬†

But on the bright side, Jade thought, barely managing to hold back a wry half-grin that was beginning to take form on her features, it'd probably scare her away from drinking entirely, not that she drank much at all. This incident wouldn‚Äôt make the headlines, Vince had made sure of that. If it did, it'd bring some bad media attention onto the Don and gutter Vik‚Äôs respect from friends and enemies alike, something Viktoria had painstakingly and ruthlessly built for herself‚Äînot just as a drone activist‚Äôs adopted daughter, but as an enforcer. It would suggest to the common man and inquisitive journalist that either Vicky had gotten herself entangled in the Yakuza‚Äôs web and had done something to warrant retaliation, or Rossi was hiding something deeper; and no reporter, journalist, whatever media job under the sun would pass that by‚Äîthey‚Äôd be drawn to it like a swarm of moths to a large bonfire, especially the ones from the¬†*Times*.¬†*Nosy pricks,*¬†Jade observed resentfully. Mackenzie was a reporter from the¬†*Seattle Times.*¬†About twenty-nine when he died, if the police reports she had accessed the night before were correct.¬†

¬†¬†¬†The Faceless Mob couldn‚Äôt have either possibility become reality. Vincent was still quite young, per se‚Äîjust upon the darker side of thirty-nine, crossing the horizon into forty come December‚Äîand prided himself on field work as a way to keep his prized USMC physique. But this had only consisted of throwing money at the situation (much to Andolini‚Äôs chagrin, he preferred a more‚Ä¶ physical way of handling things), something any¬†*caporegime*¬†had in spades. Jade took another drag, exhaling the moment she felt the smoke burn. The man who had poisoned her sister in all but relation was Haruto Ito, an ex-Kurotaka who had confused her for¬†**LLORONA**‚Äîwhom he had only heard about via his few remaining connections within the Kurotaka-kai‚Äîand was eager to enact retribution in spite of the fact that Jade was masked during the confrontation, most possibly a desperate method of regaining respect and possibly re-entry into the Seattle Yakuza. Now that bastard was dead too. Beaten to a bloody pulp by the Don himself, Jade recalled. She toggled a secure holographic window, scrolling through her secure read mail at lightning speeds before stopping at one, and pulling it up. Sure enough, it reported in chilling detail the death of Haruto Ito, and the denial of the¬†*Kumich≈ç*¬†having any hand in the poisoning. Repeated blunt force trauma to the head. By the time the body was found in a dumpster far away from the¬†*Imperator,*¬†he was physically unrecognizable. It was true, the¬†*Kumich≈ç*¬†didn‚Äôt greenlight it. At least Jade hoped so. She closed the window.

¬†¬†¬†In spite of her current train of thought, shattered like glass to a gunshot, a strange limbo of thinking with a relieving clarity but also a thick midnight's fog that spread its tendrils to every part of the drone‚Äôs thought process, rendering her unable to string together any complex thought‚ÄîJade was still just as sharp a mind as the shards the shattered panes it produced, even under the restrictions that were so suddenly forced upon her. While the Arroyos were knee-deep in the drug and narcotics business and predictably made millions off of it, the Kurotaka-kai handled arms of all kinds in tandem with the Russians, certainly ironic, given their respective countries‚Äô histories with each other. They were the ones who had the most cutting-edge weaponry the very microsecond it hit shelves, from rifles to the more exotic and pricey rocket launchers and machine guns, no thanks to hundreds of bots and intricate schemes that flung the arms into their hands and in the process threw any and all tails for loops abound. The Kuros, as they were appellated by much of the Family, were a deeply intriguing mix of traditionalism and stunning progressivism, two completely incompatible ideologies that were somehow kept at bay with wondrous efficiency, kept in a precious middle. It was enigmatic how they did it, a riddle whose answer bore just as much elusivity as any member of the Family. But naturally, the ancient, albeit anachronistic, Yakuza traditionalism won out on most grounds. But as a result of that, they had a tendency to take things far too personally, especially if respect is involved‚Äî*How ironic,*¬†a part of Jade pointed out with a predictable snarkiness‚Äîand thusly, things were very quick to get bloody if the Kurotakas were crossed. Bad for everyone involved, Jade curtly concluded before her thoughts turned to the equivalent of putty once more. It took forcing herself to rise from her seat, the trot down the stabbing cold walnut stairs and a whole cigarette smoked in a single sitting Jade scarcely registered for her mind to rebound just as the final curling vapors faded.¬†

¬†¬†¬†The house had fallen into a complete silence, like an audience left wordless even when the melody settled into silence. The reason why she had come down the stairs had fled from her mind, and Jade found herself awkwardly standing on the edge of the first step, tapping her finger on the darkwood railing at irregular intervals. Her relatively modest house‚Äîas modest as a¬†*scrap-fucker*¬†like her could get, which was certainly a dream home for her kind‚Äîgave an almost scenic view of the round-the-clock bustling I-5 and¬†*Madison St.*¬†that loomed over it. Jade was lucky both sights weren‚Äôt blocked off by the towering urban sprawl‚Äîtruth be told, she had half-expected that to be the case.¬† It also provided a clear view of the Pike Place Market district and the distant Marriott Waterfront. Jade would have taken numerous visits to the very pricey waterfront if the Arroyos hadn‚Äôt‚Äîin all practicality‚Äîowned the coastline of Seattle up to West Point Lighthouse and was in no mood to share any piece of it, and that it was completely inaccessible to drones. The rest of the Seattle coastline went to the Russians and Kuros, leaving the Bennelis and, consequently, the Rossi Family landlocked.¬†

¬†¬†¬†She allowed her powder white optics to drift, slowly scanning up and down the stairs in her peripheral vision even though she knew there was no danger to look out for. A common teaching Don Rossi had ingrained into not just her poor excuse for a brain was always living with caution. Caution was a¬†*mafioso‚Äôs*¬†best friend, and it had certainly saved Jade from the grave more times than she bothered to count.¬†*What did I come down here for?*¬†She wondered. Her thought process worked at the pace of an asthmatic snail. The sharpness Jade had not mere minutes ago exhibited had vanished as if she had just been reset. Something in the corner of her vision shifted, and against every instinct, reflex, and commandment years in the Family had instilled in her; she went rigid, as still and stiff as board. The only thing that moved was her arm, like it had a mind of its own. It flew to her neck, grasping at her necklace‚Äîa silver cross necklace she should‚Äôve yanked off her neck long ago, and the only memory of whoever she stayed with before‚Ä¶ Before what?¬†*The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want‚Ä¶*¬†¬† The old Psalm populated her barren and fogged mind before she could stop it. What good would it serve, when years of repeating it each night only to lay awake far past midnight was the only result it had shown? It was the reason she stopped praying when she hit seventeen. Years and years of entreaties and sinking her head into the Bible she had stuffed away in some forgotten corner of her old room for hours on end when she wasn‚Äôt out ‚Äúpersuading‚Äù business owners to pay up had amounted to naught. They had flown up to the night sky and wilted in the air. Why hadn't God taken her¬†*out*¬†of this ‚Äúlife,‚Äù as they called it? Her grip tightened on the foot of the small cross, but her shoulder only shook. For years, it had been problem after problem‚Äînot that she could remember much of it, anyway‚Äîand what had God done? Nothing, precisely nothing. Sat back in his plush, golden throne room flocked by angels, leaned back and laughed at every mistake, every fuck up, every tear Jade had blundered herself into. Why couldn‚Äôt He pull her up from the waves, like He did with Peter‚ÄîOr was it Paul? Jade couldn‚Äôt remember‚Äîspread his arms out and just say the words; those words that rendered a whole raging typhoon of a sea to a docile pond that produced not a single ripple? For all the times she had spent minutes‚Äî*eternities*‚Äîpraying, the only answer she had ever gotten was a brush of cold air. The corner of¬† Jade‚Äôs lips twitched in an attempt to form itself into a scowl.¬†*What did I do to deserve this?*¬†¬†

‚Äú***I can think of a few things,***‚Äù There was that voice again. As if it was right beside her, casually interjecting as if it could read her mind‚Äîa faint, hollow echo that sounded like it was coming from another room. It¬†*was*¬†her mind, after all. How does one keep secrets from one‚Äôs own mind? What was supposed to be a shudder only came out as a poorly controlled tremor, and her grip tightened once more on the necklace. Her body remained stock-still. The cool air that poured from somewhere in the house brushed against her casing, slithering up her light brown sweater she always wore when she was home. The moment the blades licked her skin her body lost its rigidness, and in an instant she turned on her heel and quite mindlessly trotted back up the stairs as if nothing had happened. It was a cycle Jade had learned to live with: A rush of being, then nothingness. The inability to think properly at all‚Äîmaybe for hours, maybe for a day or two‚Äîthen in a flash, it returns, accompanied by rapid-fire images ranging from every single worst-case scenario Jade‚Äôs mind had ever constructed, some as outlandish and simplistic as a child‚Äôs fear of the dark, others‚Äî ¬†

Jade shook her head with such intensity she thought her neck would snap. Her foot caught on the large triangular step marking the beginning of the short flight of stairs that led to the upstairs region of the house. The possibilities and rationalizations once again started their sprint back and forth: Had someone rigged anything? Would her next step be her last? Her throat dried, sparking a dull burn in the back that was quick to spread downward, and she froze mid-step. Questions that zoomed about like sugar-highed children played table tennis with her ability to quickly decipher them. Hadn‚Äôt she painstakingly checked and re-checked nearly the whole house just an hour before she retreated to her desk? Her mind once more flashed with warbled, flickering dreams of slamming her fist against the nearest solid surface, but her muscles only tensed up. The other choices had melted into incomprehensibility, a stream of unrelated questions and what-ifs that collided with the stifling void that rested in the pit of her stomach along with the dulled acidic burn of caffeine from the coffee she had ingested no short of a couple hours ago. The acrid phantom stench of cigarette smoke burned her chemosensory receptors‚Äîa familiar burn, one that failed to draw a cough from her dully scratching throat.¬†*Maybe someone had spiked that too,*¬†she offhandedly thought.¬†*Maybe I‚Äôll be dead in the next couple minutes.*¬†She mentally snickered like an upstart schoolgirl setting eyes on prey.¬†*Wouldn‚Äôt that be nice.*¬†Her mind attempted to scrawl up what death would be like. Perhaps it was just like the end of an old black and white movie. Maybe she‚Äôd hear the faint squealing of white noise. Maybe she‚Äôd still be there, floating and drenched in a suffocating black that kept wrapping itself around her and squeezing until she forgot she even existed before this. Perpetually drowning ‚Äòneath a lake of blackened waves and infinite depth‚Äîunable to see, hear, even scream. It was the only string of possibilities Jade didn‚Äôt bother trying to force out of her brain‚Äôs projector room. It‚Äôd be a hopeless fight anyway, much like with all of the other barbarous intrusions. The good part was that it faded away within the hour.

Her vision lost its focus, the world‚Äôs edges smudged somewhat. She blinked‚Äîonce, twice, thrice‚Äîeverything regained its definition, then drooped once again. Her field of vision hadn‚Äôt lost its sharpness this time, only it had merely lost its focus. Jade leaned on the railing, scarcely registering that she had fully climbed upstairs or the icy press of the wood. Her gaze floated down to the opaque rectangular windows parallel to the front door, trying to see through the blurred glass. Anything beyond the window looked like a hazy, vague painting splattered onto the pavement by some irresponsible oaf. A self-toggled AR window pulled itself up without as much as a¬†*ding*¬†precipitating it, nearly making the young drone noticeably jump backwards. Nearly. ¬† It was merely a¬†*Times*¬†newsletter she had forgotten to turn off auto-display on‚Äîa journalist rambling on and on about some‚Ä¶ Wait a damn minute. Jade‚Äôs gaze sharpened, and she carefully scanned the article, jumping past the ads unabashedly displaying women in barely-there dresses. Then again. And again.¬†**FBI WATCHER SHOT DOWN IN DOWNTOWN SEATTLE**, the title read in full, bold text. Her mind flashed back to that blade‚Äîin the first, and possibly last show of cooperation for this whole day‚Äîno, Watcher. That was what had been shot down? Those things were supposed to be far too quick for a bullet, Jade recalled from what she and her team had gathered. But it did have a¬†*very*¬†short break period and a predictable, pre-directed route. If what was in the article was indeed true‚Äîthough she took the news with more than an inch of salt‚Äîthen Uzi had attracted the attention of the Bureau. Fear surged through Jade‚Äôs veins.¬†*Not good. Not good.*¬†She dashed off to her room,¬† throwing on a firmly crumpled but never worn ripped denim jacket over her black long-sleeve undershirt, jeans to match, and a¬†*Superunknown*¬†baseball cap‚Äîshe had kept it ever since a then-seventeen year old Uzi had gifted her the hat and the vinyl for her twenty-first birthday after months spent saving; both of which she had taken a liking to. The hat pressed her silverish-white pigtails down, creating a dull pressure that served more to annoy than inflict pain. The purple-haired youngster would still be stuck in the academic purgatory that was the University of Seattle, Jade‚Äôs mind interjected in a rare attempt to sooth her spiked nerves. Uzi wouldn‚Äôt exactly be a¬†*prime*¬†suspect given her circumstance. After all, there were thousands of drones in Seattle to falsely accuse of this incident.¬†*Maybe it was someone else?*¬†Jade hoped with all of what remained of her soul that that was indeed the case. Jade quickly pulled up a secure messaging network directly linked to Don Rossi; the messages would be deleted within the next thirty minutes, leaving no trace behind for anyone at all. ¬†

**GUESS WHO‚ÄôS IN TOWN.**¬†She typed, quickly following it up with the link to the news article as she darted down the steps. She stopped short on the last one, planting the rim of her palm on the corner of the wall. In a second, a block of what was to the uneducated observer simply drywall folded back and slowly elevated upward, locking in place. It revealed a small, musty-smelling wooden compartment and a well taken care of¬†*M1911.*¬†Jade swiped the sleek black gun from its holding place, sticking a finger up between the inner drywall and the faux one. She clicked a button intelligently hidden between the two with the tip of her finger and quickly retracted her hand just as the block slowly came back down and locked in place. Jade had quickly learned to never leave the house without the gun, save for a few exceptions. The drone adroitly stashed the small pistol away in her inner jacket pocket‚Äîany other gun would be far too obvious, given her choice of clothing. Just enough to be an adequate shield to the November elements; but not thick enough to hide away a revolver. The lock was Jade‚Äôs own brainchild, an intricate fingerprint lock hidden away in plain sight that only used the side of her palm and played into her habit of pressing the side of her palm on the corner wall that marked the beginning of the stairwell. Habits were a fatal thing to have in ‚ÄúThe Life‚Äù‚Äîworse than any bullet or blade, but Jade kept some of them anyway, mainly due to her therapist endorsing them as a way to keep her ‚Äúgrounded.‚Äù The natural exception being her relationship with the ‚Äúcancer sticks.‚Äù She slipped into a pair of black¬†*Air Forces*, wrapping her hand around the silver knob that separated her house from her small garage. ¬† Jade pressed her body against the door, straining her auditory receptors for anything that would indicate an unwanted surprise on the other side. She had more than a significant amount of precautions for a situation like that, but one could never be too sure.¬†*Better safe than sorry,*¬†the youngster repeated as she inched the door open. Her optics squeezed shut, and she took a sharp breath. No click. No explosion that would render her a puddle of tar black paste and burnt to a crisp clothing on her wall. Only silence that seemed to stretch on until the end of time.

She exhaled heavily, and fully pulled the door open, trotting down the short three-step that led into the garage. Besides the evident stench of petrol and engine oil, a stylish navy blue 3070 Beamer sat patiently in the middle of the surprisingly clean garage. Light filtered in from the small windows atop the garage door, casting just enough of a glow to identify any bomb planted‚Äîto Jade‚Äôs relief, there was none. It didn‚Äôt stop her from stooping down and spending the better half of ten minutes checking herself, however. Just like the light had demonstrated, there were indeed no explosives lying in wait under her car. The drone straightened up, pressing her finger against the driver‚Äôs window barrier and watching the car start up. The door popped open. ‚Äú**GOOD AFTERNOON, MRS. ROSSI.**‚Äù The automated voice welcomed as Jade climbed inside. She pulled up yet another window, running streams of white colored code and punching in a string of programming and closing out the window. The moment the window was closed, the garage door flipped open with a jarring speed, and light beamed into the car. Jade squinted her eyes, pulling out of the garage despite the blinding midday sunlight and expertly pulling her car into traffic heading northward on¬†*Boren Avenue.*

1hg9i92,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTheTraveler/comments/1hg9i92/which_rim_of_the_grand_canyon_is_best/,Which rim of the Grand Canyon is best?,"Hey everyone! I just got back from an incredible adventure at the Grand Canyon South Rim, and I needed to share my experience. As someone who's lived in Vegas for years, I can't believe I waited this long to visit one of the world's most spectacular natural wonders.

I booked a day tour from Las Vegas (I'll share the link I used below - they had the best price I could find), and it turned out to be one of the best decisions I've made. The whole experience was seamless from start to finish.

The bus picked me up right from my hotel early morning. Pro tip: grab a coffee and maybe bring a small pillow - it's a long ride, but totally worth it. The bus was super comfortable with AC and a bathroom, which made the journey much more pleasant.

Our first major stop was in Kingman, Arizona, where we had a quick break. The driver/guide (shoutout to Mike!) was incredibly knowledgeable and kept us entertained with fascinating facts about the region's history and geology throughout the trip.

When we finally reached the South Rim... guys, pictures don't do it justice. At all. We visited multiple viewpoints, including Mather Point and Bright Angel Point, and each one offered a completely different perspective of the canyon. The colors, the vastness, the way the shadows play across the rocks - it's mind-blowing.

I opted for the helicopter upgrade (here's the link to book with options: https://athometouch.com/SouthRim), and let me tell you - if you can swing it, DO IT. Seeing the canyon from above gives you a whole new appreciation for its scale. It's honestly surreal.

The tour included a meal voucher which was perfect for lunch, and we also had time to check out the National Geographic Visitor Center. I skipped the IMAX movie since I wanted more time at the viewpoints, but other people in my group who watched it said it was great.

A few random tips:
- Wear comfortable shoes
- Bring a water bottle
- Don't forget sunscreen (learned this the hard way)
- Your phone camera is fine, but if you have a real camera, bring it
- Layer your clothes - temperatures can vary quite a bit

The whole experience took about 14 hours, and while it's a long day, it's absolutely doable and worth every minute. The tour I booked starts at $80, which is honestly a steal considering everything that's included.

If you're planning to go, here's the link I used: https://athometouch.com/SouthRim. They often have deals, and the booking process was super straightforward.

Feel free to ask any questions in the comments - happy to share more details about my experience!",1,1734438328.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

1hg9hnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderDrones/comments/1hg9hnw/parabellum_chapter_iv_the_god_that_failed/,"Parabellum, Chapter IV: The God That Failed","Jade‚Äôs fingers hovered over her keyboard, frozen in place as if they had been put in casts. But they were not broken. Just mere seconds ago, an idea she was sure would‚Äôve been an ingenious one had streaked across her mind only to promptly vanish like seawater foam on sand. Her gaze wandered from the many programming windows‚Äîeverything from bitcoin mining softwares, camera footage that covered nearly the whole of the First Hill area, fund monitoring from the various bookmakers that had been fitted into one window, all crowding her monitor‚Äîto the overturned bottle of pills. She could just make out the name wrapped around the front of the bottle, though the bottle was face down: *ROSSI, JADE.* They were prescribed by her therapist, who, for all he knew, was prescribing it to a humble, yet talented IT technician. He knew not that he was speaking to **LLORONA** three days per week, the alias of one of the Rossi Family‚Äôs *best* and most notorious hacker‚Äîthe alias she went by for years. The media didn‚Äôt know the Family to be associated with Rossi, rather they were known as ‚ÄúThe Faceless Mob‚Äù, mainly due to the scratchy, often static-lined dark helmets they wore. Nobody knew their leader, nobody knew their enforcers or their *caporegimes‚Äô* identity‚Äîthe masks came with an intricate jamming software and voice distorter that prevented any penetration, and subsequent recognition‚Äîmuch unlike the other mobs, and nobody made an effort to find their leader. With the exception of Oliver Mackenzie. Now he was in a police morgue because of it, not to mention eyeless. Jade still struggled to wrap her head around that fact‚Äîa part of her didn't want to believe Uzi was capable of doing something like that. She was originally detached, if not prideful of the act the college girl had carried out, but now‚Ä¶ Jade couldn't quite place the feeling. It wasn‚Äôt beyond most of the things she‚Äôd seen‚Äîit didn‚Äôt even make it to the top one-hundred, but just knowing it came from *her‚Ä¶* She had seen the aloof statements by Seattle police chief Tyler McKinley and the doubling of police efforts around the city, which only soothed about a quarter of Seattle‚Äôs population. It was surprising that the younger drone hadn‚Äôt gotten any sort of reprimand for her actions‚Äîyet, Jade groused. But at the same time, a twisted sense of pride curled within her chest, slithering around like a cobra and brushing against every bone in her ribcage.

¬†¬†¬†The Rossi Mob was the polar, unrecognizable opposite of the Hollywood rendition of the Sicilian Mafia, that was made certain now more than ever.¬† That perturbed the press out of investigating further; for now. They‚Äôd probably end up being confused for the Illuminati if any of them were ever found out, Jade observed. To the public, Aurelio Rossi was a charismatic philanthropic titan and advocate for drones‚Äô rights, not the *mafioso* responsible for innumerable deaths. A man that has built the first apartment complex with elevators and areas meant for *both* species, and spearheaded progression‚Äîa man who always warmly smiled for the cameras. The only people who *knew* were the Arroyos, but they couldn't act on it. His fame rendered him untouchable. Jade involuntarily shuddered. She had almost caused that war because she wasn‚Äôt careful enough. Then she just *had* to get rough with the *Kurotaka-kai*. Just *had* to teach a lesson to one of them. The bastard had a quick mouth anyway, Jade rationalized. She hated smartasses that weren‚Äôt Family. Jade wasn‚Äôt exactly one to be browbeaten without a fight‚Äîwith some exceptions. She would very much like to keep her head on her shoulders for the foreseeable future, even if it was an undesirable one. But a side of her told her maybe she had gone too far. Then the feeling left before it truly registered, replaced with a sinking emptiness that prickled her casing like the chilled November winds outside. A barren, desolate emptiness as vacant and uninhabited as the Mideast‚Äôs many deserts. As dull as an old black-and-white movie, but it carried none of the old charm. She found herself wanting to shoot up from her chair, pace about her house‚Äîup and down the stairs, brush her hand on the walnut railing in an attempt to feel *anything* besides the freezing air that had begun to seep in from the cracks in the upstairs windows and concentrate into her palms and legs. But the drone remained glued to her seat.

¬†¬†¬†She‚Äôd make an exception for the Family. She really had no choice, anyway. Dante Rossi consummately for his age negotiated the Family out of a potential war with the feared Seattle Yakuza due to the man dying in the hospital, so severe was the buffeting he had received (nobody really interfered, the man was not much liked even by his so-called ‚Äúfriends‚Äù) in the form of small concessions in the tech business‚Äînot enough to gain a foothold to challenge their dominance in that field, but just enough to satisfy the Yakuza. Jade was lucky she still kept the position of lead hacker in the area of First Hill. She had always liked the rugged scenery, and Jade was far too valuable to lose that position. Dante‚Äôs diplomatic prowess was enviable, truly a man worthy of the title of *consigliori*. There was a low droning noise in the back of her mind, as if it was coming from right behind her‚Äîbut when she'd turn around, the noise stopped. The dark edges around her vision swirled and crinkled. Did she get enough sleep last night? Hell if she knew.

¬†¬†¬†Then the pill bottle began to speak to her. It didn't move, nor did it grow any comical appendage that vanished when she blinked. That was a first. ‚ÄúTake one,‚Äù It was the voice of her therapist‚Äîsmooth, calm, and as well-meaning as ever. It reverberated throughout her skull, but she didn't move. ‚ÄúTake one,‚Äù it repeated. Its voice was now much lower. A single image smeared itself on her vision like plaster. It replaced the programming windows. An overturned couch in a living room, but all the other furniture was clean and upright. The TV to the left was off, reflecting a bright light to the far left, and the entrance hall light was on‚Äîa buzzing, off-amber light that came as splotches rather than a concentrated beam. The rest of the room was tidy, and alien, but strangely familiar. The two other pieces of furniture were upright, but the couch in the middle was overturned. What was this? Had she lived there? When? A horrible sense of *d√©j√† vu* overcame her. Anything beyond the hall was shrouded in darkness, despite the light. In the distance, the glass table in front of the entrance mirror was half-shrouded in darkness. It fragmented, and distorted, slowly devolving into only a hazy, deep-brown light that was nauseating to simply look at. It looked like a compressed file, only distorted and heavily corrupted beyond any physical recognition. But yet it felt like she knew what it was anyway. ‚ÄúTake one,‚Äù once more, but this time, the voice had lost its soothing tone. Now, it was more demanding;‚Äîdesperate, even. It sounded like her, but far, far younger. Five, at the very least, she inferred. ‚ÄúEvery three hours, Jade.‚Äù¬†

¬†¬†¬†It sounded so youthful, so *firm.* Distant, but clear. Far away, yet right in front of her. Firm, but wavering quiet, and timid‚Äîlike a terrified child‚Äôs poor attempt at keeping their voice down while hiding away. Heavily unlike her voice now, scratchy and coarse from years of teenage smoking. Why didn't she move? Why couldn't she move? Jade became like stone, her body would not execute the order to move. Instead, she shook. Violently, at that. The smell of gunpowder invaded her chemosensory receptors, and soon it was the only thing she could smell. Or was it just the nicotine? ‚ÄúJade,‚Äù it called, now once more soothing, like a mother to her child. ‚ÄúJade,‚Äù the voice sent a dull tingle throughout her body, and bile began its burning, agonizingly slow journey up her throat. It now sounded like a police operator calming a panicking, hidden witness while the suspects wrought havoc. It was hollow, emotionless, like they were reading lines from a script rather than making any true effort to calm her down. What officer would take the time out of their days to fully commit to calming down some*thing* that isn't even human? Did they even feel what they felt? Jade found herself asking that question every nightfall. Yet another question that made its residence in her mind without an answer to see it out.

¬†¬†¬†The drone wanted to scream, to shout‚Äîto tell whoever it was to *stop saying her name.* But the words withered to ash in her throat. Perhaps it was fear. Fear that smothered her words before they could tumble from her lips. Fear? No, she had to be fear*less*. She was the older one‚Äîjust on the sunny side of twenty-three, the very prime of her youth‚Äîshe was the role model. ‚ÄúStay calm, and *don't move*,‚Äù She had to be fierce, she had to be deadly. She had to be *perfect.* Fearless‚Ä¶ Fearless. Why was she afraid now, *what was she so afraid of?* She had the protection, even the favor of one of America‚Äôs most powerful families; *what was there to fear?* Jade felt nothing, but everything at the same time, and the question remained unanswered‚Äîan indescribable sensation that wrapped around her being like some sort of barrier. Her trembling hands finally obeyed her orders, but instead of reaching for the pill bottle, it betrayed her once more and stretched for the half-smoked cigarette docked in the ashtray to her left, and the worn lighter beside it. Maybe this would calm her nerves anyway, she thought. Smoking had always done that for her. It was all in her mind, after all. She trapped the cigarette between her index and middle finger, grasping the lighter with her free hand. Jade brought the lighter to the cigarette, flicking once, flicking twice. Thrice, a small flame emerged, illuminating her powder white optics. The cigarette glowed, streaks of reddish-orange running across the tar black tobacco like rivers of fire. The drone inhaled, feeling the smoke burn her lungs. The voice‚Äîher voice, slowly receded, as if it wasn‚Äôt even there in the first place. The image faded, and was replaced by the various windows nearly overpopulating her monitor, still working tirelessly by automation. She plucked the cigarette from her mouth, breathing out wisps of dark gray, which was quickly followed by a sharp, dusty smoker‚Äôs cough that slightly jolted her forward in her seat. The cough was a consequence of adopting this crutch of hers, one that clung stubbornly to Jade since the moment she first smoked at sixteen like a bad smell. She knew the cigs would kill her one day‚ÄîHell, they were already doing it‚Äîbut it was great at soothing her nerves. Histrionics wasn't something she was known for, and Jade would much like to keep it that way. One of the live footage displays caught her optic.¬†

¬†¬†¬†Reporters‚ÄîJade could easily identify them and their variously sized cameras, all clamoring over each other for that perfect shot for their respective media outlets. Jade exhaled, her breath taking form as a small, short-lived cloud of dark gray. Within the swarm of media pukes that had populated one of the many alleyways near *Madison* *St.*, accompanied by cop cars, their respective news channel‚Äôs trucks and various news instruments‚Äîright near the Seattle Central Library, she spotted a sharp edge. A blade? She zoomed in from the distant street camera that should *not* have been looking their way, then back out. No, it was something else. Their cameras flashed, illuminating the dark alleyway like the flash of a muzzle. Jade leaned forward, squinting her optics. What were they taking pictures of? She couldn‚Äôt quite think of anything, mainly because her mind was still reeling from the aftereffects of‚Äîwhatever that was. Jade knew; she knew full well what it truly was, but a part of herself didn‚Äôt want to believe it. She was so young, there was no way she was losing it *this early.* No, it wasn't possible. It shouldn‚Äôt even be a thought at all. Twenty-three. Merely twenty-three and with‚Äî ¬†   
  
Jade stopped herself from finishing the thought. Her stomach burned and contracted, but she kept her face a mask of neutrality with a hint of that stony, brusque gaze she had built a reputation within the Family for; a skill she had garnered from years‚Äô worth of experience. She kept herself fixated on the screen, fiercely eschewing any other thought from her mind. Or at least, trying to. Her thoughts fluttered to and fro with the pace of a pheasant unable to decide whether to trot along or take flight, before resting on one person, one of the people she loved like a sister: Viktoria. Hospital records in First Hill showed that she was currently having quite the stay in those sterile halls. She had just been admitted for attempted poisoning, the hospital report had read. A bold move, trying to take out someone so close to the Don. It was a slow-acting concoction‚Äîthe stupid bastard that had spiked her drink had slipped in expired cyanide‚Äîbut a painful one all the same that left Vik with more of an extremely resentful stomach rather than a quick death as the perp intended. ¬†   
  
But on the bright side, Jade thought, barely managing to hold back a wry half-grin that was beginning to take form on her features, it'd probably scare her away from drinking entirely, not that she drank much at all. This incident wouldn‚Äôt make the headlines, Vince had made sure of that. If it did, it'd bring some bad media attention onto the Don and gutter Vik‚Äôs respect from friends and enemies alike, something Viktoria had painstakingly and ruthlessly built for herself‚Äînot just as a drone activist‚Äôs adopted daughter, but as an enforcer. It would suggest to the common man and inquisitive journalist that either Vicky had gotten herself entangled in the Yakuza‚Äôs web and had done something to warrant retaliation, or Rossi was hiding something deeper; and no reporter, journalist, whatever media job under the sun would pass that by‚Äîthey‚Äôd be drawn to it like a swarm of moths to a large bonfire, especially the ones from the *Times*. *Nosy pricks,* Jade observed resentfully. Mackenzie was a reporter from the *Seattle Times.* About twenty-nine when he died, if the police reports she had accessed the night before were correct.¬†

¬†¬†¬†The Faceless Mob couldn‚Äôt have either possibility become reality. Vincent was still quite young, per se‚Äîjust upon the darker side of thirty-nine, crossing the horizon into forty come December‚Äîand prided himself on field work as a way to keep his prized USMC physique. But this had only consisted of throwing money at the situation (much to Andolini‚Äôs chagrin, he preferred a more‚Ä¶ physical way of handling things), something any *caporegime* had in spades. Jade took another drag, exhaling the moment she felt the smoke burn. The man who had poisoned her sister in all but relation was Haruto Ito, an ex-Kurotaka who had confused her for **LLORONA**‚Äîwhom he had only heard about via his few remaining connections within the Kurotaka-kai‚Äîand was eager to enact retribution in spite of the fact that Jade was masked during the confrontation, most possibly a desperate method of regaining respect and possibly re-entry into the Seattle Yakuza. Now that bastard was dead too. Beaten to a bloody pulp by the Don himself, Jade recalled. She toggled a secure holographic window, scrolling through her secure read mail at lightning speeds before stopping at one, and pulling it up. Sure enough, it reported in chilling detail the death of Haruto Ito, and the denial of the *Kumich≈ç* having any hand in the poisoning. Repeated blunt force trauma to the head. By the time the body was found in a dumpster far away from the *Imperator,* he was physically unrecognizable. It was true, the *Kumich≈ç* didn‚Äôt greenlight it. At least Jade hoped so. She closed the window.

¬†¬†¬†In spite of her current train of thought, shattered like glass to a gunshot, a strange limbo of thinking with a relieving clarity but also a thick midnight's fog that spread its tendrils to every part of the drone‚Äôs thought process, rendering her unable to string together any complex thought‚ÄîJade was still just as sharp a mind as the shards the shattered panes it produced, even under the restrictions that were so suddenly forced upon her. While the Arroyos were knee-deep in the drug and narcotics business and predictably made millions off of it, the Kurotaka-kai handled arms of all kinds in tandem with the Russians, certainly ironic, given their respective countries‚Äô histories with each other. They were the ones who had the most cutting-edge weaponry the very microsecond it hit shelves, from rifles to the more exotic and pricey rocket launchers and machine guns, no thanks to hundreds of bots and intricate schemes that flung the arms into their hands and in the process threw any and all tails for loops abound. The Kuros, as they were appellated by much of the Family, were a deeply intriguing mix of traditionalism and stunning progressivism, two completely incompatible ideologies that were somehow kept at bay with wondrous efficiency, kept in a precious middle. It was enigmatic how they did it, a riddle whose answer bore just as much elusivity as any member of the Family. But naturally, the ancient, albeit anachronistic, Yakuza traditionalism won out on most grounds. But as a result of that, they had a tendency to take things far too personally, especially if respect is involved‚Äî*How ironic,* a part of Jade pointed out with a predictable snarkiness‚Äîand thusly, things were very quick to get bloody if the Kurotakas were crossed. Bad for everyone involved, Jade curtly concluded before her thoughts turned to the equivalent of putty once more. It took forcing herself to rise from her seat, the trot down the stabbing cold walnut stairs and a whole cigarette smoked in a single sitting Jade scarcely registered for her mind to rebound just as the final curling vapors faded.¬†

¬†¬†¬†The house had fallen into a complete silence, like an audience left wordless even when the melody settled into silence. The reason why she had come down the stairs had fled from her mind, and Jade found herself awkwardly standing on the edge of the first step, tapping her finger on the darkwood railing at irregular intervals. Her relatively modest house‚Äîas modest as a *scrap-fucker* like her could get, which was certainly a dream home for her kind‚Äîgave an almost scenic view of the round-the-clock bustling I-5 and *Madison St.* that loomed over it. Jade was lucky both sights weren‚Äôt blocked off by the towering urban sprawl‚Äîtruth be told, she had half-expected that to be the case.¬† It also provided a clear view of the Pike Place Market district and the distant Marriott Waterfront. Jade would have taken numerous visits to the very pricey waterfront if the Arroyos hadn‚Äôt‚Äîin all practicality‚Äîowned the coastline of Seattle up to West Point Lighthouse and was in no mood to share any piece of it, and that it was completely inaccessible to drones. The rest of the Seattle coastline went to the Russians and Kuros, leaving the Bennelis and, consequently, the Rossi Family landlocked.¬†

¬†¬†¬†She allowed her powder white optics to drift, slowly scanning up and down the stairs in her peripheral vision even though she knew there was no danger to look out for. A common teaching Don Rossi had ingrained into not just her poor excuse for a brain was always living with caution. Caution was a *mafioso‚Äôs* best friend, and it had certainly saved Jade from the grave more times than she bothered to count. *What did I come down here for?* She wondered. Her thought process worked at the pace of an asthmatic snail. The sharpness Jade had not mere minutes ago exhibited had vanished as if she had just been reset. Something in the corner of her vision shifted, and against every instinct, reflex, and commandment years in the Family had instilled in her; she went rigid, as still and stiff as board. The only thing that moved was her arm, like it had a mind of its own. It flew to her neck, grasping at her necklace‚Äîa silver cross necklace she should‚Äôve yanked off her neck long ago, and the only memory of whoever she stayed with before‚Ä¶ Before what? *The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want‚Ä¶*  ¬† The old Psalm populated her barren and fogged mind before she could stop it. What good would it serve, when years of repeating it each night only to lay awake far past midnight was the only result it had shown? It was the reason she stopped praying when she hit seventeen. Years and years of entreaties and sinking her head into the Bible she had stuffed away in some forgotten corner of her old room for hours on end when she wasn‚Äôt out ‚Äúpersuading‚Äù business owners to pay up had amounted to naught. They had flown up to the night sky and wilted in the air. Why hadn't God taken her *out* of this ‚Äúlife,‚Äù as they called it? Her grip tightened on the foot of the small cross, but her shoulder only shook. For years, it had been problem after problem‚Äînot that she could remember much of it, anyway‚Äîand what had God done? Nothing, precisely nothing. Sat back in his plush, golden throne room flocked by angels, leaned back and laughed at every mistake, every fuck up, every tear Jade had blundered herself into. Why couldn‚Äôt He pull her up from the waves, like He did with Peter‚ÄîOr was it Paul? Jade couldn‚Äôt remember‚Äîspread his arms out and just say the words; those words that rendered a whole raging typhoon of a sea to a docile pond that produced not a single ripple? For all the times she had spent minutes‚Äî*eternities*‚Äîpraying, the only answer she had ever gotten was a brush of cold air. The corner of¬† Jade‚Äôs lips twitched in an attempt to form itself into a scowl. *What did I do to deserve this?* ¬†   
  
‚Äú***I can think of a few things,***‚Äù There was that voice again. As if it was right beside her, casually interjecting as if it could read her mind‚Äîa faint, hollow echo that sounded like it was coming from another room. It *was* her mind, after all. How does one keep secrets from one‚Äôs own mind? What was supposed to be a shudder only came out as a poorly controlled tremor, and her grip tightened once more on the necklace. Her body remained stock-still. The cool air that poured from somewhere in the house brushed against her casing, slithering up her light brown sweater she always wore when she was home. The moment the blades licked her skin her body lost its rigidness, and in an instant she turned on her heel and quite mindlessly trotted back up the stairs as if nothing had happened. It was a cycle Jade had learned to live with: A rush of being, then nothingness. The inability to think properly at all‚Äîmaybe for hours, maybe for a day or two‚Äîthen in a flash, it returns, accompanied by rapid-fire images ranging from every single worst-case scenario Jade‚Äôs mind had ever constructed, some as outlandish and simplistic as a child‚Äôs fear of the dark, others‚Äî ¬†   
  
Jade shook her head with such intensity she thought her neck would snap. Her foot caught on the large triangular step marking the beginning of the short flight of stairs that led to the upstairs region of the house. The possibilities and rationalizations once again started their sprint back and forth: Had someone rigged anything? Would her next step be her last? Her throat dried, sparking a dull burn in the back that was quick to spread downward, and she froze mid-step. Questions that zoomed about like sugar-highed children played table tennis with her ability to quickly decipher them. Hadn‚Äôt she painstakingly checked and re-checked nearly the whole house just an hour before she retreated to her desk? Her mind once more flashed with warbled, flickering dreams of slamming her fist against the nearest solid surface, but her muscles only tensed up. The other choices had melted into incomprehensibility, a stream of unrelated questions and what-ifs that collided with the stifling void that rested in the pit of her stomach along with the dulled acidic burn of caffeine from the coffee she had ingested no short of a couple hours ago. The acrid phantom stench of cigarette smoke burned her chemosensory receptors‚Äîa familiar burn, one that failed to draw a cough from her dully scratching throat. *Maybe someone had spiked that too,* she offhandedly thought. *Maybe I‚Äôll be dead in the next couple minutes.* She mentally snickered like an upstart schoolgirl setting eyes on prey. *Wouldn‚Äôt that be nice.* Her mind attempted to scrawl up what death would be like. Perhaps it was just like the end of an old black and white movie. Maybe she‚Äôd hear the faint squealing of white noise. Maybe she‚Äôd still be there, floating and drenched in a suffocating black that kept wrapping itself around her and squeezing until she forgot she even existed before this. Perpetually drowning ‚Äòneath a lake of blackened waves and infinite depth‚Äîunable to see, hear, even scream. It was the only string of possibilities Jade didn‚Äôt bother trying to force out of her brain‚Äôs projector room. It‚Äôd be a hopeless fight anyway, much like with all of the other barbarous intrusions. The good part was that it faded away within the hour.   
  
Her vision lost its focus, the world‚Äôs edges smudged somewhat. She blinked‚Äîonce, twice, thrice‚Äîeverything regained its definition, then drooped once again. Her field of vision hadn‚Äôt lost its sharpness this time, only it had merely lost its focus. Jade leaned on the railing, scarcely registering that she had fully climbed upstairs or the icy press of the wood. Her gaze floated down to the opaque rectangular windows parallel to the front door, trying to see through the blurred glass. Anything beyond the window looked like a hazy, vague painting splattered onto the pavement by some irresponsible oaf. A self-toggled AR window pulled itself up without as much as a *ding* precipitating it, nearly making the young drone noticeably jump backwards. Nearly.  ¬† It was merely a *Times* newsletter she had forgotten to turn off auto-display on‚Äîa journalist rambling on and on about some‚Ä¶ Wait a damn minute. Jade‚Äôs gaze sharpened, and she carefully scanned the article, jumping past the ads unabashedly displaying women in barely-there dresses. Then again. And again. **FBI WATCHER SHOT DOWN IN DOWNTOWN SEATTLE**, the title read in full, bold text. Her mind flashed back to that blade‚Äîin the first, and possibly last show of cooperation for this whole day‚Äîno, Watcher. That was what had been shot down? Those things were supposed to be far too quick for a bullet, Jade recalled from what she and her team had gathered. But it did have a *very* short break period and a predictable, pre-directed route. If what was in the article was indeed true‚Äîthough she took the news with more than an inch of salt‚Äîthen Uzi had attracted the attention of the Bureau. Fear surged through Jade‚Äôs veins. *Not good. Not good.* She dashed off to her room,¬† throwing on a firmly crumpled but never worn ripped denim jacket over her black long-sleeve undershirt, jeans to match, and a *Superunknown* baseball cap‚Äîshe had kept it ever since a then-seventeen year old Uzi had gifted her the hat and the vinyl for her twenty-first birthday after months spent saving; both of which she had taken a liking to. The hat pressed her silverish-white pigtails down, creating a dull pressure that served more to annoy than inflict pain. The purple-haired youngster would still be stuck in the academic purgatory that was the University of Seattle, Jade‚Äôs mind interjected in a rare attempt to sooth her spiked nerves. Uzi wouldn‚Äôt exactly be a *prime* suspect given her circumstance. After all, there were thousands of drones in Seattle to falsely accuse of this incident. *Maybe it was someone else?* Jade hoped with all of what remained of her soul that that was indeed the case. Jade quickly pulled up a secure messaging network directly linked to Don Rossi; the messages would be deleted within the next thirty minutes, leaving no trace behind for anyone at all.  ¬†   
  
**GUESS WHO‚ÄôS IN TOWN.** She typed, quickly following it up with the link to the news article as she darted down the steps. She stopped short on the last one, planting the rim of her palm on the corner of the wall. In a second, a block of what was to the uneducated observer simply drywall folded back and slowly elevated upward, locking in place. It revealed a small, musty-smelling wooden compartment and a well taken care of *M1911.* Jade swiped the sleek black gun from its holding place, sticking a finger up between the inner drywall and the faux one. She clicked a button intelligently hidden between the two with the tip of her finger and quickly retracted her hand just as the block slowly came back down and locked in place. Jade had quickly learned to never leave the house without the gun, save for a few exceptions. The drone adroitly stashed the small pistol away in her inner jacket pocket‚Äîany other gun would be far too obvious, given her choice of clothing. Just enough to be an adequate shield to the November elements; but not thick enough to hide away a revolver. The lock was Jade‚Äôs own brainchild, an intricate fingerprint lock hidden away in plain sight that only used the side of her palm and played into her habit of pressing the side of her palm on the corner wall that marked the beginning of the stairwell. Habits were a fatal thing to have in ‚ÄúThe Life‚Äù‚Äîworse than any bullet or blade, but Jade kept some of them anyway, mainly due to her therapist endorsing them as a way to keep her ‚Äúgrounded.‚Äù The natural exception being her relationship with the ‚Äúcancer sticks.‚Äù She slipped into a pair of black *Air Forces*, wrapping her hand around the silver knob that separated her house from her small garage.  ¬† Jade pressed her body against the door, straining her auditory receptors for anything that would indicate an unwanted surprise on the other side. She had more than a significant amount of precautions for a situation like that, but one could never be too sure. *Better safe than sorry,* the youngster repeated as she inched the door open. Her optics squeezed shut, and she took a sharp breath. No click. No explosion that would render her a puddle of tar black paste and burnt to a crisp clothing on her wall. Only silence that seemed to stretch on until the end of time.   
  
She exhaled heavily, and fully pulled the door open, trotting down the short three-step that led into the garage. Besides the evident stench of petrol and engine oil, a stylish navy blue 3070 Beamer sat patiently in the middle of the surprisingly clean garage. Light filtered in from the small windows atop the garage door, casting just enough of a glow to identify any bomb planted‚Äîto Jade‚Äôs relief, there was none. It didn‚Äôt stop her from stooping down and spending the better half of ten minutes checking herself, however. Just like the light had demonstrated, there were indeed no explosives lying in wait under her car. The drone straightened up, pressing her finger against the driver‚Äôs window barrier and watching the car start up. The door popped open. ‚Äú**GOOD AFTERNOON, MRS. ROSSI.**‚Äù The automated voice welcomed as Jade climbed inside. She pulled up yet another window, running streams of white colored code and punching in a string of programming and closing out the window. The moment the window was closed, the garage door flipped open with a jarring speed, and light beamed into the car. Jade squinted her eyes, pulling out of the garage despite the blinding midday sunlight and expertly pulling her car into traffic heading northward on *Boren Avenue.*

I hope my review helps.  
  
From April 2023 0 -> B2 Dec 2024 while working a full time job and having a life  
  
My partner is native and his family speaks only German, so I am in for a treat every coffee and dinner, so you understand my motivation is intertwined with desperation, I am also looking for a job here in Germany after immigrating from my Eastern European home and quitting my job and confort zone in the name of love.  
  
My journey with Lingoda started in April 2023, I started with a Sprint, my advice: it's only worth it if you have the the certainty you can attend every f day.  
  
Lingoda, itself, it's a great platform with very good teachers, serious classmates and thorough rules that kind of ""motivate"" you to stay disciplined.  
  
What I wished I knew as a beginner in Apr 2024:  
  
Orientation class is a waste of your credit because it basically just presents the platform, DM me and I will send you a summary of what happens there and save your actual learning credit.  
If you like a teacher, you can go to the that teachers board and book their classes, I swear having a class with a teacher I liked made the biggest difference.(My German recommendations: Agnieska, Ozlem, Julia, Branislav, etc).  
\*hint: book from ahead of time and aim to have classes as early in the morning as possible since that s when you have the chances of being just you and the teacher or just 2 people and the teacher = more speaking time, basically a 1o1 class on sale.  
  
3. Prepare for every class with the vocabulary and do the homework or exercises proposed as homework in the previous class.  
  
4. Try to stay as chronological as possible with the classes because the level between Chapter 1-2-3 vs 11-12 is very different and it just smooths your learning curve.  
  
5. You only need to do 45 classes/50 to get the certificate, my advice is to skip first orientation and some of the starting communication classes( even if you skip them you can book the class, download the material and cancel immediately using the 30 min after book free cancellation policy). NEVER skip in GRAMMAR classes because in my opinion are the most important.  
  
As a comparison to Babbel Live, Lingoda offers more, the certificate is recognized and Lingoda has for B1 135 classes offer, while Babbel has only 36, focusing mainly on speaking.  
  
If you are thinking about trying out Lingoda here is my referral link: [https://referral.lingoda.com/6Dr9Cv](https://referral.lingoda.com/6Dr9Cv)  
  
I dig monthly for discounts because I am a cheap as that can't pay full price so I got most of the months 20-30% discounts on plans for 20-40 classes so the price/class stayed in 7-8 eur range which is cheaper than a class in my home country.  
  
No hidden truth: you get paid for recommending Lingoda, but what I would offer you is a free 30 mins presentation from my account of their possibilities and my honest B1.2 from 0 feedback after many errors I wish I knew better.",1,1734438207.0,Manifestation,1,1.0,False

1hg9ebh,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1hg9ebh/my_top_ten_starbucks_in_japan/,My Top Ten Starbucks in Japan,"As a tourist who happens to be a photographer, I am almost always up at sunrise when in another country. And as much as I might want to avoid it, Japan's general cafe opening hours of nine/ten in the morning are not early enough and I end up in a Starbucks every other day. But despite my severe reservations about partaking in American coffee while in Japan and my massive desire to 'eat/drink like a local' I discovered that most of the people in Starbucks, in Japan, are Japanese. It helped to ease my guilt.

Before I get into my top ten, I should mention one major difference between branches where I am from (Glasgow, Scotland) and those across the great nation of Japan; everyone buses their own tray. You should too.

Here's the countdown, based purely on personal preference;

**10. Starbucks Coffee - Kaminarimon**

You'd think the Starbucks closest to Senso-ji would be constantly busy and whilst that can be true, hit this place up at just the right time and it becomes a haven away from the crowds with a surprisingly spacious upstairs and an alright view of the Kaminarimon Gate if you nab a corner window seat. Staff have especially good English skills and endless patience.

**9. Starbucks Coffee - Takayama Okamoto**

In the unlikely event that you tire of the charm of eastern Takayama's old town and hida beef on a stick. Head out of the other side of the train station and just beyond the bowling alley and amusement arcade you will find this very modern branch, complete with drive-thru. The perfect reminder of Japan as a land of constrast.

**8. Starbucks Coffee - Shibuya, Fire-dori Street**

Shibuya Crossing Starbucks is hugely overrated and though you can take two good photos from here (one horizontal and one vertical) looking down onto the intersection, there's a better outlet nearby that only locals know about. Just five minutes walk towards Harajuku and past two other Starbucks you'll find the Fire-dori Street branch with a nice view of the Yamanote Line crossing a road. Also a great place to shake your fist at tourists passing by in go-karts.

**7. and 6. Starbucks Coffee - Osaka Castle Park/Osaka Castle Park Morinomiya**

I know, I know, I'm cheating here by putting two that are in the same location. Both are on the east side of the castle and served by JR and Metro lines. The Osaka Castle Park branch has more of a commuter vibe while the southern Morionomiya branch is for dog walkers and regular people walkers. Both are perfect for a pick-me-up after sunrise photos but be careful of the different closing times if you're there late on in the day (northern branch closes at ten while the other closes earlier at nine).

**5. Starbucks Coffee - Karuizawa Prince Shopping Plaza**

I like to talk a lot of shit about Karuizawa generally. But this Starbucks is the best cafe in Japan for big, fluffy dog watching. And as such deserves a place on this list. Get lucky and you might also see the big, fluffy dogs scare their small, yappier brethren. And as with the Kaminarimon branch; great english and endless patience.

**4. Starbucks Coffee - Shinjuku 3(San)-chome**

You're staying in Shinjuku and want a reliable coffee from near your hotel but those around the station are simply too busy for your liking? Shinjuku 3(San)-chome has you covered, the perfect balance of busy and not busy. Get there early enough and watch people walk to work while you plan your day of leisure. But be warned that the word is out about this formerly unknown spot for locals. You might not be the only gaijin in the place if that's what you're looking for.

**3. Starbucks Coffee - Kawagoe Kanetsuki-dori Street**

The new reigning 'in-keeping-with-local-aesthetic' champion. More people were taking photos of this Starbuks than the nearby historical bell tower. Really lovely outdoor area out the back too. Recommended while you wait for your turn to make chopsticks.

**2. Starbucks Coffee - Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden**

You've finished your Makoto Shinkai pilgramage to Shinjuku, seen the *Your Name* steps and looked around the National Garden for the gazebo. What better way to take a load off than with perhaps the best Starbucks outdoor area in Japan? One whole side of the building offers park views but be warned; the seats are in high demand and you may end up with the students cramming their studies on the communal tables instead.

**1. Starbucks Coffee - Shinshu Zenkoji Nakamise-dori Street**

The former 'in-keeping-with-local-aesthetic' title holder is still one of the more surprising branches out there. It's wooden facade might match the souvenir and soft-cream stores around it but inside is a decidely modern and spacious interior with one of the widest staircases I have ever walked up in Japan. It also holds a dear place in my heart as the first place I ever received a '**Êó•Êú¨Ë™û ‰∏äÊâã „Åß„Åô„Å≠**' to which I responded with the obligatory '**„Åæ„Å†„Åæ„Å†**'. Hence the number one placing, the pull of bias was simply too strong.

The timing couldn‚Äôt have been more perfect as last minute plans sprung up to visit friends around the country; one flying in from the United States to meet with mutual friends just outside Birmingham England, and more who live up in Glasgow Scotland. This trip happened at the end of November.

# Day 1: Tyne and Wear to Wellington - 214mi/344km

[Charging at Skelton Lake Services, Leeds](https://preview.redd.it/4s7gz5so6e7e1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a4d1945f38fbc121afdc0160c8b3feb1014e908)

It‚Äôs raining, freezing temperatures, and it‚Äôs windy. It‚Äôs the worst possible scenario for any car, but especially an EV with an Iron Phosphate battery. I‚Äôm a responsible little gremlin and take regular breaks at least every two hours so I planned a stop at the new Skelton Lake services in Leeds as having never done a long journey in this car I was unsure how it would perform in poor weather at motorway speeds, thus I decided to get a top-up.

I connected to an Ionity brand charger and used my ‚ÄúOctopus Electroverse‚Äù card to initiate and pay for the charge. For those not in the know, my home energy provider (Octopus Energy) dished out free RFID cards for people on EV tariffs; at a supported charger you simply tap it as you would a debit or credit card and the charge will be billed to your electricity bill. Honestly fantastic and I wish it was universal given my account is constantly in credit. Regardless of what card you use, you simply connect the plug and tap once.

I only added 14.54kWh to the battery as I got a coffee and cinnamon bun in the frankly lovely Skelton Services (North Americans, take note, this is what a motorway stop should be rather than the depressing gas stations with half a Wendys stapled to them I had to endure in Canada and the north eastern US).

Everything simply worked. That makes for a boring post, but it truly did. After my brief layover I drove the remaining 129 miles in a single shot. Other than the dismal weather there was nothing wrong with the entire journey. If I hadn't have topped up, I would've arrived at my destination with, if I recall, between 10 to 12% remaining, putting the motorway range of this car at 240-ish miles / 386-ish km, or an efficiency rating of 2.9mi/kWh (4.6km/kWh). Given it was below freezing, exclusively at motorway speeds and with the heating on at a comfortable level I'm more than satisfied with that number.

# Day 2: England to Scotland - 282mi/453km

[Charging at Telford Services](https://preview.redd.it/3kd0pd7u6e7e1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d79f3059d0f1ec1bc2fd784b4afa5df03fc8b78)

I left mid-day and the weather was still horrible, sadly (IE bloody freezing). I made my way to the Telford Services to charge my car using the heavily signposted and advertised Applegreen Chargers: up to 400kW delivery and a GIANT bank of them, too!

Surprise, surprise, I get there and there is only a construction site. Remember, these are already signposted and available on many charging maps. The only charging option were two ancient 50kW unit that still had a Chademo connector, as the Tesla chargers there weren‚Äôt open to all electrics yet (but I guess the construction was messing with those stations because they weren‚Äôt having a good time of it from the looks of things).

Still, despite the slow charge speed, the services were nice and warm and the charger was retrofitted with a debit card reader. I charged to 60% to give me enough to drive the 128mi/205km to another service station in Burton-In-Kendal. I‚Äôm glad I charged to 60 because I arrived with a scant 9% remaining! 128-ish miles using 51% of the battery is pretty great, IMO, given the conditions (freezing, windy, eventually rain, lots of hills), exclusively motorway speeds (70mph/112kph). I‚Äôm not going to grumble. This was around 3mi/kWh (4.8km/kWh).

Cardinal sin, but I charged to 100% in Burton in Kendal as I chomped down on a burger. It was a giant bank of Gridserve units that were truly trivial to use, well sign posted and reasonably fast. I wanted this 150 mile leg of the journey done in one shot with plenty remaining as it was getting dark, it was still raining, windy, and the M74 had construction and later, rush hour traffic. Given a lot of the motorway is unlit as well it made for a truly miserable time on the road, but I kept the podcasts going and the cabin warm and just muscled through. I forget how much charge I had when I finally arrived (I believe it was 30%), but it wasn't great given the traffic, constant up-hill (Scotland and all that) and heavy wind; probably the least efficient portion of the trip, hovering around 2.6mi/kWh (4.19km/kWh).

[Charging and Polmadie Siding Lane](https://preview.redd.it/vp3cuhga7e7e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b3ff7a566ce7065a02c30735d8e178efcc8c069)

Two nights in Glasgow and it was time to leave. I stopped at the Ionity charging station at Siding Lane in Polmadie. This was a much, much smaller services, but the Starbucks was fine and the little ASDA express had some other amenities inside like a Greggs and warm places to sit. There was a little bit of a queue here as people had abandoned their cars to do whatever it was they were doing despite the charge being complete. Mercifully it was only a 15 minutes wait. The only confusion here was the card reader; there was only one and it was located on a post between charger two and three rather than on the dispenser itself. Strange, but fine. It caught a few people off guard for sure.

I also charged to 100% again as there was no queue behind me and I wanted to do the trip in one shot with plenty remaining. Like every other trip, it just worked, with the only negatives being the terrible weather and one quirk of my car: there‚Äôs no low washer fluid warning (the manual suggests periodically checking manually) so I had to pull into a layby on the A69. Again, I‚Äôm a responsible little gremlin so I had a full bottle of ready-to-use washer fluid in the boot.

Total cost of charging: ¬£145.16 - before tax this is ‚Ç¨145.19 / US$152.24 / C$217.42 / AU$240.13

It‚Äôs expensive, sure, but cheaper than petrol, especially in a car of similar performance (500hp+ / 390kW). Part of the problem is the tax rate has yet to be adjusted for public charging, so it‚Äôs at the full 20% rate instead of 5% for other fuel types.

Of course, I'd much rather take the damn train, and if I wasn't going only to Glasgow I would've done given a ticket was only ¬£15.

To give a comparison with the Tesla Model 3 Dual Motor (that my older Brother owns), you're looking at around a 30mi/48km discrepancy in favour of the Tesla for a similar trip, albeit I have the power on par with the Model 3 Performance, of which ""real world"" figures on the internet suggest I'm within margin of error; Inside EVs did a winter test and had achieved 218mi from their Model 3 performance, for example, Bj√∏rn Nyland achieved 211mi (albeit at a slightly higher speed of 74mph), where my least efficient portion of the trip would've achieved 214mi.

Overall I clearly needn‚Äôt worry about range in the future, and to a certain degree pricing. Long trips are more than viable and the amenities at motorway charging points are comfortable and sometimes (like with Skelton) excellent. Unless you live in the middle of a cornfield in nowhere USA, you've really got no excuse to go electric even for long trips.",2,1734437813.0,electricvehicles,4,0.63,False
