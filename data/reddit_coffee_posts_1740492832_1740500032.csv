It needs to fill a 12–16oz cup in a single cycle. We would sell coffee, lattes, iced coffee, hot chocolate and maybe a few other options. This information (output size) is incredibly hard to find and I'm hoping people who have the machines can offer advice.

I'm considering De’Longhi Eletta Explore for their to-go cup options but open to other, better, easier, or cheaper options. Must be easy for our cashier to operate. We currently use a Philips lattego, but it requires 2 cycles to fill standard size cups.

Does anyone have a superautomatic that will produce 12 oz and 16 oz drinks in one go?

1ixymid,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1ixymid/hell_holds_no_suprises_for_me_anymore/,Hell holds no suprises for me anymore.,"This is a cautionary tale and - unlike most of the other reviews on this product - this is a true story and its authenticity can be qualified by a small news item that appeared in the Toronto Star's local news section during the month of April in 2013, much to my chagrin.

I would consider myself a prudent man. Not given to bouts of outspokenness or craving attention, and certainly not one to rock the boat. On any given day I can be found reading a crime novel on a park bench in the middle of the city, soaking in the opulence of nature while nibbling on my tuna fish sandwiches and fending off the voracious gulls and squirrels that threaten to spoil my repose. This is me. Law-abiding and introspective. Which is why it came as a shock to me to find myself incarcerated because of the Devil's Confectionery, Satan's Sweetmeat, Lucifer's Lozenges - the horror that is known as 'Haribo Sugar Free Gummy Bears"".

I'll set the scene: It was late winter / early spring in Toronto and the city had just been digging itself out from a late season snow-storm. I was heading to Pearson International Airport for a redeye flight to Amsterdam in order to give the Dutch arm of our company some training on the new software that had been installed (I'm deliberately being vague to prevent my place of work from being linked in any way to the incident that occurred). I had just finished packing, checked the time and found I was running late, my flight was at 7:10 PM and it was now almost 5:00 PM. Cursing softly, I ran out to the car and threw my bags in the trunk, hitting the gas a little harder than usual in my haste to make it to the Long Term Parking Lot as soon as possible. Luckily traffic was light on the 401 and I made it to the airport in record time, but knew that my chances of making the flight were still at risk if I didn't use my time wisely.

I hadn't eaten since lunch, and I was feeling a bit hungry, my stomach rumbling loudly in protestation, which caused me to look around at the other travellers rushing past me in the busy terminal, mortified that my bodily noises might be heard by others. I briskly checked my watch and decided that I had enough time to grab a quick snack before going through the baggage check and security, and would get something more substantial once I was checked through security. I spotted a vending machine nestled in a relatively low-traffic corner of the terminal and rushed over, already pulling out my credit-card and mentally assessing what I had a craving for so as to save time interacting with the machine. My eyes scanned the colourful array of confection quickly, coming to rest on a tantalizing, rainbow-coloured bag of gummy bears with the simple white and red logo ""Haribo"" emblazoned across the bag in what appeared to be a slightly tweaked Helvetica Rounded font.

Now I'd to pause here in the story for a moment to underscore the importance of making proper choices. I was hungry. When you're hungry, you should eat FOOD. FOOD is defined as ""a nutritious substance that people consume to maintain life"", this is what food is. These days, the definition of the word 'food' has been bastardized and the meaning has been broadened to include veritably any material that can be digested, or rather, chewed and swallowed without causing death or severe illness. ""Haribo Sugar Free Gummy Bears"" are NOT food. They aren't even from this planet. I imagine their origins being conceived in a boardroom in hell by a top team of Creative Pain Administers, with senior level Demons rubbing their hands together in ghoulish delight as Hell's Chief Chemist slowly lifts the veil on their new creation.

The point here being, I made a very, very, very poor choice. I pushed the button and the vending machine ejected the brightly coloured bag into my awaiting hands. I had always liked gummy bears - they were bright but rather innocuous, they weren't overly sweet so as to become cloying and - of course - each candy came in the visage of a rather happy, docile bear reminiscent of the picture one's mind's eye holds of all anthropomorphic bears from Yogi to Winnie.

The way I figured it, I was taking a bit of a holiday from life, so I could relax my fastidiously regimented daily schedule a little to allow for some frivolity. After all, I was going to be in Amsterdam come morning with 16 hours to kill before I had to be training the Dutch employees, maybe I would take a trip down to one of the Coffee Shops in the Red-Light District and really let my hair down! No, I wouldn't do that. I would see that area of the city from the bus as I went to the hotel where I would eat at the hotel restaurant and drink sparkling water. So I'd better enjoy the gummy bears, my one extravagance to commemorate my break from routine.

I joined the queue in the KLM line, which was mercifully short, most likely because all of the passengers for my flight had already been checked through as the flight was scheduled to depart in an hour. I checked my watch again, frowned, and absent-mindedly opened the bag of ""Haribo Sugar Free Gummy Bears"" and began to munch on them as the line slowly advanced. To be fair, they tasted fine - just like every other manufacturer's brand of the colourful candy, and they were sugar-free to boot. This is what made the whole incident that followed so baffling - if they had tasted 'off' or 'different' I most likely wouldn't have continued to shovel them into my mouth absent-mindedly while daydreaming about what I would order to eat from room-service in my hotel in Amsterdam.

As I gave the attendant my e-ticket and she weighed my bags, the first of the pains began in my stomach. I thought nothing of it at first, chalking it up to the fact that I needed something more substantial than gummy worms to tackle my hunger, but over the course of the next five-minutes the shooting pain began to come in more rapid succession. At this point, I had my boarding pass printed and rubbing my stomach a little, I proceeded to security. I briefly entertained the thought of trying to find a restroom before going through security, but at that point my discomfort was manageable and I didn't think it was get any worse, certainly not within the amount of time it would take to clear security.

I joined the line and started fishing for my passport to present to the agent checking tickets, I felt a thin sheen of sweat break out on my forehead and underarms, and my features flushed for a moment as a wave of heat washed over me. I didn't pay it much heed as going through security always caused me great anxiety and I chalked it up to pre-flight jitters. It was only as I stood face to face with the agent and handed her my passport and ticket that I had a glimpse of the agony that was about to begin. It felt like time rippled for a moment, as if my consciousness buckled so intense was the pain that fired through my bowels. I grimaced spastically and emitted a low moan, and felt myself take an involuntary step sideways. Stars shot though my head briefly and my vision blurred and then snapped back into focus. The agent was staring at me with slight consternation and asked me if I was alright. I pulled myself together, stood up straight and declared that I was fine, mortified that I had had a lapse of decorum not only in public but at the security clearance in an airport!

As I fumbled off my belt to go through the metal detector, the pain in my stomach increased and I practically had to sit on the floor to take my shoes off, terrified of what would happen if I bent at the middle to do it. It was becoming increasingly more evident to me that this wasn't just a stomach ache. No, this was something much worse. As a child I had had a bout of diarrhea after a trip to Mexico with my family, I remember the feeling of nausea that swept through me before my child self had surrendered to the gas pains and parked myself on the toilet for an hour, s***ting until I felt like I didn't have any bones left. And that was how I was feeling now, with several key differences - the pain was worse, the sense of an impending bowel movement was so formidable it gave me temporary amnesia, and it took all of my will-power, all of it, to clench my butt cheeks together to prevent my sphincter from exploding.

A sudden shock of pain racked my body, and I half wondered if I was going to give birth to a Tasmanian Devil. The crazy, fever-induced image of said cartoon animal chasing Bugs Bunny through the splashy, volcanic s***-kettle that was my stomach, caused me to illicit a short, maniacal bark of laughter as I approached the Metal detector, a wild, distant look in my eyes, sweat now beginning to poor off of my like a long-distance runner in Kenya. The security agent on the other side of the detector shot a quick glance over to her co-worker who narrowed his eyes and made a subtle movement towards his holster. My breathing became uneven as I entered the metal detector and I realized with alarm that I had taken off my socks without even registering it, and one of my shirt tails was untucked at the front. I held my breath, my eyes bulging dangerously from my head as the machine scanned me. As I shakily moved forward towards the agent for a pat down, my stomach began to illicit sounds that can only be described as otherworldly. It started off a sort-off bubbling sound heard from afar and grew in pitch and intensity at an alarming rate. My jaw dropped in shock as what I can only describe as the sound of an agonized wailing alley-cat in heat with a persistent Doppler effect added to it's voice emitted from some nether-region of my intestines. The officer's eyes widened in alarm, and she kept her eyes glued to my stomach as she thoroughly patted me down. As she reached my shins, I felt my innards suddenly expand, and plummet towards my rectum. With cat-like reflexes I squeezed my sphincter shut with what seemed like nano-seconds to spare, and I knew, I KNEW that if I didn't get the bathroom immediately I would s*** myself.

With a Herculean effort and all of the strength that I could muster, I forced my buttcheeks together knowing that one false move would open the floodgates. I began to walk like a duck, trying to remain as inconspicuous as possible, not even caring now what other people were seeing in front of them - a disheveled, barefoot 40-year-old business man, red-faced and bulgy-eyed, sweating profusely, shaking slightly and walking without bending his knees. With single-minded intensity I grabbed my carry-on, shoes and socks from out of the plastic tub that had passed the x-ray inspection, and without putting anything back on, I turned on my heels with the intention of finding the nearest restroom and slowly dying there one squirt at a time.

But that's not what happened.

I turned to go and found myself staring at three armed agents who stopped me and asked if I would follow them. ""Why, what's the matter?"" I stammered, wincing slightly as the act of speech seemed to strain the tenuous and extremely fragile truce I had negotiated between my bowels and the tempest that raged within. ""I have to go the bathroom, RIGHT NOW"" I pleaded. ""Just follow us please"", they said, leaving no room for argument. The other travellers clearing the security check stared with curiosity and revulsion at the spectacle unfolding before them, whispering amongst themselves and hurrying to pack up their belongings and get as far away from me as possible, no doubt assuming that the airport had nabbed some sort of domestic terrorist. If I hadn't been feverishly trying to hold back the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, I likely would have died of shame.

With each step I took towards the room that they ushered me into, I felt that my legs would give way. I marvelled at how strong the human will could be. Marvelled at what was essentially patching a hole in the Hoover Dam with bubblegum could actually be sustained indefinitely. Maybe I would make it through this ordeal after all. The room they brought me into was an examination room. I had pretty much stopped registering details of my environment as my consciousness closed off all but the absolutely necessary functions - breathing, ability to walk - but I snapped back to reality when I heard the snap of rubber. The slow dawning of realization poked through my agony and stoic resolve as I turned to face an agent dawning rubber gloves.

""Sir, we are going to perform a cavity search on you"", a young fresh-faced agent stated in a firm but emotionless voice. His short-cropped, blond hair was immaculate and for a crazy moment I wondered if he was an actor and this was all some sort of elaborate practical joke done to amuse bored kids watching Youtube. He must have taken my tortured silence for resistance because he looked at me sharply and said ""Lower your pants and underwear please, and face the desk"". Panic started to grip me in it's icy grasp and the sudden adrenaline threatened to destroy my sphincters bulwarks and rend my anus in two. I inhaled sharply and with a pained gasp I doubled up my efforts to clench my cheeks together. ""Sir, please"", I begged deferring to this kid in an act of desperation, ""I have to go to the bathroom. You can follow me into the stall if you need to but I had some bad ""Haribo Sugar Free Gummy Bears"" and now I feel like'"", but they had stopped listening and smirked at each other, two of the other agents - a tall, dark-haired female and a shorter, balding fat man - looked away from me and I could see them shaking a little as they stifled their laughs. ""Sir, face the wall, put your hands on the desk and spread your cheeks"" the young agent stated, a lop-sided grin on his face. ""But'"", I began to protest, and then a fresh shock of pain forced me to stop and lean on the table for support as an ungodly howling rose from my stomach, something between the dying moans of a Wholly Mammoth, and the sound of bubble-wrap popping underwater. I exhaled shakily and my focus began to narrow, as I rallied for the final battle. Shaking uncontrollably and sweat literally raining down onto the tabletop in from of me, I turned to face the wall and heard a meek childlike voice, pleading from somewhere in the room. ""Please"", it said, and then again, ""Please"". From somewhere within me my mind recognized that this sound had issued from me, although my consciousness had now begun to separate from my body and I held my breath and prayed to God for strength.

""He probably has some heroin or something up there that opened up"", the female guard said as a part of me that hadn't escaped into the ether yet acknowledged that she was behind me to my left, ""probably high as a kite, LOOK at him"", she said. The shorter guard agreed with a snort, off to my right.

""Spread your cheeks"" the young agent said, his voice directly behind me and lower than the other two, ""and bend over"".

""Pleasegodpleasegodpleasegodpleasegod"", I whispered in a desperate, maniacal mantra, not even aware of my surroundings anymore. I felt like I was lost in an opium fog with half-snatched images and sounds filtering through to create a nonsensical version of reality. Another volley of pain tore through me and I involuntarily leaned forward over the desk, my focus completely narrowed now to a spot on the wall two feet in front of me, a curious imperfection in the what seemed to be white-washed stone wall. It was a dark blotch about five millimetres long and shaped like a smiling bear, a yellow dancing bear. No, a green bear. No, red. It was all the colours of the rainbow. My god, it was beautiful.

It just took something as simple as a slight breeze to trigger Armegeddon. That's all. No trumpets, no fanfare, no fire raining from the heavens, no dogs and cats living together in harmony, no finger on the button, no prophet to predict it, no nothing. As I stared at the rainbow bear smiling and dancing in front of me, my mouth agape, drooling, eyes glazed and blood-shot, face coated with a sheen of sweat, I heard the softest sound, an exhalation from the young agent behind me, and then at the same instant the warm air of his breath feather across my butt cheeks. For just a moment, maybe less, maybe a split second, even a nanosecond, I felt the presence of God there with me in that room as neurons began to misfire at a blinding rate, nerve ending bristled and muscles twitched reflexively. I stood on the brink with one foot hovering over the edge, and then without taking a step, I found myself plummeting.

With a sound like an extra large plastic ketchup bottle being run over by a Mac truck, my sphincter released. The pressure of the blast pushed me hard into the desk and the legs of the desk screeched as they scraped across the floor. My body remained rigid for a moment and I experienced a relief that can only be described as orgasmic in it's purity. My eyes rolled back in my head and my tongue lolled out of my head like a half-retarded dog and I emitted a low, sustained groan that grew in pitch as the filthy torrent pushed its way out of my body. Tremors wracked my body and I must have looked like a fish out of water with an endless stream of s*** firing out of its ass. Other sounds and sensations started to filter in now as my consciousness began to materialize once more. The muffled scream of a dungeon filled with prisoners near death radiated from my stomach, the rushing sound of litres of liquid trying to escape through an aperture too small to accommodate it all at the same time, the omnipresent sound of chunky liquid spattering against a hard surface with great force, the high-pitched screaming of a woman's voice calling out to God, another voice sobbing uncontrollably imploring to ""make it stop!!!"" and my own ecstatic, monotone wail.

When my ordeal had eventually run its course, I was left panting for breath and wobbly legged, half-crying, half-laughing with relief, barely lucid and feeling as if I had birthed an elephant. My colon felt like someone had poured chile sauce all over it and then sent in a colony of fire ants to eat it. Through my sobs I heard the sound of dripping, like when the sprinklers are eventually turned off after an office fire, or after a thunderstorm when the willow that overhangs a pond continues to rain down long after the sky has stopped. From behind me, the sobbing continued and I heard someone trying to speak into a walkie-talkie but nonsensical words were all that the man could speak, which sounded like the ravings of a lunatic.

With great relief, I slowly pulled myself off the table, legs trembling, my stomach eliciting one last sound, a loud prolonged gas bubbling that eerily resembled a pig orgasm. I slowly turned my head to survey the devastation and in that instant, if I had had a pencil or some other sharp object, I probably would have gouged my eyes out in revulsion. And the smell. The smell was enough to drive a man insane. It was the stench of rotting potatoes mixed with sulphur and ammonia, cooked in a broth of chicken feces and left to age for two weeks in a yeasty stew at the bottom of a French outhouse. After half a whiff of this ghoulish brine, I immediately stopped breathing through my nose but the taste was to remain in the back of my throat for months to come.

The young agent had taken the brunt of the foul witch's brew, and at first I couldn't process what I was seeing. I thought somehow the young blond kid had been spirited away and replaced by a brown Golem, or a ATV rider that had spent the better part of a day driving through every mud puddle he could find after a torrential downpour. With some degree of compartmentalization I came to understand that for some unfathomable reason this kid hadn't moved - or hadn't been able to move - through the entire fecal deluge. He had weathered the entire assault head-on like some sort of hero from Greek Mythology. I had given this poor schmuck a one-man s*** bukkake that would make a Brazillian pornographer retch with disgust, and he was still in the same position he must have been from the moment of first impact. I tried to comprehend how he must be feeling, what he must be going through psychologically, but it became evident very quickly that he had become very broken. No doubt forced so deeply within himself once the firehose has been turned on that there was little to no hope of him ever coming back from it, certainly not without extensive psychotherapy or a lobotomy. I looked beyond his quivering, catatonic crouched form to see a perfect outline of him cutout on the white wall behind him, either side filled in with a dripping, opaque layer of alternately pulpy and runny fecal stew. I noticed two quivering masses at either extremes of the room and realized they were humanoid in form, although the caterwauling that was coming from these broken creatures was just blubbering gibberish. And this was the tableau that was burnt into my mind's eye for eternity.

Needless to say, I missed my flight.

In fact the next week is a blur. I have vague recollections of an army of Hazmat clad figures looming through the brown landscape of the soiled room, the slopping sounds of rubber boats squelching in puddles of fetid detritus, uncontrollable wailing and animal-like sounds issuing from the mouths of creatures that had been traumatized beyond their capacity for being put back together, the complete loss of sensation from my waist down as I was rolled through the room on a waterproof gurney, it's wheels struggling to surf on top of the s***-soaked floor. I spent a week or so in the hospital enclosed in a well ventilated, sealed room, with suited doctor coming in on the hour to monitor my vital signs as they tried to rehydrate my body. I had apparently expelled every available drop of water from my body that was possible to sustain life without for a short period of time. All of my clothes were incinerated in the hospital's crematorium, and the soiled bag of ""Haribo Sugar Free Gummy Bears"" was never recovered.

This is my story. It is inconceivable to think that this kind of product can be sold legally and be misrepresented as 'food'. I was lucky, I survived. But as for the families of the survivors, and the survivors themselves, they will forever live with the trauma of the events that took place at Pearson International Airport on that snowy day in April 2013.",1,1740499871.0,copypasta,1,1.0,False

I feel like caffeine and any other stimulant drug like adhd amphetimine drugs like adderall are a cheat code for work. They have a leg up that someone who doesn't consume stimulants doesn't. Like I said, you become a hyper focused, fast moving machine. Yes a job like being an artist in which time is no problem and it's not about productivity on your computer but just thinking about ideas is fine without stimulants but 99% of us don't have that luxury.

Everyone I know drinks coffee, or tea, or energy drinks, or nicotine or is on a amphetimine like adderall. I'd venture to say like 95% of USA and probably the world consumes caffeine daily. When you are part of the 5% that doesn't, then you are the ""freak"" or the person who is not as fast/focused/productive.

I don't drink caffeine due to a health condition but I most likely would if I could. I did feel like less of a robot when I quit and I feel like I feel better, but I'd rather not get fired or not get promoted or a raise because all of my coworkers are using this cheat code. Yes I know there are other aspects I can focus on like being a nice personable person, or coming up with out of the box ideas or whatever other skills you can think of, but let's face it - so much of work is repetitive robotic tasks - whether you're on a computer program or delivering packages or fixing car engines or making calls.

He told me I'm stained with evil.,"The man shoved past me, and the sticky slime of his being clung to my arm. I swiped at it, tried to shake it off. But it was stubborn. It stuck, stained my skin.

I had to get it off me.

I hurried on, left hand still swiping intermittently over the spot on my right arm where he touched me.

His energy was on me. I could feel it. His bitterness, his resentment towards the world. It had an acrid, bitter scent that cloyed my nose.

I rounded a corner, and found an empty doorway in front of a closed shop. I leant against the wall, and shut my eyes. I imagined a bright white light shining down from above, into the top of my head. I imagined the light filling my body, hitting the contaminated spot, and beginning to burn the taint off.

“Excuse me,” someone said. Shit.

I opened my eyes, ritual disrupted. A woman stood before me, gesturing at the door next to me.

“I need to get in,” she said.

“It’s closed.”

“I know. It’s my shop. I’m opening it.”

“Oh. Sorry.” I walked off. I had to find a quiet spot to do the ritual.

“Joey!” someone called. I turned out of habit, and cursed.

It was Zoe from work.

“I thought I saw you a street down. Had to pretty much run after you. Why’re you in such a hurry?”

Zoe’s a nice person. Chatty, cheerful, not a mean bone in her body. But I wasn’t in the mood to chat. I needed to cleanse the stain from me.

“Ah, just…really need to use the loo. Looking for one. You know of any around here?”

She giggled. “Oh, shit, okay. There’s should be one in that cafe over there.”

“Do I have to buy stuff?”

“I was gonna get coffee anyway, I’ll go with you, you go ahead.”

“You sure?” I asked, already headed towards where she pointed.

“Yeah. Go, go.”

I completed the entire routine in the loo. I didn’t care if she thought I was taking too long. It could be number 2.

She was there, sipping her coffee, when I came out, all cleansed. Basking in the relief of the clean glow about me, I felt a rush of affection when I saw her.

“Thanks, Zoe. You’re a lifesaver.”

She chortled. “Hardly. What you up to, anyway?”

“Just shopping for the boss. His birthday’s on Monday, you know that? Everyone gets him gifts, so I feel like we’ve got to.”

“Oh, me too! Someone told me gifts are kinda expected. Which is…weird, in my opinion. But he’s the boss! Wanna shop together? I could pick your brain about what to get for him.”

Zoe was fairly new at our company.

I nodded. She had very good vibes. Her energy was great. I didn’t have to worry about being tainted by her.

She ended up being more helpful than I was. She might be newer, but she seemed to know things about everyone in the team. Their likes, dislikes, pets, partners, things like that. She definitely knew more about our boss than I did. It made my shopping a lot easier.

We parted at the train station, and I was in a pretty good mood as I walked the short ten minutes home.

Until some asshole taking up the entire pathway walked straight into me, despite my attempts to edge to the sides as much as I could.

This guy’s energy was different from the previous one’s. It was full of obnoxious entitlement, a rather sad need to feel like a big man. It was no less gross than the previous one, though.

I swiped at my shoulder and arm, where he had hit. I could smell the stink of his energy, already picture the stain forming on my skin beneath my clothes.

I nearly ran to my apartment. I was fumbling with the lock when it unlocked from the inside, and the door opened.

“Ew,” was my brother’s greeting. “You smell off. And that aura. Yikes.”

“I know. Some asshole, just outside.”

“They got you on the shoulder, didn’t they? I can see it from here. It’s bad, some frothing gray mess of-”

“Entitlement and tiny D syndrome, I know.”

“There’s a floral scent about you though, a tinge of some pretty awesome vibes.”

“Met my colleague. That’s probably her.”

I showered, while imagining bright light washing away the bad vibes stuck on my skin. Once I felt clean, I got dressed and set up dinner.

“It was your turn to cook, dude,” I complained half-heartedly.

“Sorry,” he said, with no explanation.

I sighed, and microwaved our dinners.

Lee had always been able to see vibes. I know, woo-woo, right? But it’s true. He could always see when I had been touched, brushed by, or near an asshole. Or a particularly kind person. He even knew where I had been touched.

It’s been a problem for me for a long time. Not his sixth sense, but my own sensitivity to the energy of others.

I saw someone for it when I was young. They told me it was a form of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Mental contamination obsessions, they told me. That my belief that others could mentally contaminate me with their energy, their essence, was an obsession. That my ritual of invoking a cleansing light in meditation was a compulsion.

I wanted to believe they were right. That it was nothing but OCD. But my brother could always see the energy. When I told them that, they wanted to examine my brother. Said something about delusions, hallucinations.

So I never went back.

We’ve both gotten used to it. We don’t know what’s happening, exactly, but it’s all we’ve ever known since we were young. Our parents had treated it like some quirk of ours, “woo-woo talk”’, and tended to cope by ignoring all topics of energies and auras. As we grew older, they grew more fearful of us. The way we knew things that we shouldn’t have, through the energies and remnant stains we could see. Anyway, they died when we turned 18 and 20. I sometimes wondered if they had engineered the accident, to get away from us.

The rest of the weekend passed in a haze of mundane mucking about. When Monday came, I grabbed the gift and headed out.

Almost immediately, I nearly collided with someone. He stopped, shifted to one side, and gestured with an exaggerated sweeping motion of his arm for me to go ahead.

“Thank you,” I said, smiling out of habit. But my smile curdled in a moment. A wave of dread rippled into my skin.

I froze for a moment, then made myself walk on.

I had never felt anything that sinister, that evil before. I hadn’t even touched the guy, but whatever he was emanating had clung onto my every pore, melting into my skin, my flesh. His stench was strong. It wasn’t the usual mix of bitterness and assholery. His was a sickly sweet, heavily perfumed, yet unmistakable venomous scent.

I bit my lip to keep from gasping. I didn’t want to attract any more attention from the guy than I already had. I snuck a look back, and nearly shrieked. He was staring straight at me, his lips peeled back, teeth bared. A nightmarish rendition of a smile. I turned away and hurried down the street to the train station.

On the train, I closed my eyes and frantically pictured the flow of light from above. But this time, no matter how hard I concentrated, how bright I made the light, the stink wouldn’t leave, the stain on my every pore wouldn’t dissipate.

I was nauseated. It felt like I had ingested a tub of gooey, viscous evil.

Someone gave up their seat for me and I realised I was breaking out in dribbles of cold sweat. I must have looked really ill.

I thanked them, and sat down. I meditated hard, on that train ride.

I went to work, sat through meetings, sang happy birthday with the team, gave the boss my present, and still, the terrible bile of that person was wrapped tight around me.

Zoe asked if I was okay at some point. I told her I was coming down with the flu. They made me go home early. My brother wasn’t home when I stumbled in. I took a long hot shower, scrubbed until my skin was raw.

The stains stayed. They had morphed into a dark reddish colour, like birth marks littered all over my body. Tainted, contaminated. I couldn’t rid my skin of the molecules of evil.

Who the fuck was that guy? How fucked up was he to produce such a terrible energy?

I unlocked my cupboard of crystals. In all my admittedly short life so far, I had never needed these crystals more than a handful of times. And most of those were when I was younger, and hadn’t developed a strong ability to rely on mental rituals to cleanse myself.

But never had any aura been this bad.

I surrounded myself with the crystals, played music of a certain frequency, and meditated.

I was still meditating when my brother came home.

“Oh shit,” were his first words when he saw me. Was that fear etched on his face?

He sat opposite me, clearing a space among the crystals.

“You’re…” he trailed off, staring at me with horrified fascination. “Oh shit. That’s some crazy evil vibes. Shit, it’s all over you. Did you hug this dude or what?”

“No. I didn’t touch him. Just walked by him.”

He sucked in a breath. “Shit. Fuck. Wow.”

“Stop it, I’m trying to cleanse myself.”

“It’s not working,” he said.

“Shut up.”

“Jo, that purplish shit is all over you. That’s…that’s some demonic level shit. We need to sort this out.”

“I know. I’m trying.”

“Not like that. We need something stronger.”

“Like what?”

He shrugged helplessly.

“‘Oh, real helpful. Shut up and leave me alone.”

I meditated. I could hear my brother pacing around the house, occasionally going to his computer and typing furiously. But he let me be, even took out some of his own protective amulets to place around me. I meditated for so long, I thought I would pass out.

In fact, I think I did. I woke up the next day, and found myself sprawled on the floor, covered by a blanket. I felt sick. I ran to the toilet and heaved. Bile came out, with yesterday’s birthday cake and lunch. I didn’t even get to eat dinner.

I flushed, and stood up. I almost fell back down. Everything was woozy. The reddish bruises had darkened, spread.

I called off work, before I saw my brother’s message.

“Looking out for what we can do. We’ll sort this out.”

It didn’t make me feel any better.

By midday, I went to the doctor. I was getting a high fever.

The doctors didn’t know what was wrong. They couldn’t see the stains all over me, but they could see I was in a bad way. They concluded that I had overworked myself, and was suffering from some sort of exhaustion issue, maybe also coming down with something. They sent me home with medication, told me to check back in if I didn’t get better in a few days.

The medication didn’t help. A few days in, all I felt was wretched. I was weak, barely able to move.

My brother kept trying to find ways to help. He got people with incredibly great energy to come over, hang out. Their energy didn’t help. Zoe visited. Her bright, bubbly aura did nothing for me as well. My brother called over an exorcist, an energy master, a self-proclaimed good witch, but nothing helped.

A medium came over, took one look at me, crossed herself, and told me I needed someone more powerful. She gave us a contact.

The moment the supposedly more powerful medium came in, I knew something was wrong. Her face was pale, and there was a shell shocked look on her face.

“Outside,” she uttered without any preamble.

“Sorry what?” My brother asked. I was too weak to speak.

“Man with horrible aura. Demon. Outside.”

“What?”

The woman placed a hand on the wall for support.

“Hold up, I’ll get you some water.”

When the woman had settled on the couch and downed a cold glass of water, she was finally able to string a full sentence together.

“There’s a man lurking outside your apartment building. His energy. It’s horrible. I don’t…I don’t think he’s even human,” she said, her voice tapering into a whisper.

“Huh?”

“Was he…was he in a suit? Dark grey, rather old fashioned looking?”

Her eyes widened.

“So it was him you ran into.”

“Yes,” I said, and had to stop to take a breath.

“Oh dear. I’m sorry. He’s a dark, powerfully dark force. I don’t know if I can help.

“Hey, you’ve got to help. Look at her,” my brother said, pointing at me, “she’s half dead.”

“Speak for yourself,” I managed.

“I…I can do a cleansing ritual. My most powerful one. All the most powerful ones. I just hope that’s enough.”

“Is that fucker still outside?” My brother asked, rolling up his sleeves.

“Don’t,” the medium said firmly. “Trust me, young man.”

“You’re more sensitive than I am, Lee. Don’t go out there,” I added for good measure.

Lee rolled his sleeves back down.

“Fine. But do the rituals. What do you need?”

“I’ve everything I need here,” the medium said, pointing to her bag. “I’ll just need your help with setting up.

Three rituals later, I thought I felt better. I wasn’t sure if it was a placebo effect, or if it really worked. But I had a mite more energy, and the cold sweat stopped. The stains stopped growing. Stopped deepening in intensity.

We paid the medium, and tried to tip her, but she refused our tip.

“You’ve enough to deal with,” was her response.

My brother walked her to the apartment lobby. She felt unsafe leaving alone with that strange man possibly still lurking outside. She made him promise he wouldn’t leave the building, wouldn’t confront the man, and he grudgingly agreed.

When my brother came back, I knew he hadn’t kept his word.

He was paler than I was.

“Are you okay? You went out, didn’t you?”

He didn’t react. He looked like a zombie that had been run over and sewn together twice. The life seemed to have leached out of him. He was dark in areas, grey mush dripping off his skin. Grey mush that reeked of that sickly, cloying scent. Grey mush that I knew not everyone could see. Grey mush I knew would slowly turn red.

“Oh god, don’t tell me you confronted him. You didn’t, did you?”

He ignored all my questions, went straight to his room and locked the door.

I knocked for a while, calling out to him. I was frantic, but I was still really weak. When I had sapped all my energy trying to get him to open the door, I gave up and went to bed. Hopefully he would feel better the next day, and be able to tell me what happened.

When I woke up the next day, I felt significantly better. The stains seemed to have receded a little. Or maybe it was my wishful thinking. At least, I felt like I could breathe right.

Despite that, I knew something was wrong. Lee hadn’t woken me up with his fussing. He’s a lazy brother, but when I’m unwell, he’s quite the caretaker and fusser.

“Lee?” I went to his room. The door was locked still.

“Lee?” I called again. I banged on the door, rattled the knob.

“Lee, wake up! Or I’m calling the ambulance! Or the police!”

I yelled for a long time, but there was complete silence on the other end.

Then I smelt it. A gruesomely saccharine, nauseating odour.

It was coming from the front door.

I grabbed a knife from the kitchen, and crept up to the door. I didn’t want whoever was there to know I was at the door. I feared they would shoot through the door or something crazy like that.

Holding my breath, I silently slid the keyhole cover up. Still holding my breath, I leant forward and carefully placed my eye at the keyhole.

It was all dark outside. Even though it was day time and my corridor was usually lit.

I stared into the darkness, trying to make out where the person could be. I could smell him. The same overwhelming perfumed sickness.

I looked at the gap beneath my door. Light was streaming in from outside, and I could see a pair of feet. I stared back into the keyhole at the blackness outside.

It hit me then, and I stumbled back with a shriek.

He was looking in the keyhole from the outside.

“Fuck, fuckitty fuckity fucknuts,” I swore, scurrying far from the door, still clutching my knife.

“Get away from here! I’m calling the police!” I yelled.

“Don’t you want to save your brother?” came the voice outside. He spoke in a singsong tone of voice, which grated my already taut nerves.

“What the fuck did you do to him?” .

“Nothing. He did it to himself.”

“What the fuck did you do?” I yelled again, voice breaking a little.

“He’s an interesting one. He sees so clearly. Such fine, delicate senses. You, I could tell you were sensitive. That you knew. But him? He’s a real talent.”

I didn’t bother to repeat my question. I headed to the kitchen to grab another knife.

I would throw one right at him, stab him with the other, if he dared try to break in.

Then I came to my senses and picked up my phone instead. I dialled.

Before the police operator could respond, my phone went dead.

“Now now, if you call the police, I won’t be able to help your brother. Let me in, and I’ll help him. I don’t want a talent like him to die. I wouldn’t hurt you either. Why, I enjoy it when people can tell what I am.”

“And what the fuck are you?” “You can’t tell? See into my mind, girl. I know you can. Come on, try harder.”

Tears were flowing by this point. I wiped them roughly with my arm, then dropped my phone and picked up the knives.

“Knives won’t do much to hurt me,” came the voice.

Fuck. He could see me. Somehow.

“Won’t stop me from trying,” I yelled.

“It won’t hurt me. Look into my mind. You’ll see.”

Despite my better judgement, I gave in to the sadistic curiosity that was eating away at me.

I stared at the doorway, and pictured the man. I let myself take in a full breath of his stench.

The same darkness swarmed about me. The stomach churning evil. It was turning my insides out.

I was covered in the goop of that clinging evil, just from being a few metres away from him.

Images flashed into mind.

He was tearing a woman apart. Gripped her by the shoulder with one hand, the arm on the other side with his other hand. He tugged, a quick, confident jerk, and she flew apart, split diagonally into two. Viscera and blood erupted from within, covering his smiling face.

Someone attacked him from behind. A knife thudded into him. He smiled wider, and pulled out the knife. He flung it back at the man who had thrown it, and it sank fully to the hilt into the man’s forehead. The man fell over.

I gagged, retched.

“You sick fuck.”

“Just doing my dailies. No biggy. Now, will you open this door, or not?”

“No. Fuck off!”

“Sure. Say goodbye to your brother, all right?” He half sang the words like he was singing a goodbye song.

The stench eased. He must have left. I ran to my brother’s room, and rattled the handle.

This time, it opened. What the fuck.

I rushed in, and saw an unmoving lump under the covers.

Dread thickening in my veins, I lifted the blanket.

Lee was grey and red all over. He had soaked the sheets with his perspiration. He looked…lifeless.

I checked for a breath. I couldn’t be sure if there was one. I checked his pulse. There it was. A faint, barely there beat.

I rushed to his phone. Thank god it was working. I didn’t bother to unlock it, just dialled for an ambulance.

The doctors at the hospital didn’t have much to say. They didn’t know what was wrong. They were running all the tests, and they hoped they’d find something soon. Lee had slipped into a coma.

Fuck.

I stayed in the hospital for the night, begging Lee to wake up. I rushed home to get the ingredients the medium had left us, and carried out the rituals that the medium had taught us. The doctors were reluctant, but I quoted religious and spiritual practices, and they had to let me do it. I did the ritual all through the night. I couldn’t get through to the medium. Nothing changed. The red stains merely burned darker on his skin.

I kept trying, anyway. In the morning, I went home to pack his clothes and necessities.

That fucking stench was there again. It hit me one I neared the door.

Every sense tingling, I crept closer to the door. Then stopped, and did the nonstupid thing. I called the cops.

This time, my phone worked, and the cops arrived quickly.

They searched, but no one was there. They couldn’t smell anything, none of the stench. They looked at me like I was crazy, but when I mentioned the man waiting outside my apartment and loitering around the building before, they paid more attention. They took notes, details, and promised to look into it.

“No surveillance? No protective detail?” I asked.

“No, not for something that’s not concrete. Sorry, limited manpower.”

I kind of expected that answer, but I couldn’t resist a scoff.

Once the police had left, I saw it. I don’t know how no one spotted it before, when the police were here.

A note, on the ground before the door. How had we missed it? Did it just get slid in?

With a trembling hand, I picked it up.

'Poor Lee, dying because his sister wouldn’t open the door. Don’t worry, I’ll come again soon. Open the door, let’s make a deal.'

The hospital called right after I read the note. Lee was in critical condition. They were trying to save his life in intensive care. It was all touch and go, they said.

I felt the life drain out of me. I began to shake, cold sweat beading up once again.

Lee’s the only family I have left. I know that man can’t be up to anything good. He can’t possibly be sincere about helping.

But he‘s the only shot I have. The only one who might be able to save Lee.

It didn’t take long for him to show up. That cloying, stinking scent. He’s still at the door.

I’m doing what I can to postpone the inevitable. Writing this. Burning sage.

But he keeps calling. “I’m here, open the door.” “Don’t you want to save Lee?”

My stains are spreading. I can feel myself fading.

I think I might let him in[.](http://reddit.com/r/thedarkseas)",1,1740499645.0,nosleep,0,0.67,False

1ixyio0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ixyio0/unpopular_opinion/,Unpopular opinion,"Kenya will never become truly wealthy by relying on coffee, tea, textiles, pyrethrum, and horticulture—no matter how well-managed these sectors are. Yes, they are labor-intensive, but in terms of revenue, they generate very little. Even if these industries were to bring in KSh 1 trillion annually, that’s barely enough to sustain a nation of 50 million people. At best, we’d be stuck in survival mode, with a per capita income that struggles to outpace inflation.

For Kenya to achieve real prosperity, we must move beyond primary/extractive industries and into true manufacturing—not just assembly line work. We need to transform raw materials into high-value products: take steel and turn it into tractors, copper into vacuum cleaners, reagents into cancer medication. That’s how real wealth is built.

Tourism also has untapped potential. Yes, 2.4 million annual tourists might sound impressive, but in reality, those are rookie numbers. We should be aiming for 12 million visitors per year. And let’s be honest—safari tourism alone won’t get us there. We need to diversify and modernize our tourism offerings.

The ICT sector is promising, but much of it seems focused on solving first-world problems. Do we really need more food delivery apps? How many Kenyans can even afford such services, and how scalable are they in our market? Instead of replicating Silicon Valley trends, we should be developing tech solutions tailored to our unique challenges and economic landscape.

Kenya’s path to wealth lies in industrialization, innovation, and scaling up industries that create real economic value. Otherwise, we risk being stuck in a cycle of low-income survival.

Autonomous AI shopping agents are stepping into the spotlight, ready to shop 'til we drop—our jaws, at least. Picture this: AI not only browsing the virtual aisles for you but also deciding what goes into your cart, potentially without you even lifting a finger. It's the future of shopping, and it's closer than you think.

**From Chatty Bots to Busy Buyers**

In the brave new world of AI, the evolution from chatty customer service bots to sophisticated shopping agents marks a seismic shift. Sure, predictive AI told us what we might like, and generative AI created that catchy product description. But now, agentic AI is stepping up, making decisions and completing purchases, wielding its digital power while you sip your coffee.

According to a joint report by Salesforce and Accenture, AI shopping agents are already being embedded into operations across consumer goods companies. Remember the days when you'd battle with automated phone systems? Well, now imagine those systems on steroids, now adeptly managing your shopping experiences from start to finish without missing a beat.

**Welcome to the Agentic Age**

Brands like Saks are embracing this new frontier, leveraging platforms like Salesforce’s “Agentforce.” These tools go beyond recommending products—they engage akin to your favorite human stylist but with the efficiency of a supercomputer, armed with your preferences, sizes, and even your penchant for returns and exchanges.

For retail media networks, the implications are nothing short of revolutionary. Instead of elbowing for consumer eyeballs, brands might soon focus on algorithm optimization, ensuring their products meet agents' criteria rather than just a catchy ad campaign.

**Is Skepticism on Sale?**

Of course, not everything is smooth sailing. With great AI comes great responsibility—and skepticism. Trust is a looming issue. Can consumers be confident in decisions made by a shopping agent? And how do businesses ensure the AI's recommendations align with their brand values, or, more importantly, common sense?

**Preparing for an AI-Coordinated Reality**

As AI continues its unyielding march into our shopping habits, brands and retailers must adapt their strategies and infrastructures. Failing to do so might leave them as obsolete as last season's trends. But those who do will find themselves not just surviving, but thriving in this agentic era.

So, what do you think, dear reader? Are you ready to hand over your shopping list to an AI—or do you prefer to keep your cart close and your shopping decisions closer? Let's hear your thoughts!",1,1740499567.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

1ixyf52,https://www.reddit.com/r/AiKilledMyStartUp/comments/1ixyf52/ais_alchemy_revolutionizing_chemistry_with_a/,AI's Alchemy: Revolutionizing Chemistry with a High-Tech Twist,"AI is revolutionizing the chemicals industry—and it's not just for concocting the next big adhesive for your coffee mug handle. In a twist that could make even Walter White raise an eyebrow, AI is the mastermind behind more efficient, innovative, and environmentally friendly chemical processes. From discovery to production, AI is the Michelin chef in an industry kitchen where the recipe for fearsome efficiency and stunning sustainability is constantly being refined.

**AI: The Head Chef in the Chemical Laboratory**

Not long ago, the arduous journey from concept to market-ready chemical compound was akin to creating a hand-knitted sweater with no pattern—tedious and fraught with error. Enter AI: the interventionist technology that makes chemical innovation look like a cakewalk. By deploying machine learning algorithms, AI tools sift through colossal datasets, identifying promising compounds in mere moments. It's like having thousands of junior scientists all hyper-focused on the task while never needing a coffee break.

AI also flexes its predictive muscle by simulating chemical reactions and forecasting outcomes with breathtaking accuracy. It's reducing the costly and time-consuming need for physical testing—essentially replacing the lab coat with a virtual reality headset.

**Production Processes: No Room for Chemistry 101 Here**

On the factory floor, AI elevates production from Shakespearean drama to something more predictable and precise—say, a well-oiled ticker tape parade. With real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance, AI ensures that every cog in the chemical production machine turns smoothly. It’s akin to having a chess grandmaster playing 15 games at once, never missing a move—only here, every miscalculation potentially saves millions.

**Why AI in Chemicals Spellbinds Investors**

The irresistible pull of reducing costs and driving efficiency has manufacturers cozying up to AI like bees to a particularly enticing hive. The industry pressure to optimize and reduce waste is relentless, and AI’s predictive analytics is the secret sauce transforming clunky operations into streamlined, economical powerhouses.

And in our climate-conscious era, AI isn't just raising profits but moral standards too—highlighting pathways to reduce emissions and upcycle waste. This means AI is not only handing the chemicals industry a golden spanner but also a compass pointing toward sustainable practices.

So, can AI continue to challenge the conventional while beckoning in an epoch of eco-friendly chemicals production? 🤔 Share your thoughts on how AI has revolutionized your industry experiences or speculate on what's next for this dynamic duo.",1,1740499351.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

Context: My(20M) gf(20F) and I are together (LDR) for 2  years na. Sa start pa lang ng relatioship namin, sinabihan niya na ako na matampuhin siya. I was okay with that naman. All througout our relationship, never ko siya hinayaan na nagtatampo. There were no weeks na walang tampuhan. Kung nagtatampo siya, sinusuyo ko kaagad. I always say na always valid yung nararamdaman niya, because that's how she feels on a certain situation, and I don't blame her naman for that. 

There was a certain time na exam week namin, and I had to pull an all nighter sa coffee shops every other day kasi need ko mag aral. Nagpapaalam naman ako sa kaniya palagi. However, everytime na mag a-allnighter ako sa coffee shop, nagtatampo siya kasi di raw makapag vc at usap. So instead of reviewing naubos yung time ko sa pagsuyo sa kaniya. So in the end I flunked my exams non.

Ngayon, the same situation ulit, and napapagod na ako manuyo. Hindi na ako lumabas ng bahay para kahit nagaaral ako is mag ka video call kami. Pero ayaw din niya. I feel like ubos na ubos na ako para manuyo.  Nag aral ako for 10 hours, tapos gusto ko lang din naman sana magpahinga sa kaniya pero I can't do that kasi kailangan ko pa manuyo. Unti unti na ako napapagod sa kaniya.

1ixyebh,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1ixyebh/theories_i_need_help_with_kier_pe_sleep_motives/,"Theories I need help with (Kier, PE - sleep - motives)","I started watching Severance last week, I’m late to the game but knew I would love the show and instantly have a million questions and thoughts surrounding this. I’ve been doing a deep dive into theories and please correct me if I missed a relevant thread, but here are some theories/thoughts swimming inside my mind. 

1. Kier, PE
I was thinking about the PE as initials. Maybe it stands for Phillip Eagan? If so, is it linked to reality or perceived reality? Thinking Phillip also has the ties to Pips in town. Maybe there’s a town or ‘space’ for all of the Eagans or possibly he’s the Eagan who got Severance right. He was CEO/Alive till 1999, Fields claims Burt has been working at Lumon for 20 years and Mark’s license places the show around 2020, I’m no math person, but kinda lines up?

2. Sleep 
With the emphasis on Mark getting sleep, Harmony’s overall proximity, and the blur between reality when drifting off… is it possible severance has more to do with the person being asleep? Perhaps Mark is somewhere else when he’s sleeping, another severed or unsevered layer? The opening sequence from season 1 had a lot of sleep and possibly coffee overlaps, so sleep must be important.

3. Medical Facility
Maybe Lumon has these medical facilities and is treating patients in the “real” world. Maybe Mark was also injured in this car wreck that involved Gemma. Perhaps this is the only way he can access memories and tame his tempers. Maybe that’s why inside feels like outside and outside could still be inside? Maybe this is the only way his family can visit him and the book Ricken wrote is to help develop his consciousness. (Black Mirror Fans Spoiler: think San Junipero but more sinister).

4. Lumon motives
“I was ME till you gave me YOU.” Maybe this principle has to do with the beehive function. Severance clearly equipped these people with more functions than they currently use, like OTC. Maybe Kier or the Eagans plan to live on inside the collective consciousness of their “followers”. (Think Being John Malcovich style). Maybe revolving has to do with who’s consciousness has the lead or which person is hosting the collective board or Eagan consciousness. 

5. Trap
Perhaps Gemma was a construct and setup to get Mark to eventually sever himself. Milchick brought up how Mark even talked about it in his interview. Seems oddly convenient. Same with Burt and Fields seeing the service at church about severance after discussing heaven/hell. Just like in the office, seems like the folks in town are being watched and preyed upon.

6. Burt and Irving
“Maybe love transcends severance.” Love this quote by Dylan. Thinking these guys go way back, probably 20 some years as Fields mentioned. Perhaps while in the navy, Irving was coerced into participating in Lumon related trials. Maybe Burt was testing him and that’s how they met. Burt obviously wouldn’t want him to know all this if Severance was still in a testing mode and they had to do a cover up and so the “clean slate” functions was used to hide the truth. Maybe it turned into a love story he has to erase their love to keep Fields in his life. Maybe they were both erased to avoid office relationships. Either way, I’m convinced Burt has been on this project for a while and his sins have something to do with his work.

Can’t wait to get more pieces of this puzzle! Let me know if I should keep digging down any of my rabbit holes.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Then, disaster struck. In a moment of overenthusiastic multitasking, I accidentally shared my entire browser instead of just the presentation window.

Thumbnails of...*ahem*...for the purpose of this story shall we say ""cows""—*so many cows*—all in various states of being milked. To continue the analogy...industrial setups, pastoral scenes, vintage dairy ads. And then, just as quickly as it had appeared, it was gone.

Silence.

No one said anything. No awkward coughs, no stifled laughter. The meeting continued as if nothing had happened. My heart pounded. Maybe no one noticed? Maybe the flicker was too fast?

I powered through the rest of the presentation, logged off, and sat there, face burning, convincing myself I was in the clear. Hours passed. No emails, no Slack messages, no subtle digs. Relief started to creep in.

Then, as I was leaving for the day, a colleague strolled past my desk, casually stirring their coffee.

“Nice presentation,” they said. Then, after a perfectly timed sip, they added—

“By the way… I take mine black. Never been much for *cream*.”

The trip started out as excitement as this was my first trip to Mexico. But I’d heard great things about Mexico my mom usually goes every year around the exact timeframe, my sister who travelled with me had already been to Mexico 3 times this year alone but usually is one of the places she travels to annually as well. 

We were going to attend a wedding, We were going to get sister bonding time in, I was going to get a little break from the daily life of a single mother to a higher needs child what could go wrong, right?

The flight was a little longer than expected and because of my excitement the night before I was packing and repacking my bag all night and prepping to leave my little one in the care of mother while away, so I was exhausted by the time we arrived to the resort. 

The Bride had motion sickness from the plane ride, at this point while embarking on our bus transportation she already knew she maybe more nausea from the smell of gas and motion. Her future husband at the time requested a bucket from the bus driver letting him know of the situation and the bus driver in case she got sick, it wasn’t until later we found the bus driver had charged him for the bucket.

The bus driver had locked us in the bus when they went to unload the bags, the bride who is pregnant was begging to be left off the bus as she was suffering from motion sickness and the smell of the gas. Some of our group tried to get the door open for her to let her off but we all had to wait until he returned. After disembarking they wouldn’t allow us to grab our bags. If they are offering to help us carry our bags to the room fine but have the front desk make the offer and allow us to still keep our bags near, or if you keep the bags have someone attending and watching them after the bus left, the workers left them there for a while and came back. 

When checking in they gave us a form to sign and my sister didn’t want to sign anything not in English. They said oh sorry there’s supposed to be an English part of it. She didn’t bring a English copy nor even attempted to look for another copy in English. My sister wouldn’t sign unless it was at least translated.

Some people were charged for a deposit some not. No direction at all about available activities, what direction our room is in, what we have access to and don’t have access to, nothing but poor quality customer service.

After we returned to the entrance they just automatically took our bags without asking if we wanted help in even bringing our bags. And was about to start loading our bags when we asked when we would we’d get our bags they said it would be quite a while. That’s when someone in our group asked where our rooms were, they informed us it’s just one floor up from the lobby elevator to the right. We thought ok there’s no point in getting them to bring our bags majority of us are still in our winter clothes from leaving -40 weather, we definitely did not want to wait to change into lighter clothing. So we just said we’d take our bags… it would have been a nice heads up to know our suites we were assigned is on a second floor…. With a building that has no working elevator. Still we hauled our bags there so we carried on to haul our bags up the flight of stairs me personally praying I don’t re-injure an old back injury to the point I wouldn’t be able to walk and enjoy anything on this vacation. 
We get to the room and quickly inspect our room just doing the regular inspections of bed  bugs, checking to see if things look clean enough to use safely. The only thing I can tell was the tub didn’t seem thoroughly clean, and there was mold on the curtains. Not the biggest deal, we plan to be busy any way not in the room. 

A lot of members met in the lobby. On our way to lobby we see the bride, groom and her family at the check-in desk. we thought is was weird that they were still checking in. Nope they gave the bride and groom and their child an room that was not up to par and needed to have repairs. Other members were given a room that already had guests staying in a room so the resort had no rooms for them now, and placed their grandparents in a room that was inaccessible due to the stairs and no elevator and they had requested a ground level floor for them over a year ago when booking the wedding. So it was already a bumpy start for everyone.
But hey we haven’t eaten in hours so we’re starving so we’ve headed to the buffet. 
Somethings were okay, somethings were awful, whatever resort food is usually known for hit or miss in some places. The brides daughter was going and grabbing things with adults in the group in kinda of a rotation whenever she wanted to go try something. Well when I went to go it’s about 30 minutes until the buffet closes she wanted ice cream so we went to go get some. There are two machines, we tried the first one it wasn’t working ok fine we’ll go the next one and right as we are about to pull the handle one a hotel staff had pulled up at the same time and shut the machine off right in front of her face. Honestly I kinda was just too tired to make an so I’d just asked if he was turning it back on, when told no. I just told her we’ll get ice cream tomorrow. We did return to the others still a little irritated though that they couldn’t even wait a couple more minutes for her to get ice cream. 

The next day we’re all headed for our first drink in the afternoon and when ordering told we couldn’t order at that bar it’s only for those with black or platinum bracelets. Okay fine we’re not ignorant to timeshares having some exclusivity. (But this continued even in non-black and platinum areas. I have never heard of such lack of activities and areas for a all inclusive resort. Activities are only in adult only sections, can’t go there, can’t play sports on the courts, can’t use adults only pools (honestly when I think of adult only I didn’t once think that was an inclusive only to a premium status either. I just thought if a parent wanted to step out the family scene to get time away they have that option.))

It’s still our second day in, I’m offered to take their tour to upgrade our passes to allow access to adult only pools, we’ve booked for the Mexican restaurant. Other than the restrictions things seemed to be going good. 
I ordered the cheese and chorizo appetizer took one bite my stomach already starts rolling, I push it away waiting for the entree I ordered beef fajita, I like fajitas, nope my stomach was revolting from the appetizer I’m struggling to eat anything now. 
Welp within a couple hours of eating at the restaurant I’m feeling bad stomach cramps and we’re at the disco I have a drink and next thing I know I’m running to the bathroom trying to keep it in and throwing up in the disco. I did feel a smidge better a couple hours after emptying my stomach. But of course it would the only thing I had that day other than drinks  was the Mexican restaurant food and that was only a couple bites. Anytime I tried to look for food I hadn’t made the timelines to their buffets from sleeping in. 

The next day I’m feeling a little sluggish and exhausted but hey we’re in Mexico try to still enjoy the day. I once again did not make the timeline for breakfast. It’s Valentine’s Day and everyone had individual plans to spend time with their significant other so I wasn’t expecting to really see anyone other than my sister which we booked for the French restaurant the day prior. But when opening the group chat we’re getting messages how multiple people in our group that joined us at the Mexican restaurant majority were all sick. We honestly thought food poisoning quickly, only the members from the same restaurant the night prior got sick? 
We continued to our reservation at the French restaurant the food was actually really good. She had the onion soup and the chicken, and I had the lobster bisque and the bass. 
Then the others in our group started dropping like flies throughout the night. By morning we’re informed the bride and groom are also sick and the wedding will need to be tentatively postponed and a doctor was being called in. At this point is when everyone started suspecting something more is happening the bride was so so careful about everything, only bottle water for everything, only sticking to fruit, and foods she’s familiar with. We knew if she’s gotten as sick as she did we knew something was very wrong.

Some of us have already started to feel a little better we’re still feeling sluggish, personally I was feeling nausea so I’m still struggling to eat enough. 

But one other couple said they were going on excursion to Xplore fuego so we decided to join. By this point my sister is worried to eat but I need at least a little bit of food or I’ll get sick from a hunger migraine. The buffet had just opened in the last half hour for lunch, so I did get some food but was only able to get one bite in per item I grabbed. My sister only grabbed a soup can’t remember what kind but it was for sure a cream base, she knew she may get a little bloating and feel a little tight as she’s lactose so she carried on. Welp by the time we’re half way through Xplore Fuego she is bent over in agony the final activity she was able to do was the zip lining I for sure thought she’d start dropping bombs of vomit down. After she’s rushing to the bathroom and crying racked in agony and spent the last hour and a half emptying her stomach in the bathroom sometimes not even making to the point she filled a quarter of the garbage can with her puke.  Honestly I didn’t even know what to do for her, we were on a excursion at this point, at least I knew at the resort I remember seeing a doctors office, also we brought medications for her symptoms. We didn’t even get back until later in the evening, that night she spent crying over the toilet and her head stuck in a garbage can. She didn’t want a doctor especially after hearing how much they charged the others who did call for one. This is also the night I had found the first cockroach in our shower. 

By morning she was still feeling pretty sick but today’s the day the wedding’s been postponed to, and she was determined to make it to support. The wedding was nice I had felt a little bit bad for the bride, she’s sick, the resort hasn’t even properly cleaned up the wedding space they had the ceremony right in front of the blue moon, there were re-usable cups laying on the ground, tree bark they could have easily picked up. Didn’t block off the area or even have a sign saying wedding in progress, so children AND adults in there wet swimwear were running across her aisle they set up tracking sand all over it as they’re running throughout the area to get to the bar. 

We noticed them setting up appetizers at the blue moon, I over hear someone ask the bride if that’s the food their prepping for the reception, she said “no that’s not we ordered for our menu”. Well it was the appetizers they were serving that they had laying out in the hot sun for about an hour and a half. Most food at the wedding wasn’t eaten, everyone was still feeling sick, plus the entree looked a little questionable. The cake though was soo good! I think I may have been one of the few that had some. Half the grooms side had left early no longer able to contain how sick they were. When the dancing started I had to step away to lie down for a bit to settle my stomach again at this point I’m my stomach is racked with pain but I’m determined to make sure they have as many people there to still make their day special. Honestly about half of us were so determined to still make this trip a good one even though we felt like shit. We went to the disco afterwards and actually were enjoying our time, the DJ was actually taking song requests this night so it was actually decent. Most nights we saw there was practically no one going to the disco unless they were grabbing a drink and leaving. But tonight there were quite a few different people.  Now we’re a pretty chatty group, so we had talked to some of the other guests including those who are on a domestic visit from Mexico,  this is where we found out that they had also been sick! Previously before we were practically being blamed it was our Canadian stomachs and were not used to the food. Well obviously now that is not the case, we are avid travellers, and obviously even their own citizens who are accustomed to the food are also getting sick. 
The next day we spent in bed the whole day exhausted, except when someone in our party made arrangements for everyone to be able to eat in town so we could finally get a proper meal in. This was also the night I had found our second cockroach in the room, this one was a little larger I slapped that thing so fast with my sandal without even thinking it through. 
Our last day some of the adults in our group is feeling better enough to enjoy sometime at the beach with minimal symptoms other than exhaustion and nausea. On our way to the beach we had made a stop at the cupcake my sister and I had both ordered a cold coffee one frappe and the other just an ice coffee. After leaving out the doors we took one sip and had to leave it, the milk was spoiled.

To summarize:

- The French restaurant was good.
- Yes the staff was nice enough but unless they are trying to rope you into their RE program they couldn’t care less… except the guy that delivered the room drink refills and water cooler replacements. He was the most friendliest person I’d met, oh and there was a bar tender at the blue moon while waiting for the wedding to start he made a special drink just to for me due to my allergies.
- They should have more respect for the weddings they are hosting and have plans in place for this. These families are investing a lot to make their wedding amazing $17,000 USD is not a small amount either so ensuring you have the section temporarily closed off is respectful.
- I’d seen cockroaches in the disco, and in our room.
- The management is very poor at addressing guests concerns. 
- They don’t provide English versions to forms you are signing so be very wary. Even though they have them.
- Room drink refills majority of the time only came every second day. 
- Cleaning was good if we left the sign for cleaning on.
- Personally I have never been somewhere guests are treated so callously.
- If you require accessibility this resort is not for you. The elevators are broken, I saw so many unfortunate elders slipping on the stairs, it was so sad. All the parents with strollers once again you’ll be needing to carry your children and your strollers down flights of stairs. The shuttles are so packed so you for sure will be walking the 15-20 min walk if you want to get anywhere. 
- I have never seen a hotel try to put so much blame solely on their guests vs. Take accountability for poor management in mitigating of a crisis. 
- They start to shut food restaurants/buffets down an hour early.
- There are no pool activities for kids, other than the water “park”.
- Find out what activities you are eligible before hand in your “all inclusive” package as you’ll find out it’s not a whole lot.
- The RE tour is not worth it, you want to tour for 3hrs to get an upgrade to “sample” the RE services but you won’t get any RE access it’s only for gold which only allows access to adults only. (I was sick the day of the tour so I’m kinda glad I didn’t waste my time now.)

I am really glad I didn’t end up bringing my autistic daughter. I wouldn’t have been able to carry the luggage, her and her disability stroller wagon! And there lucky they didn’t have to clean up projectile vomit everywhere if she’d come because if you don’t know a lot of autistic children struggle to puke in a toilet, because one they don’t have the sensor to tell them they are about to puke, and two a lot are unable to have there face bent towards a bowl, so a lot of parents have to lay something out like a towel for their child to puke on and clean it up afterwards. I thought for sure with accusations that with the resort claiming it was norovirus that we’d for sure pass it on to her, as she has an oral sensory disfunction and puts everything in her mouth or barges into the bathroom toys are left in there if a toilet was flushed as we all know without a lid on can spread spores in the air and she has a thing about watching the toilet water flush 🤦🏽‍♀️. But to this day she has not gotten sick once from this so called norovirus. At this point the only ones still sick with lingering symptoms are those solely who were at Sandos playcar. With other results coming in with parasites and E. coli I highly encourage anyone else to get tested as well.

I suspect I am just missing something simple.

I have my Artisan profile here: [https://imgur.com/a/sXABEaU](https://imgur.com/a/sXABEaU)

Roaster: Hottop 2K+

Brewing Equipment: Chemex

Brew Ratio: 500ml and 40g Coffee, Medium Coarse grind

Beans: CEPCO Oaxaca Washed Organic from Coffee Bean Corral

So I am using a Hottop 2K+ and this is my 6th ever roast. I use a Chemex for pour overs and I can say the flavor is absolutely fantastic, but I notice I never get the energy I do from commercially roasted beans and feel like I am withdrawing from caffeine, which makes me think the problem lies in my process or the beans I am using. This is despite the fact I have always used between 35 and 40g coffee to 500ml water daily. This roast had 170g of green coffee beans.

Has anyone else experienced this? Could it be that I am actually getting more caffeine from my home roasts and am experiencing a crash?

Hey there, everyone! Local Floridian here with a love of theme parks, animals, and reading. I’ve been with Fidelity for over 3 years, and when I’m not spending time here with y’all, I’m with my family or in the gym working out. I love being active, spending time outdoors, and exploring new and local places. Good food and great conversation always bring me joy! 

u/FidelityAsha 

Hey, everyone! I'm happy to be a part of this community. I'm a fitness enthusiast, avid gardener, and amateur chef who loves experimenting with new recipes. When not working or cooking, I enjoy traveling (for the food), being active outdoors with my German shepherd, and learning about disruptive technologies that may shape our future. In other words, I'm naturally curious, so keep the questions you all bring to the sub coming. Thanks for having me! 

u/FidelityJelise 

Hi everyone! I’ve been with Fidelity since December 2017. I enjoy traveling, hanging out with family and friends, and perusing r/fidelityinvestments in my free time. Most days you can catch me outside swimming, skiing, paddleboarding, zip-lining and much more. I love track and field; it's a sport I excelled at during my middle and high school years. 2024 was a year of firsts for me—I attended my first concert and first football game—two bucket list items completed, and many more to come!  

u/FidelityAllison 

Hey Reddit! I’ve been with Fidelity since 2018, and I’m currently pursuing my M.S. in Data Analytics. In my free time I tap dance and practice yoga. I frequent my local movie theater and always have a sitcom on in the background at home. I love to be under a blanket with a good snack and my elderly cats. I’m excited to be on the team! 

u/FidelitySamanthaR 

Born in Compton and now calling Texas my home, I’ve been with Fidelity since 2022. These days I’m balancing studying for my bachelor’s degree, planning my wedding, and negotiating peace treaties between my two cats and dog. When I’m not buried in my textbooks or wedding details, I love unwinding at arcades (pinball is my go-to) and hunting down the best food Texas has to offer! 

u/FidelityBrielle 

When I’m not skiing, hiking, camping, or doing something else in the Colorado mountains, I read voraciously, particularly fantasy, history, and mysteries. I also love to draw and illustrate, sometimes scenes from the fantasy war novel I’m writing. My ideal afternoon? Relaxing in a hammock by a river after a long hike, book in hand, pretending I’m in Rivendell. I’m really happy to be here helping out the community! 

u/FidelityChristina 

I start my morning with black and green—a strong cup of coffee and checking my Fidelity portfolio. I've been with the company for several years and love the opportunities here, including being a new moderator for this sub. I’m a huge family person (they’ve been my rock), and I cherish my time spent with them. Outside of work, my partner and I are renovating an old house together. Wish us luck!

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play any TTRPGs, but would love to.

I suffer from a bit of learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

**Is Starbucks’ Hot Streak About to Cool Down? Analysts Sound the Alarm**

https://preview.redd.it/2czqve293ble1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9bd30fbd4fbebe50fc3b674246dbf491431c0f3

Starbucks (SBUX) has been on a tear, gaining 15% in the past month as investors rally behind new CEO Brian Niccol’s potential turnaround strategy. But not everyone is convinced the coffee giant’s rally is sustainable. Jefferies analyst Andy Barish is among those urging caution, citing four major risks that could derail Starbucks' stock in the months ahead.

# 1. Same-Store Sales Recovery Faces Uncertainty

One of the biggest concerns is Starbucks’ ability to reignite same-store sales growth. The company reported a 4% decline in global same-store sales last quarter, with North America and U.S. sales also slipping by 4%. China, a crucial international market, saw an even steeper drop of 6%.

Analysts worry that the Street's estimates for second-quarter same-store sales are too optimistic. If Starbucks fails to deliver a meaningful turnaround, investors could quickly turn bearish on the stock.

# 2. Margin Expansion Could Prove Challenging

Expanding profit margins will not be easy. Starbucks has made significant commitments to increasing worker wages and improving store hours—moves that may weigh on profitability. Meanwhile, inflationary pressures and higher input costs continue to be a headwind.

While Niccol’s strategy focuses on streamlining operations and cutting inefficiencies, there’s no guarantee these efforts will translate into higher margins anytime soon.

# 3. A Possible Walk-Back on Cost-Saving Goals

Under previous management, Starbucks announced a bold $1 billion cost-savings initiative. However, analysts worry that the company might step back from this target as it prioritizes investments in marketing, store renovations, and digital expansion.

Already, the company has pulled back on aggressive discounting, a move that may have contributed to the recent drop in sales. If Starbucks cannot balance cost-cutting with growth investments, financial performance could stagnate.

# 4. Earnings Growth May Take Longer Than Expected

Earnings per share (EPS) recovery is another lingering question. While long-term investors are betting on a multi-year turnaround, much of that optimism is already priced into Starbucks’ stock. If the company's earnings recovery lags behind expectations in fiscal 2026 and 2027, shares could see downside pressure.

Adding to the uncertainty, Starbucks has yet to provide concrete sales and earnings guidance for the current fiscal year. Niccol withdrew guidance in October, citing the need for flexibility in investing in store experience, marketing, and staff training.

# The Road Ahead for Starbucks Investors

Despite these risks, some investors remain bullish on Starbucks for the long haul. The company is making strategic moves to streamline operations, including eliminating 1,100 corporate roles and cutting 13 menu items to improve checkout times.

However, short-term headwinds remain a concern. As Barish puts it, “The upside is already greatly embedded in valuation at current levels.” Investors betting on further gains may want to tread carefully as the company navigates these challenges in the months ahead.",1,1740498379.0,Junior_Stocks,0,1.0,False
1ixy174,https://www.reddit.com/r/GLPGrad/comments/1ixy174/my_succesfull_post_mj_life/,My succesfull post MJ life!,"Hi everyone. I was asked to come over and share my post-mounjaro story, so here I am :)

Started MJ almost a year ago, March 24, weighing in at 17 stone, 6ft 2, and a man (still a man). 

From day 1, it worked a dream, barely any side effects of note. I decided due to what I'd heard, i'd cut out the booze (i loved a pint) and get in the gym.

I've got quite an addictive personality, so I became really into eating well, focussing on protein/fibre and cutting out sweet, sugary junk, crisps etc. etc.

I lost consistently, not huge numbers, but a steady 2/3lb a week. Sometimes more sometimes less. By the 12th jab (10mg) I was very much enjoying my new way of eating, no drinking etc, so decided the 12th jab would be my last. I was down to 14st and feeling amazing. I considered titrating down, but just thought, sod it, cold turkey! To be honest, I didnt really feel any different for maybe 4-6 weeks and only gradually did my *bigger* appetite return slowly.

That was back in July last year. As I type this, i'm still around 14 stone. I've continued to eat well, and even enjoy the odd Guinness, but I try not to, as Ive discovered drinking a night before the gym, my heart rate is almost 20bpm higher than when i havent had anything (see, told you i had an addictive personality!)

I prioritise getting 150g+ of protein in a day, and I worked out my maintenance to be 2300 or so calories. I'd still like to lose maybe half a stone, so currently just shaved off 300 cals a day to see if I can shift that in a couple of months.

I don't tend to have breakfast, and just water/coffee till lunch.

Typical lunch, for example today, 3 egg omelette with ham and 2 baby bell (low fat) mixed in with tomato and spinach. a good 40g of protein for 400 or so cals. Then mid afternoon, 250g of Greek yog, loads of frozen fruit, scoop of whey powder and some high protein granola, again about 50g of protein and 400 cals. Tonight, its chicken, veg and potato and then maybe something like a grenade bar and a cuppa before bed.

Its a lifestyle choice for sure, and now i'm used to it, its *quite* easy. I still track my cals and get 10k steps in a day (2 dogs!) plus i'm in the gym 3 times a week.

Freaked out, as I’ve miscarried my first pregnancy, this is my second. I headed to the ER and was told I had “Subchorionic hemorrhage measuring 19 x 9 mm”. 
The ER doctor said they classify this as a “threatened miscarriage”.
Fetal heart beat was present at 159bpm as they conducted the ultrasound, performed a pelvic exam and he said there was very minimal blood and cervix is closed.
Since last night, it has now this morning turned into just very light light brown spotting almost like tiny little coffee grounds only when I wipe. 
I’m just wondering if this has happened to anyone else and if I should be worried of a potential miscarriage. I’m so sad by the word threatened miscarriage but trying to not stress about it.. I just want some reassurance or someone who’s experienced this to give me some more insight.

## Understanding your Needs: key Considerations Before buying

Choosing the right fire pit cover isn't simply about picking the cheapest option. To find the best fire pit cover for your needs, consider these factors:

**1. Size and Shape:**

*   **Measure your fire pit:** Accurately measure the diameter (for round fire pits) or length and width (for square or rectangular fire pits) of your fire pit. The fire pit cover sizes should slightly exceed these measurements to allow for easy covering and removal. A too-tight cover can rip easily.*   **Shape matters:** Fire pit covers come in various shapes: round, square, rectangular, and even custom designs. Choose a cover that matches the shape of your fire pit for a snug and effective fit. For uniquely shaped fire pits, consider a fire pit cover custom.
*   **Depth:** Don't forget to consider the depth or height of your fire pit. Insufficient height will make your fire pit under protected and a waste of money

**2.Material:**

The material of your fire pit cover significantly impacts it's durability and weather resistance. Here's a breakdown of common materials:

*   **Polyester:** A popular choice due to its affordability and water resistance. Look for high-denier polyester (e.g., 600D or 900D) for enhanced tear resistance. Often combined with a PVC backing for extra waterproofing to create all-weather fire pit cover options.
*   **vinyl:** Offers excellent water resistance and durability. However, vinyl can become stiff in cold weather and may not be as breathable as other materials.
*   **Canvas:** A classic choice known for its durability and breathability. Canvas fire pit covers are often treated with a water-repellent coating.
*   **Heavy Duty Materials:** For more robust protection, look for covers made from heavy-duty materials like reinforced PVC or thick, coated polyester.These are ideal for harsh weather conditions.

**3. features:**

*   **Waterproof vs. Water-Resistant:** Understand the difference. Waterproof covers provide complete protection against water penetration, while water-resistant covers offer some protection but may not be suitable for prolonged exposure to heavy rain.
*   **UV Resistance:** Essential for preventing fading and degradation caused by sunlight. Look for a UV resistant fire pit cover, especially if you live in a sunny climate.
*   **Ventilation:** Some covers include vents to promote airflow and prevent moisture buildup, which can lead to rust or mildew.
*   **Straps or Elastic Hem:** These features help secure the cover to your fire pit, preventing it from being blown away by wind. A fire pit cover with straps or an elastic hem is crucial for windy locations. An elastic hem will allow for a more fitted fire pit cover.
*   **Handles:** Make it easier to put on and take off the cover.
*   **Rustproof:** Look for rustproof fire pit cover hardware (like grommets) for long-lasting performance.
*   **Spark Screen Compatibility:** If you use a fire pit spark screen cover, ensure the cover is designed to accommodate it.

**4. Climate:**

The climate you live in will greatly influence the best fire pit cover choice.

*   **Heavy Rain/Snow:** Waterproof covers made from vinyl or coated polyester are ideal.
*   **Sunny Climates:** UV-resistant covers are essential to prevent fading and material degradation.
*   **windy Areas:** Covers with straps or elastic hems are a must to prevent the cover from blowing away.
*   **Cold Climates:** Consider a heavy-duty cover that can withstand freezing temperatures without cracking or becoming brittle.**5. Budget:**

Keep in mind that investing in a higher-quality cover can save you money in the long run by extending the life of your fire pit.

Investigator Reeves brought a hand up towards the large oak door in front of him. He knocked three times on the door of esteemed psychologist Dr. Neumann Kain. The walk towards this door was strangely pleasant to Reeves. He was used to dealing with filth, he couldn’t count the number of times he’s taken the great elevator down just to deal with filth. Black market human traffickers, illegal and inhumane cyberware, gang bosses.. killers and cultists alike. But he could only count on one hand the amount of times he was sent up. Somewhere nicer and cleaner. The clinic he was in was just that, the receptionist was a pleasant young woman with pale blonde hair and a smile you’d see on one of those holo ads. But he couldn’t allow such superficial things to distract him from his job. He was here to investigate Dr. Kain.

Eventually the door opened, breaking his thoughts and causing him to jolt a little. In front of him stood a well-dressed man, wavy auburn hair that reached just above his neckline, he wore clear-framed glasses that barely obstructed his eyes but were a little small on his face, he was a fair skinned man of average height and build, Dr. Neumann Kain. The doctor spoke with a calmness in his voice that spoke of years worth of experience, and yet he looked quite young.

“Yes? May I help you? Do we have an appointment?”

“No, no we don’t doctor.” Reeves reached into his pocket and clicks on a disk the size of a penny, allowing him to display a holo of his credentials.

“Investigator Cameron Reeves with the Par-el Central Bureau of Criminal Analysis. I’m here to talk to you.” He gestured towards the door. “May I?”Without any changes in posture, barely a movement in his eyes, Dr. Kain replied calmly, “Oh, yes, of course. Come in.” Taking a step back, the doctor opened the door and allowed Reeves to walk in.

The office was unsettling, even to a man like Reeves. A creeping unease, as if the air itself was watching. It smelled faintly of leather, sandalwood, and something... metallic. Dark wood floors creaked slightly under Reeves’ weight. A single, large curtained window behind the doctor’s desk allowed enough of the city’s lights to seep in. The walls were lined with books, and a few paces in front of the desk sat two chairs across from each other, with a single glass coffee table between them atop an antique rug.

It was hard to miss the smell of the place, and much harder to miss the two large paintings that adorned the walls one behind each chair.The first depicted an angel wielding a sword, its tip pointed down at the throat of a dragon. Perhaps an old biblical tale. Was Dr. Kain religious? The other showed a kneeling man looking up at the heavens, desperate for salvation. One could only hope there was a god to answer him.

With a cutting calm in his voice Dr. Kain addresses Reeves while taking a seat on the chair in front of the angel. “Please, have a seat” he gestured toward the chair across him.

Reeves nodded in acknowledgement and took a seat. Barely able to adjust himself to the environment, the doctor spoke to him again. 

“I take it you’re here to ask about a patient of mine?” 

“Yes actually.”

“Then I'm sorry to inform you I cannot give the information to you without a warrant. Doctor-patient confidentiality, I'm sure you understand.” the doctor said with a hint of a smile, though there was no real emotion behind it.

Reeves chuckled, there's that line. “Ah, of course, here.” Reeves clicked on his pocket terminal and presented the warrant.“Very well. Oh.. am I reading that correctly? You’re here to ask about Dr. Marcus Falk.”“Yes, I am. You were his psychologist, yes?”

“I’d prefer you call me his counselor. But yes.”

Dr. Kain leaned back in his chair, the soft creak of leather the only sound between them. His eyes studied Reeves with a detached curiosity.

“You knew him? Before he became your patient, I mean.”The doctor sighed lightly, before speaking in that eerily calm tone of his “Yes. I did.”

Reeves nods. “It says here on my file that you had a personal connection to him? Can you corroborate that doctor?”

“Not me, a good friend of mine. His lover.. You could call her that, I suppose.” There was a hint of distaste in the doctor’s tone. A small crack in the carefully constructed armor. It would’ve gone unnoticed under normal circumstances, but not to Reeves.

‘I suppose..’ Reeves mutters to himself. “Alright, so there’s a degree of separation between you and Dr. Falk.”Dr. Kain chuckles. “Yes, investigator. Wouldn’t want to break our code of ethics counselling someone so close to me, right?” It was a hollow noise, one that Reeve couldn’t help but pick up on.He laughs along, “Right, right. Of course.” After a brief pause, “So what was he like?”“He was.. Well-liked. By his peers. Some admired him, many respected him. But like all men, there were a few that resented him.. May he rest.”“If my files are correct, her and Dr. Falk had a falling out, a breakup.”“..I'm impressed. You’ve done your homework, investigator Reeves.” With a long-pause that allowed Reeve’s to feel the air in the office. “But yes. Though, it’s the final one.” 

Reeves cocks an eyebrow. “The final one.. Tsk.. So what was their relationship like?”

At the inquiry something hidden behind the doctor’s eyes seemed to shift ever so slightly. Once calm and collected, he responds in a quiet, thoughtful manner. “It was.. Tragic.”

Reeves let the word settle. ‘Tragic.’ A deliberate choice. A test, maybe. A man like him didn't speak without intention.

Reeves leans forward slightly. “Tragic. How?”Kain exhaled through his nose, a soft, knowing sound. ""How are most tragedies, Investigator?"" He gestured with a single hand, palm up. “Something beautiful twisted into something… barely recognizable. A love built on questionable foundations.”

Reeves glanced down at the notes on his terminal, though it was hardly necessary; he had already memorized it. “Miss Selene Blanche. She was close to you?”A pause, barely a second. But here in the room it all felt so heavy. Dr. Kain lets out a deep breath and sets his glasses aside into his breast pocket “You’ve certainly done your research, investigator.” He said with a slow and deliberate smile. “And it’s Dr. Selene Blanche.  

”The correction did not come as a surprise to Reeves. “Right, Dr. Selene Blanche. You cared about her.” He said as he watched the doctor’s expression closely.

A ghost of something passed over the doctor’s features before it was smoothed away swiftly. “Yes, I did. I do. Sorry.” Though the last word of the response was barely audible to Reeves.Reeves pretended not to hear, but he had a feeling that apology wasn’t meant for him. “Hm? I couldn’t quite catch that.”

“Nothing, it’s nothing.” 

Reeves lets the silence stretch, watching Kain’s stillness. He didn’t glance away nor fidget, he simply sat. Waiting.

Then, after another moment. Reeves finally spoke. “Well, since you cared for Dr. Blanche so much, you must’ve cared for Dr. Falk too, right?”Without missing a beat, the response came swiftly. “Care is.. Such a broad word, don’t you think?”

“Of course, but indulge me. Did you or did you not care for him?”“I care for all of my patients, as any good doctor should. But I did not care for him personally, I cared for what he was capable of, and what he was doing. I was his psychologist. Not his friend.”Reeves pursed his lips. Was. The past tense again, as though Dr. Falk had already ceased to exist. Reeves leaned forward slightly, voice calm but pressing. “You keep speaking about Dr. Falk in the past tense. That might just be a coincidence, maybe a habit of yours. But given the current circumstances…”The doctor didn’t so much as shift in his chair. “Circumstances?”

“He’s missing,” Reeves said plainly “And yet you speak of him as though he were already gone. ‘May he rest’ as if you’d already mourned him. At least that’s what I’m hearing.”

The doctor’s lips curled slightly, a light look of amusement plastered onto his face. “What you’re hearing is your own assumption investigator. Besides, it’s not hard to assume he’s already gone.” The doctor smiled, for the first time. “In a city like Par-el, at these middle levels? The missing don’t have a habit of turning up, do they?”Touche. Reeves couldn’t help but agree, he’d been with the bureau long enough to know not a word of that was a lie. He let out a soft chuckle before replying. “That’s fair.” 

Reeves couldn’t help the pit forming in his stomach as the doctor slowly put his glasses back on. But Reeves presses forward, unwilling to back down now. “Dr. Falk went missing 6 days ago.”“I am aware.” He shouldn’t be. This was not public information. This statement alone was enough to put him under scrutiny, it was grounds for arrest. But instead, Reeves remained cautious. It had thrown him off wildly, the doctor should know it wasn’t public? Did he? Or did he not? Was this a slip of the mind or another deliberate message? It all began to ring in the investigator’s head

And then the doctor asked a question–cutting through the noise. “Tell me investigator, do you dream?” It had caught Reeves off-guard.

“Wha-”

“It’s just an inquiry. Those in your line of work… they see so much. Carry so much. It wears on them. I often wonder to myself.. What nightmares do men like you have?”

Reeves remained quiet–he did not wish to answer. But it was not like the doctor would’ve allowed him to respond.

“Do you still believe in justice? I’m sure a man like you would be a bit jaded from your time in this place that we begrudgingly call home.” Then the doctor stands up and walks over to a cabinet on the far end of the room momentarily halting their conversation before returning with two glasses of water.

Dr. Kain set the glasses on the table and gestured for the investigator to take one before continuing. Taking before saying “Actually, it’s not about what dreams you have that I wonder about,” his voice now taking an almost wistful tone “I wonder if you have dreams like I do?”Reeves with the glass of water in hand did not take a sip, instead he chose to swirl it and indulge the doctor in his questioning. “Of justice?” he asked, leaning back.

The doctor shook his head and responded quietly, “No. Of monsters.” The alarm bells were ringing in Reeves' head. Everything in his body screamed for him to arrest this man. But he couldn’t. Not yet. He needed something more. Just a little more. One more slip, one more tell.

“What about them, doctor?”

“I often dream the same dream–In the quiet of the night, a young girl sits by the water. She picks lilies from the pond, one by one, humming to herself. She likes the white ones best, I think.”

His voice is even, careful. But there’s something else beneath it. Something that makes Reeves straighten just slightly.

“Then, the monster comes.”

The words hang in the air.

“It doesn’t lunge, doesn’t growl. It kneels. Smiles. Speaks softly. The kind of softness that makes your skin crawl.”

Kain’s fingers twitched.

“It takes a flower from her hands. And the whole world is still.” –he sighs.

“And then, it leaves. And I'm jolted awake.” The doctor let out an exhale with a slight tremor to it “It disgusts me, that dream. It makes me wish for an idyllic world, one I know is too far from the truth.”

The doctor paused, allowing his words to hang in the air for a moment before continuing. “But, thankfully.. Unlike in that dream. I can move, I can act.”

Reeves clenched his jaw. This man spoke in riddles–he’s dealt with the type before but it doesn’t make the experience any less irritating. He didn’t know what the hell Dr. Kain was talking about. But deep down, he understood. He knows. This is the one, this is the man who got rid of Dr. Marcus Falk.

1ixxu26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1ixxu26/smoking_withdrawal_because_of_alcoholparty/,Smoking withdrawal because of alcohol/party incoming?,"**Hello everyone,**

I smoked my last cigarette 11 days ago. I had been smoking for 10 years, even though I work out regularly and consider myself very fit. But despite that, I was still trapped in this slow suicide of smoking.

# Here’s the problem:

I'm going on a skiing trip this Saturday. For the past 10 years, smoking has always been part of my ski vacations because of my addiction and the large amounts of beer and Jägermeister we drink (I won’t change that part 😄).

This year will be no different in terms of partying. I’m realistic—I know the odds of relapsing are high because after a few drinks, I might let my guard down. If I start smoking again after a few beers, I know how it will go: one cigarette after my morning coffee, then after a nice lunch, then more with beer, partying, and so on.

Right now, I can resist smoking, but it takes a lot of effort and willpower.  
At first, I was highly motivated, and it was crystal clear that quitting was the right decision. But now, I feel like I'm fighting a mental battle against myself.

My questions :

1. Did I choose the wrong time to quit, considering the ultimate temptation of the ski vacation? Maybe 20–30 days of being smoke-free before the trip would have made me stronger?
2. Should I just allow myself to smoke during this vacation one last time, enjoying it fully, and then make the ultimate cut afterward?
3. Should I go all in—no excuses, no overthinking—just drink and enjoy the trip WITHOUT smoking? Be mentally and physically strong as steel?
4. Do I need a complete mindset shift and stop associating drinking with smoking altogether?

I would be very grateful if someone could reply and read through my problem. 

Thanks & I wish everyone a great & powerful day

We are on day 2, still block 1 (totally naked)
His attitude towards the potty has deteriorated rapidly. 
Day 1 we were about 50/50 with accidents vs getting some or all in the potty and he seemed fairly enthusiastic about it all.

Today is a different story- he seems to be withholding pee or refusing to release I’m not sure- he will let out a few squirts standing (usually in a corner or against our coffee table) and when redirected and placed or led to his potty refuses to go. I have tried giving him privacy(he tends to bolt off the potty when I do this), warm water, blowing bubbles, horse whinny, water sounds, we have a falling beads toy that is calming to play with but nothing.

He did not poop Day1. Then today he started (off potty) and when led to potty he went absolutely nuts- screaming/crying etc. needless to say he did not finish. 
Again, he started to poop off potty, I redirected to the potty and once again he went insane! I essentially let him poop on the floor next to his potty and then we took some time hygienically (lol) placing it into his potty and then into the big potty. 

I’m kind of at a loss on what to do. I am feeling super discouraged at the moment. Maybe he wasn’t ready? I revisited all the info last night and was focused on making it a low stress affair but somehow it’s spiraling.

1ixxp11,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1ixxp11/should_you_explore_the_lertin_em615_espresso/,Should you explore the LERTIN EM615 espresso machine? A detailed review awaits!,"The LERTIN EM615 espresso machine has been a part of my morning routine for weeks now, and as someone who thrives on caffeine to kickstart the day, I’ve put this machine through its paces. Designed for home use but with professional-grade features, this compact espresso machine boasts a sleek design and offers a variety of functionalities that make brewing both simple and satisfying. However, it's not without its quirks, so let's dive into the details.

**Design & Build Quality**

At first glance, the LERTIN EM615 catches the eye with its stainless steel body and compact structure. Its dimensions make it ideal for smaller kitchens, fitting snugly on my countertop without hogging too much space. The LED touch screen gives it a modern touch and is fairly intuitive to navigate. While the machine feels sturdy overall, some of the plastic components, like the tamper, feel a bit on the lighter side. I’d recommend upgrading the tamper if you’re aiming for a more premium feel.

**Features**

What sets the LERTIN EM615 apart is its comprehensive set of features. The 20-bar professional Italian pump ensures high-pressure extraction, which is crucial for a rich and aromatic espresso. Additionally, the machine includes a built-in milk frother, making it a breeze to prepare lattes, cappuccinos, and even macchiatos. The NTC temperature sensor is a neat touch too, automatically adjusting water temperature to balance acidity and enhance flavor. The energy-saving auto shut-off function, which activates after 20 minutes of inactivity, is a nice bonus for those of us who might forget to turn off appliances.

[Click here to see the price](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0djt5pzt4/).

**Brewing Performance**

One thing I noticed immediately was how quickly the machine heats up. Within minutes, I was pulling my first shot of espresso. The 20-bar pressure system delivers a robust and creamy espresso shot, with a layer of crema that rivals what you’d get from a café. However, it’s worth noting that the instructions can be a bit unclear, especially for beginners. After a bit of trial and error (and a few overly watery shots), I was able to figure out the optimal grind size and tamping pressure for the best results.

**Milk Frothing & Steaming Capability**

The milk frother is an absolute game-changer for me. With its 360° adjustable nozzle, I’ve been able to create dense, velvety froth for cappuccinos and silky milk for lattes. My spouse, who adores macchiatos, was particularly impressed. The frother does emit a bit of water initially, so make sure to purge it for a few seconds before frothing. Cleaning the nozzle is straightforward, thanks to its detachable design.

**Coffee Quality**

Every espresso shot I’ve brewed has been aromatic and flavorful, with a balanced taste profile that leans neither too acidic nor too bitter. The machine’s precision temperature control plays a significant role in this. It’s also worth mentioning that the warming plate on top of the machine is a thoughtful addition. By pre-heating my cup, I noticed a slight but noticeable improvement in the overall coffee experience.

**Water Tank & Capacity**

The 61-ounce water tank is a lifesaver if you’re someone who brews multiple cups a day. I’ve gone days without needing to refill it, and the clear water level indicator with a red buoy is a helpful touch. The removable tank makes cleaning and refilling effortless, which is a big plus for those busy mornings when time is limited.

**Maintenance & Cleaning**

Keeping the LERTIN EM615 clean has been relatively easy. The drip tray slides out smoothly for emptying, and the removable components like the water tank and milk frother nozzle are easy to wash. However, the drip tray does fill up quickly due to the automatic purging system, so you’ll need to keep an eye on it. A quick rinse and wipe after each use have kept the machine looking as good as new.

**Energy Efficiency & Noise Levels**

The machine operates quietly compared to other espresso makers I’ve used in the past. The auto shut-off feature is a fantastic energy-saving addition, especially for someone like me who’s often in a rush and forgets to power off appliances.

**Warranty & Support**

Although I haven’t had any issues requiring customer service, it’s comforting to know that LERTIN is responsive based on other user reviews. The warranty offers some peace of mind, and the manual provides troubleshooting tips for common issues.

**Advantages**

* Compact design fits small spaces effortlessly.
* 20-bar pressure system ensures rich, café-quality espresso.
* Built-in milk frother delivers creamy, dense froth.
* Large 61-ounce removable water tank reduces frequent refills.
* Energy-saving auto shut-off feature.

**Areas for Improvement**

* Instructions could be clearer, especially for beginners.
* Plastic tamper feels flimsy; an upgrade is recommended.
* Drip tray fills quickly and requires frequent emptying.
* Initial milk frother purge emits water, which needs managing.

**Competitive Options**

In comparison to other semi-automatic espresso machines like the Breville Bambino Plus, the LERTIN EM615 holds its ground well in terms of price and features. While the Breville offers slightly more refined steaming capabilities, the LERTIN excels in ease of use and affordability. On the other hand, machines like the De’Longhi Dedica have a smaller footprint but lack the built-in milk frother, which makes the LERTIN a more all-in-one solution for home baristas.

**Cost Efficiency**

Given its price point, the LERTIN EM615 offers excellent value for money. It strikes a fine balance between high-end features and affordability, making it ideal for coffee enthusiasts looking to elevate their home brewing without breaking the bank. For its performance, versatility, and ease of use, this espresso machine is a worthwhile investment.

1ixxowf,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ixxowf/i_f26_dont_think_my_husband_m26_is_the_ideal_man/,"I [F26] don’t think my husband [M26] is the ideal man for me, how do i deal with it?","Me and my husband were dating for around 6 years when he finally proposed last summer. We have never lived together before marriage due to cultural backgrounds and once we got engaged we rented an apartment together. Before that he lived with roommates and i lived with my parents but we occasionally had sleepovers or we were hanging out during the weekends. 

Once we moved in, i realised that i don’t like a lot of things that he’s doing. I still love him deeply so we tried to accommodate each other. I made some sacrifices and he made some too. We didn’t have any fights whatsoever. 

December past year we moved in to an apartment that i inherited from my family. We put lots of money towards renovations, and furniture shopping and working so we had plenty of fun. Now, once we settled down, i noticed changes in his behaviour, maybe i changed too, i can’t tell. 

He usually works from home, and i do too. I always thought that it would be fun to have him around at home but now i can’t stand that. Despite me working from home, i still try to go out everyday. Its usually with my sister, my mother, i would go out for a coffee, i would go shopping, meet friends, have activities, go to the flea markets every morning, wake up earlier. I try to pass through my moms house every two or three days. I call my friends, i go to the mall etc. The thing is, that my husband doesn’t have any of these activities.

He doesn’t have friends, he doesn’t like hanging out, he doesn’t like music, he barely leaves home. The only activity he has is going to the gym which is for an hour out. He sleeps till 1pm and afterwards he’s on his computer 24/7. He barely leaves the couch, he shrunk it actually. He watches tiktoks, instagram, or memes. The only time he works is during the night when i sleep and i go to bed alone. During the day he spends time online. 

Now i wish i could come home into an empty apartment, i wish i could clean in peace, cook in peace or have someone over. I cant call anyone over because he gets mad that they were disturbing him. My mom and sister used to come over often for a coffee or tea but eventually stopped because they didn’t feel welcome. My husband was always in a bad mood, constantly checking what we do, constantly checking what they eat, we cant have conversations in private, he wants to hear everything wants to know everything… 

I cant have friends over in the morning because he sleeps. My father stopped by the other day it was already 2pm and he was still in bed. My grandparents have stopped by couple of times before in the morning while i was at the flea market and he didn’t even feel the doorbell which led the people go away. 

We don’t have health insurance, we live here in Europe and usually the whole family is covered by the man’s / father’s insurance plan. He doesn’t work anywhere in the country, its mostly online like a digital nomad, but he stays at home. He doesn’t have any plans for the future, plans for retirement or any money set aside. He doesn’t drive, and whenever we go its me driving him around.

He says he doesn’t wanna work 9-5 but sometimes i wish he was. I cant stand having him at home 24/7. Everything he does annoys me. I still love him, but we started fighting more often and often. This makes me question if thats the man i wanna stay with or have children. Whenever we disagree or have arguments its like fighting with a child. He’s so stubborn, he doesn’t admit even when he’s wrong. He thinks he’s the best, that he’s always in the right, its really pointless having a conversation. He always turns it around and makes you feel guilty. ",2,1740497482.0,relationship_advice,14,0.67,False

1ixxnzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmint/comments/1ixxnzv/graphics_lag_with_linux_mint_while_playing/,Graphics lag with Linux Mint while playing Neverwinter Online through Steam,"Greetings! 

I recently switched to Linux Mint 22.1. I have been using Linux for a while, PopOs to be specific, and have been playing games mostly using Steam. After about 45 minutes of game play, the game, in this case Neverwinter, begins to have a ""stuttering"" sort of lag. My internet speed is good so I don't think is it. Plus, nothing else is lagging on me at any time. I have attached my specs and internet speed.

  
I have lowered my graphics on Neverwinter and the lag still occurs. I thought it might have been the on demand patching. I have disabled it and force verified. The lag still occurs. I am not sure exactly what the issue is but any suggestions would be great.

## Who Needs a Pocket Projector? Identifying the Target Audience

Before we delve into the specific products and features, let's understand who benefits most from owning a pocket projector. As identified in the audience analysis, several key segments⁣ are actively searching​ for ‍these devices,‌ each with unique needs and expectations:

Thay often search for ""pico projector presentations"" and need a truly ""travel projector,”⁤ something ‌incredibly compact and lightweight. The ideal portable projector‍ for⁣ business meetings needs to be reliable, easy to set up, and capable of delivering clear, professional-quality visuals.

*  ⁣ **Mobile ⁣Professionals:** Freelancers, consultants, and‌ remote workers ‌also crave adaptability. Imagine conducting impromptu meetings at a coffee shop, co-working ⁣space, or even a client's office, all powered​ by a small, easily ⁣transportable projector.This ⁤segment is actively seeking a ""pico projector for remote work"" or a “portable projector for ‍consultants.” Their emphasis lies⁤ on connectivity and versatility, enabling seamless presentations and collaborations from any location.

## Defining the Pico Projector: What to Expect in 2025

Before we get into the specifics, let's define the⁤ pico projector and what we expect to see in advancements for 2025. A *pico projector* ⁤is ⁢essentially a ​miniature projector designed for maximum ‌portability. They are typically ⁣smaller than⁢ a smartphone and often weigh just a⁣ few ounces. Don’t underestimate them, though.

As we​ move towards 2025, we anticipate several key advancements in this category:

*   **Increased ‍Brightness:** One of the biggest challenges for pico projectors has always been brightness.Expect to see ‌significant improvements in lumen output, ‍making these devices more usable in⁣ brighter environments.

##‌ Key Considerations ⁢When Buying a Pico Projector

Choosing⁤ the right pico projector depends on your specific needs and priorities. ‌Here are some key factors to consider:

*   **Brightness (Lumens):** This is arguably the most critically important factor.‌ The higher the lumen output,‍ the brighter the image and the‌ better the projector‍ will perform‍ in ⁣ambient light. ⁢For ‍use in bright environments, aim​ for at least ⁣300-500 lumens.
*   **Resolution:** This determines the ⁣sharpness ‌and‌ clarity of the‍ image. Native 1080p ​is ideal for⁢ watching movies ⁣and TV shows, while 720p is ‍sufficient for presentations and casual⁤ viewing.
*   **Connectivity:** Consider the types of devices‍ you'll be connecting to the projector.Ensure it has the ⁤necessary ports (HDMI,⁣ USB) and wireless connectivity (wi-Fi, Bluetooth). The best models allow connectivity for ⁢*""pico projector for‍ laptop""* and mobile.*   **Battery Life:** If you⁣ plan to use ⁢the⁣ projector on the go,⁤ battery⁢ life is crucial. Look for models that offer at least 2-3 hours of playback time.
*   **Portability:** A *small projector* must ⁣be easily transported. Check the projector's dimensions and⁢ weight ‌to ensure it's truly ‌portable.
*   **Price:** ‌A ‍*pico projector price*​ can⁤ vary widely depending on the features and performance. Set a budget⁢ and compare different models within that range.*   **Operating System:** A *pico projector* with Android built-in can be an advantage for streaming, but make sure to consider ease of set⁣ up.

## ⁢Potential ⁢Drawbacks: managing expectations

While pico projectors offer numerous benefits, it’s essential to be‍ aware of their limitations:

*   ‌**Lower brightness:** Compared to ⁤traditional projectors, pico projectors typically have lower brightness levels, which can affect‌ image quality in brighter environments.
*  ⁤ **Limited resolution:** While some models offer 1080p resolution, many still have lower resolutions, which may ‌not⁤ be⁢ ideal for demanding viewing‌ scenarios.

## Tips for Optimizing Your Pico Projector Experience

Once you've purchased a *pico projector*, here are ​some tips for maximizing your viewing experience:

*  ​ **Choose a Dark Environment:** Pico ⁤projectors perform best in dark environments. ⁣Minimize ambient ‍light to enhance image quality.
*   **Use a Projector Screen:** Projecting onto a dedicated projector ‌screen will result in a sharper and ⁢more ⁣vibrant image compared⁣ to projecting onto a wall.
*  ⁤ **Adjust ‌the Focus and keystone Correction:** Ensure the‌ image is properly focused and that the keystone correction is adjusted to eliminate any distortion.
*   **Connect to external Speakers:** While some pico projectors have built-in speakers, connecting to external speakers will ⁤substantially improve the audio ​quality.This can be done with any *pico⁢ projector bluetooth*‌ enabled.
*   **Keep the Projector Clean:** ​regularly clean the projector lens with a soft cloth to remove dust and debris.

1ixxnck,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1ixxnck/why_should_you_check_out_the_icepure_under_sink/,Why should you check out the ICEPURE under sink water filter review?,"Testing out the ICEPURE WFS5300A under sink water filter system felt like a small, satisfying science experiment right in my kitchen. As someone who’s borderline obsessed with clean water (blame years of questionable city water experiences), I wanted to see if this filter could walk the talk. Spoiler: it mostly does—but let’s unpack the details.

**Ease of Installation & Use**

I’m not exactly a DIY wizard, but installing this filter was easy enough that I felt like one. The box included everything I needed: a filter head, inlet and outlet hoses, and even an adapter for less common setups. The instructions were straightforward, and the whole installation took me under 15 minutes. The hardest part? Clearing out the clutter under my sink. I particularly loved the “plug-and-play” design. No need to drill new holes or call in reinforcements.

Want to know if [ICEPURE WFS5300A](https://usedwater.com/price/b08ndww4dh/) is worth your money? Check it out here.

**Filtration Technology & Effectiveness**

This system boasts NSF/ANSI 42 and NSF/ANSI 372 certifications, which is a fancy way of saying it removes chlorine, heavy metals, and other impurities while keeping beneficial minerals intact. The water tasted noticeably cleaner—no chlorine aftertaste, no funky odors. My pets even seemed happier drinking from their bowls (yes, I tested this). The 0.5-micron carbon block filter also gave me peace of mind about sediment and other contaminants. It’s like a little lab working under your sink.

**Flow Rate & Performance**

The flow rate is where this system really shines. Unlike the trickling streams I’ve suffered with other filters, this one delivers a robust 2.5 gallons per minute. Filling a pot for pasta or a glass of water doesn’t feel like an eternity. Think of it as a firehose compared to a garden hose—okay, maybe not that dramatic, but you get the idea.

**Features**

This filter system is all about convenience. It connects directly to your existing faucet, sparing you from installing an extra one. Plus, the BPA-free, food-grade materials and advanced coconut shell carbon provide a sense of security. I also appreciated the included stickers for tracking installation and replacement dates. It’s a small touch, but it’s one less thing to forget.

**Filter Lifespan & Replacement**

Here’s where it gets impressive: the filter is rated for 22,000 gallons or about three years. That’s three times longer than most filters I’ve tried. No more crawling under the sink every six months! Replacements are reasonably priced, so it’s a win for both my budget and my sanity.

**Capacity & Suitability**

This system is designed for cold water lines and fits 1/2"" or 3/8"" connections. I installed mine in the kitchen, but it’s versatile enough for bathrooms, RVs, or even bar setups. It handles daily needs like drinking, cooking, and making coffee without breaking a sweat.

**Certifications**

Having NSF/ANSI 42 and 372 certifications is a reassuring stamp of approval. It means the filter has been independently tested to meet high standards for chlorine reduction and lead-free materials. It’s like having a blue checkmark for water filters.

**Warranty**

The warranty isn’t the most extensive, but it covers manufacturing defects, which is standard for these types of products. I didn’t encounter any issues, so I can’t comment on how their customer service handles claims.

**Good Points**

* Exceptional filtration that removes chlorine, heavy metals, and odors.
* Extended filter lifespan of up to three years.
* Robust flow rate of 2.5 gallons per minute.
* Straightforward installation process with all necessary parts included.

**Shortcomings**

* Only compatible with cold water lines.
* The filter housing is bulky, so it takes up a decent amount of under-sink space.
* Not suitable for faucets without 1/2"" or 3/8"" connections unless you buy extra adapters.

**Direct Competitors**

Compared to the Aquasana and Woder systems, the ICEPURE filter offers a much longer lifespan and better flow rate. Aquasana filters need replacing every 500 gallons, which feels like a chore in comparison. Woder filters last for 8,500 gallons but lack the same high flow rate. If you’re about convenience and performance, ICEPURE pulls ahead.

**Smart Spending**

While the upfront cost is slightly higher than some other systems, the extended filter lifespan makes it a cost-effective choice in the long run. You’ll save on replacement filters and enjoy superior performance, making it worth the investment.

Basically— I keep a bag of veggie scraps in my freezer— carrot peels, onion bits, the ends of peppers, celery bits, mushroom stems, you get it. 
I simmered the scraps in water for a few hours and strained out all of the solids. It’s pretty clear, but dark (ie the veg didn’t really break down)

What do folks think about using this as a fasting beverage? I think it’d make electrolytes a little more palatable, tbh because it’d be a little savoury already.
I can’t imagine it has many (any?) calories at all, but hopefully has some minerals.

I’m mostly fasting for autophagy benefits and reducing inflammation.

I’m “dirty fasting” in that I’m having black coffee and tea, seltzer water, but am not including artificially sweetened drinks or anything that’s overly processed. ",1,1740497342.0,fasting,2,1.0,False

Some things that stood out to me after calling the Portland metro area home for 15 years. I am helping my Dad recover from surgery

1) The thrift stores here are amazing and have not yet been monopolized by resellers.  I found 2 cashmere sweaters in the rack at Savers which would be like winning the lottery at home.  I found so many quality jeans I am going to have to ship them home. Granted the winter clothes are what I am finding but in Portland people buy high quality items and reselling them online to the point where you cannot find quality items

2) Lack of mens fashion and prevalence of hats. One thing that I immediately noticed is there is a common look of shorts, ball cap and t-shirt for most men. I moved in 2010 and don’t recall hats being such a part of men’s everyday look.  It feels very strange to see them everywhere. 

3) Why do people not walk? Maybe a better question is, where are people exercising? I walk/run my neighborhood twice a day and will typically pass or see 10-15 people also walking. I have run my Dad’s Gilbert neighborhood at dawn and dusk every single day and have yet to see another person walking the neighborhood. Do people just not walk here or are you exercising other places?  Granted, when I lived here I never walked either.

4) Lack of non-starbucks coffee, coffee roasters. The coffee situation here is pretty dire, maybe it’s the water but I just cannot get a decent cup.  Where do coffee snobs go?

1ixxjzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBagCheck/comments/1ixxjzb/discover_the_versatility_of_the_wrangler/,Discover the versatility of the Wrangler WR-92020-3C-530 carry-on luggage review,"Traveling frequently has turned me into a bit of a luggage enthusiast, and testing the Wrangler WR-92020-3C-530 carry-on luggage has been an interesting experience. This lilac-colored carry-on is packed with features that cater to both convenience and style, but it's not without its quirks. I've put it through the wringer on multiple trips, and here's my take.

**Features**

What stood out to me immediately was the built-in 3-in-1 cup holder, phone holder, and USB port. These features are cleverly integrated and genuinely useful. During a layover, I had my phone securely held in place while sipping coffee from the cup holder, all while topping up my device’s battery. It's rare to find such smart functionality in carry-ons, and I’ve found myself wondering how I managed without it before.

The 360-degree spinner wheels are another highlight. Gliding through crowded airports felt effortless, and I didn’t have to wrestle with the suitcase when navigating tight spaces. The wheels are incredibly smooth, which made a big difference when I had to rush to catch a connection.

[Check Wrangler WR-92020-3C-530 price on Amazon.](https://bagsby.com/check/b0cbnmtgbk/)

**Capacity & Organization**

Despite its compact 20-inch size, the storage capacity surprised me. I managed to pack for a five-day trip, including a couple of pairs of shoes, toiletries, and even some extras. The interior organization is well thought out, with zippered compartments that allowed me to separate clean clothes from used ones. Additionally, the expandable option came in handy when I purchased a few souvenirs.

The bottom compartment, equipped with a Velcro holder for a charging pack, showcased attention to detail. On one trip, this compartment kept my portable charger neatly tucked away while still accessible when I needed it.

**Weight & Portability**

Clocking in at about 7 pounds, the suitcase is lightweight yet sturdy. Carrying it up and down escalators in the city wasn’t a hassle. Its portability, combined with the smooth wheels, made it a reliable companion for urban travel and airport dashing. I even sat on it briefly in a long security line, and it held my weight without any issues.

**Design & Materials**

The lilac color adds a touch of personality, ensuring it stands out on luggage carousels. The hardside shell feels durable, and while it survived minor bumps during transit, I did notice a small scratch after my third trip. The telescopic handle, while functional, felt slightly wobbly when fully extended. It didn’t break or malfunction, but it’s something to keep an eye on.

**Handles & Comfort**

Both the top and side carry handles are well-padded, making it easy to lift the luggage into overhead compartments or car trunks. I appreciated the ergonomic design, especially when I had to carry it for longer distances. However, I did notice that the side handle seemed slightly less robust compared to the top one.

**Weather Resistance**

This carry-on held up well during rainy weather. The hardside shell repelled water effectively, ensuring my belongings stayed dry. However, it doesn’t come with a waterproof zipper, so I’d avoid exposing it to prolonged heavy rain.

**Security & Locking System**

One of the downsides is the lack of a built-in TSA-approved lock. While you can purchase a separate lock, it would have been more convenient to have this feature integrated. It’s not a deal-breaker, but it’s something to consider if security is a top priority.

**Warranty**

I couldn’t find much about the warranty, which is a slight concern if you’re planning to invest in this carry-on for the long term. Having clear warranty terms would have been reassuring, especially for frequent travelers.

**Highlights**

* Smooth 360-degree spinner wheels for effortless maneuverability
* Stylish lilac design with a durable hardside shell
* Built-in 3-in-1 cup holder, phone holder, and USB port for added functionality
* Lightweight and easy to carry

**Caveats**

* Lacks an integrated TSA-approved lock
* Telescopic handle feels slightly wobbly
* Minor scratches can appear after a few uses

**Market Rivals**

Comparing this carry-on to others in its category, the Samsonite Winfield 2 comes to mind. While the Samsonite offers a more premium feel and includes a TSA-approved lock, it doesn’t have the quirky features like the cup and phone holder that the Wrangler carry-on boasts. On the other hand, the American Tourister Moonlight is another competitor with its vibrant designs and similar durability, though it doesn’t include a USB port.

Where the Wrangler excels is in its unique features. The 3-in-1 functionality is a game-changer for anyone who values convenience during travel. However, its lack of an integrated lock and slightly less polished build quality might push some towards its competitors.

**Value for Money**

In terms of affordability, this carry-on offers decent value for its features. The smart additions like the USB port and cup holder justify the price point, making it a worthy option for travelers who prioritize functionality and style over premium materials. It’s not the cheapest luggage out there, but it’s far from the most expensive, striking a balance between quality and cost.

1ixxd37,https://v.redd.it/xic2nxw3yale1,AI-Powered Surveillance Capitalism in the Workplace 🖤,"Introduction

Advances in artificial intelligence have enabled a new wave of workplace surveillance capitalism, where employers collect and analyze vast amounts of employee data to monitor and control workers. From warehouse floors to home offices, AI-driven systems track workers’ activities – often in minute detail – in the name of efficiency and productivity. Tools like facial recognition scanners, keystroke loggers, and algorithmic “bosses” are becoming increasingly common. Analysts warn that “the future of work is a future of increasing surveillance and decreasing worker control.” ￼ Indeed, surveys show an explosion in employee monitoring: one 2023 poll of 1,000 companies with remote or hybrid staff found 96% now use some form of monitoring software, up from just 10% before the pandemic ￼. Three in four of those companies had fired workers based on monitoring data, and over two-thirds reported employees quit due to the surveillance ￼. This report examines how AI is being used to watch over workers – from factories and logistics to offices – and the implications for privacy, labor rights, and the future of work.

AI-Driven Surveillance Methods and Real-World Examples

Facial Recognition and Biometric Monitoring

Employers are increasingly leveraging biometric technologies like facial recognition and even more invasive tools to keep tabs on workers. In some offices and factories, face-scanning systems are used for time clocks or access control, matching a worker’s face to a database to log attendance. For example, numerous companies in Illinois were sued under the state’s Biometric Information Privacy Act for requiring employees to scan fingerprints on time clocks without proper consent ￼. In China, some firms have piloted emotion recognition and even brainwave monitoring on the job. A factory in Hangzhou reportedly outfitted workers with EEG-based “brain-reading” helmets that use AI to detect emotional states like anxiety or anger ￼. One state-owned company claimed this “emotional surveillance” program boosted its profits by about 2 billion yuan (~$315 million) since 2014 ￼. (Experts doubt such dramatic results, noting that inferring emotions from brain signals or facial expressions is highly questionable science ￼.) Nonetheless, the dystopian concept – literally reading workers’ minds or moods to optimize productivity – is no longer science fiction. Even in the West, startups market “emotion AI” that scans facial micro-expressions or voice tones to gauge if an employee is happy, confused, or stressed ￼ ￼. The goal, ostensibly, is to improve performance or workplace well-being, but it crosses a clear privacy line. As one report noted, such tools allow bosses to “guess our private emotions – and [use] them against us.” ￼

Case in point: In customer service call centers, some companies use AI to monitor voice biometrics and tone in real time. Insurer MetLife, for instance, deployed an AI coach called Cogito that listens to phone calls and alerts agents and supervisors about their mood and energy. A “cheery little coffee cup” icon pops up when an agent’s voice sounds tired or disengaged, nudging them to perk up ￼ ￼. A heart icon appears if the customer is getting emotional, prompting extra empathy. While presented as a tool to help workers adjust their behavior, it is effectively AI surveillance of workers’ emotional state – raising questions about how that data might later be used in performance evaluations or disciplinary decisions.

Keystroke Tracking and Digital Activity Monitoring

In offices and remote work settings, employers are turning to “bossware” – software that monitors every keystroke, mouse movement, email, or website click. These programs often run silently on employees’ computers, logging productivity metrics and even taking screenshots or webcam photos. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) notes that some employers now record workers’ conversations, track their movements via GPS or RFID badges, and use keyloggers and screenshot tools on work computers ￼. The COVID-19 shift to remote work greatly accelerated this trend. Companies still skeptical that people are productive at home deployed an arsenal of monitoring apps. By late 2020, workplace analysts described it as a “new normal” of surveillance. Microsoft even introduced a “Productivity Score” feature in its Office 365 software that gave managers a 0–800 score based on how often each employee used email, chat, and even turned on their webcam during meetings ￼ ￼. Privacy advocates were alarmed, calling it a “full-fledged workplace surveillance tool” that could be illegal in privacy-conscious jurisdictions ￼. Faced with backlash, Microsoft had to remove individual employee identifiers from the Productivity Score, apologizing for what critics deemed “workplace surveillance” ￼ ￼.

Other firms use dedicated tracking software like Hubstaff, Teramind, or ActivTrak to log computer activity. Some programs count keystrokes and clicks, flagging if a worker seems “idle” for more than a few minutes. In extreme cases, employers require live video feeds of remote staff – one survey found 37% of remote companies even mandate employees keep their webcam on all day so managers can visually confirm they’re at their desks ￼. Such constant digital monitoring can create an atmosphere of fear and distrust. There have been tangible punishments as well. In one notable case, a Canadian accountant was fired after her employer installed a time-tracking app (TimeCamp) on her laptop. The software discovered 50 hours of “time theft” – periods she billed as work but had no keyboard or mouse activity – over a few weeks. A civil tribunal not only upheld the firing but even ordered the employee to repay $2,600 in wages for those unproductive hours ￼ ￼. This case starkly illustrates how digital surveillance data is being used punitively, to enforce productivity with financial consequences for workers.

Algorithmic Management in Warehousing and Gig Work

In manufacturing, warehousing, and gig economy jobs, AI is increasingly the boss. So-called “algorithmic management” systems assign tasks, set performance targets, and even discipline or fire workers with minimal human oversight. Nowhere is this more infamous than at Amazon. Amazon’s massive fulfillment centers run on a relentless drive for efficiency, with automation and surveillance intertwined in a regime of “digital Taylorism” ￼. Each warehouse worker carries a handheld scanner that tracks every item picked or stowed – and by extension, tracks the worker’s pace. The company’s systems log “time off task” (TOT) whenever there’s a lull in scans, down to the minute. Internal documents revealed that Amazon can and does automatically generate warnings and even termination papers if an employee’s TOT exceeds set thresholds ￼ ￼. For example, at one Amazon facility, accumulating just 30 minutes of TOT in a day could trigger a written warning; 120 minutes in a single day was grounds for automatic firing ￼. Workers have been written up for things as routine as spending a few extra minutes in the bathroom or “talking to another associate.” One report showed a worker was questioned for an 11-minute interval where he “does not remember” what he was doing ￼. Managers were even instructed to identify the “top offender” each shift – the employee with the most TOT – and “coach” them on every unproductive minute ￼ ￼. This hyper-monitoring effectively forces workers to account for every bathroom trip and quick chat, creating immense pressure to stay constantly in motion.

Amazon’s algorithmic management isn’t limited to the warehouse floor. The company also uses AI-enabled surveillance for its delivery drivers. In 2021, Amazon installed AI cameras in all delivery vans (the Netradyne “Driveri” system) to watch drivers on their routes ￼. These cameras use computer vision to detect 16 different safety infractions or “events” – from following too closely or illegal U-turns to not wearing a seatbelt, yawning, or looking at a phone ￼. The device records 100% of the time while on route and automatically flags clips of any triggering behavior to management ￼. It even issues voice commands to the driver in real time, like “Maintain safe distance!” or “Please slow down!” ￼. If the AI catches a driver yawning, it will instruct them to pull over for a 15-minute break – and if they don’t, the system notifies the boss, who may follow up with a call ￼. Amazon claims this is for safety, but drivers have complained of feeling constantly watched and judged by a “robot.” One driver said the invasive surveillance “drove him to quit,” calling it an unacceptable breach of privacy ￼. Privacy advocates note that AI is often error-prone in interpreting human behavior, which raises fairness issues when a machine’s judgment can trigger write-ups. (What if the camera misreads a reflection as a phone in hand, or a glance away from the road as distraction?) Even Amazon’s delivery algorithms assign and sequence routes without human input, pressuring drivers to meet algorithmically optimized delivery windows that leave little room for breaks or unforeseen delays.

Gig economy platforms are similarly governed by algorithms. Ride-hail and delivery drivers for companies like Uber often deal with an opaque “robo-boss.” The app tracks metrics like ride acceptance rate, cancellation rate, customer ratings, on-time deliveries, etc., and can automatically issue penalties or deactivation. In 2021, a Dutch court found that Uber “unlawfully dismissed” several drivers purely based on an algorithmic fraud detection system ￼. The drivers were accused of fraud by the app and terminated without a human review, which the court ruled violated their rights – ordering Uber to reinstate them with compensation ￼ ￼. Notably, the decision cited that Uber’s firing was “based solely on automated processing, including profiling,” breaching European data protection laws ￼. This case highlights that algorithms can be faulty – in one instance, Uber’s system flagged a driver for account sharing simply because of two login attempts from different locations ￼. Algorithms may also exhibit bias: Uber and other platforms have used facial recognition for driver identity verification, which has been reported to falsely fail drivers with darker skin tones, disproportionately hurting those workers ￼. Around the world, gig workers and unions are pushing back on these automated management practices, arguing that workers shouldn’t be at the mercy of an unaccountable algorithm.

AI-Based Performance Scoring and Ranking

Beyond direct surveillance, AI is used to crunch the data on worker performance and sometimes rank or rate employees. Modern workplaces collect huge datasets on worker productivity – number of units produced, calls handled, sales closed, emails sent, time spent on each task, and so on. With machine learning, companies can analyze this trove to find patterns or predict who the “best” performers are. However, this can easily stray into automated scorekeeping that workers experience as oppressive. We saw the Amazon and Microsoft examples: Amazon’s internal dashboards that rate pickers by speed (even tracking if an item scan happens within 1.25 seconds of the previous item) ￼, or Microsoft’s Productivity Score that assigned each employee a performance index out of 100 (until adjusted under criticism). There are also startups offering “productivity analytics” services to enterprises – essentially, data dashboards grading every worker. Some companies have experimented with composite performance scores to decide promotions or layoffs.

The concern is that reducing humans to numbers often ignores context and creates perverse incentives. Workers may feel forced to optimize their metrics at all costs. As one privacy expert observed about the Microsoft scoring system, “this encourages employees to work for the algorithm to get a better score rather than for their employer,” undermining trust and morale ￼ ￼. Amazon’s warehouse scoring has been blamed for injuries and high turnover – workers skip bathroom breaks or proper ergonomic movements to avoid downtime, contributing to a reportedly elevated injury rate in Amazon facilities. And if an AI-driven performance model is biased or inaccurate, it could unfairly label good workers as “low performers.” Since these systems are often opaque, workers might not even know why they were flagged or how to dispute a bad rating. That lack of transparency feeds a sense of helplessness.

Ethical, Privacy, and Labor Concerns

The spread of AI surveillance in workplaces raises numerous ethical and legal concerns. Below are some of the key issues being debated:
	•	Invasion of Privacy: Constant monitoring – of one’s face, voice, screen, or physical location – erodes employees’ privacy. Practices like recording workers on camera all day or logging every keystroke create a sense of being watched at all times, even during small breaks or personal moments. France’s privacy regulator recently fined Amazon’s warehouse arm €32 million for an “excessively intrusive” monitoring system that tracked every moment of employee inactivity and speed, ruling it illegal to require justification for “every break or interruption.” ￼ ￼ Such pervasive surveillance can cross the line into personal space and data that employees reasonably expect to keep private (e.g. one’s facial expressions or biometric data).
	•	Erosion of Autonomy and Dignity: When workers know an AI is timing their bathroom breaks or scoring their smiles in a meeting, it can be deeply dehumanizing. It treats people like cogs to be optimized by data. This undermines autonomy, as workers feel they have little control or trust. A policy analyst warned that invasive, ongoing surveillance “undermines employees’ autonomy and basic human dignity.” ￼ Workers may self-censor and behave robotically to avoid triggering the monitoring system, rather than exercise judgment or creativity. This can crush morale and create a culture of fear.
	•	Stress and Mental Health: The pressure of round-the-clock surveillance can lead to anxiety, stress, and burnout. Knowing that every pause or mistake might be flagged by an algorithm, workers may experience constant tension. Studies have likened this to a digital “panopticon” effect, where the feeling of always being watched forces people to discipline themselves in unhealthy ways. High-paced algorithmic management (as in Amazon’s case) also often means unrealistic productivity quotas that workers strain themselves to meet, risking physical injury or mental exhaustion. Monitoring software can even spill into after-hours: some remote employees report feeling guilty or afraid to step away from the keyboard for even a minute during work hours, since the inactivity alert might go off.
	•	Accuracy and Bias Problems: AI surveillance technologies are not foolproof. Facial recognition is known to be less accurate for women and people of color, which could lead to biased outcomes (e.g. a facial-attendance system falsely marking some workers absent or emotion recognition mislabeling certain ethnic facial expressions as “angry”). AI cameras may misinterpret harmless behaviors as violations – for instance, Amazon’s driver camera might flag a driver as distracted for looking at a side mirror. If workers are penalized based on flawed AI judgments, that is clearly unjust. Yet in many cases, the algorithms’ inner workings are opaque, and workers have limited ability to contest an automated decision. This lack of due process is a core ethical issue.
	•	Labor Rights and Power Imbalance: Ubiquitous surveillance tips the balance of power heavily toward employers. Companies hold all the data and can use it to their advantage – whether in disciplinary action or in discouraging organizing. There is evidence that some employers use surveillance data to sniff out union sympathizers or collective activity, infringing on workers’ right to organize ￼. The NLRB’s General Counsel cautioned that if monitoring is so pervasive that it “significantly impairs or negates employees’ ability to engage in protected [organizing] activity”, it violates labor law ￼. Additionally, when firings or evaluations are driven by inscrutable algorithms, it undermines traditional labor protections. How can a worker claim unfair termination if the reason is hidden in a black-box model’s output? Unions and labor advocates argue that workers must have a voice in how these technologies are implemented – or else face “extreme asymmetries of power” between surveilled workers and all-seeing employers ￼.
	•	Data Security and Secondary Use: Collecting more data on employees creates risks of that data being misused or breached. Sensitive information (face scans, health indicators, personal communications) might be stored insecurely or repurposed by the company in ways employees never agreed to. For example, could a productivity score be later used to decide layoffs during a downturn? Could camera footage be reviewed to find reasons to deny a worker’s compensation claim? Without strict limits, the function creep of surveillance data is a real concern.

In sum, worker surveillance AI tends to put profit and efficiency before people, raising profound ethical questions. Unlike consumer surveillance (where at least users get a “free” service in exchange for data), employees often have no choice but to submit to monitoring to keep their jobs ￼ ￼. This dynamic can quickly lead to what researchers call a “pernicious form of power”: an information asymmetry where the employer knows everything and the worker knows very little, enabling near-total control over workers’ lives ￼ ￼.

Impact on the Future of Work: Empowerment or Exploitation?

Given these trends, a central question emerges: will AI in the workplace empower workers, or exploit them? The reality may depend on how society chooses to manage this technology in the coming years.

On one hand, AI tools have the potential to augment workers’ abilities and relieve drudgery. For example, AI could automate routine tasks (scheduling, data entry, basic customer queries), freeing employees to focus on higher-value or creative work. Intelligent systems might provide workers with real-time feedback for their own benefit – such as alerting a factory worker if their posture risks injury, or reminding a driver to take a fatigue break for safety (and not punishing them for it). Some optimists argue that AI could “empower your workforce” by handling the grunt work and enabling more flexible, remote collaboration. In an ideal scenario, transparency and data access could allow employees to use surveillance data to improve their own efficiency or demonstrate their contributions during evaluations. AI could even reduce human biases in promotions or hiring if used carefully, by focusing on performance data over personal impressions.

On the other hand, the current trajectory suggests an exploitative tilt. Thus far, many AI surveillance implementations have been designed top-down, by employers for employers, with scant input from workers. The emphasis has been on squeezing out extra productivity – often translating to workers being pushed to work harder and faster, sometimes to a breaking point. Without legal and organizational checks, there is little incentive for employers to use these technologies in truly worker-centric ways. As researcher Kate Crawford observed, beyond the much-discussed risk of AI causing job loss, there is “the creation of workplaces with increasingly extreme asymmetries of power between workers and employers.” ￼ In such workplaces, AI becomes a tool of exploitation – monitoring every move, setting unyielding benchmarks, and treating humans as optimized units of input. The endgame of unrestrained surveillance capitalism in the workplace could be a world where workers are algorithmically micromanaged to maximize output, with any who fall behind efficiently culled. That is a dystopia of low-trust, high-control work environments, and it could undermine job satisfaction, creativity, and genuine productivity in the long run.

Crucially, whether AI empowers or exploits will depend on governance. As one analyst put it, “technology holds out the promise of freedom from drudgery for all – but we can only harness its liberatory potential if we give workers and the public a say in how it is used.” ￼ ￼ If workers have a seat at the table – through stronger unions, works councils, or employee privacy rights – AI could be implemented with guardrails that protect dignity and fairness. For instance, an employer could use AI to identify training opportunities or ergonomic improvements, rather than just to surveil and punish. There is also a burgeoning market for “ethical AI” tools that incorporate privacy by design (e.g. on-device analytics that don’t send personal data to the cloud) or that focus on aggregate trends instead of individual tracking.

Regulation and Responses

Governments and regulators around the world are waking up to the challenges posed by AI-driven workplace surveillance. The response so far includes new laws, enforcement actions, and public debate:
	•	Data Protection Enforcement: In regions with strong privacy laws (like Europe), regulators have started cracking down on overly intrusive workplace AI. The French Data Protection Authority (CNIL)’s €32M fine against Amazon France Logistique in 2023 is a high-profile example ￼. CNIL ruled that Amazon’s minute-by-minute tracking of warehouse workers’ inactivity violated GDPR’s principles of proportionality and transparency, and it also faulted Amazon for constant video surveillance without proper employee information or security safeguards ￼ ￼. This sends a message that even powerful companies must balance efficiency with employees’ privacy rights. Similar investigations are underway in other EU countries into practices like webcam monitoring of remote employees. In Italy and Spain, courts have ruled against employers for secretly filming or recording workers. Notably, the EU’s GDPR (Article 22) gives employees the right not to be subject to fully automated decisions that significantly affect them (such as algorithmic firings) without human review – the very clause used in the Dutch court case against Uber’s algorithmic firing of drivers ￼.
	•	AI-Specific Rules: The European Union is also finalizing a landmark AI Act which will impose strict requirements on high-risk AI systems, including those used for employment-related monitoring and management. Under the current draft, AI systems used to make decisions about hiring, firing, promotion, task allocation, or performance evaluation are classified as “high risk.” This will require employers deploying them to conduct impact assessments, ensure human oversight, and notify workers about the use of AI ￼ ￼. If an AI system is too opaque or deemed too risky (for instance, emotion recognition for HR purposes), it might even be prohibited or heavily regulated. These regulations aim to prevent a Wild West of workplace AI and ensure some accountability.
	•	Labor Law and Worker Rights: Labor regulators are also stepping in. In the United States, while no comprehensive federal privacy law exists for employees, the National Labor Relations Board is leveraging labor law to address surveillance. In October 2022, the NLRB’s General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo issued a memo asserting that excessively intrusive electronic monitoring can violate workers’ right to organize ￼. She instructed NLRB regions to consider employers presumptively at fault if their surveillance “would have a tendency to interfere with Section 7 rights” (the right to collective action) ￼. This could mean an employer who, say, uses an AI system to closely track conversations or movements might be forced to scale back if it deters union activity. The General Counsel specifically cited examples like keyloggers, webcam photos, and algorithms that discipline for taking breaks as concerning uses ￼. While this NLRB framework is still evolving, it suggests regulators may require that if monitoring is in place, workers must be informed and certain activities (like private organizing talks) not be spied on. Separately, unions in various sectors are negotiating collective bargaining agreements that limit digital monitoring or set guidelines for algorithmic fairness. For instance, gig worker unions in Europe have pushed for “algorithmic transparency” clauses forcing companies to explain how automated systems evaluate them.
	•	Transparency and Consent Laws: Some jurisdictions have passed laws mandating at least disclosure of monitoring. In New York State, a law that took effect in May 2022 requires employers to notify new hires in writing if their phone, email, or internet usage will be monitored ￼ ￼. It doesn’t ban surveillance, but it ensures employees aren’t being watched without their knowledge. California’s updated privacy law (CPRA) now gives employees the right to request and delete personal data employers hold on them, which could include monitoring data, potentially giving workers more insight and control. Internationally, countries like France have long required that worker surveillance be proportional and subject to prior consultation with employee representatives. As another example, Ontario, Canada amended its laws in 2022 to require organizations to spell out their electronic monitoring policies to employees. These transparency measures are a start, though critics argue they don’t go far enough if workers can’t refuse or negotiate the terms of surveillance.
	•	Lawsuits and Legal Precedents: Individual and class-action lawsuits are shaping the boundaries as well. Apart from the biometric suits under Illinois’ BIPA, there have been cases tackling whether certain surveillance violates “reasonable expectation of privacy” or other rights. Some employees have sued for constructive dismissal, claiming the stress of 24/7 monitoring made their work conditions intolerable. While case law is still developing, even the threat of litigation pressures companies to moderate their surveillance practices (for example, by anonymizing data or purging it regularly to reduce liability).
	•	Public Pressure and Corporate Policy Changes: Negative publicity and employee backlash have in some cases led companies to reverse or revise AI monitoring initiatives. Microsoft’s retreat on Productivity Score after it was labeled a “privacy nightmare” ￼ shows that tech giants are sensitive to being seen as enabling Big Brother. Google, famously, has long provided perks to employees and shied away from heavy-handed monitoring in order to cultivate a culture of trust (though even they have faced protests over tracking of internal activism). As awareness grows, more workers may voice objections to extreme surveillance, pushing employers to find a better balance to attract and retain talent. Ethical AI certifications or audits could become a badge companies use to show they are “responsible AI” employers, not digital sweatshops.

In summary, regulators are playing catch-up but making important moves to address AI-powered workplace surveillance. The approaches range from privacy-centric (data protection fines and AI regulations) to labor-centric (worker rights and collective bargaining). It’s a recognition that without intervention, the default trajectory of surveillance capitalism could seriously undermine worker rights and wellbeing. As one labor advocate commented on the Uber algorithm firing case, “This case is a wake-up call for lawmakers about the abuse of surveillance technology now proliferating in the gig economy.” ￼

Conclusion

AI has undeniably arrived in the workplace, and with it a profound power to watch and analyze workers as never before. From facial recognition cameras tracking warehouse workers’ every move to algorithms that dispatch and discipline gig drivers, these technologies can fundamentally reshape the nature of work. The central promise of AI in business is greater efficiency – but when efficiency is pursued above all else, workers can become victims of a digital Taylorism that treats them as data points rather than human beings. The examples highlighted – Amazon’s TOT system, AI cameras that chastise drivers for yawning, software that logs every keystroke – show that this is not a theoretical concern for the future; it’s happening now across industries like manufacturing, logistics, and even white-collar offices.

Whether AI ends up empowering or exploiting workers will depend on the choices companies and policymakers make now. There is potential for AI to enhance safety, reduce drudgery, and provide fairer assessments, if implemented with care for employees’ rights and input. However, left unchecked, the current trend points toward AI being a tool of intensified surveillance and control – a lever to extract ever more labor from workers while eroding their privacy and agency. The challenge ahead is to democratize workplace AI – to set rules and norms such that workers share in the benefits of AI instead of merely being subjected to it. This will likely require stronger laws (like those emerging in Europe), collective worker action to demand transparency and fairness, and a rethinking of what worker wellbeing means in the age of data.

In the end, a balance must be struck between legitimate business interests in productivity and the fundamental human right to privacy and dignity at work. The rise of AI-powered surveillance capitalism has tilted that balance toward employers, but awareness and regulatory momentum are growing to correct course. The story is still being written. As AI continues to permeate the workplace, society’s response – in laws, in corporate ethics, and in worker empowerment – will decide if this technology ushers in a new era of collaboration between humans and machines, or simply a new form of digital exploitation on the job.

I am a culture minority at this job  which may or may not have something to do with how I’m being treated. 
When I first met my coworker, he was upset about something and dropped something dramatically make a noise which startled me. He saw that it shocked me. He looked calmly and said something along the lines of “it’s ok, I’m not going to hurt you”.
After that it took me along time to warm up to him but I did. We would both be in early in the morning sometimes and he would buy me a coffee for covering him, when he went out for a smoke.
Every now and then he would do something to grab my attention, like when I’m super focused. Like he would hand me something and hold on to it till I looked at him. Which for some reason would make me smile because I’d realize I was completely in my head. Every now and then he’d give me a look and smile or just a look and I can’t read him. I thought maybe he was flirting but he’s in a serious relationship and I’ve seen him be cold to women who tried to flirt with him.

I started noticing that I’m the one that always initiates the “morning how are you” or “have a good night” or any conversation for that matter. Sometimes I would say hi, and he wouldn’t say anything at all. He is known for being a very crabby person by everyone. Usually I considered his crabby behavior kind of humorous because there seems to be no reason for it and his sarcastic behavior can be funny. Although I started noticing that he seems to have no problem starting conversations and saying hi to others but not me sometimes.

One day I got really annoyed. He was carrying out a conversation with someone right next to me and completely ignored my existence and didn’t include me in the convo which is the polite thing to do. He even mentioned the new person that just started was fun to talk to. She happens to be from the same culture as him. 

I decided to try behaving the same way he was treating me. I think he noticed a bit but still didn’t do the bare minimum of being nice to me, which is just to say “hi” when we work together.
I can’t keep being as rude as he is. I don’t have it in me and I’m not understanding why I’m getting treated the way that I am. 

Would love thoughts on this because I don’t know what to do. When someone treats me this way, my instinct is to be nicer because it calms my nervous system to make people happy and nice to me. But I don’t want to be treated like crap and I shouldn’t have to put up with it either.

Create training is now broken. Please help! (Video)","Puppy is 8 weeks old, female, beagle mix (went through local dog rescue). 

I live in a town home with neighbors on two sides. So I have no choice but to keep crying to a minimum. 

The first day I had her, crate training went really well. I was able to associate it with high value. She went into the crate voluntarily to sleep.

It's day three, and I'm worried all this is going downhill, and I will lose positive association with the crate. I *need* the crate to work.

We start the morning with training before feeding so I can use her food as incentive. This only works for a few minutes. After a little bit she gets restless, feisty, and won't eat her kibble. Then she starts to wander off. I have her on a house line to control her. As soon as I stop her with the house line, she starts to cry. So I switch to higher value treats (Little Jack's chicken liver bits). This works again only a few times. So I switch to a higher value reward, canned chicken. This is the only thing that's working, but at this point she needs to eat her actual food. I don't think I can just give her plain chicken as her main diet (or can I? I don't know). 

So at this point training is a bust, and I need to get my morning going. I need to brush my teeth, shower, make coffee, etc. I **have to** put her in a crate. I wet her kibble using warm water to make it a little more appealing, and put it in her crate. This morning she would not follow it in. So I had to put her in, and close the door. She immediately starts crying, which escalates to screaming. I have to go get the other crate from upstairs and bring it downstairs to where I work (I work from home by the way).

I have to put her in in the crate in this closet because now she's crying, screaming in fact, and this is the only place in my home that doesn't share walls with neighbors. I try again to do the recommended crate training to reward her for being calm in her crate. Nothing, and I mean nothing is working. 

I don't know what I'll do if crate training doesn't work. I don't want to have to rehome her. What am I doing wrong ? Please help. ",0,1740496212.0,puppy101,8,0.5,False

1ixx6bb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mehakunfiltered/comments/1ixx6bb/designing_from_the_depths_of_my_bed_a_creative/,Designing from the Depths of My Bed: A Creative Chaos,"There’s something about the way inspiration sneaks up on you when you least expect it. For me, it arrived unannounced as I lay sprawled across my bed, laptop precariously placed beside me, my body angled in a way that defied ergonomic wisdom. Some call it lazy; I call it creative immersion.



The bed, my sanctuary of comfort, had transformed into an unconventional design studio. Sketchbooks, fabric swatches, and half-drunk cups of coffee formed a chaotic yet familiar ecosystem around me. My laptop screen flickered, illuminating my face with an ethereal glow—partially from the design software, partially from the countless tabs open in search of that one perfect reference image.



With my head propped up by a pillow, I traced patterns onto my tablet, watching them come to life on the screen. There’s something oddly thrilling about working from this angle—half in a dream state, half immersed in creativity. My mind danced between soft folds of inspiration, much like the fabric I envisioned draping across an imagined silhouette.



Designing from bed is not just about comfort; it’s about redefining the workspace. Who said great ideas only emerge from stiff office chairs and sterile desks? Some of my best concepts have been born between tangled sheets, where thoughts flow freely, unrestricted by formality. It’s a rebellion against the notion that creativity needs structure. Here, in this little bubble of comfort, I sketch, erase, undo, and redo until my vision finally clicks into place.



But of course, the creative chaos comes with its share of challenges. The occasional laptop slide threatens to bring my entire digital world crashing down. The deceptive warmth of my blanket tries to lull me into an afternoon nap. Yet, amidst all this, magic happens. My fingers move in rhythm with my thoughts, translating my imagination into reality, one stroke at a time.



As I complete the final details, I sit up, stretching like an artist who has just finished their masterpiece. The bed-studio may not be conventional, but it’s mine. It’s where my ideas breathe, where my designs take shape, and where creativity flows in the most unfiltered, raw, and authentic form.



So, the next time someone questions your unconventional workspace, just remind them—some of the best ideas are born in the most unexpected places. And as I glance at my screen, satisfied with what I’ve created, I know one thing for sure: today, my bed wasn’t just a place to rest. It was my creative battlefield.

Xia Fei has led me down a rabbit hole, so i figured i might share my insights, cus they are prolly very wrong, but also very funny.

it all started with fei. i am watching with english subtitles so there is no pinyin anywhere and its impossible to hear any tones while everyone is talking normally at least at my skill level.

so naturally fei is fei. i know fei. its the 2nd half of coffee. 咖啡. i even know fei means strong fragrance. so xia fei means >!""xia smells nice"" or alternatively ""xia stinks"".!<

>!and he is an engineering student so you know its ""stinks"".!<

and while i dont know xia, 茶 sounds basically the same. so his name is cha fei. meaning >!""stinky tea"".!<

but then i googled and fei means beautiful. and xia might be summer, tho it could be big as well.

cheng xiaoshi, according to my research, could be translated to >!""small (xiao 小) journey (cheng 程) thru/in time (shi 时)"".!< which is very meta. tho xiaoshi can also mean ""hour"", which would make his name way less cool

but if you take xiaoshi and un-chinese it cus no pinyin, then it could be xiao shi (to be/ exist 是) meaning you could translate it as ""small being"", which is prolly very chinesen't but also very canonically correct. just look at him.

lu guang becomes quite interesting. cus i could only really find ""land"" for lu, which would make sense cus he is basically the anchor. and guang is from shiguang, meaning time. but it could also mean ""light/shining/brilliant"". and his japanese name is hikaru, which means ""light""

so you could translate lu guang as >!""shining land/ land of light""!<, which could maybe be >!heaven!<.

and then we have qiao ling. and i kid you not, the only thing aside from ""joe ling"" i could find was >!""big fungus""!<

this just has to be wrong

>!so in short, season 3 is gonna star ""big and beautiful"", ""small being"", ""shiny land"" and ""big fungus"" as our main cast (hopefully).!<",3,1740496154.0,LinkClick,2,1.0,False

We always have fun at work. I’m 10 years older than her, but I’m very immature for my age. I specially wanted like a little sister figure, since my real younger sister stopped speaking to me, so I looked out for companionship from this girl. One of the things that kind of annoyed me about her was that she hangs out with a lot of people from work (specially men), yet she seems to be always too busy to hang out with me (my schedule is way worse than hers, as I am superior). But I see her stories hanging out with different types of people, and it bothers me, because she’s always close to me, always wants shifts with me at work, but outside, it’s like she doesn’t want a friendship. I’m a lonely person who has very little friendships, relationships, and so I’m always striving to make real connections anywhere possible, I even stopped speaking to certain women because they just treated my time as an afterthought, and never really wanted to hang out with me; so I stopped the relationship- because just like I would do with men; you’re either with me 100% or you’re not and we can just be people who know each other. I don’t want half assed relationships. I deserve to be loved and appreciated. 
Another thing that really annoys me about her is the fact that she says every single man at work wants her. Like she sends me screenshots of men from work always wanting to “grab a beer with her”- not coffee, not dinner, but beer. It’s odd because she’s always telling me that if I like a certain guy, I should ask him out for a beer. So it seems to me like she’s actually going after them, inviting them, and they respond, but she creates this narrative that they are the ones after her, and she just doesn’t like them. Like they are creepy, she’s just an innocent little girl who flirts with them, and they just get the wrong idea. Oh by the way; she’s a Blake lively fan, so I guess that should tell you who she is. Some of these dudes I have sort of liked before, but never made a move, because I’m insecure about my looks. However, according to her, they confess their undying love for her and she is just creeped out by every single one of them, because they just get the wrong idea. 
I once knew a girl like this in college who would use guys she really didn’t like so they can pay for dates, get her gifts, and they all were allegedly in love with her and she didn’t reciprocate their feelings. I tolerated it until she went after the guy I was dating who was my first love and my first time. Right there and then I decided to stop speaking to her. Mind you I was 19 back then. But it’s just a matter of time before she goes after a guy I’m dating or hanging out with, and I don’t think I’ll be as gentle as I was with the girl from college. 
Anyways, I’ve never had issues with women like this in the sense that they go after the same men, but this girls narrative is actually dangerous because she can one day falsely accuse a guy of sexual harassment at work. ",3,1740496151.0,FriendshipAdvice,16,1.0,False

All this to say, my pants feel a tiny bit less tight but I still feel the stomach touching the fabric uncomfortably.

I feel like after nearly 3 months of eating so much less I’d see a bigger difference.  

I’d say the dose is still too low but wouldn’t eating so much less be working already?  ",1,1740495763.0,Semaglutide,2,1.0,False

I have a lot of patience for her because my kids were happy accidents. I cannot imagine how horrible ten years of fertility treatments was.

I go over for coffee at least once a week. Today she was excitedly showing me her latest baby gear haul, and she invited me upstairs to check out the nursery. It is a beautifully painted underwater scene, with baby’s name included. 

The name is Ahdyssonne. Pronounced Addison.

In addition, baby’s middle name starts with S, as does the last name. So Ahdyssonne’s initials will be ASS.

I’m currently crocheting an amigurumi octopus for the nursery, and I had considered embroidering baby’s name on a tentacle.

1ixwzgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/FifaCareers/comments/1ixwzgj/build_this_team_thank_me_later/,Build this team. Thank me later.,"This is the one ladies and gents. The team you've all been looking for. You'll be slingin' more silverware than your local china shop. Let me explain...

To preface, I have been playing career mode for many years. Typical douchebaggery by starting with Real Madrid and buying all the highest potential players - gets boring quickly. Recently over the years, I've found growing young/talented players to be much more satisfying. Especially players that I haven't heard of or haven't seen play in real life that are underrated in game. I have started and ended countless saves on FC25 Career Mode in search of a team so euphoric, with players that feel like they were born in a lab with their level of chemistry and that make career mode fun and engaging again. I have built this team up far past this but this photo depicts their early ratings and they all have potentials in the low-high 80's. However, even at their lower ratings, they all easily play 10+ ratings above that they are.

The back 3 are a trio made of gold and sex (the good kind). All pacey, strong and Silva/Spileers are extremely strong in the air. Khusanov is a bullet once he gets up to speed. No winger, striker or anyone has successfully outrun him and wow, what a great feeling that is.

Prestianni and Koleosho are unexplainably the best wingers in the game. You'll just have to see for yourself. God only birthed Usain Bolt to humble Minteh. This man is not human. He is simply a machine. Schjelderup is also a sleeper. Wonderful finesse shot and great dribbling. Excellent back up winger. As a Benfica fan it's extra special to see.

Gruda and Karetsas ARE THE GREATEST CAM PAIRING IN THIS GAME. YOU CANNOT AND WILL NOT CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE. The Oxford dictionary has one pressing issue - it lacks ANY word to describe what Karestsas is like with a ball at his feet. Need to dribble through the entire team? Karetsas. Need to thread the needle? Karetsas. Need a 92nd minute banger from 30 yards that leaves the keeper planted? Karetsas. I don't know what he puts in his coffee but I'm certain you and I don't have access to it. Gruda reminds me of a lefty Musiala. Decent pace but MY GOD when he is on the ball, angels sing. A 5 star skiller to boot and what a left boot on this lad.

Kostoulas is FANTASTIC. His positioning is incredible. He is always in the right place at the right time and consistently making the perfect runs. He has a wonderful mix of pace, shooting and some aerial ability that make him the most complete, young striker I have used (Conrad Harder is not far off - you're welcome). Ilenikhena is somewhat of an ""Mbappe"". Blitzing speed, whacker of a left foot and not a bad dribbler either. Fantastic at those ""cross net"" goals between the edge of the 18 and the 6 yard box.

You may have noticed I haven't brought up my holding midfield yet. Well that's because I have saved the best for last. You probably thought I was hot and horny for Karetsas... tisk, tisk, tisk, you silly Reddit consumer. Let me list a few things I would do to keep this midfield pairing at my club:

1. Give up my first born child and any in perpetuity
2. Medically fuse Lego to my bare feet in a world where wheels don't exist
3. Jump into a body of water handcuffed with 200kg tied to my ankle

The list goes on and becomes quite extensive but I'll leave it there. I promise you, Bergvall and Bouaddi are what dreams are made of. They seem to almost have their own link up play. Like they are a team of 2, plus 9 others. It makes no sense. They are always open, always tracking back, always on a man and they both excel during defensive play or attacking play. Bouaddi is the new Gullit. People here that have experience playing with Gullit know how much of a statement and compliment that is and what it means. Anything is possible with Bouaddi - anything. Bergvall is this beautiful symphony of blond Swedish hair and piercing blue eyes, Argentinian-esque ball control, Brazilian dribbling, Spanish passing and whatever country has fuckin good shooting.

May I present to you - the best team on career mode. Thank you.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Are there any Bojack Horsman fans on this subreddit? 
For those interested, all the little references I tried to put in his rooms:
BH:
-outfits: I tried to recreate his outfit as best I could, the donkey hat for the horse's head and I think the colors of the sweaters really resemble those of Bojack. Now the less obvious: his newspaper-shaped accessory refers to the newspaper episode (a bit obvious when you put it like that, ahah)
-his villa: the pool, the deckchairs, the palm trees, to make the terrace of his Hollywood villa
-shooting decor: we all know that bojack has a problem with alcohol, but I also tried to represent the episode where BH does a shoot for an advert in his villa for a brand of alcohol and ends up completely drunk and kind of forgetting his lines (hence the script paper has feet : )
-Penny: the little doe is there to represent penny and the shiny balloons, in the prom ball episode (again alcohol everywhere, works well with this episode too)
-the little party hat: it's in PC's room too because it represents Todd. Normally his hat is yellow but with his red vest, I think it matches his colors pretty well.
PC's room:
-Outfits: the pink hair to recall her little streak, the yellow bows to recall her color code. For the dress I did the best I could to match her iconic dress, and the little coffee mug to recall her stressful lifestyle.
-Hedgehog: “Princess Caroline's secret project”, PC's adopted child and the mess it has made of her life (note the little bottle of milk and the oven mitt PC uses to carry her baby) 
-office: I tried to recreate her office in her agency with Judas, even if you can also see a frog representing her former assistant. Also the frame on the wall with a fish to recall the patern of her dress. 

I think that's all ahah ( it's already very long). Making these rooms made me want to see jewelry, like a necklace as an accessory, I think it could be pretty. 
Please give me your suggestions for these rooms and if any of you have a room, concerning this series I would love to see it!!!! 
( I'm now thinking of doing a room for todd and diane, the Belle room for diane but I'll need a bit more inspiration for them both ahah)

Thought it would be good for us to put our findings in one place for easy lookup. 

We know the following:

Must be logged in as an annual subscriber, and it must be on a pc (or mac presumably), not on a phone.  

Process: from the ticket listing: click Get Code, Copy Code, Buy Tickets

Questions:

1) Any tips on best browser to use?

2) do we have to refresh the tickets page once the onsale starts, in order to get access?

3) does it help to login to ticketbastard in advance?



Edit:
I got through using my Mac safari browser.  Here was the process:

Re-subscribed last night (had let it lapse when my credit card expired).  So today, I logged in via my subscription confirmation email.  Not sure if that was necessary, but couldn’t hurt.  

Had to hit refresh many times to get the tickets loaded (and fucked around going to the contrarian page to re-access the tickets page to see if that would help).  

Once the tickets loaded I had to repeatedly click Get Codes.  Took about 5 tries (with about a minute of the spindle icon in between each before the code emerged.  

I had trouble with the Copy Code function, so I just took a picture, then clicked Get Tickets, and typed in the code when prompted.  

Got great tix for a fair price and though it was stressful, i was in my home drinking a coffee, so, I’m pleased.  Neil does shit his own way, and better this than having ticketbastard front the presale.

Elevate office garage sale to “pop-up secondhand sale” - ideas?

I have two lifestyle hobbies - flipping select things for fun and a bit of profit (Vans and Converse shoes), and making sustainability fun, a bit more exciting, and give it a “something out of nothing” vibe.

I want to upscale the office sale into something nicer, but maybe I need ideas besides what I’ve got.

My office wants to hold a garage sale in September. We’re a national non-profit and I’m also seeing this as an opportunity to get the community together, as well as rally and use our volunteer base. That’s step one in convincing my boss.

I help run a plus size clothing swap in town, and I elevated it with clothing racks, signs for size sections, a tall rack for dresses/bags/really nice stuff, a standing mirror, and a speaker and playlist. Once I even did an urn of coffee in the winter and it was a hit. 

I want to add that to our sale, plus some string lights for the mirror, lemonade/coffee stand outside (add a bake sale element, too,) and make sure the tables are ordered by “section” (electronics, books, clothes, kitchen, etc.) I have accessory stands and some table risers and boxes to make sure things are displayed well and orderly.

I am also planning to rope in local businesses and see if they will give us some of their clearance/writeoff product that hasn’t sold so we can try and make a few dollars on them, and they can have a tax receipt. I feel new product would really sell the pop-up feel.

What else should I be considering? If I have one more idea to make money - maybe a little raffle? - it would pitch much better. What do you like to see at a sale?",1,1740495395.0,partyplanning,0,1.0,False

In Dollet There Somewhere the Invasion of The Lunatic Pandora is nowadays still visible in the Régiment of the Force Majour Town where it is clearly to be seen for example in The Architecture of the Youngian Infrastructure for instance as how all the Buildings are looking out. The Red Brick Buildings share shape and size and have been rapped over with a thin layer of cement before painting with red and green.
  The Invasion took Place only 80 Years Ago but there's more to It, because it has happened Sakes for About 100 Years Period of Time. Could this be explained as a contemplation of an apropos on two different Circles of Power urging their need to Gain Control and maintaining it over the Seas, in any way for a commoner?
  Noway the locals wanna hear about how the ""Moon Screamer"" may land their parking lots. Not the Old Fashioned people may talk about it without getting exhausted. Impossible it may be to explain a phrase without furtherly getting held forming anonymous point of view.
  This is How His Pen wrote an article for the newspaper in A Coffee Quarter where it was about a solid amount/quality relation of the bean. The place was about an atmosphere that belonged in An European Asphalt Jungle. It was quite the same as in Berlin and in Budapest. The only difference between these different Cities was as a matter of a fact the language barrier, because the folks wouldn't intuitively understand english if You got tangled over the discourse like ""No speak english"" or ""No understand"". Lots and lots of people would be able to help any commoner around this barrier, but of course the easiest way for a journeyman was just to ignore the ""Don't Speak"" and keep the quest ongoing.
  Laguna didn't mind himself a cold cup of coffee. They brew earlier and here in this hemisphere in between the area of a chilly Youngian Architecture and the sort of a Geographicaly more seasoned Nature Inhabitant would not only call A cups a-r-e cold, but aswell A cups will c-a-t-c-h cold.
  The People Who located around this political surrounding that kept growing not just from the Town of Dollet or the two bigger Cities of Berlin and Budapest too from A Country to another where They didn't mention That Brexit hadn't really removed the English Folklore from this Land, Boris.
  The language was evrywhere to be seen like for example in the malls groceries labels and etiquettes as well as the public transportation guide and info. One could even hear it, because the mainstream music had their lyrics written in english.

  The Correspondents jacket was blue and his trousers brown. He didn't keep them as his favorite colors though. The fact that explained this combination of an unicode lay in the color theory, because one could mix colors that provoked other peoples imagination. There was a sort of an old school knick to use brown as a cover for the other item unicode, because that color mixed all the other ones. The trick was to use blue and orange first in order to combine an unicode from two opponent colors and second switch the other one with brown. This way using the opposing color circle items you were able to suit up in the antabusian. Last season?
  Penpal touched the Paper on A Moleskin booklet. Laguna drew scetches of oldish symbols to remind him what adds up with his subject. On the other hand side of the machine he would use for writing an article there on the table was a magazine from a small local press. Pipo Copper was performing this weekend. They were really trying to pay the war debt so it seemed. Not the old folks home, but the brotherhood.
  The life he thought to himself. It had a flavour to it. Evryday life was about surviving coming up with a justification. Othervice you were dead at the end of the day. One had to be able to limit break an adaptable margin that was commonly held as Good, True & Beautiful. The actual word would probably be A Convergence. According to the lifestrategy you might get intouch with the other, because working a convergence suitable enough it was possible to spend time together.
  He was a humanist that way. He would have to consider twice. There were people around who didn't adapt to lasayding so they would act like his person had transacted just the opposite what he had meant. Laguna reasoned the word basing on his experience that few big ideologies had caused an inconvergence about what he had figured up unwillingly to submit as his original idea.
  The Pipo Copper had arrived to Dollet on thursday. They hit the radio tower with their new single. The Reciever went wild up in the air during their performance. This Christmas Season it was going to be big. The military would take them most aprovingly welcomed after the first show, because of their therme that cut the costs in half.
  After the war had seized in the past the standard of living had been the lowest. Theoreticaly speaking history would solve this industrially and prove out as solving the problem. Practically speaking the monetary quality of living didn't return to normal if you came to consider what one didn't want to tell the others. It was a shame to lose.
  This time it had been different for raison de éther evry bit of the groups materials were home sewn. Not one little piece on their set list had been from the public market which was infiltrated with bad after-shave having a metallic side taste to any communality. Like grandfather.
  After the war time which lasted over four years the town was torn up from below. All the floors were burned in evry house. The forest around the site swarmed infantry that fled in the after match. As soon as it was over A tee cermony took place in the Town Hall where people may have cosulted an ambassador. A blue blooded family tree gathered royal ties up and held a concervation in their hand leading until now lasting treaty.
  Deuche arose from the ashes to take Rule Over Here, most due to a philosophy published only a few Years living after The military invasion. It was written by Epicnaras and its debatable if the original author's up-to-date in Her vision, because the Philosophy still Is popular as they come so myriad of 60's post publishers did renew its terminology.

  Today The Duchey of Dollet was all the best one might ever wish for. Sun was shining bright. Energious people strolling on the street some of them might stop by for a small talk. Laguna had sighted a beautiful family of two on the Townsquare. A Mother and A Daughter smiling back at him as he walked by the narrow streets of Dollet viewing inside from the sizeable windows the boutiques posessed. Him ignoring the mercaholico luxus.
  The charismatic Place he would from Time to time come to write for the Publisher wasn't too crowded in the morning though a few hours past midday it would be stuffed. The reason was their sandwiches the working class bought on the go from a concept vitrine from which evry customer just had to list what they wished for themselves and such a triangle bread would appear. The Dolletian Picadeli Nautilus was really much to his liking.
  His text was still in bits and the clock was slowly turning the tide from a quiet morning till a crowding as you could already hear the little door bell clinging to its high pitched tone ringing more and more usually. Customers chitchatting caused a craig in a little bit, and the window for the peace of working to end.
  Laguna packed away his writing machina. Survivor he thought to himself. He was feeling pretty good today. No remorse having a work that suits man well. Once again the door bell would happily nigh him leaving.
  Soon as the correspondent of the legion had passed The Via Fontaine Square he came by a dog who was barking at the air. He would turn his oculaire up without seeing anything in particular over around. It had reminded him a few years back about A distant pastime when he had run into resonant trouble. Out of thin air a few part time friends back in the Academy had been taken away from him by Forging an assault that was against Laguna. Again out of thin air a notorious man appeared in Court. He had eyed Loire with the right oculus and then told he needed to be in that room now.
  It had been a white jacket. The personal detail was a cronic blond hair. They say blondes have an assassins eye, but it's debatable in case the person has a genetical inheritance from Carelia. The land locates behind miles and miles in the periferia of the Forest East from Finland. Behind the European border. There's a zone of burnt ground that identifies as trash and big litter in between the borderland and the enigma reminding from the nomans land. Rumour has it carelians have green eyes. That's the other one of the knowledgings. It was a funny accident.
  Afterwards the trial Laguna had asked the lady to show him back at the main door in the buildings hall. He had felt a rush of blood to the head while walking on the street in Newfoundland. Alike to Les Misèrables it may seem this was prolly the first time he had succeeded to establish a correspondence. Even if he did call a Raincheck funnier that time.
  The Invasion Of The Lunatic Pandora had led folk of men to stray back then. It really was hysterical. If You ask me Laguna thought to himself.

DG: Conclusion

  The Staircase back at home was marmory stone and he preferred to climb the stairs rather than use an elevator. He had been living in this single apartment the past five Years time. There was something wrong. Could it be that he was poisoned?
  Headache would tease the back of his cryon. Needing putrid water he fixed a bank of liquid in a casserole pot he had owned ever since he could remember. No omega-3 producing.
  It helped him only asfar as to lay in bed suffering for hours in the dark of the night. A pain killer resolved the ameba bringing him sleep at last.
  Laguna slept away his headache and when the morning came he didn't bother getting up, because it was saturday but greeted Ellone a Good Morning. After an hour or so he once again put up some effort in the kitchen this time fixing himself a baguette and taking the rest of the marmalade from the refridgerator. The Girl would eat a little bit ham with her bread. It was a delightful weather outside and for a little while they looked out of the window while enjoying chai tea as a posteriori.
  The moral about putridiousness was that the correspondent had gone trough a change in his blood image. It had felt like if his blood type had changed from a common blood giver to the type O negative. That's what had made him human.
  Don't worry about poisoning and just keep clean putting up clock vice. There was nothing the Duchuene might not do in order to survive. Soldiering up was alright. It was for the best. Belladonna was clandestine...
  The Veteran wasn't a type who might throw up. He did consider it the worst scenario for real if you suffered of a retard in the food circle. The blow had deminished to a microscopic. Ellone would take care of him always when he was feeling ill.
  Today he wanted to do a little bit of research, because something in the back of his mind associated with the subject of his article. He jumped into the brown trousers. Visiting the town might help him to manage about his intellectual target. Afterwards he was going to cook another water bank fixing a full measure of ramen for the both of them.
  Laguna was feeling pretty inspired. There was a medieval sense to what he was percieving, because he liked to listen to music and Valse di Fantastica had been his favourite tune trough the blood transmutation. He had bought a walkman from a music store with his daughter the Day they had moved in their working relation apartment. He kept his nose up while he exit the building and the fresh air hovered upon to his face. The richness of the scent belonged to the season. Here you could almost taste the sea.

  To all of You who may wanna read about the okies it's my pleasure. I am the brief exchanger at the Duchuesney of Dollet and I'm hoping to be able to gather up more and update You about the life situation in here. The world is a funny place so in my opinion it's for the best to let The World hear about how the drum dowes.
  Even though it seems that the situations never change still there might be further opportunity to get intouch with the other as Epicnaras has lasaid.

US: Duchuesney of Dollet After Lunatic Pandora

  The Second Generation Post Lunatic Pandora has lost the war so it seems, just because so they say. Ofcourse there's plenty of information about the actual state of affaire, but it's been scattered all around. You would have the permission to touch the subject only after applying to a profile school such where the personel happened to hold the materials safe.
  There was a contradiction about which generation was the actual second one living after the Invasion of The Lunatic Pandora as a matter of a fact, because the age scale differed about who had what sort of a position during the war time. If a person was held back then as corresponding to a military job then he probably was married already twenty Years old and had atleast one son if not two or a daughter aswell. The offspring of the first wave soldiers weren't the actual second generation living after the invasion, because they were the first wave of war evacuatees who got married and had children after the peace was officially announced. The Invasion had put an End to the classical feodal farming village community culture. Enter the second generation Post Invasion Of The Lunatic Pandora not just One but Two generations after the first wave of the evacuatees.

New to the community, great to be here. Diagnosed last summer by HealthHero then decided to try and 'think' my way out of ADHD due to a fear about what the meds might do for about six months.

Bit the bullet recently and paid through the nose to get the medication from HH. They started me on EQUASYM 20MG which worked for a day or two and helped silence a lot of the mess in my head. After a few days it didn't seem to work as well though and I seemed to slip off into usually spiralled thinking, executive dysfunction and emotional disregulation getting in the way of productivity.

I was moved up to 30MG after a week which was great for about a fortnight. Then after my first medication review, the psychiatrist (Who I could barely hear to the horrendous quality of HH Zoom calls), put me up to 40MG. 

The last few days have been bizarre. I get a rush of euphoria about 15 minutes after I take it and then get an insatiable restlessness that I feel determined to 'chase' with coffee/caffeine etc. Even without coffee, I am extremely restless, giddy and jittery for the day. I get short bursts of intense hyper focussing but then I am gone again.

I now discovered that the 40MG is Ritalin LA rather than EQUASYM. Wondering is that why I am noticing such a massive difference in my response rather than the dosage?

I'm a 34M btw. Any thoughts or feedback would be great. Still on the waiting list for UMAAP but it's so encouraging reading other posts in here. I can't believe I managed without a diagnosis for most of my life. But then again, I didn't.",1,1740495174.0,ADHDIreland,4,1.0,False

We have some kids, I did the majority of school runs and spoke to a few of the mums, after word spread one of these mum's got my number from another and reached out. Just to see how I was. We text almost everyday since then, been out for coffee or drinks and cinema once. I was open and said I was just looking for friendship but maybe that'll change, she said the exact same thing.  
  
I never really mourned my marriage, it felt dead for a long time but I was struggling not seeing my kids as much and just being completely alone. This mum has just gotten out of a very toxic relationship and we really had a lot in common. I'd be lying if I said she wasn't attractive and that I felt a bit of a spark. She'd send me selfies, sometimes in bed if we'd been out to show me she was home.  
  
We went out the Monday before last to the cinema, we laughed and had a good time. As we were walking back to her car she gave me a smile I hadn't seen in a long time. I composed myself and we parted ways. She text me she was home, sent a pic and we text for about an hour then she went quite. I figured she'd fallen asleep. Then I get a text, her ex for no reason just sent her a barrage of abuse at 11 at night.  
  
I'm guessing it went on for days as she fully backed away from me, she just kept calling herself a horrible person and she didn't deserve to be happy. Then she just stopped. I've barely heard from her. I got whiplash from the change in motion. I feel for her, I know she's not a bad person but I can't do anything. I've spent the last week beating myself up, I cried more about this then I did my marriage falling apart.   
  
I don't know why but I just feel like such a loser for even thinking something good could happen. I hate my new life. I miss my kids. I miss her, just as a friend. I know the right thing to do is just forget it. Move on but I'm in such a shitty place in life I guess I was just chasing that high.   
  
Do I give her space? Will she think I've just abandoned her? I dunno, I'm so out of the game, even the friendship game I'm just so beaten down by it. Fuck that guy.",6,1740495071.0,GuyCry,4,0.88,False

You know what they say. ""Teach a man to fish? And a Salamander left alone at the forge will go off the deep end reading articles on the Focus Together website regarding potential Apothecary Concepts only to dust off his decade old design (terrible ones) design skills and try his hand it it.""

That is what they say right? I'm sure it is. I'm going to go with it. They say it somewhere.

Also, shocking lack of Salamander Apothecary art. Great Techmarine and Librarian art, no Apothecary. 

Anyway, onto what my pre-coffee awake mind came up with by looking over the current perks, current existing game mechanics, looking over other existing Warhammer 40k Games, looking over what the Swarm Game Engine is capable of, and looking over the old  Fantasy Flight Deathwatch TTRPG.

This is what my deranged mine came up with, let me know how much you hate it!

**Apothecary Design Theory:** The design theory behind this Apothecary is based around the *Contested Health* mechanic, the goal was developed a *Buff, Boost, Debuff* class that both was and wasn’t a healer as not to step on the healing abilities of the Vanguard and Bulwark or the *Contested Health* regeneration buff of the Tactical Marine. 

Thus, my take on the Apothecary applies *Contested Health,* rather than regenerating it, in most cases. This applied *Contested Health* is the core of most of the abilities and how this class “heals.” It enables other classes to heal themselves. 

Combat Wise, the Apothecary is a Mid-to-Close range fighter. Many of the abilities have 10-meter ranges, this means it’s best between the ranged and the melee. Many of its abilities are also depending on repeating the same action or getting into melee and performing chains. This supports the choice of ranged weapons, Carbines. Given that the class interacts so much with *Contested Health,* high RoF, low damage weapons were an easy choice. The same can be said for the side arm choices, high impact, slow RoF.

[Ooh Fancy!](https://preview.redd.it/0wc8aha1qale1.png?width=1358&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d3a659b531a856e6bbb910fb624112031055705)

**Basics:**



**Primary Weapon:** *Bolt Carbine, Oculus Bolt Carbine, or Instigator Bolt Carbine*



**Secondary Weapon:** *Plasma Pistol, Heavy Bolt Pistol, Reductor Pistol*



**Melee Weapon:** *Narthecium*



**Starting Perk:** *Advanced Medicae Systems:* The Apothecary does not loose Contested Health over time, only on incoming damage.



**Class Ability:** *Not Even In Death Does Duty End:* The Apothecary begins to emit an aura that restores 15% Contested health to all Battle Brothers within 15 meters every 2 seconds, during this time the Apothecary cannot run or dash.



**Perk Tree:** 



**Core Perks:** Core perks are easily organized into Buff, Boost, and Debuff. Buff Perks other than first are mostly passive. They require you to be in proximity to someone. Boost and Debuff perks rely on the Narthacium and the melee attack.



***Chapter’s Due(Buff)Lvl.2:*** When reviving an Incapacitated Ally, you and the Ally gain 20% contested health. In addition, you regain an additional 15% Contested Health from your sidearm.



***Field Triage(Boost)Lvl.3*****:** Using your Narthecium on an ally applies 5% contested health and reduces incoming ranged damage by 3% up to a maximum of 30% for 10 seconds. Allies at full health immediately loose the benefits of this effect.



***Vengeance for the Fallen(Debuff)Lvl.4:*** Striking up to 3 enemy targets within 5 meters of a fallen ally with your side arm applies a debuff to increasing damage done to said targets by 10% for 5 seconds. Cooldown is 15 seconds. 



***Genetic Purity(Buff)Lvl.10:*** When standing within 10 meters of an ally they benefit from the Apothecaries Advanced Medicae Systems. In addition, The Apothecaries Gun Strikes apply 3% Melee Damage Reduction, up to a maximum of 30% for 10 seconds to allies that remain within 10 meters as well as themselves.



***Relentless Pursuit(Boost)Lvl.11:*** When using a dash attack from your Narthacium on an ally, the ally gains a 5 second speed boost of 20% and you and the targeted ally is immune to knock back from heavy attacks for the duration. This effect has a 90 second cooldown. 



***Caduceus Rex(Debuff)Lvl.12:*** When using a charge attack with your Narthacium on an enemy, you perform a second conical AoE attack that deals minimal damage, targets affected by this attack (excluding Terminus) are stunned for 8 seconds and you regain 10% Contested health for each Majoris or Extremis target effected. Cooldown is 60 seconds.



***Emperor’s Mercy(Buff)Lvl.18:*** When standing within 10 meters of an ally with a mortal wound, you and the ally both deal an additional 10% ranged damage and suffer 10% less ranged damage. In addition, both you and the ally regain 10% extra contested health from your side arms.



***Unyielding Flesh(Boost)Lvl.19:*** When using a charge attack with your Narthacium on an ally, you apply a buff that reduces all inbound damage by 5% to a maximum of 25%, this buff lasts 3 seconds unless reapplied. Once lost an ally cannot benefit from the buff again for 120 Seconds. In addition, you reduce all incoming damage to your contested health by 15%

  
**Team Perks:** Team perks of the Apothecary had to avoid two things. Direct Healing (Vanguard, Bulwark) and boosting Contested Health Regen (Tactical). Instead, the three team perks of the Apothecary play off Contested Health or Health Value for various effects.



***Monitored Bio-signs(Buff)Lvl.5:*** When a Battle Brother falls in battle, the Apothecary can remotely manage their bio-signs via their Armor. The time until they expire is doubled. In addition, when a Battle Brother possesses Contested Health, they fight harder and with greater vigor. Increasing their damage output by 10%.



***Regenerative Rage(Boost)Lvl.13:*** When a Battle Brother regains more than 20% of their hit points in a single attack, they gain an additional 20% damage to all attacks and are immune to knockback from all sources for the next 8 seconds. This effect can not occur more than once every 60 seconds. 



***Last Stand(Boost/Buff)Lvl.21:*** When a Battle Brother would fall before gaining their first Mortal Wound, they instead choose to fight on for an additional 4 seconds with increased vigor becoming immune to all damage and knock back while increasing their damage by 15%. This effect only applies to Battle Brothers who do not currently possess a Mortal Wound.



**Gear Perks:** Gear perks are divided into Chems, Narthacium, and Weapons. These don’t exactly follow the same Buff, Boost, Debuff structure. Rather it would more accurate to say they follow an Offensive, Buff, Utility Structure.



***Intelligent Dissection(Offensive)Lvl.6:*** You deal 5% more damage to Majoris or Extremis enemies of the same type that you have executed in the last 10 seconds. This stacks up to 5 times and lasts 10 seconds. Once the buff has expired, you may not benefit from it again for 90 seconds. 



***Xenotoxins(Offensive)Lvl.7:*** You deal 100% more equipment damage to Minioris enemies and take 15% less contested health damage from Minoris enemies. In addition, Killing 10 enemies of any type in rapid succession will restore one equipment charge.



***Enhanced Carnifex(Offensive)Lvl.8:*** When you perform a Perfect Parry, you immediately send the target into execute range, gain 50% contested health, and perform an execute. (Majoris or Extremis only.) This effect cannot occur more than once every 180 seconds.



***Fortification(Buff)Lvl.14:*** When applying Contested Health to an ally, you also apply one unit of Armor if they have none. You continue to apply one unit of armor if they continue to have no armor, you may not apply more than one armor. In addition, when you regain armor by any means, you also gain 15% contested health per armor unit.



***Combat Chiurgion(Buff)Lvl.15:*** Whenever you perform an execute, all allies within 10 meters gain 10% of your current Contested health, minimum 10% Contested health. In addition, Medicae Stims used by yourself and allies within 10m are always used at full effectiveness.



***Helix Adept(Buff)Lvl.16:*** You and all allies within 10 meters generate an additional 20% contested health, in addition, you reduce the amount of damage you suffer to your contested health by 15%. If you have no contested health, you regain an equipment charge. This effect cannot occur more than once every 180 seconds.



***Transhuman Supremacy(Utility)Lvl.22:*** Your Narthacium parry window and your dodge window increases by 30%, gun strikes made after performing a perfect parry or perfect dodge immediately apply 20% Contested health to yourself and all allies within 10 meters. This effect has a cooldown of 90 seconds.



***Engage Magnificat Gland(Utility)Lvl.23:*** When below 20% health, you reduce all incoming damage by 20% for 10 Seconds and generate 15% Contested health every 2 seconds. During this time your Perfect Dodge and Perfect Parry windows are increased 100% and any negative status effects are removed. This effect cannot occur more than once every 180 seconds.



***Apothecary Primus(Utility)Lvl.24:*** Your primary weapons now return as much contested health as your side arms, in addition, gun strikes with your side arm restores one clip of ammunition for your primary weapon provided you have contested health and head shots with your primary weapon restore one clip of ammunition to your side arm provided you have contested health, this effect cannot occur more than once every 180 seconds.



**Signature Perks:** The Apothecary Signature Abilities were a bit of a challenge. Once again, because I had avoid overlap, I choose to follow the three tap method I had in the start. We have a Buff, a Boost, and a Debuff. 



***Collect Combat Samples(Buff)Lvl.9:*** You generate 10% Contested health with each execution of a Majoris and 20% contested health with the execution of a Extremis or Terminus enemy.  Minoris enemies cannot reduce your contested health below 10%



***Recover Gene-Seed(Boost)Lvl.18:*** Provided your class ability is fully charged, you may revive a fallen ally without a Mortal Wound, but at only 5% health, but 95% Contested Health. This consumes the entire charge of your class ability. Allies may only benefit from Recover Geneseed twice per Operation.



***Rebuke the Alien, Heretic, Mutant(Debuff)Lvl.25:***  While using the Class Ability, The Apothecary reduces the Damage output of all Majoris and Extremis enemies in the effected area by 20% and Minioris are instantly slain.

  
**Weapon Logic:** 

The Apothecary would have access to two unique weapons that would supplement the Buff/Boost/Debuff playstyle. The Narthecium and the Reductor pistol. I came up with this concept as a long time player of the Tabletop going way back, remembering when Apothecaries had access to a large range of wargear. That and given that this design works a great deal with contested health, high RoF weapons like the carbines are excellent options.



As for the Narthecium, its perk Tree would have two primary paths. A Path to boost the application of Buffs and Debuffs as well as a path to boost the application of Contested Health and Damage. Use wise, the Narthceium would be a faster, weaker version of the Power Fist. It however would be faster and lack the AoE abilities, but given the existence of the “Carnifex” (Not the Tyranid), I imagine it would have some build in penetration.



As for the Reductor Pistol, Its perk tree would be built around applying debuffs at range or alternately, gun strike effects to take advantage of the class in melee. Use wise, the Reductor Pistol would be both a step up and step down from the Heavy Bolt Pistol, I imagine a significantly smaller magazine, between 2 to 4 bullets, shorter range, lower RoF, but significantly higher stopping power.

However the ‘average speed over a known distance’ function of the outer ring is so niche and visually clunky. I understand it is an ode to racing heritage ties of horology, and there is a place for that in those specific “racing style” watches. Speedmaster, Daytona, etc. 

I would argue that most people wearing a watch have a heartbeat… most. And that a pulsometer ring is a much more relatable function, and is more symmetrical therefore more beautiful. 

Most people, myself included, likely use a chronograph to time boring every day happenings. How long does it take me to pee? How long is this person going to talk for? How long does it take to make coffee? This function is still available if the tachymeter ring is replace with a pulsometer.

New machine is throwing me off.,"Up until yesterday I had been using a used Sage Bambino Plus to make espresso at home. It made tasty milk drinks, but I could never pull a shot that tasted good on its own. I can only describe the flavour of most shots as 'harsh', and I just chalked it up to my taste buds being different. I decided I wanted more control over the process so I made what I thought was a lateral move to the Turin Legato/MiiCoffee Apex (it's available on Amazon now for anyone interested in the UK). I set the OPV to 9 bar and kept my temp at 95 for a medium roast I'm using. I've pulled several unoptimised shots up till now and everything is tasting noticeably better and I don't really understand why. All the reviews of the Bambino seem quite positive, but I'm wondering now if the machine I had was pulling at like 15 bar and some stupid temperature. I realise I have a tonne of bias in myself just trying to justify the purchase, but the difference seems too great for that.

When you read ""harvesting"" most of you thought it was our organs right? Well, here is the crazy part. It is NOT our organs or flesh that the aliens are interested in. It is our ""excrement""!

There have been many reports by abductees that their alien abductors smelt literally like $h!t. That is because they consume human excrement - which is probably a very sought after commodity. 

Most people after they do their business in the restroom,, just flush and walk out, never thinking about where their ""deposit"" goes. One thing that the government does well is to maintain the sewage system and getting completely rid of our waste. Now, why do you think that is? One thing is for sure. It is not out of the kindness of their heart. People freeze to death sleeping on the streets and homeless people go hungry and absolutely no mercy from the government. But the sewage system is always maintained reasonably well despite all the cutbacks in other services. The humans at the top have struck a deal with the aliens to exchange human excrement for whatever it is they get. The fact that our excrement is so toxic to us - as a result of the genetic engineering - ensures that we never question where the ""stuff"" goes after we flush. This is the perfect setup. Imagine diamond mine workers who would dutifully mine the diamonds, but would never ever  think of stealing any...because the diamonds were toxic to them.

Also it's not that the idea is that outlandish. In Indonesia and Bali you will very often have the opportunity to taste a “Kopi Luwak” (“civet coffee”). This coffee prepared from coffee beans that are ingested by the civet and which, after their passage through the animal’s digestive system, are expelled in their excrement and then collected and enjoyed by humans!

I’ve been using this semi-automatic espresso machine for a few weeks, and while it has redefined my mornings, it’s not without its quirks.

**Coffee Quality**

Each shot I pulled with this machine was consistently rich and full-bodied, with a layer of crema that could rival many professional coffee shops. I experimented with different coffee beans—light, medium, and dark roasts—and I loved the flexibility the Barista Express offered in achieving the perfect flavor profile. The integrated conical burr grinder plays a significant role here, ensuring freshly ground coffee for every cup. Having control over the grind size and dose gave me the freedom to tweak my espresso just the way I like it.

**Brewing Performance**

The machine’s brewing capability is impressive for its price range. The low-pressure pre-infusion feature caught my attention as it helps to extract coffee evenly. The built-in PID temperature control ensures that water is consistently delivered at the optimal temperature. I noticed the espresso shots were smooth, balanced, and flavorful every time.

[Click here to find Breville Barista Express Espresso Machine on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b00ch9qwou/)

**Milk Frothing & Steaming Capability**

The steam wand is powerful yet approachable for beginners. It creates microfoam milk that’s perfect for lattes and cappuccinos, though I must admit my attempts at latte art ended up looking more like abstract blobs. Still, the texture and flavor of the milk were spot on. My niece, who’s an aspiring barista, had a blast practicing her frothing skills.

**Design & Build Quality**

I can't get enough of the brushed stainless steel finish. It’s sleek, modern, and adds a touch of sophistication to my kitchen counter. The machine feels sturdy and well-made, which is reassuring given its weight of over 22 pounds. The built-in tamper and pressure gauge are practical and streamlined, making the design both functional and attractive.

**Water Tank & Capacity**

The 67-ounce water tank is more than sufficient for my needs. I found the hinged lid and built-in water filter extremely user-friendly. However, those who drink espresso more than twice daily might find themselves refilling the tank frequently. My cousin, who’s a heavy coffee drinker, did mention that her machine needed topping up often during family gatherings.

**Maintenance & Cleaning**

Cleaning this machine turned out to be easier than I anticipated. The drip tray and water reservoir are both removable, and the cleaning cycle alerts are a nice touch. The included cleaning tools are handy, and the instructions were straightforward. However, the grinder does require regular cleaning to maintain optimal performance, especially when switching between oily and non-oily beans.

**Energy Efficiency & Noise Levels**

The noise level when grinding coffee beans isn’t whisper-quiet, but it’s not obnoxiously loud either. The energy efficiency is decent for a machine in this category, and the auto-off feature is a welcome addition for someone like me, who often forgets to turn off kitchen appliances.

**Warranty & Support**

Breville’s one-year limited product warranty offers peace of mind, though I haven’t had to use it yet. I did test their customer service line with some hypothetical questions, and they were prompt and helpful.

**Competing Products**

I compared this espresso machine with the De'Longhi Dedica and Gaggia Classic Pro. While the Breville Barista Express stands out for its built-in grinder and overall user-friendly interface, the Gaggia Classic Pro might appeal to purists seeking more manual control. The De'Longhi Dedica, on the other hand, is more compact and affordable but lacks the robust features of the Breville.

**Key Benefits**

* Built-in grinder for freshly ground coffee.
* Consistent brewing performance with temperature control.
* Sleek, durable stainless steel design.
* User-friendly steam wand for microfoam milk.
* Easy maintenance with cleaning reminders.

**Areas for Improvement**

* Grinder requires frequent cleaning for optimal performance.
* Water tank might feel small for heavy users.
* Noise level during grinding could be quieter.

**True Value**

Given its features and performance, I believe this espresso machine offers excellent value for money. It’s an investment that pays off in the long run, especially if you’re someone who frequents coffee shops. The ability to control every aspect of your espresso-making process makes it a standout choice for both beginners and enthusiasts.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

We grew closer and wanted to get married. Since we don’t live in the same state, I think a part of me was afraid things wouldn’t work out and I let that push me into a poor decision. 

Someone I had gone to school with reached out and wanted to meet for coffee and I went, even though C and I had established exclusivity. Deep down I did not even want to go out with him and saw no potential. I was weak and regretted it instantly, especially since he tried to be extremely inappropriate with me. I thought that C did not deserve someone who would betray their trust like that and I removed all men from my socials and anything that could lead me to be in a situation like that again. I had even distanced myself from C because of the guilt. 

But we found our way back to eachother and have gotten closer again and want to get engaged and do things the right way. 

However, I can’t take the guilt I feel. I know if I tell C he would most likely never be able to trust me again. I’ve sincerely repented and still do, but I feel like the most evil person in the world. Do I owe him the truth as a form of accountability, or would that just cause unnecessary pain? I feel very lost and regretful, any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you",5,1740493773.0,islam,13,0.78,False

I am moving to NOLA for a 18 month work contract. My offices are in the warehouse district but I don’t mind an up to 30 minute drive to get to work. I live in Los Angeles so traffic does not scare me.

Some top things I am looking for:

Green spaces and parks near by *I am a nature nerd and my doggo needs green parks daily just like me

Cool coffee shops and restaurants in the area and I wouldn’t be mad at a Trader Joe’s or Whole Foods but happy to drive to grocery  

Safe, but yes I get that nowhere is safe in a big city, I live in east Los Angeles so I have thicker skin here

A more house type rental, I like warm and cozy over stiff apartment complex vibes. Only need one bedroom smaller unit, I currently live in a duplex so that vibe is nice. A small yard for the doggo would be a bonus.

Being near an amazing green dog park would be a bonus. 

Free street parking would be a bonus.

I don’t need to be near any fun action or party zones, I am sober and it’s not my vibe. I more like relaxed spaces and good food. 

Budget, would like to stay in the $1600 - max $2000 zone 

I will be renting a place for a month temp while I find the perfect spot. Given the above info where should I look? 

Seems like maybe lower garden district but would love to hear and other suggestions.

Then comes the enjoyable part.  I received a notification the next day that said, ""$40 has been charged to your account.""  I have no idea why.  I discovered that I had ""subscribed"" when I checked the website.  It's funny because I never registered for anything.

Unfortunately, Canada has been falling behind the U.S. for quite a while now, and, truth hits everybody eventually. I don’t know how long it will take for others, so I’m writing this post in the hope I can accelerate the awareness. Because it sure seems like most Canadians are terribly oblivious to the truth. But I’m being quite vague. What do I mean by ‘the truth’?

Canada is, well, the word I’ve been thinking about all day is, cringe. I know it’s a very inexact term, but I can’t get it out of my head. Why do I find Canada cringe right now? Because while Californians and Floridians go on with their lives, all of Canada has obsessively been talking about a Hockey game. If you don’t know, there’s this tournament called the 4 Nations Face-Off, which includes Canada, the U.S., and Finland and Sweden. The tournament's final game was against the United States, and in overtime, Canada squeaked out a victory 3-2. The Canadian side of my family is all obsessed with the game. None of them had ever been Hockey fans, but they felt compelled to watch it eagerly and text maple leaves and exclamation marks and “So happy for Canada! Redemption!” texts, and then there’s whatever manufactured in a lab jingoism this [Instagram post from Trudeau](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGUmGzcsjya/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) was.

So yes, I find that when the lamest of duck leaders tries to salvage some kind of popularity by employing a very forced form of patriotism, saying unironically,[ “You can’t take our country — and you can’t take our game,”](https://x.com/JustinTrudeau/status/1892793839649272278?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1892793839649272278%7Ctwgr%5Ef7ed93c3d55d88edb2b76d6a88016cfaca38a39d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sportsnet.ca%2Fnhl%2Farticle%2Fteam-canada-delivers-win-for-their-country-thats-the-canadian-way%2F) I cringe. When I walk into a coffee shop and the barista asks me if I watched *the* game, and two old women proudly declare: “Oh yeah, that showed the Americans they can’t bully us!” And the barista replies: “Oh did you hear how that little girl changed the national anthem? (she sang ""that only us command"" instead of ""in all of us command"") What a smart girl she is!”. Yes, I cringe.

The in-your-face comparative mediocrity of Canada is politely swept aside in exchange for a hollow, ‘symbolic’ hockey game victory. You might think I’m just doing my best Freddie DeBoer impression, trying to rain on people’s parades. But like Freddie, I have good reason! I love celebration, but not when the thing being celebrated is some competitive event that didn’t even register internationally, let alone in most of the rival country. And more importantly, it’s completely disconnected from Canada’s obvious problems, which are, to put it most generally, that it lacks economic and cultural dynamism. Brilliant people like Canadian-Israeli computer scientist [Ilya Sutskever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever), a co-founder of OpenAI, don’t stay up north, they work in Silicon Valley.

In my late 20s, touching 30, I could go the gym 4 times a week even and feel tired but great. 3 times was pretty much a norm. Now? Twice if I'm lucky. 3 times means, I'm spending my weekend lying on the couch.

And work? I swear works making me feel like a dumb moron after office hours. It's like 6-7pm and my brain just switches off.

My diet is better than before, I eat healthier food now. I occasionally drink and that too maybe 2-3 beers and I'm done. I have coffee at most twice a day and sleep about 8 hours everyday.

Like does age really take such a steep toll on the body post mid 30s? Am I having a hard time accepting this?",21,1740493129.0,NoStupidQuestions,77,0.87,False
1ixw1fg,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingStory/comments/1ixw1fg/its_been_15_years/,Its been 15 years,"I have been thinking alot about him lately so I figured I'd just write our story down. Maybe it will satisfy that itch my brain has about him right now.

This was how we met.

It was a chilled summer evening. A friend and I were driving up and down the main road in our little city. Waving at or pulling over to hang out with friends we saw. It was a very normal evening. We had just gotten done smoking with a friend and wanted to go grab a bite to eat so we loaded back into her suv and hit the main drag. 

We were at a stop light when his truck rolled up beside us. He had dark tinted windows that were down about half way to let the smell of Black and Mild drift over us. I could see just his eyes in the opening of the window. There was this twinkle, or glint, or just something hard to describe, that made me get flush. The light turned green and I told my friend that I wanted to be by that truck at the next light. I was going to talk to him. He clearly felt the same way because by the time we got next to his truck the window was all the way down and he was smiling at me. He was so beautiful I couldn't talk. His face was rather defined, full lips, beautiful greenish eyes. I scrolled my number down on a piece of paper and handed it to him then the light turned green and he turned off. I was hoping he'd call or text right then but of course he didn't. It took him a painstaking 30 minutes to finally call.

""Hey, I'm M.""

I was instantly hooked. His voice was, golden. It dripped from the phone and into my ear like intoxicating honey. It sent every cell in my body into overdrive. I was flush and fluttery and could barely respond.

""I'm L""

Come on girl all you could get out is formalities?!?!?! I felt so stupid. I should have asked a question or started a conversation. I'm usually so good at talking to people why am I freezing up now?

""Do you want to come to this party I'm at?"" He said.

""I can't tonight. We have plans actually, but if you're free tomorrow...""

""Sure.""

My friend had to go so she dropped me off at my apartment. I didn't actually have plans but I did not want to go by myself. I kept feeling like I should have just gone. My neighbor J noticed I was home and she came knocking at my door a while later. She lived with her mom in a small apartment so she was at my apartment all the time.

I let her in and she asked me how I felt about drugs. I told her I'm not really into the hard stuff. She asked if it was ok if her dealer came by my house as her mom was sleeping at their apartment. Sure, why not. I could use a distraction. It's night time now, about 9pm I'd guess. There's a knock on my apartment door and J opens the door. 2 guys walk into my home, she walks them to the couch where I'm sitting and watching a movie. I look up to see M in my house.

I'm sure I looked dumb founded because J then asks, ""Do you two know eachother?"" A smirk slides across his face. ""I'll take that as a yes."" 

His friend and J go into the other room to do their transaction. Meanwhile he sits down on the floor across from me. That glint is there again in his eyes. I am blushing entirely too much. He's across the coffee table and lower than me. Something about it feels so invigorating.

""So this was your ""plans"" then? Go home and buy drugs instead of go to a party with me? Geeze girl, you've got your priorities all lined out huh?"" His tone overly sarcastic.

""Well, if I went to said party, you would have left me there to come here anyways. I just cut out some of the formalities of getting you back to my house."" I say with sickening sarcasm and a wink. 

We are both giggling like little kids at this point. His friend comes back to the living room and they leave. J asks me about it and I tell her everything. Then she proceeds to tell me about M. She's known M for multiple years.

Days go by and I don't hear from M. I don't reach out as I'm about positive that he's not into me, I'm probably not his type (I think I'm pretty but as my guy friend put it, some guys might like me but most won't) I probably came off pretty weird. Maybe he wasn't giggling with me but laughing at me. As you can see i was very insecure then.

One day I walk into small town grocery store to grab an Arizona tea while on a walk. I was chatting to the produce manager and went to turn and leave when I run directly into M. 

""I know you."" He says. 

Again I am going flush. And again he invites me to a party later in the day. This time I say ok. He asks for my number again as he has gotten a new phone. 

We linked up and started hanging out pretty frequently. We were so synced. I'd pick up the phone to call him and my phone would ring because he was calling me. I'd go clothes shopping and run into him. We started dating. My friends adored him. I adored him.

He was everything perfect. I loved him.

Ultimately he broke it off with me. I was devastated. He told me we should have been friends first, and that he didn't want to cheat on me anymore. That I was too nice of a person to do that to. 

The craziest part about it was I knew he liked to sleep around. When we first started talking he told me he was married. He had gotten a divorce and resized his wedding band to fit on his middle finger on the right hand. I knew he'd slept around on me, it wasn't a big secret. Eveyone knew. I knew. I told him it was fine to find others to sleep with. I didnt feel like it was cheating as everything else was good and I'd be happy to share. He couldn't. 

It hit me hard. I was so sucker punched. I had fallen so hard for M. I would take any opportunity to go with friends and see M. I was crazy about him. I still am.

Eventually M left to FL to take care of his grandma. He and I started talking again and he wanted me to come down to see him. I couldn't. I knew if I did it would be a bigger heart break than before. I eventually wrote him a letter explaining how I felt and the things I found out. I had to stop with him. And he stopped with me. His ex was pregnant, and I couldn't breath when thinking about him.

I still get shakey and flush when I think about him and it's been 15 years. I wonder if he thinks about me. I wonder if our lives are going to cross again. I wonder if his friends give him updates on me. I wonder if I meant anything to him.

We're both married and have our own families but I just can't help but wonder what my life would be like if I was able to hold onto M.",1,1740493126.0,DatingStory,0,0.67,False
1ixw18q,https://i.redd.it/62bij35mnale1.jpeg,Aiden ratios at bigger batch sizes,"I’ve been a bit confused by the coffee calculator in the Aiden and hoping someone can help me. 

For a profile with a 16:5 ratio, I asked Auden to make a series of batch sizes. Here’s a tracker of:

* water (ml) - the batch sizes I asked Aiden to brew
* coffee (g) - the amount of ground coffee Aiden asked for (with a 16.5 ratio profile)
* true ratio - water/coffee to calculate the true ratio, to 3dp
* g @ 16.5:1 - water/16.5 to calculate the required coffee to maintain 16:5


What confuses me is that the ratio is lost after 1350ml brew volume. Anyone know why this is?

I’ve been brewing between 1-1.2 L and getting great results. I want to start brewing bigger (1.4-1.5L) batches but I don’t want to waste a tonne of coffee and time trying to brew something that’s destined to fail. 

Anyone have any experience in scaling up from 1L to 1.5L?",3,1740493111.0,FellowProducts,1,0.71,False
1ixw11d,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1ixw11d/positive_long_distance_poly_relationship_stories/,Positive long distance poly relationship stories please,"I am married and in a long distance D/s dynamic for the last 18 months. I have had other poly relationships that lasted 8-12 months each and husband has had a few shorter relationships/connections. It has actually been difficult for him to find someone to gel with for a relationship but he has met someone recently and, although it is in the early stages, I am very hopeful it will work out because they seem to really work well together. 

My long distance relationship has hit a bit of a rocky patch - it isn't rocky really, just my partner has stuff going on that has prevented us from seeing each other as often as we would like - but we are still in contact and communicating well, committed to the relationship/dynamic etc. It has just been a bit difficult but all relationships have ups and downs. We are both established where we live, we have families and are 4 hours apart so there is no plan to ever move closer to each other. We have discussed things like collaring and our commitment to each other, but never specifically the longevity of the relationship - which I am fine with. I sort of want to hear success stories on people who have made this type of LDR work and what things have helped.

I think I just need positivity as my husband is in the midst of NRE with this new connection and I am 100% happy for him, and I am dealing with the low of not seeing my partner and feeling a bit sad that I can't just go out for dinner some evening with him or grab a coffee over the weekend if we are both busy.  

I am also aware that this is the first time really that my husband may have another relationship that isn't more of a FWB-type arrangement and I have had to gently remind him that our own relationship can't be forgotten in this NRE. I know we will sort that - it is just on top of not seeing my other partner it is making me feel extra left out of quality time with everyone....hence the need for positivity please!

I'm about to order my first bit of kit for a home setup. I'm not a stranger to espresso. I own a small company that has always had an espresso setup for the staff, starting with a Quickmill Andreja and a Vario, and we now have a 2 head Nuova Simonelli Auerelia II and a Malhkonig K30. Most of our staff now work from home, but it's a treat for those of us that do come into the office. However, at home I've just been enjoying good beans in a french press because up until a few years ago, my wife didn't even drink coffee (I don't know why we've been together so long either).

Anyway, we're doing a kitchen reno atm, and I'm going to pull the trigger on a nice mid range espresso machine and grinder. I want something my family can learn to use without needing to be handheld the whole time. I've done the E61 thing and I like it, but I've been really impressed with what I've seen in the Profitec Move. I do want a dual boiler, and it looks like it would be a good choice for everyone in the house, once I get it dialled in. I'd consider the Go if it had a water tap, but Americanos will be desired and I don't want to set up the kettle each time we make one. I do have some concerns about buying gen 1 of a new machine that relies on a lot of tech, but I think it will suit our needs quite nicely if it lives up to the hype. I was also looking at the Pro 600, the ECM Mechanika and a few others.

I'm planning to pair that with a Mazzer Philos. I like the single dose format, and it appears to be a real workhorse and I think it's quite striking too. I've watched so many grinder reviews, and I think this will suit our needs handily, although I do wish it was a bit smaller. I was also considering the Vario VS6, and the Ceado E6P, but the Philos is on sale, and I think a little better built than both of those.

Thoughts?

I have had acid reflux for about 2-3 weeks, and i think its because i drink 3 coffee every day, because i am a healthy 20 year old who trains everyday. I took Omeprazole with 20mg (2 every day) and now i take 1 every day.
First night ( while sleeping) it happend i lost my breath for 30 seconds and then it happend again the same day while sleeping. And then 1,5 week later after it happend the first day, it happend again and i lost my breath for 30 seconds again. Im afraid to go back to playing football like i used to because im afraid i could get acid reflux while playing. I also only drink warm water now, nothing else.

According to the doctor my EKG was really good and also my blood.

My question is, does it get better, how long does it take for the acid to go away completely, and what did you do? 
Please help a worried 20 year old.
