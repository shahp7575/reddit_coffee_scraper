1g0jhy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/1g0jhy3/navy_federal_cashrewards_plus_card_new_10oct2024/,Navy Federal cashRewards Plus Card [New: 10OCT2024],"tl;dr: new version of cashRewards card called cashRewards Plus. Uncapped 2% cash back, no AF, no FTF, no min. reward redemption, SUB is $200 after $2,000 MSR (and a one-time $98 to Walmart+ if you're into it). NFCU membership required.

NFCU launched a new upgrade to the cashRewards card. In my humble opinion, it starts out in the same class as the Fidelity Visa due to the uncapped 2% cash back and no AF/FTF, but beats it (for my situation) because of the following:

  
1) No reward redemption minimums or restrictions

2) Easier to get higher limit with NFCU (50k limit on my cashRewards)

3) No balance transfer fee, and they occasionally run 0% promotions for existing cardholders which is music to my ears

4) Don't have to deal with Elan Financial- NFCU has 24/7 support and I have only had positive interactions every time I call.



In case you didn't know, you must be a Navy Federal Credit Union member to open this card. If you meet the eligibility requirements for membership, NFCU has a lot of perks.



This product seems to have just launched today, so I have not called in and tried to product change yet. If anyone cares enough to read this and wants me to report back with an update, I will happily do so after I finish my coffee and give them a jingle.",2,1728568855.0,CreditCards,0,1.0,False

Then switched to 1/half for a month and 10 days ago found strength to finally quit. Had a headache for a day and felt really tired ( given that i also quit sugar ). So I drank an equivalent of caffeine in black tea to get me through the day and napped a lot. But last three days I decided to not have even tea ( bc I frankly got tired of the taste ). I still feel fatigued throughout the day but I attribute that more to me lacking physical activity in my life and my general low energy levels to which i’m not used anymore bc of prolonged coffee usage not as a symptom of withdrawal. I would be glad to be wrong though and that it is a withdrawal symptom which will be elevated in a few weeks when I really will be caffeine free. ,2,1728568773.0,decaf,0,1.0,False
1g0jgiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TBI/comments/1g0jgiv/dreams_of_real_life_or_real_memories/,Dreams of real life or real memories,"I'm sure this is pretty common, but I couldn't find any previous posts on the subject, maybe there is a word for this? 

For years I've had short dreams of things happening in real life, after the most recent TBI it's getting a lot more intense. (History of micro hemorrhages for a while before the ""big one"" recently)

They can be as simple as putting the coffee on, getting dressed, putting an item in a different place, crossing something off my to do list, telling a friend a story 

They range but can get quite anxious, for example, screwing up important things, missing appointments, a partner cheating or a friend turning on me, I've had one about an old boss asking me if I smoked weed before work every day (I often got asked if I'm drunk or stoned at work b/c of the visible but not so obvious TBI damage)

I don't always remember them as soon as I wake up, more often not, so as I'm going about my day I'm remembering, doing or saying things that were in a dream. 

After my most recent TBI I'm having dreams about actual memories, or so I think; bigger life stuff, important conversations, weird dreams about those closest to me. I assume because I lost a good chunk of memories and my brain is trying to fill in the gaps.

It used to happen a couple times a month, and I would remember it was a dream, now it's almost every day. It's getting really hard to distinguish between what actually happened, what is a dream and what is multiple memories blending together in my head. My partner and friends have corrected me about things I'm SURE happened in my long term memories. I think not knowing is really starting to weigh on me, it's like a constant stress dream in my head asleep or awake, I talk myself down but it's resilient. Starting to make me feel pretty paranoid about things that I know will/would never happen, but what if they did? 

I've been clarifying a lot of my memories with my partner and friends, which has been helpful, but some things are so outlandish that I'm embarrassed to ask or worried it will hurt the person I'm telling. Those things are swirling around in my head and haunting me the last month or so. 

How the hell do I get past it?? Do I have to just face them all and ask? There must be a good coping technique for letting go of the things I remember that are too off to be true. The thoughts are so invasive..


Trying my best to stay positive and use healthy coping mechanisms,
Appreciate any advice or insight

1g0jetm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1g0jetm/increased_anxiety_on_vyvanse_from_getting_more/,Increased anxiety on Vyvanse from getting more sleep?,"Wondering if anyone can relate to this. I've been making a bunch of smaller changes in my life to better it. Including getting more sleep, timers on apps that eat a lot of my time like reddit/facebook/tiktok, meditation, taking ashwaganda, magnesium, vitamins b & d.

With the extra sleep I've been getting I've been feeling so much better in the morning. I kicked my caffeine habit at the end of July because I was horribly sick with some kind of viral infection for over a week. I didn't even feel the effects of withdrawal or notice for a couple weeks after I wasn't having coffee anymore.

I've also been having more of a chest/body feeling of anxiety that's just kinda... there in my chest and isn't that full body feeling of anxiety that I normally get. This morning I forgot to take my meds at my normal time and when they finally kicked in, I felt that anxiety in my chest. So im wondering if my Vyvanse is giving me more anxiety now that I'm regularly getting more sleep? I had initially gone down from 40mg to 20mg because of the anxiety. I might try to not take it on weekends or when I don't need it to narrow down if thats the cause.

The teeny bit of anxiety I used to get from Vyvanse was tolerable because it wasn't the level of anxiety I deal with from other sources. I wanted to try Guanfacine but my doctor wouldn't prescribe it alongside Vyvanse and said I'd have to stop that if I wanted to try it. So im feeling a little lost there.

That said I'm unfortunately going through a really emotionally rough breakup, from when I had that bad fever. And it very well could be not having the safety of my person, of that relationship, that could be causing this extra anxiety. 

I'd like to talk to a Psychiatrist but I've been on a wait list for over a year. And while therapy has been helping that feeling in my chest is still there.",2,1728568619.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

Dashing away in the middle of an October night, the two beamed with glee as they watched the city marker minimize out of view and dissipate from the northern interstate. Elated yet so inexperienced, the two fled to Las Vegas as they watched the high beams flicker in and out of the sky above. Hand in hand, they relaxed into one another’s touch as they anticipated the city’s lights. “Us against the world” they would say to one another, being so intoxicated with love that practicalities seemed insignificant. Stealing glances here and there, their eyes would briefly meet as the concept of time would begin to stop. Her stomach would flutter with joy, and his heart would race from  adrenaline. She would wonder what she would do without him, and he would silently pray that he was able to give her all that he knew she deserved. A lone cigarette would be shared between the two of them, her coughing on occasion only prompting a laugh from her other half. The cigarette would eventually falter altogether, and a vapor of smoke would linger as they both would exhale in contempt. A comfortable silence would bridge between them and they would simultaneously roll their windows down, reading one another’s mind just as they did the spirit. She would feel completely and utterly smitten, and he would mentally prepare himself for a life of praising her, pleasing a woman that he never believed would be his. 

Las Vegas would come into view at the break of dawn, and the worn Cadillac would park in front of a remote diner on the outskirts of the inner city. They would be seated, eagerly requesting a booth in view of the snowy mountains as they would make pleasant conversation over cups of coffee. She would take hers sweet, saturated in creamer and artificial sweetener that she illogically felt was a healthier option. He would in turn ask for black, sipping it slowly as he immersed himself in the story that his love would be reenacting as they awaited a shared omelet. Stories would turn into banter, and banter would turn into dreams, as they discussed all that would be of their new-found life. He would reach for her from across the booth, and almost as if she had stolen his thoughts her hand would connect halfway. Their eyes would lock once again, and the all too familiar feeling of slowed time would begin to creep upon them. She would smile sweetly, and he would grin smugly, growing a new fondness for their telepathic communication.

At night they would roam the streets, chasing the lights that illuminated the strip as their bodies swayed from the copious amount of alcohol circulating within their systems. She would lean upon him as he would shift his weight to lean against her. Together they would scramble down the boulevard, uplifting each other physically just as they did emotionally. Through their uneven strides, he would abruptly stop and stare at a sight before them. Confused, she would follow his gaze as her brown eyes would meet the entrance of a chapel. Her neck would whip around to meet his gaze, and her smile would simultaneously cause another rush of palpitations within his chest. Drunkenly, they would stumble into the chapel, presenting IDs that they prayed would fly over the officiant’s head. Time would once again slow, this time out of anxiousness rather than love, and their hands would tightly interlock with hope. The officiant’s eyes would occasionally flicker between the IDs and the groveling couple, internally questioning the legitimacy of two Wyoming state-issued IDs belonging to two individuals that were clearly under the age of eighteen. Prepared to bolt, Oliver would tighten his grip around his lover’s hand, prepared to run if the IDs were discarded within the moment. The officiant’s eyes would then rejoin the pairing as he would analyze Oliver’s defensive demeanor. In return, Oliver would kiss his love’s knuckles, subconsciously trailing his thumb over his kisses as he maintained eye contact with the skeptical facilitator. Silence would lie over the chapel as tension would carry on amongst the two of them, one waiting for the other to speak.

“I love him.” Angela would then proclaim. Breaking the two from their silent film of woes. “From the purest part of my heart, I look at him… and love him.” Her hand would then tighten around her love’s as his eyes bore into the pupils of the officiant. Silence would follow, time would once again still, and after several moments, the officiant would simply turn on his heels reluctantly motioning for the two to join him. The vows would be quick and prompted, for their drunken minds only held the capacity to say so much. He would look at her and she at him, and their vows would simply be what they managed to feel… what they’d always felt. Angela would then snatch the marriage certificate from the officiant only a millisecond after the last number had been dated, announcing to pedestrians amongst the streets her new title of Mrs. Till as she waved the certificate in victory. Oliver would subsequently follow, spewing a plethora of apologies to the officiant as he beamed with pride at the realization that she was proud to carry his name. The couple would find a cheap motel sometime later that night, and the two would collapse amongst the bed as the certificate would occupy a neighboring nightstand. He was hers, and she was his, now in law as much as principle. The two would sleep soundly beside one another, too inebriated to explore one another under the covers of the used mattress. Both would sleep soundly and awake with a whirlwind of irritability from the previous night’s cheap shots and booze, but when their eyes would meet the now ink-dried document they would appreciate the night’s decision. She would be thankful that he did not view their marriage as a drunken mistake, and he would vow to make her happy for the rest of his days. 

And just as the tales within the Wyoming pines were told, the two sixteen-year-olds would remain devout to their marriage. Cluelessly basking in their own affection, they would ignore the snail trail of turmoil left behind by their self-induced exile. They would hide away in the remote mountains of Nevada until two years had come and gone, and when all was well and they were far forgotten, they would resurface in Oregon. Families would wage wars against one another, pointing fingers at which lover was more impressionable. Accusatory and desperate, some would even question the willingness of the other partner to flee. The story of Angela Holland and Oliver Till would serve as a cautionary tale towards the youth of Jackson, warning young women to never waste their potential on the likes of degenerate men, while young boys were in return warned to never be fooled by a pretty face. Then as the tale would grow longer and gossipers polluted their love story with half-truths and bias… one of them would reappear.  Walking into a 24 hr diner on a December night, they would order a cup of coffee and sit until dawn. The other would be but a phantom, and they would remain tight-lipped concerning the location of their other half. Families would speculate and the law would become skeptical, but without a trace of their life since that October night they would be left to believe what the other would tell, which was absolutely nothing. The town would talk of Angela and Oliver,

For me:

•Veronica- always been a winter name to me, makes me picture an elegant lady in a nice, classy winter coat and a long scarf with a coffee in her hand, walking down the street with Christmas lights behind her.

• Delilah- makes me think of spring, just a bouncy, flowery sounding name to me. 

• Heidi- makes me think of summer, just a happy, sunny sounding name to me. I picture a Heidi in a red summer dress, with a sun hat, enjoying a nice picnic.

Live in England 

So I have a coffee machine that I bought at the beginning of the year from Very,I’m still within warranty. It’s faulty so I got in touch with her earlier, and they told me to get in touch with manufacturer and get an uplift number I think it was called or for one of their technicians to come and fix the machine. So I tried to get in touch with the manufacturer, but I’m wondering if as I bought it from Very and it’s still been warranty isn’t my contract with them? So wouldn’t I have to deal with them and they have to deal with the manufacturer?

I’m just not 100% on where I stand and I’d like to be a bit more informed before I get back in touch with Very to stand my ground if that’s what I can legally do.

Thanks for any help and advice. ",1,1728567890.0,LegalAdviceUK,2,1.0,False

1g0j29k,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACL/comments/1g0j29k/day_2_acl_allograft_and_possibly_because_spouse/,"Day 2 ACL Allograft and (possibly, because spouse can't remember what doc said!) meniscus trim","I am on day 2 of recovery from ACL surgery! I had my surgery yesterday morning, and I wanted to share my experience so far. It helped me a ton to read the same from others here, so hopefully this contributes to the knowledge pool.

I'm over 40, so my doc recommended the allograft, which is nice in that I don't have the additional area to heal. I'm just active and a runner and lifter, no extreme sports, so I'm pretty confident in his choice. This ortho group he works in is a very highly respected sports medicine clinic, they even treat our San Antonio Spurs. My spouse is the worst with remembering absolutely anything, and he thought they would also tell me (and they didn't) so all I can 100% attest to is that I don't have a meniscus repair with stitches and I think it was a debridement. I guess I will find out when I talk to the doc next.

I'm very glad for a couple of tips that made the surgery day better! Number one, I wore surgery shorts with snaps up the legs for surgery day. Getting dressed to go home was so much easier. Easily worth the $20.00 for me. I also brought a wedge pillow for the car ride home, and rode in the back seat. That was a great tip also because it made for a much more comfortable ride home. I will say that you need to work out the logistics of that with your driver first, because I not only confused the spouse with what I was trying to do, and the lady at the surgery center too. We figured it out eventually. I needed some pain meds immediately upon waking up, and after 2 doses, the pain was minimal. I'm not sure if my nerve block took very well. If I was guessing, I'd say no. I'll add to adjust the crutches before you leave the hospital. The bottom part was at the correct height for me, but the handles were so far off I couldn't even use them. We had to adjust them in the driveway when I got home so I could get into the house. Annoying. The spouse has an injured shoulder and I didn't want him trying to pick me up!

I went home, sat in the recliner with my leg propped, took my first dose of pain meds and slept. Felt pretty okay, just sleepy. Keeping the pain meds in my system helped a lot. By the end of day 1, I could also get around on the crutches a lot better. I had a yoga strap already, and that was amazing for looping around my ankle to lift my leg, because I couldn't. By midnight, I could lift my leg, although it was hard! I take the brace off if I'm not walking and life is much more comfortable that way.

I made a checklist with my pain meds with the time I was going to take them for three days, and made sure to stagger them for max pain coverage and effectiveness. I ended up being prescribed hydrocodone, gabapentin, meloxicam, and some dulcolax. They also gave me anti-nausea pills, but I haven't needed them. I followed the advice of taking the pain pills even though I don't feel terrible. My plan is to do so for the first 3 days, and then after that dial back the gabapentin or hydrocodone. I had double jaw surgery about 10 years ago, and learned my lesson about not waiting until it hurts!

I also got 3 gel ice packs with straps to secure them and rotate them so I have a nice freezie one to use. I have been putting one on about every hour, flipping it from the fleece side to the plastic side when it warms up enough, and just wearing it until it's not cold. ( [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPJ3NJFJ?ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_fed\_asin\_title](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPJ3NJFJ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) )

I got 2 different wedge pillows. One that's 7.5"" high and about 24"" wide. That one I used yesterday and in bed to sleep. My other wedge is slightly higher and made differently, and I'm using that one on my recliner today. I'm not using the extra part of the three piece one, because the height is perfect without it.  [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BB9SSTJK?ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_fed\_asin\_title](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BB9SSTJK?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) and [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4B8PXTZ?ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_fed\_asin\_title](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4B8PXTZ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)

I got a frame for the toilet, and THAT is a lifesaver! Especially because it was on sale for $22.00. If you have something to hold onto near your toilet, you probably can make do without it, but I don't. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C23FR438?ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_fed\_asin\_title](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C23FR438?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) I moved my little step stool in there to prop my leg, and it's perfect. That was a great tip! I also got a shower stool and a leg condom, and will be trying those out today. I think I could stand on one leg mostly in the shower and be fine, but I think the stool makes things a lot safer. I definitely don't want to fall! The leg condom is probably overkill. I will only need it for today as I'm cleared to get the site wet on day 3. I likely could have just saran wrapped it.

I stashed my brace next to the bed, and slept pretty good with the 7.5"" wedge. I took both of the pain meds about an hour before, and then right out bedtime, so they were at max dosage. When I woke up today, I put on the brace, crutched to the bathroom okay, and then got my other wedge pillow situated on the couch. I can one-crutch it, I learned, as I figured out how to transport my coffee to my table. It's much nicer with two crutches still though. I'll start my PT exercises today, and hurrah! On the road to recovery.

I'm off work for a week on sick leave, and cleared to work remote for 2 weeks after that. I ordered a lap desk today, because after sitting allllll day here, it would be nice to have a better work surface for when I actually have to do work again. I debated on buying arm crutches, but I don't think I'll even need the ones I have for too long. I'm just very slow moving.

Hope this helps someone!

I (24) daited my ex (33) for three years. We meet in bar where I used to work, and she was just flirting with me shamelessly as soon as she saw me. She was really straight forward about wanting to sleep with me, I had no idea I was gay back then. Of course I allways thought girls were hot and I loved making out with them, but never really thought about daiting a woman. She was really flirty with me, but not in uncomfortable or nasty way, more like in playfull way and I found that hot but I was kinda brushing her off for awhile. She lived one minute walking distance from that bar, so she was pretty much a regular, she would come every night have one drink, talked with me, trying to get my number and when I wouldn't give it she would allways say ""I'll see you tomorrow "" before she left. That was going on for two months and then one day she came with her few friends, she asked me if I'll finally let her buy me a drink cause it was her birthday. I told her okay, but then I'll buy her one too cause it was also my birthday. She was shocked to find out I'm not only a scorpio but also born on same day. Then she left the bar and left her friends there, she came back ten minute later with huge chocolate for me, that night she finally got my number.

We started to text every day, and she would still come there every night that I was working. I startes to realize that I'm really into her and we started going out. She was so sweet and patient with me, as she was first woman that I went out with she would allways make sure that I'm comfortable with everything. One night we both had a bit to much to drink and we went to her place, we were close to having sex when she just stoped and told me she wants our first time to be completly sober. Month later we had it, completly sober,  and she asked me hundred times if I'm okay with everything. We started daiting, and everything was perfect. Both familys suportive and we were just so in love. She was like a lesbian dream, she was to perfect, we were perfect. 

Then this past december things started happening at my family. My grandpa died sudenly few days after Christmas. He wasn't to old, and he was never sick, so that really took a tool on me. Then two months later my parents decided to get a divorce after 27 years off marriage, as my dad cheated on my mom with a girl that'seven younger then me. My parents love was something I allways looked up to, as I swear they were so in love and so carring off ecather, and then it just ended. Also my whole life I had perfect relationship with my dad, and now I'm sick on thought off him. That put me in really bad place, it came to point where I wasn't taking my college classes anymore, and I just closed myself in my room. I wouldn't really eat or anything. I would spend my days on my balcony, smoking cigarette after cigarette and day drinking.  She was only person, other then my twin brother, who then I let come close to me. I was only willing to speak to two off them, and I was really trying to still be functioning sister to him, and girlfriend to her. After a month off my life being like that, things started to get a bit better, I tryed to move on and act like nothing ever happened. I was still very much in love with her, and I tryed to spend time with her so I would make up for a month where I was just existing. And everything was good between us, but my sex drive just wasn't there. I eather didn't have any need for that, or we would do it and I just couldn't finish. And of course she was bothered by that, she would say how we went from having sex three times a day to now once a week and even then I would still fake it. I tryed talking to psychologist about it and I really wanted to get everything fixed. Then in late may this year I asked her if she would be okay if we go on family vacations with my mom and my brother. She said sure, but then in early june she broke up with me. She said she just can't deal rn with me wanting to be so close to my family, and that she really misses our sex from before.

I took our break up more like a break to be completly honest. She completly broke me, but I had hope that if I work on myself we could fix  everything, as I couldn't really belive she would let go off our relationship that easily. Few weeks ago I randomly bumped into her, I was with my friends in coffee shop and she was with her friends. We said 'hi' and shared a quick hug and that was it. I went home that night and I feelt like a mess, as I finally calmed down a bit after our break up, but then as soon as I saw her I was done. Days after that she texted me, saying how she misses me and how I'll allways be her biggest love, and how she'll never be able to love someone like she loved me. But then she also added how she feels bad for thinking that way cause she have a girlfriend. Three months after break up, and she already replaced me. And I'm just now coming to terms that we really broke up and that I don't have any chance with her. And it put me into really bad place again, but I honestly don't know what to do or how to pick myself up this time. I know this sound dramatic but it feels like my heart is in physical pain, and that feeling just wont go away.",1,1728567582.0,LesbianActually,0,1.0,False

I’ve been experimenting with light and medium roast beans using both a moka pot and a V60 pour-over, and I’ve noticed something interesting. For me, the moka pot consistently brings out richer, more intense flavors compared to the V60. The pour-over, while smooth, seems to fall a little flat in terms of flavor depth.

Is this something others have experienced too? Am I missing something with my V60 technique, as I heard v60 recipies are best when it comes to clean, washed light roast coffee beans to extract floral and fruity notes.

So, yesterday I broke no-contact after 49 days post-breakup. I’m the dumpee, and she’s the dumper. It wasn’t planned—I just happened to see her walking down the street. Funny enough, I had this feeling I was going to see her that day. I stopped and, since it was her birthday, I invited her for coffee. It was actually a really nice conversation—we caught up on what’s been going on in our lives.

Later that evening, I invited her out for a drink at a bar. She was hesitant at first, worrying she might hurt me, but after thinking it over, she agreed. We spent a few hours just talking, and it was really pleasant. I was surprised at how open she was about how she’s been feeling. She’s a bit of a dismissive avoidant, and honestly, everything she said after the breakup matched the typical DA stuff you read online. She even admitted to suppressing her emotions in the first few weeks and stalking my social media. She told me she was scared that I didn’t want anything to do with her anymore.

Overall, I see the meetup as positive. I got to show her how much progress I’ve made, and I didn’t push for anything. I just listened and shared my side too. We agreed we’ll meet again sometime, and she said she’ll text me when she's ready.

It’s the day after, and honestly, I feel good about it. The only thing that’s stressing me out a bit is if she’s gone back to the “relief stage"" again? I hope not. I left the door open a bit, but I also think she noticed that I’m not just waiting around for her.

1g0iwe2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrotesquerieFX/comments/1g0iwe2/fire_brimstone_a_look_at_episode_1/,Fire & Brimstone: A Look At Episode 1,"Before going in-depth into quotes and conversations, I will bring up a few visual aspects of this episode that stuck out to me:

When we first see Marshall in the hospital, he is set up to two IV bags - these bags are swirling **red and blue**. There are images of Jesus ""wearing red wrapped in blue"" to represent his humanity wrapped in his divinity. In the Bible, blue is meant to represent Heaven. Culturally, red could be viewed in this context to represent Hell or Satan. However, **could the use of these two colors be to represent humanity and divinity as a way for the writers/directors to hint towards a theme of, ""To be human is to sin""?** I don't know if it's necessarily that, but I do believe that the red and blue are meant to symbolize the battle between good and evil/Heaven and Hell.

Still with Marshall in the hospital, we see two young male nurses turning him **to avoid bed sores, like they're supposed to do.** We even see a large group of nursing students in the beginning. Where do they all go? If there were nurses in the beginning to turn Marshall to avoid bed sores, then perhaps the only reason he developed one later - and the reason why the hospital keeps getting more and more short-staffed - is because the good-hearted or decent-hearted staff members are all going missing...Even more, these male nurses are wearing **pink scrubs**.

Near the end of the episode, when Lois finally gets into bed with Marshall and speaks to him and shows love, the camera pans to **pink flowers**. Perhaps a symbol of goodness/purity (not just Heaven in general, which is blue)?

Now, let's talk about specific scenes/conversations/quotes, beginning with -

The Burnsides Murder.

The following conversation takes place between Jack and Lois:

**Jack: If this wasn’t a hate crime, I don’t know what is.** 

**Lois: Hate against what?**

**J: Everything.**

We establish, right off the bat, that this murder is just…hate, incarnated. Some all-consuming, indiscriminate evil. Right at this, also, the camera pans to a cop vomiting into a beautiful bush of flowers–\*\*red flowers and blue flowers\*\* surround them as he throws up into \*\*pink flowers.\*\* My first thoughts on this are: the Burnsides were ""good"" people, still killed in this battle of good and evil, hence the ""defilement"" (vomit) of the pink (pure/hope) flowers against the background of blue (good/Heaven) and red (evil/Hell/possibly humanity) flowers. I say the Burnsides were good because they were devout churchgoers in Father Charlie's church.

At the police station, the nun and Lois go to get coffee from the machine Marshall bought the 	precinct in the past. The nun says: 

**“...interested in rituals and cults and their place in American society right now. They’re** 		**replacing traditional worship and the way the battle between good and evil is manifested through them.”** If these are the End Times, then this is...well, pretty on the nose. I think that these ritualistic killings, specifically,  may be a means of continuing to ""summon"" Satan and the full apocalypse.

While Lois and Megan are speaking about the ""black goo"" (sulfur dioxide), Lois says, **“The smell changes every now and then, from citrus to amber, then rotting flesh and so on. A burning smell. Acrid.”** The amber, in my theory, is not part of the sulfur. Amber is fairly sacred within Biblical text. It is associated with priestly garments. It symbolizes divine glory, purity, and the sacredness of worship. If the smell of the sulfur was changing from its typical acrid smell to amber, perhaps the amber was not part of the smell at all, but a scent added to the scene that was clinging to the killer–amber incense, priestly garments…both of those would link with Father Charlie who, in this working theory, is a demon, a fallen angel, the antichrist, or Lucifer/Satan, and likely one of the killers if not the main. Or, maybe the amber scent was only mentioned (as far as I know; I'm continuing my rewatch later today) in this scene because the Burnsides are the only murder of ""holy"" people, and therefore their deaths would release the scent that symbolizes sacred worship within Biblical themes.

Here is a continuation of Lois and Megan's conversation about the murder:

**M: It’s an atrocity, a war crime; something that happens in places where there is no more hope, no more order.**

**L: Well…maybe that applies to here and now, and us.**

**M: I asked you before if you are a woman of faith, if you believe in the lord. Do you?**

**L: Do I believe someone died for my sins? Do I believe in divinity and the redemptive power of…of what? No. I do believe in prayer. You?**

**M: Half the time. Which is better than never.**

Is it, Megan? Is it better than never? It's not better than always, and as far as I know, in the End Times, you must accept God **fully** into your heart to walk with Him in the kingdom of Heaven. And...a war crime? Yeah, sounds like it...but perhaps this war crime is specifically targeted at Lois, these murders a way to mess with her and try to drive her even further into darkness and sin than she already is until her soul is **no longer capable of being saved.** Right now, yes, Lois is a sinner, but she is not yet so far gone that she has started abandoning her most tightly-upheld moral values (this point is important and comes up in my discussion of episode 2).

Now, the second murder -

The opening scene is Lois getting out of her car and walking up towards the house. Jack is there.

**L: Aren’t you supposed to be in the Galapagos?**

**J: Why go to the Galapagos when you have weekly mass murders right here? Nance took the kids.** 

Jack, like Lois, is a person who enjoys his vices. We are expected to believe that this overworked man gave up a trip to the Galapagos while his wife and children went? No, thank you. His wife and children aren’t in the Galapagos. They’re in Heaven, just like the kind male nurses who turned Marshall over to prevent bedsores and were then never seen again.

**“Me dereliquisti”** is written on the wall.

It is Latin for, ""You have abandoned me."" Are these murders perhaps not just taunting Lois, but a way for Satan/antichrist/fallen angel/demon (aka Charlie) to take subtle revenge on Earth's abandonment by God? Or is this just someone taking advantage of an opportunity, and stating the cause that makes them able?

The nun walks in and says, **""Romans 6,""** which speaks of baptism meaning that you are dead to sin and should live in the newness of life. Also speaks about how someone cannot serve two masters and highlights that choosing to sin leads to death, while obedience to God leads to righteousness and eternal life. “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Jesus Christ our Lord.” The sinners will die, the obedient will live. But would dying, in the End Times, simply return you to Earth? Would Earth as a battlefield not also be considered a lake of fire and brimstone?

Later on, Lois is back in Marshall's hospital room. She says to him:

**Something is happening and I need you. I can’t put my finger on it but I…I don’t know how it started. But it’s like a hole opened up in the world to the…to the center of nothingness. You would…you would say…Evil has always existed in the world, hon. You would quote some statistic that said there was less murder, more health, less global horror. Never been a better time to be alive, hon. That’s what you would say. I need you to come back, Marshall, because something’s not right. Something…something is happening around us. Nobody sees but me.**

My ""Fire & Brimstone"" theory involves Lois and Megan being prophets, or something similar. This quote is just one in a pile of her expressing these feelings. Throughout the first episode, Lois is continuously hinting about how she knows more and how something is deeply unsettling and off about the world, and she is not sure when it started. I believe it ""started"" with Covid, but it did not truly begin until 28 days prior to the first episode.

**M: As he was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in the newness of life. It’s interesting. Christ is crucified and walks again. The sinner is invited to walk with him, yet whoever did this has cut them in half. As if to say he is the final word on death. Or she.”**

**L: Whoever is doing the Devil’s work here is–**

**M: Fucking with you? \[...\] With the way things are today, horrible news and cataclysms at every turn, everything feels so personal to everybody.**

The killer knows that they are in the End Times. Angry at God's abandonment, they attempt to become the ""new god."" They are now the final word on death - killing both ""saints"" and ""sinners"" because God's forces no longer protect Earth in the same way. Those who otherwise would be able to seek redemption and salvation through God in death before being allowed into Heaven are now being killed through such specific, ritualistic means that it seems as though the specific reasons are to **trap and corrupt those souls, forbidding them from entering Heaven and perhaps even as a way to fill Hell/Earth with more condemned souls for Satan's army.**

While talking about the murders, Megan also says:

**""The breath of Yahweh, like a stream of brimstone doth kindle it.” Or “A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues, by the fire, the smoke, and the brimstone, which proceeded out of their mouths. Book of Revelations; always comforting, that one.""**

From the Book of Revelations:

""But for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death""

In the Bible, the first death is physical, and temporary through the grace of God. The second death is by fire and brimstone, and is permanent.

The presence of brimstone at the crime scenes are an indication of 1/3 of humanity being killed by ""the fire, the smoke, and the brimstone."" In the opening scene of this very episode, we see the curtain corner catching on fire, and then it pans to Lois waking up, an ash tray with cigarette butts spilling out, and then the curtain as it normally is.

In the part of the theory where Lois is a prophet and has intuition/visions regarding the apocalypse, I think that the curtain part could be one of these: She is beginning to have visions of the world ending in fire, smoke, and brimstone, OR that is how she died before her soul was simply returned to Earth because hell is empty, and the devils are there (Shakespeare, not the Bible, I know, but whatever).

That's all I have for now. There are a few other things in episode 1, but because they connect to later episodes, I'm saving those examples for that.

ETA: I had my non-quoted conversations, like the one between Merritt and Lois, in a separate document and forgot to pull it up when I made this point, so here it is as an edit:

Merritt and Lois work on a puzzle of witches surrounding Baphomet, Biblical theme. Merritt suggests repeatedly that something is wrong with Lois, and asks about her work for the first time. I do believe, like many others, that Merritt is dead. Rather than walk with God in Heaven, she is stuck on Earth/Hell. This part, though, may hinge entirely on the hope that one of the murdered ""sinners"" shows up later, like the homeless man pops up asking for change and she begins to spiral trying to figure out how he's alive again.

When they talk about the exercise bike, the 28 days/1 month timeframe is mentioned again. Could Lois' ""rash"" have been a blistering burn if she did die in a fire?

Another edit: That is, apparently, not all of my notes on episode 1 and my theory. I may edit this further later on or just make a new post later with the additional examples from episode 1, such as the homeless man's specific words - especially, **""I'll kill you in your black fucking soul.""** First watch, I thought he was just being racist, but given that he's also ranting about this being the end times and all, perhaps it's a hint that her soul is darkening and saving it is the only way for her to ""wake up.""",2,1728567130.0,GrotesquerieFX,1,1.0,False

What would be the best kitchen appliances for me to buy? Fortunately, money has been okay lately, so I could spend a few thousand.

Finally my question - what grind size?!

I watched the James Hoffmann video ""How To Dial In A Bean To Cup Machine (Like A Nerd)."" He said what I assumed - can't be ground as fine as an espresso shot. 

So what? Medium-course? Like a V60?

***Leveraging Alibaba's 1.28 billion annual active consumers and $3 trillion in gross merchandise volume to accelerate growth and global market penetration.***

**SCOTTSDALE, AZ / ACCESSWIRE / October 10, 2024 / CBD Life Sciences Inc.** (OTC PINK:CBDL), a trailblazer in the CBD industry, proudly announces a bold new step in its expansion strategy by targeting **Alibaba**, the world's largest retail and e-commerce platform. With an eye on global dominance, CBDL is set to offer its top-selling CBD products to Alibaba's vast wholesale marketplace, unlocking access to over **1.28 billion annual active consumers** and an astounding **$3 trillion in gross merchandise volume (GMV)**. This move marks a significant milestone in CBD Life Sciences' rapid ascent and positions the company for exponential revenue growth and global market penetration.

""Our entrance into Alibaba is more than just an expansion-it's a game-changer,"" said Lisa Nelson, President & CEO of CBD Life Sciences Inc. ""Alibaba's platform opens up access to markets we've only just begun to explore, and this leap forward will not only drive our revenue to new heights but will strengthen our relationship with valued shareholders, who are the backbone of our success.""

**Massive Opportunity: Alibaba's Wholesale Powerhouse**

Alibaba is the world's top e-commerce platform, facilitating over **$172 billion** in cross-border commerce annually. For CBD Life Sciences, this presents a massive opportunity to capitalize on the growing demand for high-quality CBD products in regions where CBD is rapidly gaining popularity. CBDL's flagship products-ranging from **nano CBD coffee creamers** and **pain relief creams**-will now be available to wholesalers across Asia, Europe, and beyond.

By tapping into Alibaba's extensive network of buyers, CBD Life Sciences is positioning itself as a leading supplier of CBD products to retailers around the globe. This expansion is expected to amplify both domestic and international sales, contributing to the already **1405.46% revenue increase** the company has experienced since February 2024.

**Unstoppable Growth and Shareholder Confidence**

Since early 2024, CBD Life Sciences has maintained an impressive upward trajectory, breaking records quarter after quarter. Shareholders have witnessed the company's evolution from a pioneering CBD startup to an industry leader with a diverse product line that caters to a growing market of health-conscious consumers. This expansion into Alibaba ensures that CBDL will not only maintain but accelerate this momentum.

As the global CBD market continues to surge-expected to exceed **$47 billion by 2028**-CBD Life Sciences is at the forefront, making decisive moves to capitalize on this trend. The entry into Alibaba represents a significant milestone, one that promises to multiply revenues and shareholder value in the coming quarters.

""With our entrance into Alibaba, we're taking the brand global at a scale we've never seen before. Our loyal shareholders are at the heart of this growth, and their support allows us to keep pushing boundaries, explore new opportunities, and bring cutting-edge products to consumers worldwide,"" added Nelson. ""Together, we will conquer new markets and achieve new heights.""

**Looking Ahead: Unwavering Commitment to Innovation and Expansion**

CBD Life Sciences Inc. remains committed to providing best-in-class CBD products, with a portfolio ranging from **water-soluble nano CBD** formulations to **CBD pain relief** solutions that continue to set industry standards. The company is also focused on future innovations, with new product launches expected in the upcoming quarters, all designed to deliver unrivaled quality and efficacy.

By leveraging Alibaba's vast wholesale distribution channels, CBD Life Sciences is laying the groundwork for **long-term growth and sustainability**. Shareholders can expect sustained success, as the company continues to execute on its aggressive global expansion strategy. Every step forward is an opportunity to deliver value and drive substantial returns for those who have invested in the company's vision.",1,1728566188.0,Pennystock,0,1.0,False

He took weeks to do his laundry, then grandma took a week to do hers. I brought my laundry down and was using the washer and dryer for about a day. This is important, its the foundation of this ridiculous situation I’m in. 
My dad and I were watching tv, while Grandma was asleep. As far as I know, she either slept through this whole event or she pretended to be asleep, she hasn’t said anything about it to me in two days, but she’s been asking about Hurricane Milton and politics and other stuff. Anyway, when the old man fell asleep. That’s fine, hunky dory, whatever. i put on Family Guy for him, and started playing on my phone. 
I hear the old man say “are you ever going to finish your laundry?” I just remember feeling angry, calling him an asshole, and I just started remembering the literal years of walking on egg shells because I was scared of setting him off, I remembered him throwing me through a wall when I was fifteen over not taking out the trash. I remembered the literal decade of my life I sacrificed because I pitied him, knowing I was all he really had, and then I just lost it. I (in very colorful language) asked how was it fair that I waited literal weeks to wash my clothes and he expected me to be done with all of it within a day, and he started screaming. He’s always been easy to make mad, and I unfortunately inherited that burden from him. The shouting match escalated when I flipped the coffee table and told him he can “go fuck himself”.
He punched me in the chin but I barely registered it, and I punched him back. We wrestled for a minute, and then I put him through a wall. He kept trying to fight me, grabbing my arm and punching me in the side of the head, then I just tossed him into the stairs. 
I stood over him and I punched him 4 times, I didn’t even know what I was doing. People say they black out or they see red, thats not right. I just felt something in my chest, I put years of resentment and anger over things I didn’t know were bothering me, and I just unleashed it on my dad. It wasn’t until I saw his blood on my hands that I stopped. 
Then I looked down at him, and I saw how he was scared. It made me feel pity, remorse and as disgusting as it sounds, satisfaction. 
And I hate myself for it. I beat him to a bloody pulp, and yet five minutes later, we were cleaning up the mess from the table in silence, and then he said “that was a good punch.”
I laughed, but I didn’t feel it. It felt like something he said to try to make the house less awkward. Even now, I don’t know why he didn’t throw me out. I’m over 18, he has no responsibility or obligation to let me stay here, I don’t even pay rent. I haven’t seen him since I work nights but I don’t know what I’m going to do from here. I don’t know how to feel, I feel like a monster because I beat the man who raised me to a pulp, I feel justified for doing it from the years of walking on egg shells and being “better person” and then I feel even worse for feeling that too. I feel a sense of dread walking through the house, and I feel confused.

I’m trying to inpaint rocket exhaust to look like coffee bursting out of a launching rocket, but I keep encountering white artifacts in the coffee. I’ve experimented with different settings and prompts, but nothing seems to work. I'm currently using an SDXL model.

Here are the details of my generation:

Any advice on how to avoid the white artifacts and get a clean coffee burst effect would be greatly appreciated!

1g0ihcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1g0ihcf/i_gave_everything_in_my_relationship_but_it_still/,"I gave everything in my relationship, but it still didn't work out. Is this how relationships are supposed to be?","I want to share a long story with you about a relationship I had. It happened in two parts - the first part was 3 years ago, and the second part started about a year ago.

Part 1: How We Met

Three years ago, when I was in my second year at university, I became the president of an engineering club. This was a big deal for me. I got to meet lots of new people and work on cool projects. Our club was a great place for students who loved engineering to come together and be creative.

One day, during a club meeting, I saw her for the first time. She was new to the club and a year older than me. The moment I saw her, I really liked her. There was just something special about her - maybe it was how confident she seemed or how smart she looked. Even though I liked her right away, I tried not to show it.

After about 2-3 weeks, we started hanging out more. We'd get coffee after club meetings and sometimes have lunch together. We talked about all sorts of things, from engineering to our dreams for the future. It felt really good, and I thought maybe something special was starting between us.

After three weeks, I decided to tell her how I felt. I sent her a message saying I liked her. She didn't answer right away, just said we should talk about it the next day.

The next evening, she messaged me back. She said, ""I know we never talked about this, but I have a boyfriend."" I felt really bad when I read this. I didn't say anything back to her for a week.

After a week, she messaged me to see if I was okay. I said I was fine, and we started talking again. I asked her why she didn't tell me about her boyfriend earlier. She said her relationship wasn't going well and that her boyfriend lived far away.

I know I probably shouldn't have, but I kept talking to her and seeing her for about 2 months. I still liked her, and she knew it, but she was still with her boyfriend.

After two months, I couldn't take it anymore. I told her I didn't want to see her anymore. We had a small argument and stopped talking. During those two months, I had started to fall in love with her, but she wasn't breaking up with her boyfriend.

We didn't see each other for 2 years after that. During this time, she finished university and moved back to her hometown.

Part 2: Reconnecting

A year ago, I had also finished university and started a job I really loved. I was working from home, doing software and electronics work.

I was feeling good about my life and my job, so I thought maybe it would be okay to talk to her again. I sent her a message on social media, and we started talking again.

We talked every day after that. She told me about her life and how she was feeling. We also talked about the old times when we first met.

She told me that for the past 2 years, she had been trying to find a job but couldn't. This was making her feel really sad and worried. She didn't have a boyfriend anymore.

For about 4 months, we flirted with each other. Even though we lived in different cities, I tried to show her that I cared about her. Sometimes she would mention that she needed something, and I would order it for her home. This made me happy because I was starting to love her again.

During this time, she was always sad because she couldn't find a job. It was really hard for her. She kept trying to get a job, but nothing worked out. This made her feel bad all the time.

I wanted to help her feel better. I helped her with her resume, practiced job interviews with her, and asked people I knew if they had any job openings. I also tried to be there for her when she was feeling down. I listened to her problems and told her she was smart and good at many things. I tried to plan fun things to do to help her forget about her worries.

Even though I was trying my best, sometimes I felt like I couldn't really help. It was hard to know what to say or do. I wanted to be positive, but I also knew her problem was serious.

After 4 months, she came to visit the city where I lived. I planned a nice day for us. We walked around the city, went to restaurants, and at the end of the day, I asked her to be my girlfriend. She said yes!

Our first month as a couple was really good. I felt happy in this relationship. I thought I had found the woman I wanted to marry. I helped her with everything, both with money and emotional support.

After our first month together, she told me she was coming to stay with her sister in my city for 2-3 months. I was so happy because it meant we could see each other every day.

She was still feeling bad about not having a job and complained about it a lot. I told her I was there for her and that I could help her with money if she needed it.

When she arrived, we met 2-3 times in the first week. These meetings were nice and fun. But after a while, she started saying no when I asked to meet. She would say things like ""I want to be alone at home"" or ""It's too hot outside."" At first, I thought it was okay, but it started happening more and more. Soon, we were only meeting once every 2 weeks.

I noticed her attitude towards me was changing. Here are two examples:

1. One time, she went out with her sister to an event. Later, when she was on her way home, we were messaging. I asked if she wanted to meet the next day. She suddenly stopped answering for an hour. I got worried and called her. She didn't answer, but 15 minutes later she messaged me saying, ""Why are you calling me? You know I don't like talking on the phone. I came home and went to shower, I didn't check my phone."" This really hurt me, and I ended up apologizing to her.
2. Another time, we were at a shopping mall. I saw a photo booth and said, ""Let's take some photos!"" We took a few, but she kept telling me how to pose. After a while, she got bored and left the booth without even taking the photos.

When I asked her why she was acting different, she always said, ""I feel bad because I can't find a job. I'm going through a tough time. Try to understand me."" When she said this, I always gave in because I knew she was having a hard time.

During the 2 months she was in my city, we only met about 6-7 times. We mostly just messaged each other. She doesn't like talking on the phone, so I couldn't call her.

I started feeling bad all the time. This relationship was making me sad and less motivated. I even started experiencing something called ""derealization,"" which is a kind of anxiety problem.

In our third month together, I couldn't take it anymore. I said to her, ""I'm always trying to understand you and do what you want. Can't you try to do the same for me sometimes?"" She didn't really answer my question. I realized things weren't going to get better, so I told her I wanted to break up. And we did.

Thank you for reading all of this. Now, I want to ask: Why didn't this relationship work, even though I gave her everything? I loved her, spent time with her, and shared everything with her. This experience has made me scared to meet new people or start new relationships. I gave her everything, but she wouldn't even answer my phone calls. Is this how relationships are supposed to be?

Also, the idea of a new relationship doesn't excite me anymore. How can I overcome this feeling and open myself up to new possibilities?

  
TL;DR: Met a girl in university, and fell for her but she had a boyfriend. Reconnected years later, started dating. I supported her through unemployment and personal issues. The relationship became one-sided, with her becoming distant and unresponsive. Despite my efforts, it ended after 3 months. I'm left wondering if this is what relationships are supposed to be like and how I can overcome my fear of starting new relationships.",1,1728565921.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Hi 

This might be a bit of a rant and I’m sorry. 

It’s important to the story to know that I have issues with food. I’m working on it, but it’s still a work in progress. 

Today I went to a cafe and ordered a coffee and a cinnamon bun. I politely asked the barista if they could cut it in half and just keep the rest, to either share or throw out, or whatever. He said “I could pack it for you to take home?” And I said no thanks I can’t. Which I know is a pretty weird answer. 

Anyway I don’t think my request was too weird. I heard another barista make a comment about it being wasteful, but it’s my money so who cares.

He comes to my table with the cinnamon bun, the whole thing. It had been cut in half though. He says to me “just eat the smallest half” and that really felt like a dig at me. I feel that was intentionally mean. 

It made me upset and now I had this full cinnamon bun in front of me and I felt horrible. I felt like an idiot. I know it’s just a cinnamon bun and life happens, but I really feel like my request wasn’t unreasonable and I did feel like he was intentionally being mean to me. 

I endend up not eating any of it, I also spoke to the manager. I know that might sound very Karen of me, but I just wanted to explain my experience so that they could maybe be made more aware of people with similar issues to me. I wasn’t mad or anything. 

I thanked the manager a lot, she was very kind to me and said she would talk to him tomorrow.

Anyway this has been a rant about a pretty mundane experience, but I needed to get it out :,> ",1,1728565886.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

So, you’ve decided to take your coffee obsession to the next level: roasting beans at home. Bold choice. But where do you even start with picking the best beans? It’s like picking grapes for wine—different origins, flavors, and roast levels can make a huge difference. Let’s get into the essentials so you can dive in and roast like a pro.

# First Thing’s First: Coffee Bean Origins Matter

Believe it or not, where your coffee beans come from affects everything from flavor to aroma. Think of it like wine terroir, but for coffee.

* **South America** (Brazil, Colombia, Peru): Known for balanced acidity and rich, chocolatey flavors.
* **East Africa** (Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania): Bright, fruity flavors with a punchy acidity.
* **Southeast Asia** (Indonesia, Vietnam): Earthy, herbal, and often a bit bolder.

# Processing Methods: How Beans Get Their Mojo

The way beans are processed impacts flavor *big time*. Here are the two main methods:

* **Washed Processing**: Cleaner and brighter flavors. The beans are stripped of their skin and pulp, which keeps the flavors crisp and clear.
* **Natural Processing**: Fruity and sweet, thanks to drying the beans with the fruit intact. Adds complexity to the cup.

# Flavor Profiles: What You’re Tasting

The beans you pick influence how your coffee will taste once roasted. Here are the main flavor families:

* **Fruity**: These beans have bright acidity and sweetness, often with notes of berries or citrus.
* **Chocolatey**: Think rich, smooth, and dessert-like. Perfect for chocolate lovers.
* **Nutty**: Earthy, with flavors that can be a little more mellow and grounded.

# Picking Your Roast Level: Light, Medium, or Dark?

Every roast level brings out a different side of the beans, so get ready to experiment!

* **Light Roast**: Brings out the bean’s natural flavors, acidity, and brightness. You’ll taste the origin more with a light roast.
* **Medium Roast**: A middle ground, with a balance of bean flavors and roast characteristics. Smooth and approachable.
* **Dark Roast**: Rich, bold, and full-bodied. It’s all about the roast flavor with minimal acidity.

# The Must-Haves for Top-Notch Beans

When picking beans for home roasting, these factors make all the difference:

* **Freshness**: Freshly harvested beans are essential for a vibrant roast. Look for beans that are just a few weeks old.
* **Quality**: High-altitude beans, ethically sourced. Look for specialty-grade or single-origin for the best quality.
* **Price**: Price varies with quality and rarity. You don’t have to go for the priciest, but sometimes a little extra cash goes a long way in flavor.

# FAQ: Your Burning Questions Answered

**Q: What’s the “best” origin for coffee beans?**

A: It’s totally personal. Start with popular origins like Ethiopian for fruity or Colombian for balanced, then experiment from there.

**Q: Washed or natural processing?**

A: Washed for a clean cup, natural for more fruity sweetness. Try both and see which vibe you’re into.

**Q: How do I know the right roast level for me?**

A: Light roasts for bright, complex flavors. Dark roasts for bold, smoky notes. Try a few levels to find your match.

# Top Picks: Beans to Try for Home Roasting

Here are a few bean types that’ll get you started and give you a range of flavors:

* **Blue Mountain** (Jamaica): Balanced acidity, smooth, rich body. Perfect for a light-medium roast.
* **Ethiopian Yirgacheffe**: Fruity and floral. Best roasted light to capture those unique flavors.
* **Colombian Supremo**: Balanced, chocolatey, with a touch of sweetness. Works well as a medium roast.

# Tips for a Killer Roast Every Time

Getting the perfect roast isn’t a one-time deal—it’s a process. Here’s how to make sure you’re doing it right:

* **Use a Thermometer**: Get the roast just right by keeping an eye on temperature.
* **Watch the Beans**: Check the color, smell, and sound (yes, you’ll hear cracking) during the roast.
* **Experiment!**: Start with different roast levels and see how each one impacts flavor.

With the right beans and a bit of trial and error, you’ll be roasting up custom flavors that bring out the best in every cup. Now go on, bring that coffee shop magic to your kitchen!",1,1728565740.0,thecaffeinehit,0,1.0,False

For context I work very close to home, about a mile or 2. I told her that frankly I didn't want to leave work just to bring her a soda and she got super upset.. telling me not to talk to her for the rest of the day and that I would need to sleep somewhere else tonight (not in the bed, not gtfo the house). I told her I would cashapp her some money to get a drink instead since our 2nd vehicle is currently out of commission and she cant drive to the store to get a drink herself.. So I sent her 20$ and she sent it back along with several long texts about how if the roles were reversed she would have done it in a second and that I apparently have no empathy and might not actually love her etc... I told her if she is really dying for caffeine there is tea/coffee at the house she could make but she insists those just don't work the same...

  
In my mind I'm thinking that even though I'm so close to home leaving for 15 minutes just to bring my Fiancée a soda is kind of silly.. Especially when I even offered to just pay for her to get one brought to her via doordash or something. She says thats not the point and now I'm just a big asshole because I don't want to leave work to bring her a soda, and apparently I don't love her because I lack the empathy to understand how important this is to her... I do stuff like this all the time for her where I will leave work and come back and just didn't really feel like doing it today.

So tell me, AITA for not bringing her a soda when she could order one, or make tea, or make coffee? am I really missing a bigger picture here that most people would jump to do this for their significant other no matter what?",2,1728565670.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

https://preview.redd.it/awhiea1qgxtd1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bf60e575bca0398e74338432446f8e50a061b6

So, you’ve invested in a fancy bean-to-cup coffee machine that’s bringing café vibes to your mornings. Nice. But like any good relationship, it takes a little TLC to keep things working. Here’s the lowdown on keeping your machine in top shape.

# Why Bother with Maintenance? (Spoiler: It’s Worth It)

I get it, the idea of scrubbing down a coffee machine every day sounds… excessive. But here’s why you should:

* **Flavor Savior**: Dirty machines = weird coffee. You don’t want yesterday’s grinds ruining today’s shot.
* **Longer Lifespan**: Machines live longer when they’re loved.
* **Energy Efficiency**: Clean machines use less power. Who knew?
* **Fewer Repairs**: Less gunk buildup means fewer surprises at the repair shop (and a happier wallet).

# Step 1: Cleaning—Your Machine’s New Best Friend

It’s like brushing your teeth; it’s annoying, but skipping it is *not* an option.

# Daily Cleaning Checklist:

* **Wipe It Down**: Give the machine’s exterior a quick wipe with a damp cloth.
* **Grinds Container**: Empty it, wipe it out. Old grounds smell, and nobody wants that.
* **Run a Cleaning Cycle**: If your machine has one, use it. Otherwise, a vinegar-water mix does the trick.

# Weekly Deep Clean:

* **Descale**: We’ll get to this, but yes, it’s part of the routine.
* **Flush the System**: Run a cleaning solution through the machine. It’s like giving it a cleanse.
* **Scrub the Surfaces**: A damp cloth and a little elbow grease go a long way.

# Step 2: Descaling—The Secret to Great Coffee

Ah, scale—the nemesis of all things coffee-related. If you’ve got hard water, you’ve probably got scale. This mineral buildup messes with the taste *and* the machine.

# Descaling Steps:

1. **Check the Manual**: Not every machine is the same, so check the instructions to avoid any oops moments.
2. **Use a Descaler**: There are solutions just for coffee machines. Pour it in and let it work.
3. **Rinse Thoroughly**: Make sure no descaler residue is left. You don’t want it messing with your espresso.

# Step 3: Troubleshoot Like a Pro

When your coffee machine acts up, try these fixes before calling in reinforcements.

* **Power Issues**: If it’s not turning on, check the plug, the fuse, or the circuit breaker. Sometimes, it’s that simple.
* **No Heat?**: Could be the water reservoir is empty or the heating element has a clog.
* **No Coffee Output**: Make sure your grounds container isn’t full and the water reservoir has, you know, water.

# Maintenance Schedule: When to Do What

# Daily:

* Wipe down.
* Clean grinds container.
* Run a quick cleaning cycle.

# Weekly:

* Descale if needed (hard water users, that’s you).
* Wipe down every nook and cranny.

# Monthly:

* Deep clean cycle.
* Check or replace the water filter.

# Every 3-6 Months:

* Big descale session.
* Run a full cleaning solution through the machine.

# FAQs: Because You’ve Probably Got Questions

**Q: How often should I descale?**

A: Every 3-6 months or if you’re noticing a drop in taste quality. Hard water areas? More often.

**Q: What’s the best cleaning solution?**

A: Stick with coffee machine-specific cleaners. They’re gentler and more effective than DIY stuff.

**Q: What if I still can’t fix an issue?**

A: Check the user manual, or get help from the manufacturer. They know their machines better than your best friend’s cousin’s advice.

# Wrap-Up: Treat Yo’ Machine Right

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop. So click on one of the links above so you can get your very own copy of “MomPreneurs”, a very serious well thought out business guide for moms.*  ",1,1728565301.0,OOALMarketing,0,1.0,False

this is my second subreddit in this app i had my account one year ago but i haven’t used it, but i feel like the community here is supportive and helpful so i would like to share my story 

I’ve been struggling with severe anxiety for nearly a decade, and it feels like it’s paralyzed my life. I used to run a business, but constant worry over every order and shipment consumed me. The fear that something might go wrong, that a package would arrive broken or a customer would be unhappy, was overwhelming. This constant state of anxiety not only sabotaged my business but also took a toll on my relationships. also i have been struggling with anxiety since i was a child i was extremely afraid to vomting,death,getting sick and a ton of other things that i can’t really remember currently, i carried out big feelings in my small body💔

Since 2017, I’ve also been dealing with depersonalization, after i had a fight with my group back in middle school they were bullies and toxic and everyone turned their back at me i felt so betrayed that i kept crying and crying nonstop till i felt so numb after that i went to bed to sleep, that day changed my life forever literally, the time i opened my eyes and felt like i was in a dream state that feeling was unforgettable and now thinking about i had no idea that im going to have it for the next years, a challenging condition that makes me feel disconnected from myself and my surroundings It’s as if I’m watching my life from the outside, unable to fully engage or find joy. This has been an incredibly tough journey, and I’m sharing it here in the hope of finding support and letting others know they’re not alone.

I know i got so much potential, Im smart and capable of doing so many things, and im planning to start my arabic coffee food truck business here in australia next year because it’s a golden opportunity, im originally from middle east so after 3 years im going back to my home country after completing my studies, and i don’t wanna waste this opportunity since the australian community is supportive with small businesses but i’m too scared to do it and repeating the same experience all over, like i said my anxiety is ruining everything

He is completing a fairly challenging stem degree and so I accepted he would have to commit more time to his work, but his reconnection with mathematics has become concerning.

He now spends a majority of his day 'studying mathematics', despite the fact I often see very little work being done. When I ask him how his work is going, he gets very defensive and refuses to open up, claiming it's in my best interest because 'it will be boring to me anyway'. He then retreats to his room, where I hear either classical music, or the now familiar voice of youtuber 'The Maths Sorcerer' through the door (Some kind of mathematics based motivaitonal guru).

He also has taken up chainsmoking during the day, which although I'm personally not too bothered by, has become another issue where he becomes very defensive. He regularly sends me studies and reddit anecdotes about the efficacy of chainsmoking as a nootropic, and how universities like MIT are littered with cigarette smoke from 'high performance humans'.

He goes so far as to tell me that all of the greats such as Betrand Russel, Einsten and 'Rachmandynoff'(?) were all habitual smokers (Anyone know who tf that last person even is?)

I've tried to contact his friends to see if he shares more about his new secretive lifestyle with them, to which I was told that he basically just talks about drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes, eating eggs and doing mathematics without going into any further detail.

I feel like he has completely changed personalities and lives as some kind of isolated savant rather than my loving boyfriend and I have to fight to even spend time together. I want to try and maybe meet him where he's at and become more interested in what he's doing, but he just keeps everthing so secretive? Has anyone else had experience dealing with a boyfriend who gets obsessive about things?

# Yemeni Coffee in High Demand

Before the recent war in Yemen, we knew exactly how much coffee was exported to neighboring countries and the world. According to some statistics, Yemen produces around 12,000 tons of coffee, with 70-80% consumed locally. Approximately 3,000 tons are exported, with 700 tons going to Western countries, mostly the U.S. and Japan, and about 2,000 tons to neighboring countries. Now, due to the ongoing war entering its ninth year, there are no accurate data.

One of the main factors for the high price of Yemeni coffee is that Yemenis were the first to turn it into a drink, transforming a wild tree into a cultivated crop. Yemenis were the first to roast and brew coffee in the way we know today. Thus, Yemeni farmers see their coffee trees as gold mines, forming a unique bond with these trees, which can live for over 120 years.",1,1728565018.0,CoffeeYemen,0,0.99,False

Around this time last year, the bond between myself and my best of nearly 15 years was falling apart. Over now. I'm in the stage where I've grieved and I don't want her in my life, but I have so many questions.

She was never formally diagnosed to my knowledge, but a few things strongly suggest it:

-two years ago her family doctor suggested she was not bipolar, but BPD. I only know this because she invited myself and her sister to breakfast to tell us this and laugh it off. 

-Really high friend turnover rate. The highest of anyone I've known. She would often gravitate towards emotionally unstable or just insufferable people (for the latter think big ""not like other girls"" energy). They'd be the best people she'd ever met until suddenly they weren't on speaking terms and we had to be told how awful they'd been to her.

-She started having low opinions of mutual friends where, despite my suggestion she talk it out with these people, she'd rant to me about them behind their backs and suck up to them when face-to-face. 

-She'd accuse some of her friends I don't really know (but other friends of mine do) of acting really out of character: I.e--a straight girl apparently groped my friend in public but nobody saw it and my friend never confronted her on it (and butters up this girl on social media fairly frequently)

As these things became more apparent to me, we'd argue. Once that started happening, I found myself being ""unpersoned"". No longer invited to hang out unless it was in a group with other people she'd ranted to me about over the years. Not invited to house parties she was throwing. Daily texting with lots of lovey-dovey things stopped completely (she'd always end convos with ""I love you"" and no, we never dated). Rather than continue the friendship as a C-list friend, I told her we didn't need to hang out anymore and I wouldn't be asking/offering to socialize because we were clearly finished and I wanted us both to enjoy our lives and not hang out due to obligation.

I just wanted to be clear, state boundaries, but still be clear that I cared and that this wouldn't end in hatred. I couldn't have been more wrong. First, I noticed that friends of hers left and right were blocking me within a week of this happening, coinciding each time with a post on social media about how the person who just blocked me was one of their only ""REAL"" friends.

Next came conversations with my roommate. My roommate was once friends with my suspected pwBPD, but they fell out. She lured my roommate back for a coffee date, but it was just an excuse to badmouth me and say thing that both I and my roommate know are untrue.

Following that, randos. People I'd never met were trying to add me on social media. Some of whom aped her style of publicly posting about real friends and all that (tagging her). Then I started getting a handful of phone calls from unknown numbers, taunting me about personal things only she would know or telling me I should kill myself (I have a history of depression and have attempted suicide in the past). The voice sounded male, so it wasn't her, but I suspect she put him up to it (I suspect it's her current boyfriend). The calls stopped around December and my life was never threatened, but that's still harassment. 

This sounds like highschool drama gone wrong, right? The icing on the cake is that she and I are both pushing 40.

Enough context. I suspect my ex-bff was/is a pwBPD. Symptoms unnoticeable at first, but appeared/worsened from 2020 onward. How do you cope with someone you thought you'd be talking to in your 80s launching a smear campaign against you and riling up others to harass you? How do you find peace? When does it stop? Why did she attack as I was ""leaving"" her (again, not romantic partners) and she clearly had lost interest in me and started to devalue me?

I am looking to do a lease takeover on my room in bed-stuy starting Oct 15 (ideally) or Nov 1. The lease would end April 30, but you have the option to renew. $1017/month for the room with an additional $1017 deposit. It would be a lease takeover so you’d need to be able to prove you make 3x rent to property mgmt. 

The apartment is a 3 bedroom located in a Brownstone very close to J trains. It is walkable to the Maria Hernandez AND HVK. Near lots of bars, coffee shops, thrift store. The street is very quiet and well maintained, I’ve literally never seen a rat. 

You’d be living with two others, both men in their mid 20s (one is queer.) One is finishing up art school and is frequently away, the other is a teacher who’s typically gone from 7-4. The room is on the opposite side of the apartment as the other two.

I’ve been living in this room for a year and a half, I’ve never seen a roach. The room gets nice sunlight throughout the day! Big enough that you could fit a desk + dresser + full bed. There are only two other units, the neighbors  are nice and not noisy !!

There is no laundry in building, but two laundromats very very close. Utilities not included but less than $70 a month typically. The apartment is 420 friendly, no animals (unless you have hypo-allergenic cat)
Moving out because my partner and I are moving in together to our own place. 

If interested pls pls dm! Would love to get someone in here by the 16th(ish)! Photos attached!! Also awesome vintage chaise lounge in the living room. Note my roommates may be open to living with a couple again in which case the rent would be reduced, but one person would have to meet the x3 $1017 income requirement ",1,1728564967.0,NYCapartments,0,1.0,False

I’d like to give a warm thank you for all you locals reading this. I used your posts and comments to make my honeymoon wonderful. I come from a similar tourist destination town (although mine is in end of spring) and I have to say I really loved Salem. We didn’t do as much of historic stuff as we planned but the places we did hit were interesting and memorable. I’m an artist and so I made it a mission to hit up all the artist spots I could find. 

Hive & Forge 10/10 spent $150 there and even husband was impressed. If you’re a local artist feel free to message me so I can give you a follow and all my money. The Salem Flea market 10/10 same thing there. I didn’t see it mentioned anywhere but it was a great surprise. 

Everywhere we went for food was fantastic. Highlights were Brodie’s Parmesan Haddock and the Gyro Spot (husband made us go there twice despite being gluten intolerant) 10/10 
OH AND GOODNIGHT FATTY’S  100/100 sugar high was worth it 

Spellbound tours was another great recommendation especially as I kept reading here people pissing on larger companies spreading misinformation. Give me the gritty truth not the stories that seem flashy.

Count Orlak’s was very endearing to me since I used to watch all the old horror movies with my dad who unexpectedly passed away earlier this year. The workers there were very friendly tolerant to all the other tourists who acted like it was playground.

Artemisia Botanica was a great shop. The person who helped me in there was very friendly and full of good advice. I’m excited to try my new teas.

As a tourist from a tourist town if you’re not supporting locals GO HOME. You can buy the same cheaply made “got stoned in Salem” shirt on Amazon. 

Every street performer we saw was talented and dedicated. I hope you all got paid fairly for your time.

LASTLY today we’re leaving town and stopped at a Dunkin’ cause hubby wanted a quick coffee. Ya’ll were NOT IMPRESSED with my comfy car clothes of a tank top and snoopy lounge pants. I guess comfy clothes outside of the house is just a Midwest thing…

Anyways thank you to all the locals who made the trip what it was. I’d love to come back when it’s not as busy and continue to support you. 

Thank you Salem.

P.S. The husband’s comments : hates your roads but appreciates how you all seem willing to let people in front of you on the road. Only mild Mass-holes. ",34,1728564675.0,SalemMA,10,0.9,False
1g0i1ux,https://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/news/2024/10/09/alton-revival-john-simmons-downtown.html,Inside one man's mission to revive a Metro East city,"Today, Simmons, the founder and chairman of Alton-based law firm Simmons Hanly Conroy, is single-handedly bankrolling a plan to make the historic riverfront city both a national destination and a local attraction for tech companies and foodies alike. Since 2018, entities tied to Simmons or his redevelopment company, AltonWorks, have acquired 60 properties in Alton, including 25 vacant, historic buildings in the city's downtown, for future redevelopment or preservation. It's embarked on a project to provide high-speed internet access to all corners of the community. It's launched an effort to create a national park in Alton along the Mississippi River.

A few factors run in the city’s favor. The vast supply of vacant historic buildings dating from when Alton was a larger city lend it character, and its location on the Mississippi River is already an asset for tourism. It also has history: Founded in 1818, it was a hub for steamboat commerce, and later hosted stops on the Underground Railroad, a law office of Abraham Lincoln and was the site for the seventh and final of Lincoln's famous series of debates with Stephen Douglas during their 1858 U.S. Senate campaigns.

Great Rivers National Park, which would be the only national park in Illinois if Congress was to approve it, would take years to develop, but could eventually put Alton on the national map, bringing in outside dollars and tourism, AltonWorks' leaders believe.

With or without the national park, the ultimate goals of AltonWorks, which employs a team of 26 people, is to make Alton more of a destination for tourists and foodies, open a technology innovation center with fiber internet that would reach 90% of the city, and create apartments to attract new residents and rehab other vacant buildings along the way, including the historic Grand Theatre and the Stratford Hotel.

A few AltonWorks projects are already open. The Flock Food Truck Park and Bar is open daily with local food options, and Post Commons, a coffee shop and brunch restaurant created inside a historic post office, advertises itself on Instagram as “Alton’s living room.”

The Jacoby district will be anchored by AltonWorks’ most significant project to date: the $32 million Wedge Innovation Center, now in the final stages of construction, which is expected to open later this year. It will serve as the center of the organization’s efforts to make Alton a digital hub. To develop it, AltonWorks combined two historic buildings, the wedge-shaped former Wedge Bank building and the Elfgen, into one 55,000-square-foot social impact center, research lab, think tank and coworking space.

AltonWorks' next project, the $11 million Lucas Row apartments, is underway and will be finished by construction firm BSI Constructors as soon as the contractor completes the Wedge, AltonWorks officials said. The historic building at 601-611 E. Broadway, across the street from the Wedge, is being converted into 12 apartments and restored retail storefronts, with assistance from $2 million in tax increment financing from the city of Alton.",4,1728564640.0,StLouis,0,1.0,False

We’ve had this talk plenty of times, she wakes up and taps me on my shoulder “baby wake up” yesterday she woke me up while I was in the middle of a good dream, asking me “what’s your plan for the day?” Every other day she makes extra noise with her feet (she drags her feet instead of picking them up every step) and her sandals make it worse. She also lets the baby gate slam shut, we have one in our room to prevent my dog from coming in. 
Instead of quietly or slowly guiding the gate to close, she just lets it slam shut causing a loud noise to wake me up. This morning she had her phone alarm going on right next to me and she wouldn’t stop it, she kicked me with her knee (looking for attention) and she tapped me again on my back to wake up (after I asked her last night to please let me sleep) once im awake, eyes still halfway open, she decides to take her chance and start a conversation, if I don’t keep my eyes closed she’ll tell me to go help her fill her Stanley or make her coffee or a sandwich. Today proceeded to get my attention asking me questions about nonsense, the last one was my opinion on her new heels.

I’ve told her many times that she’s selfish, self centered and doesn’t have compassion for me.

If it’s 6:30am and she wakes up horny, and I’m deep asleep, she’s waking me up without any regard for my sleep and expects me to do all the work to make her cum. I’m not against morning sex but damn I’m deep in my sleep… 

She works at 8:30am so she’s up by 7:30am, she works 30mins away so that gives her 30mins to get ready, sometimes less because she will leave the bed at 7:45 most times. I own my business so I don’t have a set time. We go to sleep at 11:30, whenever she decides to, I can’t sleep with noise or lights on so I go to bed once she’s in bed. I have helped her many times with her morning breakfast but it is not my job, she can wake up earlier and do it herself she can also do all her morning activities quietly. If I stop doing her breakfast for her, a day or two after she’ll throw it in my face in a mean way and say “you don’t do my breakfast anymore, you don’t love me” 
I seriously doubt she would take initiative to wake up and help me with my breakfast if I had to work at 6am. Help is out of love, it’s not forced, I’m not your maid! Btw she grew up with maids so this behavior might be ingrained in her. 

It’s possible to get ready, cook etc without waking the other person up AND I showed her how it can be done because when she was without a job, still in school and would wake up late 11ish, I would be super quiet while getting ready, because commons sense dictates “let the woman sleep” 

Some of you will tell me “we’ll wake up earlier so she doesn’t wake you up” if I wake up earlier I’m getting out of bed at 5am and going for a run with my dog then going to the gym and I won’t be back till after she’s gone which will then trigger her to say “are you cheating on me ? You don’t give me morning love anymore and you prefer to spend time with your dog and gym than with me”
It’s a never ending battle with her. I keep telling her “I just want peace! Please!”
It goes in one ear and comes out the other for her. 

I haven’t had a good sleep for like 10 months, this is only getting worse every day. 

Tl;dr my fiance makes too much noise every morning waking me up out of my sleep, no matter the time (2am, 5am etc)  she’s making all the noise she wants and plays victim whenever we argue about it. ",5,1728564541.0,marriageadvice,21,0.86,False

How often do we think about where our liquid gold comes from or even who picks the beans? The reality is that in our global coffee market child labour can play significant role, especially in countries like Guatemala, which is one of the world's top coffee exporters. (Yi, 2019, para. 2)



Guatemala's coffee bean plantations supply major western coffee moguls such as Starbucks, Nespresso, Dunkin' Donuts, and Kirkland (Yi, 2019, para. 1) These plantations rely on child labour, with some workers only being five years old. (Yi, 2019, para. 4) These children often work 40-hour weeks, picking beans under gruelling conditions for wages “less than £5 a day” (Doward, 2020, para. 3). Children are also alleged to be working with dangerous tools like machetes and handling harmful pesticides (Yi, 2019, para. 4), all in an effort to meet the high global demand for cheap coffee. 



Why does child labour occur? One may ask. My answer to you is Globalisation. The global north's market's demand for low-cost coffee ultimately drives down wages in underdeveloped countries like Guatemala. Families in such locations are so impoverished that even their children must work to survive. Coffee pickers, many who are migrant workers from rural areas, face systemic exploitation, low pay, and sometimes are even trapped in debt cycles by plantation owners. (Yi, 2019, para. 6) Children, when forced to work, end up missing out on an education, contributing to a vicious cycle of poverty.



Companies Such as Starbucks and Nespresso following accusations claim to follow ethical guidelines and sourcing practices, but it's all a farce. Reports have shown that child labour is still very much present in their global coffee bean supply chains. If we really want to put an end to child labour, We must demand better from our global coffee companies. We need to be pushing for stricter enforcement of labour laws and supporting Fair Trade and ethically sourced coffee. We as a society must stop profiting at the expense of children!

1g0hvuq,https://actipedia.org/project/white-bikes,White Take Out / Take Away,"It’s incredible to think of the great garbage patch floating out in the ocean, making homes and hazards for ocean critters and slowly raining microplastic bits into our food supply, ocean sentiment and who knows where else. Also incredible are the conversations about ‘cleanup’ without any dialogue about how to stem or stop contributing to the mass in the first place. Enter: ‘white takeout’ : a mashup of the Amsterdam white bike project and the evidence that standardized lids facilitated trading (and community) in ancient times.
Imagine a world where kitchens store a number of standardized white food storage devices. Let’s say, just hypothetically, 3 types of transportable white cups (like the popular Stanley and Yeti products, one for smaller, medium and giant beverages each) with the same mouth size for interchangeable lids. And similar bowls for snacks and meals, also, standardized and with lids. And 5 types of reusable, stackable and interlocking (2 can fit on the top of 1, and/or 2 tall are the same height as another talker option) stainless steel white boxes for carrying takeout or food storage. Maybe they work in the oven so food can easily and safely be reheated. 
Then picture what a life with these items might look like. Walking into a coffee shop, maybe a long drive or walk ahead of you, at the counter you receive the coffee in a sterilized ‘white’ cup, rather than paper cup. Your lunch sandwich and pastry are packed into ‘white boxes’ and separated with a ‘white napkin’ of beeswax cloth. You grab a set of ‘white utensils’ in case you need them for the sandwich and hit the road. Later that day, you pick up your mail and leave everything except the white cup in a box by the mailbox. Those will be collected for cleaning and recirculation at the end of each week. The cup is washed and used for evening tea with friends. That cup goes on to float around the kitchen for a few weeks before it ends up back in the car one morning for a road trip. At lunch, you order a drink, which arrives in a white cup, but don’t finish it. So you take it to your car and leave the one that was in your kitchen the past few weeks for the restaurant to sanitize and recirculate. 
Obviously to execute something of this magnitude would require that we work together to create standards and a system that benefits everyone, outside of the normal parameters of capitalism. Which I know to be possible because I see examples of this sort of cooperation everywhere: city streets, public utilities, libraries, fire departments, money, for example. 
We would need an open source design, one that is not constrained by patents so many companies could fabricate these same products. The government would, at minimum, need to monitor use, maintain the standardized system, project need and replace damaged pieces occasionally. ",1,1728564110.0,idea_menagerie,0,1.0,False
1g0hvqa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g0hvqa,Effective old-school treatment ,"I just experienced my first bout of severe constipation, and after slight (but not enough) progress with an enema and a visit to the ER (not helpful), I resorted to magnesium citrate which eventually produced the intended effect, but it needed assistance to ""finish the job.""

Enter the old-school constipation treatment: cold prune juice followed by hot black coffee. My dad told me about this potion, which he got from my great grandfather, who worked for the railroad in Baltimore WAY back in the day, an absolute legend.

In short, this worked to get me to the finish line.

Chug the prune juice first (the cold makes it easier to drink, I think) then the black coffee right after, as quickly as possible given that it's hot (I took a series of sips).

To be clear, I had already had a dose of magnesium citrate, which had finally begun to ""break things up"" almost 5-6 hours after initially taking it. But as things began to clear out, the movements started to space out; I felt like I was waiting longer and longer between movements, and I really wanted to wrap it up. Enter the magical prune juice coffee combo. 💥 Is accurate.

The only downside is that it keeps going for a bit. I'm almost 12 hours past the ""final hurdle,"" and I'm still passing lots of liquid, likely the combined effects of magnesium citrate and the prune juice. Stings a bit if you're torn up.

The upside is that you can easily use this in combination with any other treatment since it's not medical/chemical. If you're stuck or struggling, I highly recommend!",3,1728564100.0,Constipation,1,1.0,False

1g0hv21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Actuallylesbian/comments/1g0hv21/i_need_advice_about_a_dating_app_situation/,I need advice about a dating app situation,"Ok, so I'm a 21 year old lesbian, and haven't dated in quite a while (though that's beside the point, just thought it might be somehow relevant). A few days ago a fellow lesbian I was friends with in high school and a bit after that but who I fell out of regular contact with like 2 years ago, liked me on a lesbian dating app, and since they were someone I'd always been physically attracted to but didn't see as a potential partner at the time, and the fact that I'd always really enjoyed their company, I decided I'd quite like to try dating them, and liked them back. I assumed that since they liked me on a dating app, despite having multiple other ways of contacting each other (we have brief conversations on instagram messages a couple times a year, the last being in May this year), they were probably interested in more than just reconnecting as friends.

I left it a day, and they ended up messaging first, saying ""LIZZIE BAEEEE I HAVENT TALKED TO YOU IN SO LONG"" and I replied ""Yes omg it feels like forever"" then ""also omg you look really good"", trying to be a bit flirty but not go too far. However, they replied ""thank youuuu"" then ""love the fringe gorgeous"" (I have a much nicer hairstyle than last time we hung out irl lol) but to me that just reads as friendly. We then chatted a bit about hairdressers briefly, and I messaged them a day later saying ""Hey, I'd love to see you, do you want to go out for coffee or drinks sometime soon"" (again, trying to make it sound like I was wanting a date without being explicit about it) but they replied ""yeah ofc id love a catch up ill need ot check my rota when im in work tomorrow"" and that has kinda killed my hope, honestly. The ""gorgeous"" message already struck me as friendly in tone, and this one even more so, as I personally wouldn't call a date, even with someone I used to be close with, a ""catch up"".

My friends say I'm being too hasty in jumping to this conclusion, but I can tell they're feeling more pessimistic now too. My counsellor said she really can't tell when I showed her the messages, and that she would personally not call a friend ""gorgeous"" or like someone on a dating app if she wasn't interested in dating and had other ways to contact them, but she's obviously of an older generation so things are probably different for people her age.

But I know the ""useless lesbian"" stereotype has a big grain of truth to it, and I probably have BPD (getting assessed in a couple of weeks), so maybe I'm wrong. What do you guys think? Should I give up? Does it seem likely they're just looking for friendship? Should I just go and see them and see what the vibe is, or should I ask them beforehand to clarify if they're looking for friendship or dating? (I don't want to do the last one if I can avoid it bc I'm already really upset and I feel like it's unlikely they want to date so I don't want to get hurt by rejection anymore than I already have).

Sarah and I were spending most of our time together. We had become best friends, and way faster than either of us had expected. She brought me over to meet her mom, who basically became the mom I never had. My relationship with my parents was not great. I had not spoken to either of them in years. But her mom welcomed me with open arms. She always had me over for dinner and insisted that I come over for holidays and other gatherings. She treated me like a son, and I can honestly say that I loved her. 

Because of my time with Sarah, and the regular therapy I was attending, I was starting to notice a difference in my emotions. I was feeling a lot more stable. I didn’t immediately go to negative thoughts anymore. I got more comfortable in social settings. She even invited me to meet several of her friends, and they welcomed me into their friend group right away. I was starting to feel more confident and was starting to see some value in myself, but there was still a long way to go. 

About 8 months into hanging out we were on a camping trip with some friends. It was dark and we were sitting around the fire. Sarah and I, since we had become so close, did occasionally have cute little physical contact moments, that at the time I thought they were innocent. I still thought she was out of my league, so I never tried anything. And since she never approached me, I took that as validation that she was not interested in me that way. But while we were sitting around the fire, she moved closer to me and put her head on my shoulder. It was at this moment that I knew I was in trouble. I had come to fall in love with her. I sat by the fire smiling, but was screaming in my head. “What are you doing!! She is your best friend. You can’t be in love with her”. I sat on those feelings for maybe a week or so before I decided that it was best to pack them up and throw them in mental storage. 

At about 11 months I was hanging out with some new friends I met through Sarah named Mark and Danielle. They had been together for nearly 10 years, but were not married and had no kids. They were really interesting people and very down to earth. They had become the people I grew closest to out of all of Sarah’s friends. Danielle had been one of Sarah’s oldest and closest friends. Now one night the three of us are sitting in their garage, and out of nowhere Mark looks at me and says “You’re in love with Sarah, aren’t you?” Danielle looked at me smiling. I was a little shocked that they just asked me point blank. I stumbled over my words a bit, but I denied that I did. They both just stared at me with looks that said they weren’t buying it. I denied it again, but they just kept staring. Finally I sighed and said “ is it that obvious?” They said “only when you look at her.” My head fell into my hands. I was so embarrassed. They asked why I hadn’t asked her out yet. And I told them because I thought she was way out of my league. That we were best friends, and I accepted that was as far as it would go. Danielle, again point blank, just said “you know she is crazy about you too, right?” I didn’t believe her. I said she was crazy for even thinking that. While I had become more confident in the last several months, I was still working through some things. Mark chimed in and said “seriously. She is really into you. You haven’t noticed the way she looks at you?” I said “yeah, as a friend”. They both groaned. They told me that I should shoot my shot. That they guaranteed that she would say yes if I asked her out. I told them I would think about it. And I did. I spent the next two weeks with only that on my mind. I even hung out with Sarah less those two weeks because I needed to sort out my thoughts and feelings.

Finally I made a decision, I was going to ask her out. Mark and Danielle were good people, why would they lie to me? I had not seen or talked to Sarah in 4 days, which was weird for us. But I texted her and asked her if she wanted to meet up. She agreed immediately. We met up at that local cafe again. We were sitting and talking. Me with a lead ball in my throat and a million butterflies in my stomach. I couldn’t stop fidgeting. I was so nervous. Obviously Sarah could see something was up, and asked if there was something wrong. I didn’t answer for a second, then looked at her and said that I had something on my mind. Something that had been bothering me for a couple weeks now. And I needed an answer. She looked at me strangely but asked what I needed to know. I hesitated for a moment, but then I just came out and said it. I asked her out. I have never seen a smile so big. She raised her fists and said “finally!!!”. I must have looked shocked, because she giggled when she looked at me and said she had been waiting for me to do that for forever. I asked her if she was so interested, why didn’t she approach me. She said that she knew that I was hesitant to date because of my BPD. So she wanted to respect that. But as time went on she saw me becoming healthier and more stable. And it was then that she hoped I would be ready to ask her out. But I never did, so she thought I just still wasn’t ready. She wanted the ball in my court so that way I could date when I actually felt ready for it. I was so confused. Not by what she said, that made sense, and I thought it was sweet. I was confused because I never in a million years would have thought she would be interested in me like that. She reached out and grabbed my hands with hers, stared right into my eyes and said that she would love to go out with me. I was still confused, but it was a happy confusion. I thought hey it might not make sense, but she likes me, and that’s what matters. So we started dating. 

Okay, now fast forward to a little over a year later. Sarah was still technically living with her mom, but she basically lived with me. I had started to notice that Sarah was acting a bit off recently. I first noticed because she had trouble keeping eye contact, and she never had a problem doing that. I still had problems with overthinking things so I figured I was just being paranoid for no reason and brushed it off. But then she started to talk less, sat a bit further away on the couch. While we usually had sex about 5 times a week, that had dropped to pretty much nothing. And she just kind of had this look of guilt in her eyes. I tried bringing it up, but she said it was nothing and went back to playing candy crush. I could tell something was wrong. A couple days later we were in bed when I turned to her and just asked, are you cheating on me? For a second her eyes got so wide! But as she turned to look at me her face contorted into an almost insulted look. She said she couldn’t even believe I was asking her that. I said that I noticed her behavior lately and I could tell something was wrong. She again said it was nothing, and that I was probably overthinking things like I had a habit of doing. This got under my skin a bit. I told her to cut the shit and tell me what was going on. I told her I saw how scared she looked when I asked her, which to me was an admission of guilt. She started to stammer but she denied it again. I just got out of bed and told her this is her last chance to come clean. If she didn’t then I would just end the relationship right now. She broke down and started to cry. I had expected this. She said she was so sorry. That it only happened once a couple of weeks ago. Which added up because that’s when her behavior started to change. She said she didn’t know why she did it. That it was a mistake and she was so sorry. I asked who it was, and she said it was our friend Josh. 

Now I never really liked Josh. Sarah was good friends with his wife Stacy, so in order to hangout with her, we also had to with Josh. He was cocky, brash and kind of a bully. He really bothered me. So when Sarah said it was him, I was in shock. I asked her why him of all people! I told her she even hated him, so why? She couldn’t give me a reason. She said she didn’t know how or why it even happened. I told her she needed to leave. She had a couple minutes to get her bags packed and out of my apartment. She begged me not to do this. To just talk to her, but I said no. She lost any right to a conversation about us the moment you slept with someone else. She had nothing to say to this. So she just continued to cry and pack a couple bags. When she reached the door I told her to stop, and sit on the couch. She looked confused, but she did. I told her to wait a minute. I went into my room and grabbed a decently sized box. I came out and put the box on the coffee table. Sarah obviously was wondering what the box was about, but she didn’t ask. I asked her if this had anything to do with our conversation about marriage last month? 

See, I am not really one for marriage. My parents were divorced and I know how messy it can be. And while I’m not a pessimist, I understand that the reality is that no couple is guaranteed to stay together forever. So why get married if by chance we end up splitting up one day. Wouldn’t it be easier to just break up than go through a divorce. Sarah did want to get married one day. She said she understood my position, but she loved the idea of two people enjoying a celebration to share their love with their closest friends and family. That to get married was the greatest display of two peoples' love. We talked for a while just bouncing ideas and thoughts off each other. We normally had great communication. We tried our best to not get into arguments, and instead try to understand where each person was coming from, and would figure out a compromise that worked for us both. That’s not to say that we didn’t have our arguments. Sometimes, those just can’t be avoided. So I told her that while I was not the biggest fan of marriage, I was still open to the idea and would think about it. 

So, I asked Sarah if it had anything to do with our talk about marriage last month, and she said that could have been a contributing factor. She just felt disappointed that we didn’t share the same feelings on marriage. She started to question if this was actually going to go anywhere, and it made her start to feel bad and unwanted. I told her that I was open to the idea, and would think about it. So why did it seem like she took my response as a direct no? She said she didn’t know. For some reason she just couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t going to change my feelings on the matter.

It was at this time I slid the box over to her. She just looked at me and I told her to open it. She did and inside was another box. Again she looked at me confused, then pulled out that box and opened it. There was another box. It was basically a nesting dolls box. Sarah had some weird love of nesting dolls, I never understood it, but it was her thing. She did this about three more times until she opened the last box, and inside was a jewelry box. She dropped it on the table and whipped her head around to face me, all wide eyed and in utter disbelief. I told her that I had thought about it and came to a decision. That it didn’t matter how I spent the rest of my life with her, just that I did. And if marriage was really important to her, I would step out of my comfort zone to make her happy. Tears welled up in her eyes even more. She started crying even harder now. I said ""I had planned on marrying you, but you ruined that. Your doubts and lack of trust has now ruined our future together"". I wanted her to feel the same hurt she made me feel. So I had decided that before she left, what better way to jab the dagger in than to show her that I had planned on giving her exactly what she wanted. I got up from the couch, went to the door, opened it and told her to get out. Still crying, she slowly got up, and walked out of my apartment, defeated. I made sure to slam the door behind her and locked it.  Right after she left I called Stacy and told her what Sarah and her husband had done. Stacy was pissed. She had suspected that Josh had been cheating on her for a while now. I told her then Sarah might not have been the only one then as this just happened a couple weeks ago. She just screamed and hung up the phone. 

A little while later Sarah’s mom called me asking what happened. She said Sarah came home and just went straight to her room crying. And how she has just been sobbing nonstop. I told her about how Sarah had cheated on me. Her mom didn’t believe me. I told her how I confronted Sarah tonight about it. It took some work, but I got her to admit to it. Her mom asked me, ""What about the proposal?"" I had made her mom aware of what I had planned on doing. She even helped me pick out the ring. I told her there was no longer a proposal. I told her that I told Sarah about the proposal, just so she knew what she lost. Her mom was upset, but definitely not with me. She said that she loves me and understands my decision. That it will be a shame to no longer see me coming over for dinner and spending time with the family. I said I would miss her too and that I loved her. I hung up and tried to go to sleep. 

A couple weeks later her mom called me again and said that Sarah was doing terribly. She wouldn’t eat, she couldn’t sleep. She just laid in bed all day crying. She had gotten fired from her job for not showing up. That her life was a mess because of what she had done, and wanted to know if I would be willing to talk to her. She said Sarah didn’t know that she was calling, so whatever my decision, it would stay between the two of us. Now, I won’t lie, it broke my heart to hear all that. There was still part of me that would always love her. I mean, I really felt like she saved my life. If I had never met her, I might never have become the healthy person I was today. I told her mom that while that was really sad to hear, I just couldn’t face her. Her mom said she understood. I did say to her though that I had a message for Sarah. I told her that if she really does care about me, then for me, she should eat, sleep and start prioritizing her own personal health. Her mother said that I was a good man and that she will miss me. We said our goodbyes and that was it. They never reached out after that. ",6,1728563725.0,stories,0,0.87,False

1g0hldv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1g0hldv/minimalist_coffee_tables_simple_designs_for/,Minimalist Coffee Tables: Simple Designs for Elegant Spaces,"In the world of interior design, minimalist coffee tables have become a staple for those looking to create elegant, uncluttered living spaces. A well-chosen coffee table can tie together a room’s aesthetic, adding both style and functionality. The beauty of minimalist coffee tables lies in their simplicity, clean lines, and ability to fit seamlessly into any decor style. Whether you prefer natural materials like a [rattan coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/coffee-tables), a sleek [black coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/lucas-black-coffee-table), or a chic [metal table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/coffee-tables), minimalist designs can elevate your space with ease.

**1. Why Choose Minimalist Coffee Tables?**

Minimalist coffee tables are perfect for those who value simplicity and elegance. These tables focus on form and function, offering a clean and uncluttered look while providing essential functionality. The key characteristics of minimalist designs include:

**Simplicity:** Minimalist coffee tables avoid excessive decoration and focus on clean, sleek lines.

**Neutral colors:** Shades like black, white, or natural wood tones dominate, allowing the table to blend seamlessly with other furniture.

**Functionality:** Beyond aesthetics, minimalist coffee tables often offer clever storage solutions or multi-functionality.

Choosing a minimalist coffee table helps create a sense of calm and order in your living room, allowing the room’s other features, such as a statement rug or a cozy sofa, to shine.

**2. Rattan Coffee Table: Bringing Natural Warmth**

For those who love a touch of nature in their homes, a rattan coffee table is a fantastic option. Rattan, a natural material known for its strength and flexibility, adds a warm, organic feel to any space. It is ideal for bohemian, coastal, or Scandinavian interiors where the focus is on creating relaxed, natural spaces.

**Light and airy design:** The woven texture of rattan offers a light, breathable look, making it perfect for minimalist spaces that need a touch of nature without overwhelming the room.

**Versatile pairing:** Rattan tables can be paired with neutral or earthy tones for a harmonious look, or you can mix them with modern materials like glass or metal to create a beautiful contrast.

A minimalist rattan coffee table works especially well in living rooms with lots of natural light, creating an inviting space that feels fresh and breezy.

**3. Black Coffee Table: Bold Simplicity**

A black coffee table is the epitome of minimalist elegance. The deep, rich color instantly adds a modern and sophisticated vibe to any space while still maintaining a sense of simplicity.

**Timeless appeal:** Black is a classic color that never goes out of style, making it a perfect choice for those looking to create a sleek, contemporary look.

**Contrast and focus:** A black table can serve as a bold focal point in a light or neutral-colored room, adding contrast and making the entire space feel more defined.

**Variety of styles:** Whether you prefer a glossy lacquer finish for a modern touch or a matte black surface for understated elegance, a black coffee table can be adapted to fit various minimalist designs.

This type of coffee table pairs well with metallic accents, light upholstery, or wooden floors, creating a striking yet balanced aesthetic.

**4. Metal Coffee Table: Sleek and Modern**

For those looking for a modern, industrial edge, a metal table is the perfect minimalist coffee table option. Metal tables exude a sleek, urban vibe, often associated with modern and industrial decor styles.

**Durability and practicality:** Metal tables are highly durable, making them a great option for homes with busy living rooms or families.

**Streamlined design:** With their clean lines and minimal detailing, metal coffee tables fit seamlessly into minimalist living spaces, offering both form and function.

**Mixed materials:** Metal tables often incorporate other materials such as glass or wood, giving you a variety of design options. For instance, a metal frame with a wooden or glass top adds texture and visual interest while keeping the overall design simple.

A metal table pairs perfectly with neutral color schemes and can be softened by pairing it with plush textiles like throws and cushions for a cozy touch.

**5. How to Choose the Right Minimalist Coffee Table**

When selecting a minimalist coffee table, it’s important to consider both style and practicality. Here are a few tips to guide your decision:

**Size and scale:** Choose a table that is proportionate to your seating area. In minimalist spaces, less is more, so avoid oversized coffee tables that may clutter the room.

**Material:** Depending on your aesthetic, you can choose between natural materials like rattan, bold options like a black coffee table, or modern designs like a metal table. Consider the existing furniture and decor in your space to find the perfect match.

**Functionality:** Look for tables with additional features such as storage shelves or a design that allows for easy movement, especially if you have a smaller living space.

**Conclusion**

Minimalist coffee tables are a perfect choice for those looking to create elegant, serene spaces. Whether you opt for a warm rattan coffee table, a striking black coffee table, or a sleek metal table, these simple designs can anchor your living room while adding sophistication and functionality. By focusing on clean lines, neutral colors, and practical design, a minimalist coffee table will enhance your home without overwhelming the space.",1,1728563158.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

Goal is to lose weight.

When I read up on the diet my understanding is you need to fast for 12 hours for your body to burn up all the calories you ate and any time fasting after that your body is running on fat stores? Could definitely be wrong but that’s how I understood it. 

My confusion though is why would say consuming 10 calories completely ruin the diet because wouldn’t the time my body would take to burn those 10 calories off and go back to fat stores be very very minimal?

The reason why I ask is cause my job requires to be on my feet working at 5:30 in the morning. I can’t drink black coffee on the job and normally don’t wake up in enough time to sit down and enjoy a cup. So I normally resort to buying an energy drink. But I don’t buy stuff like monster/red bull. I’ve been getting those Reign plant based energy drinks. The nutrition label says it has 10 calories, 0 sugars, 3g carbs and a bit of sodium. The ingredients label didn’t look like they had any sugar supplements either. So would this drink kill a fast? I can go without it….

As I am writing from an airport today I'll cut straight to the chase in the preamble before we get to our usual: yesterday handed us our golden accumulation opportunity on the Stonk. The charts couldn't've looked any more bullish if someone hung a sign on them that said 'buy me.' This does not deviate from what I've been talking about all week and what I've been forecasting since September 19 - the last time we had just seen this exact pattern of reversal preparation emerge. Let's take a look!

**Price Movement Recap**

[10\/9 Trading Day 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/4lmcodwl1xtd1.png?width=1215&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cebe72fa8062a5316c04c8de7d501501993cf98)

Yesterday's price action was conspicuously quiet. The price went nowhere. Literally nowhere. We actually logged a \*white candle\* on the daily chart, meaning our opening and closing prices were exactly the same - $20.50. Overall volume fell 3.9mil shares traded on the day - our lowest volume since late August - and options flows were slanted bearish once more overall on the day, but only by $500k given our low volume over all. The effect of this was an IV killshot, bleeding almost seven (7) full percentage points - from \~86.5% to \~79.9% - on the day from open to our intraday low above at $20.30. This was so clearly a buy signal that savvy options traders jumped on the opportunity to build start building long positions and closing short positions, as seen from our large volume uptick and price run up to $20.50 into the close.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

We got some bullish signals in the OI layout yesterday. Take a look:

[10\/11 OI Changes 10\/9-10\/10](https://preview.redd.it/ylwkrd8r5xtd1.png?width=1850&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ec7550c677ca42f2bd9e7b5f57259a07b22b3a6)

No, I'm not talking about those new calls alone at $21 and $22 on the left. I'm talking about all those puts coming off the board on the right. This is Put holders taking profits and bailing OUT of their bearish trades into today's trading.

[10\/18 OPEX Changes 10\/9-10\/10](https://preview.redd.it/vcp172wn6xtd1.png?width=1850&format=png&auto=webp&s=50d76358c169337d6328ba07dc5d600b9376a7cb)

At the same time for next week, we had a sizable amount of new OI come in at $20 which shifts MM gamma exposure at that strike decidedly positive, stabilizing it as we come out of this week's expiry. In fact, next week even above $19 our MM Gamma Exposure ratios are net positive and decidedly volatility suppressant.

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/yrln6b1z3xtd1.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=b940f1b2c27a39a126f79ed994b2cca23a9768b9

As I mentioned earlier in the week, traders and institutions have been piling up call gamma on our $20 and $20.50 positions. These positions have shifted increasingly volatility suppressant and $21 has transformed from a net negative into a net positive gamma position. There is a low probability of any significant downward volatility and the stock is set up to reverse to the upside - possibly riding an end of the week gamma ramp up through $22 if it can attract enough call buyers before cooling off into the $21-$21.50 range. The best time to fire something off like this for the most rapid delta appreciation is Friday, but the stock has sold off so hard at the same time that volume has continued to dry up that a two-part reversal to $22 starting today isn't out of the question, especially if institutions want to use the CPI print as an excuse of some kind to pump w/e they feel like.

RSI, IV, volume all approaching 2-month lows. Doodle doodling. Gotta catch a flight. You know the deal.

**IV Trends**

As I indicated above, our price action yesterday bled our IV values back down sub 80% for a brief moment (before the options market bought the IV back up into the close). I had the opportunity to exchange some messages with user TodoPT who shared the following graphic with me:

https://preview.redd.it/p0cebqsq7xtd1.png?width=912&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c2383c5aa46f94200b79d0301e7d88b30e64e64

This was before we slumped down the last few percentage points on the day. This graphic demonstrates the IV trend I've been talking about over the last few days, namely that we are getting down to the absolute lows we see on GME. IV levels are approaching unprecedented levels of value as far as IV goes.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

As I mentioned, GME is basically set up to reverse up to $22 in the short term essentially now and traders look like they are beginning to adjust their bets accordingly. I myself have personally been entering into $20 Jan 2025 Calls and increasing my share position all throughout this week in anticipation not only of our near-term reversal, but of the reversal of our larger Post-May bearish trend out of October OPEX. While nothing is certain and I could certainly be early here, these signals give me enough confidence as an investor that GME is showing uncommon value at our current price point and IV levels. Please don't take this as an exhortation to go bet your life savings on GME calls! Please please please manage your risk. As for me, I like the stock.

Good luck out there!

Cheers

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I never hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.",395,1728563080.0,Superstonk,32,0.92,False
1g0hk9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1g0hk9w/i_27f_dont_know_if_i_want_to_be_with_my_boyfriend/,I 27f don’t know if I want to be with my boyfriend anymore 32m? ,"I’m really confused about my relationship. My boyfriend is very loving & caring but he’s also super insecure & there is a language barrier so I feel like it’s hard to explain or get him to understand how I feel sometimes. Ive not been in a proper relationship before, my first relationship when I was 16 was for 2 years and was emotionally, verbally and sometimes physically abusive. Every guy I’ve had a situationship with since then has ended in heartbreak. I’ve grown to be a very independent person, this is mostly because of my upbringing and having to look after my family & because I just don’t have time for bullshit anymore, drama is not something I want to be a part of.
So here’s a few reasons why I’m confused about my relationship: He constantly needs reassurance that our relationship is okay, if we have a disagreement or argument of any sort he acts like it’s the end of the relationship & needs some kind of summary to the argument to agree that we are okay when they’re not even real arguments, just small things. He doesn’t really respect my personal space. I’m not an overly affectionate person but he is, I do try my best to be more affectionate with him and meet him half way but it’s never enough for him. Like I don’t think we need to be constantly cuddling or touching each other. The other day I came home from work, I’d been working long hours all week & was absolutely exhausted. I walked in the door, said hello, he asked what was wrong, I said I was just super exhausted. Before I had even put my bag or anything down he’s practically standing on top of me asking for a hug, so I gave him one, I would have anyways but then I said I was going to shower because I knew if I sat down I wouldn’t get back up. After my shower I sat on the lounge & he started on me, saying I didn’t match his energy when I came home & why does my mood affect how I am with him. I was not rude to him in any way whatsoever but I told him we have completely different days before we come home to each other & I’m super tired & my home is my safe, comfortable space so I shouldn’t have to fake my emotions or mood when I wasn’t doing anything specific to hurt or upset him in any way. I said I was so tired and just wanted to sit down and relax, I was speaking to him like normal & it just felt like such an unnecessary argument after an already long, hard day. 
He also wants to have sex like every single day & then if I don’t finish, which is rare if I do he gets upset & says he mustn’t be good enough in bed & that I won’t want to have sex with him if I don’t get to finish when we do. I’ve told him numerous times that I’m satisfied with our sex even if I don’t finish because it’s very hard for me. But him acting like this every time we have sex makes me not want to have sex with him & then I’ve also asked him not to finish in me because I don’t like the feeling of it afterwards and the clean up of it but 8/10 times he still does & then gets upset that I don’t stay to cuddle for more than 10 minutes after because I want to go to the bathroom and clean myself up. 
There’s also the fact that he is on my back about what I eat, like it has to be healthy all the time. If I make an easy dinner then it’s like I don’t care about him & im like what? He cooks too but sometimes I just want to eat something easy & chill out, like a toasted sandwich or something. 
Lastly & most recently I borrowed some money off him to go have dinner & drinks with friends who I haven’t seen in over 6 months & told him I’d give it back on Monday when I get paid, he agreed & gave me to money. The next day he lectured me about money & told me if I can’t afford to do that then I shouldn’t & should spend my money on better things. I asked why he gave it to me if he felt that way & could have just said no. He said he wanted me to go out & have a good time. I said I don’t understand why you would give it to me if he was just going to lecture me about money after I’d spent it & that I wouldnt ask him again, I turned into this big thing. Like I don’t care if he says no to me, it’s his money & id rather him say no then lecture me about it later. Mind you, this man lives in my house for practically nothing & I’d spent my going out money on a coffee maker for him he wanted asap for his mornings before work which he did tell me he’d pay me back for but when I gave it to him said it was such a lovely gift & thanked me for it but that was it. 
There’s more stuff but I feel like this is already too long. I’m trying to get in to see a psychologist but it’s really hard atm as I’m working 2 jobs. I’m just so confused & I don’t know if I’m being super up tight. Like I said he’s very loving & caring but I just don’t know if I can see myself marrying this man anymore. Oh, we’ve been together for like 6 months. So idk if I’m still just learning to ropes of the relationship. I’m scared to break up with him incase it’s the wrong choice & I’m scared of breaking his heart. He also does not trust me & accuses me of lying all the time & then blames his actions on his past relationships & insecurities. I feel like that’s not fair on me because I’m not a liar & I HATE being accused of something I haven’t or would not do. So please, if anyone has any advice, would be very much appreciated!

Setting out on a little adventure sounded fun and I had never dispersed camped at this particular state park.  I left work at 11 on Saturday (yeah, lame), got home, did a few chores then packed up the bike and left home a little after 2 with a nice tailwind.   This particular route covers 30 miles of roads I have ridden many times previously, but riding a packed up bike knowing you're disappearing into the woods for the night makes them hit different.  I was overbiking for most of the route pushing 2.6's on paved paths and smooth tarmac but it didn't matter, I was cruising on cloud nine.  I didn't find any amazing spots this time around and I didn't put in crazy miles but I wasn't complaining.  I sat in the sun, cooked ramen, ate beef jerky, stared at bugs, took photos, read a little and just enjoyed the peace and quiet.  Passed out early and was woken by the sound of coyotes yipping and howling around 12 AM near my tent, was pretty neat.  I woke up again around 2:30 to pee and immediately noticed an off smelling burning smell (meth?) upwind of me, I held my pee until I woke again around 6 and the smell was gone.  Woke up, made coffee, ate granolas bars, hiked around a bit, packed up the bike, took some more photos and then took off into another tailwind that took me home.  Home by noon to hang with the family and getting ready for the next week.  It was just what I needed.",54,1728562722.0,bikepacking,0,0.99,False

Here are some books that **have come close** that I loved ([here are all the cozy books](https://tayarunsandreads.com/tag/cozy-mystery/) I've reviewed if that helps with suggestions, but probably too much work to click over..):

* Thursday Murder Club series
* Stephanie Plum series
* Sunshine Vicram series (A Bad Day for Sunshine)
   * I did[ review this series](https://tayarunsandreads.com/book-review-a-bad-day-for-sunshine-by-darynda-jones-sunshine-vicram-trilogy-review-spoilers/) if you're interested
* Miss Fortune series (Lousiana Longshot)
* Dead and Gondola series
* The Maid and The Mystery Guest
* Death on Tap series - loved this, would recommend! Not the exact same vibe I was going for but loved the scenery
* Murder at an Irish Village - loved these, not the same vibe either, but still really liked
* Buried in a Good Book series
* Beacon Bakeshop series
* Lakeside Mystery series

Here are others I've read thinking they might get that same vibes I was craving.. I liked them! Just not loved.

* Arsenic and Adobo - ChatGPT was adamant about this being similar when I asked it the same prompt, it was good! Just not the same
* A for Aunties - again, fun! But not quite there
* Sunset Years of Agnes Sharp
* Chocolate Chip Cookie Murder - the Joanne Fluke books - these were good but not quite there
* Agatha Raisin series - still reading all these in the series but not the same vibe at all
* Marlow Club Murders - these were good, again, not quite as good as the Thursday Murder Club
* Death by Coffee series - still reading them, just not it
