1paeumz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1paeumz/i_finally_built_an_expense_tracker_that_actually/,I finally built an expense tracker that actually understands receipts and voice notes — would love your feedback,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been using expense trackers for years, but I always had the same problems:  
Typing every transaction manually is annoying, receipt scanners misread items, and most apps feel bloated or confusing.

So I built my own app — **Smart Expense** — and I’d love honest feedback from you all.

# What makes it different

* **AI-powered scanning**: Take a picture of any receipt, and the app extracts every item, amount, and category automatically. No manual editing needed.
* **Voice-to-expense**: You can literally say: *“coffee 18 AED”* and it adds it instantly.
* **Super clean UI**: Minimal, simple, and fast—no ads, no popups.
* **Smart insights**: The app highlights where your money is going and gives suggestions on how to improve spending habits.
* **PDF & CSV export**: One tap to download your full monthly report.

# Why I’m posting

I built this app as a solo developer, and I’m trying to make it genuinely useful—not just another boring budget app. I’d love:

* Feature suggestions
* UI/UX feedback
* Bugs you might spot
* Ideas to make the AI smarter

If you want to try it:

Should I enjoy her generosity or insist on paying to support her business?","My friend recently opened her own hair salon, and I brought her a coffee machine as a gift for her grand opening. She was genuinely happy, and as a thank-you, she personally gave me a full hand-care and manicure service completely for free.

To be honest, I felt a bit uncomfortable. I am not very good at accepting free favors, especially when it comes to a friend’s new business. But since she had already insisted and was sitting right in front of me, I did not know how to politely turn her down. Watching her focus so carefully on every step of the service made me feel both grateful and heavy-hearted at the same time.

Before I left, I quietly checked the price of the service.  
The next day, when she was not around, I went back to the salon and told the staff, “I think the service yesterday was charged incorrectly. Could you ring it up for me again?” I paid the full amount. My friend never found out.

At that moment, I felt a sense of peace. I knew I had respected her work and supported her business in the way that aligns with my values.

For me, this became a tug-of-war between enjoying a friend’s kindness in the moment and staying true to what I believe in: supporting her honestly and not letting her labor become invisible just because we are close.

Now I am torn between two choices:

A. Accept her free services. It is her genuine joy to treat me, and it is okay to enjoy the warmth and kindness between friends.

B. Pay in full, whether openly or quietly. It shows respect for her work and truly supports her new business.",0,1764496865.0,PickAorB,6,0.5,False

1paenrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1paenrc/thoughts_past_year_one/,Thoughts past year one...,"It's been almost one year and three months since you left.

I'm happy to tell you that I am surviving. A lot of things have changed since you left. I have friends now, so I get to go out when I have the chance. They are seniors too, and I am the baby, so they take care of me—especially Sis Merce. She always asks how I’m doing and is the one who keeps the group together. Chewy is more clingy now; she usually sleeps beside me in bed, especially when it's cold.

I can’t promise, though, that I won’t cry anymore. I didn’t lose you once—I lose you every single day. One time I asked you, “What would I do without you?” and you replied, “Move on.” And I struggle living my life now without you, knowing that we can’t do our plans anymore. Even if my heart aches every day, it’s okay. It reminds me of how much we loved each other and that you will always be here. I will always have you in my heart.

They told me that work would help keep my mind off thinking of you so much. But lately, work has gotten too overwhelming, and my body couldn’t take it anymore, so I got sick. (Yes, I’m really sorry I took that additional work even when you didn’t agree.) After being pinned down for a day, I couldn’t help but go out of the house. I wanted to visit you, but I couldn’t, because I wasn’t able to book a car because of the rain. So I ended up in this coffee shop near our place.

Earlier in the day, I felt so bad for myself—feeling alone, feeling like no one would want someone with “baggage.” But then I remembered you. Even if you didn’t say it, I knew you were attracted to me because I was a strong, independent woman. I exuded confidence, especially in that blue dress. You know how I loved traveling, and in a way I regret that we didn’t do it that much in the past few years.

While sitting in this coffee shop, I realized that I want to be that person again—the one you loved. I want to have plans now. I’m thinking of taking a degree in AI or something in tech, or maybe traveling again. Maybe buying an EV (BYD, perhaps?). I realized that you will always be part of those plans because you would have wanted this for me.

About the second chapter… maybe someone will come along. I don’t really know how this will work, but you will always be my husband and my first love. Hopefully, this person will understand my situation, and my love for him will definitely be different—and incomparable—to my love for you. You know the person I’m “crushing” on now, but I don’t know. It seems like I’m the only one sending signals. Anyway, next please. 😁

While I’m here, please guide me every day. I still think of you and what you would do before I make decisions. Even when you’re up there, you still have such a strong impact on me. I will always cherish the love we had and carry it with me every day. Please wait for me up there. I long for the day we meet again. I love you so much, and you will always be in my heart.

1paemv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingGabapentin/comments/1paemv3/did_you_experience_a_nonlinear_withdrawal_timeline/,Did you experience a non-linear withdrawal timeline?,"Coming up on day 7. Jumped from a point where i needed about 600 mg per day to keep me out of withdrawals, but my dependency has ranged from 150 mg to 1200 mg per day for about a year this go round. 

Been dependent on it before as well, and I know that's a factor. 

Another possibly relevant bit, I obsessively followed 'protocol' for maximum bioavailability. 

Always took my gaba before eating anything. 300 mg at a time, followed by another 300 mg 30 mins later with a handful of mixed nuts and something acidic, coffee or carbonated water. Sometimes take naproxen for that lil 10%ish increase or whatever. 

Just trying to communicate that I learned how to get it into my body most effectively for my body, if that makes any sense? Brain is mush at the moment. 

The point of my post is to ask if nonlinear wd timeline is common with gaba. 

I've broken this dependency before, but was on other substances that covered the worst of the symptoms. 

It's very different this go round, and 'the unknown' makes things much more difficult.  

It's 3 am going into my 7th day and I haven't slept in a while. 

It was gnarly days 2 - 5, but it felt like I made it over the hump in a big way. Like, I made it through the worst. 

I'm now feeling extremely NOT GOOD again. 

Is this just how gabapentinoids tend to go? I guess I probably know the answer already, as these things are complicated as hell and VERY rarely a solid linear sort of situation. 

I guess I just needed to vent and seek some common humanity and support. 

I deeply appreciate what gabapentin has done for me, but holy shit, this is wild. 

Side note, as a opiate, benzo, and stim addict it's super weird to be dependant on something but not addicted. I have like 350 x 300mg gaba right in front of me, feel awful, but feel strongly averse to taking any. Bizarre lol",1,1764496681.0,QuittingGabapentin,0,1.0,False

1paej1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/fieldnotesofbecoming/comments/1paej1n/field_note_the_beat_goes_on/,Field Note: The Beat Goes On.,"For the ones still walking when everything else has fallen quiet.

When chaos calls for all to fall
like bad bets on a crooked table,
and silence clocks in
for the night shift,

you stand there
watching the dust come down—
slow,
patient,
like it’s trying on
the whole world
for a winter coat.

It soft-blankets the land
and all the old nouns—
church, bus stop, apartment, bar—
lose their capitalization
and just become
shapes in the gray.

Somewhere a traffic light
hangs on red
for nobody.
A newspaper box
still believes in tomorrow
with its mouth jammed open,
selling headlines to ghosts.

In the rubbled wastes,
held in sunset’s gleaming grasp
like a cigarette ember
cupped from the wind,
he appears.

Not so much a man
as a rumor
the day forgot to swallow.

Boots crunching glass,
he walks
like he’s late
for his own afterlife.

Coat torn,
threadbare at the collar,
smelling of rain
that never arrived,
coffee that cooled
on a table that’s gone,
and the last cheap cologne
of a world that dressed up
for nothing.

His shadow drags behind him
like a reluctant suitcase.
His hands hang loose,
those tired old saints
that once believed
in doorknobs, steering wheels,
and holding other hands
in grocery lines.

Billboards flap above him,
selling vacations
to places that never existed
except in the fever dream
of some ad man
who thought palm trees
could save us.

A child’s plastic ring
gleams in the rubble.
He does not pick it up.
Some devotions
hurt too much to hold.

He keeps walking anyway,
step
after step,
like a stubborn prayer
that forgot
it was never answered.

The air tastes of burnt wiring,
lost arguments,
and that copper-tongued truth
that nothing
ever really belongs to us—
not the cities,
not the people,
not even the skin
we’re wearing.

He stops
on a broken concrete island
in the middle of a dead street,
as if the world
is still divided
into lanes that matter.

Sunset leans in,
sets his edges on fire,
makes a cathedral
out of his ruin,
stained glass
out of his bruises.

He cups his hands
around his mouth,
like every lonely kid
who ever yelled into a canyon
hoping God was an echo,

and lets it fly
through the hollow circuits
of the quiet:

“Take me
as I am.”

The words ripple out,
ride the empty bus routes,
curl into the glove boxes
of abandoned cars,
crawl under crooked doorframes
and fall asleep
next to people
who haven’t decided yet
if they’re still alive.

A stray dog looks up,
ears tilted
like fresh questions.
Far off,
someone buried in drywall and doubt
takes one extra breath
they hadn’t planned on.

When chaos calls
for all to fall,
most do.

But sometimes—
once in a long while—
the universe misfiles a soul,
forgets to tell him
he’s finished,

and you get this:
one dust-crowned fool
walking through the aftermath,
carrying a heart
like a dog-eared paperback,
and a soul still thumbing rides
along an unmarked road,

proving with every
stubborn, echoing step
that the story’s
still being written

in whatever’s left of us
that refuses
to shut up
and lie down.

While you’re copy-pasting between tools, manually routing tasks, and chasing status updates, your competitors are quietly building AI-powered workflows that:

- Cut turnaround times from days to hours  
- Reduce errors from manual handoffs  
- Free up people from repetitive work so they can focus on customers and innovation  

If you don’t move, a few things are likely to happen:

- Your ops costs stay high while pricing pressure keeps rising  
- Your best people spend more time in “busywork mode” than “builder mode”  
- You struggle to scale without just adding more headcount  
- Customers start expecting instant, AI-assisted experiences you can’t deliver

We recently published: **“6 Strategies To Supercharge Your Workflows With AI Tools”**  
https://www.agentixlabs.com/blog/general/6-strategies-to-supercharge-your-workflows-with-ai-tools/

In the article, we break down six practical moves you can start on right now, including:

- Designing an AI-first work environment instead of bolting tools on top of broken processes  
- Building an AI “command center” so agents work together instead of in silos  
- Using privacy-first designs so security and compliance are built in, not bolted on  
- Creating smarter KPIs so you measure real outcomes, not just “AI usage”

If you’re not sure where to start, one low-friction step is to map a single workflow that is:

- High volume  
- Rule-based  
- Painful for your team today  

Then explore how an AI agent could own 70–80% of that flow, with humans handling the exceptions.

At AgentixLabs, we’re helping teams do exactly this—from AI-driven quality checks to AI-powered marketing operations and service workflows. If you want to sanity-check a use case or talk through what an “AI-first workflow” could look like for your org, we’re happy to share ideas and examples.

What’s one workflow in your world that you suspect an AI agent could handle better than a human on their fifth coffee of the day?

Was it a mistake?,"I’m a 23 year old woman and haven’t had any form of traditional social media (instagram, Snapchat, twitter, Facebook, etc.) for over 7 years. I feel proud of my decision in many ways, and I feel mentally healthier than a lot of my peers but socially I wonder if I did a disservice to myself. 

I deleted it primarily because I noticed it was taking time away from things I found more fulfilling like art, music, etc. In many ways, I feel like this decision impacts me positively. For example, I can confidently say I do not struggle with depression or anxiety, I feel content in my life and content in my body for the most part, I rarely compare my life to others lives, I feel happy with my simple life.. but that’s where the problem lies. My life is VERY simple. I work, go to school, but most of my hobbies I do at home. I like to go on longs walks but I don’t honestly enjoy going out that much. I’ve hung out with people, went to parties and found them kind of exhausting or pointless as I honestly didn’t have a good time. I feel happiest being cozy at home, spending time with my boyfriend, and occasionally seeing a close friend and getting coffee. Other close friends I have I talk to primarily over the phone. 

When I look at my life from a standpoint of “am I happy?” The answer is easily yes. But when I see the social media posts my friends show me, I realize how much people my age seem to be doing? Like traveling, going on all these crazy hikes, partying, seemingly constantly being around tons of people, I wonder, did I make the wrong decision? Should I be living that life? I don’t even recognize that people live such exciting lives because I only compare myself to people I actually know: and I know everyone’s struggles, fears, typical daily life, and I don’t feel so strange. Honestly, most of the time I feel like I’m doing well for myself because I feel mentally better. 

But at the SAME time I’m wondering if I socially screwed myself by not engaging because all of it seems so foreign to me? And I feel much less “cool,” everyone seems to have this very curated aesthetic and interesting life, and I worry by not having social media I wasnt pushed to pursue a more .. exciting life?

1paeeo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1paeeo0/emergency_contact/,EMERGENCY CONTACT,"People say everyone handles grief differently.

Lacey handled hers one sip at a time.

At first it was to help her sleep, and then she drank to forget, eventually just to make it through the day.
Being sober meant being alone with her head, and she hated that more than dying.

Even when her doctor said liver failure, she felt nothing. 

She just didn’t care anymore.

But when a match came along, something changed inside her, a feeling she hadn’t expected to ever feel again. Hope.

She didn’t understand it, she just knew she wanted to live.

On the morning of her surgery a nurse checked in, “Your emergency contact is listed as your dad. Is that still correct?”

Lacey knew it wasn’t, but pretending her dad was still here felt nicer than admitting she had no one else. So she left it.

Her recovery went well.

When she got home she threw out the alcohol and vowed she wouldn't touch a drop again. She was determined to be better.

Then after one bad day she reached for her old comfort, and she didn’t even finish the drink before her body collapsed. Everything went dark.

She woke in a hospital room.

“Hey there, you’re awake. How are you feeling?”

A nurse moved over and straightened the blanket.

“You gave us a bit of a scare… especially after everything we did to get you through recovery.”

“A shame… we were all rooting for you.”

Lacey didn't answer, she just nodded. The shame had already hit.

“We called your emergency contact,” the nurse said, placing a file on the table. “He’s been here all night, looking after you. He just popped out for a coffee, he’ll be right back.”

The words slid past her at first.

She was still groggy and half drowning in sedatives and guilt.

Then they circled back.

Emergency contact.

He’s been here all night.

That made no sense. Her dad had been dead for three years.

Lacey’s mouth opened to correct her, but an alarm sounded down the hall and the nurse rushed away before she could get a word out.

For a second Lacey just lay there, trying to make sense of it.

Must have got me confused for someone else, Lacey thought. It has to be a mistake.

She pushed herself up and reached for the folder with unsteady hands. Whether from fear of who had been here all night or because she hadn’t had a drink, she didn’t know.

The intake form sat on top. Her dad’s name filled the Emergency Contact line.

She still knew his number by heart.

And this wasn’t it.

Someone had changed it.

Her hands were shaking too hard to hold the pages anymore. They slid out of her lap and hit the floor.

Before she could pick them up, the curtain moved.

A man stepped inside and pulled it shut again. He looked around his mid 40s, he was neatly dressed and wore the kind of worried, gentle expression people have when visiting a loved one.

He stopped beside her bed. He looked grateful to see her awake.

He bent and picked up the papers for her.

But instead of handing them back, he started reading it. 
Her address, medical history, as though he had every right to see it.

“What the hell are you doing?” Lacey snarled, going to snatch the papers from his hand.

A sharp pain ripped through her stomach and stopped her halfway. She froze, pressing one hand over her scar.

He didn’t even flinch. He just kept reading.

When he got to the relapse note, his expression changed. The caring softness drained from his face.

“I can't believe you drank,” he said, eyes locked on her stomach. “After everything she’s been through. She needs to be safe.”

Lacey stared at him, stunned. “Who the hell are you?”

“I’m your emergency contact,” he said, like she should already know.

He leaned down towards her scar.

“Take better care of her,” he whispered.

His nearness made her skin crawl. She tried to push him away, but her body was still weak, her hand barely moved against him.

“Nurse!” Lacey screamed, slamming her hand on the call button again and again.

Footsteps rushed down the hallway.

He vanished through the curtain in a flash.

The nurse burst in, breathless. “What happened?”

“Some guy came in here,” Lacey snapped. “I’ve never met him. He grabbed my chart and said he was my emergency contact.”

The nurse looked around the empty space, confused.

Her expression softened with a look of pity, like she thought Lacey was just disoriented. “It’s alright. If you don’t want him here, I won’t let anyone back in who shouldn’t be.”

Then she walked out as if nothing terrifying had happened at all.

Lacey tried to tell herself it was nothing. Maybe someone from the mental health ward, or just a random creep who wandered in. People like that exist everywhere.

She was discharged that night with a bag of medication and a bunch of AA leaflets she didn’t want to look at.

She didn’t bother turning on the lights when she got home. She went straight to bed and lay there, staring at the wall, trying not to think about the hospital, or the man, or the fact she’d ruined everything she’d worked for. She just wanted her brain to stop.

Then her phone pinged beside her.

No one ever messaged her anymore. The only texts she got were appointment reminders or scams.

With a sigh, she picked it up.

It was a number she didn’t know.

She tapped the message.

You didn’t eat today. She can’t heal on an empty stomach.

Lacey blinked at the words. She hadn’t eaten since she got home, but there's no way anyone would know that.

Ping.

You’re lying awake again.
She needs rest.

A cold feeling slid down her spine, the kind of shiver you get from being watched.

Whoever sent the messages didn’t just know her habits. They knew exactly what she was doing right now.

Her eyes went back to the number. Something about the last three digits tugged at her memory.

Then it clicked, she had seen that number before.

On the intake form.

The emergency contact.

Surely they couldn’t be.

If it was him… then the man from the hospital had her number.

With shaking fingers, Lacey blocked the number.

Silence.

No more pings.

After a few minutes she almost believed it was over, she even let her eyes start to close.

Then the phone vibrated again.

It was a new number this time.

Ping.
Why are you ignoring me?

Ping.
You’re supposed to be looking after her.

Ping.
You’re upsetting her.

Ping.
Drink water. She’s thirsty.

She pulled the blanket higher over her stomach and stood up just enough to slide the bedroom window shut and twist the lock. She hit the lamp on next to her.

Her phone pinged again.

Good. Close the window, she can't stand the cold.

Ping.

You look tired.

She had the sickening sense that if she looked outside the window, she’d see a face watching.

She didn’t feel alone anymore.

This guy was insane.

She grabbed her phone and dialled the police before she could think.

Trying to explain made her feel like the crazy one. A transplant. A man pretending to be her emergency contact. Texts describing exactly what she was doing right now.

The operator asked her to slow down and to read some of the messages out loud.

“So he’s… watching you inside your home right now?”

“And he wants you to rest?”

Lacey hated the way her voice broke. “I don’t know.”

“Is he in your home?”

“No.”

“Is he trying to get in?”

“…No.”

“Then you’re safe. Don’t reply to the messages. If he actually comes to your door, call us back.”

That was it.

Minutes passed.

Every tiny sound in the flat made her jump.

She kept telling herself there had to be another explanation.

Anything that wasn’t someone watching her right now.

Then the screen lit up again.

The messages had changed. They were darker, Obsessive.

You’re trying to keep her from me, just like the others.
You will never stop me seeing her.

She belongs with me, not with you.
You’ve already ruined your life, don’t ruin hers too.
She hates you.

Her thumb hovered over reply, shaking.

The three dots appeared, then stopped.

Instead, the phone rang.

Then another call.

She didn’t answer.

Voicemail received.

She pressed play.

His voice was gentle, he sounded upset.

“Let me talk to her. I know she’s there. Please… just answer, put the phone against your stomach. I miss her.”

Then another, but this time he sounded angry, his voice became erratic with hate.

“You’re putting her in danger, she’s not safe with you. She’s too good for a dirty alcoholic. I need to get her out.”

A stutter in his breath, like he was trying not to cry.

The voicemail ended.

She couldn’t cope. If there was ever a time she wanted a drink, it was now.

She lay just listening for the next horror to ping.

But the messages had stopped, so had the calls.

She stared at her door, listening to her own heartbeat, begging herself to stay awake.

But fear is exhausting.

At some point her eyes must have closed, because the next thing she registered wasn’t her phone.

It was the sound of her bedroom floor creaking.

Her room was in complete darkness.

The lamp she’d left on was off.

Her phone screen lit up as she moved. A message glowed, just a single text.

I didn’t want to rush this. I wanted you to heal first. But you’re making this harder than it needs to be. You’re not willing to cooperate and I won’t let you keep putting her at risk. I’m already here. She won't have to wait long.

Sent one hour ago.

Adrenaline rushed through her.

If he had been outside an hour ago, then where was he now?

She raised her phone and turned on the torch.

The beam shot out in front of her.

It landed on her front-door keys sitting neatly on her bedside table, where she definitely hadn’t left them.

She rotated it towards the door.

As it passed her desk chair she noticed it had been pulled slightly back, angled towards her bed, like someone had been sitting there, watching.

The shut door was now wide open.

She didn’t want to move the light any farther, but her hand kept going, straight to the other side of her room.

The torch touched the far corner.

And that's where he stood.

Right in the corner.

Motionless.

Expectant, waiting for her to wake up and realise.

He moved fast.

She hardly had time breathe before the cloth covered her mouth. 
The chemical fumes burnt as they went down.

“Shhh,” he whispered. “She used to love being scared. It meant she needed me.”

Everything slowed down until eventually it stopped altogether and it all went dark.

She woke to the smell of something rotten.

She tried to cover her nose but her body didn't move, she was strapped down. She could feel cold metal pushing through her top. Her legs and arms were held down tight against the table with thick rope.

A sound came from her left, faint breathing.

She forced herself to look.

Several bodies lay on metal surgical tables. Some breathing, just about. The others were not.

They were all women.

They were covered in blood, no effort had been made to stop it.
Their bodies were cut open in places where organs once sat inside.

Her eyes moved downward, to the nearest table.

A woman lay there, the sheet was pulled up to her collarbones.
Her skin was a lifeless grey
Bandages wrapped tight across her body, they completely covered her eyes.

She wasn't breathing.

But something shuddered under her skin like something underneath was trying to wake up.

And in the same second… Lacey felt a faint pulse under her own scar.

Like whatever was inside that woman had reached for her and something inside Lacey answered back.

She couldn’t keep looking at that body, she snapped her eyes away to anywhere but there.

And they landed on the wall behind.

Her gaze climbed upwards, then she saw her again.

Dozens of photos of the same woman.

She was beautifully radiant in the early ones, her sky blue eyes full of life.

Then slowly it began to fade.

Her once beautiful skin became dull, broken and bruised.

As the photos went on she didn’t look scared.
She looked drained and broken, as though she had given up.

The last photo was larger than the rest. It showed her body, as it is now, completely lifeless, deep red marks coiled around her throat.

Arrows were drawn toward her organs, lungs, heart, kidney, eyes...

Names and addresses were written next to each one, then crossed out.

Only one arrow remained uncrossed.

The liver.

For the first time, she wished her liver had failed completely. It would have been easier than this.

All these poor women, his wife couldn't even escape him in death and Lacey was next.

Her dark thoughts were broken by tapping footsteps from the other side of the room.

Lacey turned as he stepped into the light, his body trembled with devotion.

“I told her I was sorry. I didn't mean to do it,” he murmured. “I promised her I would make her better.”

He kept his eyes on Lacey’s stomach with pure, shaking relief, like he was seeing someone coming home.

He walked over and knelt down, stroking her scar like a parent calming a child.

“You hear her, don’t you?” he whispered, placing his ear over Lacey’s scar. “She’s waking up.”

Lacey pulled at her restraints but they wouldn't give  they just dug deeper into her skin.

Then there was a slap like flesh hitting something hard.
Lacey turned towards the woman’s body on the table.

Her arm jerked up and slammed back against the steel.

“See? Look how excited she is,” he beamed. He had an deranged look in his eyes.

“You’ll be better soon,” he murmured to the organ inside her. “She’s waited so long.”

Then he finally met Lacey’s eyes.

“But you won’t.”

He stood up straight and removed something long and sharp from his belt.

“Now, try not to move. I’ll be as quick as I can. I don’t want to keep a lady waiting now, do I?”

Lacey wanted to squirm as he pushed the metal blade onto her skin, but each time she did it dug in more.

“Shhh now,” he said calmly.

Lacey screamed. She slammed her eyes shut, readying herself for unimaginable pain, for something she had once wanted. Death.

Her pushed harder.

As the pain became unbearable, Lacey's body began to shut down from the shock.

Her vision became dark and hazy as she began to slowly lose herself.

Somewhere in the dark fog came the sound of metal hitting the concrete floor, followed by a heavy slump.

She pulled her eyes open with what little grip she had left. She could just make out the shape of a woman standing at the bottom of the table before she fell unconscious.

When Lacey came to, she was in a different room, it was larger. Rows of hospital beds lined every wall, it almost looked like an abandoned hospital.
Bandages covered her stomach.

A nurse moved through the room, the beds around her were full.

As she looked she realised she had seen these people before.

But they were no longer lying on the metal tables.

They were alive.

Their bodies stitched together and held upright with wires, IVs and clamps. Their skin pale, their bodies completely rebuilt.

Along the other wall there were new people. Not women this time.

Men. Terrified.

One begged and pleaded, some screamed and swore, another cried for forgiveness.

The pleading was different in every voice, but the message underneath was the same.

They all feared punishment.

Monitors lit up above their beds as the nurse walked between them.

Next to each was a note with a name on.

Lacey could just make out some of the writing that followed.

“Assault charge dismissed.”
“Restraining order violated.”
“Wife hospitalised.”
“Girlfriend missing.”

The woman stopped at one of the beds.

As she turned, Lacey’s heart stopped.

Her blue eyes were the same ones from the photos. Bright, alive, only colder now. Her ghost white skin rotting.

The man strapped there thrashed so hard his bed joined in.

She touched his cheek with what looked like tenderness.

He stopped and sobbed in relief.

A soft beep came from the machine above his bed, the picture changed.

HEART — MATCHED
RECIPIENT — UNIT 3

The woman’s lips cracked upward.

Lacey finally understood.

All the victims were being rebuilt.

Organ by organ.

I’ve been trying to put myself out there more, and figured I’d keep things simple. I’d love to grab a coffee with someone and just talk — nothing pressured or overly serious. Just two people seeing if there’s a vibe, sharing a few stories, maybe laughing a bit, and taking it from there.

I’m 34M, pretty easygoing, enjoy good conversation, and I’m genuinely interested in getting to know someone beyond the usual small talk. If you’re open to meeting up in a relaxed setting and seeing if we click, feel free to reach out. Worst case, we share a decent cup of coffee. Best case, maybe it turns into something meaningful.

Before you @ me for trying to get with a junior-ranking employee, we are, in fact, on the same level so there's no risk of coercion, quid pro quo, etc. Anyways, we struck up a conversation on the elevator one day and ended up spending lunch break together. Since then, we've been regularly hanging out, whether it's chatting on break or going out for coffee or drinks. She told me that she went through a messy divorce recently so she's not ready for a new relationship yet. Having been through a messy divorce myself (fat ex-wife took everything, including the obnoxious kids), I accepted that I would have to wait a while before things could get serious between us.

Being friends with Anna gave her the comfort of having someone to rely on in a pinch. Car broke down? I can drive her to and from work. Broken shelf? I have the tools and the knowledge to fix it. Moving to a different building? I can help transport stuff. I even pay for her food and drinks whenever we're together because I'm a gentleman and I insist. Besides, once we're actually together-together, I'll be doing the proper boyfriend duty of paying for his lady anyways.

Anna has frequently referred to me as ""her favorite person"" and squeezed my arm to note how strong I am (I work out every day to stay fit at my age). She also sends flirty pictures where she models outfits for dates. No, not dates with me, dates with other guys. They're never serious so I figure that she's just testing out the waters before giving it a shot with me.

Anyways, the other day, another coworker Nicole (28F) approached me and asked if I was in a relationship with Anna. I said that we were getting there eventually, and her expression looked both disappointed and relieved. She then showed me the group chat she and some of the younger ladies in the office were in, including Anna. Anna was bragging about having me wrapped around her little finger and how I was a plethora of free services (and food) for her. She even sent screenshots with commentary such as ""he's so pathetic"" and ""what an old fool."" I was heartbroken. I thanked Nicole for letting me know and decided to confront Anna during lunch break.

At lunch, Anna dismissed my hurt feelings and said it was just silly girl talk. I reminded her that she was a grown woman at age 28, and she rolled her eyes. She started complaining that I was on her for her ticking biological clock and that talking to HR sounded like a good idea. That scared the shit out of me because god forbid I become another male victim of female false accusations. I immediately got up and went to sit with some of my male colleagues.

Everything after that is a choice of gender normality","I had an interesting thought the other day. I was thinking about how people who are non-binary or gender fluid are challenging the normality of assigning genders to certain clothes, hairstyles, whatever. The thing is everything we do vanity wise is just a choice, sure it might not be our specific choices when we're younger, but it's a choice nevertheless. From when our parents choose what clothes we wear, to when they instruct the barber on how they want our hair to be done, to when we're all older and making those choices for ourselves.

You often see narrow minded individuals screeching about how ""unnatural"" it is to go against the grain, but the fact is, even choosing what is considered fairly common or not even noteworthy of how we conform to our born sexes is just as equally ""unnatural"". The only time in our lives when we're all 100% completely natural is when we're born.

And the thing is, how do we all look when we're born? Basically the same. You can be ""It's a boy!"" or ""It's a girl!"", but newborn babies all basically look exactly the same anyway. How many times have you seen a friend or colleague showing off pictures of their newborn and someone else saying ""Oooo, they have your x"" and then you see the picture yourself and you're like ""Yep... that's a baby, looking like every other baby I ever did see in my life"". As babies we all start out as blank slates, equals, with a base level of characteristics.

Through all of us, you can wear the most flashy clothes, the craziest haircuts, it doesn't matter. We all started out as bald, alien looking babies as natural and as neutral as the world we were brought into. I think that's almost beautiful in a way, as at the end of the day we all began life the same way, as literally everything after that is human, choice based influence, nothing more.

My point is simply this. It doesn't matter what you wear or how you decide to express yourself in your appearance in anyway, since it's all just based on choices. And we can choose our favourite foods, our favourite films, our favourite brand of coffee and no one will think about it twice. So go ahead and wear what isn't the norm, challenge the status quo of society, because from one bald, alien looking baby to another, you do you.",1,1764495112.0,lgbt,1,1.0,False

My job is a demanding desk job, I'm there for 9 to 10 hours, and I'm actively working for about 85% of that time. Besides the 45-minute lunch break, there might be 90 minutes spread throughout the day where I take a short walk or grab a coffee. The remaining 8 or 9 hours are non-stop work and concentration.

My day starts at 5:30 AM to get ready and leave, and I don't get back home before 6 PM, sometimes 7 PM. So that's 12 to 13 hours of my day gone. After all this time of being 'on', I'm completely drained. I feel like my brain is melted, and all I can do is collapse on the couch.

But then I read about people who supposedly go to the gym 4 times a week after work. Or read 150 books a year. Or their house is always immaculately clean. Or meet up with friends several times a week for dinner and outings.

Even stranger are the people who claim to do it all: they work 50+ hours a week, go to the gym consistently, read a lot of books, maintain a very clean home, and also have a vibrant social life. And they always attribute it to 'good time management' and act as if there are 30 hours in a day.

My only conclusion is that they are either exaggerating, or they have enough money to hire cleaners and meal prep services, or their job is very cushy and not mentally draining. The kind of job where 'work' consists of taking clients out to lunch.

This might describe about 15% of the working population.

I’m not sure if this is repetitive but I wanted suggestions to start my coffee journey on the right track. I’m fairly new to the coffee world, still learning and exploring. Currently, I have a French Press and I enjoy black coffee, cold/hot depending on my mood. I also like to experiment with tonic, soda, etc from time to time. Earlier I used to enjoy milk based coffees but have switched to black coffee recently. 
So coming to my main question, I have a budget of 15k. What should I buy to begin my coffee journey with? I’m confused a lot. ",1,1764494755.0,IndiaCoffee,1,1.0,False

1pae098,https://www.reddit.com/r/louisck/comments/1pae098/idea_for_a_louis_ck_seinfeld_spinoff/,idea for a louis ck seinfeld spinoff,"everybody thinks seinfeld was a show about nothin but rlly that is reivisonist history. the show about nothin was based on georges bad pitch to nbc in the show. seinfelt was supposed to be a show about how comedians get their material. 


so my idea would be that louis ck does a version of seinfeld where we see how he gets his material, except that louis had a near death experience n had to get a heart transplant from an nypd police officer who was shot (in the head not the heart) and killed on the job. 


when louis wakes up, the only material he can write is about this guys life. even when he tries to write his own material (eg. a priest and a lawyer walked into a room, they both had diareha), he just cant write material. its as if comedy comes from the heart, and losing his own heart detached him from his own life.


so louis goes through a crisis of competence where he has to decide whether taking jokes directly from a transplanted heart of a dead nypd officer makes him a joke theif like carlose mencia. he is about to quit comedy, but he gets the blessing to do it of the arbitor of joke theft, joe rogaine. 


louis is now super motivated and tries to write a tight five minute set but its all hacky surface level stuff like ""why do they call them the boys in blue, its 2025 some of them are women!"". louis gets frustratred at this guy bein a hack, but he realizes that back in 1992 some of his material was surface level and hacky too. it wasnt until he had daughters and began making fun of them for the entire world to see without their consent about him sharing their highly personal childhood experiences and completely shitting on him that he became famous enough to make secret life of pets money.


louis is discouraged because he has no idea where he got the heart from the hospital wont break hippo laws and tell him that its a hard nosed but honest nypd cop who was killed because he wouldnt go on the take. 


when louis leaves the hospital, a dog living outside the hosptial follows him home. at first he doesnt want the dog but it wont leave so he takes it in. the next morning, he takes it to the vet and they tell louis its microchip had an address on it. 


louis brings it to the address and a little girl recognizes the dog and is excited to see it (its her dead dads dog that left the night he died). louis talks to the mom and her dad was an ex-cop who was killed by being shot in the head not the heart. she says they were all worried sick about the dog including all his ex co-workers at the cop place. she mentions they were just going over there now to bring them a casserole to thank them for all their hard work looking for the dog and to let them know they found it. the daughter doesnt want to because she is tired. but the mom tells he rshe can sleep in the car. 


so louis goes with them and then he overhears them talking about a drug king pin who is going to walk because their co worker was so close to uncovering how they were sneaking in the cocaine in the new york harbours but before he could give them the evidence, he was shot in the head (not the heart). louis, almost instinctively, goes wait a minute do you mean the cocaine they were sneaking in cans of foldgers coffee and hiding in the store room fo the 52nd street bodega. 


the cops are like wtf are u talking about and louis is like i dont know look i just got this heart transpplant and ever since then ive heard things and when u guys talked about it that came to me. so there is a hard nosed cop who clearly didnt like the dead cop who was shot in the head and not the heart, and he tells them this guy is clearly on crack just leave him, but they go no i have a feeling about this, what are the odds that he jsut had a heart transplant and then somehow after being missing for weeks his dog ends up finding him? if i didnt know any better, johnnys heart is still alive and is tryin to tell us something through this cancelled comedian. louis tells them he shouldnt have said anything and he wants nothin to do with this stuff, its too weird. and he leaves. 


louis shows up the next day at the moms house and apologies 4 leavin like that. he says it wasnt really the cops tryin to use his intel for a drug bust and then grillin him about why he left. he said he left because he felt wrong about bein there. after delivering the dog and realizing whose dog it was, louis says the reason he even agreed to go to the cop place with her was because he had suspected that he was gettin comedy ideas from the transplanted heart but they were all hacky and surface level, and he thoguht maybe if he got to know the dead cops widow wife and famly, he could learn more about him and help the heart write good comedy where he makes fun of his daughter. the mom is upset at louie and says that the idea that her dead husband is speakin through the transplanted heart is nuts, while she thoguth louis's cancelalation was harsh she is going to have to ask him to leave and not come back, jsut as he opens the door to leave the house forever her ex-husbands partner is at the door, he enthusiastically says guess who just tipped us off to 30 kilos of cocaine hidden in folgers cans and heroe sandwiches, your dead husband speaking through that man, or should i say, my new partner.

the implication bein that louis now has to solve crimes as his partner, which forces the ex-wife to be in proximety to him, even know she isnt happy about the whole dead husbands heart communciating through louis.

it would be like a weekly procedural mixed with seinfeld where louis gets his jokes from hanging out with his new community of friends and family.

then when the first episode ends u can see louis do an inspired bit of comedy ""u ever have errands 2 run and ur kid says she is 2 tired. whats up withi that. why do kids think the world revolves around them. what a c word!"" (typical louis comedy gold). and we pan out from the stage and the only person in the crowd is the dog who barks at louis in applause, and louis looks defeated with the implication bein he is still cancelled and will have to solve crimes whether he likes it or not because it grants him proximety to the dead cops family to write less hacky non-surface level jokes.",0,1764494239.0,louisck,4,0.5,False

1padzb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1padzb5/i_was_discarded_by_my_closest_friend_and_i_dont/,I was discarded by my closest friend and I don't know how to let go of the bitterness and anger,"This happened over 1 year ago now. In my 30's.   
I lived with this friend for 4 years and they were my closest friend. I thought they were my platonic soulmate. I guess I had a need for them to be. It was a co-dependent dynamic and I observed that whenever they needed me and wanted to talk they were the most warm and receptive person. When they didn't need me, they were cold and dismissive. I compensated by getting lost when they needed me to get lost and made myself available 95% of the time they needed me.   
I got along well with their friends and family and they resented me for it. They asked me to stop talking to their cousin when she was visiting after their cousin opened up to me. They asked me to stop talking to their parents when they visited. I became friends with two of their friends and they asked me to not go to an event that their friend had invited me to.   
To keep the peace, I agreed to all of this and also looked the other way, abandoning myself. This is how I knew how to connect.   
When I got more attention at a speed dating event they invited me to, they were upset for days and called me an attention seeker, said I needed to check in with them in future.   
To be fair as this was during the pandemic and then after the pandemic I was working remotely and was often home. When they wanted me around they would sometimes beg me to stay home but they also told me that if I didn't start working outside the home, my living situation would be compromised. (It was their parent's home)   
Under that warning, I begged my boss to let me work at a co-working space which he did and I worked there as much as I could. She would check in with me so we wouldn't work from home on the same days. When I moved in, she was incredibly warm and was often praising me but then I started getting cut down a lot and subtly in front of others, especially when I was getting attention. I felt like I was walking on eggshells. In the last year of our living situation when I was grieving a difficult rejection from a guy friend she showed me no empathy. Called it ""The (my name) show""  and told me which Cluster B disorders she thought I had: including Histrionic and Borderline among others. (Both of her parents are doctors) She told me she always thought there was something wrong with me and she was the only one who could see past all my shit to the real person underneath.   
I started to really dislike her without admitting it to myself. I've always had a problem with directing anger towards myself over others to preserve the relationship. I told her I thought I should move out as her parents were not charging me any rent in the last year (Which made the power imbalance worse) and I knew I needed to be independent.   
She told me she had a replacement the next day-for a person we both knew to move in within 4 months. I ended up telling her months later that I didn't like her and how she treated me. I ended up releasing all of my hurt and sobbing in front of her. She awkwardly put her arm around me and then told me the next day I made her feel like a bad person.   
Fast forward to a few days before I moved out, she told me she needed me to cut off those 2 mutual friends I had. I told her I would but that I didn't feel sorry for her and I didn't have empathy for her. She was shocked and said nothing. She told me that I infiltrated her life.   
We talked about it the next day and I joked about it and then after I moved out, she was messaging me every day with hearts and everything until an abrupt stop. After 2 weeks of silence when I reached out to her to see if she wanted to meet up for a coffee, she sent me the coldest message like I was her ex. Told me she was not available and she would be in touch to drop my stuff off.   
In between all these moments of clear frenemy behaviour in 4 years she could be incredibly warm and seemingly supportive and like a dream best friend. She knew I had a fear of abandonment and she promised me: I would never abandon you. I am not the kind of person who does that. But that is exactly what she did. Iced me out and she did get back in touch 5 months later to check in and test the waters for her image offering to drop off a package for me. I replied neutrally and never heard back.   
Then 5 months after being discarded by my former friend, my mother who I thought was the closest person to me told me that I was not a victim, I allowed myself to be treated that way and sneered at me that my former friend and I deserved each other. Suddenly I realised why I had ended up in this dynamic in the first place. It started with my mother. I had deluded myself for 30+ years that my mother was the closest person to me when really she was deeply emotionally unavailable and I had been over functioning in that relationship. The truth is my mother is not capable of warmth and lacks empathy.   
I have been in therapy doing deep work but I am struggling to trust others. I hold onto so much bitterness and resentment. My whole family laughed at me. Told me they were waiting for me to get over it, asked if we were lovers and mocked me, that way worse things were going to happen to me and they were concerned that I wouldn't be able to handle life. And then my mom telling me we deserved each other. I cut contact with all of them.   
This is very unlike me because I was kind of the emotional glue in my family. I was called emotionally unintelligent and mocked but I never stopped trying to build relationships with them. I always felt lonely but I kept trying to connect. But that open-ness is just gone. I cannot sustain warmth with people I like. I live in my room and go out to get coffee, see my therapist multiple times a week and chat to baristas but I have to switch up places I go because I don't want the pressure of having to sustain connection.   
I have been called a charismatic person and am great with people but I always struggled with allowing people to get very close to me without collapse. I either collapsed into others or let others collapse into me. With my former friend I let her in the closest (though in this same way) and I am not the same person after this betrayal.   
I understand that forgiveness is the only way forward but I just cannot let go of this bitterness and resentment I feel towards her and my family. I feel like I am only hurting myself. It's like I cannot let good things happen to me either.

my brain is caging me into entropic patterns. so i will share my entropy. 

ive gotten sober of coffee. it is interfereing with the thought patterns. 

i dont know. one common thought pattern is this repetitive vision of a graveyard i visited in the ozarks. its bright blue sky with clouds and sunshine. 

like a looping image of tall grass water and the treeline. snapping upwards into the sky. like im sick. seeing the gravestone and a dead spider on it. 

another is limerence, a vision of happiness. this is the plague that ravages my mind.

another is a circular loop feeling. the serrated blades tearing my head from the inside slowly. like rusty barbed wire from a substation fence...

inside the electric substation stands pandora 

i luckily have some level of grounding techniques. i also learned that if i dont drink coffee daily. i gain more executive function and focus. i had a bad caffeine addiction.

great progress has been made into reconfiguring the axioms of my work into something easier to do for an angel of nothing like myself. i do not have much problems with a little bit of stress in that regard. because i believe very highly in my ideas.

the electric humm do you hear it? its the sound of heaven. the grand entropy that surrounds us all.

it bounces off every molecule of air and the inverse square law differentiates it until it is close to nothing. the world works in fantastic ways.

the blood rivers and the sight of pandora overlooking me over the torrent of red. occasionally you can see bones sticking out. they pass by quietly

i fear that pandora is going to kill me. one day ill be forced into suicide by hostile forces inside the trees.

the hostile forces. its hard to describe them. but theyre like stacked connected pale limbs that float inbetween tree branches. hands, arms, legs. but no head or torsos. they sit high above you.

observing them always generates a flash of light. and a loud sound. like you werent supposed to see them. but i see them in my head.

the future is what i fear the most. like those limbs are from the future and im going to end up like that when pandora decides shes had enough.


either way my head hurts pretty bad and i need to sleep.

Hey!

If you're hunting for that perfect blend of zen vibes and urban hustle, let me introduce you to something straight out of a modern-day samurai flick meets Bollywood glamour: Krisumi Waterfall Residences in Sector 36A, Dwarka Expressway, Gurgaon. It's India's first Indo-Japanese residential collab between Sumitomo Corporation (Japan's precision pros) and Krishna Group (our homegrown hospitality kings). Think: Nikken Sekkei architecture, Tata Projects build quality, and landscapes that whisper ""serene waterfall escape"" amid the city's roar.


These aren't just apartments—they're 3 & 4 BHK sanctuaries across two 34-storey towers on 5.43 acres. Ready to move in *now*, with families already settling in. Minimalist design, Japanese-inspired gardens, and water features that make your morning coffee feel like a spa ritual. RERA-approved (RC/REP/HARERA/GGM/2018/03), so no shady vibes here.

Why It's a No-Brainer for Gurgaon Life:

-Amenities That Slay: Olympic pool for laps, gym that doesn't suck, tennis/squash courts, private theatre for binge nights, fancy restaurant/bar, café, spa/salon, indoor games, creche for the kiddos, and 24/7 security that actually works.
- **Location Perks**: 25km to IGI Airport (NH-48 zoom), minutes from metro, direct Dwarka Expressway/NH-8 access. MNCs, IT parks, top schools, and hospitals? All a quick drive away. Perfect for commuters or remote warriors.
- **Investment Angle**: High ROI in Gurgaon's hot zone—appreciation city. Flexible payments, NRI-friendly, and immediate possession. If you're eyeing property flips or long-term holds, this screams ""smart money.""

I've been geeking out over the fusion of cultures—Japanese efficiency with Indian warmth? Sign me up. But real talk: Is Gurgaon's market still booming in 2025, or are we cooling off? Worth the premium for that waterfall aesthetic, or should I scout alternatives like DLF or Godrej?

1padksa,https://i.redd.it/41llvbo4yc4g1.jpeg,My Bestie Tied My Fiancé's Tie - does anyone have a link?,"Chapter 1
At a party, my best friend told me she was seeing someone.
I laughed and asked her who it was.
She just smiled, her eyes fixed right on my fiancé.
I didn't think much of it until the speeches, when she beat me to it and reached out to fix my fiancé's tie.
The way they looked so natural and intimate left me stunned. She just smiled and explained:
""Sorry, force of habit from fixing my boyfriend's. Hope you don't mind.""
I was silent.
When I got home that night, I told my fiancé:
""Let's call off the engagement.""
He frowned impatiently. ""All because she fixed my tie?""
1.
""You know nothing's going on between us. I've never crossed a line.""
I scoffed, my eyes landing on the dark gray, textured tie before looking back up at him.
""But you let her cross the line.""
Jackson's brow furrowed, his impatient tone now laced with accusation.
""She already told you, she's just used to doing it for her boyfriend. She saw my tie was crooked and helped out, that's all.""
""It's one thing to throw a little fit, but this engagement was arranged by our families. It's not a game.""
I stared at him in disbelief. Helped out, that's all?
What kind of guy is perfectly fine with his fiancée's best friend fixing his tie?
My expression went cold. ""Liliana looked more natural fixing your tie than I ever do.""
Jackson's face darkened instantly.
""My tie was crooked. She noticed. She was standing closer, so she helped.""
""So you're saying if it had been anyone else standing there with a crooked tie, she would've done the same thing for them!""
""You're my fiancée, you didn't even notice something was wrong with my tie, and now you're going to blame me?""
I couldn't believe my ears. In his eyes, this was somehow my fault.
I let out a bitter laugh. ""Aren't you the one blaming me right now?""
Jackson pursed his lips, his patience clearly gone. ""She's your best friend. Don't you know what kind of person she is?""
""We're all adults here. Don't get all paranoid over nothing.""
I sighed, picking up the tie and then setting it back down.
""Jackson, fixing a tie is an intimate gesture, isn't it? Something you only do for people you're close to?""
""And like you said, I do know what kind of person she is. If she's willing to cross a line like that, it means she got the green light from the other person. Do you take me for an idiot?""
He reacted like I'd stepped on his tail, snapping:
""Ruby, are you done yet?""
""You see a guy and a girl helping each other out, and your mind immediately jumps to something shady?""
I froze, a bitter smile on my face. ""So in your eyes, I'm just one of those girls who thinks everything is about sex?""
Jackson cleared his throat, guiltily looking away.
""Let's not get sidetracked. We're talking about the merger marriage.""
""This affects the future of both our families. Stop being so childish.""
""You know how marriage works in our circle. I'm not saying we'll have totally separate lives after we're married, and I don't plan on starting a family with any other woman. You should be grateful.""
I just stared at him, at the way he acted like he was doing me some huge favor. The man in front of me felt like a total stranger.
""And look, even if there was something going on with Liliana—which there isn't—a smart woman would know to look the other way, not make a federal case out of every little thing.""
""In return, I wouldn't ask questions about your... private life.""
How generous. Making me out to be the one who's nitpicking.
Suddenly, it all just felt so pointless. I'd been in love with Jackson for ten years.
Even though it was an arranged marriage, he was the one who personally agreed to it before the engagement.
I thought that by agreeing to the marriage, he must have had at least some feelings for me.
Now I see that was all just wishful thinking.
In Jackson's eyes, there were no feelings between us. Only business.
Fine. My parents never thought this was a good idea from the start, anyway.
Jackson pinched the bridge of his nose, annoyed. ""Your father's birthday is the day after tomorrow. Our families are getting together for dinner to discuss the wedding date.""
""You're clearly not in a good state of mind, so just stay home and rest for the next couple of days.""
I stayed silent.
There was no way this wedding was happening.
The next day, I was in the middle of packing my bags when Jackson called.
I watched his name, ""Jackson,"" flash on the screen next to the little heart emoji. It rang for a good thirty seconds before I finally answered.
""Ruby, what are you up to right now?""
His tone was so affectionate, you'd never know we'd just had a massive fight.
""I left a file at home. I'm at a hotel negotiating a deal, and I need it for the signing in a bit. Can you do me a favor and bring it to me?""
My knuckles turned white as I gripped my phone, the refusal caught in my throat.
""My assistant had a family emergency and took the day off, and I can't get away. You're the only one I could call.""
After a moment of silence, my resolve softened, and I agreed.
""Send me the address.""
Twenty minutes later, I arrived at the hotel.
But as I passed one of the rooms, I heard a voice through the half-open door. And of all people, it was Liliana.
Chapter 2
""Your tie's crooked again.""
Her tone and smile were way more natural than they were at the company gala yesterday.
""Here, let me straighten that for you.""
Then, the man with his back to the door shuffled closer to her.
""Well, you're the one who messed it up. You're like a little kid, you can barely stand straight. You would've totally wiped out if you hadn't grabbed my tie.""
I froze on the spot, my feet feeling like lead.
I knew that silhouette all too well. It wasn't just anyone—it was my fiancé, Jackson Bennett.
Liliana wrapped her arms around Jackson's neck, so close it was practically an embrace.
She tilted her head affectionately, her eyes landing right on me.
As our eyes met, I saw the smile in hers clear as day. It wasn't a challenge—it was mockery.
As if she were mocking my wishful thinking.
Suddenly, pretending she'd only just noticed me, her voice shot up.
""Ruby, what are you doing here?""
Jackson turned and opened the door.
Liliana stood at his side, looking both innocent and completely unfazed.
Jackson didn't offer any explanation. His eyes just landed on the folder in my hand.
""Just give me the file.""
I didn't say a word, didn't move. My eyes were fixed on the tie on his chest.
It was perfectly straight, and the style was almost identical to the one he wore yesterday.
As if I could still see the ghost of Liliana's fingerprints on it.
""I was just helping Jackson organize some files and noticed his tie was crooked again.""
Liliana explained it so casually, as if she were talking about something as mundane as brushing her teeth.
A flicker of contempt, almost too quick to see, flashed in her eyes.
Jackson took the file. ""Good thing you got this here when you did. Any later and it would've been a huge problem.""
My gaze calmly shifted to the lipstick smear on his neck he hadn't quite wiped away.
I pointed to my own neck, my voice flat. ""Looking like that, I'm sure you'll have no trouble holding things up.""
Realization dawned on him. He guiltily touched his neck, fumbling for his phone to check the screen.
""Must've happened when I was busy. I probably just brushed up against something.""
A dead giveaway.
Liliana immediately handed him a tissue, and Jackson took it just as naturally.
""Don't worry, Ruby. When has Jackson ever messed things up? He'll be fine.""
Her gaze met mine, the challenge in her eyes completely undisguised.
""File's delivered. I'm leaving.""
As I turned to leave, I heard them start whispering behind me. I didn't have the energy to figure out what they were saying. I just walked out of that hotel without a backward glance.
I had barely stepped out of the hotel when I got a text from Liliana.
""Ruby, don't get the wrong idea. There's really nothing going on between me and Jackson.""
I didn't answer. I went straight to the apartment I shared with Jackson, packed a bag, and drove to my house on the south side of town.
I hadn't figured out how to face my parents yet, so I planned to just lay low here for a while.
That night, around midnight, my phone started ringing off the hook.
It was Jackson, calling again and again.
I watched the number I knew by heart flash across the screen, and a sliver of foolish hope started to grow inside me.
I didn't pick up until the last second before it went to voicemail.
""Hello, is this Ruby Miller?""
""Mr. Bennett is really drunk and keeps demanding to see you. You should probably come get him.""
It was loud on the other end of the line—sounded like a bar.
Before I could even say no, they hung up.
I frowned and called the number back.
""Why aren't you here yet? D-don't you want me anymore...?""
He sounded heartbroken. I'd never heard him like this before.
I sighed. In the end, I went to the bar anyway.
The second I walked in, I saw Jackson slumped in a corner booth.
A sea of empty bottles covered the table in front of him, and his face was flushed red all the way down to his neck.
He must have been drinking a lot. He looked miserable.
I was about to walk over, but then I saw who was with him—Liliana.
Jackson threw his arms around her. ""What took you so long?""
""I've been waiting forever. What took you so long?""
There was a whiny, almost childish quality to his voice—the kind you only use with someone you're incredibly close to.
A side of him I'd never seen before.
I froze again, unable to take another step. So he hadn't been calling for me. I'd just been flattering myself.
Then again, when had I ever not been?
Chapter 3
""Damn, who knew Mr. Bennett, the corporate shark, could be like this?""
""You guys are totally in love.""
The crowd's teasing made a blush creep up Liliana's face.
""But can he even tell who's in front of him right now?""
Jackson slammed his hand on the table, his voice booming.
""Of course I can! It's the love of my life, Liliana.""
In that second, the last shred of hope I was clinging to shattered.
So it was always Liliana. Never Ruby.
Maybe even my nickname was just because of her.
""My Liliana loves strawberry cake, takes her coffee black, and can't handle anything spicy. Even a little bit makes her feel sick. Her period is...""
Listening to Jackson list off every little detail about Liliana, I felt the blood freeze in my veins.
A chill shot up from the soles of my feet, piercing right through me.
He could never remember a single thing about me.
For instance, I hate anything strawberry-flavored, but that never stopped him from bringing me strawberry desserts after work.
I used to think he was just busy with work, that he was a typical guy who didn't get all the little things women care about.
Now I get it. It wasn't that he didn't get it; he just didn't get me.
When he brought me those desserts, he was thinking of her.
""And the best part is, my Liliana isn't stiff and boring like Ruby Miller. That girl has zero spark.""
The people next to him chimed in, ""You guys are definitely the real deal!""
Jackson looked proud. ""Of course we are. If it wasn't for Liliana, I never would've agreed to this arranged marriage with Ruby Miller.""
""After Ruby and I get married, I'm gonna lay it all out for her... The one I love is Liliana, I...""
Liliana feigned a shy blush. ""Don't just say everything out loud, there are so many people here.""
""He's drunk, he's just talking nonsense.""
She told him to stop talking, but she didn't actually try to stop him. Instead, she seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the flirting and the crowd's hollering.
I couldn't stand it for another second. I turned to leave and ran right into Jackson's best friend, Brayden Black.
""Ruby Miller?""
""You're here. Why aren't you going in?""
Everyone in the private room heard him and their heads whipped around to look at me.
Liliana looked over, feigning panic. ""Ruby, you... what are you doing here?""
I froze. Didn't you specifically ask me to come here?
Just so I could see how deeply in love you two are.
""Who... who's here? Liliana, who...?""
Jackson was completely out of it, his words slurring together.
Seeing me, the crowd fell into an awkward silence.
Liliana supported the stumbling Jackson as she walked a couple of steps toward me.
""Ruby, don't get the wrong idea. I was just passing by and saw Jackson was drunk, so I came to check on him.""
What a pathetic excuse. A blatant provocation. Does she take me for an idiot?
My hands started to tremble uncontrollably.
""He's been calling for you. Since you're here, I'll get going. Take good care of him, and more importantly, take care of yourself.""
Without a second thought, she shoved him at me, then looped her arm through Brayden's. ""By the way, weren't you wondering who my boyfriend is? Well, this is him.""
""Bye-bye~""
I stared in disbelief at their retreating backs. I wondered if Jackson would be as devastated as I am when he finds out the girl he's so obsessed with is hooking up with his best friend.
Shoved away by her, Jackson staggered and was about to fall.
I instinctively lunged forward and caught him.
""Liliana, let's go home.""
My heart felt like it was being sliced open with a dull knife. I fought back the stinging in my eyes and said coldly, ""Look closely. See who I am.""
But instead, he yanked me into his arms, holding me tight.
All the while, he kept muttering the name of the woman who had just left.
This was an embrace I once craved more than anything. Now, it just made me feel sick.
I tried to push him away, but Jackson's grip was incredibly tight.
My shoulders ached under the pressure.
Defeated, I had no choice but to take him home.
Chapter 4
I put him in the passenger seat and started driving home.
The night wind blew by, and I wondered if it was sobering him up.
""This is the wrong way. No, this isn't my place.""
I ignored him and focused on driving.
The next second, he pulled out his phone, opened a map app, and showed me an address.
I pulled over and looked closely at the address he was pointing to.
My eyes fell on the search bar.
The search history was filled with directions from our future home to another apartment complex.
That complex was the ""home"" Jackson had been talking about.
It felt like everything clicked into place. I fought back tears and drove him to the destination.
The door code was Liliana's birthday.
There were two pairs of slippers by the door—a matching set for a couple.
The whole apartment was filled with signs of him living with another woman.
And I knew, with a sickening certainty, that the woman was Liliana.
Not only did he not love me, but even the things he'd said when we fought were lies.
From start to finish, not a single moment of his affection had been real.
I dumped him on the sofa and turned to leave.
That's when I spotted a medical report on the coffee table. It was Liliana's.
The blood type section was marked Rh-negative.
It was all too familiar. That's my blood type. It's so rare that I've been terrified of getting hurt my whole life.
No wonder. No wonder Jackson said he'd agreed to marry me for Liliana's sake.
One was the friend I trusted most, the other was the man I'd loved for ten years, my fiancé.
And they wanted to use me as a walking blood bank, to drain me dry.
So all those times he worried about me getting hurt... he was just afraid Liliana would lose her premium blood supply.
Looking back, all his sweet gestures, the ones I'd treasured like honey, were actually poison. Now they felt like a thousand tiny needles digging into my bones.
Staring at the man I'd loved for so many years, all I felt was a hollow sense of absurdity.
I put the report down and got up to go, but Jackson's hand was still gripping mine, refusing to let go.
Just as I was trying to pull away, he let go.
But the next second, he yanked me down onto the sofa, flipping over to pin me beneath him.
""Liliana, I'm sorry. Don't be mad. I've been good, I haven't touched Ruby this whole time.""
I watched Jackson run his hands over me, his movements eager, and a wave of nausea churned in my stomach.
Tears streamed down my face as I slapped him hard.
""Jackson, you're disgusting.""
I practically fled the apartment.
The next day was my dad's birthday, held at my family's estate.
When I arrived, both sets of parents were already there, chatting over tea.
Jackson looked the same as always; you couldn't even tell he'd been wasted the night before.
I cut right to the chase. ""Mom, Dad, Mr. and Mrs. Bennett, I'm calling off the engagement.""
Everyone in the room froze. Jackson's brow furrowed, and he snapped impatiently.
""Ruby, that's enough. This is not the time or place for a tantrum.""
""Are you really doing this just because Liliana fixed my tie?""
I stared right at his deceitful face. ""Yes, it's because Liliana fixed your tie. But it's not just that.""
""Ruby, I already explained that. I'm not going to explain it again. I swear, other than that, I haven't done anything to wrong you...""
Before he could finish, I cut him off, my voice cold.
""Are you sure about that?""
Hearing that, a flicker of guilt crossed his eyes.

I moved to Milwaukee about 3 months ago and I’m still getting used to the city. I’m **25M**, single, originally **from India**, and it’s been a bit tough meeting people so far.

I don’t drive yet, so getting around and socializing has been a little challenging. I’m also pretty introverted at first — it takes me a bit to warm up — but once I’m comfortable, I’m easygoing and talkative.

I’m mainly looking to **make friends**, meet people, and build a small circle here. And if I happen to connect with someone on a deeper level, I’m definitely open to that too — I’d love to find something meaningful if it naturally happens.

I’m really into **hiking, nature, trails, and exploring outdoors**. If you enjoy parks, walks, or weekend hikes, we’ll probably get along well. I also like checking out new spots around Milwaukee, coffee places, and chill hangouts.

And just putting this out there politely — **I hope people don’t judge based on where I’m from**. I’m just here to meet genuine people and make real connections.

As it goes, I've been through relentless trauma as an audhd woman who grew up disabled and neglected in an abusive addicted household Am actually currently, right now, still disabled to a degree, despite being on meds that are working. And still living with a childhood abuser (they've improved a bit since then but my nervous system still identifies them as a threat). So, that's also messed up, but I haven't had the option to find a place of my own due to crummy mental health the last few years (I've been addressing it piece by piece)....blah blah....I'm not complaining, I'm just addressing this truthfully. 


So, lo and behold, entering what is traditionally the darkest few months in my psyche (winter), I start hanging out with a guy I was acquaintances with in highschool, and we are establishing a friendship. 


He is safe, he is kind, he is tender, gentle, and compassionate. He is graceful, forgiving. I actually don't have male friends anymore because of the abuse I've been through, but I thought I'd give it a shot connecting with him as he has always just been *safe*. He was the one exception I stumbled upon seemingly by accident (literally-- I had a dream he was in quite randomly and then I considered him, realizing actually I would quite like to have some more of him in my life).


He makes me feel like all the problems in the world melt away when I'm with him. If I could spend all day near him I would. It's like talking to an angel sometimes, you know?


And that, my friends, was EXACTLY the problem. 


So apparently, I've learned this about myself, after so many years of trauma, including living in a psychological thriller/horror movie for over a year and a half a handful of years ago, (I'll spare you the details but it was excruciating) my nervous system apparently adjusted to expecting pain, suffering, and for men to be scheming, conniving, dishonest, jealous, vindictive, cheating, and downright murderous towards me. 


And what that has meant, was quite literally the most confusing responses that my body has given me to this new feeling of safety, freedom, and feeling there's room to breathe again after the first few times of spending time with this person.


After our first meetup/date, I got in my car, sighed, said, ""that was really nice"", and then smiled, and then I drove home while waves of impending doom crashed over me, and I screamed and sobbed and sighed and raged out, feeling nothing but blind terror, anger, humiliation, and shame. I felt like a cruel trick had been played on me. I liked that hangout-- surely, at this very moment, it had been taken away from me already. 


I went home shaking like a leaf and then when he texted me to tell me he enjoyed our time together, I literally hid my phone and cried because, honestly, *feeling safe, respected, genuinely appreciated by a good man is not something which I was familiar with.* I had flashbacks to being stalked, hit, and humiliated in front of others. What felt like purely unexpected torture, somehow, was being cleaned out. Because after I felt that one fully, the next time it showed up it was much softer, easier to feel through. 


So, after spending a few weeks hanging out, including me yammering on for literal hours while he listens with the presence of a saint (I'm not sure why he finds this bearable but hey, I'm verbally processing soooo much each time we spend time together), and having a very nice snuggle on his couch (that became my happy place which I've mentally returned to sooo many times since that day), we've both agreed to remain friends and keep things casual between us as he's not ready for a relationship and neither am I. 


However, I didn't realize I wasn't ready until this past week I saw myself with such clarity and acceptance that I looked around and I realized, damn, my brain, and my nervous system are fucked up. My life has been fucked up. I am sort of a chaotic mess right now....and in fact I always have been, I admitted. Truths which finally landed like stepping barefoot in broken glass. It was something I had to walk through to the next step. 


Because it really is that way. While I shared so many stories with him, I finally felt the courage to feel things for how they are, how they have been, instead of running them through several filters of guilt that ends up making me sound like an ungrateful bad guy instead of a girl who genuinely grew up traumatized and barely given the chance to stand up after being knocked down repeatedly. I finally shared pieces of myself with total honesty. And it was like.....looking back at an entire village burned to the ground. Everything....just rubble, and smoldering coals, and bad smells, almost nothing salvageable. It was honestly the first time I ever saw my life clearly. You could hear pain in my voice, tears came flooding out unexpectedly, and I didn't try to hush it, I just let me be what I needed to be and held calm, present space while I unfolded this deep, aching monster that has been buried alive for ages. And he stood there next to me and listened. Calm, grounded presence. 


In that moment I no longer felt buried alive, I felt something powerful: I felt a sense of control for the first time ever. I felt like finally I knew who I was in relation to those events, and I finally started to believe myself, all because a man sat down next to me and listened quietly while I decided to unravel some things. Being witnessed. So simple. So powerful. 


Since then, I've become a different person completely. My mindset shifted.


I've realized I've gotta sever ties with those beliefs that her suffering could never justify the pain she felt, as I've entered a new chapter and those things no longer resonate with me. 


Knowing this, and knowing my brain and nervous system have already let go of so much already, I feel both the most vulnerable I have ever felt, and also the most cognizant and capable.  That really changed me. And, I felt safe enough to accept these things....not just because of who stood beside me, but because I allowed myself to show up for me in a male's presence. That was a brave thing to do. (There, I said it-- I am brave). 



So, this marks the day it finally sinks in that I have someone on my team who is a friend, an ally, someone who finds supporting me to be completely effortless. And their name is me. Second of all, there is another person like this, and that is my new male friend. I can breathe deep breaths into my lungs again. I show up just like me-- fucked up, completely a mess, backwards and upside down, cussing left and right, saying things awkwardly, getting tangled up, laughing about how much I am just totally abnormal and yet I'm met with compassion. Presence. Softness. Stillness. From myself, and from somebody who holds space. 


I don't know quite why I'm writing this. Maybe because I'm feeling something called hope that has turned more into something I'll name as faith. It's faith in myself. I am showing up for me each day, no matter how hard it is. I'm taking baby steps, and it's working. 


Somewhere inside, a little bird perches on the end of a twig, singing it's heart out. He sings and sings and sings because he has something to say, and because it feels pleasant to set himself free. And if the branch breaks, he trust that he will catch his fall with his own wings first, and not have to rely on the outside to make him happy anymore. 


I'm feeling kinda like that bird right about now. Maybe those things had to turn to ashes because I'm already starting a new life, a new chapter, a new way of seeing the world and myself. All it took was the bravery to look at myself through the lens of acceptance. 


""Once you know your wounds, once you know all your great tragedies, and how you've decided you feel about them, then you will walk forward from them untethered. Understanding sets us free""


I'm so, so thankful for that. 


And I did that. Through the hardest five years of my damn life, even unmedicated for 97% of it, recovering from extreme trauma, barely able to breathe most days, frozen in bed, shivering....I believe it's possible to move forward because I've lived it. I've already entered the new chapter where I finally get to discover myself in a greater way. And it feels so refreshing. ",2,1764492069.0,AuDHDWomen,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Cornell Big Red vs. Bucknell Bison: A David vs. Goliath Showdown (With Fewer Giants)**  
*By Your Humorously Analytical Sports Oracle*

**Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Teams**  
Let’s start with the numbers because, let’s face it, Bucknell’s chances here are about as likely as me understanding a quantum physics lecture. The betting lines paint a clear picture: **Cornell is the favorite**, with moneyline odds hovering around **1.38 to 1.44** (implying a **72-75% implied probability of winning**). Bucknell, meanwhile, is priced between **2.85 and 3.05** (a **33-35% chance**), which is sportsbook lingo for “don’t bet your rent on this.” The spread is **Cornell -5.5**, meaning bookmakers expect the Big Red to win by a margin that could buy a small coffee farm. The total line sits at **157.5 points**, with “Under” slightly favored—probably because these teams combined for the offensive excitement of a tax audit last season.

**Statistical Shenanigans**  
Cornell’s offense is a well-oiled machine, averaging **21.7 assists per game**—led by Jacob Beccles, who dishes out 3.5 dimes per contest. For context, Bucknell’s entire team averages **11.9 assists**. It’s like comparing a symphony orchestra to someone tapping a spoon on a teacup. The Big Red also shoot **48% from the field**, while Bucknell’s opponents shoot a paltry **44.7%**. If basketball were a cake, Cornell would be the rich chocolate ganache layer, and Bucknell would be the “surprise raisin” in the middle.

Defensively, Cornell allows **83.5 points per game**, which is… generous. Bucknell scores **65.9 PPG**, which is 17.6 points fewer than what Cornell’s defense lets up. It’s the basketball equivalent of showing up to a barbecue and realizing you’re the only one who brought a fork.

Now I log in at 9, stare at my email, open a document, read the same sentence ten times, then drift off to make coffee. I scroll my phone for almost an hour. I go to the bathroom. I drag myself through tasks that used to take me twenty minutes. My boss, who used to praise my work, now has this concerned tone in our 1:1s. I nod and say I’m “on it,” knowing I’ve barely touched anything.

I am exhausted all the time. Completely empty. But somehow also full of this constant, buzzing anxiety I can’t shut off.

I keep telling myself I’m just lazy. That I’m wasting every advantage I had. That other people would kill for my life and I’m ruining it. I don’t even know if this is depression because I don’t feel sad. I feel gone. Weekends feel the same. No energy for friends. Just lying on my couch, ordering food, watching TV I’m not even paying attention to.

I don’t know what this is. I just know the person I used to be is gone, and whatever is left feels pathetic.

**Edit:** Someone here once told me to stop keeping everything in my head and actually write out what I’m feeling. I started using MindDump after u nightowlreader mentioned it. It hasn’t fixed everything, but it helped me understand what’s been happening instead of just assuming I’m broken. If you see this, thank you.",1,1764491931.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False
1paddw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1paddw4/rebuilding_instead_of_resisting/,Rebuilding instead of resisting,"[TLDR]

I have been drinking more often over the past year, mostly from stress and uncertainty. Trying to force myself to stop has not worked. I want to rebuild my life so alcohol is no longer part of it and focus on becoming the version of myself I still see in rare clear moments.


I was okay for a few days after August’s real failure. I told myself I could moderate, enjoy a drink or two. I was wrong. It got worse this time, not in how I behaved but in how often I drank. Three or four days per week. The hangovers became heavy, and the mental gymnastics were draining. Promising myself I wouldn’t drink and then failing started to eat away at my confidence. I feel ashamed, embarrassed, and hopeless. These negative feelings feed the trigger.


This time, I want to try a different approach. Trying to stop didn’t work for me. Resisting the urge, thinking about drinking, negotiating with myself, finding excuses until I finally opened a bottle, all of it is mentally exhausting. Resisting isn’t for me. I need to build a lifestyle where drinking is not part of it. I need to stay busy and content enough that I don’t even think about alcohol.


Alcohol was always on the horizon when I was growing up. My parents never forbade it. When I wanted, I would take a sip from their glasses. They were not drinkers themselves, but on holidays and special occasions it was part of the culture to make local alcohol. I didn’t choose to drink on my own until I left home for university.


At university, I bought alcohol for the first time on my 19th birthday. I went out with my roommates and we had one glass of wine. I enjoyed the buzz. It helped me relax and show the fun side of myself. Normally, I was shy and uncomfortable in groups.


Then I lost my mom. Drinking to not feel started around that time. I think that was the start of the cycle: negative emotions leading to drinking, taking stupid risks, and then the guilt and shame afterward. It wasn’t out of hand, but it happened a few times per year until I finished my studies. Then real life started. I was still drinking socially, but I also began drinking alone at home when I had problems with my ex. So many embarrassing moments. So many risks. And by then, I had my daughter too.


My life went on like that, hiding in a bottle whenever life threw a challenge at me. The episodes were short lived. Usually it was just a drunken night once in a while. That changed about five years ago. After moving to a different country and dealing with the pandemic, drinking became a routine at the end of the week. I would buy a bottle of red wine, cook a dish from home, and call my family. I enjoyed that. But when life got tough, I started craving it more often. Slowly, it spread to other days too.


It stopped being fun once the stress of living abroad alone and worrying about my residency grew. A night once in a while turned into a few days per week, sometimes until blackout. Then I finished my contract and moved in with my boyfriend at the time. The drinking stopped during that period. I still drank socially, but drinking alone disappeared until uncertainty in the relationship returned. After that, the usual self-sabotage came back. I even started putting whiskey in my morning coffee.


The relationship ended, and the drinking ended with it. Not because I was trying to quit, but because I was focused on rebuilding my life. I did not drink for eight or nine months. Then my residency issues began. What I thought would be a temporary problem dragged on for more than a year and still is not resolved. Living with a suspended deportation order is extremely stressful. I can’t plan anything more than a month ahead. I can lose my job without protection. My savings would last only a few months. I can’t move out of the small apartment I share with my daughter. This is the period I am in now.


I am exhausted by the rollercoaster. I think I might be depressed. I feel numb. Sometimes I feel like myself for a second, the person who had hopes, who loved life, who cared about growth, the strong one.
This is my longest and heaviest drinking period. It has been almost a year of trying to stop. I told my daughter and my friend that I wouldn’t drink in 2025. I am not sure I truly tried. I stopped for short periods and then started again.


I have decided to build a life where I can sustain the version of myself that appears in those brief flashes. I am someone who loves life, who is usually happy no matter what happens, who has hope, who values growth. I am a mom who loves her daughter more than anything. I love seeing her smile and I hate seeing my mood and stress dim it.


So this time, I am not going to try to stop. I am going to rebuild and structure my life so alcohol has no place in it. I don’t need to change who I am. I like the version of myself that appears when the fog lifts. I need to bring her out.",3,1764491816.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl ( cue the song ) and I’m looking to make a friend , someone to text about everything , nothing and all the dumbassery in-between . 

 Here are some random things about me to see if we have a click : 
I’m 21 years old. I have ADHD (read: I find something new to fixate on every other week). I enjoy reading (currently reading Zomerhuis met zwembad), journaling, baking ,crafting , long walks in nature.

I don’t really enjoy watching movies but I love series (currently watching Lang Leve de Liefde and KOTH). I enjoy online crossword puzzles, going down YouTube rabbit holes and reading random Wikipedia articles. I speak 3 languages and I’m slowly learning a 4th. 

**Things to expect if we become friends**  
• Good morning messages (might not be sent in the morning)  
• Random song recommendations  
• Someone that you can annoy at any time of the day  
• Virtual coffee dates (or whatever drink floats your boat)

Does that sound pretty cool to you ? If yes text me ;) if no text me anyways ;))

This is purely from my own experience — yours might differ, but hopefully this helps set expectations.

PROS



1. Completely free accommodations and meals

You get your own hotel room (yes, solo!), plus free breakfast, lunch, dinner, and two snacks. There’s also free coffee in the pantry. For a training program, this is rare and honestly one of the biggest perks.



2. Well-organized curriculum

They use Canvas as their learning platform, and the daily lessons are organized clearly. Everything stays accessible if you want to review or double-check something.



3. Competent, professional trainer

Our trainer knew what he was doing and maintained proper boundaries — friendly but not overly familiar. It helped the environment feel focused and professional.



4. You’ll meet a lot of new people

As with any group setting, you’ll encounter all personality types (main characters, drama queens, quiet ones, etc.), but overall it’s a solid environment for networking and making friends.



5. Comfortable training space

The venue setup was comfortable enough to stay focused throughout the day.

CONS



1. Some lessons felt rushed

There were days when multiple outputs were required, and the pacing got tight. You’ll likely end up self-pacing or reviewing in your own time just to keep up.



2. One lead gave off unsettling vibes

Hard to explain, but there was one lead who just felt… off. Not necessarily unprofessional, but the vibe wasn’t comforting.



3. Watching people not make the cut is rough

It’s inevitable that not everyone will pass, and honestly, witnessing that part is heartbreaking. You get close to people fast in a 2-week program.

Final Thoughts



To the passers — good luck, you earned it.

To those who didn’t — something better is definitely waiting for you. Programs like this don’t define your potential.
