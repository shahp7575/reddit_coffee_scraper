My family and I are planning to visit Larnaca around February 10th (for about 10 days) to get a real feel for the city, because we’re considering a possible move. I work in DevOps, and I’m coming with my wife and our two young kids (2.5 and 5)



I’d really appreciate any practical tips:

\- Is mid-February a good time to properly “experience” Larnaca (weather, wind/rain, how busy it is) and explore neighborhoods?

\- What are your top 3 family-friendly areas in/around Larnaca (safe, calm, close to schools/kindergartens, parks)?

\- For a 10-day stay, what’s best: apartment / hotel / Airbnb — and which trusted websites or agencies do you recommend?

\- Any tips on what to watch out for with rentals to avoid scams or unrealistic listings?

\- For a family, is a car a must in Larnaca, or can we manage without one for those 10 days?

\- For IT/DevOps: what are the best job websites / recruiters / local groups to look at for opportunities in Cyprus?

If anyone is based in Larnaca and open to a quick coffee while we’re there, I’d be happy to connect",1,1767896207.0,cyprus,1,1.0,False
1q7jc54,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeLonghi/comments/1q7jc54/delonghi_awful_refund_process/,DeLonghi awful refund process,"Hi all, I just wanted to share my experience with DeLonghi’s refund process.

First of all, the machine itself is great, I really like the coffee it makes.

I initially purchased the machine at full price from their website. About a week later, they ran a sale and the same machine was discounted by $200-$300. I contacted customer support via chat to see if they could credit me the difference, but they refused and suggested that I return the machine instead. I tried speaking with another agent, who only offered a partial refund. At that point, I decided to return the item.

DeLonghi does not provide any assistance with returns (for example, a return shipping label). You have to arrange and pay for shipping yourself, and there is no option to return the item in person. I ended up paying $30 for return shipping, which is fine.

It has now been 95 days since they received my return. I contacted them multiple times to ask for an ETA, but they seem to have no idea what is happening. Even when I provide my return ID, they still ask for the tracking number, which makes it seem like their system doesn’t clearly show whether they received the item or not.

Their explanation has been that it takes “one to two billing cycles” for the refund to appear, which is something I have never encountered before. They later added that it took them 30 days to process the return, meaning I would then have to wait another one to two billing cycles. However, after more than three months, I still have not received my refund.

And when contacting them today, via chat, they disconnected me 3 times (first 2 times was too many customer, 3rd time, the agent idle for too long).",1,1767896172.0,DeLonghi,0,1.0,False

1q7jaqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q7jaqy/the_apartment_that_smelled_like_death/,The Apartment That Smelled Like Death,"
I moved to New York three months ago. Got a job at a finance company. Typical 9 to 5. You know how it is.

I’m from Portland, Maine. Packed what I could fit in a suitcase and rented the cheapest place I could find. Sixth-floor walk-up. Tiny windows. No sunlight. Just a small apartment that smelled like dust and old paint. The kind of place you tell yourself, ""It’s just temporary,"" but you end up staying anyway. Because if you keep looking for other places to stay, the stress will end up eating youfrom inside out.

The first few weeks were normal. Boring. Wake up. Shower. Put on the same shirt. Coffee doesn't even taste like anything anymore. Go to the big office in the big city. Sit at my desk. Answer emails. Smile when people walk by. No one asks how I’m doing.

FaceTime with my girlfriend after work. She’s still in Maine. ""How’s the new place, love? Are you getting used to it?"" ""It’s fine."" ""You sound tired."" ""Doing my best. Still can’t grasp the concept of office work."" ""Don’t burn yourself out, okay?"" ""I’ll try.""

The apartment is small. It’s cold, even in summer. The walls don’t make any noise. Which was weird for New York, I guess. The smell of dust was getting heavier.

One day on my day off, I decided to clean the whole place. Mopped the floors. Scrubbed every corner. Got rid of all the dust. For a while, the air felt better.

But then came the smell of rot. I checked the fridge. Nothing rotten. No leaks. No mold. Then it went away.

At work, people started stepping back when I got in the elevator. At lunch, Mark left a bottle of deodorant on my desk. I asked him why. He didn’t answer. Just stared at the floor.

FaceTime again. ""Nick, you look pale."" ""Probably bad lighting. I feel fine."" ""Are you losing weight?"" ""I don’t know. Don’t have a scale in here."" ""Do I look like I’m losing weight?"" She bit her lip. ""Do you go outside?"" ""I go to work."" ""That’s not the same."" I looked at the screen, but I couldn’t answer. She started whimpering. I think she was crying, but the Wi-Fi cut out before I could be sure.

That night, I saw it for the first time. Long legs. It was hunched over because the ceiling was too low. It kind of looked like me trying to crawl near my bed—that damn incline near the roof floor.

I stared at it. It stared at me with its white eyes. I realized it had no feet. Just floating an inch off the ground. Neither of us moved. I was too scared to move.

Got up at 4:12 AM I couldn't sleep. The smell was gone. It was too. But my toothbrush tasted like blood. I checked my gums. They were fine.

At work, they stopped sitting near me. In the break room, someone said: ""Smells like he’s rotting."" I turned around, just to see them smiling at me.

FaceTime again. ""Nick?"" ""Yeah?"" ""Have you been sleeping?"" ""I don’t think so."" ""Are you… Feeling alive?"" ""I’m trying to be."" She didn’t answer.

It got closer. I could see it better. Its arms… they were a part of its chest. Folded in... no stitched there or melted shut. It was smiling. But its eyes were terrified. I drifted back to sleep. I was used to it being there by then. I woke up and it was by the bed. Still smiling. Still terrified. It whispered: ""Rot suits you.""

I stopped showering. I was feeling tired and I felt like it didn’t matter anymore. My arms felt heavy. Like they weren’t cooperating. I practiced moving my fingers in front of the mirror. They were slower.

After a few days, someone got fired at work. It was my fault. My mind was full. I don’t know what I was thinking. I remember it being like full static in my head. I misplaced some files and someone took the blame for it. I was sitting in the meeting room alone. My manager knocked but didn’t come in. ""You doing okay, bud?"" I didn't answer just nodded even without looking at him ""Good."" He left.

She called again. ""Nick, sniff your shirt."" I laughed. ""Please."" So I did. Rot. I smelled like death. I gagged. Almost puked but managed to hold it in. That was the first time I could smell it, really smell it. She paused. I tried to ask her, ""How did you know?"" But before I could finish, she said: ""I can smell it too.""

It stood by the bathroom door. When I brushed my teeth, I saw it behind me. Its voice was soft, like it was telling me a secret: ""You can't help."" It was right.

I couldn’t lift my arms today. They just hung there. Like useless flaps of meat. I opened my mouth in the mirror. There was something behind my teeth.

They moved my desk away from everyone else. I thought ""im surely getting fired soon."" Everyone gave me weird looks throught the day. Mark walks by but doesn’t look at me. I asked him how his day was. He didn’t even answer. Then he left.

I didn’t answer her call tonight. She left a voicemail. ""I saw you in my sleep today. You looked like you were smiling. But your eyes weren’t."" She told me to get out. Take a break. Call my parents. Find a therapist. But it was too late.

After hearing her message, I looked in the mirror. My eyes were whiter and my pupils were gone. Just like his. And i was smiling. But i couldn't feel it.

I tried to pack my bag. My fingers don’t close right anymore. He appeared behind me while I tried. His breath smelled like death. ""You .""

I don’t think this thing is a ghost. I think it’s me. Or at least, it’s what I am becoming.

I knew I was doing wrong. I knew I was letting everything rot—my life, my job, my relationship. I could’ve stopped. Even if people didn’t offer any help, I could’ve sought it. I didn’t. I kept going.

Now it’s closer than ever. I decided, fuck my stuff, I just need to get out of here. But I couldn’t leave. I mean that literally.

When I reached for the door, the smell hit me so hard I puked. My hands wouldn’t work right. Then I fell down. I heard my feet break. When I looked down, all I saw was a pool of blood and thousands of bone shrapnel trying to escape my skin and muscle tissue. But I don’t know if I can compare it to the pain of my teeth breaking from the inside out and rapidly rotting and cutting the insides of my mouth.

Nobody helps. They see you breaking, and they look away. That’s fair. I would’ve done the same. Back in Maine, my grandfather used to say: ""If you let rot sit long enough, it grows teeth."" Now I know what he meant.

If you’re reading this, don’t bother messaging me. I’m probably not here anymore. Or if I am, I’m not leaving this apartment. My fingers started to look like they’ve melted in acid while I’m typing this. The screen is all bloody. I can’t move my arms right. But I feel like I had to post this. All I want to say before I hit post or before I die is: I’m sorry. To myself.",1,1767896089.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1q7j7wd,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1q7j7wd/non_religious_lady_38f_met_a_new_super_religious/,Non religious lady (38F) met a new super religious friend (26M) and I need some help!,"I’m a non-denominational / agnostic woman in my 30s. About six months ago, I met a very kind 26-year-old Muslim man who immigrated to the U.S. around two years ago.

We clicked immediately over humor and daily life. At work he’s professional and reserved, but with me he was warm and playful, and we started teasing each other right away. Within a week we were sharing music, memes, stories, and talking regularly. Early on, he asked a few times to get coffee or go on walks, but since he was still a stranger I declined while remaining friendly when I saw him at work.

Once I felt more comfortable, I invited him to run errands with me. Early into that first outing, he very clearly and kindly explained how he views our relationship: as close friends, with specific boundaries tied to his faith. The only concrete requests were that we not drink alcohol or eat pork when together and he would handle the rest. He’s always explained these things calmly and checks in to make sure I don’t feel dismissed or uncomfortable.

He’s been open about his background: he comes from a wealthy family in a modern but very religious and culturally insular country. His social circle here consists of close male friends from his home city. He’s said his father encouraged him to move to the U.S. to experience more of the world, and he’s actively trying to balance curiosity, fun, and independence with staying within his religious values.

He’s introduced me to his friends simply as “my friend,” and everyone has been welcoming and respectful. I’ve been treated as a guest in their homes and businesses, which reassured me that warmth and hospitality can coexist with religious boundaries. In public situations (like restaurants), he prefers to handle things like ordering and paying, which we discussed openly and I’m fine with.

We are not romantically involved, but we are very close. We talk daily, run errands together, and spend time one-on-one. He loves to share his life with me from his home country, mostly because he is in a much different social status here and hasn't expanded his social life much. He’s shared that in the past, women associated with him in his home country faced real safety risks, which gives context to how seriously he takes boundaries. 

He's very vocal that's he's a virgin in every way and while our convos sometimes get spicy, his choice is to avoid intimacy as much as possible which I respect. 

One thing that has given me pause: he’s told me that after spending time with me, he sometimes performs ghusl (a ritual purification) because he feels that sharing time and attention with a woman he isn’t related to or married to requires spiritual accountability. We’ve held hands a few times which was deeply meaningful to him and we did engage in some sex adjacent activities a time or two. He was very intentional afterward about his religious process and felt at peace that he was managing his faith appropriately.

He’s extremely independent, and I don’t interfere with his beliefs. Still, we’re attached, and I’m unsure how to proceed in the healthiest way.

**My question:**
From a practical perspective, how can I support this friendship and spend time together without unintentionally pushing him into situations that conflict with his values? I know his religious choices are his responsibility, but I’d like to stay firmly in a “safe lane” and keep things as respectfulvas possible without creating guilt or pressure on either side. Which is difficult because he's extremely attractive and comfortable with me and finds me safe to experiment with which he expresses as us being ""best friends"". I'm fine with the relationship that we have right now and don't feel any need to introduce more than what we already have.

TL;DR:
I’m a non-religious woman in my 30s who’s close friends with a younger Muslim man new to the U.S. We spend a lot of time together, but his faith places limits on male-female interaction, and he sometimes feels the need to repent after seeing me. How do I maintain the special friendship without crossing lines or creating unnecessary guilt?

Does anyone notice an episode where one of the liars dresses outside their style that sticks out to you?

I am not good at describing different styles, but I think Aria has a somewhat artsy style. I can’t remember the episode, but the liars were in the coffee shop and Mike’s teammate had just started working there. He had dropped some dishes and Aria went over to help him. Aria was wearing a business casual (maybe that is what it’s called) type dress that was popular for that time, but to me seemed a little outside of her style. There was another episode where Emily was dressed at school like she was going for a corporate interview. It almost seemed more like something Hannah‘s mom would wear to work.

I know there are some times where the liars dress more casually like when Hannah was going through her first break up with Caleb or when Spencer was taking pills and she found out about Ezra. I also know that styles may change or evolve as the seasons go on, but we’re there any episodes where you noticed one of the liars seemed to dress outside their normal style, but the situation didn’t call for it or it seemed random?

Currently using a transdermal patch 0.0375 mg twice weekly (I can't remember when I down dosed) with great success. About 6 weeks ago I started having breast pain on the right and thought maybe I felt something. I already had my annual scheduled so I waited to discuss with my NP since I wasn't 100 percent positive as I have heterogeneously dense breast with multiple cysts. I saw her on 12/30/25 and she confirmed the ""mass"" so I had my mammogram and ultrasound today.

I did order new bras as most of mine are stretched out (the girls are on the smaller side).  I had intended to stay on HRT forever due to wonderful doctors and because my menopause symptoms were horrific (I started perimenopause around 39). My mom is 80 and still has symptoms but had to stop.

I did a little light reading that HRT can make can increase these cysts after menopause. So my question is has anyone with a similar story tried the Vitamin E and if so was it helpful or did you just deal with the discomfort and pain?

Hello everyone! My name is José, and as my post's title says, I'm 26 and live in Chicago, US! Lately, I have been looking for some more meaningful friendship connections, especially with other gay men. I'd love to find some local friends, but I'm absolutely open to friends from anywhere in the world.

A little about me:

I am Mexican and American (I have both passports!) and a total cat person. I have three cats and they mean the world to me. I love to read books about Latin American history, essays, philosophy, poetry, and I'm starting to get back into fiction after a long time of reading only ""boring"" books. I used to consider myself a writer. It's honestly been a long time since I wrote anything for pleasure, but I have started to write my first book!! I'm really happy and excited about that.

I also love movies! I love documentaries, dramas, comedies, horrors, basically anything. I love to drink coffee and try new foods. I also am completely obsessed with anything related to languages! I speak English and Spanish fluently, and French and Portuguese at a high level. I'm casually learning Greek, Dutch, and Russian, so please don't expect me to be able to say much of anything. I have also always wanted to learn German.

If any of this sounds like someone you'd like to be friends with, please send me a message! I promise to try my hardest at replying, but I can be a little slow to do so sometimes. So, let's connect and become friends! I'm really looking forward to chatting with you!",2,1767895774.0,gayfriendfinder,0,1.0,False

From personal experience, I know that many trans people (myself included) eschew clubs and bars as meeting spots. Not only are you subject to unwanted approaches by drunken guys, you are liable to be a target for someone who may harm you.

So, the best solution is finding places to meet that are both public and relatively safe. A coffee shop, a casual restaurant, possibly a park when the weather is nice.

All of which leads to the question of how to facilitate meet-ups between trans people.

That problem has always been top-of-mind for me, as I'd love to create a meeting space online for wary trans people. Our Discord server presents such an opportunity, I believe, as everyone there has been vetted before admittance to that group.

With that in mind, let me ask everyone here: How can we do that?

I know there are casual gatherings such as the weekly takeover of Vertex Roasters in Ypsi on weekends, and the organized meetings arranged by the T-Time group from Ann Arbor (which has a Discord server if you're interested in joining them.)

But what can WE do? As much as I'd like to head-up such meet-ups myself, my health is not good. I won't go into detail, but there are many days when I am barely ambulatory, so I'd be the wrong person to arrange an in-person meeting.

As always, I'll open this up to suggestions. What is needed are both designated places in which group members and meet one another, and someone who can make arrangements.

Is anyone here willing and able to do that? Preferably, we should have several group leaders in various places around Michigan. Not everyone lives within driving distance of Detroit, Ferndale, or Ann Arbor.

Please speak up if you have any ideas or are willing to get the ball rolling.

Last Tuesday morning we had our usual standup, and afterwards my coworker Jenna wasn't at her desk. Someone asked in the group chat if anyone had seen her, because she was supposed to be on a client call at 10. I had seen her earlier, she looked stressed and was holding her phone like it was buzzing every two seconds. In the kitchen, while I was pouring coffee and trying to wake up, another coworker, Mark, said, ""Where's Jenna, did she bail?"" and I said something like, ""Maybe she got pulled into a meeting with HR again."" I don't even know why I added the ""again"". It was like my mouth wanted to sound in-the-know for half a second. Jenna had mentioned weeks ago that she had a meeting with HR, but it was about updating some paperwork, not drama. I knew that, I just wanted to feel clever or relevant, which is such a gross thing to admit.

Anyway Mark laughed and said ""oh damn"" and that should've been the end of it. Except it wasn't. By lunch, people were whispering that Jenna was being written up. By the end of the day it had morphed into ""Jenna is on probation"" and then into ""Jenna is getting fired, like for real."" Someone even asked if she had done something with company data because they ""heard HR was involved."" All of this started from my dumb little sentence while I was half asleep and holding a paper cup. Jenna came back around 11 looking like she'd been crying. She kept her head down. Our manager pulled her into a conference room, then later I saw her sitting alone on the stairs by the emergency exit, staring at her phone like she couldn't breathe. I wanted to go up and say, hey, this is not true, I'm sorry, I said something stupid. But I didn't. I sat at my desk and pretended to work, refreshing a spreadsheet and feeling my stomach twist. The next day I overheard two people talking about how Jenna is ""always messing up"" and how ""HR doesn't just meet with you for nothing."" It made me mad because it's unfair, and also because I'm the one who basically handed them the ammo. Jenna has been quieter since then. She didn't join the team lunch on Friday, and she used to always come. Today she asked our manager in the open office, voice shaking, if she was ""in trouble"" and if people were saying things about her. The manager said something about ""just focus on your tasks"" which was not reassuring at all. I watched Jenna nod and blink hard and sit back down, and I swear I felt like I was watching myself push her under water.

The worst part is I could fix it, at least a little. I could say, yeah that was me, I said something careless, there is no HR drama, I messed up. But now it's been days, and it feels like if I speak up, I'm going to look like the biggest snake alive. I keep thinking about how easy it was for me to damage someone with one sentence, and how I've been choosing my own comfort over her reality ever since. I hate that I'm the kind of person who stays quiet when it matters. I keep replaying that moment in the kitchen, wishing I had just said, ""No idea, maybe she's on a call."" Instead I wanted to sound important for 3 seconds, and now Jenna is walking around like everyone is judging her. It sounds dramatic, but I can literally feel the guilt sitting in my chest when I open Slack and see her name pop up. She doesn't deserve this, and I did it, and I'm still doing it by staying silent.

we just hopped on her bike and started riding until we found somewhere cool to sleep. that didn’t take very long. 

We did some exploring to kill time and I ended up having cheese fries and chili, which was probably the best food I had this week! 

It was still pretty warm when we went to bed at around 9, it was pretty windy, but my hammock did a surprisingly good job at directing it above me, I was actually extremely warm most of the night.

My friend Evan on the other hand, decided not to bring his mat because he felt it was too warm earlier… he soon realized that was a mistake considering his hammock was more of a mesh material and didn’t keep out any of the wind. 

He ended up sleeping on the ground in a pile of wet leaves and managed to get maybe an hour of sleep. 

Woke up and had some coffee and headed back home.

1q7iz3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q7iz3w/i_manage_a_cafe_that_serves_the_odd_and/,I manage a cafe that serves the odd and supernatural | We have a new regular,"My name is Axel and I manage the Drowsy Spectre, a café positioned in a place that should get little business. Well, little human business, that is. It is always hard to tell at first if they are just travelers who wandered into the weirder places, or if they merely look the part. 

So when a new face comes walking through our doors– all smiles and bright, friendly eyes– I have to be on guard because I have an unreasonably long list of bad experiences in my three years working here.

\--------------------------------------

Bars and other coffee spots contend with regulars that have their list of unspoken rules; only eight cubes of ice in the cup or requiring you call out their instagram handle instead of their name. Don’t call that guy sir, don’t try to give this other person their change because it goes in the tip jar. People expect their individual rules to be remembered or, in some cases, learned without any instructions at all. Break them, and experience their small but temporary wrath.

At the Drowsy Spectre, our customers have rules too, only the punishment for breaking them is anything but small. From an annoying bald man whose camera chips away at the souls it captures to an overtly friendly giant that turns anyone who trusts it into soup; things do not go well for anyone when someone breaks the rules. Hell, one time the entire shop got thrown into thick darkness and we were almost condemned to the black for all eternity. 

Sadly, most of the rules that we have were written down at the hurt of others. I’ve added a few of my own rules to Selene’s list. She was the manager before me and had a much *longer* run. She’s gone though. Gone, along with the original staff I worked with when I started. All new faces for me and our turnover rate is so high that those faces are refreshed again and again. Right when I am starting to really get to know someone, maybe even trust them, something comes along and eats them. The worst thing is that the new hires don’t understand the weird rules half the time, or don’t believe in the consequences at all.

But our new regular was a fresh experience for all of us, even those with any sense of seniority. 

I pulled into the lot at sunset. The shop is only open at night– I know, weird for a café. I waited for everyone else to arrive, supervising their entry subtly through hellos and greetings, making sure none of them approached the candle saleswoman near our drive thru. Amber called out ambiguously, not using any names, trying her best to lure anyone over to either buy her candles or fall for one of her word tricks. Only once everyone was inside did I flip our open sign on right at 6:00pm. That wasn’t consistent– sometimes the rules changed and there was nothing to do but roll with the punches. 

Flipping the sign, however, is a matter of seconds and accuracy.

And with our opening came the spell that protected us from the things that stalked the woods and prowled the lengthening shadows of the highway outside. Until the shop closed in the morning, no one was allowed to leave unless express permission was given. I have methods to protect people out in the dark but those are not guaranteed and are extremely *temporary*.

Unfortunately the spell only keeps out those creatures that have violent intent without rules. Any other strange thing can enter freely so long as they have reasonable criteria to enter a violent state. Reasonably is defined absurdly loosely so, despite our protections, every new face that walks in makes my back stiffen.

Unlike Selene, I choose to remain on the floor and behind the bar during the majority of my shift. I was the first to see Smiles and knew from his face and his stiff walk that he was going to be trouble. Real trouble or supernatural, I could not guess, but no one with a demeanor like him is reasonable to deal with. I found myself *hoping* that he was some kind of supernatural creature.

“Hey there!” He chimed once he was across the threshold. The blonde kept that big smile on his face all the way to the counter where he planted himself in front of Carlie. “You got any new seasonal specials?”

It seemed he ran out of words because his mouth halted in a big, open jaw grin and stayed there. Both Carlie and I caught on quick; when it came to new supernatural customers, rules had to be picked up on fast. 

“Sure, on that menu behind me. It cycles through.”

“Wow! Wow! It looks amazing!” He gawked at everything but the menu, not bothering to read any ingredients. “I’ll take the seasonal special! A big one! Hot and with marshmallows, caramel drizzle, mocha drizzle, peppermint toppings, and extra whip cream.” He made sure to wait until Carlie had written it all down on a cup before adding. “I’ll have that in a mug!”

Typically compliance was a good rule of thumb around these things. “Okay, sure.” Carlie wrote the order on a slip of paper. 

Now we have a cash drawer with a POS system, but we hardly use it. Demanding something from the creatures we serve is a terrible idea. They understand the concept of commerce and comprehend that to get something you must trade equal value. Equal value, however, means vastly different things between the countless species of the strange and supernatural. 

Organs, hair, dirt, wood carvings, cursed objects, teeth, sayings, pieces of wisdom.

Or, in Smile’s case, a handshake.

He performed his robotic, stiff walk over to the bar to watch me make his drink. Smiles stared, living up to the name I’ve given him. Now we have a stiff rule not to share your name with anyone– coworker or customer– but we do wear nametags. The discovery of a name via text has yet to be dangerous amid our clientele. Eventually he leaned forward and read my name tag.  

“Axel?!” Smiles laughed, his eyes wide with awe. “My name is Axel too!”

His name was Smiles, he just didn’t know that. “That’ll make it easier to remember.” I tried an awkward laugh, not knowing how the creature intended to behave. Typically the hungry ones were actively looking for a slip up. They cast nets into the sea hoping one of us fish would wander in. 

It didn’t help that I was the only true human on staff. Often times I was the target, the best pick for a meal.

I highly doubted Smiles’ claim but didn’t contest it. He clicked his tongue and shook his head. “Wow. I’m your favorite customer then, right?”

Questions were as dangerous as they were awkward. The obvious, positive answers tended to make things go very badly. I’d say yes, enter some kind of unseen contract that would force me to follow Smiles around as his personal servant or skin and quarter myself so that he can eat. Or no– which would be rude– and being rude usually results in violent, sudden death.

The best practice was to dodge the question and pick up on any clues as to what sort of creature was being dealt with. “Favorite? We just met.”

“So no?”

“Not at all! I just haven’t had time to decide.”

“But I am not your favorite customer *right* now?”

“I don’t know, I have to think about it.”

“I really need you to answer. Like, actually say it.”

“That isn’t something that I can decide so easily.”

“I am into verbal confirmation.” He grinned wide, waiting patiently, no doubt confident that he had trapped me. I didn’t even know for certain that I was walking into a new rule and I was starting to get annoyed. “Just say that I am your favorite.”

Rather than saying anything, I just shrugged. 

Smiles began drinking his latte. “Thank you, Axel!” He said with a bit of a wink, as if our supposedly shared name was some kind of grand secret that bound us together. Smiles wandered the shop’s two lobbies, sipping his mug as he stopped to examine walls and chairs as if at some kind of museum. 

“What do you think?” I asked Carlie.

Everything about her suggested she was a normal person. Sometimes, however, things weren’t right. That was the way of the supernatural. Look for the things that didn’t match. Her right hand had only four fingers. That would change with beings like her. One day her eyes would be a different color, or one arm would be longer than the other.

But she was peaceful and she didn’t have rules. Those were the most basic of requirements for working at the Drowsy Spectre. Having supernatural types on staff saved my ass more than once.

“Oh, he’s weird.” She confirmed what I already knew. “Super weird.”

“Yeah but did you pick up on anything specific? Do you know what he is?”

“Judging by that whole name thing, he seems like a mimic, and a bad one at that. He wants you to say he is your favorite as confirmation that he is doing a good job mimicking.”

That made sense. “So he is a mimic, then?”

“Doubt it.”

“What?”

She shrugged. “He is *like* a mimic.”

We watched him wander around the store some more. Eventually he made for the door and I thought he was finally going to leave. Instead, we made eye contact and he halted. There was that stupid smile again! He marched over, mug in hand, and returned it with two thirds of his latte still remaining. I waited for him to do something but he just stood there, grinning!

Then came the song. He started singing See You Again, the one by Wiz Khalifa, but replaced friend with Axel. I had to suffer through the entire thing wondering if he intended on casting some kind of spell with the song but interrupting him seemed dangerous too.

Eventually he stopped, waiting for applause or some sort of approval. We just watched him silently until he gave me a wave. “See you, Axel.” He said with a wink.

He marched over to the door and halted. His hand wrapped around the handle but he just froze like a statue. We thought he was finally going to leave– an exciting prospect considering the shop would then be empty– but then he turned around with that grin even wider than before.

Smiles locked eyes with me and reached into his pocket. He started walking towards the front counter, passing it to where he could enter the bar area. From within his coat he produced a long dagger.

We’d broken a damn rule!

“Shit.” I managed before scrambling up onto the bar. Smiles got to our baked goods fridge and entered an area meant for employees only. Occasionally that rule would be enough to stop certain creatures but I was not so lucky. He slammed the knife down where my foot had been atop the bar, barely missing my shoe. 

Smiles wasted no time scaling the counter, chasing after me as I hurried around the shop. I entered the other lobby in a run, using the largest table as a shield between me and Smiles. He didn’t slow down, he just turned right and circled the table with infinite patience. We went around one another, spinning about the table, and Smiles had all the confidence of a hunter with a hare in a trap.  

It was hardly the first time something wanted to kill me but the pointed knife and the big grin put me into a panic I haven’t felt in years. I dashed backwards, throwing chairs aside to stop Smiles, hurrying back into the main lobby towards the front door. 

I didn’t see Tall Ben outside but rain made darkness thick outside. If I could get Smiles outside, I could double back and return. His violent intentions would halt him at the door! Tall Ben, however, was the most consistent hazard at the shop.

Risking worse things, I threw the door open and entered the cool, wet outside. 

Rain fell in sheets and masked whatever might’ve been hiding in the dark. I turned around to watch Smiles approach the door. He halted feet away from it. Grinning. Staring. Old, rusty knife stiff in his hand. 

I couldn’t go back in without him skewering me. I couldn’t stay outside without Tall Ben finally getting the one thing he always wanted; me, as a friend, and being a friend meant being squeezed and juiced into a jar for resale.

He wouldn’t be long. I had only anticipated being outside for a few seconds at most but it had been almost a minute already. No talisman, no protection in the dark, and fleeing wasn’t an option. Car or not, there was no safety outside the shop now that it was open. I *had* to get back inside!

I looked to my right. At our drive thru entrance, soaked in rain, sat the candle woman. Amber didn’t mind the pouring weather or the black. She stared at me, patiently waiting to see if I would come and check out what she had to offer. Amber *always* tried to beckon me over, to persuade me into talking to her. She hadn’t that morning, nor had she once I stepped outside. She knew something I did not.

She knew about Smiles.

Had she planned something?

I broke a rule. “Do you know what he is?!”

“What ever do you mean, Axel?”

He could hear her clearly over the storm. “The man inside! He has a knife and he’s going to kill me if I go back in.” I considered running away from him for the rest of the night but that would be exhausting. “Even if I get back in, he will just keep chasing me.”

Amber laid out her hands, displaying the tall candles she had on display. “Their light might seem dim, but I think if you bought one you might see a solution in the dark.” She looked over my shoulder and clapped. “Oh, goodie! Your friend is coming along.”

Tall Ben. I couldn’t see him in the dark but I believed her. “Amber, I am going to die if you don’t tell me. If I die, there is no more manager. No manager, no shop. No shop, no customers for you to harass!”

“Selene was the manager before you.” She snapped, her face turning sour. “There will be another.”

I looked back again. Tall Ben was peeking over a corner of the café but he wasn’t looking at me, not yet. “Amber, I–”

“–need to buy a candle.” She chided. “Buy one and I will tell you what that thing is and how to send him on his way.”

Again I looked back. There had to be another option! I didn’t know what buying a candle meant for me. Selene always stressed that it was the greatest rule. Immediate termination, no questions asked, which usually meant murder. I had to make a decision quickly. If I didn’t get back inside I was going to die. If I died, the shop wouldn’t close properly at dawn and that was bad for all his employees.

So I broke the most important rule of them all. “What does it cost?”

She picked one up, deciding which one was best for me. “I think you’ll find out. It is more fun that way.”

“Swear that, if I take one, you will tell me.”

She nodded, wiggling the candle. Things like her, like most of the creatures in the dark, are bound to their word. I just had to hope that a nod was enough. There was no time to argue, no time to play games with her, so I did what I never would have done were my old manager still in charge.

I took the candle.

“Oh, but we have to light it before you leave.”

“That wasn’t the deal.” I countered. “I have the candle and you agreed to tell me how to get rid of him!”

She lost her smile and, looking over my shoulder again, noted Tall Ben’s further curiosity. My fear was steadily growing; either go inside and inevitably be stabbed, or stay outside and by squished into meaty juice. 

“You know the old, classic vampire rule? They can’t enter unless they are invited in?”

I nodded vigorously. Why couldn’t Amber just spit it out?!

“Well, he’s the opposite. You’ve got to invite him to leave.”

What?! That made no sense! “Invite him to leave? How?!”

“Just tell him that he needs to leave and he will.”

I was certain that it wasn’t so simple. There is no way I broke the biggest rule over something so trivial. “And about him wanting to stab me? What about that?!”

“He can’t if you tell him to go. He can enter doorways, but he can’t leave them unless invited.”

I slammed the candle down on her desk and fled back towards the shop. Amber was laughing behind me, not a single care over the fact that I left what was mine behind. It didn’t matter, I knew that; I bought the candle and would soon discover why it was such a bad idea. I sprinted across the front of the store and that is where Tall Ben noticed me.

“What’s up my man!” He sounded like a normal person greeting a friend, but I knew far better. His form broke the shadow of the sky, stopping rain where he loomed. I did not know if he reached for me or not as I burst through the doors, leaping to the side when the reverse vampire– or whatever it was– lunged for me with the knife. 

He immediately tried another swipe.

“Leave! You have to leave!” I scrambled backwards. “Goobye, Axel!”

Telling him to leave and acknowledging the name he claimed caused Smiley to halt. “See you later, Axel!” He chimed and waved as he left. Tall Ben paid him no mind as he strolled off into the darkness at a stiff pace.

What the hell?! A reverse vampire makes no sense! What, was he going to put blood in me? Does he love garlic? I genuinely don’t even know how that could possibly work. 

Carlie hadn’t seen what I did, Amber was out of sight, but she had fetched a knife which she held in a four-fingered hand. “Is he gone for good?”

Our kitchen employee for the day arrived too. Jessie had a big, metal bowl held over her head. “And are you… you?”

“Yes, and yes.” I got to my feet, shaking. Despite all my time at the Drowsy Spectre, it wasn’t often I came that close to mundane death. Sure, it would be at the hands of the supernatural, but after everything a knife seemed a rather dull way to go. “He should be gone.”

“So we just had to ask it to leave the whole time?” Carlie threw up her arms. “That’s it?”

“I guess.” None of them read these stories. They wouldn’t know what I did outside and they don’t need to know. I had a bad feeling that things were going to go very poorly for me thanks to my purchase. Richard owns the place and I should probably reach out to him about it. I don’t know if he is familiar with Amber at all, or if he even knows our list of rules seeing as he never comes to the shop. I don’t have anyone else to ask about it. Can’t contact Selene– she’s gone. Some of my old coworkers that were here before I started might’ve known but I don’t even know if they are alive anymore.

Even if they are, there would be no way to contact them. It was different, riding it alone. Sure, I had employees to manage, but they didn’t know half of what was going on. Just six months ago Tall Ben managed to get someone out the drive thru window. A year ago, Lucas got taken by the Backdoor Thing. 

And I’d never admit it to them, but I know nearly as little as they do. Instinct made up most of my reality and it wasn't as if I had solid intuition, otherwise it wouldn’t have taken Amber’s help to figure out Smiley. 

I’ve always found trouble sleeping during the day– our night shifts require it– but it was even harder once I got home. The candle was sitting on my dresser, waiting to be lit. I passed it by and tried to keep my eyes shut tight. My very first day, years ago, I was told never to buy anything from Amber. Wasn’t even supposed to talk to her at all. Now the words of my predecessor haunted me. No, I am not afraid of being fired. It is worse than that. I know what the others don’t.

I know the threat of firing is a lie, and a mask to dissuade people from breaking rules which have consequences that are so much worse.

I have been on keto for over 3 months now, after hearing about it for years. Decided it was the best way to go to address some elevated liver markers and bad dyslipidemia (both presumably caused by insulin resistance and low muscle mass).

The other day I was getting pretty tired after a long day and about to go to bed. I was craving coffee though so I had a shot of espresso. I then got ready for bed.

Lo and behold, I was soon wide awake. And up until 3 am! I now notice that when I drink coffee, I get perked up. It works!

1q7iutq,https://i.redd.it/kdoeoxc206cg1.jpeg,AIO - ghosting best friend of 10 years,"I (23F) was best friends with Kelly (23F) for 10 years. In June 2025 we went on a girls’ holiday to Ibiza. She invited her work colleague Ellie (28F), who I’d never met. After the first day, Kelly and Ellie started excluding me such as exchanging looks, texting each other while I was there, disappearing for “private talks,” and making comments like “two besties on holiday” and “every blonde needs her brunette.” I could tell these comments were made to upset and exclude me.

When I raised it after the trip, Kelly denied every of these things happened and that they both love me. Kelly said I was just paranoid from drinking/lack of sleep. I ended up apologising.

Months later Kelly fell out with Ellie and admitted Ellie never liked me, rated me a “7/10,” and questioned why I was even invited. Kelly then backtracked and said Ellie was weird towards me in Ibiza but it “wasn’t her fault.”  And she “can’t control other people’s actions”. This confirmed I’d been gaslit.

Around the same time, Kelly repeatedly lied about seeing Jack, who was someone I’d had a one-night stand with years earlier. I told her I didn’t care if they were seeing each other, I just didn’t want to be lied to. She denied it multiple times, got offended, and accused me of not trusting her. It later came out she was seeing him and had told mutual friends not to mention it to me.

In October 2025, I travelled over an hour on the train to spend the day with Kelly. We met for 45 minutes to get a coffee, then she said she’d double booked and left to go to the gym with Ellie, leaving me alone in the cafe and to get the train home.

That was my final straw. I removed her on everything without saying anything. Since then, Kelly and mutual friends have messaged saying I’m overreacting. I have received this text today. ",4,1767895190.0,AmIOverreacting,7,1.0,False

We just made a large amount of typical, inexpensive lunch bags to give to people in Downtown Toronto. We went to McDonald's after, this was with our youth program via the church nearly two decades earlier. 

If I was back in Downtown Toronto, and a homeless man had asked for money, 99% of people would give absolutely nothing, leaving maybe 1% that would give a dollar or two. 

I don't really like the idea of just giving a bunch of homeless people any domination of money, as we all know where it's most likely going to go (beer, weed or cigarettes?) 

However something like making a bunch of frugal-sandwiches yourself at a low cost, like simple ham and cheese sandwiches with some smaller snack items, then give them to people in need. 

I think making food items for homeless is a really generous thing to do for society, and at a much cheaper cost vs takeout places today, when people don't necessarily have a kitchen themselves to eat at. 

If there was a guy with a guitar, playing music that I thought was actually pretty decent, then sure I'd be generous enough to get him a coffee or even better give him a decent sandwich. 

That's kind of like what I feel we need more of in our society, especially in the major Big apples like such as Toronto or New York City. Chicago, Montreal in Los Angeles also have these problems.

This is a systems fact, not a political opinion.

When narratives polarize toward extremes, variance increases.
Variance breaks planning.
Broken planning breaks institutions.

Extremes simplify reality to maintain momentum.
Reality does not simplify back.

STEVE:

If the government finances that company, public risk inherits private volatility.

Right now I will drink a very small diet coke in the morning and only after I have had breakfast and the issue is somewhat solved, but if I were to throw off the routine, diet coke before food in the morninf for example, it will cause some sensitivity. I fully understand that caffeine is a diuretic, but I have consumed it most of my life without consequence; what I am experiencing now is beyond what is normal for me.

**Rating:** 7/10
**Review:** It’s a loud piece. The colors on the crosses are vibrant, and the mesh quality is standard—breathable and decent for hot weather. However, the print on the foam front feels a little plasticky, like it might crack or peel after a summer of wear. The silver button on top is a nice detail, but overall it feels a bit lightweight compared to other CH caps I’ve handled.
**Fit:** Standard snapback fit. Sits a bit high on the head.

### **2. New Era NY Yankees Fitted (Side Patch)**

**Rating:** 9/10
**Review:** Can’t go wrong with a classic. The embroidery on the NY logo and the side patch is super clean—no loose threads or connected stitching. The brim came with a standard flat shape but curved easily. The wool blend feels structured and durable. Not much to complain about here, it does exactly what it's supposed to do.
**Fit:** True to size. Fits my head shape perfectly without pinching.

### **3. Nike Tech Fleece Jacket (Grey/Black)**

**Rating:** 8/10
**Review:** The color blocking on this is sick, gives it a more aggressive look than the solid grey ones. Material is smooth and comfortable, standard Tech Fleece quality. My only gripe is the main zipper; it feels a little stiff and catches slightly near the bottom. Hopefully, it loosens up with wear.
**Fit:** Fits slim. At 180cm, the Medium is a perfect fitted look, but if you want to layer a hoodie underneath, you might struggle. Length is spot on.

### **4. Chrome Hearts Black Tonal Cross Jeans**

**Rating:** 8.5/10
**Review:** These are way more wearable than the blue ones (see #6). The black-on-black patches are subtle and the leather crosses feel decent quality. The denim itself is heavy and rigid, which I like. The buttonhole was incredibly tight, had to fight it to get them open the first time. The wash looks authentic.
**Fit:** Waist is TTS. The length stacks nicely on my Jordans without dragging on the floor.

### **5. Supreme Box Logo Hoodie (Black)**

**Rating:** 7.5/10
**Review:** The blank on this is heavy and stiff—definitely a winter hoodie. The box logo embroidery is centered and straight, no floating 'e'. However, the neck hole is surprisingly tight/small. It’s a struggle to get my head through without messing up my hair. It’s a classic piece, but the comfort isn’t 10/10 due to the stiffness.
**Fit:** Boxy fit. Sleeves are a tiny bit short for my arms (180cm), but the chest is roomy.

### **6. Chrome Hearts Blue Patch Jeans**

**Rating:** 5/10
**Review:** Honestly, not feeling these as much in hand. The craftsmanship is fine, but the design is just too loud in person. The ""CHROME HEARTS"" text across the back is huge and the blue leather patches contrast too much for daily wear. The denim feels slightly thinner than the black pair (#4) as well. Hard to style without looking like a walking billboard.
**Fit:** Fits same as the black pair, straight leg cut.

### **7. Stussy Dice Knit Sweater**

**Rating:** 9.5/10
**Review:** Favorite item of the haul. The knit is surprisingly soft and not itchy at all against bare skin. The dice graphic is woven in clearly, not just printed on top. It has a nice weight to it and drapes really well. Feels like a quality garment that will last a long time.
**Fit:** Slightly oversized/relaxed. The perfect baggy fit for my build.

### **8. Amiri ""Imagination"" Hoodie**

**Rating:** 6/10
**Review:** A bit disappointed with this one. For an ""Amiri"" piece, the blank feels kinda thin and flimsy compared to the Supreme or Carhartt hoodies. The print is okay, but it feels like it might fade after a few washes. It looks cool, but the quality doesn't match the aesthetic. It feels more like a fast-fashion hoodie than a luxury rep.
**Fit:** Fits slightly cropped and wide.

### **9. Carhartt WIP Embroidered Hoodie (Cream)**

**Rating:** 10/10
**Review:** Best bang for your buck. The cream color is beautiful in person (though I’m terrified of spilling coffee on it). The ""Carhartt"" embroidery is thick and premium. The fleece lining is super soft. It’s simple, clean, and feels indestructible.
**Fit:** TTS. Not too boxy, not too slim. Sleeves hit perfectly at the wrist.

### **10. Stussy Arch Logo Hoodie (Black/Yellow)**

**Rating:** 8.5/10
**Review:** Another solid Stussy piece. The yellow text pops really nicely against the black. The logo is a chenille-style texture which adds some nice depth. It’s a good daily driver hoodie. Cuffs are nice and tight, holding the sleeves up well.
**Fit:** Fits similar to the Carhartt one, maybe a little looser in the chest area. Ideal for a relaxed street fit.

Context: I work daily at a coffee shop. I’m there about 6-8 hours a day, six days a week. The shop has a bunch of  upholstery furniture. Out of basic precaution (I live in NY), I only sit at a table away from the wall. The chair is smooth metal, the  table ‘stand’ is too. I am good about keeping my bag zipped and it and my coat hung on the chair. 

My partner, however, has on occasion worked on one of the couches, and typically works at a table against the wall for the outlet. 

I don’t utilize good practice at home, though, as I often place my bag on my couch or armchair when I get home… 

Definitely think the possibility is minimal, but want to be vigilant about heading any bugs taking up residence in my home.

1q7ilyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/1q7ilyl/contract_ended_this_week_and_didnt_end_well/,Contract ended this week and didn’t end well,"For context- I have been with this family for almost a year and a half. Our contract ended this week and they are putting NK in an intimate daycare setting starting next week. Everything has been fine up until this week. Literally no issues, I’m never late, I’ve called in sick 1 time ever, I’ve cared for NK through so many illnesses etc. and have always gone above and beyond for their family. 

I got to work on Monday and noticed his eye was bright red. He had pink eye and they didn’t think it was important to tell me. I finished the day and they assumed I would finish out the week. I texted them that evening to let them know that I unfortunately cannot afford to catch pink eye (I start with a new family next week with a 2 month old baby). But regardless, I wouldn’t feel comfortable caring for him with pink eye because I know how highly contagious it is and it’s impossible for a toddler to understand the importance of not touching his eyes and washing hands regularly etc (he just turned 2). 

The way this family gaslit me into saying it’s not contagious and acting like I was crazy for even suggesting not caring for him through it, was wild. They even sent me an article that they must have searched high and low for, stating that a caregiver should still watch kid because it’s no more contagious than a common cold. I politely stood my ground and countered with an article from the CDC that highlighted just how contagious it is etc. This was our first time ever not being in agreement over something. They’re used to me being a “yes” person bc I am a people pleaser to the point of allowing people to take advantage of me. 

Anyway, with all of that said, they were rude and so cold for our ending. I had told them that I was sad and sorry that things are ending this way, as I was really looking forward to me last week with NK and sad that it was cut short. They waited until the next day to respond with:
 “Sent over your final payment. We are disappointed in how this is ending as well. We certainly have different views about this which is fine and we respect your perspective. 

Where we do feel let down was how your communication came off as pushy and your medical diagnoses was unsolicited. We feel that a boundary was crossed and we didn’t appreciate it.”

I went back and read my responses and none of it was pushy or unsolicited diagnoses etc. I was simply stating that I didn’t feel comfortable and why. And that is the end to our journey. Not a single thank you in sight for taking extraordinary care of their child for almost a year and a half. Just letting me know they’re pissed at me (unjustly imo). I’m just shocked and heartbroken by all of it as I have never had a family treat me this way when the contract ends… ever. I’m still in contact will all of my former families, even from 20+ years ago. 

I replied once I stopped crying and got my emotions in check, about how deeply hurt I am that there has been no acknowledgment or appreciation expressed for the care, dedication, and effort I consistently gave NK and their family, and that I had hoped that even amid disagreement, that commitment could have been recognized. And that ending this chapter without so much as a thank you reinforces a feeling of being undervalued and unappreciated, and it's a very painful way to end things. I also apologized if they felt I was pushy in my responses bc that wasn’t my intention, and then wished NK and their family well. No response, shocker. 

Anyway, if you made it this far, thank you for reading. I’m just so so sad by all of it, and feel so disrespected after all I have done for them, but good riddance I guess. I knew they didn’t value or appreciate me, but this just kind of reinforced that feeling, which is why I added that part in my response. Over the course of being with their family, not once have they told me merry Christmas, acknowledged my birthday, didn’t acknowledge my 1 year anniversary with them, have never given me even so much as a nice hand written card expressing any gratitude during any holidays or birthday or anniversary. Certainly no bonuses, ever. Consistently brought home food, coffee, treats… never offered to get me anything. So I don’t know why I expected this to be any different, but a simple “thank you for everything over this past year and a half” would have gone a long way. Because now I’m just pissed and so hurt and feel so unappreciated. Anyway now I’m just rambling but thank you for listening!",4,1767894671.0,Nanny,4,1.0,False

Everywhere you go now coffee shops, takeout counters, bakeries, fast food the payment screen flips around and asks for 18%, 22%, or even 30%. Sometimes this happens before you even get your order. No table service. No extra effort. Just pressure.
Prices are already high. Taxes are high. Rent, groceries, gas everything costs more. Yet somehow customers are expected to make up for low wages while businesses quietly step back from responsibility.

I get it workers deserve fair pay. But why is that burden pushed onto customers instead of employers? And why has tipping shifted from a voluntary thank-you to something that feels mandatory?
At this point, it feels less like appreciation and more like guilt built into a touchscreen.
Questions for discussion:
Should tipping be limited to full service only?
Should Canada move to higher wages and no tips, like some countries?
Or is tipping still necessary in today’s economy?

They're both well reviewed, highly praised options I've seen people speak highly of on this page. I researched for weeks, watched reviews vids, read up, and tracked sales. I found great deals on both and one is getting returned. I kept all the original packaging and have been very careful with each one. Hopefully, someone will get a nice open box deal and I get to pick the best option for our use case! 

Specs: Legion Pro 7 16IAX10H OLED 16"" Gaming Laptop Computer - Eclipse Black; Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX 2.1GHz Processor; NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 12GB GDDR7; 32GB DDR5-6400 RAM; 2x 1TB Solid State Drive; Microsoft Windows 11 Pro; 2.5GbE LAN; 2x2 Wi-Fi 7 802.11be+Bluetooth 5.4; 16"" WQXGA OLED Low Blue Light 240Hz Glossy Display

HP OMEN MAX 16-ak0003nr 16"" Gaming Laptop Computer - Shadow Black AluminumAMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 375 (2.0GHz) Processor; NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 16GB GDDR7; 32GB DDR5-5600 RAM; 1TB Solid State Drive; IPS display

I've had them for two days, run Battlefield & Cyberpunk on both a day after getting them to compare frames and I'm getting issues with both a day later. This was supposed to be a fun side by side comparison. My wife is out of town and has been missing playing battlefield when traveling so I thought one of these would win out and be a nice final holiday gift for her when she's stuck on work trips or when we travel together. Neither of us has gotten a laptop in years so it's got other uses too. We usually play battlefield side by side on the couch on a ps5 pro/samsung 65"" S90C and ps5 standard/32"" samsung g7 odyssey. 

The Legion had an Intel driver update it said was required to boot battlefield so I ran it midday yesterday. As soon as the driver update was complete, the Nvidia GPU disappeared as a graphics device. I nearly went through running DDU but checked device manager first, reveal hidden devices, and the 5070ti came back online. Ran Nvidia app, played with some settings and was able to play. Later in the day, I rebooted it and the Nvidia GPU disappeared again. I tried the device manager workaround and that didn't work. I gave up and went to bed later on. Any help is appreciated and my next step would be to boot in safe mode and run DDU and see if that works. If it doesn't, I'll just reset to factory and hope a total wipe fixes it. Is that a sane path to take or is there something simple I'm missing? 

The Omen Max 16 ran Cyberpunk at insane frames (stated 300+ with dlss on 4x on the game bar frame counter which doesn't even matter bc the internal display is 240 hz, still impressive though) and ultra settings on its own display on Tuesday. Got a bit hot but that's expected and I cranked the fans to max, elevated it off the desk, and it worked well. My buddy was over and played through about two hours of a fresh Cyberpunk run which was fun. Ran a similar test with the Legion sitting on the couch beside him to compare. Slightly lower frames by about 20ish compared to the Omen but the OLED display popped compared to the IPS in the Omen. I'll be using either one at home as a ps5 replacement and the laptop screen when traveling. VRAM was nearly max on both Battlefield and Cyberpunk for the Legion and the Omen had plenty of space on both. CPU was maxed for both on Battlefield. I read it was a CPU heavy game but damn! Cyberpunk was nowhere near it. 

I've got a Samsung g7 (G70D) odyssey 32"" on the coffee table that my wife and I trade off using and a ps5 pro and Samsung S90C mounted on the wall so we can play side by side. The G7 monitor had flickering issues when in use with the Omen and Legion. I tried turning off all cranked settings on each laptop like HDR, reducing frame rate down to 120 and even 60, and I got a little more stability but still some flickering every 15 seconds or so. I'm not sure what's causing it but maybe it's something with the Samsung OS bc it's a ""smart"" monitor that's basically a mini-me of the TV I've got. I tried switching to DP from the higher end HDMI cable but no improvement. I don't think it's the cable but might be a monitor problem? I have a Dell 32"" Dell 32 4K UHD Gaming Monitor G3223Q at my desk that isn't as ""smart"" but haven't tested either laptop on it yet bc I'm dealing with issues with both. Maybe that's the workaround but I'm still wondering why Odyssey is struggling with both of these. 

Yesterday evening, I was in the Nvidia app on the Omen, saw there was a DLSS 4.5 update so I ran it, booted back into Cyberpunk and tried running on same mostly max settings on the Omen from a day before that had worked like a charm. It was sluggish as hell, hot, and unplayable. I tried scaling the settings back, dropped FPS/DLSS, reduced resolution, and it wouldn't improve. I rebooted and tried again and got the same issue. 

I'm not a tech whiz but I'm capable of following instructions and taking my time to do thorough searches for fixes. I'm stumped on the Omen and now I've got two brand new laptops I'm trying to compare side by side that won't run a damn thing that they both previously ran well. Part of me is tempted to factory reset both but don't know if it's worth wasting the time if there's simpler fixes.

My wife gets back this evening so I'll have some time after work to tinker but curious if anyone has any recs. These are both in the 15 day return window from Microcenter. The Legion was an open box deal they took $200 off. When I opened it, I saw a big dent in the top outer casing and took pics/video. Not sure if $200 is enough compensation for an open box that has a pretty decent cosmetic issue so curious if I should ask for more (anyone have experience with this?). Legion was $1699 before tax, Omen Max was $1799 before tax.

Sorry for the novel but wanted to give clear insight into what I've tried and device info. Any help or recs on how to proceed are greatly appreciated! I could have Micro Center look at some of this, probably for a fee, but it is a learning experience for me and I'll keep one of these so I'd like to solve it myself (with community help 😀)!",1,1767894634.0,GamingLaptops,0,1.0,False

Tired of typing SMS verification codes every single time you log in on your Windows PC?  
My dad and I were too, so we built a fix.

🚀 **Introducing CodeClip**  
The first app that automatically forwards SMS verification codes from your iPhone and puts them straight into your **Windows clipboard**.  
Small idea. **Huge time-saver.**

✨ **How it works**

1. You receive an SMS verification code on your iPhone.
2. Press **CTRL + V** on your Windows PC.
3. That’s it. Simple, right?

🔒 **How safe is it?**  
CodeClip uses iOS Shortcuts and a lightweight app on both your phone and computer to create a secure bridge between the two.

* When you receive an SMS verification code on your iPhone, a Shortcut automation is triggered.
* The message is processed **entirely on-device**: everything is stripped out except the verification code.
* The code is then **encrypted**, sent through our server, and placed directly into your Windows clipboard via the desktop app.
* Our servers only ever see the **encrypted code** (which we can’t decrypt).
* No accounts. No phone numbers. No emails. Everything stays anonymous.

🎁 **Pricing**  
We offer a **7-day free trial** so you can try it risk-free.  
After that, it’s **$24.99/year** (that’s less than a coffee per month ☕).

We met on TikTok, and we live in the same country but far apart. We plan to meet during vacation.

When we first started dating, he made it clear he didn’t want to introduce me to his friends or post about me online. I don’t mind not being posted, but I do want his friends to know me. I noticed he has more female friends than male friends, but they all went to the same high school.

Recently, he asked if he could hang out with a female friend. At first, I didn’t act jealous, even though I felt upset—she doesn’t know me and doesn’t know he’s dating someone. I told him it was okay.

Now, he asked the same thing again right after a huge argument we had the day before. This morning at 5 a.m., he asked if he could go out alone with her for coffee. He didn’t tell me directly at first; he just said he was going out and would be back late. When I asked why, he said he always does this with his mom to see if she’ll let him.

I felt stupid, so I told him it’s not my business and that going back late isn’t a big deal. He said “cool,” and he knows I’m upset. I don’t want to be controlling, but I’m uncomfortable. I even stopped seeing my male friends for him, though I’m not asking for the same treatment. I just want him to introduce me to his friends. He says when he travels next year, he’ll drop all his female friends—that’s his usual excuse.

I’m in a 5-month long-distance relationship (18/F with 19/M). My boyfriend wants to hang out alone with a female friend who doesn’t know about me.

**6:42 AM.**

Today I woke up with a dry mouth and that state where the brain processes that it was a dream, today the dream was the same as since January 8th: clicky voices, the deep smell of salt and one of them with that strange look calling me something that involved being hot.


I turned the TV on at maximum volume, and while I brushed my teeth I listened to the journalist.


“...and so, for the third consecutive week, the rate of adherence to the Tiamat enzyme exceeds 89% in all Integration Zones! Humanity is reborn! Since January 8th of this year, human life has changed forever, an alien species landed on Earth seeking shelter, we gave ourselves and in return they helped us with everything, starting with dissolving all current governments and then cur-.”

Isabel grumbled from the top bunk and threw a pillow in my direction, and I grumbled, grabbing the remote and turning off the TV.


— “Damn it, Sebas! * Turn that off, please!”


She sat up, her black hair messy, her eyes still swollen but with that soft glow that only appears after someone takes the enzyme possesses. Isabel Morales, 24, from Oaxaca. It arrived three days before the Ark entered orbit. Now, it shares with me a ""temporary human enclosure,"" as the Thalassari call it with that chilling delicacy.

— “Grab the enzyme already, man.”


she said, rubbing her eyes.

“You look like a ghost. And I don’t want to be the only one with a green badge in this hole.”

She craned her neck. The badge glowed a radioactive green, the kind you see in a child’s drawing.

""Trusted Human.""
Written in large letters, meaningful enough for a human to understand and alien enough for a Thala to understand.

— “Not mandatory… for now,” I said, stirring my cold coffee.


— “It’s not, but it’s intelligent. My aunt in Chiapas is alive again. Sebas, she had a disease that I don’t even know how to pronounce for two years, and now she’s planting corn with her own hands because a **Guardian** passed by and cured everyone in the community without charging, see-without… without asking for anything! They just set up camp there.”

Guardian — that’s how the Thalassari referred to themselves now. Never “commanders.” Never “lords.” Always “guardians,” as if we had already agreed that we needed to be guarded and protected.


— “They ask,” I murmured, finishing my cold coffee. “They just don’t charge in money.”


She looked deep into my eyes with those two pearls that each day became more like hers. Not with anger, with pity.


— “You're seeing malice in genuine kindness, man. Take the enzyme at least to stop dreaming about the bottom of the sea that you've been in ever since the Thala arrived.”

**8:07 AM.**

I left the premises.


The city where tourists from New York always came to spend the night is now called ""Vermara,"" a name chosen in homage to ""Verm'ara,"" the legendary City of Singing Corals, destroyed in the Great Betrayal: an event that, from what I understand, resulted in the near extinction and flight to land of these fish-like people.


The streets are clean, without a single dirty, poorly lit alley, but what bothers me most is the silence. There are no screams, no loud music, only the sounds of Thala doing strange things inside the barges, a deep, guttural sound that makes my chest vibrate.


I pass by a mixed couple: a Thala in a gray uniform and a human woman with phosphorescent green eyes. The Thala holds her hand carefully, as if afraid of crushing it, and whether or not that could happen, poor politician from the East who thought he could insult one of these monsters and get away with it. His hand turned to dust in a handshake that was ""accidentally too strong.""

She smiles, tilts her head… but it doesn't seem natural, I mean, what in this world seems natural after the arrival of the Thala?


They've been here for three and a half weeks. Nobody here is really in love, just learning to pretend.
And that's when I realized something funny: you couldn't tell if it was male or female: Even from behind, even with the tight uniform.

Muscular body, long tail, firm and voluminous chest... Everything the same in everyone, because from what I understood in the books they gave out as if they were pamphlets for a ball, the reason for this is that they evolved to completely share the role of creation, taking away the fact of conceiving, that is, they don't have, in the human sense, the definition of woman and man.

The only part that might be what you do to differentiate them is their eyes; they were different, the colors are always warm or cool, perhaps a way to differentiate them.


**9:18 AM.**

I get close to the old industrial district, partially demolished, to get in touch with the nearby ocean; it's now ""Maritime Zone 23"".

This is where the Thalassari set up their ""logistical support"" camp – tents made of living coral. I've never seen one before; it's basically a thin coral that looks like a tent-shaped fabric. Now, put beings 5 ​​to 6 meters tall inside, and there you have one of their tents. The Thalassari circulated with relaxed postures and clothes that were theoretically casual but looked like just the clothes soldiers wear underneath the universe. Everything about them indicated civilians; after all, they didn't make any distinction when going to look for the ""Ark."" What makes me wonder is the eyes always scanning the surroundings.


I hide behind a container marked with the Ark's symbol – a spiral with eyes. I don't know why I was here, but since I was, I would satisfy my curiosity and maybe end my paranoia, or just reinforce it. Regardless, it will be interesting.


Amidst the heavy material carrying orders in their language, that's when I hear...

Not everything.

Just fragments.

As if the wind were choosing what I can let it hear.


“...Zone 23 still resists. Greater... refusal of the continent's enzyme.”

“...no... force... Council forbade.”

“...then that... Release... Therak... ancient sewer... ""Environmental accident""...”
“...Begging for protection... protection... tastes like calm.”

They stop when a sound of water crashing against the earth is heard, as if one of them had arrived and this one also seems to conspire
""...after they accept the bond... They never... thought alone.”*

My blood ran cold.


Zone 23 was... My neighborhood! Okay, calm down. None of this makes complete sense, but it's enough to make my stomach churn.


Because now I know: I was right, they had ulterior motives, they are evil! But... Regardless of who I tell, I wouldn't change a thing.


I stand still for so long that I almost don't notice when I turn around. You know, their skin, being basically sharks, is colder than human skin, around 20 degrees Celsius with lower sensations. And why am I talking about this? Simple, I didn't notice the cold spreading, and while I was preparing to move, my shoulder hits something that doesn't give way, cold as wet steel, hard as living stone. Before I can move away, a hand grabs me by the neck. It doesn't squeeze. It just... prevents it, and that alone makes it seem worse. And then, a voice as low as the bottom of the sea speaks as if it were a lieutenant giving orders to a Brazilian soldier, reverberating within me:


""You, human, what are you doing here, listening to conversations between soldiers? Have you lost your mind?""

Happy new year and I’m wishing you all the best from my part of the world!

I need some general advice on how to handle this situation. I’ll include my recent post below for context but wanted to get some help if possible.

I’ve noticed my ex wanting to talk with me as of recently but I’ve basically went grey rock since our divorce was finalized in November. Kept it about the kids/emergencies only, nothing more.

Fast forward to this past week and she started texting me more about the kids and would randomly sneak in “I hope you have a good day” or “I hope your doing good” then would unsend messages. I casually said “thanks you too” not thinking anything of it and she immediately asked me if I wanted to grab lunch or a coffee next week. 

I’m assuming it’s just bad news but I don’t know for sure, should I entertain the idea of meeting up to be friendly or reject her offer? I’m past the emotional side of everything and I’m in a good headspace but I don’t know if it’s worth it, you know?

Please let me know if you have gone through this yourself. I appreciate all of your time!

\-TOR Maple Leafs v PHI Flyers Over 6.0 (-110) | 0.5 Units



The last two meetings between these squads cashed the Over with ease, friends. In addition, Toronto has cashed the Over in 2 of their last 3 outings, while Philadelphia’s last 4 straight games have seen at least 6 goals. I don’t doubt a high-scoring affair here, especially with today’s underdog having put at least 3 goals on the board in all of their last 4 games (yes, the Maple Leafs are the dog today!) My money’s on the Over to hit.

Throw away because I don’t know if any them use Reddit. 

This is gonna be a long one .

My family is traditionally Caribbean and family always comes first . 

I was raised in a household with my grandmother along with my cousins so we function like siblings.

My older Girl cousin got has some tendencies to make things all about her . We have had many a fights over the years . A few examples 

Telling me I wouldn’t be where I was if her mom never helped me go to school (then leaving me alone in another country that I don’t know while she had coffee with her friend ignoring me).

Traveled back home together with her and her friends and her man and she ignored me half the trip 

Making food for everyone in the house but me but then acting oblivious like she never ment to do it.

We flew to our home country to do some wedding planning for her and she texted her man about how Much she had to walk on egg shells around me and how I always ruin her vybe and if she could drive she could take my dads car and drive ( I flew down specifically to help her and borrowed my dads car to drive her around the island) . 

Then proceeded to get mad at me that i wasn’t inside the salon with her the enter time she was getting her hair done and her make up done . ( I had stepped outside because my friend who had not seen me in a year stopped by) .

Her wedding was a year later and she bearly spoke to me after the trip. She then would only message me when she needed me to do something or a pay for something for her wedding. I tried to clear the air about the trip and we both admitted where we went wrong even though I don’t think I did anything incorrectly and apologize. Thinking that was all behind us. I was really surprised that she was so dry with me after the trip and after our our long conversation. now fast-forward to the wedding, she wanted to do a bridal shower two months before her wedding and I had not budgeted for that please keep in mind. I have now spent approximately $4000 for this wedding. I had asked her previously if she won the bridal shower so I can budget to save for it. She declined saying it was going to be too expensive. when she came two months before the wedding asking for a bridal shower I told her I had no time as I’m a full-time student and I work full-time and I don’t have the money to pay for a bridal shower with only two months notice. She got upset and said to have her mother-in-law pay for it because I wasn’t able to afford it. 

We got to the island and she wanted to have her bridal shower the day I was flying in. I told her that made no sense because if my flight got delayed, I wouldn’t be able to set up decorations. Plus she was already having a bachelorette party. Across the wedding event, she barely spoke to me was really awkward and didn’t really interact with me even though I was a made of honor She only interacted with her friends and basically ignored me which other family members had picked up on after her wedding, she didn’t speak to me again and has been ignoring me for a solid year.

The wedding had a lot of nightmares such as her yelling at me about my maid of honor her Speech, even though she never told me I had one, ignoring me on her bachelorette party, only talking to her friends, scheduling things doing times when I had classes so I had to take class on my cell phone, etc.

Now here comes the stressful part. One of my uncles has passed away and we need to attend the funeral and she will be there. My entire family wants to address the situation and have us make up again. I am tired and exhausted of her treating me like a piece of garbage or I’m mad that you can step all over And this is my final straw. Her mom, my aunt has also not spoken to me for an entire year. I’m really just thinking about cutting them off not even attending my uncle’s funeral so I don’t have to see them. 

The problem is I don’t tend to speak up when people are hurting me. I sit there and take it until I snap and when I snap people always remember just me being aggressive and no one else hurting me over and over again.

I am not sure what to do, but I don’t want to rebuild a relationship with somebody who constantly hurts me, then cries and begs for forgiveness then does the same thing over and over again

Any advice would be appreciated because I don’t think I’m the asshole in this situation .",1,1767894047.0,AITAH,1,0.67,False

I moved to Chicago a few years ago and have been struggling to find a solid group of friends.  I'd love to meet some likeminded women to hang out with/develop close friendships with.

Here's a little about me:

* 35F, engaged (getting married in March '26)
* Lives in North Center/Roscoe Village
* Attorney
* Enjoys true crime/mysteries/thrillers in book, TV, podcast form--would love to find someone else who does as well so we can chat about it!
* Politically moderate--but please, no politics talk.  I am completely fatigued by it and have seen it ruin friendships.  
* Enjoys cooking, making cocktails, exploring new Chicago neighborhoods, reading, listening to podcasts, taking my dog to Montrose Beach, listening to live jazz, dining at local restaurants, lounging at coffee shops, going to museums and movie theaters, traveling abroad, shopping, drawing, spending time with family.

  
What I'm seeking:

* Close friendships with likeminded women
* Ideally late 20s-early 40s, but that is less important to me than good vibes
* We share some overlapping interests
* We can learn to support one another and cheer each other on through life's ups and downs
* We can have FUN together!  Wine nights and rom coms, book clubs, walks along the lakefront, GNO at some amazing Chicago restaurants, coffee dates, etc.  Whatever works!  I'm pretty open to new experiences.

  
If this appeals to you in any way, DM me!  I'd love to chat!

I sit with these men and have deep conversations and look into their eyes and really see their face. I could draw a very accurate picture of what they look like, but I am certain I have never met them before.

I heard once that human beings cannot create new faces, and that we can only piece together features from people we’ve met. But I swear these faces are unique and new. 

Does anyone have any opinions about dreams of people we haven’t met? In my experience my dreams are usually recycled memories or thoughts I’ve had from the day before.

I lost 155lbs, taught myself to code in a cheap room, and spent 2 years building a burnout regulator to save my own mind. It finally works. Now what?","I’m writing this because I’m currently white-knuckling a climb I never imagined would be this intense. I have no CS degree. I spent 10+ years in hospitality and breweries, masking my anxiety and suffering through the fun parts because my brain wouldn't stop racing. Two and a half years ago, I hit a breaking point. I decided to fix my biology. I lost 155lbs. In that process, I realized something critical: My brain has the same problem my body did. It doesn't know when to stop. It doesn't know how to regulate intake (information/tasks) or output (work). I decided to build a regulator for my mind.

I moved into a cheap room to keep my expenses low while I figured out what I wanted to do next. I started coding with Ai while bedridden due to a hole the size of a quarter in the back part up my upper leg from an infected cyst that decided to rupture. (2025 was a year.) I started building a ""Human Behavior OS"" based on the principles of Behavioral Economics that I used to lose the weight. I wrote the ontology for an AI backend to act as a voltage regulator. It recognizes micro-tasks within the big ones and decomposes them (reducing the freak out factor of trying new things). It optimizes when to rest. It acts as a cognitive prosthetic that protects me from my own bias to overwork.

A few days ago, it finally clicked. It took a massive, chaotic brain dump of tasks, labeled them, and spread them over a week based on my actual energy levels. It scheduled work but it did it in a safe way. It barely works. It’s held together by duct tape and coffee. But it works. I have proved to myself that I can build the tool. But I have zero real connections in tech. I’m just a guy in a room with a hospitality background who is building a thing to help him survive. I’m looking for advice from people who have been down this road:

The Interface Challenge: How do you design a UI for an app that sometimes tells the user ""No""? This is a regulator. How do I visualize ""You are done for the day"" without it feeling punitive?

The ""Wrapper"" Stigma: This uses LLMs. How do I explain that the value isn't the AI model, but the Behavioral Ontology I built on top of it? (The ""Secret Sauce"" is the system that kept me sane, not the text generation).

The Pitch: Would a veteran dev or product manager look at this and see a feature, or a product?

It’s exciting to imagine this becoming a real business that helps other people. Even if this just taught me how to work with AI deeply and opened the door to a life outside hospitality, it was already worth it. Thanks for reading. (I used Ai to help write this. It helps gather and organize my thoughts.)",1,1767893973.0,u_craftedchaos7,0,1.0,False

I’ve never been great about doing perfect dental hygiene, my parents never once bought me a toothbrush or anything similar.  When my dad was in his late 30s he went to a dentist a few times, had a tooth pulled, didn't bother brushing and ignored it, he seemed to enjoy taking pictures with a front missing tooth.  

My mom took me to a dentist for the first time around 13, he gave me a bunch of fillings and that was the end of that.  College had me extremely broke without any money or food and again I neglected dental anything.   Around 21 my wisdom teeth started coming in and it was the most painful unexpected thing ever.  I didn’t know what was going on, had never heard of wisdom teeth before, and didn’t have dental insurance, I bought a ton of orajel and waited it out.  Fistfuls of orajel and doubled over on the floor to get through that pain.  Eventually the top wisdom teeth pushed through and shattered several molars on the way in but the pain went away. 

A few months later I noticed a dark spot on one of the top teeth and figured I shouldn’t smile broadly anymore, and probably best to avoid that tooth, eat, and brush around it. Around 25 I bit into a sandwich and the bottom incisors started cracking and little bits came off, the tooth was still there so not a major problem.  A few years later I a fight with an angry girlfriend, she called me “black tooth” on her way out; “I guess people kind of notice that bad one, I should get better about avoiding it and not smiling as much,”  

I got better with dental hygiene, nothing hurt, no broad smiles, avoid that one front tooth when eating and brushing so that the tartar would make it look whiter, it’s a goner anyway, ""I'm going to stop looking at my teeth in the mirror because it makes me sad”.  

“I’m over thinking this, no one has perfect teeth, my dads teeth were dark tan, I shouldn't avoid smiling too much”  Not long after, I was joking around and laughing with some coworkers, I laughed and smiled too much and one of them stopped and stared for what felt like an eternity.  “Guess I was wrong, people do notice and judge, maybe I should let my moustache grow down more to help cover it” 

About 7 years afo I was eating lunch, and one of the top wisdoms popped out. “That damn tooth caused me so much pain way back”, I tossed it in the trash and kept going. About 5 years ago I was eating lunch and I bit into something and heard a startling loud CRUNCH on the back right molars, it didn’t hurt though, and there was a big channel across three or four teeth and food would get stuck in that. “I’ll start eating on the left side”. 

Shortly after I started getting inflamed gums, those hurt and it was difficult to eat simple pasta.  Some mouthwash usually clears it up in a few days; on and off for years inflamed gums or odd swelling, mouth wash, wait, rinse and repeat.  I didn’t feel any pain when there was no inflammation or swelling so I didn’t do anything about it. My teeth were junk anyway, I'm busy with work, family, other peoples stuff, I don’t look at them anymore, or ever smile where people can see and avoid one side and that one bad front; everything is alright.  “But, I enjoyed wearing a mask in public during covid so I could laugh and smile without hesitation, problem for another day.”

About a year and a half ago while eating a hamburger, some large chunk of something came out of the bottom incisors. That was my first experience with calculus chunks, I had no idea what it was, tossed out the hamburger and tried to figure it out.  The calculus was growing thick everywhere but I never noticed it.  I didn’t know if it was good or bad until a large chunk was missing and there were big gaps on the inside bottom incisors, maybe avoid those areas until it feels “normal” again. Three months later, feeling like it did before, I tried a leftover happy meal hamburger and another large calculus chunk came off from the same spot.  “Ok, well soft bread and hamburgers, burritos, pizza, stuff like that are off the menu. I’ll cut or tear them up and shove the pieces into the back left, hopefully no one will notice how I eat now”  Harder foods like tree nuts and mexican restaurant chips were completely off the menu, every time I put a brush in I thought a tooth would fall out. I never bothered to talk to anyone about it out of shame, embarrassment, and guilt.

This past labor day weekend I had a minor accident changing a saw blade and cut my finger.  Bandaged it up with some ointment, a few hours later I went to change the bandaids, a lot of blood came out, the room started getting dark and I woke up on the kitchen floor with my wife screaming at me.  “That was a really good nap. Why did you wake me up?”  

We went to Urgent Care. They gave me a tetanus shot, bandaged it properly and went home.  I tried taking a melatonin gummy to sleep and there was an incredible new pain from that one bad front tooth that had the dark spot 25 years earlier.  When I fell in the kitchen, my face hit the countertop and dislodged it, “this hurts too much, I can't eat or drink, it should have come out years ago, I guess I have to go get that pulled, maybe I don’t know.”  

Sunday morning I googled for any open dentist, Emergency Dental is open, the x-ray guy kept asking “what’s that black stuff on your bottom teeth?” I have no idea, I haven't looked at them in over a decade.  The emergency dentist was less than pleasant, she was having a bad day and started getting agitated and impatient about which one I wanted pulled.  “The one that’s lower, moving and in the wrong place, it should be easy to see”.  She got upset because I flinched when she touched it and gave me the hand mirror, WOW how could it have gotten so bad?  There was some weird brown star pattern on a “good one” next to the dislodged bad one.  For $490 she pulled the dislodged bad one, “you need to have them all pulled right now, if you have a family that you care about you need to have them all gone now”. 

I went home and talked to my wife. There are 100 dentists in the area, we found one that specialized in restoration, and went to the appointment.  Two minutes in; “you have severe periodontitis, you need to have everything extracted and get dentures that soak in a cup at night, here are some dentures to look at and a pamphlet on gum disease.  You’re young; only 47, if you had come 10 or 15 years ago maybe I could have helped you”  

She gave me a referral to a denture specialist 40 minutes away, Google Maps led me to a periodontist, I went in and asked if I was in the right place, the office manager was in a mood she said something disrespectful, implied that i was stupid and sent me to the right place a few doors down.  In that lobby a lady around my age stormed out almost crying and some old guy started making fun of her, this wasn’t a good start.  The denture dentist did another x-ray, listened to my story and stared blankly.  He didn’t want to do impressions without a debridement, made another appointment for that and ended up at the periodontist with the angry receptionist a week later.  

The periodontist was pleasant but had no information from the denture guy that sent me for the debridement, full story all over again, back in the chair, another set of x-rays, and some pokey metal thing around every tooth, “they all have to come out” I knew this though, this is at least the fourth person saying the same thing.  “The calculus is gluing your teeth in place, if I debride them they will fall out, let’s do a 3D scan.”  “I don’t need it if they all come out for dentures""  wink and smile, “just get it anyway”.  I thought that if i refused it then maybe she wouldn’t do a great job when I come back, $350 that insurance isn't reimbursing.  

They had me sit and watch youtube videos of the dangers of gum disease. “You should think about the life you're giving your family and if you die from it who's going to be there for them?”  This was starting to feel like high pressure sales tactics kind of a red flag.  The treatment coordinator was ready to see me, she said dental insurance is a scam but don’t worry they finance.  She gave me an out of pocket cost breakdown of $26,600 for extraction and bone grafts; the dentures themselves would be a completely different unknown amount at the first practice. 

I was only there for the consultation to schedule the debridement, to schedule impressions, to schedule extraction not to buy a timeshare.  I was getting weirded out and annoyed and had to get back to work, I told her that I would look it over and call.  “NO, you have to come in and go over it in person, that's our policy”  half a dozen emails back and forth and she didn’t budge about driving 40 minutes each way to look at the prices, I googled local prices, plugged it into GPT, and asked on Reddit.  It seemed astronomical and the treatment coordinator was hard to deal with and now I'm mad about the useless $350 scan. I demanded a copy of the 3D scan that they mailed a week later, and told them to never contact me again.  No other practice was wanting to or willing to use that CD.

I googled and called a lot more practices closer to my house, I wanted a good nearby one stop shop that I could trust. Didn’t get a response, nobody called back, “we don’t do both extractions and dentures”.  I made appointments with Nuvia with an $89 deposit, Affordable Dentures with poor reviews as a backup, and practice with massage chairs, starbucks coffee, a brand new building, and TVs on the ceiling in every room, “this seems too fancy for me they probably only help country club people with already perfect teeth”

I went to the fancy place, back in the chair, the full story again, examined, x-rays, and I asked for pricing and services.  The dentist told me to “go shop around more, get prices and second opinions, get a feeling for the dentist, think about it and call back if I want to pursue it with us.”  Cost total was $6,000 for the immediates and $9,900 for the extractions, it might have been high I'm ok with the price for the area though.  This guy might be alright.

I couldn’t cancel Nuvia without giving up my $89, their local office was grody and kind of gross.  They wanted photos and I got worried that metal things to keep my mouth open for the pictures would disturb the calculus glue and some would pop out, they sent me to another set of x-rays and 3D scan.  I made up a story about my boss blowing up my phone to get out of there but they wanted me to talk to their dentist before I left.  I sat in his office and he had about 100 cases or protein shakes; “that’s weird, maybe he’s some kind of body builder.” He brought in the promotional material showing me with my broken brown nubs and a mockup of phosphorous white new teeth, which was super creepy.  The cost estimate for everything started at $50k but they have financing. He was cool and said “if you don’t get it done here, just get it done for yourself”

I was sick of being in the chair, starting over with another new place, getting x-rays, calling around, asking on reddit, arguing with myself about leaving it alone, no idea what to do, obsessing, googling. I still had four good teeth that I ate with.  I asked my 11 year old son “what advice would I give you?” “rip the bandaid off and do it”  he was right.

I scheduled impressions with the fancy place.  The dental assistant was really good about my worry about losing more from the impression material pulling the calculus glue out and teeth with it.  It did go fine though minty blue impression gunk didn’t pull any others out with it.

When should I eat normally again?  “About two weeks” ok, two weeks I should be around normal with a nice smile around Christmas.  That didn’t happen.

Dec 11 2025 full extraction of remaining 29 (including 2 bottom horizontal wisdom teeth).  The assistant kept saying that there would be some discomfort for a while until it heals, “what does discomfort mean?” “just some pain” read PAIN.  The total procedure of extraction was about an hour and a half a lot were not really being held on by bone.  I was a bloody novacained mess, the immediates were placed in and the dentist pressed hard to look in the mirror, I just didn’t want to, I hadn't looked at my teeth in a mirror for over a decade and felt like a failure.  I went to the restroom and caught my reflection and I was shocked at how gross I looked with drooping lips from the novacaine and blood on my face and hands. I was a handsome guy with no smile before doing all of this, my life was over. I had to sit down for a while to compose myself before going home to sleep it off.  5 hours later the numbing medicine was still keeping my lip drooping and I could barely speak.  I was a total mess and really angry with myself for going through with it at all. “Worst mistake i’ve ever made, my old teeth were gross but I had four that I could use.”

The next day, the dentist said everything looked good so far, I was still mad about everything though, especially at myself for going through it and not leaving well enough alone.  He said drinking from straws is fine, conflicting with some other advice, “be sure to take them out nightly and brush them daily before putting them back in”.  Schedule follow up for a week later, now I know what the Nuvia guys protein shakes were about, no one mentioned drinking metamucil or miralax though.  I went back in and he shaved down parts that were rubbing and causing sores. 

They scheduled another week later for follow up, it still hurts on the top sides, top back, and painful to put in the bottom in the front and inside.  I was drinking protein shakes, drinkable stuff like yogurt and tomato soup, I tried moving to more solid food like mushed peas and chicken noodle soup.  There was no way that I would try anything more solid than that.  I also ignored my own diet by adding pudding and milk shakes. “I want to feel normal again, i’ll worry about the calories when I can eat again”. 

Third follow up two weeks after extraction on a Friday afternoon, the dentist shaved down the tops and bottoms again.  The bottom was completely unbearable and I couldn't keep them in for more than a minute.  “I would do anything to get my broken brown nubs back: Talking and swallowing irritated a sore that made it impossible. “My life is over” with lots of highs and lows.  Saturday morning only the emergency dentist was open but i’m not going back there after the first time. I called and left a message for the office and they didn’t get back to me (they admitted that it was a major faux pas on their part).  

Two dental offices said they were open, one had no availability and another had wrong hours posted.  “I’m going to leave the bottom out until I get back into the dentist office.” “wait I’ve seen 80 year old laughing and eating in restaurants, this dentist must be a moron and I got cheated.  All I want is my broken brown garbage back” 

When I did finally get back in on Tuesday morning, more shaving down the bottom a little on top and he applied relining to the bottom that smelled and tasted like minty model glue, “do not add any adhesive to the bottom at all, take them out nightly, brush them daily, slowly try eating solids”

Everything is starting to get better after almost three weeks. I'm starting to try to eat more solid food with a knife and fork. Maybe this whole thing wasn't a horrible decision. That lasted about a day, I added adhesive correctly to the top and tried eating the leftovers from the previous evening when everything was not bad, the tops started rocking in the back with more unbearable pain.  “WHY DID I DO THIS TO MYSELF?  I’m going to go get a good boba tea because this sucks and I want something that I like and can drink easily.  NOW THE TOP FRONT LEFT HURTS” 

I called back and got in the same day, he shaved a bit more off the bottom, front and top soft reline minty model glue added.  I waited about 6 hours, and decided that if it hurts to eat solids I’ll drink soup again until the next follow up.  I overate a ton of real solid food with only minor annoyances from the front sore and bottom sore that needs more shaving next visit. FIRST REAL SOLID FOOD MEAL IN A MONTH! I WANT TO EAT EVERYTHING. It started to feel almost like before, but not avoiding one side, trying to use all of the new teeth, and remembering that I don’t have to cover my mouth when I laugh anymore.

have a crush on a girl I do volunteer work with. We’ve known each other for a few weeks and only see each other in person during activities, so we don’t get much time to talk.
In person, she’s very warm with me: strong hugs (she doesn’t do that with others), playful energy, once she brushed her hand across my back while passing by, cheek kiss once, lots of hearts and emojis. She also casually mentioned that when she gets back from a trip she could invite me over for coffee, and when I later said “maybe we’ll get a coffee sometime” she said “yeah, gladly”.
But over text she’s very inconsistent. Sometimes replies late, sometimes forgets messages, once left me on read for a day. She says she’s bad at texting, and when she does reply she’s kind and apologetic , but the contrast messes with my head.
I’m queer, she doesn’t know that, and I’m not even 100% sure she is but she looks very queer. I don’t want to confess feelings, I was just thinking of asking her for a coffee since I’ll already be in town for an appointment.

TL;DR:
I (19F) confessed to my best friend (19M) of several years after realizing I had feelings for him. He didn’t reject or accept me, asking instead for time to think because he values our friendship and wants to be sure of his feelings. We go out on “dates” for about 8 months and have grown emotionally and physically closer, but he still hasn’t made a decision. While I understand he’s autistic and needs time to process emotions, waiting is becoming emotionally exhausting, and I’m unsure whether to keep waiting or how to talk to him about it without pressuring him.

So, I(19F) got close to this guy(19M) when we were both around 14-15, and since then we had been inseparable. He was someone that I held very special and deep in my heart. But, I didnt develop any feelings him until only recently. Last year, around April. I sat with them for a month maybe before saying anything. I was scared about telling him ofcours, but i trusted him enough to know that even if he didnt feel the same this wouldnt ruin our friendship.

So I confessed. He didn’t reject me, but he didnt accept the confession either. He simply told me to just ""wait"". He told me he needed time to think about it. He also told me that this was a decision he had never made before and wanted to put real thought into the decision, because he cares deeply about our friendship, and me, and wanted to be sure about his feelings before calling it love.

When I heard that, it did hurt a little but it also felt honest. I knew what kind of person he was when I confessed, and was ready for any answer he was willing to give. So, I agreed to wait. Actually, I was 90% sure he was going to reject me. He's had girls in the past confess to him before, but he had always turned them down.

After I told him that I would agree to wait for his answer, he suggested for us to start going on ""dates"". To spend even more time with eachother, and get closer on a more intimate level. So he can make a decision more clearly. So we started going out on dates. Like, going out for Coffee, long walks, sitting beside each other in quiet places, talking for hours. We went on like this for around 8 months. Which, tbh was much longer than I expected. But, I was still fine with things to an extent.

During these 8 months of dates we had also become closer. physically. Nothing crazy tho. More on holding hands(he initiated it), hugs, laying on eachothers shoulders, looking into eachothers eyes after hugs, etc. It feels like a cute highschool relationship.

Every time we got closer, I wondered: Does this mean he’s closer to choosing me?

I could feel myself falling deeper while he stayed careful, still trying to understand his feelings. He's autistic. So, I know emotions don’t come easily or clearly to him. But, I can’t help wondering if I’m waiting for something that may never arrive. 

I don’t want to pressure him. I don’t want to rush his first relationship or make him choose out of fear of losing me. At the same time, staying in this in-between space is starting to hurt. Loving someone quietly for months, hoping each day brings clarity, is exhausting in ways I didn’t expect.

I just dont know what to do. If you guys have advice on what I should do, or say to him. Or maybe give ways to also help him out in figuring things out it would be really appreciated.

1q7i16w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q7i16w,"In-Hand Review: Stussy Dice Knit is a 10/10, but mixed feelings on the CH Jeans 🎲 (ft. Supreme, Nike, Amiri)","1. Chrome Hearts Multi-Color Cross Trucker Hat**

**Rating:** 7/10
**Review:** It’s a loud piece. The colors on the crosses are vibrant, and the mesh quality is standard—breathable and decent for hot weather. However, the print on the foam front feels a little plasticky, like it might crack or peel after a summer of wear. The silver button on top is a nice detail, but overall it feels a bit lightweight compared to other CH caps I’ve handled.
**Fit:** Standard snapback fit. Sits a bit high on the head.

### **2. New Era NY Yankees Fitted (Side Patch)**

**Rating:** 9/10
**Review:** Can’t go wrong with a classic. The embroidery on the NY logo and the side patch is super clean—no loose threads or connected stitching. The brim came with a standard flat shape but curved easily. The wool blend feels structured and durable. Not much to complain about here, it does exactly what it's supposed to do.
**Fit:** True to size. Fits my head shape perfectly without pinching.

### **3. Nike Tech Fleece Jacket (Grey/Black)**

**Rating:** 8/10
**Review:** The color blocking on this is sick, gives it a more aggressive look than the solid grey ones. Material is smooth and comfortable, standard Tech Fleece quality. My only gripe is the main zipper; it feels a little stiff and catches slightly near the bottom. Hopefully, it loosens up with wear.
**Fit:** Fits slim. At 180cm, the Medium is a perfect fitted look, but if you want to layer a hoodie underneath, you might struggle. Length is spot on.

### **4. Chrome Hearts Black Tonal Cross Jeans**

**Rating:** 8.5/10
**Review:** These are way more wearable than the blue ones (see #6). The black-on-black patches are subtle and the leather crosses feel decent quality. The denim itself is heavy and rigid, which I like. The buttonhole was incredibly tight, had to fight it to get them open the first time. The wash looks authentic.
**Fit:** Waist is TTS. The length stacks nicely on my Jordans without dragging on the floor.

### **5. Supreme Box Logo Hoodie (Black)**

**Rating:** 7.5/10
**Review:** The blank on this is heavy and stiff—definitely a winter hoodie. The box logo embroidery is centered and straight, no floating 'e'. However, the neck hole is surprisingly tight/small. It’s a struggle to get my head through without messing up my hair. It’s a classic piece, but the comfort isn’t 10/10 due to the stiffness.
**Fit:** Boxy fit. Sleeves are a tiny bit short for my arms (180cm), but the chest is roomy.

### **6. Chrome Hearts Blue Patch Jeans**

**Rating:** 5/10
**Review:** Honestly, not feeling these as much in hand. The craftsmanship is fine, but the design is just too loud in person. The ""CHROME HEARTS"" text across the back is huge and the blue leather patches contrast too much for daily wear. The denim feels slightly thinner than the black pair (#4) as well. Hard to style without looking like a walking billboard.
**Fit:** Fits same as the black pair, straight leg cut.

### **7. Stussy Dice Knit Sweater**

**Rating:** 9.5/10
**Review:** Favorite item of the haul. The knit is surprisingly soft and not itchy at all against bare skin. The dice graphic is woven in clearly, not just printed on top. It has a nice weight to it and drapes really well. Feels like a quality garment that will last a long time.
**Fit:** Slightly oversized/relaxed. The perfect baggy fit for my build.

### **8. Amiri ""Imagination"" Hoodie**

**Rating:** 6/10
**Review:** A bit disappointed with this one. For an ""Amiri"" piece, the blank feels kinda thin and flimsy compared to the Supreme or Carhartt hoodies. The print is okay, but it feels like it might fade after a few washes. It looks cool, but the quality doesn't match the aesthetic. It feels more like a fast-fashion hoodie than a luxury rep.
**Fit:** Fits slightly cropped and wide.

### **9. Carhartt WIP Embroidered Hoodie (Cream)**

**Rating:** 10/10
**Review:** Best bang for your buck. The cream color is beautiful in person (though I’m terrified of spilling coffee on it). The ""Carhartt"" embroidery is thick and premium. The fleece lining is super soft. It’s simple, clean, and feels indestructible.
**Fit:** TTS. Not too boxy, not too slim. Sleeves hit perfectly at the wrist.

### **10. Stussy Arch Logo Hoodie (Black/Yellow)**

**Rating:** 8.5/10
**Review:** Another solid Stussy piece. The yellow text pops really nicely against the black. The logo is a chenille-style texture which adds some nice depth. It’s a good daily driver hoodie. Cuffs are nice and tight, holding the sleeves up well.
**Fit:** Fits similar to the Carhartt one, maybe a little looser in the chest area. Ideal for a relaxed street fit.

Carloads of oranges dumped on the ground. The people came for miles to take the fruit, but this could not be. How would they buy oranges at twenty cents a dozen if they could drive out and pick them up? And men with hoses squirt kerosene on the oranges, and they are angry at the crime, angry at the people who have come to take the fruit. 

**A million people hungry, needing the fruit- and kerosene sprayed over the golden mountains.**

And the smell of rot fills the country. Burn coffee for fuel in the ships. Burn corn to keep warm, it makes a hot fire. Dump potatoes in the rivers and place guards along the banks to keep the hungry people from fishing them out. Slaughter the pigs and bury them, and let the putrescence drip down into the earth.

**There is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation.**

There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our success. The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit. And children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange. 

**And coroners must fill in the certificate- died of malnutrition- because the food must rot, must be forced to rot.**

The people come with nets to fish for potatoes in the river, and the guards hold them back; they come in rattling cars to get the dumped oranges, but the kerosene is sprayed. And they stand still and watch the potatoes float by, listen to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quick-lime, watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is the failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. 

**In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.**

However, I can't really change my insurance since it was necessary in order to attend group therapy and pay for a procedure that I'm getting done in February. I've tried using the app only for it to constantly lag while I'm in the store. My only access to Walmart is during scheduled group therapy, so I'm on a massive time crunch the whole time.

I simply don't have time to wait for each page on the UHC app to load THEN scan each individual item, nor do I have the time to wait around for an associate that doesn't even know how to do their job after having to cancel half the items. For Wellcare, I just used muscle memory based on purchases I made in the past. Whatever the card didn't purchase, I just asked the person at the register to put back (which was mostly me testing the waters on hygiene items like wipes or shampoo).

Ucard won't pay for 99% of ""healthy"" food at Dollar General except for 3-4 small junk items across the entire store. I had much better luck at Walmart, but I still struggled as Walmart is much further away than Dollar General and most of the items my benefits ""qualified"" for were perishable (I live in a place that doesn't have refrigerators for perishables).

The app says my card will pay for Velveeta cheese slices, but not the small cups of pasta (the big bowls haven't been added to the catalog).It pays for Armour Pepperoni, but not Hormel. It pays for Lunchables Pizza,  but the Chicken Dunks have yet to be added. It pays for Brisk Tea, but Ocean Spray Cran x Grape has yet to be added.

It won't pay for any kind of sliced meats from Armour nor Oscar Meyer. It will pay for Hershey's chocolate chips AND Lay's potato chips, but doesn't pay for any kind of packaged/canned fruit as far as I can tell (I tried peaches). It pays for Vienna Sausages, but won't pay for salad bowls. It will pay for Great Value coffee pods, but not their riccota cheese. Some smaller items won't even scan at all, nor can they be entered manually because they don't have 12 numbers in their barcodes. 

I even scanned some Naked Juice with the app LITERALLY SAYING that it qualified for my benefits only for the scanner to charge ""remaining balance"" for it during checkout. The self-checkout machine at Walmart still charged my card for the rest of the items according to the app, but the checkout machine wouldn't pop up the screen to print any kind of receipt at all once the Naked Juice was removed.

Getting it removed was a complete hassle as the associate kept confusing the single bottle of Naked Juice (Rainbow Machine) with an entire 8-pack of Splash Refresher (Kiwi Watermelon). I would've offered to just pay for the darn thing and be done, but I was on a time crunch and didn't have enough money on me at the time. We live in a rural small town, so it's not even that big of a store (meaning that I'll probably run into this person multiple times).

Again, I was mostly scanning these items just out of curiousity, but with my living situation and sensory issues it feels like I can only buy $5-$10 worth of actual scraps compared to my Wellcare Spendables card that I used all throughout last year at both Walmart and Dollar General. I wasn't even trying to buy junk with either card, as I already don't have access to healthy food as it is and genuinely miss it.

I did get some goat cheese which was really nice snack, but I mostly use these benefits to purchase non-perishables and pre-packaged goods so I don't have to go hungry (the food they serve at the place I'm staying makes me sick). If I have to buy food for my starving hoarder parents, there's next to nothing at Dollar General that really qualifies except for bottom of the barrel trash like Lays chips, Nature Valley granola bars, and Vienna sausages.

I'm already pissed the fuck off at group therapy with the way the director tends to manhandle clients. They constantly get hateful with me over nothing, and one of their favorite clients even assaulted two of my ""barely legal"" roommates. It's honestly starting to become a liability issue with some of the things that's been happening lately.

I even told the director that an error occured in the UHC app, and they were all in a big rush saying that if tge product doesn't read during checkout then the card just won't pay for it. I'm one of the only people for miles on end who has a sliver of basic tech literacy, so this was to be expected. With the way they praised United Healthcare like the second coming of Jesus Christ, youd think they'd have basic pity about something like that.

Their idea of playing Russian roulette with the self-checkout is a waste of time as it takes like five times longer to wait around for an available associate to clear items than to scan them with my phone beforehand. That's WITH having to manually sign into the UHC app every single time my phone goes to sleep, and THEN waiting several minutes per page to load. The director is also the type to get hasty with me when I'm ""running late"".

My family is more than likely going to force me to stay right now as it's the only program for hundreds of miles that even qualifies for the 1915(i) RISE Initiative. As I'm under a guardianship, I won't be able to change my insurance from United Healthcare at ALL until I'm able to find a place to live through their housing program.

I'm immediately switching providers for both once I'm housed, which could take anywhere from a few months to a year or two after the fact. However, I still need to how the fuck to use my Ucard during the months that I'll be spending at their transitional houses trying to figure out new providers. I'm just wondering what in the actual fuck I can actually do with my Ucard until all this bullshit is settled?

1q7htbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1q7htbh/5050_and_coffee_dates/,50/50 and “Coffee Dates”,"Why people make it so hard?
Since the interest is mutual, so should the bill!
I’ve seen a lot of female profiles with  “No 50/50 for me” and some more subtle like “I do dating old school”, “princess/queen treatment”.
And also “I don’t do coffee dates” or “take me somewhere nice”
From the get go? With someone you’ve never met before? Really?
50/50 is beneficial because there’s no pressure to “get lucky” for men, and therefore the women also can relax more. It’s equal balance. No one is more special, no one is treated like an object or a prize.
Some people argue “Oh, who invites, pays!” But how are people supposed to meet if nobody takes the initiative?  Good behavior (taking the initiative) should be rewarded, and not the opposite.
And why does it have to be an expensive place?
The place can actually act as a distraction to two people trying to figure out each other.
I think it’s a red flag and possibly people just wanting to score free meals.
To be fair, this is more common among American, Russian and Ukrainian women. Men are expected to pay for the first date (and the others). Western European women are way more chill and sometimes even offer to pay for the dates. And a walk on the park is fine.

This is gonna be a long one .

My family is traditionally Caribbean and family always comes first . 

I was raised in a household with my grandmother along with my cousins so we function like siblings.

My older Girl cousin got has some tendencies to make things all about her . We have had many a fights over the years . A few examples 

Telling me I wouldn’t be where I was if her mom never helped me go to school (then leaving me alone in another country that I don’t know while she had coffee with her friend ignoring me).

Traveled back home together with her and her friends and her man and she ignored me half the trip 

Making food for everyone in the house but me but then acting oblivious like she never ment to do it.

We flew to our home country to do some wedding planning for her and she texted her man about how Much she had to walk on egg shells around me and how I always ruin her vybe and if she could drive she could take my dads car and drive ( I flew down specifically to help her and borrowed my dads car to drive her around the island) . 

Then proceeded to get mad at me that i wasn’t inside the salon with her the enter time she was getting her hair done and her make up done . ( I had stepped outside because my friend who had not seen me in a year stopped by) .

Her wedding was a year later and she bearly spoke to me after the trip. She then would only message me when she needed me to do something or a pay for something for her wedding. I tried to clear the air about the trip and we both admitted where we went wrong even though I don’t think I did anything incorrectly and apologize. Thinking that was all behind us. I was really surprised that she was so dry with me after the trip and after our our long conversation. now fast-forward to the wedding, she wanted to do a bridal shower two months before her wedding and I had not budgeted for that please keep in mind. I have now spent approximately $4000 for this wedding. I had asked her previously if she won the bridal shower so I can budget to save for it. She declined saying it was going to be too expensive. when she came two months before the wedding asking for a bridal shower I told her I had no time as I’m a full-time student and I work full-time and I don’t have the money to pay for a bridal shower with only two months notice. She got upset and said to have her mother-in-law pay for it because I wasn’t able to afford it. 

We got to the island and she wanted to have her bridal shower the day I was flying in. I told her that made no sense because if my flight got delayed, I wouldn’t be able to set up decorations. Plus she was already having a bachelorette party. Across the wedding event, she barely spoke to me was really awkward and didn’t really interact with me even though I was a made of honor She only interacted with her friends and basically ignored me which other family members had picked up on after her wedding, she didn’t speak to me again and has been ignoring me for a solid year.

The wedding had a lot of nightmares such as her yelling at me about my maid of honor her Speech, even though she never told me I had one, ignoring me on her bachelorette party, only talking to her friends, scheduling things doing times when I had classes so I had to take class on my cell phone, etc.

Now here comes the stressful part. One of my uncles has passed away and we need to attend the funeral and she will be there. My entire family wants to address the situation and have us make up again. I am tired and exhausted of her treating me like a piece of garbage or I’m mad that you can step all over And this is my final straw. Her mom, my aunt has also not spoken to me for an entire year. I’m really just thinking about cutting them off not even attending my uncle’s funeral so I don’t have to see them. 

The problem is I don’t tend to speak up when people are hurting me. I sit there and take it until I snap and when I snap people always remember just me being aggressive and no one else hurting me over and over again.

I am not sure what to do, but I don’t want to rebuild a relationship with somebody who constantly hurts me, then cries and begs for forgiveness then does the same thing over and over again

Me and my friends were just hanging out, having coffee, playing chess, chilling. Me and one friend decided to do a match while everyone else watched. Usual trash talk, laughter, vibes were good.

Somehow after the game our conversation turned into an argument (friendly, obviously 😅) and that argument turned into a deal:

If I win, he buys my perfume for ₹1000

If I lose, I give it to him for free.

At first we thought, “Rock paper scissors?”

I said nah.

Then, “Let’s do a coin toss.”

Problem: no coin.

Things got a little heated, we’re walking, still debating, and then we straight up asked a stranger for a coin like it was a life-or-death situation. Somehow, we actually got one.

Now here’s the funny part — I was \*sure\* I’d choose heads. No idea why, but at the last second I said \*\*tails\*\*.

Coin goes up.

Coin comes down.

\*\*TAILS.\*\*

I won. Lost my mind. Pure joy. I even kissed my friend out of excitement 😂

It wasn’t about the money or the perfume — it was that whole stupid, chaotic, wholesome sequence that made the day memorable. One of those moments you randomly remember and smile.

Gale pulled up the notification from before. 'Foreign world,' it said. Unmistakably, it referred to Earth. What made him gulp was the word 'enslaved.' Again, it was about the blue moon. That damned celestial thing that never went away.

His fists clenched. Nails dug into his palm. He forced himself to take a deep breath, allowing himself to relax and flush the negative feelings away.

Now's not the time. Focus. Get out and leave this forsakened world. None of this shit will matter once he goes back to Earth and gets his G.E.D. Get a job after, maybe at a coffee shop, and forget everything that happened. Coffee shops are great for making friends. All the movies had people make friends in coffee shops, right?

Right.

Gale surveyed his surroundings. No more ghouls. Probably more back there. Tendrils told him those ones weren't coming, though. It also told him a large group was slowly coming his way.

He crept forward, his body low to the ground, using the trunk of a dead tree for cover. He searched for the best path to remain hidden.

Peeking through the wide clearing, a large group of people marched along the trench's path. More and more figures appeared from the thick dead trees. They wielded makeshift weapons made from sticks, rakes, shovels, pitchforks, and kitchen knives.

The metal of the kitchen knife would've been useful if it wasn't so short. Better than bone.

A too familiar face led the group, Elliot. There was no mistaking his foul, yellowed teeth and manic eyes anywhere. He wore what looked like a pope's outfit. Gold leaf glimmered under the dim blue moonlight at the gilded edges.

Everyone around him moved like robots low on battery. Robotic and clunky. It was obvious it was an army of thralls. Each one wore an eye amulet that Drew had mentioned.

Elliot didn't.

The man looked left and right. Eyes wide open. Knuckles white from clenching his staff.

Gale's fingers twitched. It would be so easy to cross the distance between where he was and where that asshole was. But life never made anything that easy. It could've been a trap or it could be him underestimating what Elliot could do.

Attacking now would just create an all out melee between the convoy and this army. Four against however many were in front of him.

Activating Distort, the light bent around him, making him nigh invisible. He treaded carefully along the ground, silently, not stepping on any twigs that would cause a snap. Even when he was careful, it would have looked like he was running rather than being careful.

The convoy came into view, and Rachel was there at the front.

""Rachel,"" Gale whispered as he released Distort.

""Gale! Jeeze. That scared me."" She jumped slightly at his appearance. ""What's wrong?""

""Took care of the ghouls."" Gale's eyes darted to the convoy. ""Bigger problems after. Blue Haven, big army. Elliot's with them.""

Rachel turned to the convoy without hesitation. ""Everyone, we need to keep going. Stay quiet and stay close.""

Gale fell into step beside Rachel. ""I'll keep tabs on Blue Haven's forces, relay their positions to you. We need to stay one step ahead.""

Before he could move, Rachel grabbed his arm.

""Be careful,"" she said.

""I will,"" he said as he activated Distort. Gale vanished, then ran back towards where Elliot was. The army wasn't that far from them. Just an hour and a half's worth of walking by mundane standards. Close, but safe as long as the convoy kept moving.

He ran through the dead forest not stepping on anything that would snap once again. The trees gave him plenty of cover but also made him strain his mind to track where each step was.

Once he was near, he caught sight of Elliot again. Gale spread out Breath of the Void's tendrils, focused on the whole army beside Elliot.

The Blue Haven army moved with a sluggish pace. Each of the thralls dragged their feet and weapons across the ground as they headed towards the direction of the convoy. They were even slower than the convoy members, like actual zombies.

""Useless, all of them,"" Elliot bit his nails. ""Marcus couldn't even handle a simple task, and Drew... I expected more from him. Boasted being an attuned and then getting killed by fucking babies.""

A thrall bumped into Elliot's pacing. Falling backwards, it got up with no complaints. Not even a glance at Elliot and the man did the same as if the humanoid object that had just bumped into him didn't exist.

""Your radiance guides us, my princess. Your light guides us to the heathens who will soon be your sustenance."" Elliot clasped his hands together. ""We'll find them soon enough. There's nowhere for them to hide in your domain. All of this land belongs to your majesty.""

Another thrall bumped into Elliot. This time, the thrall almost tripped him.

Elliot raised his hand and smacked the thrall across the face. ""How dare you disturb my prayers! You fools should consider yourselves fortunate enough to be given a chance to submit to her majesty! Now get back up!""

The man started biting his nails even more feverishly. Blood started dripping from his nails and catching on his teeth. Yet that didn't stop him from biting even more.

""Soon, your majesty. Their youth will be yours."" Elliot casually swatted away a thrall moving too slowly in front of him. The thrall fell onto the ground only to be stepped on by the rest of the thralls. ""They can run all they want, but there's no escape from this world. We have all the time we need.""

This whole thing repeated over and over. Elliot's actions and tone shifted from annoyance at the thralls and then back to his prayers. A man broken by the blue moon.

And it was a good thing. The army's slow progress was at a snail's pace. The convoy was slow enough. Gale couldn't even imagine a much slower pace until he saw what's in front of him.

""Get up!"" Elliot shouted, not even bothering to look at the fallen. ""You're slowing us down. If you can't keep up, just die.""

The thrall struggled, clearly still getting walked all over by the others. It got up slowly, unnaturally, like it was in slow motion.

Wait a minute. Drew also wore the amulet, and he still had his conscience. Clearly he didn't have control over his body. He was a powerful individual, so maybe he retained his intelligence. Wouldn't that mean that the thralls in front of him still had some semblance of sentience?

Gale's fist clenched into a ball. Probably. Most definitely. Marcus also wore the amulet. He was a normal human being, yet he felt alive until he became that ghoul.

The look in Marcus's eyes as he held onto his bleeding neck. The thrashing on the floor board as Gale put all his weight to suppress the boy.

Bile dared to come up Gale's throat. There was no choice, right? If he didn't kill Marcus, everything would've gone much worse. Just like now, if he didn't dare to kill the scouts or Elliot's thralls, it would be him to die. Or worse, it would be Rachel being fed to that celestial body up in the sky.

The shallow breaths of the Blue Haven army reached Gale's ears. Surprisingly, the tendrils allowed him to hear their heartbeats. It was there. Beating fast. They were alive. Yet when he peered at them using those very same tendrils, they looked like husks of bodies. Moving corpses.

They trudged on through the lifeless forest. On the ground carved a footpath of dragged feet. The shadow did say *everyone in Blue Haven was already dead, boy.*

How?! The heartbeats. The breathing.

""Stop, you four, set up my tent. Hurry it up. Idiots."" Elliot stopped, and the whole army halted in unison.

The thralls he looked at moved sluggishly. Moving towards the boxes at the back of the march, they fumbled opening the lids.

""Hurry it up, idiots!"" Elliot shouted.

The shouting didn't change the speed of the thralls. After opening the box, the thralls rummaged through the items in the box. They picked up a large piece of cloth and poles. The size of the cloth could and would have probably fit a couple of people inside the tent.

Elliot pointed to a nearby flat area on the ground. In response, the thralls moved the items over to the area he pointed at and started setting up the poles for the tent.

Gale inched back from the army. Keeping his head low, he swung his head down over a low branch, careful not to cause it to move. Elliot was focused on ordering the thralls to set up a tent. It was time to go back and report.

He had seen enough to form a clear picture of what they were up against, and it didn't look good. If all of those thralls turned into ghouls, even just punching off the heads won't be good enough before they ran out of steam.

Gale quickly darted between the dead forest. Each tree whooshed by him. The sound of whispers reached his ears as he neared the convoy's hiding spot.

""Some of them might not be able to keep up at this rate… they're too tired,"" Rachel said. Ollie and Annett were with her.

""Well, it's either that or the crazies catch up to us,"" Ollie replied.

""Everyone's already prepared. It'll be a dash to the exit, and people know not all of them will make it,"" Annett said.

Gale released his distort beside Rachel. His sudden appearance caused all 3 to flinch.

""Seriously? That again?"" Rachel said, putting her hand on her chest. ""Anyways, what'd you see?""

Gale took another deep breath once again, feeling the eyes of all three.

""Blue Haven group is moving slow. Elliot's leading. Not making much progress. Bodies slower than the bodies here."" He pointed at the members, then at where the Blue Haven army was.

""Sorry, but what?"" Ollie asked, tilting his head.

Annett cleared her throat. ""What he's saying is that they're slower than us. Ain't that right?""

Gale nodded. They really shouldn't have stared at him like that. Pressure made his mouth feel weird, and then his tongue just became numb after blanking out.

Rachel sighed as her shoulders sagged. ""Phew. Looks like we might have some time to catch our breaths then.""

""Best news I've heard all day. Dunno 'bout you guys, but I could really use a breather,"" Ollie softly punched at Gale's arms.

Annett dropped her butt onto the dry ground. ""Me too. I don't remember the last time we had a break.""

""You really think it's ok to take a rest, Gale?"" Rachel's gaze turned towards where he came from.

""Certain. Elliot already set up camp. He won't be going anywhere for a while."" Gale leaned on a tree as he observed the convoy. Everyone massaged their feet and calves. The children weren't even energetic anymore. They just sat there, clinging on to their parents.

""Eh, the boy can talk after all,"" Ollie snickered.

""Alright,"" Rachel said. She turned to the convoy and announced, ""We're going to take a short break. Find a spot to sit, but stay alert. Get ready to move out at any time as well.""

The children immediately found their own spots near a tree with their parents, fighting for the more flatter grounds. The younger ones in their mid-20s laid down their baggage in the flat areas nearby as well.

One particular old man had his usual grumpy look coming straight at the group.

""This is madness!"" Lennard pushed his way to the front where Gale and the rest rested. The old man's face became redder and redder as he got to speaking distance to Rachel. ""We're being chased by those... those monsters, and you want to take a nap? A nap?!""

""Lennard, not now. If we don't rest now, some might fall from exhaustion,"" Rachel waved her arms.

Lennard surveyed the convoy. His head stopped when his eyes landed on Hailey and Anna. ""We wouldn't even be in this mess if it weren't for them! If we left that girl and her mom, we'd be long gone by now. Far away from those… monsters!""

""How do you even know how far they are?"" Annett asked.

""You don't have to be a genius to know more of those *things* will come at us if we don't move!"" Lennard barked.

""They're watching us! Don't you see! None of you see! It's always watching!"" Anna shouted, catching Annett and Lennard's attention.

Hailey shrank back, tears welling in her eyes. She looked like she was about to cry.

Again with the hurtful words to a child. Even after he'd already been given a warning. Gale's vision already becoming red from just hearing those shitty words.

""That's enough.""

Lennard turned his glare on Gale. ""Oh, look who's talking. It's all your fault we're in this mess in the first place!""

""Enough,"" Gale glared at Lennard. ""Knock it off and fuck off.""

Lennard sneered. ""Who's going to stop me? You? I've seen what you can do. You're nothing but a monster in human skin.""

All those shitty years in the orphanage. Told he was a monster. Outcast by the very same kids that he wanted to be friends with when all his friends were just mom and dad. Kids were kids. This asshole in front of him was an adult.

Gale looked around the convoy. Everyone was tired. None even batted an eye at the scene Lennard was causing. They all pulled their own weight, not even complaining as everyone knew it was literally life or death. What's complaining going to do? Nothing.

People can call him a monster, but he didn't want to hear **anyone** tell a child she's unwanted. And this old man in front of him told that child to die.

""Everyone's alive. You included. All you do is complain. Look at the others,"" he said quietly. ""You should be grateful to us you're not in a beast's belly by now.""

""Gratefulness to a monst—""

Before Lennard could finish the last word, Gale's fist connected with his jaw. The older man fell backwards, blood dripping down from his lips.

Now here comes the stressful part. One of my uncles has passed away and we need to attend the funeral and she will be there. My entire family wants to address the situation and have us make up again. I am tired and exhausted of her treating me like a piece of garbage or I’m mad that you can step all over And this is my final straw. Her mom, my aunt has also not spoken to me for an entire year. I’m really just thinking about cutting them off not even attending my uncle’s funeral so I don’t have to see them. 

The problem is I don’t tend to speak up when people are hurting me. I sit there and take it until I snap and when I snap people always remember just me being aggressive and no one else hurting me over and over again.

I am not sure what to do, but I don’t want to rebuild a relationship with somebody who constantly hurts me, then cries and begs for forgiveness then does the same thing over and over again

Any advice would be appreciated because I don’t think I’m the asshole in this situation .",1,1767892631.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

# Features

This coffee maker is designed for speed, precision, and versatility. It begins brewing in just 3 seconds with precise temperature control between 196 and 205°F and can brew up to 8 cups of coffee in only 6 minutes. It also keeps coffee warm between 176 and 185°F for up to 40 minutes, making it ideal for busy mornings, offices, or weekend gatherings. The unit features a full aluminum alloy body and is BPA free and PFAS free, ensuring a safer, non toxic brewing experience with no unwanted residual odors. In addition to hot coffee, it offers a professional 20 minute deep infusion cold brew process that produces smoother and richer iced coffee compared to standard iced coffee makers. A 1250ml removable water tank and detachable components such as the carafe, filter holder, and shower head make cleaning quick and easy. The magnetic anti drip design helps prevent spills, while the adjustable manual flow control allows for pre infusion and multi stage brewing. The large 70g filter basket supports both metal and paper filters, giving users flexibility to experiment with different brewing styles.

# Unboxing and Setup

Unboxing the product was pretty simple, and the unit along with all breakable parts were packaged very well. Everything was wrapped in plastic to prevent damage during shipping. Inside the box you will find an instruction booklet, three paper filters, a double sized spoon, the filter basket, removable water tank, and glass carafe. After glancing over the instructions, I found the way some measurements were worded to be a bit confusing, but doing some simple conversions made it easier to understand. I did appreciate that Kismile includes a few paper filters to get you started, since most consumers will not have cone style filters on hand.

https://preview.redd.it/c5fljshas5cg1.jpg?width=1073&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=382819edfbc0ca67d88c86cd02e904fdc8b05e8d

Setting up the unit was straightforward. The filter basket is magnetic and clicks securely into the unit, with a lid that sits on top. From there, I filled the water tank with distilled water and ran a brew cycle without coffee. I always recommend doing this first to flush the system. I personally use distilled water to avoid mineral buildup on internal components. The brew completed within a few minutes and the machine signaled completion with a couple of beeps. After that, I went ahead and set the unit up for the next morning. I opened the drip stop fully and used my usual ratio of three scoops of coffee to four cups of water. The adjustable drip stop allows water to steep longer in the grounds for a stronger and bolder cup, but I wanted to start fully open to get a baseline brew. At that point, the unit was ready for fresh coffee the next morning.

# My Thoughts

As an extremely avid coffee connoisseur, I can confidently say this coffee maker produces a great cup of coffee. There were a few things I learned along the way. The lack of a brew delay timer is noticeable, especially at this price point, and it would be a nice feature for many users. I also chose to order a reusable mesh cone filter from Amazon. I prefer not to rely on paper filters since the cost and waste can add up over time. I did not notice a significant taste difference between paper and mesh filters during my testing.

https://preview.redd.it/84eryaubs5cg1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77a13770abe06e1b02deda79d2c7c298948b0e05

This coffee maker brews my typical four cup pot very quickly, usually finishing within just a couple of minutes. I eventually experimented with the adjustable drip stop and found that setting it closer to the lowest flow produced a stronger brew that suited my taste perfectly. The biggest feature of this machine is the pour over style brewing, which is very different from a standard drip coffee maker. Pour over brewing gives you far more control over extraction. Water is distributed more slowly and evenly across the grounds, allowing for proper pre infusion or blooming. This helps release trapped gases before full extraction and results in better flavor clarity, smoother taste, and more balanced strength. Traditional drip coffee makers tend to use a fixed water flow with less precision, which can lead to uneven extraction and flatter tasting coffee. The ability to control flow rate and brewing stages is why pour over brewing is often preferred by coffee enthusiasts who want a more customizable cup.

Cleaning is generally very easy. Everything except the water tank is dishwasher safe, while the tank itself must be hand washed. One issue I did notice is that the filter basket tends to trap water internally. No matter how much draining or cleaning I did, some moisture remained inside. Leaving it upside down in the sink for a day or two eventually allowed it to drain, but I do have long term concerns about possible mold or grime buildup since there does not appear to be a way to fully disassemble it.

https://preview.redd.it/2h7czkads5cg1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e897af551857eccb751c2095b7e5e992f2d28c6e

Another concern is parts availability. Many of us have experienced dropping a glass coffee carafe on tile and watching it shatter. With larger, more established brands, replacement pots are usually easy to find online. At the time of posting this review, I could not find a replacement carafe sold separately by Kismile. This particular carafe is also unique because it contains a magnet that interacts with the filter basket to control dripping when the pot is removed. For a smaller brand, long term parts availability is something worth considering before purchasing.

# Conclusion 

Overall, the Kismile 8 Cup Pour Over Drip Coffee Maker delivers an impressive brewing experience, especially for those who care about flavor and control. The pour over style brewing sets it apart from traditional drip machines and consistently produces a smooth, well balanced, and customizable cup of coffee. It heats quickly, brews fast, and offers features like adjustable flow control and cold brew that are not commonly found in standard coffee makers. While the lack of a delay timer and concerns about long term parts availability are worth noting, the quality of the coffee it produces easily stands out. For coffee enthusiasts who want more involvement in the brewing process without fully manual pour over, this machine strikes a solid balance between convenience and control.

1q7hmlk,https://open.substack.com/pub/davidrmann3/p/the-linkedin-strategy-that-filled?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&utm_medium=web,The LinkedIn Strategy That Filled Our Private Dining Room,"**The LinkedIn Strategy That Filled Our Private Dining Room**

The room held 30. Old brick, wood, heavy door. Sound died inside. It felt like the kind of space where deals close and people say what they believe. On the books, it looked like a vanity project. For months, it sat dark while we ran full on the main floor. This is the story of how we stopped waiting and started using LinkedIn like a sales channel. In less than ninety days, the room was booked solid.

**The Problem: A Beautiful Room, Bad Pipeline**

Private dining should sit in the high-margin, low-risk category. Industry research shows venues using dedicated event systems see private event booking revenue rise 30% or more, with higher check averages and predictable revenue. The reality looked nothing like that.​

Most inquiries came from OpenTable and its website. People asked about birthdays and showers. Corporate planners never showed up. We lived on LinkedIn.

Most operators don’t believe that. They still trust walk-ins and hope. Meanwhile, business dining spend worldwide grew 14% between 2023 and 2024, outpacing regular consumer dining by 10%. Business diners spend more per check, book in advance, and come in groups. They turn your slow Tuesdays into payroll.​

If you’re in Seattle or any tech-heavy market, that matters even more. The same reports that describe a rebound in business dining also describe 450 shuttered restaurants across Seattle in the first half of 2025. The room that fills with corporate events survives. The room that waits for birthdays doesn’t.​

**What Most Operators Get Wrong About LinkedIn**

When restaurant people open LinkedIn, they see a foreign country. They see tech workers talking about product roadmaps. Consultants selling frameworks. They don’t see tables or prep lists. So they write one of three kinds of posts. A hiring post. An award post. A food photo with an Instagram caption. Then they log off. They say LinkedIn doesn’t work for restaurants.

Meanwhile, 89% of B2B marketers use LinkedIn for lead generation, and 62% report it generates leads for them. Brands grow followers by five to ten times, generate steady inbound leads per month, and close deals without heavy ad spend.​

The problem isn’t the platform. The problem is how restaurants show up. Most operators send hospitality messages into a sales environment and hope the algorithm feels sentimental.

**The Reversal: Treat LinkedIn Like a Section**

We stopped thinking of LinkedIn as marketing. We treated it like a section in the dining room. The question changed from how do we promote the restaurant to which humans within walking distance hold corporate cards, offsite budgets, or team event authority.

That shift made the work concrete. It gave us a target list. It stripped out the ego. Nobody cared about our food photos. They cared about their problems. Offsites. Team morale. Quarterly Business Review dinners. Sales Presentations. Board meetings. Business dining data shows that most corporate transactions fall between $250 and $5,000 and often center on training sessions and celebrations. The people who approve those expenses scroll LinkedIn between calls.​

If you treat LinkedIn like a shift, your job is simple. You greet. You ask real questions. You create solutions. You follow up. You don’t post once a month and hope.

**The Meta Move: Posting About LinkedIn on LinkedIn**

We told people, on LinkedIn, exactly how we were using LinkedIn to fill the room. We didn’t tell people to look at a steak. We told people that this room sat empty 35 nights last quarter. Here is what we’re doing on LinkedIn to turn it into the best offsite space within fifteen minutes of your office.

We also told people, If you handle team events, I want your job to feel easier. Here is the template we use with planners to quote a private dinner in five minutes, no phone tag.

These posts did three specific jobs. They signaled that we understood LinkedIn as a professional space. They positioned the restaurant as a partner instead of a vendor. They turned our own marketing strategy into value for the reader. A revenue leader reads about business dining spend growing in double digits. She sees a post about how we handle dietary restrictions for leadership teams. She comments. Her comment exposes the post to her network. Her colleague runs customer success. He needs a room for a Quarterly Business Review. The room has another shot at a Tuesday night.

**The Playbook: Exact Tactics That Filled the Room**

**Build A Local Linkedin Map**

Start with a spreadsheet. Columns. Name. Company. Role. Budget Type. Office Location. LinkedIn URL. Last Interaction. Next Step. Budget Type had three options. Travel and sales, for people who host client dinners and QBRs. People and culture, for individuals who own off-sites and team-building events. Executive operations, for chiefs of staff and executive assistants. Business dining trends show significant spending sits in transactions between $250 and $10,000. You need the hundred smaller events between $250 and $5,000 where planners feel constant friction.​

Use simple search filters. People tab. City. Region. Keywords. Events. Field Marketing. Customer Success. People Operations. Chief Of Staff. Set the first target at one hundred names within a reasonable time. This was our new walk-in list.

**Connect Like A Human, Not A Brochure**

Connection messages had one rule. No pitch. Hey Sarah. You run field events for a lot of teams in South Lake Union. I run a private dining program a few miles away. I share logistics ideas here sometimes. Thought it might be useful for you. Either way, nice to connect.

Short. Specific. Honest. That tone lines up with best practices from B2B LinkedIn research, where personalized outreach paired with helpful content led to sharp reductions in cost per opportunity and large pipeline growth. If they accept, we don’t pitch five minutes later. We treated the connection like a guest who just sat down. Water first. Getting to know you conversation next. Sales information later.​

**Post Three Times A Week**

Three content lanes. Operator honesty, posts for restaurant people about labor, food cost, and leadership. Planner-focused utility, posts aimed at people who book events. Detailed. Logistics-heavy. No fluff. Meta LinkedIn content, posts about how we use LinkedIn for B2B restaurant sales.

Schedule. Three posts per week. One from each lane. No exceptions. Brands that grow and close deals on LinkedIn publish consistently, mix educational content with social proof, and keep a heavy text presence.​

Our planner-focused posts. Three things your next offsite dinner should have. One: A clear arrival window and host instructions for late stragglers. Two: Pre-selected shared plates that cover vegan, gluten-free, and dairy-free options without separate menus. Three: One point of contact on our side and yours. No email chains.

Our meta posts. LinkedIn filled twelve out of fourteen private dining nights last month. No ads. No discounts. Here is what we did. One: Built a list of one hundred local planners. Two: Posted three logistics posts per week for ninety days. Three: Asked every satisfied planner to leave a LinkedIn comment instead of a secret email.

Those posts drew attention from both sides. Operators messaged with questions. Planners messaged with dates. The content didn’t look like restaurant marketing. It looked like work notes written in public.

Show evidence that matters to B2B buyers

For planners, proof looks different. They want reliability. Will the room be set on time? Will the AV work? They want predictability. Will the invoice match the quote? They want recognition. Will their boss be impressed?

We showed those through specific signals. Screenshots of floor plans with anonymized client names. Check averages and total spend ranges for anonymized recent events. Quotes from planners who hosted events, shared with permission. Industry reports show that business diners spend up to 50% more per check and often drive higher lifetime value when they engage through digital booking channels.​

Our numbers matched that pattern. Average private dining check: $4,200. Food costs are lower than main floor because of pre-set menus. Labor is slightly higher per event but lower per cover. Deposits were collected weeks ahead.​

When we talked about ROI on LinkedIn, we showed those numbers. We hosted eight private events this month through LinkedIn relationships. Revenue $32,800. $9,000 in deposits collected in advance. Net operating income on those nights was stronger than any other revenue stream in the building. Zero spent on ads. Total time invested on LinkedIn. 30 minutes a day. Monday through Friday.

Business dining benchmarks back up that story. Reports describe private dining as high-margin, lower-risk revenue with strong contribution to stability, especially when supported by digital channels.​

When you talk about Return On Investment with this level of detail, the conversation changes. Owners stop asking whether social media helps raise awareness. They ask what happens to Net Operating Income if you double the number of planners on your list.

**Seattle Reality: Why This Matters Here**

Seattle sits in a strange place. You have large employers with global footprints and travel budgets. Tech, retail, and coffee giants anchored in the region drive business dining spend. On the other side, you have tech layoffs, rising vacancies, and a hospitality sector hit by reduced discretionary spend. About 450 restaurants closed in Seattle during the first half of 2025, tied to reduced spending in tech-heavy districts.​

Both are true. Which means this: The safest path for a private dining room in Greater Seattle doesn’t run through Instagram or hope. It runs through the living, breathing network of professionals who still need to host clients, teams, and visitors even when headcounts shrink. Those people spend corporate money, not personal money. They answer to leadership, not Yelp. They live on LinkedIn.

**What Changed: From Dark Nights to Waitlist**

Before LinkedIn. Average private dining utilization was about 35% of available prime-time slots in a quarter. Mix mostly social events. Few repeat corporate bookings.

After LinkedIn. Utilization moved north of 70% in key weeks. Corporate share of events climbed above half of total bookings. Repeat rate increased as planners returned each quarter. Those numbers track with broader private dining performance patterns, where structured programs and digital lead pipelines produce meaningful revenue growth.​

The room stopped feeling like a side project. It became its own P&L. Planners arrived at the first site visit already aligned. They had read about our approach to set menus and dietary restrictions. They didn’t ask for endless customizations. They asked how closely we could match what we had described.

Line cooks felt the difference. Private events turned from chaos to repetition. The team saw clear menus, accurate counts, and predictable pacing. Instead of hating events, they started to fight for those shifts. LinkedIn didn’t make service easier. Discipline did. LinkedIn gave that discipline a channel.

**The Behavior Shift You Start Today**

You don’t need a full program by Friday. You need one change. Here is the move.

Today, open your LinkedIn. Search for events plus your city. Add ten people who obviously handle events, people, or sales at companies within a reasonable drive. Send each a short, honest note that respects their work and hints at the problems you solve. Then write one post that speaks to a planner’s headache, not your menu.

Tomorrow, repeat.

Do that. LinkedIn will either be your strongest new revenue channel for private events, or you’ll have something more honest than an opinion. You’ll have numbers. If you do this with discipline, based on what the data already shows about business dining and private events, those numbers will surprise you.​

How do I get him to see what I see and stop being so fucking lazy?



I'm not really sure where to start with this so I'll do my best to not repeat myself unnecessarily. We have been dating for almost 2yrs now. We don't live together, we're almost an hour apart. I stay at his place every weekend since he has pets that can't be taken over to my place for the weekend (fish, for example). I am a very clean, tidy, and organized person. My place isn't spotless or perfect, but it's clean and organized. My home is peaceful and organized and I can breathe in it. I like it and have always found unorganized environments to be very stressful for me. It gives me so much anxiety being in dirty and unclean environments. I realize this is a first world problem, but this is my standard. It's what I grew up with and it's what I'm comfortable with. Clutter and trash hurts my mental health and I end up circling back to my OCD tendencies, which hurts me more. I end up washing my hands until they're raw. I get incredibly irritable. I get cleaning and can't stop until it's ALL done. It hurts my mental health to have to bear all of that and I work until I cry from frustration, which I have been more of lately at his house.

I don't know how my boyfriend grew up, but his place is the opposite. He isn't clean or tidy. He doesn't put things away, he puts things down. When I do things, like laundry, I wash, dry, fold, and put it away same day, albeit sometimes the next day, but you get the point. Boyfriend will wash and dry and let his clothes get wrinkly in the hamper until it's almost empty and his dirty clothes have piled up on the floor. I don't even know why he has a dresser. When I bring the mail in, I sort it and recycle flyers. Boyfriend dumps it all by the door and leaves it there until either I ask him to put it away or I do it myself. If it's garbage day and I'm there, I will bring the bin to the backyard. He will roll it about 3 meters off the curb onto the front lawn and leave it beside my flower garden until next garbage day, killing the grass. I put my shoes away in the shoe rack, yet I have to stumble over his shoes unless I put them away myself or ask him to do it.  When I brush my teeth, I lean over the sink to make sure I'm not making a mess. Boyfriend drips spit and toothpaste on the floor and edge of the sink/counter so it's a huge white streak leading down to a bunch of nasty shit on the floor right below the sink. When I work in the garden, I wash my hands over and in the sink and give it a little splash when I'm done to make sure the dirt isn't just sitting in the sink. Boyfriend washes his dirty hands like he's in a facewash commercial and leaves grime all over the sink and when he shaves he leaves hair everywhere. When I cook, I clean the dishes as I go and wipe the counters and stove when I'm done. I wipe my spills and sweep my crumbs, if need be. Boyfriend piles up dishes and lets them sit for days sometimes. He can't even be bothered to rinse them so they're less of a bitch to wash, despite me asking many times. He doesn't wipe up his mess when he's done cooking either. Sauce, crumbs, and spills on the floor will stay there until I ask him to clean up after himself. I don't ask him for perfection (because I realize my standard is higher than most), and I don't critique his work when he has done what I've asked. I thank him for wiping the stove even if he left streaks of sauce. I thank him for wiping the sticky fingers off the fridge even if I'm still getting shit on my hands when I touch the handle. I thank him for putting his clothes in the hamper. I shouldn't have to and I know this.

  
When we first started dating, I gave him the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe it was a depression slump, since he did mention that was having a hard time. I cleaned the house, I vacuumed, I kept up with dishes, and I was working to keep up with him. I have been frustrated to tears by his actions, including the last time I cleaned the whole bathroom and he shaved and got hair everywhere without bothering to even try to clean it up. I have explained to him how this hurts me so mentally and why. I have walked him through the house after I've cleaned it to show him everything I've done, hoping he will both notice and maintain the work. He doesn't. I do my best to model the environment I feel comfortable in by cleaning up after myself. Yes, I have talked to him about starting antidepressants. No, he doesn't want to and thinks he's functioning fine without them. I have been on antidepressants since I was 18 or 19 and have been doing quite well on them.

  
He made a comment last week that has been rubbing me the wrong way. We went to a clothing swap with a bunch of friends (basically we all bring clothes we're going to donate and let our friend group go through it first). I was ahead of him so when I was done looking at an item, I folded it and sorted the clothes into piles. None of that matters and I didn't do it for him. It's just what I do. I unfold something, I'm going to fold it up when I'm done with it. I'm not going to leave it in a pile. It's just a me thing. Boyfriend went through the piles after me and made a snide comment to one of my friends that I was going to ask him to refold things nicer (I don't remember how exactly he worded it but it was unnecessarily snippy). I have never asked him to fold his clothes ""nicer"" and explained to him that I've only ever asked him to put his clothes away and that I don't care what it looks like because I don't have to look at it in his drawers. I explained to him that all I have ever asked is that he stops dumping dirty clothes on the floor and that he puts clean clothes away to avoid the dirty clothes heap. I have never even commented on the quality of his folds. If he were folding my laundry, sure, I'd probably say something or fix it myself, but I don't want him to fold my clothes so lazily or leave them wrinkled in a heap for a week, so I do it myself. I can't and don't expect him to fold my clothes to own standard, so I don't. I thank him every time he DOES put his clothes where they belong. I said this all to him in less words and  made sure it was respectful and not snippy back since it was in front of a few friends, but he still had this look on his face that looked like he wanted to roll his eyes but couldn't because our friends were there and it would make things more tense than it was at that point. It really rubbed me the wrong way. He's never made a comment like that before. I've been thinking about that interaction for days now and I'm still upset about it. I don't know why he would say such a thing. I think he may have pent up irritability about me having to constantly ask him to clean up his shit and put it away................................................ which wouldn't be a problem if he would just be responsible and do it.

I am beginning to feel resentment toward his lack of ability to simply put shit away and clean up after himself. I know there's a term for men like this - manchild - and I'm not going to parent this man for the rest of my life. I have never called him a manchild and I have never called him lazy. Sometimes it seems like he genuinely doesn't notice these things that I do, and other times he literally steps over his own garbage. Like, WHY can't you just PICK IT UP and PUT IT AWAY? It's beginning to anger me when I see him completely ignore or disregard something that I have asked him about and modeled myself. I've explained to him many times how much it hurts me when he cooks and leaves a mess that I then have to clean before I can use the kitchen. I have explained that I'd rather not have a bench at the door ""to sit on while putting on your shoes"" (his words not mine) if all it's there for is collecting junk. There hasn't been room to sit on the bench for months simply because I stopped cleaning up his junk and haven't asked him to clean it up. I have explained to him that I would rather have no coffee table than a table that collects literal garbage and junk and leaves no room for me to put a glass down without cleaning shit off. He always has to put his plate on the floor and clean a spot off the garbage/junk table so he can put his plate there to eat. I have explained many times that it hurts when he doesn't show the same basic etiquette. I make a mess, I clean it up and leave a blank slate for the next person. He makes a mess, it stays there until I say something or clean it myself. I have to clean up a mess in almost every space in the house before I can use it. I have to clean the table to eat. I have to clean the kitchen to cook. I have to put shoes away to not trip on them. He listens and he visibly gets upset/sad and apologizes but it just doesn't last longer than a week before he's off the rail again. He suggested a ""chore list"" to help him, but I disagree about it being useful when he literally steps over his messes and ignores them. It's nothing but a burden on me to make and enforce because the chores are RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM and he chooses to ignore them. I don't see how or why a list would help, but please correct me if I'm wrong or let me know if you have any useful chore designation/list ideas. 

  
I am SO SO SO SO frustrated. I have been frustrated to tears and so overwhelmed that I just can't function in his house. I have cleaned it top to bottom many times only to find he's undone all of my hard work and tears in a matter of days. I have never asked that he cleans anything to my standard. Is there something else I can do to help him come to his senses and see how much he's hurting me and burdening me??? I have sat him down and talked about it until I've cried and he still can't/won't keep up with his own messes. I can't either anymore and his house is in such disarray that I don't even want to be there. It does nothing but stress me out and I'm done cleaning up after him. I'm overwhelmed and I just feel like crying in that environment. I've explained to him that when his house looks like this, I am paralyzed with the inability to do anything because I have to do EVERYTHING before I can do anything anywhere. Is there any way to get through to him?? Any way I can show my lens on this?? Anything I can say or do to help him??",2,1767892550.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

1q7hkkh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leatherworking/comments/1q7hkkh/picking_the_right_leather_leather_durability/,Picking The Right Leather & Leather Durability?,"Hey all, I prowl this forum a lot to get inspo and I'm looking to glean some strategy from the more versed.

  
I do all sorts of small projects but right now it's primarily book binding since I volunteer at a mid-sized church. I started with one or two and then got a line of people wanting different leathers, which pretty quickly brought me to my current situation:

  
Many of the most beautiful leathers are also easily scratchable, shiny, or delicate. The most popular leathers I used are the renowned Badalassi Carlo -- and I quickly realized the waxed version would probably be a bit more durable. However, it turns out the regular leathers get bruised and the waxed ones get scratched.

  
So two big questions

1. How do you pick your leathers? What should you / shouldn't you use for a project like a book, that gets used daily, shoved in backpacks, coffee spills on it sometimes, etc..

2. I look at common leather items like cowboy boots and they seem virtually indestructible and unscratchable. Are they doing something to their leather? Is there anything I can do? I noticed once after spilling water and trying to rub it, it caused a mild color change but a pretty major texture change where it appeared to almost... harden? I'm not quite sure. I'd like any thoughts on this.

A neighbor recommended paulas home and living, and I checked their site for home decor. I found the Clara Throw in acrylic for $65, which is soft and easy to wash, plus the Tui Coaster Set in glass for $25 to protect my coffee table, and the Beach Stained Glass Hanger at $49 to add some color to the walls. I ordered those last week to start filling out the space.

What colors work well for throws in rooms with gray tones? For the bedrooms, I plan to get more cushions and maybe a clock that fits a modern look, but I want pieces that won't fade in the sun.

Getting there I drove a fairly busy road, and off to the side at one point you could see the top of a tall thin concrete structure (some weird building project that never got finished).  The cafe/restaurant had a large wrap around balcony/outdoor area that let you look at the mountains to the east, but also had a good view of the valley to the west.

1q7hhtl,https://i.redd.it/rp6x4taer5cg1.jpeg,"In-Hand Review: Stussy Dice Knit is a 10/10, but mixed feelings on the CH Jeans 🎲 (ft. Supreme, Nike, Amiri)","1. Chrome Hearts Multi-Color Cross Trucker Hat**

**Rating:** 7/10
**Review:** It’s a loud piece. The colors on the crosses are vibrant, and the mesh quality is standard—breathable and decent for hot weather. However, the print on the foam front feels a little plasticky, like it might crack or peel after a summer of wear. The silver button on top is a nice detail, but overall it feels a bit lightweight compared to other CH caps I’ve handled.
**Fit:** Standard snapback fit. Sits a bit high on the head.

### **2. New Era NY Yankees Fitted (Side Patch)**

**Rating:** 9/10
**Review:** Can’t go wrong with a classic. The embroidery on the NY logo and the side patch is super clean—no loose threads or connected stitching. The brim came with a standard flat shape but curved easily. The wool blend feels structured and durable. Not much to complain about here, it does exactly what it's supposed to do.
**Fit:** True to size. Fits my head shape perfectly without pinching.

### **3. Nike Tech Fleece Jacket (Grey/Black)**

**Rating:** 8/10
**Review:** The color blocking on this is sick, gives it a more aggressive look than the solid grey ones. Material is smooth and comfortable, standard Tech Fleece quality. My only gripe is the main zipper; it feels a little stiff and catches slightly near the bottom. Hopefully, it loosens up with wear.
**Fit:** Fits slim. At 180cm, the Medium is a perfect fitted look, but if you want to layer a hoodie underneath, you might struggle. Length is spot on.

### **4. Chrome Hearts Black Tonal Cross Jeans**

**Rating:** 8.5/10
**Review:** These are way more wearable than the blue ones (see #6). The black-on-black patches are subtle and the leather crosses feel decent quality. The denim itself is heavy and rigid, which I like. The buttonhole was incredibly tight, had to fight it to get them open the first time. The wash looks authentic.
**Fit:** Waist is TTS. The length stacks nicely on my Jordans without dragging on the floor.

### **5. Supreme Box Logo Hoodie (Black)**

**Rating:** 7.5/10
**Review:** The blank on this is heavy and stiff—definitely a winter hoodie. The box logo embroidery is centered and straight, no floating 'e'. However, the neck hole is surprisingly tight/small. It’s a struggle to get my head through without messing up my hair. It’s a classic piece, but the comfort isn’t 10/10 due to the stiffness.
**Fit:** Boxy fit. Sleeves are a tiny bit short for my arms (180cm), but the chest is roomy.

### **6. Chrome Hearts Blue Patch Jeans**

**Rating:** 5/10
**Review:** Honestly, not feeling these as much in hand. The craftsmanship is fine, but the design is just too loud in person. The ""CHROME HEARTS"" text across the back is huge and the blue leather patches contrast too much for daily wear. The denim feels slightly thinner than the black pair (#4) as well. Hard to style without looking like a walking billboard.
**Fit:** Fits same as the black pair, straight leg cut.

### **7. Stussy Dice Knit Sweater**

**Rating:** 9.5/10
**Review:** Favorite item of the haul. The knit is surprisingly soft and not itchy at all against bare skin. The dice graphic is woven in clearly, not just printed on top. It has a nice weight to it and drapes really well. Feels like a quality garment that will last a long time.
**Fit:** Slightly oversized/relaxed. The perfect baggy fit for my build.

### **8. Amiri ""Imagination"" Hoodie**

**Rating:** 6/10
**Review:** A bit disappointed with this one. For an ""Amiri"" piece, the blank feels kinda thin and flimsy compared to the Supreme or Carhartt hoodies. The print is okay, but it feels like it might fade after a few washes. It looks cool, but the quality doesn't match the aesthetic. It feels more like a fast-fashion hoodie than a luxury rep.
**Fit:** Fits slightly cropped and wide.

### **9. Carhartt WIP Embroidered Hoodie (Cream)**

**Rating:** 10/10
**Review:** Best bang for your buck. The cream color is beautiful in person (though I’m terrified of spilling coffee on it). The ""Carhartt"" embroidery is thick and premium. The fleece lining is super soft. It’s simple, clean, and feels indestructible.
**Fit:** TTS. Not too boxy, not too slim. Sleeves hit perfectly at the wrist.

### **10. Stussy Arch Logo Hoodie (Black/Yellow)**

**Rating:** 8.5/10
**Review:** Another solid Stussy piece. The yellow text pops really nicely against the black. The logo is a chenille-style texture which adds some nice depth. It’s a good daily driver hoodie. Cuffs are nice and tight, holding the sleeves up well.
**Fit:** Fits similar to the Carhartt one, maybe a little looser in the chest area. Ideal for a relaxed street fit.

***What price would you pay to be yourself?***

**The frontier planet Celestine, millennia from now.** Two months after the events of *In the Valley, A Shadow*, Alix and her crew are in hiding from the menacing Xypha Corporation.

As the crew works to repair her ship, the *Shadow*, outside a remote mining town, demons from her past are on the hunt, seeking revenge.

Jailed by the local lawman, Alix hatches a reckless plan to escape and return home to the Isidis Valley. There, she comes face-to-face with the bloody consequences of her actions.

Facing down the man who raised her, Alix must reckon with the woman she's become. Can she save the people and planet she loves, or will her lust for violence drag them deeper beneath Xypha's terrifying shadow?

**About the author: We recommend looking for street parking in the jewelry district and/or on Green St, which is off Weybosset, because both areas usually have ample spots available and the garages downtown charge far too much!**

Samantha Tano is a transgender science fiction author based in Rhode Island. She has worked as an award-winning journalist and development editor.

1q7hh97,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1q7hh97/furniture_suggestions_for_a_new_house/,Furniture suggestions for a new house?,"I moved from the US to New Zealand last year and bought a three-bedroom house in Auckland with an open-plan living and kitchen area, plus a small backyard deck. The place has high ceilings and lots of natural light from big windows, but the floors are hardwood that scratch easily, so I need pieces that won't mark them up. I started by buying basics like a queen bed frame and mattress for the master room to get settled right away.

What height works best for side tables next to a standard sofa? In the living room, I picked up a gray fabric three-seater sofa that's comfortable for movie nights, and I added a coffee table with storage drawers to keep remotes and books organized. For the dining spot, I got an extendable oak table from paulas home and living that seats six but expands for guests, matching the neutral tones I want throughout.

How do you protect wooden floors under heavy chairs? I plan to get a couple of armchairs for reading corners in the bedrooms, maybe in leather for easy cleaning since we have a dog. The kitchen needs bar stools that fit under the island counter, around 65cm high, and I'm thinking metal ones with cushions for comfort during meals.

What storage options fit well in a narrow hallway? Next up is outdoor furniture for the deck, like a four-seater table set with weatherproof cushions to handle the rain here. I already have lamps for each room, but I want to add a floor lamp in the living area for better evening light without harsh overheads.

How do you choose rugs that don't slide on hardwood? For the guest room, I'm looking at a double bed with under-bed drawers to save space, and maybe a wardrobe since built-ins are limited. Overall, I'm aiming for a mix of modern and cozy styles that last in this humid climate without costing too much.",1,1767892250.0,homeowners,1,1.0,False

This is gonna be a long one .

My family is traditionally Caribbean and family always comes first . 

I was raised in a household with my grandmother along with my cousins so we function like siblings.

My older Girl cousin got has some tendencies to make things all about her . We have had many a fights over the years . A few examples 

Telling me I wouldn’t be where I was if her mom never helped me go to school (then leaving me alone in another country that I don’t know while she had coffee with her friend ignoring me).

Traveled back home together with her and her friends and her man and she ignored me half the trip 

Making food for everyone in the house but me but then acting oblivious like she never ment to do it.

We flew to our home country to do some wedding planning for her and she texted her man about how Much she had to walk on egg shells around me and how I always ruin her vybe and if she could drive she could take my dads car and drive ( I flew down specifically to help her and borrowed my dads car to drive her around the island) . 

Then proceeded to get mad at me that i wasn’t inside the salon with her the enter time she was getting her hair done and her make up done . ( I had stepped outside because my friend who had not seen me in a year stopped by) .

Her wedding was a year later and she bearly spoke to me after the trip. She then would only message me when she needed me to do something or a pay for something for her wedding. I tried to clear the air about the trip and we both admitted where we went wrong even though I don’t think I did anything incorrectly and apologize. Thinking that was all behind us. I was really surprised that she was so dry with me after the trip and after our our long conversation. now fast-forward to the wedding, she wanted to do a bridal shower two months before her wedding and I had not budgeted for that please keep in mind. I have now spent approximately $4000 for this wedding. I had asked her previously if she won the bridal shower so I can budget to save for it. She declined saying it was going to be too expensive. when she came two months before the wedding asking for a bridal shower I told her I had no time as I’m a full-time student and I work full-time and I don’t have the money to pay for a bridal shower with only two months notice. She got upset and said to have her mother-in-law pay for it because I wasn’t able to afford it. 

We got to the island and she wanted to have her bridal shower the day I was flying in. I told her that made no sense because if my flight got delayed, I wouldn’t be able to set up decorations. Plus she was already having a bachelorette party. Across the wedding event, she barely spoke to me was really awkward and didn’t really interact with me even though I was a made of honor She only interacted with her friends and basically ignored me which other family members had picked up on after her wedding, she didn’t speak to me again and has been ignoring me for a solid year.

The wedding had a lot of nightmares such as her yelling at me about my maid of honor her Speech, even though she never told me I had one, ignoring me on her bachelorette party, only talking to her friends, scheduling things doing times when I had classes so I had to take class on my cell phone, etc.

Now here comes the stressful part. One of my uncles has passed away and we need to attend the funeral and she will be there. My entire family wants to address the situation and have us make up again. I am tired and exhausted of her treating me like a piece of garbage or I’m mad that you can step all over And this is my final straw. Her mom, my aunt has also not spoken to me for an entire year. I’m really just thinking about cutting them off not even attending my uncle’s funeral so I don’t have to see them. 

The problem is I don’t tend to speak up when people are hurting me. I sit there and take it until I snap and when I snap people always remember just me being aggressive and no one else hurting me over and over again.

I am not sure what to do, but I don’t want to rebuild a relationship with somebody who constantly hurts me, then cries and begs for forgiveness then does the same thing over and over again

I remember asking others about canonical tags and someone replied like *“Dude, canonical URLs are literally your site’s backbone if you care about ranking.”* At the time I had no idea what that even meant I just figured Google would sort it out. But after spending weeks chasing phantom duplicate content issues (and watching my analytics make less sense than my 8am coffee-deprived brain), I finally got it. It’s wild how many versions of the same page a simple e-commerce site can generate think filters, session IDs, printer-friendly versions all leading to the same core content. Without telling Google “this is the one true version,” you’re basically letting search engines guess which page to rank, and that guess isn’t always in your favor. Someone once said, *“Canonical tags don’t control indexing, they consolidate ranking signals.”* That clicked for me. Before that, I was worried I could magically de-index pages (which you can’t with canonical tags). I learned the hard way that if your canonical points to a 404 or even a redirect, you’re basically telling Google your best page isn’t real, which is the exact opposite of what you want. And yes, I once had my canonical pointing to an HTTPS version that *didn’t exist* yet because someone thought it was “future proofing.” Classic mistake.

Now I always use absolute URLs in my canonical tags no relative paths, no guesswork. I even self-reference canonicals on every page, which feels silly until you realize how many times people strip those out when switching themes or doing redirects. A tip I learned from more experienced SEOs is to check Google Search Console’s index coverage for canonical issues after a launch. It’s saved me from some face-palm moments. Anyway, if you’re struggling with duplicate content or weird analytics splits, canonicals might just be your secret weapon.

1. How much protein I need to have minimum. I am a college student so I can't afford whey and chicken as of now. I get chicken in mess 2 times a week (wed and sun). I can eat eggs as much as they are safe to eat. I can have soya and can cook it too as I have induction. Rest idk  
  
2. What split to use? I am using bro split rn and training 3 set for each exercise. First two sets for 12-13 reps and then last set to failure, doing 4-6 exercises everyday. 

3. What to eat as a pre workout, post workout? I have my lunch minimum 2 hrs before my workout. Then before workout, I have salted water and then black coffee. After workout, I have 4 boiled eggs. Rest, I try to fit everything in my rest of the meals. 

4. Anything else I have to consider? Maybe I am missing something. Please tell

I finally got my hands on the **all-black Replicas**, and honestly, they’re the ultimate ""if you know, you know"" sneaker. I’ve been wanting a pair that I could wear to a nice dinner but also just throw on with jeans for a coffee run, and these hit that spot perfectly.

The first thing you’ll notice is the **mix of textures**. Even though the whole shoe is black, the contrast between the **smooth nappa leather** and the **velvety suede overlays** gives it so much depth. It doesn't look like a flat, boring black shoe at all. When you pick them up, the leather feels incredibly **supple and buttery**—you can tell it’s that high-end Italian quality that’s going to develop a beautiful patina over time.

The color-changing property when you add lemon is genuinely cool, and the taste is pleasant. But I'm skeptical about the health claims that seem to accompany every herbal tea now.



The marketing for herbal teas has gotten elaborate, with specific claimed benefits for every plant. Better skin, improved digestion, reduced stress, enhanced immunity, the promises are extensive and vague. Some are probably backed by traditional use or research, others feel like wellness marketing creating health halos around beverages people just enjoy drinking.



I've found these teas from health food stores to tea specialists to suppliers on platforms like Alibaba offering bulk herbs and flowers. The availability and variety suggest substantial demand for functional beverages. But are people buying them for legitimate health benefits or just enjoying flavored drinks while feeling virtuous about wellness-adjacent choices? What herbal teas have you tried for health versus just enjoyment? Did you notice genuine effects or just placebo satisfaction? How do you evaluate health claims for foods and beverages?

Poof. She sends three men to Wichita.

Three men in black suits freeze mid-step. Sunglasses. Earpieces. One of them visibly reconsiders his life. Another whispers, shaking,
“I swear to God she said, ‘this isn’t a phone, it’s a Lumen.’”

People drifting casually in zero gravity. A DJ playing something that sounds like Daft Punk but legally distinct. A shrimp tower rotating slowly in space.

The clutch was behaving weird from the start of the journey, the car was being jerky in Gear 1 and 2 and after 2 km into the coffee run to a nearby cafe, the gear wasn't slotting anymore. So I pulled over to the side, turned it off and on, it went struggling for another 0.5km and it finally gave out on a downhill section. The car had 7 neutrals at this point, however there was no smell of burnt clutch or anything. It was basically at neutral in each gear at all times. Had to tow it to our parking again about 3km away using Porter app after a kind bloke recommend to do so.

I have a cousin brother who owns a Skoda Kushaq 1.0L TSI with Manual Transmission as well, he was the initial buyer of that car and even faced the EPC issue which was common back then. Funny enough, he has gone through 2 sets of clutch plates before 30k ODO. Upon asking the service center, they blame bad driving style/pattern of the owners. This issue seems to be common among many owners after searching on the internet. 

When I went for a test drive of the Skoda Kylaq AT when it came out, I asked the salesman about this issue on the test-drive and even he agreed on how common it was and that his friend has also gone through 2 sets of clutches under 25k ODO in his 1.0 TSI manual Skoda Kushaq. He was laughing and joking about it.

Why is this issue not more serious than it is? The torque converter/DSG ones are doing fine but the manuals with the 1.0L TSI have a major flaw. Why isn't this being addressed and solved for the thousands of users present? Truly a disappointing experience!",6,1767891639.0,CarsIndia,3,1.0,False

Met this guy in college 8 years ago. I knew he was immediately interested in me. I was not in him. I won’t get into the details as to why, but there were some small white lies I caught onto, he seemed a bit intense/possessive, seemed very status oriented, etc. He asked (texted) me to dinner while we were in school and I never responded. 

He left college early for law school. The past 8 years he’s been in contact (text, Snapchat once) probably annually. Almost every time he eventually asks me out. The last time was exactly a year ago. We never actually went out though because I never respond when it gets to that. I think the biggest reason was always because honestly he just seemed so “into” me it kinda scared me. I’m talking viewing my LinkedIn profile like 5-10 times weekly for a few months.

Anyway, since last year he hasn’t been in contact.

Then I’m starting to think maybe it’s me and I should give people chances, especially seeing how many girls complain about how nonchalant so many guys are. He was the opposite of nonchalant.

We just don't know anyone's true intentions, but I guess my question is are 1st drink dates now frowned on?

I guess it depends on your expectations and what you want from dating, but to me the most awkward ways you can try to get to know a stranger is getting food with them or going to the cinema.

Cracking the bag, I'm getting prominent notes of blueberry and milk chocolate. I'm going to guess it's an Ethiopian bean based on the blueberry, unless it's a co-ferment or something.

For gear, I've been using my ZP6 Special set to about 6.3 or 6.4 and the Colum dripper. Doses at 15g. Water is tap, and unfortunately a little on the hard side at 149ppm, but I haven't been able to mix up my usual Rao-Perger recipe since we moved recently. Brewing between 90-92°C.

My first brew I just went with my typical 3:1 bloom, then circle pours up to 7:1, 11:1, and 15:1. Water at 92°C. TBT was around 2:45. This brew was really harsh and astringent. Sugar tamed things enough for me to taste the blueberry and chocolate, but it wasn't a great cup.

Today's brew I used the same recipe, but the final pour went up to 16:1. I moved the ZP6 one click finer. Brew temp dropped down to 90°C. And I used a Melodrip for all pours after the bloom. TBT was about 2:25 this time. Still getting a little drying astringency, but it's better. Flavors seem a bit weak. Maybe going to 16:1 was the wrong idea here. Sugar brought out some punchy acidity, surprisingly. Improved over yesterday, but it's still very obvious that it isn't dialed in.

So, I'm hoping for some tips from folks who've managed to figure out their brewing recipe on this mystery coffee. Anything that you'd recommend doing or avoiding? How did you get the most from these beans?",2,1767891080.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

But what killed me is that she starts telling this story that seems to be about dating another man post-1st divorce, and then immediately goes all-in describing the Turkish coffee instead 😅

She said she mostly remembers how sweet and thick it was, and she liked it as if that was more memorable than whatever she was saying about the guy!

1q7gnq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/1q7gnq3/my_bullying_story/,My bullying story,"I was (15f) when I smoked weed for the first time. My friends and I snuck out to meet some skater guys on a Friday night because my friend was dating one of them. Brandon picked us up in his white minivan. He was a grade older. We smoked. Nothing crazy happened. 
A few days later I got off at my friends bus stop after school, along with some of the guys. They offered me weed, they made a pipe out of aluminum foil and I only took 1 or 2 hits and I was so messed up. They said I’m going to need to pay 20 for the weed. I said OK, I’ll pay you tomorrow at school. I didn’t even like the high, I went and laid down in my friends bedroom wishing it would go away. I was paranoid about my life choices. Felt like a loser. Later that night, my friend calls me and said Do Not pay them. They were bragging about how the whole bag only costed 20 bucks, and they are trying to rip you off. 
Next day at school I was sitting outside eating lunch with some girls. We were the only table outside eating. Theese girls were some real nerdy, goodie good type girls, straight A honor students. 2 guys came outside, the minivan guy and some guy I never seen before, not the guy I owed money to.. he sent his friends. I stand up and say “I’m not paying you, you are trying to rip me off.” Random guy said “if you do not give me the money, I am going to take you over there and curb stomp your face into the sewer.” I fumbled around in my backpack and shoved the Money towards him. 
Those girls went straight to the principles office. Next thing I know, I am in the office. I tried to lie, but they told me they already know the truth, no need to lie. So I told them. 
The guy who threatened me, causing a scene, was suspended.
The guy who I owed money to, was expelled. 
That entire group of skater kids were so mad at ME. Saying it’s all my fault that he was expelled. They bullied me for the rest of freshman year and all throughout sophomore year. On my first day of sophomore year, I was placed in a computer keyboarding class right smack dab next to Brandon the minivan guy. He was the ring leader of the bullies, I never reported him to the teacher because I had a secret crush on him, I think I had Stockholm syndrome! He made fun of me at school, and at home at night messaging me on AIM, pretending he had the hotts for me, calling me jiggles as like a pet name. A girl I never even met before was saying I shoved a charter TV remote up my you know what. That is NOT TRUE. I’m literally a virgin, nothing is going up there. They threw chips at me in lunch when I had no money to buy food, saying “I know your hungry fatass!” They just said so many horrible things to me and embarassed me in class. I never stood up for myself. I didn’t say anything. One day my I came out of keyboarding class and my friend in the hall saw the tears streaming down my face. She screamed at Brandon down the hall, just like she had done in the past. I couldn’t take it anymore and I cried my eyes out all throughout lunch and all throughout the rest of the keyboarding class. (It was a split class) my face was beat red. Tears, snot and make up ruined. All while sitting next to the jerk that caused it who I thought I loved so much. The bullying stopped. It was complete silence for now. 
A few years after high school, he found my friend on MySpace asking how he can get ahold of me. I contacted him on there. He asked if he can meet me at Starbucks tomorrow because he wanted to talk to me about something. I go, wondering if this is finally my chance. He buys me a coffee. He tells me he is in AA now and wants to apologize for how he treated me. I spill my coffee down my white freaking T shirt. Before he leaves I say “wait, did you know I had a crush on you all that time?” He nods, then we leave. I never see him again except in passing at community college. He waved. We talked once in awhile on MySpace messenger, I asked him to hang out once but that never happened. 
We are almost 40 now and I searched his court records online today, wondering if he was forced to be in AA due to a DWI, or if ge did it because he truly wanted to. What I found out was… he was in prison 2 years ago for possession of CP.. I am shocked. I can definitely say I dodged a bullet!",1,1767890470.0,bullying,1,0.67,False

As I don’t have a physical shop so a few days ago I tried something different. I used my delivery motorbike as a moving display.

I packed freshly roasted coffee, rode to good walking areas, parked in a good busy neighberhood and simply made myself visible. Although i was fighting the urge to feel shy to feel like I didn’t belong there and feel small. I started inviting people to smell the coffee and taste it. I explained that it was locally roasted and fresh. I live in Tanzania so we have very good coffee...The result surprised me. People were more willing to buy when they could:

see the product

smell it

meet the person behind it

The moment I stopped hiding behind my fear and started sharing the product with confidence, conversations started.

I learned that people don’t just buy products they also buy presence. They buy the courage it takes to stand there with something you created and say “This is mine.” Online is powerful but trust builds faster face to face. Especially when you’re early unknown and selling something sensory like coffee.

1q7gjzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1q7gjzn/how_to_watch_liverpool_games_abroad/,How to Watch Liverpool Games Abroad,"Ever tried to watch a crucial Liverpool match while traveling, only to hit a geo-block screen? You're not alone. Broadcasting rights carve up football coverage into territorial licenses, meaning the service you pay for at home won't work the moment you cross a border—or even sometimes within your own country.

I've spent years testing streaming setups for Premier League matches, and watching Liverpool abroad doesn't have to be complicated. The solution? A VPN combined with the right streaming service.

>✅ **Quick Answer:** Use a reliable VPN like NordVPN to change your virtual location, then access streaming services that show Liverpool matches. Connect to a server in the UK for Sky Sports/TNT, the US for Peacock, or Canada for FuboTV. All 380 Premier League games stream somewhere—you just need to be in the ""right"" place digitally.

# Why Can't I Watch Liverpool Games Abroad?

The Premier League sells broadcast rights country-by-country. Sky Sports might show a match in the UK, but that same license doesn't extend to Spain, Australia, or anywhere else. When you try accessing Sky from abroad, their system checks your IP address, sees you're outside the UK, and blocks you.

Here's what's particularly annoying: you might be a paying Sky Sports subscriber, but the moment you're on holiday in Portugal, your subscription becomes useless. This isn't Sky being difficult—it's the licensing agreements forcing their hand.

The UK also enforces the infamous **3 PM Saturday blackout**. No broadcaster can show matches kicking off at that time, supposedly to protect stadium attendance. So even if you're paying for every subscription available, you'll miss 100+ Liverpool fixtures per season if you rely solely on UK services.

🔒 **Privacy Note:** Broadcasters detect your location through your IP address. A VPN masks this by routing your connection through a server in another country, making it appear you're accessing from that location instead.

# Best Way to Watch Liverpool Abroad: Use a VPN

A VPN is the most reliable method for accessing Liverpool streams while traveling or living overseas. It's legal in most countries (check local laws), and millions of football fans rely on them daily.

# How It Works

1. **Your normal connection:** Your device → Your ISP → Blocked streaming site ❌
2. **With a VPN:** Your device → VPN server (UK/US/etc.) → Streaming site ✅

The streaming service sees the VPN server's IP address instead of yours. If you connect through a UK server, Sky Sports thinks you're in London—even if you're actually in Bangkok.

# Step-by-Step: Watch Liverpool With a VPN

**Step 1: Choose a reliable VPN**

Don't use free VPNs. They're slow, unreliable, and often sell your browsing data. After testing 20+ services, I recommend NordVPN for sports streaming—consistent speeds, works with all major platforms, and actually unblocks geo-restrictions reliably.

**Step 2: Install the VPN app**

Download the app for your device (works on phones, tablets, computers, smart TVs). Installation takes about 2 minutes. You don't need to be tech-savvy—the apps are dead simple.

**Step 3: Connect to a server**

Open the app and select a country where the streaming service operates:

* UK servers for Sky Sports, TNT Sports, BBC iPlayer
* US servers for Peacock, NBC Sports
* Canadian servers for FuboTV
* Indian servers for Disney+ Hotstar

**Step 4: Access the streaming service**

Open your streaming platform. If you already have an account, log in normally. If not, you'll need to sign up (more on that below).

**Step 5: Start watching**

That's it. Liverpool vs. whoever, live, in HD, from anywhere on the planet.

💡 **Pro Tip:** If the stream still won't load, clear your browser cookies first. Sometimes old location data gets cached and gives away your real position.

# Where to Stream Liverpool Games by Region

Liverpool compete in the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, and EFL Cup. Each competition has different broadcasters depending on where you are. Here's the breakdown:

# Streaming Services by Country

|Country/Region|Service|Cost (Monthly)|Games Covered|VPN Server Needed|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**UK**|Sky Sports + TNT|£52.99|267/380 EPL|UK|
|**USA**|Peacock|$10.99|175/380 EPL|USA|
|**Canada**|FuboTV|CA$24.50|All 380 EPL|Canada|
|**Australia**|Optus Sport|AUD$27.99|All 380 EPL|Australia|
|**India**|Disney+ Hotstar|$3.39|All 380 EPL|India 🏆|
|**Ukraine**|Setanta Sports|$2.63|All 380 EPL|Ukraine 🏆|
|**Middle East**|beIN Sports|$10-20|All 380 EPL + UCL|UAE/Qatar/Saudi|

🎯 **Bottom Line:** If you want the absolute cheapest option and don't mind non-English commentary, Ukraine's Setanta Sports at $2.63/month is unbeatable. For English coverage at a great price, Peacock in the US ($10.99) is your best bet.

# UK Options: Sky Sports and TNT Sports

Sky Sports holds 215 Premier League matches per season, while TNT Sports (formerly BT Sport) shows 52 games—primarily Saturday lunchtime kick-offs. Amazon Prime dropped out of EPL broadcasting entirely from the 2025-26 season.

**The problem?** Cost. You'd need:

* Sky Sports subscription: \~£22/month
* TNT Sports via Discovery+: \~£30.99/month

That's over £50 monthly, and you *still* won't get every Liverpool match because of the 3 PM blackout.

**What actually works:** If you're abroad and already have these subscriptions, a UK VPN server unblocks them immediately. If you're starting from scratch, honestly, look at international options—better value and often more games.

# US Options: Peacock and NBC Sports

NBC holds exclusive US rights through 2028. About 175 of the 380 Premier League games stream exclusively on Peacock Premium ($10.99/month). The rest air on NBC or USA Network, which you'd need through a cable provider or live TV streaming service (Hulu + Live TV, YouTube TV, etc.).

Peacock gives you:

* Live streams of exclusive matches
* Same-day replays of all games
* Full match replays available for 30 days
* English commentary from familiar voices like Peter Drury

I've tested Peacock with multiple VPNs—NordVPN and Surfshark both work flawlessly. Just connect to a US server, create an account with a US ZIP code (pick any—90210 works fine), and stream.

⚠️ **Payment heads-up:** Peacock wants a US payment method. Use a virtual card service or PayPal if your regular card gets rejected.

# Budget Champions: India and Ukraine

**Disney+ Hotstar India: $3.39/month** Shows all 380 Premier League matches with English commentary. The quality is solid (1080p), and the platform is surprisingly reliable. I was skeptical at first—how could it be this cheap?—but after testing it for an entire season, it's legit.

Connect to an Indian VPN server, sign up with an Indian mobile number (there are workaround services for this), and you're watching Liverpool for less than a coffee costs.

**Setanta Sports Ukraine: $2.63/month** Even cheaper. All 380 games, decent stream quality, but commentary is usually in Ukrainian or Russian—no English option. If you don't mind reading live text updates while watching the video, this is the most cost-effective streaming solution on the planet.

# Best VPNs for Streaming Liverpool Games

Not all VPNs unblock streaming platforms effectively. After extensive testing, these three consistently deliver for Premier League streaming:

# 1. NordVPN – Best Overall for Liverpool Fans

**Price:** $3.99/month (2-year plan)  
**Servers:** 8,800+ in 129 countries  
**Speed:** Excellent (NordLynx protocol)

NordVPN is my top pick for watching Liverpool abroad. The speeds are fast enough for 4K streaming, and it unblocks every major platform I've tested: Sky Sports, Peacock, FuboTV, Optus Sport, and Disney+ Hotstar.

What makes it stand out? The **NordLynx protocol**—their implementation of WireGuard with extra privacy features. In my speed tests, I maintained 93% of my base internet speed when connected to US servers from Europe. That's virtually unnoticeable for streaming.

It also has **dedicated streaming servers** that are optimized for platforms like Peacock and Disney+. Just select ""Streaming Servers"" in the app, pick your service, and connect. No trial and error.

✅ **Pros:**

* Consistent at unblocking sports platforms
* 10 simultaneous device connections
* 30-day money-back guarantee
* Works on smart TVs, Fire Sticks, gaming consoles

❌ **Cons:**

* Monthly pricing is expensive (get the 2-year plan)
* Occasional server drops (rare, but it happens)

# 2. Surfshark – Best Budget VPN

**Price:** $2.19/month (2-year plan)  
**Servers:** 4,500+ in 100 countries  
**Speed:** Very good

Surfshark offers unlimited simultaneous connections—meaning you can protect every device in your household with one subscription. For families or anyone with multiple devices, that's huge.

I've used it to stream Premier League matches on Peacock, FuboTV, and Sky Sports with no issues. The speeds are slightly slower than NordVPN but still more than adequate for 1080p streaming.

✅ **Pros:**

* Unlimited devices on one account
* Cheapest premium VPN option
* User-friendly apps across all platforms
* Reliable for most streaming services

❌ **Cons:**

* Smaller server network than NordVPN
* Sometimes takes 2-3 server tries to unblock stubborn platforms

# 3. CyberGhost – Best for Beginners

**Price:** $2.19/month (2-year plan)  
**Servers:** 11,500+ in 100 countries  
**Speed:** Good

CyberGhost wins for simplicity. The app literally has a ""For Streaming"" section where you select the service you want to unblock (e.g., ""Peacock TV""), and it connects you to the optimal server automatically.

It's not the fastest VPN I've tested, but it's reliable. I've used it for an entire season of Liverpool matches without major hiccups. The 45-day money-back guarantee is also the longest in the industry.

✅ **Pros:**

* Massive server network
* Dedicated streaming servers with one-click connection
* 45-day money-back guarantee (vs. 30 for most)
* Great for VPN newcomers

❌ **Cons:**

* Speeds can dip during peak hours
* Monthly plan is overpriced—only get the long-term deals

# Streaming Champions League and Cup Matches

Liverpool's Champions League fixtures have different broadcasters than Premier League games:

**Champions League:**

* **UK:** TNT Sports (via Discovery+)
* **USA:** Paramount+ ($7.99/month)
* **Middle East:** beIN Sports
* **Italy:** Sky Italia

**FA Cup:**

* **UK:** BBC iPlayer (free), ITV (free)
* **USA:** ESPN+ (included with Hulu + Live TV)

**EFL Cup:**

* **UK:** Sky Sports
* **USA:** Paramount+

💡 **Pro Tip:** BBC iPlayer is free but geo-restricted to the UK. Use a UK VPN server, create a free BBC account with a UK postcode (any valid postcode works—try ""SW1A 1AA"" for Buckingham Palace), and stream FA Cup matches and Match of the Day highlights at no cost.

# Common Issues and How to Fix Them

# ""This content isn't available in your region""

**Fix:** Your VPN isn't working properly. Try:

1. Clear your browser cookies and cache
2. Disconnect and reconnect to a different server in the same country
3. Use an incognito/private browsing window
4. Switch from browser to the streaming app (or vice versa)
5. Disable location services on your device

# Buffering or slow streams

**Fix:**

1. Connect to a server geographically closer to you (if possible within the target country)
2. Lower the stream quality to 720p instead of 1080p or 4K
3. Close other apps using bandwidth
4. Switch VPN protocols (try WireGuard if available)

Sometimes server congestion is the issue—especially during big matches. Try connecting 15-20 minutes before kick-off when fewer people are streaming.

# VPN detected / ""Please disable your VPN""

**Fix:** Some platforms actively block known VPN IP addresses. Try:

1. Use obfuscated servers (NordVPN and Surfshark have these)
2. Contact your VPN's support—they often have dedicated servers for specific platforms
3. Switch to a different VPN protocol in your settings

# Payment method rejected

Many streaming services want a payment method from the country you're ""located"" in. Options:

1. Use PayPal (often works internationally)
2. Virtual card services (Privacy.com for US addresses)
3. Gift cards purchased from online marketplaces
4. Some VPNs offer virtual payment solutions

# FAQ

**Is using a VPN to watch Liverpool legal?**

Using a VPN itself is legal in most countries (exceptions: China, Russia, UAE with restrictions). Whether accessing geo-restricted content violates a streaming service's terms of service is a grey area. Realistically, platforms care more about blocking VPNs than punishing individual users. I've never heard of anyone getting banned for this.

**Can I watch all 380 Premier League games?**

Yes, if you use the right streaming service. FuboTV (Canada), Optus Sport (Australia), Disney+ Hotstar (India), and Setanta Sports (Ukraine) all show every single match. In the UK or US, you'll need multiple subscriptions to get complete coverage.

**What's the cheapest way to watch Liverpool games?**

Setanta Sports Ukraine at $2.63/month shows all 380 Premier League matches. For English commentary, Peacock ($10.99/month) or Disney+ Hotstar India ($3.39/month) are your best bets.

**Do I need separate VPNs for different services?**

No. One VPN subscription works for all streaming platforms—you just connect to different country servers depending on which service you're accessing.

**Will my VPN slow down my internet?**

Yes, slightly. Encryption adds overhead. Good VPNs like NordVPN only reduce speeds by 5-15%, which is unnoticeable for streaming. Cheap or free VPNs can halve your speeds.

**Can I use a free VPN?**

I strongly recommend against it. Free VPNs are usually slow, unreliable, rarely unblock streaming services, and many log your activity or inject ads. The ""free"" part comes at the cost of your privacy and streaming quality.

**How do I watch on my smart TV?**

Most VPNs offer apps for smart TVs, Fire TV Sticks, and Apple TV. If yours doesn't, you can:

1. Install the VPN on your router (covers all devices on your network)
2. Use screen mirroring from a VPN-connected laptop or phone
3. Use an HDMI cable from a VPN-connected computer

**What if Liverpool are playing on a random Thursday for Europa League?**

Different competition, different broadcaster. Europa League typically streams on:

* **UK:** TNT Sports
* **USA:** Paramount+
* **Other regions:** Check your local listings, then VPN to a country showing it

# Bottom Line

Watching Liverpool abroad doesn't require jumping through impossible hoops. Get a reliable VPN (NordVPN is my go-to), connect to a server in the right country, and access your streaming service of choice. Whether you're traveling for work, living overseas, or just want to bypass the 3 PM blackout, this setup works.

The global nature of football broadcasting is frustrating—paying for multiple subscriptions or missing matches because of arbitrary geo-restrictions is ridiculous. But with the right tools, geography stops being an obstacle.

For Liverpool fans, every match matters. You shouldn't miss Anfield magic just because you're physically somewhere else.",1,1767890232.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False

Hi, I don't know  how to approach the subject so that it doesn't sound like a rant,  I have been in a steady relationship for the past 4 years, my boyfriend and I dated for about 15 months then decided to move in together, its been wonderful, recently we got engaged and now  are planing the wedding, we are both very exited about it,  he is a great person , basically what you'd call a good guy, very bright, super funny, has a good job, has always been  caring and loyal, kind of a dork and a nerd in somethings which I love, I would say without a doubt that hes the best guy I've ever been with, I love him and he loves me very much, my family and friends adore him , so far so good right?, enter best friend sandy , this girl is a total nightmare they have been best friends like forever , and  once I met her a few years back I knew she was bad news, she is very attractive and knows it, always dresses kind of slutty , is a tease and a flirt , if you know the type you can picture her, she has never been rude to me or anything like that, we just keep our distance, we are polite around each other and that's about it, shes not the idiot  people think she is,  she has two kids and recently got divorced, she has always been in his life, and I cant seem to understand why.


 I'm not naive, or narrow minded ,  I have male friends , and I'm the kind of person that believes that a man and a woman can be great friends without sex being involved,  however the  relationship they have is just to much, too close for comfort  and everyone seems to think so,  and it  has been going on like forever, there are so many things ! I don't know were to begin without sounding like a crazy jealous person, the only thing that puts  my mind at ease is the fact that she lives a thousand miles away,  in south Florida.


 She is always texting him , I've checked his phone a couple of times (he doesn't mind, we are very open with each other and I know I shouldn't but still...) she is constantly telling him she misses him, that they should see each other more often, that when is he coming home, that she wants to come up to see him, that a song reminded her of him, all sorts of stupid things, pictures, selfies etc...some times its like a couple of 15 year old kids and I don't make a fuss about it,  the one thing  that really freaks me out is when she tells him she loves him, love is a very strong emotion for me, and he says he loves her back, I don't like that part at all, and the fact that shes drunk dialed him a couple of times at very odd hours even when she was married makes me so mad,  we've had a couple of strong disagreements about that over the years.


I have met his family they are very nice folks and they like me,his sister and I get along pretty good,  we have a lot in common and we've become good friends even with the distance. The first time I met her she found out that best friend sandy was coming to town, and didn't look happy , a couple of years later after we knew each other better I asked her why she didn't  like her,  she told me that she never did , even when they were kids she didn't like her, that she was always trouble and did crazy things, that no one in her family liked her but since she had always been there,  they kind of just tolerated her and accepted her in the household , she shared with me that while they were pre teens, she would always be at their house hanging out, and that she would stay at night and sneak in to my fiance room , apparently their parents didn't know or didn't care, in high school she was always kind of a bitch while my fiance was kind of a nerd, and that she never understood how they remained friends, they didn't even hang around the same group of people, his first girlfriend always felt threaten by her and she wouldn't be last one to feel that way,  I knew all this because of what my fiance sister observed and told me , shes a couple of years older than him,  I talked to him about it and he said it was true, no problem there. I have asked him a couple of times straight up if they ever had some kind of physical relationship in the past, but he has always denied it, he says they are only friends, when she was married my fiance was the best man at her wedding, at her insistence,  her now ex husband and kids would spend time together with us, going on holidays or meeting up for  special occasions , and I must admit I got along better with her husband then with her, he was about 10 years our senior and  always seem oblivious about their weird relationship or just didn't mind, my fiance is  god parent to her youngest kid, they both call him uncle, he adores them and they adore him back, hes great with them and with his nephews, hes wonderful with kids and I cant complain about it.


 A couple of times best friend sandy's dad or other family members have been in town and they call him and have lunch together or just meet up, I can tell they're very found of  him  and care a lot for my fiance, last year he flew down to Florida so that they could go to some convention because she got tickets that were hard to get,  a couple of months ago I went with him to his parents house , she showed up unannounced  and they got drunk in his parents living room watching stupid movies while I was sleeping. We got in huge fight because of it. His sister told me that they used to do that kind of stuff all the time and it just made me angrier. We all ended up having Christmas supper a couple of nights later with her and her kids in my future in-laws house, it was not a happy moment.  He doesn't even drink, just a beer every once and a while and wine with a good meal, this girl just brings the worst of him.


I have met his friends and people close to him, one of his best male friend lives in a neighboring town with his wife , they all went to Florida State together and the 3 of them at one time shared an apartment, they are our closest friends, his wife has always told me that she cant stand best friend sandy and straight out calls her a whore,  so to the point, now that you have an idea with what I've been dealing with.

 
A couple of nights ago we were at our place with some other friends celebrating our recent engagement and setting the date,  she told me that there was something I should know, it was about best friend sandy, like I said  I knew she didn't like her one bit so I didn't think much of it at first , she told me she  hated the fact that even though she didn't attend Florida State with them she still managed to show up all the time, she would stay weeks at a time in my fiance room, and that she ruined a couple of relationships for him , going so far as to punching one of my fiance ex because she had cheated on him,  The story was that they had plans to go  for spring break and since my fiance was single  at the time  he took best friend sandy, I told her I knew all this, now the part that I didn't know but she felt I should, was that they had been drinking all week (no surprises there)  one morning she walked in to their room and they were both naked with another couple in there as well, I asked her naked like with underwear or with something covering themselves and she said no! completely naked!, she didn't see them having sex but 2 girls and 2 guys naked in a room makes you think, what the hell was going on?, all this was before I met him and I know everyone has a past but that really shook me , every time I  hear one of those stories it gets to me , this one was over the top, have I been blind all these years? , I've been honest about my feelings and confronted him about other things but not about this, he usually just laughs and brushes it off saying that it was nothing, and keeps on  insisting  that they have only been friends, very good friends  and that nothing has been going on or ever will.

 
I have an older sister and we are very close , I have told her about all this and we both agree that their relationship is too weird, it seems  very unlikely  for them not to have ever hooked up or been intimate, and now with this new information I have more doubts. 


We are making plans for our wedding,to make things worse and I laugh and smile so I wont cry,  best friend sandy is going to be the best-man, and already shes talking about planing his bachelor party and even a trip to Vegas.

tl;dr: Now here is what's driving me crazy, he has never lied to me, and I feel he has nothing to hide , he has always been honest, when I question him about anything,  is he lying about this? Just so I wont get paranoid all the time, my sister says that I should make him stop being friends with her after we get married,  but on the other hand I know him and I know shes important for him in his life, he has told me on numerous occasions that he's never wanted a relationship  with her other than friendship, and that he wants to spend his life with me, am  I being crazy , paranoid ,jealous and insecure? Is it possible for two people to have that kind of weird friendship? Or am I right to feel that way? What should I do?


[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/accK74NSbR)  **June 6 2015 (1 month later)**

Hi, thank you all for your comments and advice, some of them were really helpful.

I just wish I would have paid more attention to them instead of blindly rushing into things.


I confronted my fiancee . Calmly, one night while we were out for dinner. I told him I didn't want Sandy to be the best man at our wedding. I didn't want her to plan his bachelor party and most important. I didn't want her in our life anymore, of course that he could still keep in touch with his god son, but to limit all contact to that.


It didn't go well. At first he thought I was joking. When I told him I wasn't , he said he couldn't believe it. He told me that he had always been truthful and honest with me from day one and that he never lied about their friendship, try to hide it or downplay it. That he couldn't understand after all this time why I was bring it out now.
We argued some more.  It didn't get heated, just an argument. We left it like that. Agreeing to nothing.



The next day I asked him what  he thought about the conversation we had the night before.
He said I was overreacting, that he couldn't understand why I was being so obtuse about it.
I told him things were going to change that we were getting married.
He told me things shouldn't change!. Especially since we had been living together for some years and happily he added.


It kept on going back and forth for a while. He basically dismissed it and said I wasn't thinking straight. He jokenly called me a  “bridezilla”. That really made me mad.


A couple of days later, I gave him an ultimatum. I told him I didn't want sandy as the best man and I didn't want her in our life's anymore.


My now exfiancee has always been a calm person I on the other hand have been more emotional and impulsive.
He told me to think  about what I was asking him. She wasn't part of our life, she was part of his life and that indeed sometimes lines had been crossed . 
Even thou he didn't see it that way, he respected my point of view.
 However he was willing to make some changes, no bachelor party and would try to ease down on  the contact. 

But that was it. That he wasn't changing her as best man, she was his best friend, had always been and that nothing I or anyone could say or do would change that fact.  

He said that I knew him and that he wasn't a kid who reacted the way I did. He pointed out that I knew He was a reasonable and understanding guy ...but that it was unfair to put him this situation. He said that I was emotional and to reconsider, and give it a couple of days to cool off.
 

I yelled at him and told him to choose.


He didn't say anything.

He slept on the couch.

We didn't speak for about two days.

It was the weekend and he told me he wanted to talk to me, I agreed.

He asked me what my thoughts were.

 I told him I hadn't changed my mind.

He asked me if I was 100% sure about it.

I said I was. That my mind was set , no Sandy bestman, no bachelor party organized be her and no contact.

He just said, ok. THEN ITS OVER, call the wedding off.


I almost had a heart-attack, I was furious and heartbroken. I got very agitated. I told him I couldn't believe he picked her over me.


He said he didn't , that he had picked himself, that if I couldn't accept him the way he was, as I had always done in the past, and couldn't trust or believe him. It was over. 
That he had always trusted me and that if I couldn't do the same it wasn't worth the trouble.


I yelled at him some more and told him I knew about the time they went on spring break together.

He told me they had vacation tons of times together, as a matter of fact still did, that I KNEW ALL THIS!.


I asked him “well what about the time you were naked together in a room with another couple”

He told me all I had to do was ask him and not create this drama.


This made me madder.


He told me he had always been honest with me, and still was, that he didn't have anything to hide. That it was probably xxxxx who had told me.

I said it was.


We calmed down a little , he asked me if I wanted to know.

I told him I did


He said it was true, that they had been indeed naked together in the room, when xxxxx walked in.

 They had met a slightly older married couple on the first day there, after some drinks , some partying and  spending time together. They suggested  a swap , exchange couples. They were attractive, and he said sparks were flaring , also that it was during a time when they were both single, young and wanted to experiment. So they had sex in the same room.


I told him so you had an orgy!!.


He said no!, that it wasn't an orgy,  He had sex with the girl and sandy with the guy. But that him and sandy never had sex.


I told him “so you expect me to believe you were naked with her in the same room, in the same bed while she had sex with this strange guy and you had with his wife and you two didn't do it.”


He said EXACTLY .


I told him I didn't believe him.


He said that was on me, it was the truth, he had no reason to lie about it. He had never lied to me before and wasn't about too. And also that this had happened over 10 years ago, before I met him, and that what ever had happened it didn't matter because it was the past.


I told him I wanted him out.
He said he would leave the next day.


Before he left he told me he loved me and that I was wrong and making a mistake. He told me that I knew him and that if he walked out the door I would never see him again.


I wished him well and that I wasn't changing my mind that he had chosen her and that he was a liar.


He told me to keep everything and that he would come when I was at work for his things.

I haven't seen him since.


Those first days were bad, I felt terrible, I spoke with my sister and she said I had screwed up, big time.  (now she tells me).


I was still angry and felt righteous . I am pretty stubborn.
I sent Sandy terrible text messages, telling her she was a whore , and that I hoped she was happy for ruining my life. She never replied. Not one of my proudest moments.

 
He came back while I was at work and picked up his things, his clothing , books , toys and stuff, he left everything else, even some stuff I had given him as gifts over the years. He left the key.


I lost it, I couldn't believe he would go through with it and just end it all. We are adults for gods sake.


I called him, texted him, emailed him, got no answer. 
I called his work and they told me he was unavailable , I called his sister who I considered my friend and she said she didn't want to get involved.


I haven't stopped crying, I went to my sisters and told her everything.

Now shes claiming that I overreacted, that I took something small and blew it out of proportions, that he was a good guy and that I shouldn't have put him in that position. I told her she was the one who advised me to give him an ultimatum!!. Now she claims I misunderstood her. Gee thank you sis.


My mom is also aware, she agreed with my sister and told me I had screwed up, however that it was my decision and they both supported me. 


My sister said I would never find a guy like him. I was so angry at her, mostly because she is right.


I have had time to think about all this and I have been hurting bad. I think maybe I  made a mistake, I think I acted impulsively and irrational.
I hate to admit it, but I was jealous , envious and insecure of what they had.
Some things are true. 


Like one of the reply here said : They have had all their lives to be together, why haven't they?, if Sandy really wanted to ruin our relationship she could of done it a long time ago. This is on me.



And also like one of the other persons who kindly commented said, (after re reading it and paying attention). She was never rude to me or disrespectful, she kept her distance and never invaded my space. She had done nothing. 


The only time she was not polite was once when her kids were misbehaving and I yelled at her for it, She got mad and said they were children after all. I think I was a bitch about it and deserved it. I never apologized about it. 


Also I was too judgmental , and let myself be influenced about what other people said about her.


The naked thing even though it sounds improbable might be true, he had never lied to me.
On numerous occasions in all these years he answered my questions, even if they were stupid and petty. 
I just couldn't let it go.


My sister points out, he could just not have told me . Pretend it never happened or simply deny it. Saying  it was all a lie or a misunderstanding. I would never have to know,  he chose to tell it to me. Every time.



He was the best guy I have ever been with in my life, no doubt there. He always treated me right, was a real gentleman, never disrespected me in any way, never raised his voice, did small stupid things like open doors for me, pick me up at work, even when I didn't need it. He is smart and hard working. He wasn't wealthy but he took care of all the bills, at first we shared rent, latter he took care of that on his own ,without me asking, always said I should save up my wagers or spend it on myself. He was attentive and tolerant towards me even when I had one of my fits, I admit some times in the past I acted like a  spoiled brat, he was the first person to never say it out loud or point it out to me.


My life has gone to hell, and I cant help to think that it was my fault, like my sister said, I made my bed, now I have to sleep in it.



**tl;dr**:  there is none, I have kept on trying to get in touch with him, with no luck. I am now sitting at my place alone, witch I'm pretty sure I wont be able to afford anymore, On a Friday night, on reddit. fml. anything you say is welcome, thank you. 


[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/IuaLtebutv)  **Dec 29, 2015 (6 months after last update)**

A lot of you wrote me for a update, here it is.

Finally I learned.

But before I think I made things worse.

After the second post, I was pretty upset, almost everyone was blaming me, and practically jumping up and down because I had put my fiance in that position, why is it so easy to judge when I am being honest and truthful?.

I went to my ex work, just to talk to him, he wasn't answering my calls or texts, and had changed his number, I wanted to explain to him that I was wrong and that I had made a mistake, also to give him some of the toys he had left behind, they were in a box and I'm pretty sure he didn't see them when he moved out.

Mostly it was just to apologize, after all was it to much to ask? We had shared our life for four wonderful years.

I didn't go in or anything like that.

Or did I want cause a scene.

I waited for him outside so we could talk.

My sister came along with me for support. I had thought about maybe finding out were he was living, I knew he had moved closer to his job, sis thought that was a better idea than showing up at his work unannounced , but I thought about it and decided it was way to creepy.

It didn't go well.

The moment he saw me he walked away fast, almost running, he didn't even pretend not to see me, he just ignored me and walked in the other direction . I didn't chase him or anything.

I just sat down at a coffee shop and cried. Why was he acting that way and completely ignoring me? .I left him a note on his car. A NICE note apologizing.

I followed some of the advice I read on reddit.

People seem to discard at once the advice on the internet. I am thankful, the persons who know me personally aren't so impartial, or clear headed as some of you.

Thank you all, for putting things in perspective, some of you can see things from my point of view and understand me and not call me a wakko for wanting a better life and a good marriage.

I have now accepted the fact that we will most certainly not get back together.

The first thing I did was apologize to Sandy I sent her a very true and heartfelt message, explaining that I was emotional, and had unjustly discarded my anger towards her. I never received a reply.

I also apologized to his sister, she didn't reply either, that hurt me because I thought we got along and considered her my friend, she just stopped answering my calls.

All the people we had in common , whom I thought were my friends are simply ignoring me and cut me out, except for xxxxx she seems to be a real friend she is very understanding and supportive, her husband on the other hand is giving her a very hard time about the whole situation, and are having a lot of martial trouble because of it, almost to the point that he has practically forbidden her to contact me.

That was about 3 months ago, every once in a while I would send my fiancee a text or maybe an email to see how he was doing, he never responded, he even blocked me from social media, mostly all of our acquaintance did the same, he didn't even contact me on my birthday when in the past he gave me a great gift and flowers.

About two weeks ago I got a phone call, it was Sandy, I was shocked that she had called me, she said she was in town and wanted to meet, I had my suspicions that she would be in town because of that stupid star wars movie, I knew they would see it together.

My sister, who I'm staying with wanted to come along, I told her no.

I had to give up my old place, because I cant afford it. I know some of you will laugh and I deserve it. I was clueless as to how hard it was, and how expensive life is when you are on your own, I had to cut down on almost all the things I used to do.

We met at a coffee shop

She said I knew that I wasn't her favorite person at the moment. The feeling was mutual.

She started by telling me that this whole deal needed some closure

She said he didn't know she had contacted me.

She told me, I had made a mistake, that we are all human and that all of us make mistakes.

She told me that my ex fiancee was hurting bad, was upset and very concerned, that it had been many months and that I hadn't stopped harassing him.

I almost interrupted her at this, but let her finish.

She said she cared about him, as a matter of fact she stated that she cared about him so much, that she had swallowed her pride and came to talk to me. I thought that was very noble on her part and told her so.

She said I had to stop trying to contact him, that it was NOT COOL, and that it had to end, ALL OF IT. The text messages, the emails, the phone calls, not only to him, but also to his sister, to his friends and to HER, that she knew my sister was the one who sent her messages, but that she was going to let that one slide. (I knew about it and did nothing, it was all on my sister) also that I had crossed a line when I called his parents (this was very innocent on my part, there was really no bad intention , once I had called them, ONCE! to see how they were doing. I could simply not write this part down and share it ,but I decided to be honest).

I asked her if maybe she would talk to him and explain that it was my bad to put him in that position and that I just wanted to apologize, that if she really was his friend and wanted what was best for him that maybe she could suggest that with some therapy we could work things out.

She stared at me blankly and stayed quiet for a couple of seconds. She said, she was going to be blunt.

She asked me if I was clear what was going on? (sounding very condescending btw) , she didn't give me a chance to answer she just kept going.

THERE IS NO COUPLES THERAPY , she said very loudly, practically yelling at me, and hitting the table, everyone looked at us in the coffee shop.

I'm quoting her : “I'm here because you have to stop what you are doing, all of it! , he is going to get a restraining order against you.”

She said that if I hadn't taken the clue that he didn't want to talk to me or have anything to do with me, that he had changed his phone number TWICE and that she had done the same, she asked me if I thought that was the way a normal person reacted?

That really got me, it was not very honorable or decent on his behave to do that, it made me so angry. What exactly had I done? What?, just because he was rude and didn't reply my messages, like any sane adult would!.

I wasn't chasing him, around , slashing his tires or doing all those weird things a crazy person would do to merit a restraining order. Not a good call on his part and I will never forgive him for that, my heart shrunk a little.

I calmed down again and told her that I was not a crazy stalker, I told her that it was going to far on his part, reality check: a restraining order? please?

Again she stared blankly at me. It was infuriating but I kept my composure.

OK, WHATEVER ! , she said. That this was a courtesy call. She said she didn't owe me anything, but that really, REALLY, I had to cut it out, and had to stop before things to got out of hand.

We sat in silence finishing our coffee.

I asked her if it was about the work thing? , I explained that I just wanted to apologize and talk to him, and drop off some of things he had left behind, some of his toys I knew they were important to him, and that he overacted. I was calm and didn't want to make scene, she wasn't ! and was obviously emotional .

She said , (loudly I might add) that I had sent him several texts and emails, telling him he was going to be sorry , and that he was going to regret breaking up with me, and leaving me at the altar.

She practically yelled , “WHAT THE HELL'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?”

I think he took it out of context, It was never my intention for that to be taken in a bad way. But I kept my mouth shut. I may have been angry at first when I sent him those stupid messages and not thinking straight, of course I did not mean it in the way she put them, it was an exaggeration and all I said was that he had ALMOST left me at the altar, we were engaged for god sake, it was excessive and way over the top but it was never as bad as she claimed it was. I am not going to lie or sugar coat it. It was an error of judgment. And a huge mistake in my weakest moment.

She said , she was leaving.

Before she left she told me that she had tolerated me all these years despite my childishness and disrespect, because for some strange reason my ex-fiancee had cared about me. That I was a grown woman and that I shouldn't scoop down so low , that she didn't have anything else to say, that please I should listen to her and follow her advice and not contact her ever again, and to tell my crazy sister the same (she used those exact words) , about the toys to throw them away or do what ever I wanted with them.

She left.

Now I can understand her bad attitude and her patronizing demeanor, I deserved it, the text messages I had sent her were very bad, the ones my sister had sent her were worse. I never told my sister to do that, she cares about me and was angry. It was a hurtful thing to do , that , I admit, is on me 100 %.

But to go as far as saying she had tolerated me?. And had disrespected her before I sent the messages? Never.

I was troubled about their weird friendship as so many people pointed it out in the past and I shared that on many occasions with my fiancee , but never acted on it!. I was the one who had to tolerate her.

She was the one who was toxic, like so many people pointed out, I'm not saying I am an innocent bystander , but it all began with her inappropriate behavior with my fiancee.

Again , I think she was exaggerating, overreacting and creating a bigger issue about some small misunderstandings.

I did get the message loud and clear after our meeting.

I should get over it and, start my life again.

That was a real eye opener , I think the thing about the restraining order, if it was ever true, was just over the top. Believe me I have my doubts about it, but still like I said received loud and clear.

I sent one last email to my fiancee thanking him for everything , it wasn't one of my smartest moves, but I had to speak my mind. I told him that now I understood that sandy and him were real friends. (I didn't mention the fact that she had been sneaking around and had spoken to me). And that I wouldn't throw his toys away as I knew they were important to him, and that I would keep them in case he ever wanted them back.

(my sister said we should cut of the heads of the toys and send them by mail, or sell them online, a joke of course. to be clear ). I apologized again for all the other messages , I explained that I was emotional, a normal reaction, after all we had a life together and that I wouldn't be contacting him ever again . No I love you's , no begging him to take me back, I still had some dignity left, no weird things. Just that. Very simple.

Next day to my surprise, best friend sandy called me, she was screaming at me and said she was going to “kick my sorry ass!” if I didn't cut the crap (her words), to consider my self warned. I wish I had somehow recorded her call, it was very intimidating.

Like my sister said : Who's the crazy one now , bitch?, I think that was uncalled for, there was no need for that.

I don't want to validate myself or say I was right all along, but... to threaten me? That's just too much in my book. I always knew she was prone for violence.

First she is very condescending and practically calls me a stalker, and now she is threatening to do physical harm to me? I wasn't going to go to the police or anything like that, I'm going to be a better human being and leave it at that.

Things at work haven't been so good, as you can imagine. Christmas was horrible. I started going to the gym as someone suggested to clear my mind, I convinced my sister to join me, we both need to get out there. I have been thinking about going to therapy. I have been lonely and feeling kind of depressed. These past few weeks have been rough. I will admit, this is not the outcome I expected.

I think I have learned my lesson , a hard one, I'm moving on, and I know better times will come.

Regarding some of the comments. No I am not crazy, No I am not a stalker, No I am not delusional , no I'm not going to kill myself , No I don't live in 17th century England were men and women cant be friends.

Some kind souls out there understand me and share that my demands and ultimatum were extreme but justified.

tl;dr: Bottom line, am I not allowed to have emotions ? Am I not entitled to an opinion different from everyone else. I'm not allowed to think that the relationship they had over all those years was way over the top?, So I am immature and behave like a child because I think different. I'm the bitch of all this because I'm not comfortable about my future husband and his wild female friend being way to close? And speaking my mind about it? I had the best intentions and that if it was going to end, was it too much for it to end in good terms ? The least he could of done was acknowledge me and give me five minutes to apologize, That is what a real decent man would have done. That is all on him.
