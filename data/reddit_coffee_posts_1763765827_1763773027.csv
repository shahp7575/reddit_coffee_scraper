Posting here hoping to meet someone I can talk to consistently. Yung tipong daily kwentuhan, random updates, sending memes, kamustahan, and all that warm, steady energy. I want someone I can go on cute dates with, roadtrips, and occasionally cuddle with (only if we’re both comfortable, of course).

Hindi ako nagmamadali pumasok sa serious relationship but I’m also not closing my doors. Honestly, the idea of building a real connection first, one that feels natural, steady, and mutual, sounds really nice.

I've met her in 11th grade and there are alot of things about her that I liked back then and I still like now. 
Firstly she is very intelligent, and also very determined. Also I find her very funny and profoundly beautiful.

I never talked to her back then because to me it seemed like she disliked me for some time, which funnily enough was kind of true. 
She got into a relationship, that ended 6 months ago. 
She and I started talking more.
(we're not in school anymore) We talked about everything. Sports, the past, but also very intimate subjects. And also the way we saw each other in school, and we came to the conclusion that both of us think that in some ways we are kind of similar to each other.
She told me that she liked me back then and found me attractive and I did(and do) like her too.

Some time passed and 2 weeks ago we went to go grab coffee. It wasn't a date, but it was very nice and we talked alot. When I brought her back home we sat in my car and talked alot. We were right outside her house and just sat in my car and talked. 

We talked about love, relationships. And for example she said that i gotta find her a boyfriend in my team(sports) and we laughed. Then she said, for her, Once she likes someone as a friend, that cant change to her liking someone romantically and the other way around. And then she took me as an example, but stopped abruptly and said that it's different with me because she found me attractive(""sexy"" in her words) when we were in school and now shes glad we're friends. 

I like her, I really do. Did she friendzone me? I dont know how to communicate my uncertainty to her without sounding overbearing. 
The reason why this is so important to me is that firstly, she is. And second i feel like I'm falling into old patterns, because I feel the urge to distance myself from her. It's weird, and I don't know how to properly deal with my emotions and this situation. I don't want to make old mistakes again.

I’m living home while i plan my career or next move. My current circumstances make me feel alone, I don’t have friends. I have one person I talk to but we don’t hang out much, siblings in college. So this backstory is important because it’s as though I can’t relate to anyone. I opened up to my grandma or mom but my grandma tells me dating is more important (I never did) and friends will be hard to find and that this friend I’m writing about… I shouldn’t reconnect to. My mom and I don’t really talk so her advice was do what you want.


Had this friend I knew from childhood. We went to high school together. In college we were close and had the same major/ a lot of the same classes (small college) and always were together in and out of school, we had a lot of the same interest and for years things were great. some point she got new friends and I got hurt that the friendship was one sided. We didn’t ever really communicate and I assumed the friendship was dead. It was painful to watch her posts online so I removed her. I thought: why did she not care enough to message me, like I always did for her? For 2 years I figured I’d work on my own self. Not being clingy maybe that was it?


We came back in touch through being at the grad school orientation, we got coffee. It was nice because she was open to meeting again and said she’d love to hang out more, just tell her when. Etc. But I never saw her after... she followed my social for a bit but a while goes by and her social media just disappeared. 

Years later she got engaged and moved. But she’s back now, my mom apparently saw her mom. They kinda talk together. My mom said it won’t hurt to reach out. At one point my mom blurts: you used to be so lively what’s going on? You hardly talk to friends you shut down.


Im just scared trying to resuscitate a friendship when im in a place of not having my own friends and still figuring my career out. Feeling like im so behind/ others are well adjusted… it may not be  especially since people often say don’t go to the past. Did this friend show that she’s indifferent? Not that she hates me ofc but that she doesn’t really mind if I’m there or not.. What do you think? My confidence is shot because im applying to jobs and no luck. This friend lives like very close to my family home btw 


Edit: we stopped speaking in our very early 20s. Got coffee that one time years later. Now we’re both 25. Haven’t spoke to her since that time. Not sure it’s dead",2,1763772312.0,Adulting,1,1.0,False

Hey guys,
I just need to talk to someone who understands this. The past few days have been hell for me and I feel like I’m losing myself.

So here’s what happened…

I’ve had anxiety and panic on and off for about 5 years. I’ve had probably 10+ panic attacks in total. Nothing new. But last Saturday I had a MASSIVE one, like the worst one I ever had.

That morning I did cardio, drank coffee, then smoked a cigarette… and boom. Out of nowhere my whole body freaked out. Heart racing, heavy fear, weird feeling rushing through my chest. It terrified me so much.

Since that day… I haven’t been normal.

What’s going on now:
	•	Random waves of panic during the day
	•	Weird chest sensations (not pain, just this uncomfortable “something”)
	•	Stomach acting up all day
	•	Heartburn that triggers anxiety instantly
	•	Trembling when I wake up
	•	Feeling disconnected from myself
	•	Fear of dying
	•	Over-focusing on my heartbeat
	•	Can’t sleep because I keep listening to my heart
	•	Even laughing hard makes me shake
	•	This constant “something is wrong” feeling

It’s like my body stayed stuck in panic mode since Saturday.
Like my nervous system refused to calm down.

Tests:

All heart tests clean. Blood work clean. Thyroid clean.
I saw 3 heart doctors in the past 2 years all said my heart is perfectly fine.

Meds:

I took 0.5 mg Xanax ,barely did anything.
Today my doctor put me on 40 mg Propranolol.
I took one pill and it helped a bit, but I still feel nervous and “off.”

The part that scares me:

I miss who I was before this.
I feel like everyone else is living normally while I’m stuck in this nightmare.
Every morning I wake up shaking.
I’m scared I’ll stay like this forever.

Also I swear a lot of this comes from my stomach.
Every time my stomach burns or feels weird, I get instant panic.
It feels like the whole thing starts from there.

So I need to ask:
	•	Has anyone had one massive panic attack that messed them up for days after?
	•	Did your nervous system eventually calm down?
	•	Does Propranolol actually help?
	•	Any tips for anxiety that starts from stomach issues?
	•	How do you stop the fear of your own heartbeat?

I’m exhausted and honestly desperate for some reassurance.
I just want to feel like myself again.

Was recently (Tuesday morning) wearing AirPods Pro 3 with ANC enabled while drinking hot coffee. First sip and my left ear and the left side of my throat emitted so much sharp pain and continued to do so with each sip while I drank the whole cup. 

Thought it strange but carried on with my day. The pain wasn’t as sharp or intense after I finished the coffee, but an underlying ache has remained ever since. Jaw, ear, throat. Left side only. Drinking coffee does intensify the pain slightly. The pain hasn’t been as sharp as the first day. 

I take ibuprofen regularly and my doctor has ruled out ear infection and my dentist has ruled out tooth trouble. I’ve been prescribed Carbamazepine but am reluctant to begin treatment as it is a very powerful medication and I am quite sensitive to meds in general.

That one I left behind—along with a perfectly respectable life—when I realized the world only made sense to me in color, shadow, and the wet slap of paint against concrete.

# **Early Disturbances

(Or, Why I Never Became an Accountant)\*\*  
I grew up in a suburb where everything came in beige: the houses, the cars, the ambitions. I tried to fit in—really, I did. But while other kids drew stick figures, I was painting tidal waves that swallowed entire cities. My teachers recommended therapy; I recommended they open their eyes.

At nineteen, after one semester of community college in “Business Communications,” I dropped out. I traded my textbooks for a secondhand duffel filled with smuggled spray cans and pigments I mixed in the bathroom of a 24-hour laundromat. They called me a troublemaker.  
I preferred **artist**.

# Birth of a Ghost

I never meant to become an underground painter. But one night, while tagging an abandoned underpass, an old man startled me. Instead of reporting me, he laughed.

“Kid,” he said, “you paint like a wave that doesn’t ask permission.”

That stuck.  
**Micheal Wave** was born.

I started painting in places where no one was supposed to look, yet everyone eventually did: sewer tunnels, condemned factories, rooftops that trembled in the wind. My murals grew like rumors. No signatures—just a small ripple symbol in the corner.

People whispered:  
*Is he one person or a collective? Does he live? Does he float?*

I didn’t answer.  
Ghosts rarely do.

# The Underground Current

My art spread through the city like a secret map. Street kids used my murals as meeting points; skaters treated them like holy sites; one cult (unofficially, I hope) claimed my ripples predicted the end times. I painted emotions people tried hard to bury:

* The face of a man crying into a cup of gas station coffee
* A door floating in the sky with nothing behind it
* A goldfish bowl smashed open, water suspended midair

People said my art made them feel “uneasy but understood.”  
That’s all I ever wanted.

# When I Nearly Got Caught

There was one night—rain-soaked, of course—when a patrol car cornered me behind an old textile mill. Paint on my hands, mask still on. I should’ve run.

Instead, I stepped into a puddle and saw my reflection—blurred, warped, shifting.  
“That’s me,” I thought.  
A distortion.  
A wave.

The man slipped on the slick ground long enough for me to vanish into the alley’s hum. I don’t know if it was fate, luck, or the universe telling me I wasn’t done yet.

# Why I Keep Painting

I never sought fame. Fame finds you; truth hides. I’ve always been more interested in the hidden. In the tunnels beneath the city, people leave stories—names carved into stone, dates that mattered to no one else. I paint to honor those ghosts.

And maybe, in some submerged part of myself, I paint to find the person I might’ve become if the world had offered me more colors when I was young.

# Where You’ll Find Me

Some nights I’m in an abandoned subway line, painting a horizon that will never see sunlight. Other nights I’m on a rooftop, adding a streak of electric blue to a water tower no one looks at—until they do.

If you see a ripple on a wall where it shouldn’t be, look closer.  
It might be me.  
Or it might be someone else carrying the current forward.

Either way, the wave keeps moving.",1,1763772063.0,TrueMediaPublished,0,1.0,False

I like the idea of a tube amp, and I am not much into petals (for now).  It would used in my house and for gig'ing, small venues like breweries and coffee shops.

Main genres/bands for playing are blues, classic rock, White Stripes, Bealtes, and Led Zeppelin and garage rock.  Blues is my first love for playing.  

Good Cleans and Distortion are a must.

Budget would be Five Hundred to Eight Hundred dollars.

I am not well versed in amps so any knowledge and/or suggestions are greatly appreciated. 

I posted this in r/guitaramps.  And thank you to those who already commented!  ",1,1763771918.0,Guitar,3,1.0,False

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

I started my coffee journey with a Breville Dual Boiler and a Breville Smart Grinder about two years ago. I could never consistently get good shots out of it, probably because I wasn’t paying enough attention to the details. Eventually I found myself reaching for espresso less and less.

When I moved to V60, things changed. I’m using a 1Zpresso K-Ultra paired with a V60 01 ceramic dripper, and the results have been way closer to what I enjoy from specialty cafés. I haven’t experimented much with recipes other than basic 60*5 and Tetsu Kasuya’s 4:6, but I found Tetsu gets the best flavour and taste I want from the coffee. I’m barely touching my espresso machine these days.

What I’m looking for:
I’d love suggestions on what to explore next — whether it’s learning more about extraction, experimenting with different brewing methods/equipment or improving my pour-over technique. What helped you level up your pour-over game?

I also sometimes need to brew for two people (my wife + me). Any recommendations for brewing larger batches comfortably? Should I move to a V60 02, or a switch 03?

Thanks in advance — excited to dive deeper into the pour-over rabbit hole! 🙌",1,1763771641.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I'll spare you most of the sob story, the title kinda covers it, but here's what I will say

I've spent much of my adult life too broke to reciprocate my family's generous and consistent holiday gifts due to several factors ranging from disease to debt. In recent years, I've turned things around and can now afford to get gifts for people this year. I've mostly got things covered, but a few have me stumped (largely because they have most everything they want and need,) and I'm rusty at this. 

I could use some *specific* suggestions for the following, my budget for each being ~$25 but that's not a hard ceiling:

Dad: He loves cooking and food, he's big on fancy or unique marmalades (sweet or savory.) Looking for one of those OR a decent coffee (he likes dark roast) OR suggestions for cozy socks 

Sister: Somewhere I can find a quality candle, preferably known for understated/not overpowering scents. She has two young boys and an incredibly busy life, doesn't get much time with hubby due to different work schedules. Something to make her life easier or help her find a moment of peace/a respite. 

Nephews: one is 5, one is 1.
- 5yo loves construction equipment, helping Mom cook (this kid can actually handle a knife and do prep with semi-proper knife work) crafts, and SUGAR 

- 1yo is... 1 year old. Also, he may or may not secretly be my favorite. 😬 What the hell do I get a one year old?

TL;DR Can finally afford gifts for fam, want suggestions for marmalade, quality candles, and goodies for a 5yo and 1yo

My relationship has been on and off for 3 years. During one of our breaks, a new deputy started working with me. We became friendly as colleagues, but he eventually told me he liked me. I immediately said no and set very firm boundaries which was hard for him to understand. He’s married with a child, and I’ve always been honest with my boyfriend about every detail.

Recently, my manager offered me a company-provided training course. It’s not something everyone gets chosen for, so of course I accepted. Only afterwards did I realise it fell on the same week my boyfriend and I planned to take holidays. Nothing was booked, but he refused to change dates. I couldn’t change the training, so I cancelled the holiday.

He now claims I cancelled because I “wanted to go with my deputy,” which simply isn’t true. I actually asked my boyfriend to come with me since the company would pay for the hotel. I also have severe driving anxiety — long distances, unfamiliar places, and big roundabouts give me panic attacks. On top of that, I share a car with my brother, and he needed it during those days. So I was stressed about even getting there.

The day before the course, I found out my deputy was also attending and would be driving the 2h20m trip. Because of my anxiety and the car situation, I accepted the lift. We travelled together, stayed in separate rooms, and only went for dinner because there was nothing else around and the company covered it. Then we both went straight back to our rooms.

To reassure my boyfriend, I showed him everything:
• Screenshots from the next morning where my deputy texted me asking if I wanted a coffee — which obviously shows we didn’t sleep together.
• All messages between me and my deputy.
• Messages with my friend from during the training where I told her how awkward and uncomfortable I felt because she knows the whole situation.

These two days were extremely stressful for me. I am glad I completed the training, but I honestly couldn’t wait for it to be over.

Despite all of this, my boyfriend is still accusing me of cheating and calling me really nasty names which I’m tired. It’s something he always does. Name calling. I do understand is side but again I kind of had not much choice and would never cheat. If I wanted to cheat with him I could have cheat before. I wouldn’t have to go through all this.
 
This training was important to me. I graduated just over a year ago, and I’ve worked incredibly hard to get where I am — doing countless 24-hour shifts and over 70-hour weeks for nearly three years. I finally secured an amazing job with good pay, and being selected for this course was a big opportunity. Not everyone gets chosen, and it would qualify me to train new staff and deliver yearly refresher training to the whole team. My manager even hinted that he wants to place unit managers on each floor, and it felt like he was preparing me for that role.",1,1763771487.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

I’ve healed from a lot of it, but it still affects my deen. I’ve never smoked, drank, done drugs, or engaged in zina. Unfortunately, I only pray sometimes and attend Jummah. I’ve prayed five times a day before, and I know I can get back to it. I got to know one potential who understood my struggle with salah; just talking to her encouraged me to pray a bit more. If my future wife asked me to pray and lead her in salah, I wouldn’t say no. It might not be all five right away, but I’d start with a few and build up. I know I’d feel more grounded with someone who prays, and I’d be more consistent if she encouraged me.

Most of my friends describe me as genuine and say I’m a solid potential. I really just need an encouraging Muslim environment. I just don’t want my inconsistency with salah to be the reason I struggle to find a wife.

Aside from Muzmatch, Salaams, and InPairs, what other apps or websites do people in the U.S. use to find a Muslim spouse, and what were your experiences?

1p3f36z,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/1p3f36z/prison_made_of_love/,Prison made of love,"Have you ever wondered which pain is harder to bear? Which one cuts deeper? The person trapped behind bars, longing for a freedom he no longer owns— unable to breathe fresh air whenever he desires, unable to stand beneath the rain and let it wash over his skin as if it could cleanse his sins and wipe away everything heavy, unable to call out a beloved name the moment his heart aches for it, unable to hear the birds under an open sky.

His hopes cling to the thin beam of light slipping through a crack, or to those visits that, at least, are no longer in secret.

But what about the one who is free? Who can taste the beauty of the world, feel the changing seasons, invite herself out for coffee when the heart grows heavy, find comfort in music— and yet she is a prisoner of her own emotions?

Have you ever thought about that? How unbearably hard it is when the thought of someone you loved—perhaps still love— follows you everywhere? When every moment holds their shadow?

Sometimes a single piece of music is enough to turn your whole world upside down, because something in its melody, in its words, pulls his memory back to the surface and makes your eyes burn with tears.

Or when, after a long exhausting week, you pour yourself a glass of red wine and suddenly remember your nights of love. Or a street pushes you toward the weight of shared memories. Or even at work, when your mind is fully focused, one accidental glance from a stranger reminds you of the one your heart still chooses.

Rain brings back the rain in his eyes, snow recalls the cold days of separation and the bitterness of his words, or maybe the warmth of his arms instead.

For me, you are as beautiful as the shapes the clouds draw in the sky. Everything in nature turns my heart toward you. My heart remembers everything— and that is its curse.

Sometimes I wish my gaze on you, on us, hadn’t been so deep— because it made me a captive of my own feelings. But seeing deeply into people and moments is part of who I am. Maybe that’s why you thought I was dramatic— because my words came from my heart and my soul. Their power was born from the love I had for you, and perhaps because I am the daughter of a poet. You always forgot that my father wrote poetry.

You live in my thoughts, my dear stranger— and sometimes that is painful, and sometimes it is strangely sweet.

If you ask me which prisoner suffers more, I’d say both. In both their worlds, silence is the loudest song they hear each day. Both fight for a freedom they’ve lost.

But do you know the difference? The one behind bars is paying the price for a sin— maybe he will be forgiven one day and taste freedom again.

But the one imprisoned by her own heart, what was her sin? To love? To entrust her heart to someone who felt like home? That is a cruel punishment— to be trapped inside your own memories while your body walks free.

Whom must she forgive to become childlike again—fearless, unbound?

I never thought my love could suffocate anyone— or even myself.

And now that we’re speaking of prisons, let me tell you this: your silence, your absence, this bitter separation— it all reminds me of a cell.

My best friend, my compatriot in loneliness, just got engaged. To her first boyfriend. They’ve been dating for a year. 

The story is sweet and romantic. The stuff they write novels about. He showed up at her house on a motorcycle to ask her out, after years of crushing on her. Before that he spent an entire year going to her place of work trying to figure out who she was while a mutual friend was trying to get him to hang out with her brother. She turned him down twice before she said yes. She also prayed for clarity and direction shortly before he showed up literally at her front door. 

They hold hands, he picks her up for spontaneous ice cream dates, and cooks her dinner, and builds her a bookshelf, and they go for cute little walks with coffee. 

I’m happy for her, I really am. She is getting everything she ever wanted. 

Another friend is celebrating ten years with her boyfriend. My brother just started dating someone new. Everywhere I look there’s people in love. Old, young, my age. They skip in and out of relationships like flat stones on a lake. A new love interest every couple of months, unless they’ve been together for ages.

It’s not fair. Why not me? What about me excludes me from love?

I saw a video recently that said the way love hangs about feels like a promise. The universe taunts me, but it has never offered me the promise of love. Not a single fucking soul. Ever. Not one. I just want someone to try, even if it doesn’t work out. I just want a little sign that I am worthy of romance. 

And I know I am worthy. And I know that romantic love is not the only love. And it will happen when I least expect it, but I’ve never expected it. There’s more to life than love. I know, but maybe your life can be too full and vibrant.

I don't Know.,"I want to start journaling again, because the truth is that I don’t really know who I am. I realized this a long time ago, but it still lingers. I don’t even know what my favorite food is. Maybe I don’t have one. Maybe I prefer coffee dates or dinner dates over walks. Maybe I love partying.

I often tell people I hate reading, yet I remember the thrill of picking up a book every night before bed. That excitement must mean something. I know I need alone time, but not too much. I wonder if I’d be a good dancer, or if slam poetry is something I’ve truly lost. I say hosting a TV show isn’t for me, but how can I know if I’ve never tried?

I even question relationships. Would I make a terrible girlfriend? I claim I know the answer from my everyday actions, but I don’t know what it feels like to have a million feelings erupt inside me when someone touches me. Would that change me? Would I cheat? Could I give someone the care and attention I insist I can’t?

In the end, what do I really know about myself that others don’t? Why does it all feel staged, like I’m living as an imaginary version of me, still unfinished, still undefined?",1,1763770591.0,ThoughtsYouCanFeel,0,1.0,False

I have a lamp by the bed called ""Bed"" and siri used to play music by a band called Bed when I wanted her to turn the bed on. She doesn't do that anymore and all I have to do is say ""Bed"" and the light goes on or off. I also have a light I call ""Lamp"" and she toggles it just by saying the word.

The problem I have now is I have a new light which I want to call ""Sofa"" or ""Couch,"" but every time I say either of those words, Siri shows me the nearest Crate & Barrel store*. I am trying to come up with names for the lamp that make sense but don't trigger these web searches. Turning off ""Allow Web Content on This Device"" doesn't stop her from doing this, either. She will just say that web content isn't allowed and she gives up. Ideally, I would just say ""Couch"" and the light would toggle, just like it works with my other smart lights. But Siri is being really stubborn about this one lamp.

So what names do you choose for your devices? Or do you just relent and say the entire command (e.g. ""Siri, turn on the couch light"" or similar).


\* As an aside, I'm not really convinced this is useful behavior from Siri.

¤¤¤¤¤



The snow came soft this year.

Not in some dramatic blizzard, not in movie flakes, just a steady sift of white across Mississauga, quiet as breath over a sleeping giant.

The city felt thinner under it, the way a face looks different in candlelight.

Streetlamps wore halos. 

Bare branches carried the memory of leaves. 

The dark arrived early and stayed.

They called it Christmas break.

The sky called it something older.

Kai could feel that old word in his ribs, even if he didn’t know its name.

He zipped his jacket and stepped out onto the walk, breath misting in slow, even clouds.

The snow didn’t melt when it touched him.

It held for a moment longer,
like it remembered his name.

Holiday lights blinked from porches he’d known since childhood. 

Somewhere down the street, someone’s speaker played an out-of-season soca track the snow politely ignored.

Holiday traffic hummed past in tired reds and whites. 

In a nearby window, a plastic reindeer blinked red and green beneath fluorescent kitchen light.

Streetlamps leaned in as he walked beneath them,
flickering once, like eyelids trying to wake.

On his phone, the group chat pinged:

Aspen: you alive or did your aura finally crash the grid

Mike: leave him, I got snacks

Sequoia: I have tea. divination optional 

Kai’s lips bent, not quite to a smile. 

He slid the phone away.

He wasn’t thinking of Christmas.

He was thinking of light, how it thinned and thickened this time of year, how it clung to him a little longer than it should, how streetlamps sometimes brightened when he stepped beneath them and dimmed when he passed.

Coincidence, he told himself.

The rhythm inside him disagreed.

Kai huffed a quiet laugh, tucked his hands into his sleeves, and started walking.

No bus. 

No commute. 

Just ten minutes of snow underfoot and the familiar curve of the street leading him toward the house where the night had already begun.

The closer he got, the warmer the streetlamps glowed, as if recognizing him. 

As if leaning closer.

He turned up the wide drive, lined with boxwoods already powdered in white. 

Sequoia and Aspen’s place wasn’t just a house.

It was an estate.

Three stories of glass and dark wood perched on a slope above the city line, half-hidden behind cedar and private fencing, the kind of modern build that whispered money instead of shouting it.

Inside, floor-to-ceiling windows held back the snowlight. 

Outside, soft lanterns glowed in tall sconces like quiet sentinels.

The house didn’t feel rich. 

It felt consecrated.

The lights steadied. 

The cold eased. 

And Kai stepped into the night that had been waiting for him.


¤¤¤¤¤


Kai


¤¤¤¤¤



Their house smelled like cedar, orange peel, and something floral he could never quite name.

Kai stamped the snow from his boots onto the heated marble foyer, heat blooming up from the floors in small ghosts around his ankles.

Beyond the entrance, the living room glowed. 

Not bright. 
Not harsh. 

Just layered.

Tree lights coiled around a towering spruce, soft yellow threaded through deep green.

Somewhere in his bones, he could feel it, not just the solstice, but something older still.

Fires on frozen fjords.

Bearded men howling into the dark, calling the sun home with mead and blood and bone-deep song.

The Vikings hadn’t waited for light.

They’d demanded it.

And some part of him, deep, northern, unnamed, remembered how to burn that way.

Three white candles in glass jars waited, unlit but ready, on the coffee table carved from reclaimed cypress.

A single strand of fairy lights hung crooked across the curtain rod, like someone started decorating and got distracted by an idea.

Kai felt it again, that thrum beneath Aspen’s skin.

A shared heartbeat, low and ancient, beating too hard for one body.

Something dark lived beneath the surface of his friend’s bright grin.

Not evil - no, something older.

Hungry. 

Coiled.

The kind of hunger that could rewrite nations, or burn through bloodlines just to taste the ash.

For a breath, it looked at him.

Through Aspen’s eyes.

And in that moment, Kai did not flinch.

He only wondered which of them would win, when the veil finally split.

Then, without knowing, without words, he said 

yes.

To the plan already seeded by the Archive, now blooming quietly toward completion.

Aspen was sprawled on the sunken lounge in front of the floating fireplace, toque slightly off-center. 

He texted with one hand, the other shoveling trail mix like it was an Olympic qualifier.

Aspen glanced at Kai and felt it again, that low hum, just beneath the quiet.

Not noise, not heat exactly, but a rhythm, tight and tidal, aching to crest.

He didn’t know what it was.

Only that it was coming.

And some part of him, deep and unspoken, prayed he’d be there to catch it when it did.

Mike sat near the far bookshelf, headphones draped around his neck, a bag of plantain chips open beside him.

Sequoia moved between them like a conductor walking among an orchestra that didn’t yet know it was one. 

Adjusting pillows. 

Repositioning the incense burner. 

Nudging a mug a half-inch left to align with a symmetry only she could see.

“You’re late,” Aspen called, not looking up.

“He’s on Kai time,” Mike replied.

 “Cosmic buffer.”

“I brought food,” Kai said, lifting the insulated bag like an offering.

That ended the argument.

Sequoia accepted it with a nod and the kind of private smile that didn’t need witnesses.

“Kitchen,” she said. 

“Then socks. 

My house rules. 

No frostbite.”

Kai stepped onto the oak inlay and padded toward the kitchen, the air warming by degrees.

The floorboards did not creak when he passed.

As if the house knew its weight was holy.

The kitchen was brighter, cozier, a chef’s dream softened by candles and steam.

A pot on the stove released rich curls of cinnamon and clove.

The counters gleamed, but not sterile, cutting boards bore the memory of oranges sliced and herbs chopped with care. 

Four plates already waited, napkins folded with the kind of tender exactness that comes from feeding people you love.

“You cooked again,” Kai said.

Sequoia shrugged, stirring the pot. 

“It’s just punch.”

He knew the difference between punch and what she made.

He unpacked his bag: roti wrapped in foil, jerk wings from Mike’s uncle’s spot on Lakeshore, and a tin of cookies from his neighbor ""for the nice boy across the street.""

They landed on the island like a spell cast in scent: warmth, spice, sugar, memory.

“It smells like every country in here,” Aspen called from the other room.

“That’s the point,” Sequoia replied, turning down the burner.

“Now sit tight. 
I’m lighting things.”

She said it like a promise, or a threat.

Kai leaned against the marble counter, watching her move.

She lit a small bundle of dried greens over the gas flame and blew it out until it smoked. 

The smell was sharp, resinous, not quite sage, not quite cedar.

Something deeper.

“What’s that?”

“A blend,” she said. 

“My aunt in B.C. makes it. 

“Cedar. Cedar’s cousin, juniper, maybe. 

Or that white bark tree my aunt won’t name but always gathers under the solstice moon. 

Stuff the land remembers better than we do.”

The smoke curled upward like a question answered.

She carried it back into the great room, trailing it like a soft animal.

When Kai followed, the lights warmed.

Sequoia set the smoking bundle in a shallow bowl of black stone near the window, then turned to the tree.

It wasn’t perfect, not pruned to symmetry or showroom sleek.

But it was tall. 

Towering, even.

And it looked alive.

Like someone had listened to it before asking it to hold their light.

She adjusted a branch.

Unhooked a crooked ornament.

Then turned from the tree to the coffee table, reaching for the lighter.

“The power grid’s done enough,” she murmured.

“Candles get a turn.”

First, she lit the tree, soft coils of warm light blooming through the spruce.

Then, she turned to the table.

Three white jars waited in stillness.

One for the past.

One for the present.

One for whatever came next.

She didn’t speak the words,
but the way she paused between each flame made them ring louder than speech.

The room shifted, like it had taken a breath, and was holding it
to see what would happen next.

She didn’t say it. 

But the pause between each flame made it obvious.

The room shifted. 

The fairy lights steadied. 

The shadows softened their bite.

When she stepped back, everyone had gone still. 

Even the underfloor heat stilled, as if the bones of the house held their breath to hear what came next.

“Okay,” Aspen said, voice pitched low. 

“Welcome to Sequoia’s slightly pagan movie night.”

“That’s not what I called it,” she replied.

“What did you call it?” 

Mike asked.

She glanced at the candles, the snow breathing against the windows, the plate settings that waited like ritual.

“The Long Night,” she said.

Something in Kai’s ribs answered to that name.

He sat down on the couch.

The lights along the curtain lifted, just slightly.





¤¤¤¤¤




Mike




¤¤¤¤¤



Dinner was not a dinner so much as a slow orbit.

They passed plates and bowls and stories in a loose pattern: curry edging into jerk, gravey soaking bread, laughter dipping between bites.

Outside, the snow thickened.

Inside, time spread out.

Mike was the first to leave an empty space at the table.

He did not do it on purpose.

He just set a fifth plate and left it clean, fork and napkin folded neatly on top.

Sequoia noticed.

“Expecting someone?” she asked.

Mike frowned like he’d only just seen it.

“I don’t know,” he said. 

“My grandmother used to do that at Christmas. 

For whoever couldn’t be there. 

Or whoever had already gone.”

His voice softened on the last word.

“She said you never knew who might come hungry. 

Seen or unseen.”

Aspen shivered theatrically.

“Okay, ghost dinner.”

“It’s not ghosts,” Mike said quietly. 

“It’s just respect.”

He reached for the plantain chips, then paused, fingers resting against the bowl like he was listening through it.

No one had music on, but Kai watched his friend’s head tip slightly, like a man hearing a rhythm underneath the noise.

“You feel something?” 

Kai asked.

Mike shrugged one shoulder, not looking up.

“It’s always louder this time of year,” he said. 

“Old people in my family say the veil thins. 

Church people say it’s the ‘season of miracles.’ 

Backpack aunties say all of it is just different words for the same thing.”

He smiled, small and real.

“I Googled it once,” he added, almost embarrassed. 

“Turns out a lot of cultures think the dead visit around midwinter.

Candles in windows, empty chairs, that kind of thing. 

So if I look weird setting an extra plate…”

“It tracks,” Aspen said.

“Historically weird is my favorite kind of weird.”

Sequoia nodded.

“Let them sit,” she said, glancing at the empty place. 

“Nobody’s taking the fork away.”

Mike relaxed.

As they ate, Kai noticed small things:

When he laughed, the room felt older.

Like something that had been sleeping smiled too.

The way the candle nearest the empty plate burned steadier than the others.

The way the draft at the window stopped for a full minute, as if the house were holding its breath with someone else’s lungs.

The way Mike’s shoulders dropped by degrees, like a man being backed up by a crowd he could not see but trusted anyway.

Later, when they migrated back to the living room for the movie, Mike grabbed a blanket from the basket and spread it across two cushions without thinking.

He sat on one.

The other stayed empty.

Halfway through the film, he turned his head slightly and smiled at nothing.

“Feel like you just got roasted,” Aspen whispered.

“Yeah,” Mike muttered, “by people who remember when snow meant survival, not Instagram.”

He said it jokingly.

The warmth in his chest was not a joke at all.



¤¤¤¤¤




Sequoia




¤¤¤¤¤




They picked a movie with snow in it.

Of course they did.

Aspen had argued for a ridiculous Christmas romcom, Mike for a classic, Kai for “anything with less white savior energy than the last one,” and somehow Sequoia had chosen something quiet and foreign with subtitles, half about a family dinner, half about a girl hearing voices in the forest.

“Seasonal,” Aspen said. 

“Also, you just want us to read.”

“You’ll live,” she said, dimming the lamp.

The only light now came from the tree, the candles, and the television.

Outside, the snow brushed against the windows like someone trying to get a better look.

Sequoia sat nearest the tree.

From there she could feel it breathing.

Not literally, not with lungs, but with the slow, patient life of something that had survived months of cold in the dark earth and then been cut, carried, and dressed in lights to stand watch in their living room.

Her grandmother had told her stories about this.

Not just Christmas trees, but older things.

Evergreen branches nailed above doors to keep winter spirits out.

Pine and spruce hung in homes to remind people that not everything dies when the cold comes.

“People used to think trees held power,” her grandmother had said once.

“Still do,” Sequoia had replied.

She reached out now and touched one of the lower branches, fingers brushing the needles until the pine scent broke free, green and bright against the indoor air.

On the screen, a character lit a single candle in a window so her father could find his way home through a snowstorm.

Sequoia’s eyes tracked the flame.

“Ever notice everything this time of year is about light not giving up?” 

she asked quietly.

Mike hummed in agreement.

“Even in church,” he said. 

“They just changed the names.”

Aspen smirked.

“Blasphemy under the tree,” he whispered. 

“Bold move.”

“I said what I said,” Sequoia replied, soft but steady.

She glanced at the greenery she had hung over the doorway earlier.

Cedar. 

Spruce. 

A bit of holly for color.

Her aunt had called it “protection.”

Her science teacher would have called it “aromatic plant material.”

The feeling it left in the room did not care about language.

It was older than any of their names.

When the movie reached a scene where townspeople gathered around a bonfire to sing at the darkest point of the year, the candle flames on the coffee table leaned slightly toward the screen.

Sequoia saw it.

So did Kai.

Their eyes met across the room.

Neither said a word.

She did not need to read his mind to know he felt it too:

This was not about one holiday.

It was the same story, told through different songs, different books, different names for the same long night and the same stubborn light.

Then he felt it.

Not out loud, not in the way sound travels, but in the marrow.

A voice moved through the room like dusk speaking through stone,
coiled in command, velveted in smoke.

And it was coming from her.

Sequoia.

She hadn’t changed, and yet, the air around her had.

Not louder.

Deeper.

Older.

The kind of voice that once told kings when to kneel, or summoned storms to alter maps.

High priestess.

Oracle.

The Archive bleeding through skin.

Kai straightened, not from fear, but recognition.

The presence in her did not speak his name.

It didn’t need to.

His bones had already risen to answer.

And somewhere behind his ribs,
the part of him that remembered what gods looked like felt her voice bow to him, not in worship, but in recognition.



¤¤¤¤¤




Aspen




¤¤¤¤¤


Aspen got restless halfway through the movie.

It was a good restless, not an anxious one, the kind that usually turned into inspiration, trouble, or both.

He slid off the couch, padded into the kitchen, and came back with the leftover wings and cookies, balancing everything on an old wooden tray like some chaotic waiter from a pagan diner.

“We need a feast,” he announced in a whisper, setting the tray on the rug.

“We literally just ate,” Mike said.

“That was dinner,” Aspen replied.

“This is something else.”

He did not say what.

He didn’t have to.

He pulled a pack of paper crowns and stupid cardboard hats from his bag, the kind they stuffed into cheap holiday crackers at grocery stores this time of year.

“Absolutely not,” Sequoia said, eyeing the glitter.

“Too late,” Aspen said, already crowning Mike with a crooked gold band. 

“This is historically accurate nonsense, okay. 

People have been dressing up and acting like fools at midwinter longer than any of our last names have existed.”

“You looked that up too, huh,” Mike said.

Aspen smirked.

“Someone had to win at trivia night.”

He tossed a silver crown toward Kai. 

It bounced off his shoulder and landed in his lap.

Kai picked it up slowly, the flimsy cardboard shimmering against the dark fabric of his hoodie.

“I am not wearing that,” he said.

“Respect the lineage,” Aspen replied. 

“Besides, some old Roman somewhere is losing his mind at the idea of you not taking the crown.”

“Romans did this?” 

Sequoia asked, skeptical.

“Feasts, gift-giving, role reversing, wild parties while pretending the world might end,” Aspen said. 

“You can go full Google later.

 Saturnalia. 

You’d love it.”

There it was, the gentle invitation disguised as a joke.

Saturnalia.

Kai turned the crown in his hands.

Paper, cheap, ridiculous.

He put it on.

The lights brightened, almost imperceptibly.

No one mentioned it.

Aspen felt it again, that slow, searing hum in his blood whenever Kai was near.

Not desire alone, but something ritual, written into him like a spell half-awake.

His bones ached like they were tuning to Kai’s rhythm.

The Archive stirred behind his thoughts, quiet and watchful.

Letting him feel just enough to know:

the time was near.

That what burned in him was not just want, it was the old hunger, the one the incubus knew.

The one that needed to be tempered or it would devour.

And Kai,

Kai was the key.

Not to extinguish the fire.

To teach it how to worship.

Aspen took a seat on the floor between the couch and the coffee table, cross-legged, as if presiding over a low, disorganized court.

He passed food around again, tore cookies in half to make them go further, scooped punch from the punch bowl on the sideboard into small cups so no one had to get up.

He made sure Sequoia’s mug was always full, Mike’s chips replenished, Kai’s plate never empty for long.

It was chaotic service, but it was service.

When he spoke, his jokes cut tension.

When he laughed, the room followed.

When he stole a wing from the extra plate and then thought better of it, quietly replacing it, the candle nearest it flickered once as if in amusement.

Aspen, without knowing the word, held the old energy of a holiday that had once been about turning the world upside down so it could remember how to stand.

For one night, the serious became silly.

The rigid became soft.

The powerful poured wine for everyone else.

He did not own power yet, but he practiced the better version of it, kneeling on the floor, handing food to his friends, wearing a paper crown like a dare.




¤¤¤¤¤




The Quiet Between




¤¤¤¤¤


The movie ended on a shot of a girl standing in the snow, listening to something only she could hear.

Credits rolled.

No one reached for the remote right away.

The room hummed, not with electricity, but with the low, satisfied buzz of people who had eaten, laughed, and let the night soak through their skin.

Outside, the snow had thickened into a soft curtain.

Inside, the candles burned lower.

Sequoia blew two of them out, leaving one still lit in the center of the table.

“For whoever needs it,” she said.

Mike’s gaze flicked to the empty plate and back.

Aspen yawned, then grabbed a blanket and threw half of it over Kai’s legs without asking, like it had always belonged there.

Kai did not move it.

His body had that bone-deep tired walk home from practice kind of ache, mixed with something else, something that felt like a chord holding its last note before the next song started.

He leaned his head back against the couch and let his eyes close.

The room unfolded around him in layers:

Sequoia’s steady presence, like roots under snow.

Mike’s listening silence, tuned just beyond the noise.

Aspen’s bright, restless hum, always two breaths ahead of mischief.

The single candle on the table breathed small, golden.

It was Christmas on the calendar.

On some deeper, older clock, it was the long night when people of every kind once stayed awake, lit fires, shared food, and told stories to convince themselves the sun would come back.

Kai’s mother would’ve set a nativity scene on her dresser.

His grandmother burned incense for ancestors.

His neighbor across the street was already hanging red envelopes on her interior door frame for a new year that hadn’t arrived yet.

All of it layered, overlapping, like translucent songs.

Somewhere inside the stillness,
Kai felt it, the echo of another soul who had looked inward
and found him there, as if their gazes had met across the infinite
and neither had looked away.

The sensation left goosebumps trailing his arms.

Not fear.

Recognition.

A love too ancient to be new,
too exact to be chance.

He exhaled slowly, the thought rising without language:

I feel it too.

He felt them in his chest now, those layers, thrumming against his sternum.

Like a thread being pulled a little tighter.

Across the lake.

Across countries.

Across time.

He felt everything.

Even the hidden warmth in the floors hushed, as if the house knew a story was about to step through.

But something else was there, in the way the light clung to him, in the way the shadows leaned, in the way the air tasted suddenly of salt, stone, and the memory of torches on a ridge far away.

He did not have language for it.

He had only the feeling, the same one that had been growing all November under the floodlights at Lorne Park, the same hum that had woken him at 3:33 a.m. more than once with his heart pounding like he had just been called by name.

He opened his eyes.

The candle flame sharpened, just for a moment, then settled.

“You good?” 

Mike asked, voice quiet.

Kai nodded.

“Yeah,” he said. 

“Just thinking.”

“Dangerous pastime,” Aspen murmured.

Sequoia smiled without looking.

“He’s anchoring,” she said, almost to herself. 

“Let him be.”

Nobody argued.

They drifted then toward the small rituals that end evenings: stacking plates, rinsing cups, pulling on boots softened by salt and wear.

Mike slipped a leftover cookie into a napkin and left it beside the extra plate.

“For the road,” he said.

Sequoia pinched out the last candle with damp fingers, then opened the window a crack to let the night breathe through.

Aspen stole his own crown back from Kai’s head and jammed it in his pocket.

“Evidence,” he said. 

“That we survived another year.”

They stood in the doorway for a moment, all four of them, framed by evergreen, breath mixing in the cold air creeping through the gap.

“Text me when you get home,” Sequoia said, in the tone of someone who said it every time and meant it every time.

“Group call, midnight on New Year’s,” Aspen added.

“Mandatory chaos check-in.”
Mike bumped Kai’s shoulder gently.

“You feel like this night is older than us?” he asked.

Kai exhaled, slow.

“Yeah,” he said. 

“I think it’s been waiting a long time.”

“For what?” 

Aspen asked.

None of them answered right away.

Outside, a distant siren wailed, then faded.

A gust of snow swept across the porch, tasting like lake wind and something that had once burned on another continent under another sky.

“For us to remember,” Sequoia said at last.

The word hung there, simple and enormous.

They stepped out into the snow.

The door closed behind them with a soft click.

Above the house, the sky was starless, a low, luminous gray.

Somewhere beyond it, the earth turned its face the slightest degree toward morning.

Physically active and in solid shape at 195 lbs—happy to swap pics once we’re chatting.

When I’m not chasing sunbeams or iced coffee, I’m usually planning my next trip. Travel has been a big part of my life lately, and I’ve got some exciting plans lined up for Asia and Europe next year. I also want to check out more of the West Coast and Midwest.

Live music is a big love of mine. Whether it’s a packed venue or an outdoor summer show, I’m always down to see a band I love. My playlists bounce around from alt rock to electro to indie, but I'm open to almost anything—even country if you've got the right track to convert me. Oh, and I’ve been learning salsa… slowly. Let’s just say I’ve got the enthusiasm down, the steps are a work in progress

Outside of that, I’m a big fan of manga, the occasional anime, and I’m deep into board games and indie video games. Slay the Spire, Hades, and Fallout: New Vegas are my current favorites. I also like cooking (especially seasonal recipes), baking, dancing, a bit of swimming and being cozy.

If any of that sounds like your kind of energy, I’d love to hear from you. Looking to connect with someone 25+ preferably on the East Coast—but if you're elsewhere in the US and we click, I’m open to seeing where it goes.

1p3evnj,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1p3evnj/why_is_it_so_hard_to_maintain_friendships_these/,Why is it so hard to maintain friendships these days,"Is it a lack of trying or everybody is too busy with their own problems? 
As a female with no real best friend it makes me sad to think about.  

Friendships are hard to maintain because no one tells you how *much maintenance* they actually require. You grow up thinking friends are these magical, self-sustaining creatures—like houseplants that somehow water themselves. But no. They’re more like emotional sourdough starters: ignore them for a few days and suddenly you’re questioning every life choice you’ve ever made while scraping off weird metaphorical mold.

The problem is that everyone’s running their own full-time circus in the background. You’re juggling work, family, sleep deprivation, existential dread, and that weird noise your car has been making for six months—while simultaneously trying to remember your friend’s birthday, relationship drama timeline, and preferred emotional support snack. And your friend? They’re busy starring in *their* chaos show and don’t always remember to text back, which of course spirals into, “Are we okay?” for absolutely no reason.

Then there’s the logistics. Making plans with an adult friend is basically a collaborative hostage negotiation. You suggest coffee, they can’t do Tuesday. They suggest Saturday, you have a thing. You propose next week, they respond two weeks later. Suddenly it’s three months later and you’re sending a “we should totally hang!!!” text that everyone knows is a lie.

And let’s not forget growth. People change! Which is beautiful in theory but deeply inconvenient when you’ve built an entire friendship dynamic on who you *used to be*. You wake up one morning like, “When did you become an early-morning hiking person? I met you in the era of 2 a.m. waffle runs—what is this?”

But the real kicker is that friendships don’t explode dramatically like romantic relationships. They dissolve quietly. Someone gets busy. Someone else stops reaching out. You both assume the other doesn’t care, even though you both absolutely do. It’s tragic, really—two people sitting on opposite ends of the void, too tired to send a ‘hey.’

Yet despite how absurdly hard they are to maintain, the good ones—when you get them—are basically a glitch in the universe. Two humans deciding, out of *everyone* on Earth, “Yeah, you. Let’s try to do life at the same time.” And that’s why we keep trying, even when we’re terrible at it.

1p3erm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p3erm3/wife_wont_speak_to_me/,Wife won’t speak to me,"Last night my wife(32f) and I (35m) got in a fight. She was out with some friends and I picked up the kids from school(3pm) and then went home to finish replacing my cars brakes. The kids played in the yard while I worked for a bit then went inside and played and around 5pm I ordered pizza and wrapped up the brake job. 

My wife got home (6:30pm) to us having pizza  watching a movie in a house that was a relatively normal level of clean and noise. She noticed the kids had opened up and played with some toys/paint kits that were promised to a friend of ours for a silent auction and she blew up. I can’t remember if she yelled or just raised her voice but by the end of her tirade our 11yo daughter was in tears and ran upstairs crying. At this point I talked with my wife and took the blame, as our daughter had told us she played with the toys and paints while I was outside working on our car and I hadn’t even noticed.

My wife said she already was blaming me and was angry with me not our daughter. So I went upstairs to calm our daughter down and assure her that her mom was angry with me and not her. She was still crying when I got there and after a moment of talking and letting her know I was at fault here and the only thing she should have done was ask me before using brand new toys/paints that hadn’t been opened yet. she calmed down and I went to parenting asking what are some things she should try in the future to avoid this and gave her a few things I would try to do better. Her first answer was “I could not be alive, that would make everyone’s lives better.”

It’s worth noting two things here, number one our daughter has said things like this before, most recently earlier this week when she wrote a series of notes stating she hated herself and thought she was a bad kid, and my wife asked me to talk with her. We had that talk and it felt very productive and by the end she was happier and we had a plan to work on improving self talk and certain behaviors that she gets in trouble for. 

Number two is that I’m not her biological father. So when she said this I assured her we all wanted her alive and loved her very much. After that i invited her back downstairs to finish the movie and her response was she was scared to go back downstairs because of mom. Her mom does have a temper and often reacts to minor inconveniences with big outbursts especially when overwhelmed. 

This leads back to my not being her bio dad, my options are generally limited and it’s not like I can take her away from her mom. But I was angry that things like this keep happening and when my wife asked me to talk with our daughter earlier this week it seemed like something similar must have happened because she doesn’t react like this when she’s in trouble with me.

Now here’s the part where I may have been an asshole. I went back downstairs to confront my wife, but stayed in control and kept it to a simple starting statement of, “You need to work on controlling your anger in these situations.” Maybe not the most diplomatic, but certainly better than what I felt like saying. At this point she tried to brush me off as if I was making her more angry. She tried to walk around me and ignore me so I stepped in front of her and leaned in so we were eye to eye and said it again and also added that our daughter said she felt like she shouldn’t be alive. At this point it turned into a fight and my wife told me I had been to aggressive with her. From what I remember I just leaned in to look her in the eyes and show I was serious since I have a tendency to joke around a lot. She took it as me threatening her though. I understand how it could have been seen that way as I am much larger than her and I got my face a few inches from her face. But I didn’t yell or even raise my voice. 

From that point it turned into how I handled the situation and not our daughter going through these episodes. We fought and the kids heard and cried and I reaffirmed that we needed to keep our heads and not get 8/10 angry for 2/10 issues. She refused to listen or actually talk about the issues and today hasn’t talked to me at all.

It’s besides the point, but her birthday was Monday and we had already decided to celebrate today because her ex would have the kids all night after school so I could take her out. I attempted to talk with her multiple times, gave her the gift I had gotten her and treated her as if it were her birthday like I had planned. Flowers, coffee, cleaned out gassed up and filled her car with her favorite snacks.  Shes ignored me all day and just made me cancel our reservation at a restaurant we both wanted to try. 

So am I the asshole?

TLDR: my daughter used some stuff she shouldn’t have, my wife blew up on her so bad that my daughter cried and said she shouldn’t even be alive and I got mad at my wife for blowing up and started an even bigger fight. Now my wife won’t talk to me.",25,1763770155.0,AITAH,59,0.86,False

[Long Live the Empire!](https://www.noplotonlylore.com/one-page-rpgs/long-live-the-empire)

Switching up the format a bit today! Seems like a good time for it. A high-stakes game of reputation and manners set in a galaxy-spanning empire, like a Star Wars regency drama starring that guy Vader choked that one time. 

**What I Like About This One:**

I love player-driven drama. As we saw in Me, My Demon, and I, there’s something I find compelling about mechanics that let you screw with other people, or the idea that another player around the table can be like ‘Nah, make that harder.’ It’s a fun political level to play with, giving players a bit of pull in deciding how difficult something should be. 

The idea of high-stakes social is also something that intrigues me in games. We have a ton of games about high-stakes physical striving, but the truth of the matter is, we’re much more in tune with the socio-political dangers of the world. Maybe that’s part of the escapist ideal of games like Dungeons & Dragons, but I find the idea of “Say it politely or die” much more compelling in my fiction. 

**What I’d Do Differently Next Time:** 

Pens! Why do you thwart me so!?!? The section that starts with “Play Begins” is kind of out-of-order in a way that I would find infuriating as a player. I remember one of my biggest pet peeves with Palladium books back in the day was the way that their core books were laid out, with rules for character creation and races and classes all over the damned place, and here I am with specific interjection moves before I’ve completed the basic play loop? Well, I never…

1p3epy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/familydrama/comments/1p3epy2/how_do_i_have_a_relationship_with_my_cousins/,How do I have a relationship with my cousin’s daughter but not my cousin?,"I kicked my cousin out of my life but I really miss her daughter who I was very close with.

I have a cousin I was close with for years. We bonded over toxic family upbringing. We were not close at all and rarely saw each other growing up but around our early adult years we reconnected. I am 35 now and she is almost 40 if not already 40. She got married about 11 years ago and they tried desperately to start a family. She has a lot of health issues that really made it hard and she had a few miscarriages. She finally got pregnant but around that time I started noticing issues between her and her husband. She lived about 3 hours from me and one day she called me and said she’s in the hospital because her husband and her got into a huge fight and he pushed her to the ground while she was about 8 months pregnant. She’s completely separated from him right after that and basically since then she hasn’t had contact with him unless it was for court. So I stepped in to help her as much as I could. I was there by her side while she was having a c-section and stayed for a while after she got home to help out. 

Throughout the next few years I was there any time she needed me. As I mentioned before she had many health issues including type 1 diabetes which she struggled with after giving birth. I still lived 3 hours away but for a couple years I was going to college and wasn’t really working. Literally anytime there was an emergency I was there to help and I became very close with her daughter. 

Her health issues had become so bad I recommended she move closer to me as she wasn’t working and it would be easier for her to move versus me and my husband moving. I ended up getting a decent job after college and my husband was well established at his. This was so she could utilize both me, my husband, his family, and even build a community with our friends. I tried not to pressure her but once I got a stable job is was hard for me to come for every emergency. Which was sadly very often. She always made comments of how she wished we could move closer to her because it’s so safe, the best schools, and etc etc. We did get into an argument about all of this because when she finally did get a job it was a work from home job and she was still having serious health issues. Not to mention any time they wanted to visit we would 95% of the time drive down to see her. It became very stressful after a while and I just felt like it was an uneven relationship. She would occasionally ask for money because she didn’t always have stable work. Once she did get a good job that paid well she took her and her daughter on expensive trips. But still occasionally ask for money. She had lost that job and Eventually she decided to move…..to South Carolina because she said the schools there were the best in the country and there were many more opportunities there than where I lived. She doesn’t have a degree so she was limited. I told her if she moved she would then have zero support. She pretty much only had me and my husband and 2 friends anyways so she didn’t see it as much of a difference. 

Anyways she had always commented on how the area I lived in was poor, poor schools, poor neighborhoods, no job opportunities, etc. Yet, me living in that area I went to college, got a decent job, have amazing friends, surrounded by family (the ones I kept) and live a beautiful life! Anyways, fast forward to me going to SC to visit and at this point she has been out of work for over a year and I’m unsure how she is affording her $1500 apartment. She did say she was using her 401k but would soon run out. Meanwhile her daughter is in the “best” school in the country and (she is 9 then) and she can’t read. I found this out as I had gotten her a phone (with her mom’s approval) and I told her she could text me any time. She then said, I’ll have to call you because I don’t know how to text “ I said no problem I’ll show you how to use your phone. Which she then replied, I don’t know how to read. I was confused but honestly not that shocked as her mom didn’t really active in her leaning or teaching her how to do stuff. She very much coddled her and that’s when things started to click. My cousin’s health was worse than I thought, her blood sugar constantly dropping so she would eat half a donut. She hardly ate anything all day and when she did it was a sweet or a sugary coffee. Her mental health was alarming as she would let her daughter play on her iPad all day without much interaction and my cousin was frantically and oddly looking for things around the house. Her daughter sleeps with her every night and so the one time she stayed at her friends house she went to the mom’s room and said she had to sleep with her. Anytime her daughter asked for something she got it except the one time she asked for fruit and my cousin said no it’ll just go to waste but proceeded to buy her gum. My cousin also bought herself several bathing suits and other things mind you she wasn’t working AND asked for me to get groceries while I was there. 

She started talking about how much she hated living in the states and she wanted to leave the country. I started asking her some questions and she said that she wanted to leave because women’s rights are being taken away and her daughter (who is 9) wouldn’t be able to get an abo?&$tion if she wanted to. 

Fast forward to almost a year later, still no job, her money is basically out if not out already and still asking for money. But she bought them tickets and moved to France. It just gets messier and messier and eventually this relationship was stressing me out so much I had to cut it out. 

I did file a missing person’s report because she had asked me for money, I said no, and she just disappeared, in a foreign country, no where to live, no food, no fridge to store her insulin. I’m telling you it was stressful knowing her daughter is being dragged around. 

About a week later I saw she was on instagram so I messaged her. Still no response and about 28 hours later she finally reached out. She said they met some amazing friends who let her rent an apartment that they owned but it doesn’t have electricity right now. She said the rent is cheaper than her SC apartment but can’t afford food. Then it was very close to her visa expiring and I asked her what is her plan? How will she afford to come back to the states to fix her papers so she can try to get another visa? She said her “best friend” (mind you she’s barely been there 6 months) who is a lawyer said 1. They can’t kick her out of the apartment she is staying in so she’ll stay there and she doesn’t have to leave the country to fix her papers. Am I wrong or has she completely gone delu-lu???

I told her she can come and stay near us and we can help her get on her feet. She said she rather be poor and honestly I’m France than America any day. That was when I finally let go of all the things on my chest and heart and then cut her off. 

It’s been about 2 months and I blocked her from everything and now I’m regretting it because I really miss her daughter. I am dying to know how she’s doing, how is she getting along at school? What is she doing for fun? Has she made any friends? What’s her favorite thing about living in France? The last time I asked her that her mom responded for her. I’m missing out on her life. Is she ok? Does she want to leave? Is she happy? 

Do I try to reach out to my cousin and try to establish that I only want a relationship with her daughter? But how? She’s going to be 10 in February just 15 days after my birthday and how do I let her know I still care for her and love her and thinking of her? That no matter what I do always want to be there for her….just not her mom. How do I proceed?

1p3epdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthAmericanPantheon/comments/1p3epdf/fuck_hipaa_my_new_patient_doesnt_even_need/,"Fuck HIPAA. My new patient doesn't even need treatment, she just needs someone to break her out of here","Between 1984 and 1988, an undisclosed metro area in the southeastern United States suffered a spat of violent murders.

The victims had no commonalities. Age, gender, color, appearance, occupation, socioeconomic status — nothing matched. Victims included middle school students and notorious cartel members, street cops and lawyers, charity directors and investment bankers, pharmaceutical executives and gas station clerks. 

The only reason authorities had any idea that the murders were related was because of the killer’s unique calling card:

A scattering of blood-drenched pigeon feathers.

As months passed and the body count mounted, law enforcement came into possession of one single piece of eyewitness testimony:

Following the violent death of a firefighter, a middle-aged woman was spotted limping away from the scene, bleeding profusely from a gaping wound in her hip. According to the witness the woman was tiny, birdlike in her thinness, shuffling like someone elderly. Notably, a flock of pigeons followed her, bobbing along beside her like an urban adaptation of the pied piper.

This sighting was ultimately dismissed due to one impossible detail:

The woman was covered in grey feathers.

A second sighting was reported one year later, and was again dismissed. Similar sightings continued to crop up over the years, every one of them ignored.

In 1988 and entirely by chance, a bloody feather came into possession of AHH during the commission of a separate task. The feathers were then brought to NASCU. Peculiarities surrounding the appearance and physiology of the feathers were noted by specialized personnel, most notably T-Class Agent Wolf. 

At this time, the agency launched an investigation of its own. 

The investigation culminated in July 1988. During surveillance of the target — a very thin woman who was always trailed by a flock of pigeons, and who always wore a long, heavy trenchcoat, even in the humid summer heat — she managed to infiltrate a house that functioned as a front for human trafficking. 

What resulted was a bloodbath.

 

The target was badly wounded and therefore sufficiently weakened due to the energy expended during the attack. Agency personnel were able to take her into custody. Her capture was not without incident, as the flock of pigeons surrounding her began to attack. One pigeon, a particularly large male with one eye, refused to leave her side. As a result, the animal was brought into custody with her. He was later observed to pluck his feathers and place them on top of the woman’s astounding number of serious wounds.

Incredibly, the feathers facilitated rapid healing.

It must be noted that the woman came into Agency custody during a time when consideration and respect for our extraordinary inmates was at a low ebb. Due to her dress, her age, her general appearance, and of course her flock of pigeons, personnel dubbed the entity The Bag Lady.

The Bag Lady is a middle-aged woman of almost extraordinary thinness. Her hair is short and grey. Her eyes are large and a vivid, bright orange identical in hue to the eyes of the pigeon who came into custody with her.

Like her pigeon, she is covered in feathers. 

Unlike many inmates, the Bag Lady is articulate, intelligent, and possesses full speech and language capabilities. Nevertheless,  for the entire length of her incarceration, the Bag Lady has refused to speak with staff for any meaningful length of time. When asked why, her answer is always the same:

“Because I don’t talk to cops.”

This is admittedly understandable, given that the Bag Lady acted in an exclusively extrajudicial capacity, to extremely violent effect. 

Despite decades of consistent questioning and other, less savory methods to break her down, the Bag Lady has continued to refuse meaningful engagement with Agency personnel. In fact, the only meaningful contact the Bag Lady has had with personnel consists of attacks both attempted and achieved.

On four different occasions, however, she has been observed attempting to engage fellow inmates in conversation. 

Notably, the Bag Lady speaks extensively and frequently to her pigeon. The pigeon does not answer, but Agency personnel believe the bird is extraordinarily intelligent and that it communicates with her nonverbally. Due to potential similarities with the inmate called the Heart Bird, the pigeon is as closely monitored as the Bag Lady herself. Concerns over such similarities with the Heart Bird are the primary reason that the Bag Lady has never been evaluated for termination.

Fortunately, the inmate’s thirty-five year vow of silence was recently broken during an interview with T-Class agent Rachele B. The insights provided are fascinating. The content of the interview poses serious questions regarding the nature of death, free will, the possibility and potential purpose of afterlife, and the processes through which Khthonic entities come into being.

One might even dare to say it provides a few answers as well.

The first thing my son ever bought was birdseed.

He was four years old. His grandma put two dollars in his Christmas card that year, and he spent those dollars on pigeon food.

Michael loved pigeons. He started talking to them before he ever said a word to me. Watched them from windows when he was a baby and cooed at them the way they coo at each other. His first smile was at them, not at me. His first hello went to a baby pigeon blinking stupidly in a nest on our fire escape.

He loved them.

As he got older, that love grew stronger. By the time he was kindergarten, those birds would follow him everywhere, bobbing their little heads. They ate out of his hands, flew down to his arms, sometimes even landed on his head which made him laugh like nothing else. 

I’d been afraid of birds my whole life, so I didn’t understand. I asked him one time why he loved them so much. How he could make friends with them.

“It’s easy, Mom,” he said. “Pigeons think everyone’s their friend. They already love you. All you do is love them back.”

I still didn’t understand. Didn’t really want to, I guess. I grew up learning that pigeons were vermin. Dirty, ugly, unsanitary, brainless disease carriers. No, I didn’t understand at all.

But I did understand this:

Like pigeons, my son thought everyone was his friend. 

When describing Michael, you might use the word “gullible.” But that isn’t right. He wasn’t gullible. He was smart, he was intuitive, he understood everyone. He could look at the worst person alive and find the smallest, weakest spark of goodness flickering forlornly in the vast dark.

What he couldn’t understand — what I couldn’t make him understand no matter how hard I tried, how loud I yelled, how mean or desperate or cruel I got — was that a spark is not light.

A spark is just a spark. No more, and maybe less.

I could tell you about Michael’s friends. How some were born monsters. How some were made. How badly the ones that were made—the ones that weren’t born ruined— heart my hurt.

And how that spark of sympathy got my guard just enough to make sure I lost my son.

I saw him for the last time when he was seventeen.

We were fighting about his friends. Not the pigeons, I’d gotten used to them a long time ago. How they clustered around the fire escape every morning waiting for him to open the window, how they flocked down to the building entrance when it was time for him to leave for work, how his favorite bird, Mr. One-Eye, dive-bombed onto his shoulder every time they saw each other. 

No, we weren’t fighting about pigeons. We were fighting about his other friends.

It wasn’t even a bad fight. Not worse than any of our other fights, anyway. It went the same way it always did, he told me I didn’t understand like he always did, I told him he was being a little fool and his friends would be the end of him like I always did.

And he walked out the door to cool off, like he always did.

I thought he’d call a few hours later, apologizing and asking for an apology in return like he always did.

But he didn’t call.

I told myself he’d come home, like he always did.

But he didn’t come home.

And nobody cared.

My boy never coming back was the worst thing. The very, very worst thing that is, was, or will ever be.

But the fact that no one helped, that no one cared, that no one gave the tiniest spark of a damn, was almost as terrible.

I went to the police seventeen times. Seventeen. One for each year he’d been alive. Each time they told me Michael was practically an adult, we’d had a fight, and he was fully in his rights not to come home. One cop even had the gall to me it was about time he stopped coming home. Another one said I was lucky he was gone, because otherwise he’d probably come home one day and cut my throat for drug money.

The last cop took pity on me. She was a lady officer. Lady is the wrong word. She was a battle ax. Built like a brick shithouse, with hair like rusty steel wool and the scariest eyes I have ever seen. 

But when she looked at me after I taking my seventeenth report, there was nothing scary about her eyes. They were only tired. Sad. And lightless.

That look in her eyes was how I knew no one would ever find my son, and that was the scariest thing of all.

“Listen to me, hon,” she said. “This is going to sound like the worst thing in the world. That’s because it is. But it’s also the only true thing anyone in this department is going to tell you. We have almost no resources. The few resources that we do have? They go to priorities. A dopehead dropout won’t ever be a priority. But you can bet your ass some of the cops here will make it their priority to end a dopehead, especially one who’s a peewee gangbanger. No one is going to help you. No one is going to do anything about it because no one cares about your son but you.”

“You’re wrong,” I told her, even though I knew she wasn’t.

I didn’t give up. I’ll never give up on my boy. I went to other places for help. Citizen groups, social services, activists, community foundations, charities, all those places. At first it was wonderful. At first I thought I’d found my people, because unlike the cops they listened. They listened when I told them about my son, about how the first thing he ever bought was birdseed and how the first word he ever said was for a baby pigeon and how Mr. One-Eye rode on his shoulder and how he could look at the worst person alive and find the good. They listened to me and they gave me hugs and coffee and cookies and prayers and recommendations to grief groups and then they listened again.

But they didn’t *do* anything about it.

Finally, I’d had enough of people who didn’t do anything about anything.

When I said so to one of the group leaders — the one who was the best listener, the one who held my hands whenever I cried — said, “We’re your people. We’re here for you. We care about you.”

Grief and rage and frustration erupted. The most acute, potent frustration I’d ever felt, the kind that renders you mindless. “I need you to care about my son.”

“I understand. I hear you.”

“No. No. You’re wrong. I think you’re wrong. I think you haven’t heard a goddamn word I said.”

“I have. I do. I’m always here for you. I’m listening. But…”

“*But what?”*

She looked at me, eyes tired and full of pity. “We only have as much as we have. We can only do what we can with what we have. What else do you want me to do?”

“I need you to do something about it,” I said.

But she didn’t.

No one did. No one but me.

And I kept on keeping on. Not because I wanted to, but because sometimes that’s all you get: The ability to put one foot in front of the other. Left, right. Left, right until you get somewhere else.

Only I couldn’t get anywhere else.

The pigeons couldn’t, either. They didn’t seem to understand that Michael was gone. As the days after his disappearance bled into weeks and the weeks hemorrhaged into months, the pigeons kept coming. Flocking to the fire escape outside our little window waiting for him to pop out with smiles and birdseed. His favorite pigeon, Mr. One-Eye, even took to following me whenever I left the building. He watched me as if to say, *Where is he? Where did he go? Tell him we’re waiting. Tell him we love him. Tell him we need him to come back*.

I couldn’t help but wonder how they were feeling. If they were just confused and maybe a little hurt in their little birdbrains, or if they understood. If they hurt as much as me, if they had holes in their hearts like me. Rotting, bottomless voids eating them from the inside out every second of every day. 

But I didn’t know how to ask, and they wouldn’t have been able to answer anyway.

And then Mr. One-Eye stopped showing up.

He stayed gone for one day, then two, then three and four and five and that’s when I knew he wasn’t coming back either. I hated that damned bird for leaving me. He was Michael’s favorite. Michael had pigeons the way I’d had dogs, and that particular pigeon was his heart. Mr. One-Eye was the closest thing my sweet boy had to a soul mate.

So if even that bird had given up on him, he was truly gone.

The sixth day after Mr. One-Eye’s absence was grey and wet somehow dead. Rain sheeted from the sky, but without any ferocity, without any power. It felt tired, hopeless, helpless to stop itself from falling. 

I was kicking my way home from work, tired and hopeless and helpless as the rain. I didn’t want to go to work. I didn’t want to come home from work, either. I didn’t want to walk. But I was still walking. Eyes down, one foot in front of the other. Left, right. Left, right. All rain could do was fall, grey rain on grey streets. All I could do was walk, grey girl on grey streets.

And then, out of the corner of my eye, so colorful it was almost obscene, I saw something.

Brightness against the rain-slick concrete, a small explosion of and white grey and sloppy wet red.

I almost ignored it. One foot in front of the other because that’s all you can do. Left, right. Left, right. Shoes slapping the sidewalk, dull and pointless, grey and empty.

But that explosion of white and red didn’t stay an explosion. It began to resolve. To take form. 

And the form it took was blood-caked feathers. 

The form it took was a crumpled grey chest shimmering all pink and green and white as it panted. A pigeon. A pigeon some asshole had kicked out of the way, or maybe even stepped on, and left to die. A pigeon who hadn’t run away from danger because it thought everyone was its friend, and what friend would ever be a danger?

I had never seen anything so pathetic. I almost left it.

But then I thought of Michael, and couldn’t bear to leave it there.

As I approached it, something bloomed in my chest. A feeling. I couldn’t figure out what that feeling was, only that it was suffocating.

I stopped and looked at the pigeon. It looked back with a single orange eye, fever-bright and fading even as I watched. 

It turned its head weakly.

And that’s when I saw it was missing an eye.

The sheer weight of grief forced me to my knees. But that weight couldn’t keep me from crawling across the grey, flooded sidewalk. It couldn’t keep me from scooping up that bright bloody explosion with desperate tenderness. It couldn’t keep me from cradling that Mr. One-Eye to my chest like I’d cradled my son a lifetime ago. 

I sat there in the rain until long after night fell, sobbing and holding the bird to my heart long after he stopped moving. People passing by took me for homeless. A few dropped coins into my lap. One lady even knelt down and tried to coax me to a shelter down the road, til I screamed in her face and spat.

No one stopped to help me after that. 

At some point, I stood up and staggered home. I brought Mr. One-Eye with me, holding him to my heart all the while.

I got drunk that night. Blind, stinking, hideously drunk. Not because I like drinking. I hate it. But I hated having to feel the hole in my heart more. This rotting void, a bottomless chasm eating me from the inside out every second of every day. It felt like I should be dead. Only I wasn’t. I felt like I was always dying but never got to be dead. 

Dead would have been better, but I couldn’t die. If I died then no one on earth would care what happened to my baby.

So I got drunk instead of dead. I didn’t really think it would work. I hoped that it would. I always hope. Hope is the only thing some of us ever get.

But being drunk didn’t work. 

Being drunk just made me angrier and crazier. Being drunk made the rotting pit inside me grow up and out until it was swallowing me whole. Until it was the only thing in the world. Until it was the only thing I knew, the only thing I had ever known, the only thing I would ever know. 

I thought I was by myself in that void, until I looked out the window and saw the pigeons on the fire escape. They alone were there in the pit with me. They alone understood. They alone cared what had happened to my son. 

So I opened the window by the fire escape and told them to come inside, sobbing every word. They swirled back in a panic, wings thundering. 

“No,” I wept. “No, don’t leave. Don’t leave. Come in. Come in here you goddamned morons, come in.”

I reached for them.

Everything tilted. The metal window sill bit into my belly, then scraped down my legs as the world flipped upside down.

The last thing I knew was the rush of wings, deafening but soft.

Beautifully, perfectly, profoundly soft.

For the first time that I could remember, I woke up in somebody’s arms.

I opened my eyes.

A face looked down at me. An old man with round golden eyes and the gentlest smile I have ever seen, will probably ever see.

I craned my neck. Pigeons surrounded us, a shifting, bright-eyed flock so huge it spilled off the sidewalks into the street. Their eyes shone like embers in the dark.

I looked back at the man. His eyes shone too, and so did the skin of his face. He wasn’t human. He couldn’t be. For some reason, that didn’t frighten me at all.

“Who are you?” I crane my neck. “Are you an angel?”

“No. I am One Who Listens.”

It sounds ridiculous, but I could literally *hear* the big letters in that title. They came out of his mouth capitalized.

“Who listens to what?” 

“I listen to prayers. I listen to pain. I listen to rage. I listened to yours, you know.” He smiled again, teeth shimmering.

“Then why…” I blinked and shifted, groaning as electric pain bolted up my hip. “If you listened to me, why didn’t you ever answer?”

“Because We Who Listen can never answer loudly. Sometimes we cannot answer at all. Each answer, however soft and quiet, takes from us. Often it takes something we aren’t supposed to give. Always, it gives something we can never get back. See.” It held out its bare arms for my inspection. My stomach churned violently as the streetlight illuminated a relief map of pitted scars and wormlike welts and suppurating rotted pits like radiation burns. 

“What happened?” I gasped.

“I listened, and I answered.” He shook his silvery sleeves back down over his arms. “My answers took what I did not have to give.”

Frustration bubbled up, hot and poisonous. “If you can’t do anything, then…I mean, what’s the point?”

“There is no point, I think,” he said gently. “It simply is.” 

“Are you a guardian angel?” I repeated.

“We are not guardians,” it said, gently. “We are listeners.”

“Who is we?”

“Me”. He placed a hand on his chest. “You.” He pressed his other hand against my chest. “We.”

I looked at him, revolted as terror built in my gut. “Am I dead?”

“There is no death for us.”

“I’m sorry, but I do *not* understand.”

“We who were suffering, we who were alone, now go to others who are suffering and alone. We stay with them and we listen. We listen so they can feel comfort.”

I had so many questions, but couldn’t articulate a single one. “And you —you were you with me? You saw my…my pain, all that rage, heard all those questions?”

“Yes.”

“Well, I never felt you.”

“I know. Sometimes, that is the way it is. But still we try. Still, we do what we must do.”

“You said you answered. That’s why you’re hurt. You gave answers to someone. Who?” I sat up, grimacing as my arm twanged. “And why wasn’t it me?”

Before he could tell me, I looked down at my hands. Incredibly, I was still holding Mr. One-Eye. Even more incredibly, he was still alive. His poor sunken eye fixed me with a dulled orange gaze.

And something shot me in the heart.

The force of a freight train, burning just like a bullet, boring through me. Instead of smoke, it left a question in its wake:

*hurts stop it stop it hurting stop please*

Without thinking — only feeling— I cradled Mr. One-Eye to my chest and held him.

Pain erupted in my shoulder, overwhelming and familiar. The rotting void, endless and eternal, boring a tunnel to my very core, manifesting as a caving wound.

But this time, it didn’t spread.

It didn’t grow. It didn’t swallow me and the world surrounding. It did not become the only thing I had known, or the only thing I knew, or the only thing I would ever know. It stayed where it was, confined to its tunnel. It had no choice, because there was something more important in my hands. Something bright and living. Something alive and whole.

Mr. One-Eye shifted his wings, then stretched upward. I raised him so he could look at me. His beautiful, sparkling orange eye met mine.

Then he stretched out, beak catching the fabric of my coat, and stepped onto my shoulder.

For the first time since my son was born, I felt whole. 

He Who Listens wasn’t quite so thrilled.

“What have you done?” he wailed. Tears welled in his great yellow eyes as he stared at the ghastly wound in my arm. I stared, too. I couldn’t help it. It looked as rotten as it felt, a huge, ruptured wound tunneling through my arm. “It will never go away. It will never fade. It will only grow. You will have that wound and feel that pain growing until it finally consumes you.”

Before I could say a word, Mr. One-Eye flapped his wings. The feathers whacked my face, shockingly strong. 

Immediately, the pigeons around us responded.

They came in a bobbing grey wave, pooling around my feet where the began to preen. As I watched, the dropped their preened feathers — glistening, shimmering grey overlaid with every color of the rainbow — at my feet.

When the last pigeon had dropped the last feather, Mr. One-Eye tucked his head under his wing and pulled out a feather of his own. Then he crept his way down my arm —one foot in front of the other, left, right, left right —and placed his feather inside my wound. 

The feather lay atop it for a moment, shining. Then it melted into that rotting crater, leaving a delicate thread of whole, unblemished flesh stretched across the hole.

I reached down and grabbed the pile of feathers at my feet, stuffing it into the hole. It was like magic. It *was* magic. Each feather shone and melted into fresh flesh. Two handfuls later, there was no wound. After three, there wasn’t even a scar.

By the end, even the pain was gone.

I laughed.

It felt alien to laugh, rusty, even wrong. But it came out anyway, erupting out of me like a geyser. 

As I laughed, He Who Listens wept.

“No,” he moaned. “No, no, no. What are you doing? This is *wrong*.”  Tears fell from his great yellow eyes, shining like diamonds under the street lights. Suddenly, I felt guilty. 

“I’m sorry,” I lied. “I didn’t know. I won’t do it again.”

His face broke apart. “You are lying and you don’t even know it. If I show you what we do, you will ruin everything.”

That actually offended me. “Then don’t show me anything. It’s not like I asked.”

“I have no choice,” he sniffled. “I must do what I must do. You will do what you will do. Come.”

He toddled down the street. I hesitated for reasons I still don’t understand. Then I followed.

So did the pigeons.

He Who Listens spun around. “No! They cannot! *They cannot*!”

On my shoulder, Mr. One-Eye beat his wings again, whipping my face. The other pigeons obediently dispersed.

He Who Listens continued to argue with me about Mr. One-Eye, but I held my ground. People say you’re forever responsible for what you tame. I didn’t tame Mr. One-Eye, but I saved him. I think that makes me even more responsible, and I said so.

“Oh no,” he wept. “No. This is wrong. You will be wrong. What am I to do?”

“You are to show me what you’re supposed to show, or leave.”

“I cannot leave. I have no choice.”

“Then let’s get going.”

He wiped tears from his face and flicked them onto the concrete where they spattered like silvery rain.

And as we moved down the street, I saw people who hadn’t been there just a few minutes ago. But they all looked like they’d been there for hours. Languishing in the alleys, spread-eagle on the sidewalks, leaning against buildings as sobs shook their bony shoulders.

As we drew closer, one turned to look at us. Wide yellow eyes glimmered in its round face. A rotting wound glistened under its nose. The flesh of its lips had been eaten to the bone, exposing the teeth.

“Are these…do they listen? Are they all like you?”

“No,” he sobbed. “They’re like you. They did not listen. They answered. They gave too much. They gave what they couldn’t get back.”

We walked in silence after that. I avoided his yellow eyes glistening like coins in the night.

He Who Listens spent all night showing me what to do. Not once, not twice or three times, but twelve.

The first time was a homeless man huddled under a bench in the park. He was sobbing in his sleep, and his face —weathered but unmistakably young — made my heart ache. 

“Sit,” said He Who Listens.

“What if he wakes up?”

“He will not. Sit, and touch him.”

When I laid my hand on that boy, I felt his yammering heartbeat and saw his pain. I heard it. Worse, I felt it. I felt every terrible step in the tragic procession that led him here. Steps that were his fault, and steps that weren’t. It didn’t even matter what was his fault or what wasn’t. All that mattered was his pain.

Even though I could not take that pain from him, his heart slowed the longer I sat there. By the end, its rhythm was calm and steady. Maybe it was my imagination, but I thought his poor weathered face looked a little less sad, too.

“Yes,” He Who Listens said happily. “That is what we do. We listen, and we provide comfort by listening.”

Next we went to a lady sitting in a roach-infested studio apartment, hollow-eyed and expressionless as she stared at her blank television screen.

“Kneel,” said He Who Listens.

“Won't she see me?”

“Not tonight. Kneel, and hold her hand.”

I did as I was told. 

Once again, I heard and saw and felt the most terrible things. Rotting things, things that get inside you and bore tunnels until they kill you. I don’t know how long I sat with her, but I know that by the end her eyes had closed and she was finally sleeping.

We saw a child next, alone and wide awake in a foster home, crying for her father. Then a young mother weeping in her kitchen. An old man in a nursing home, a teenage boy stomping his way down an empty street while tears coursed down his face, a young woman sobbing by herself in a dark office long after everyone around her had gone home. 

It might have been a single night. It might have been a week, or a month, or forever, or ten minutes.

Finally we went to a hospital where a man, balding and exhausted, sat at the bedside of a little girl with sunken eyes and dull, dying skin. I knew she was fading. I knew she would be dead by morning, because when I touched her I felt only the faintest veil of emotion, all of it warm and soft.

So I turned to the father. I didn’t sit this time. I leaned over him the way I used to lean over my son whenever he cried, and wrapped my arms around him.

His pain hit me with the force of a tsunami, repulsive and powerful.

*Help help help help help I can’t lose her she deserves more she’s all I have help her help her help*

The sheer force punched through my heart, wide as a freight train, hot as a bullet, painful as death by acid bath. 

The man cried out. I thought I’d hurt him. I recoiled as he lurched forward, reaching for the child on the bed.

Her eyes were open, and color was returning to her face.

“*What have you done?*” screamed He Who Listens.

I staggered back, gasping as the wound in my chest pulsed and blood dripped down my chest, soaking my dirty shirt. “*You’ve given what you cannot give back! It will consume you!”*

I barely listened. Single-minded purpose filled me and I knew, in the depths of my missing punched-out heart, that I had to get outside, right now.

Somehow, I did. 

The pigeons were waiting for me. An entire flock on the sidewalk, eyes glittering knowingly.

Mr. One-Eye flapped his wings in command. They obeyed, dropping their plucked feathers at my feet. I packed them into my wound. New flesh grew, bright and shimmering as the feathers themselves.

It took longer this time, but that wound healed too.

“No,” wept He Who Listens. “No. You cannot do this. You cannot. You are an abomination.”

I had a vivid mental image of Who He Listens kneeling at my side, stroking my hair, my hands, holding my face as I wept and raged with no knowledge of his presence. 

Again I wondered:

What was the *point* of it?  

“No,” I told him. “The abomination is being able to help people, being able to *do* something, but choosing to do nothing.”

“You are not One Who Listens. You are only a monster.”

“No,” I said. “I’m One Who Listens and Does Something About It.”

He left me and didn’t come back. That was all right. I didn’t need him.

I only needed the pigeons. 

I listened everywhere, to everything and everyone and all their heartbroken, rage-filled, desperate questions. I didn’t answer all of them. I learned that some people don’t need answers. Many don’t even deserve. There are more of those than I ever thought possible.

But some did. I always answered those.

I had no idea what I was. I knew that I was more than I had been. More than myself. And I knew that I was powerful. I even started to wonder if I was a god. Under the circumstances, I think that was a reasonable thing to wonder.

But whether I was a god or not, I could still only be in one place at one time.

That’s why I needed the pigeons.

Pigeons can only be in one place, too. But there are so many of them that they’re already everywhere. 

I asked them to listen. They answered me.

Because they answered me, I was able to answer so many others.

I answered a boy being beaten by cops as a flock of pigeons watched silently from the roofs above. His dog lay beside him, bleeding from bullet holes and panting raggedly. The boy was holding his dog even though the cops kept hitting his hands. He begged for help. He asked for his mother. He told his dog she was a good girl as she whined, blood spreading across the dirty concrete.

Still, they beat him.

So I struck them down.

One cracked open on the sidewalk. I took his gun and shot the other while he stirred feebly. 

The boy looked at me, exhausted and horrified in equal measure, began to pray. I knew he was praying to God, probably to stop me from closer. But I pretended he was praying to me anyway.

I kneeled down and placed my hands on his poor, whining dog.

“Don’t hurt her,” he wept as agony tunneled through my belly, rotten and corrosive and vile. “Please. She’s a good girl.”

“I know,” I told him, then touched his forehead the way I touched my son’s when he’d been running a fever. Another bolt of pain shot through my hand. I saw the wound form this time, watched it cave through my palm and spread.

The dog got to her feet and nuzzled her owner, tail wagging even as she whined.

The boy looked at me, wide-eyed and ashen. “What are you?”

I didn’t know how to answer. To be honest, I didn’t want to.

I hobbled my way out of the alley, down a side street and into a narrow little park. The pigeons followed. Mr. One-Eye gave his wing-flapping, face-slapping order. The feathers came, and with it healing.

The birds kept listening, and I kept answering.

They found a woman, dead-eyed and frozen in fear, huddling as a man with dead eyes bore down on her. I tore his head off. She ran before I could put my hands on her to take away her fear.

They found a flea-bitten baby boy in a sodden, sagging diaper screaming for help in a filthy crib while his parents nodded off in an equally filthy corner. I answered the baby, but I punished them. 

They found a girl in a group home as she slid a blade up and down her arms and asked for someone who should have done everything to protect her but destroyed her instead to die. I answered.

They found an old woman with a black eye pushing an empty cart along broken sidewalks, asking for her belongings to come back. I answered, but not before punishing the thieves.

They found a man sobbing alone in his car, silently pleading for money to feed his kids for the next three days, just the next three days, please God. I answered. My answer was taken from someone else, but it was given.

They found a mother sobbing for help over her son’s blue body, a needle still quivering in his arm. I answered her, too. Afterward I found the man who sold her son the drugs, and then I found the people who sold that man the drugs, and then I found the people who gave *them* the drugs, and those people were no more.

I answered pleas against crime bosses and schoolyard bullies, masked monsters and petty criminals, people who inflicted damage by action and people who inflicted damage by inaction.

Dozens, then hundreds, then more. And more.

And more.

Every answer took from me. I think every answer continued to take. Maybe it’s because I’ve given so many answers and now they all help each other grow. My answers took and took what I can never get back. Even the birds couldn’t give back what I gave. 

But they gave me enough.

Right up until the day your people found me.

That was my fault. God works best in mysterious ways, especially when those ways are small. I am still mysterious, but I forgot to stay small. I will never make that mistake again.

My birds still bring me questions, you know. They’re outside right now. On your walls, your roof, your ground, whispering to each other. Whispering to Mr. One-Eye. Whispering to me.

I hear them, even down here. 

They aren’t perfect. Nobody is. Some questions don’t have answers, and some answers can’t be found.

My son was one of those.

We tried to find him. My pigeons worked as hard as I ever did. Harder, maybe. We couldn’t find him. But my boy, he would understand. My boy, he saw the good in everyone and everything. Wherever he is, he sees the good in us not finding him. Because while looking for him — searching for an answer, any answer at all — we were able to give other people the answers they needed.

You know about those answers. That’s why I’m here.

I love these birds as much as my son ever did, maybe more. I think more. I feel him in them sometimes, or at least I imagine that I do. Holding pigeons, teaching pigeons, loving pigeons, isn’t like having my son back. Nothing will ever be like having him back. But it is the closest thing I have. It is all I have. Sometimes what we have is all we get.

And sometimes, I am the only thing someone gets. Well, me and the birds.

My son knew what he was talking about. These birds are wonderful. They really do think everyone is their friend. They love being held. They love being taught. They love being loved. They love to help.

And they love to listen.

Together, my birds and I are always listening to those who ask for answers. We hear them. Right now, they’re whispering, right this very minute. We hear them, even down here. I hear their pain, and I hear their rage. That’s why you cannot keep me forever, no matter how hard you try:

Because hearing their suffering gives me power, and I still hear every minute of the suffering. 

I hear the children who beg for help.

I hear the fathers who cry for justice

I hear the mothers who demand vengeance

I hear, because I am One Who Listens.

And I help, because I am The One Who Does Something About It.

Ill go first. 
So, I was originally toying with a few options for myself when considering how I would go later in life before settling on what I go by now. 
I had considered options such as. Toby, Able, Etc. All decent and all fair options. 

Until I went on holiday with my family to a major city. We visited a Max Brenner chocolate cafe. 
I have two pretty annoying allergies. 
Chocolate and Coffee. 

I looked around the store at what was for sale. And i saw it. 
Dark roasted Coffee beans coated in Dark Chocolate. Two things i react Badly to. It was called Dark Theo.
And jokingly I had said. ""I should call myself after my enemy ey? Theo"". My sister laughed and started nicknaming me after it. Later on it earnt the whole name ""Theotic"" or Ticky. Due to my vocal stutter when excited. Theo + Tick = Theotic

Eventually. I had come out to my father. 
He recommends legally it be Theon, our family is Irish in heritage and tend to use old family names, with Theon being a common one. 

But I had become named after my enemy, chocolate coffee beans. It feels alright and some folks get a laugh out of hearing why I chose Theo. 

If you have some funny or wholesome renamings, Id love to hear it. Bring some light to the conversation! ",13,1763769780.0,ftm,15,0.93,False

1p3ekcb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p3ekcb,"My Bestie Stole My Man? LOL, She Can Keep the Trash. I Own the Empire Now.","Five years post-divorce, I ran into ex Derek Vaughn at Prada.


I was buying a tie for my husband when he walked in. The sales girl perked right up.


""Mr. Vaughn! Your wife's suit is ready.""


He glanced at the tie in my hand.


""Add hers to my tab.""


I dropped cash on the counter. ""I'm good.""


He sighed like I'd wounded him.


""Sienna... you still hate me after all this time.""


I smiled.


Hate him? Please. I'd moved on.


Funny—he seemed stuck on it.


---


I shoved the bag into my canvas tote—already stuffed with groceries—and headed out.


By the time I made it to the bus stop near Wicker Park, wind had my hair plastered across my face. Couldn't see a thing.


When I finally brushed it away, Derek's car sat right there. Blocking the curb.


He saw my red eyes, frowned.


""Get in. I'll drive you.""


""Nah, I'm good. Bus works.""


He looked me up and down. Paused at my beat-up canvas bag.


Then, real careful—like he thought I'd lose it—


""You been okay? These past few years?""


""Yeah. I'm good.""


He didn't buy it.


""Just let me drive you. Come on.""


The bus behind him kept honking. Yet he didn't move.


Everyone was staring. Whatever. I got in.


""Englewood. Near Garfield and Halsted.""


He went quiet for a second.


Then his voice came out rough.


""You live there? That area's been rough for years. And you're alone, plus...""


He stopped.


I knew what he wanted to say.


That's where my mom died. Ten years ago today, she wouldn't come to my wedding. Went up to the roof—ten stories—and stepped off.


The backseat was roomy but the heat was cranked way too high. I cracked the window.


""You'll get sick. Close it—I'll turn it down.""


I shook my head, half-smiled.


""Not anymore. Do whatever.""


He went quiet. Then his phone rang.


""Babe, you get the clothes? Where are you?""


The voice through the speakers was familiar—but it had this flirty warmth I'd never heard before.


""Yeah, got 'em. Ran into Sienna. Giving her a ride.""


Pause.


""Wait, Sienna's back? Oh my God, it's been forever. Why didn't you tell me? You're hanging out without me?""


I'd known Paige Hartley for over ten years. Never heard her talk like that.


She used to be quiet. Shy. All about her paintings. When some girl stole her spot in a competition, Paige just hid in the bathroom and cried.


I was the one who grabbed a baseball bat and smashed that girl's canvas in front of everyone. Wrote letters exposing the whole rigged system. Spent three days in juvie to get her justice.


Guess it's true—when someone loves you hard enough, you grow a spine.


""It's just a coincidence. She's busy. I'll be home soon.""


""Come on, we ran into each other—that's fate! What's wrong with grabbing dinner with an old friend?""


""Paige. Don't.""


The line went dead.


Derek always knew how to be gentle when he wanted something. But once he made up his mind? No one could change it.


Paige knew that better than anyone.


The call dropped right as we pulled up to my building.


""Thanks.""


I nodded and got out.


He glanced around the rundown complex. Then called after me.


""Sienna... who'd you buy that tie for?""


""My husband.""


He pressed his palm to his forehead, laughed—bitter, broken.


""Same brand. Same style. You bought me these all the time five years ago.""


""So?""


I looked right at him. Didn't blink.


""You don't gotta act tough with me. After everything, I just want you to be okay. Not... like this.""


Like what?


I caught my reflection in the glass door—


Joggers. Hoodie. Sneakers. Canvas bag full of vegetables.


Looked like every other broke twenty-something in Chicago.


But for someone who used to live in Chanel and Cartier? This was just fine.


I smiled. Wasn't even mad.


""I'm okay.""


His face did something weird. Couldn't tell what.


""Sienna... you've changed.""


""Yeah. I know.""


With that, I turned and walked inside. Didn't look back.


I climbed five flights of stairs and unlocked the door.


Everything looked the same as last year. Same peeling wallpaper, same cracked linoleum.


Mom's photo sat next to the ancient TV in a dollar-store frame. The candle in front of her had burned out.


I lit a fresh one, tied on an apron, and went to the kitchen.


Made roast chicken, mashed potatoes, and green beans. Her favorites.


Set a plate across from mine at the table. Empty chair. Untouched food. I barely ate.


""Mom, I ran into Derek today.""


Waited. Like she might actually answer.


""I know, I know. But he can't mess with me anymore. I'm not that girl you remember.""


Nothing but silence.


Lost my appetite. Left everything on the table and went to the bedroom. Pulled an old photo album out from under the bed.


""Let's look at the good pictures, yeah? I'm sick of staring at that funeral portrait.""


Before I could open it, a photo slipped out. Hit the floor.


I picked it up.


Derek. Me. Paige.


Three dumb kids grinning at the camera.


I stood in the middle, arms hooked through theirs, laughing the hardest.


Chapter 2


Back then, debt collectors stormed Derek's place, yelling, threatening to break bones. None of the neighbors helped. Not even my parents.


But I did.


The punch meant for his face landed on mine instead.


Tooth shattered. Face stayed swollen for two weeks.


Mom felt terrible. Told me to stay away from the Vaughns.


But Derek's mom—crippled, broken—dragged herself to our door on her knees. Kept bowing, crying, thanking my parents over and over.


So Mom caved.


For almost ten years after that, there was always an extra plate at dinner for Derek. Every Christmas, we bought him new clothes.


When Mom wasn't working, she'd help Mrs. Vaughn run her street cart. If anyone gave her crap, Mom would tear into them so hard they'd never come back.


They called each other sisters.


But no one expected the quiet, stammering ""little sister"" would end up screwing her ""big sister's"" husband.


When I got home that day, everything was smashed. Plates. Chairs. Picture frames.


Mom stood in the middle of the wreckage, sobbing so hard she couldn't breathe. Red handprint across her cheek—sharp, cruel. Dad stood there with another woman in his arms, holding her tight.


""Let's divorce. You can have everything. I just want Sandra.""


Derek, standing next to me, panicked. Tried to grab Sandra Reeves' hand.


But Mom slapped him. Twice. Hard.


I shoved her back.


She hit the ground. Stared at me like she didn't know who I was.


I was crying too. But what came out was worse than any slap.


""Mom, what gives you the right to hit him?""


Memories tangled, froze on that little photo in my hand.


When Derek and I split, I burned everything. Guess this one slipped through.


Before I could toss the photo, someone knocked.


Thought it was Mrs. Garcia from next door—she always comes by this time of year.


I opened without checking.


Paige Hartley stood there, arm-in-arm with Derek.


She had this big fake smile on.


""Sienna! Oh my God, it's been forever! You haven't changed a bit!""


""I dragged Derek here—hope we're not interrupting?""


I stared at them.


""I'm not letting you in. What do you want?""


Paige's smile wobbled. She looked up at Derek, eyes going all puppy-dog hurt.


""She just wanted to see you. Brought you a gift. That's it.""


With that, Derek set a box on the table by the door. Didn't wait for permission.


Paige jumped in, voice all chirpy.


""This skincare set is my favorite right now. Had an extra at home and thought of you. We used to share stuff all the time, remember?""


I glanced down. Same brand my housekeeper uses.


""That photo...""


Paige's eyes went shiny. Tears building.


""Sienna... you still haven't let go, have you?""


I crumpled the photo in my fist and tossed it in the trash by the door.


""Not really.""


She reached out like she wanted to hold my hand. But stopped halfway.


""Look, I know you're still upset with me. Today would've been your anniversary, right? If you and Derek were still together.""


She waited. I said nothing.


""About what happened... I mean, back then... I didn't have a choice. But if you're really over it, let us buy you dinner. Seriously. If you need anything—money, help, whatever—just tell us. We're old friends, right?""


Was about to say no.


Then the candle by Mom's photo popped. Loud.


I smiled.


""Sure. Why not.""


Paige talked way more than she used to.


And her hands were all over him.


Went on about their trip to Santorini last month while dabbing lip balm on Derek's mouth at a red light.


""Every winter. You always forget till I tell you."" She dabbed at his mouth. ""Last time you kissed me so hard I bled. When are you gonna remember?""


He grabbed her wrist. ""Stop it.""


""Oh shoot—"" She glanced back at me, fake smile plastered on. ""Sorry, Sienna. You're cool with this, right? Derek and I—we're just like this.""


I cut her off.


""I'm fine.""


Beat of silence.


""I walked in on you two before. This is nothing.""


Nobody said anything after that.


The car went silent.


Finally. Peace.


I stared out the window, thinking how shocked Mom would be if she could see how much Lincoln Park had changed.


Back then, Dad was hell-bent on leaving her for Sandra Reeves. Nearly destroyed her.


And when she found out Derek and I got married in secret? That's what killed her.


At first, I only hated Dad and Sandra.


They betrayed Mom. Turned her from this unstoppable force into a paranoid wreck who fell apart over every little thing.


Time drained her faster than anyone else. Sucked the life right out.


Later? I hated myself.


After Mom's funeral, I left. Should've been on my honeymoon. Instead, I went down to Florida alone. Stayed a month.


During that time, I never hated Derek.


Not once.


He was just a kid. Trapped. Born into hell with no way out.


Before I left, I asked Paige to look after him.


She did great. In the apartment Derek and I were supposed to share as newlyweds, she moved around the kitchen like she owned it.


I thanked her. Meant it.


That year, the three of us were closer than ever.


Derek treated me better than he ever had.


Used every cent of his first profit to buy me this gemstone bracelet I'd been eyeing.


On my birthday, lit up fireworks across downtown.


Every month when I got my period, he'd cancel all his meetings and work from home just to be with me.


I never doubted him.


Thought he loved me. Really loved me.


Until I showed up at his office unannounced.


Chapter 3


Behind the half-open door to his private lounge—soft moans. Breathless.


I pushed it open.


Two naked bodies. Tangled together.


Couldn't unsee it.


I screamed.


He moved fast. Shielded the woman under him.


""Who the hell let you in?!""


""GET OUT!""


I grabbed everything I could reach. Hurled it at them.


Lamp. Books. Coffee mug.


Blood trickled down Derek's forehead. He never stopped protecting her.


I smashed everything in that room.


But couldn't make myself go near them.


They used to be the two people I loved most.


Fear sank deep. My teeth chattered. Tried to stay calm.


Paige's face was red, soaked with tears. Wrapped in a sheet, she dropped to her knees.


""Sienna, I'm so sorry.""


""Derek and I... we shouldn't have. But we can't stop. We're in love.""


""Please. Let us be together.""


She looked just like she did years ago—


Cornered in that alley. Crying while those girls circled her.


That same year, I became the school psycho just to protect her. Pissed off the wrong crowd. Couldn't walk certain streets for months.


I was the one who handed her my wedding bouquet.


Told her she'd find her own happiness someday.


But now she was in my husband's arms, begging me to let her keep him.


Tears rolled down my face. Voice came out barely a whisper.


""When did it start?""


Her lips shook. Couldn't say it.


Someone else did.


""Does it matter? You done? This is my office. Not your house.""


""Are you SERIOUS right now?! Derek! Does that mean NOTHING to you?!""


I screamed at him.


He stood there. Naked. Shameless. Eyes cold.


""Fine. You wanna know?""


""March last year. You took off to Florida and left me here. That's when it started.""


""I wasn't trying to hide it. Your mom just died—I didn't wanna hurt you more. So I let you keep pretending we had a marriage.""


""Paige has been through enough. I'm done watching her suffer because of me. Was gonna wait till after your mom's anniversary to ask for a divorce.""


""But since you know now, let's just say it.""


""Divorce me. Take whatever you want. I just want Paige.""


That's when it hit me.


That shove I gave Mom all those years ago—when I picked Derek's side over hers—


It was heavier than I ever knew.


Before the divorce, I made sure to burn it all down first.


Snapped photos of them in bed. Printed hundreds. Passed them out to every single person at his company.


Strung up banners outside his office building. Big block letters: CHEATER. HOMEWRECKER.


Reported Paige to her school for ""misconduct.""


Her college forum exploded. Vicious posts everywhere.


At her graduation, I hired someone to loop videos of the three of us—laughing, smiling, happy—on the big screen in front of everyone.


Every memory I used to treasure became a weapon.


But Derek still protected her.


She graduated from one of the top art schools without a scratch.


Was about to debut her own gallery show.


To keep Paige's dream alive, Derek finally looked me in the eye.


""Her exhibition's about to open. This has nothing to do with us. Don't ruin it.""


I was past reason by then.


""Ruin it? Oh, I've got plenty ready. Everyone at that gallery's gonna love what I prepared.""


He slammed papers on the table in front of me.


""You want your mom's grave left alone? Behave. Sign the papers. Stay away from me and Paige.""


When Mom was buried, I was too wrecked to handle anything. Derek took care of it all—including buying the plot.


Turns out even the dead are dealing with real estate drama now. Plots get bought and sold.


Long as Derek signed one document, Mom wouldn't even rest in peace.


I threw coffee in his face.


That night, I slept at Mom's grave. Cried till I passed out.


Next day, I showed up at the courthouse anyway.


Wasn't what I expected though—Derek only gave me one thing. His family's old house.


""You reported my company for tax fraud. Most of my accounts are frozen. This is all I can give you.""


""If Paige hadn't begged me, you'd get nothing.""


I couldn't win against Derek. Never could.


Not since we were kids.


He was smart. Calculated. Used strategy and power to get what he wanted.


I just charged in headfirst. Hurt everyone around me, including myself.


So I shut up.


Sold the house. But before I left for the Florida, went to Paige's gallery opening one last time.

1p3ehvb,http://pawsability.com,First Christmas Vacation with Service Dog: The Best Moments,"*One family’s story of travel, growth, and finding calm in the chaos.*

I’ll never forget our first Christmas trip with Max, my son’s service dog.

It was supposed to be simple — just a quick flight to visit family, open gifts, and enjoy the season. But in reality? It was a whole mix of nerves, learning, and beautiful surprises I’ll never forget.

When you’re traveling with a child on the autism spectrum and a service dog, even the best-laid plans can go sideways. I packed weeks in advance, made lists, printed every form under the sun, and still worried I’d miss something.

What I didn’t realize then was that the most important thing I needed wasn’t in my bag — it was patience.

#  [**The Airport Adventure**](https://www.holidays.com/traveling-with-a-service-dog-tips-faq/)

The airport that morning was *buzzing* — holiday travelers everywhere, kids in reindeer pajamas, the smell of cinnamon rolls drifting from the bakery. My son covered his ears almost immediately, overwhelmed by the noise.

But Max? Calm as ever.

He guided my son through the crowd, matching his steps perfectly. When TSA asked for paperwork, Max stood steady beside him, quietly watching. My son placed a hand on Max’s back, and I could see the tension melt away.

That moment was my first “we can do this” breath of the day.

We made it through security, found a quiet corner, and sat together — me with coffee in hand, my son softly humming, Max curled at his feet. And for the first time that morning, the chaos around us didn’t matter.

#  [**What We Learned**](https://pawsofability.com/articles/service-pets-children-with-special-needs/the-truth-about-our-first-hotel-stay-with-a-service-dog/)

That trip taught me so much more than I expected:

1. **Preparation matters, but flexibility matters more.** Flights get delayed, relatives run late, plans change — and that’s okay. Having grace for yourself (and your child) makes everything smoother.
2. **Service dogs are truly superheroes.** Max didn’t just help my son navigate — he gave him confidence. Watching my son walk proudly beside his dog through the terminal was the best Christmas gift I could’ve asked for.
3. **Rest is part of the plan.** We learned to build downtime into every part of the trip. Whether it was quiet time in a guest room or a short walk outside, those breaks saved the day.
4. **People notice kindness.** From flight attendants to strangers in line, so many people went out of their way to make things easier. Compassion really does show up when you least expect it.

#  [**Coming Home**](https://pawsofability.com/articles/service-pets-children-with-special-needs/adventure-trust-and-tails-how-travel-strengthened-a-beautiful-friendship/)

When we finally came home, tired but happy, I realized how much we’d grown as a family.

Travel used to terrify me — all the noise, change, and unpredictability. But now, I see it differently. It’s not about reaching a destination. It’s about the moments in between — the smiles, the teamwork, the quiet confidence that comes from knowing we can handle whatever comes next.

This Christmas, I won’t stress about getting everything “just right.” I’ll remember that the best memories aren’t in the perfect photos — they’re in the laughter shared between a boy and his dog at Gate 24B.

Because with love, patience, and a loyal pup by your side, even the busiest holiday season can feel like home.

I ended up staying in town that same night and told her I was going out again and she should meet up with me, which she did. we got very drunk, made out more and then ended up hooking up. towards the end of the hookup she told me she wanted to get to know me and even fly me out to where she lives out of state...i looked at her and was like are u being serious? bc don't tell me that if u don't mean it bc we had already had sex and it felt kinda unnecessary for her to say that. she assured me she meant it and said she wanted to continue to text and get to know me. so i was like ok good bc i also wanted to get to know her more (bc i had felt a spark with her and genuinely liked her, otherwise I wouldn't have done all of this). she flies back home, I didn't hear from her for a week, kinda figured she was busy (also sorta thought she was ignoring me but I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt) so i texted her after the week had gone by and we exchanged a few texts of somewhat misc interest and get to know you questions. she then stopped replying to me after a week or so. we still have each other on insta (she stopped viewing my stories btw) but i'm fully aware she has ghosted me. ghosting isn't anything new but I'm just confused as to why she would tell me she wanted to get to know me after we had already had sex and then proceed to ghost me? I kinda haven't stopped thinking about it. I get that it was a hook up going into it, especially since we live in different states, which I fully was on board with. 



I knew I had a little crush on her but didn't expect anything after until she made that comment about the future. but then for her to ghost me afterwards is just confusing because she didn't need to say it at all if she had no intention of following through. also why keep me on instagram...I have never met someone in a club so Im not sure if this is normal with lesbians or not and if it is then im scared! lol  ",1,1763769397.0,actuallesbians,0,1.0,False

___

A few of me were preparing to make tea, while the others stationed themselves around the facility at some of the different terminals we could not yet work. There was one of me that had come out *wrong*, she was a me, a Marta, but was not *of* me. She had to be told by voice what to do, but she followed verbal commands just fine.

They knocked, and the tea wasn't even done yet. Oh well. One of me let them know, and another came to greet them at the airlock. It hissed as it opened, and a small crowd of people in combat armor came in from the cold. Just inside the door I'd set up a little living room space, a few chairs, a coffee table, I used things from Marta's memories, from before she was me.

""Well howdy folks, I'm Marta, those are also Marta."" I gestured back at the facility where more of mes were. ""Come on in and kick your shoes off... ha! or don't. I won't blame ya for keeping your little suits on.""

The first few stepped inside, ""Breathable air, Ing."" One of them said, and took off her helmet. She was the one we talked to before. I had my closest me walk up to shake her hand and greet her, but she put up a hand to stop me from approaching and all but one of the rest pointed their weapons at me. 

So my me stopped. I didn't want to get it shot.

""I hope you'll forgive me if I don't wish to touch you, until about an hour ago you were a Scourge meat blob.""

""Do we not shake hands to greet? This one remembers doing it often."" I just wanted to make them comfortable. 

""We do... with *people*... people we know are safe to do it with."" She pulled a device off the leg of her suit. A DNA tester. ""We'd all feel a lot more comfortable if you and... all the other Martas could line up in the order you were made to submit some quick genetic samples."" 

""Well, I'm the sixth one, but lets just get mine tested while the rest of my mes line up."" I turned back to shout to the one Marta that wasn't right. ""Come stand at the end of the line Marta!""

The woman looked confused for a moment, but then smiled, ""Number six, got it."" I reached out my hand to touch her device and there was a gentle pricking of my finger for tiny sample. The other's guns never wavered in their aim. When more of us were near, they quick spread their aim. If they wanted to, they could destroy us in an instant. 

The rest of mes lined up and we let them do their little tests on each body we had, even the *off* Marta.

""90%, 90.3, 90.7, 90.9..."" She read the report on our results to her compatriot, Ing, as she'd called him. He had also removed his helmet. ""...93, 93, 93. And this last one is ...99.4. *Fascinating*.""

""Happy now, we Martas mean you no harm. We don't possess enough of the rest to be a threat. We just wanna learn how to work these here machines, darlin'. That's all.""

""Happy enough,"" the woman said. ""Jimantha Jimsonson, nice to meet you Marta."" 

She stuck out a hand to the unlinked Marta, who took it and shook it.

Marta leaned in close and said something to her that I did not hear, and the woman replied, ""Ha! Certainly,"" and patted the unlinked Marta on the arm. 

While I wondered what she said, my closest linked Marta asked. ""Will everyone be having tea?"" 

""Just me and Ingamar,"" Jimantha scared us, the way she smiled when she threatened me. It made all my Martas uncomfortable, ""Everyone else is under strict orders to kill all you Martas immediately if you try to Scourge out on us, or we die, or give the signal.""

""Well heavens, me, we wouldn't want that now would we?"" I tried my winningest smile on my speaking Marta, but it didn't seem to make them feel any more comfortable than her smile had comforted me. 

She walked into my little living room set up there, just inside the airlock, and made herself comfortable. She stepped over the back of one of the chairs, and plopped down into it; after giving it a quick scan, of course.

The first few mes to get tested had gone to collect the tea. ""Do you both like black tea?""

""We do."" She said. Not allowing her male companion to answer for himself. ""But I hope you won't mind we scan the tea first.""

""Not at all. Trust, but verify."" All my Martas smiled, but we noticed our unlinked Marta did not.

We served the tea to our guests, and poured some for many of the Martas as well. Jimantha poked a probe into the teacup, and when she was satisfied with it, she handed the cup to the one called Ingamar.

He sniffed it, blew on it lightly, and took a small sip and slightly scrunched his nose up. ""Not bad, not good either. Bitter, needs a little cream. It's a touch over-steeped. Probably our fault for making them all get scanned while it was steeping.""

""What a gracious guest you are, Ingamar."" One of me went to grab some creamer, ""We do have some cream in the fridge in the break room, if you can wait just a sec, hon, I'll go and grab it."" 

My me with the creamer arrived a moment later and set it down on the table. ""There ya are, sweethearts.""

""Thank you,"" The one called Jimantha replied. She poured a bit into her own tea, then she once again probed it. ""Just cream."" 

""We mean you no harm, we only wish to learn to work these machines."" I tasted the tea with all the Martas that had tea. ""Oh... Ingamar is right. Bitter, and over-steeped. I'm so sorry about that y'all.""

Ingamar put some cream into his tea, and handed the carafe up to the nearest Marta. She went around pouring a touch of cream into each Marta's tea.

""Well, we'd be..."" Jimantha was interrupted by a throat clearing and a sharp look from Ingamar. She corrected herself, ""Ahem, *I'd* be happy to help you learn some more about these machines, but I do have some questions for you first. If you're willing to answer them.""

""We will answer what we can.""

""Are you connected to the rest of the Scourge now?""

""Well... not so immediately, darlin'. We're all too much like you to possess the organs strong enough to contact the whole of us faster than light. We are *we*, here, and the closest rest of us is at the next fire over."" I did not mention that one of us was not a part of our whole.

""I see. Well, that does make me feel more comfortable with the next thing I'm about to ask."" She took a long sip of her tea, ""Oh, that is excellent with the cream in it.""

""That's just great dear, we agree."" My Martas started taking asynchronous sips. The one I'd designated as speaker had no tea. ""Well, what is your next question?"" 

""How do you Martas feel about an exchange student program? I will stay down here to teach you Martas, and one of your Martas will go up to my ship and learn from my engineers."" She smiled the same way as when she threatened us with murder earlier. ""The one I shook hands with earlier, please."" 

""Why that one?""

""Because I shook her hand, and I feel most comfortable with her going up to learn, while I stay here to teach."" 

I did not like the notion of the unlinked Marta being separated from the rest of me, but I could think of no way to excuse a swap that did not seem it would arouse suspicion. ""We are almost ready to agree, but will you be keeping the guns trained on us the whole time?""

""The ones from our ships above? Yes, most certainly. I'll have camera on, which I'm gonna pull off my suit to broadcast the entire time, along with my vital signs. If they drop, this entire building will be erased along with my corpse."" She quaffed the last of her tea and stood back up and started taking off her gloves. ""The marines will leave though, and Ingamar too. I'll stay down here alone.""

Her armor hissed opened after she pressed some buttons on the wrist, and she stepped out of it. 

""Why... are you stripping?"" I asked.

She pulled a camera unit off the chest piece of the armor. ""I got underclothes on that have my vitals trackers built into them. Besides, your Marta is going to need a suit to go outside, right?"" 

""Correct, she will. I am surprised, however, that you are willing to go unarmored and without personal weapons."" 

""I came into this life expecting to go out of it only a few days later. It has been **years**. If it's my time it's my time."" She gestured for the unlinked Marta to step into her vacated suit. I could see that they were roughly the same size now that she was out of the armor. ""Come on the rest of you Martas, show me around. Tell me what you do know, so I know where to start teaching you. *Lucifer* willing, we'll have you all sorted out real soon.""

I left two linked Martas to help the unlinked Marta get the suit on. Ingamar helped ensure the suit was properly sealed when she was inside, and then he put his helmet on and all the humans went out the airlock together with my unlinked Marta. 

Once the rest were gone, a moment later we felt the rumble of their shuttle departing, and almost immediately Jimantha said, ""Uh oh... I think that cream might not be fully agreeing with me, do you have a toilet in the facility?"" 

We did, so we took her to it, where she excused herself into a stall.

She was in there a long time. Marta remembered that sometimes it *can* take a while, so we waited.... and waited... and waited. 

And then, just as were about to walk in and check on her, there was an explosion and a moment later the entire roof of the facility vanished.

I had suspected we shouldn't have trusted them, but I didn't think they'd sacrifice one of their own, for a malformed Marta...

from 7-10pm I was facing off. I managed to do pet food and detergent, tea coffee and toilet roll, frozen and gluten free, my manager had said to give frozen a “quick go” after I had it done I had told the manager that the frozen had not been done the best in comparison to the ones prior. 

She just said that “the pace will pick up” I have been getting compliments from other managers and team leaders on how well I am doing and working harder than most people 

Not too sure how to interpret the comment. Just felt a bit gut wrenching at the time. In my opinion she meant I’m too slow or I’ll get used to it. 

I genuinely feel like I’ve been working hard. Mainly packing out bulk (not sure if that’s a company term for tea coffee/ cereal/biscuits
confectionary/sweets and gluten free

A few of me were preparing to make tea, while the others stationed themselves around the facility at some of the different terminals we could not yet work. There was one of me that had come out *wrong*, she was a me, a Marta, but was not *of* me. She had to be told by voice what to do, but she followed verbal commands just fine.

They knocked, and the tea wasn't even done yet. Oh well. One of me let them know, and another came to greet them at the airlock. It hissed as it opened, and a small crowd of people in combat armor came in from the cold. Just inside the door I'd set up a little living room space, a few chairs, a coffee table, I used things from Marta's memories, from before she was me.

""Well howdy folks, I'm Marta, those are also Marta."" I gestured back at the facility where more of mes were. ""Come on in and kick your shoes off... ha! or don't. I won't blame ya for keeping your little suits on.""

The first few stepped inside, ""Breathable air, Ing."" One of them said, and took off her helmet. She was the one we talked to before. I had my closest me walk up to shake her hand and greet her, but she put up a hand to stop me from approaching and all but one of the rest pointed their weapons at me. 

So my me stopped. I didn't want to get it shot.

""I hope you'll forgive me if I don't wish to touch you, until about an hour ago you were a Scourge meat blob.""

""Do we not shake hands to greet? This one remembers doing it often."" I just wanted to make them comfortable. 

""We do... with *people*... people we know are safe to do it with."" She pulled a device off the leg of her suit. A DNA tester. ""We'd all feel a lot more comfortable if you and... all the other Martas could line up in the order you were made to submit some quick genetic samples."" 

""Well, I'm the sixth one, but lets just get mine tested while the rest of my mes line up."" I turned back to shout to the one Marta that wasn't right. ""Come stand at the end of the line Marta!""

The woman looked confused for a moment, but then smiled, ""Number six, got it."" I reached out my hand to touch her device and there was a gentle pricking of my finger for tiny sample. The other's guns never wavered in their aim. When more of us were near, they quick spread their aim. If they wanted to, they could destroy us in an instant. 

The rest of mes lined up and we let them do their little tests on each body we had, even the *off* Marta.

""90%, 90.3, 90.7, 90.9..."" She read the report on our results to her compatriot, Ing, as she'd called him. He had also removed his helmet. ""...93, 93, 93. And this last one is ...99.4. *Fascinating*.""

""Happy now, we Martas mean you no harm. We don't possess enough of the rest to be a threat. We just wanna learn how to work these here machines, darlin'. That's all.""

""Happy enough,"" the woman said. ""Jimantha Jimsonson, nice to meet you Marta."" 

She stuck out a hand to the unlinked Marta, who took it and shook it.

Marta leaned in close and said something to her that I did not hear, and the woman replied, ""Ha! Certainly,"" and patted the unlinked Marta on the arm. 

While I wondered what she said, my closest linked Marta asked. ""Will everyone be having tea?"" 

""Just me and Ingamar,"" Jimantha scared us, the way she smiled when she threatened me. It made all my Martas uncomfortable, ""Everyone else is under strict orders to kill all you Martas immediately if you try to Scourge out on us, or we die, or give the signal.""

""Well heavens, me, we wouldn't want that now would we?"" I tried my winningest smile on my speaking Marta, but it didn't seem to make them feel any more comfortable than her smile had comforted me. 

She walked into my little living room set up there, just inside the airlock, and made herself comfortable. She stepped over the back of one of the chairs, and plopped down into it; after giving it a quick scan, of course.

The first few mes to get tested had gone to collect the tea. ""Do you both like black tea?""

""We do."" She said. Not allowing her male companion to answer for himself. ""But I hope you won't mind we scan the tea first.""

""Not at all. Trust, but verify."" All my Martas smiled, but we noticed our unlinked Marta did not.

We served the tea to our guests, and poured some for many of the Martas as well. Jimantha poked a probe into the teacup, and when she was satisfied with it, she handed the cup to the one called Ingamar.

He sniffed it, blew on it lightly, and took a small sip and slightly scrunched his nose up. ""Not bad, not good either. Bitter, needs a little cream. It's a touch over-steeped. Probably our fault for making them all get scanned while it was steeping.""

""What a gracious guest you are, Ingamar."" One of me went to grab some creamer, ""We do have some cream in the fridge in the break room, if you can wait just a sec, hon, I'll go and grab it."" 

My me with the creamer arrived a moment later and set it down on the table. ""There ya are, sweethearts.""

""Thank you,"" The one called Jimantha replied. She poured a bit into her own tea, then she once again probed it. ""Just cream."" 

""We mean you no harm, we only wish to learn to work these machines."" I tasted the tea with all the Martas that had tea. ""Oh... Ingamar is right. Bitter, and over-steeped. I'm so sorry about that y'all.""

Ingamar put some cream into his tea, and handed the carafe up to the nearest Marta. She went around pouring a touch of cream into each Marta's tea.

""Well, we'd be..."" Jimantha was interrupted by a throat clearing and a sharp look from Ingamar. She corrected herself, ""Ahem, *I'd* be happy to help you learn some more about these machines, but I do have some questions for you first. If you're willing to answer them.""

""We will answer what we can.""

""Are you connected to the rest of the Scourge now?""

""Well... not so immediately, darlin'. We're all too much like you to possess the organs strong enough to contact the whole of us faster than light. We are *we*, here, and the closest rest of us is at the next fire over."" I did not mention that one of us was not a part of our whole.

""I see. Well, that does make me feel more comfortable with the next thing I'm about to ask."" She took a long sip of her tea, ""Oh, that is excellent with the cream in it.""

""That's just great dear, we agree."" My Martas started taking asynchronous sips. The one I'd designated as speaker had no tea. ""Well, what is your next question?"" 

""How do you Martas feel about an exchange student program? I will stay down here to teach you Martas, and one of your Martas will go up to my ship and learn from my engineers."" She smiled the same way as when she threatened us with murder earlier. ""The one I shook hands with earlier, please."" 

""Why that one?""

""Because I shook her hand, and I feel most comfortable with her going up to learn, while I stay here to teach."" 

I did not like the notion of the unlinked Marta being separated from the rest of me, but I could think of no way to excuse a swap that did not seem it would arouse suspicion. ""We are almost ready to agree, but will you be keeping the guns trained on us the whole time?""

""The ones from our ships above? Yes, most certainly. I'll have camera on, which I'm gonna pull off my suit to broadcast the entire time, along with my vital signs. If they drop, this entire building will be erased along with my corpse."" She quaffed the last of her tea and stood back up and started taking off her gloves. ""The marines will leave though, and Ingamar too. I'll stay down here alone.""

Her armor hissed opened after she pressed some buttons on the wrist, and she stepped out of it. 

""Why... are you stripping?"" I asked.

She pulled a camera unit off the chest piece of the armor. ""I got underclothes on that have my vitals trackers built into them. Besides, your Marta is going to need a suit to go outside, right?"" 

""Correct, she will. I am surprised, however, that you are willing to go unarmored and without personal weapons."" 

""I came into this life expecting to go out of it only a few days later. It has been **years**. If it's my time it's my time."" She gestured for the unlinked Marta to step into her vacated suit. I could see that they were roughly the same size now that she was out of the armor. ""Come on the rest of you Martas, show me around. Tell me what you do know, so I know where to start teaching you. *Lucifer* willing, we'll have you all sorted out real soon.""

I left two linked Martas to help the unlinked Marta get the suit on. Ingamar helped ensure the suit was properly sealed when she was inside, and then he put his helmet on and all the humans went out the airlock together with my unlinked Marta.

1p3e8h0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimNoFap/comments/1p3e8h0/porn_makes_you_anxious_depressed_here_is_what_to/,Porn makes you Anxious & Depressed… Here is what to do about it.,"# Short term impact - Below Baseline Dopamine

The thing about porn consumption is that: Yes, it does release large quantities of dopamine into your system, and it does make you feel good in the short term. For a brief moment, all your troubles seem to fade away.

However, each time you get this massive hit of dopamine from porn, it is well above your baseline levels of dopamine, and once you are done watching it, your dopamine levels don’t just return back to the baseline again, they actually fall well below baseline level. In short, you feel worse than you felt before you actually indulged in watching porn.

# Long term impact - Desensitization

Additionally, in the long term, the neurological impact of chronic overstimulation is devastating. It leads to reduced activity in the brain's natural reward centers. This creates a state called ""anhedonia,"" where previously enjoyable activities lose their appeal because they can't compete with artificial stimulation levels.

This sort of desensitization effect compounds the problem, requiring even more intense stimulation to achieve the same dopamine response. What began as an occasional session of watching ‘vanilla’ porn for a few minutes, has now evolved into browsing ‘absurd fetishes’ for hours.

# Solution

The good news is that: you can go from a person with a disrupted reward system back to person with a normal healthy reward system. Natural dopamine regulation depends on maintaining appropriate baseline levels whilst preserving the system's ability to respond to genuinely rewarding experiences.

This requires both eliminating artificial overstimulation (in the form of porn, weed, alcohol, fast food etc.) and actively supporting healthy dopamine production and receptor sensitivity through lifestyle interventions. In this post, I am going to discuss a few of these lifestyle interventions that you can start applying to your life and heal your depressed and anxious brain.

# Intervention 1: Get your workouts in.

This intervention is going to sound very cliche, but the truth is that it is incredibly effective and this post would be incomplete without it. This effective protocol is “exercise”. When most people think about exercise, they tend to think about how exercise alters their outwardly appearance: you get leaner, you grow muscles etc. However, there is much more that is happening internally when you exercise. Exercise provides one of the most powerful natural dopamine interventions available.

Moderate aerobic activity, things like going for a slow-paced jog, or cycling at steady pace, or brisk walking, they increase dopamine production for several hours post-exercise, whilst simultaneously improving receptor sensitivity and reducing tolerance to artificial stimulation.

Additionally, High-intensity exercise, such as High Intensity Interval Training or HIIT workouts, have been specifically linked to increases in dopamine receptor density and dopamine transporter function.

What I would recommend is that you create an exercise regimen for yourself that incorporates a bit of both. Slow paced aerobic activities & HIIT, this way you are going to get the best out of both worlds. You can get all these benefits by scheduling 3 - 4 such workouts in a week.

# Intervention 2: Get your sleep in.

This intervention, too, is going to sound quite cliche, yet it is just another very powerful tool to have in your tool kit. This is your “sleep quality”.

Sleep quality has a profound impact on dopamine function, with research showing that optimal sleep can restore dopamine receptor sensitivity by approximately 15-25% overnight. Specifically, studies in animal models demonstrate that sleep deprivation significantly reduces dopamine D1 receptor density by around 15%, while recovery sleep can increase dopamine D2 receptor density by about 25%, indicating receptor sensitivity restoration during sleep.

There are several stages to your sleep. The deep sleep stages facilitate the clearance of metabolic waste products that interfere with neurotransmitter function, whilst REM (Rapid eye movement) sleep consolidates the neural pathways that support healthy reward processing.

There is bunch of other research done on sleep quality and how it impact your memory, your impulse control, your perception of things. Sleep quality, quite literally, plays a major role in every single bodily function that you have. It is absolutely essential for healing your reward system and building the impulse control to overcome porn addiction.

What I would recommend is that, the most important thing you could do to improve your sleep quality is fix a bed time and then go to bed at that same time every single day, including the weekends. There are numerous studies that show irregular sleeping patterns mess up your circadian rhythm, hormone secretion, your mood, your energy levels etc.

My second recommendation for sleep quality would be to get plenty of sunlight especially during the earlier parts of the day. Sunlight exposure, especially in the morning, is strongly associated with improved sleep quality by regulating the body's internal clock (circadian rhythm) and enhancing melatonin and serotonin production. Serotonin, a neurotransmitter that positively affects mood and melatonin is the hormone that induces and maintains sleep at night. Daytime exposure to sunlight also leads you to fall asleep earlier, have longer sleep duration, and better sleep quality compared to minimal sun exposure.

# Intervention 3: Get your cold showers in.

Immersion in cold water (as little as 1–3 minutes) has been shown in studies to elevate dopamine output by up to 250%, with long lasting effects on mood and energy.

Additionally, enhanced alertness and a reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression have been reported following regular cold-water immersion or cold showers. Lastly, cold immersion releases other ""feel-good"" chemicals, such as beta-endorphin and norepinephrine, alongside dopamine, which further contributes to the mental health benefits.

In short, cold showers are like natures antidepressants and they should be part of your routine, especially if you are trying to avoid porn and you are facing void of pleasure in your life. What I would recommend is that you get a total of around 11 minutes per week of deliberate cold exposure, broken into sessions of 1 to 5 minutes each. So, you could be doing like 4 cold showers a week, each of the showers is 3 minutes long and that gives you 12 minutes of cold exposure.

Also, if you are feeling brave ;), I recommend taking the cold shower first thing in the morning. It works better than coffee, in my opinion, and just gets you fired up for the day.

# Intervention 4: Get your meditation in.

Meditation is associated with increased gray matter volume (GMV) in brain regions related to self-awareness, emotional regulation, and reward processing, such as the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex etc. I am of the opinion that your salah, when offered with deep concentration, might offer similar benefits.

Long-term meditation enhances neuroplasticity, which is the brains ability to rewire itself, and this is crucial in restoring your brain back to its factory settings and undoing the damage caused by porn. Additionally, meditation promotes neurogenesis (the creation of new brain cells), particularly in the hippocampus where our memories are stored.

In some sense, meditation is being in the complete opposite state than you are when you watch porn. When you watch porn, you are in a hyper stimulated state. When you meditate, you are deprived off all nearly all stimulation. This is probably why it has such a positive healing effect on your brain. Porn rewires your brain and makes you impulsive and out of control. Whereas meditation rewires you brain and get you feeling like you are in control. Porn erodes gray matter, whereas meditation helps in the creation of new cells.

There are various form of meditation practices that are available, each offer different benefits, what I would recommend is that you start making one of these practices as part of your daily routine. Start with a very little amount, just a couple of minutes and the gradually increase the duration of your practice over time.

Part 1- Hayato Kawajiri

Scrambled eggs, sausages, green beans and a flask of orange juice. A very normal Kawajiri breakfast. But this was not a normal Kawajiri morning, Hayato solely knew. For there was a viper in the nest, and it wore his father’s skin.

The man emulating the corpse of Kosaku Kawajiri was dressed in his standard working attire- plain white suit, striped shirt and green tie plastered with cats, for that smidge of personal flair. Perfectly responsible for a middle-class salesman. Not of a rampant serial killer, with a tendency for identity theft and rapid combustion of his victims’ corpses. That murderer lies in my father’s skin. I will get rid of him by midday. I know, big talk for an eleven year old.

Morioucho Radio had just begun playing Jamiroquai when that man drank his coffee. He seemed different- his hair was slicked back, white bristles as pale as the moon spread sparsely through his usually black spikes. His customarily sour frown was replaced by a cheery demeanour unfamiliar to Hayato- snow-white teeth prying from a jolly smile, voice humming through Virtual Insanity’s chorus smoother than honey. His confidence unnerved the boy more than anything- what is this serpent planning? 

A crash awoke Hayato from his thoughts. On his left, lay his mother’s favourite china teapot, shattered beyond repair. She sat huddled over it, teeth gritted in remorse.

“Damnitt Hayato!” she bellowed. “Why won’t you just listen to me for once! I was asking you to carry the teapot!” Looking back, Hayato did remember a distinct speaking sound from his mother’s mouth, but he was focused on bigger fish. 

He stuttered on his apologies, which his mother didn’t take well. “You don’t even care, do you?”

And then, the viper came slithering.

The man positioned himself behind his mother, and took a hand to her neck. “Oh dear Shinobu. It was only a tea set, don’t worry. I’ll get a new one.” His elaborate language was also new, replacing the soft grunts once echoed. Shinobu buried her face in his chest, and he kissed her on the forehead, all the while his violet eyes smeared over his supposed son. He smirked. He knew he had won the game. For now.

“Well,” Shinobu spoke, wiping her eyes. “You boys should be off. It’s almost past 20.”

The man admired his watch. The watch he stole from Hayato’s father. “Seems so. Come, Hayato. Let’s walk.”

“Wait, Kosaku. You have tea on your shirt.” A splodge of tea lay at the foot of his suit.

“It's fine honey. I'll get it changed later. Hayato, let’s move!” I thought the tea pot was empty.

By 8:20, the Kawajiri boys were out the door, and on the streets of Morioh. The man strutted with slick confidence, while Hayato walked meekly beside him.

“I’m feeling refreshed.” the man said. “I’m feeling new. I’m sure you can tell. You like the hair? I think it’s a bit much. I preferred my old head of hair to your father’s.”

“Then go back. Leave us.”

“No can do, little Hayato. You know my secret.”

“I’ll tell everyone if you don’t.”

“I fear that’s out of the question. You see, I developed something after our talk in the shower last night.”

“And what would that be?”

“Immortality. Inevitably. Immunity. Invincibility. A variety of I-related attributes.”

“How's that?”

“I suppose you’ll find out. Tell Rohan, Yoshikage Kira said hi. And keep your eyes on your watch.”

With that, Yoshikage Kira walked into the distance, and left Hayato on the pavement, at exactly 8:21. Yoshikage Kira. I must remember that name. And who the hell is Rohan?

The morning was cold and crisp, and Hayato had forgotten his coat. He envied the man leaning on his car a few paces ahead, wrapped in a green overcoat and matching gloves. He also envied the man’s pristine abs poking out his tank top, and his stylish brown boot-pants far outmatched Hayato’s awkward wellies. His raven hair was swooped to one side, held up by a pretentious headband with two heavy earrings reaching his chin. That’s one bizarre outfit, Hayato remarked, as he passed the slender onlooker. Hayato checked his watch. 8:22.

The man slapped his phone while Hayato passed. “Damn that Josuke. Wake up!” he muttered, before laying eyes on Hayato. “Excuse me, are you Hayato Kawajiri? I’m Kishibe Rohan,” he asked. Hayato ignored him, fearing Kira’s warning. But in an instant, he crumbled to the ground, his face opening like a book. He found himself completely immobile- skin slowly molding into paper.

“HEAVEN’S DOOR!” Rohan cried, and turned Hayato onto his back.  He began frantically turning the pages that once resembled his skin, Hayato unable to stop him.

“Hayato. Aged 11. Mother, Shinobu, Alive. Father, Kosasku, Deceased?” How is this man reading my life? Is he like Kira? Rohan turned more pages. 8:23.

“An old man with his zipper undone will pass by in 4 seconds.” Rohan read aloud. Hayato, pinned against Rohan’s car, saw as  predicted, an old man wandering by, blissfully unaware of his undone fly.

“He will sneeze in 2 seconds.” The man sneezed and spluttered.

“A group of teenage girls will laugh at him in 3.” The girls snorted at his disposition. What has Kira done to me?

Rohan raised his perfectly-groomed eyebrows, and turned another page. “I don’t know if you can hear me, Hayato Kawajiri.” 10 seconds till 24. “Your father is not who you think he is.” 5, 4, 3, “Yoshikage Kira, I’ve-

“KILLER QUEEN, BITES THE DUST!” radiated Kira’s voice. Rohan stumbled back, back erupting in blood as Hayato sat helpless. He gasped, more explosions tearing through his flesh and bone, cracking and rupturing and ripping, until he was dead. Kira stood behind him, gleaming, as Hayato rose from his spell.

“This has happened a thousand times, Hayato. And it will happen a thousand more. You doom anyone who dares find out who I am.”

The sky turned purple. Houses evaporated into a whirlpool. A time loop. Hayato chucked Rohan’s earring at the killer, before he himself was lost to time.",1,1763768248.0,wholesomejojo,1,1.0,False

Just finished week one! \[Insert happy dance\]. I took my first shot last Friday at 5:30 pm. Around 2am, I got extreme nausea but was able to sleep through it and woke up feeling fine. Both food noise and hunger was suppressed. When I would eat, I would feel SUPER full after a few bites, even when I only had coffee with a 1/2 scoop of protein powder. I would be STUFFED for hours. I was more prone to this in the mornings, but could eat more freely in the evenings. I also am prone to not pooping so I immediately started taking Miralax daily and Dulcolax as needed. My goal was to prioritize protein, fiber, and hydration. I also met with a personal trainer, but I’m not ready for that quite yet, lol.

Unfortunately, it seems like **my body metabolizes the medicine quickly** because by Monday evening, I could slowly feel it starting to wear off for two hours. Each night, the wearing off period got longer. I was steadily losing weight, but by Wed I gained .2 lbs even though I didn’t eat that much, and on Thu I gained another .2 lbs. But now that I know how my body responds to it, I can try to adjust. Overall, I’m still down 5.4 lbs. Has anyone else experienced this?

The biggest surprise was how it affected my **sleep apnea**. I specifically chose Zebpound because it’s supposed to help with this. The three months prior to starting, I would stop breathing in my sleep MULTIPLE times a night. I would wake up violently gasping for air. From the very first night I took it, I have not had any more issues *at all*. I literally could cry. I didn’t expect it to work so quickly or effectively. I am still shocked. It is worth the cost for that alone! 

Ok, that’s my journey thus far. Let me know if you experienced anything similar or if you started near the same weight as me or at the same time. I love reading everybody’s stories! Excited to see what this week brings. It’s also my birthday week, so yay to me starting off my new year healthier. ",7,1763767840.0,Zepbound,12,1.0,False

1p3du71,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mounjaro/comments/1p3du71/3_meals_a_day/,3 Meals a Day?,"Being on Mounjaro around 16ish months I've gain a lot of insight into what my body needs in terms of calorie content daily. I'll make it more simple and call its meals because I think for me I think in those terms and maybe you do too. **Three meals a day is too much food.**

All my life it's been drilled into my head the food pyramid and three meals a day. Regardless of what the modern science is and what people believe, it's almost like a ritual. There's peer pressure from all sides of my life that that's what it's supposed to be. I'm not saying it's wrong or right but for me - its hasn't worked traditionally in terms of being a healthy weight.

Fast foward to today and being down 95 lbs and around 30-40 lbs of my ideal weight - 3 meals a day is never a good idea, for me at least.

At this stage of my journey, I'm around 239-241 lbs and have been for a few weeks. The last 20 lbs has been slow to lose, but it's happening. Most of my days have been 3 meals, albeit some small and maybe, maybe one normal sized one. The realization: at my level of activity and my life, this is what I should be eating (or less). **The three meals a day has been the biggest contributor to my weight problems.**

I'm not physically active, that's another big part of my problems historically. I'm not blaming it all on 3 meals a day - we all know that the story is never a simple one. But I've always joked that when I was single I was trim, and when I was in a relationship I was overweight. But the correlation between all of the above - for me at least - is that when I eat when I want to, I tend to eat way less. The pressure to eat with my family or to be a part of a ritual where my day revolves around breakfast, lunch, and dinner isn't what I'm made for.

Again this is just me and my perspective. I ain't no doctor, nutritionist, or anything like that.   


* Having a bite of something in the morning, if I'm hungry works for me. If not, maybe it's just a coffee, tea, or protein shake. Sometimes, it's just plain water.
* Lunch is something I enjoy but if I'm still not feeling it, I'll have a snack. But I let my energy needs and my body tell me what I need to do (I don't really have hunger per se but low energy). 
* Dinner is sometimes just a snack or small small plate of something. Especially if I ate a full or normal size lunch. If I just snacked at lunch, dinner may be something more substantial.
* It sometimes sucks to be at the table and not eating something or not be with the family at all. But food shouldn't be the reason for you to spend time with your family - I do it because I want to be with them/love them. Not because of some mandated feeding time. 

Some of the above may sound harsh but let me assure you, I will still nibble at a family meal or taste what's offered. But that's about it. Not eating a whole plate 3 times a day? That works great for me and I'm hoping that once I hit my maintenance stage, I'm still doing great with it.

Here's some of my recent meals (see below). I never eat more than half, usually it's about 1/4 of what's put in front of me. I don't care about ""eating my money's worth"" or hurting the restaurants feelings, or someone that cooked it. Sometimes I feel bad about wasting food if my kids don't eat the leftovers but honestly? I'm not sorry at all.

1p3dsfc,https://i.redd.it/6qps0cqi2p2g1.jpeg,Appreciation post - Genuine thank you to monopoly!,"After using some and gifting some, I saved my favourite coupon, coffee for tomorrow morning and that’s it. Goodbye monopoly, you will be missed!

I do visit McDonalds from time to time, just a broke college student mostly there for cheap eats and caffeine ($1 large coffee omg please keep it there forever). That said, I am always on survival mode and go for the cheap things. There are things that I don’t see myself trying without monopoly because they are considered luxury for me.

The steak cheese & egg biscuits are sooo good! I never ever considered getting them because they are just the most expensive on the biscuit menu. Dang they are so good and filling. Also thanks to this sub I knew about round egg and it is a game changer. So thank you mcd and redditors.

I got one small fries, and all other times I went with the cone or apple pie. The ice cream is so creamy and not overly sweet. And the apple pie is awesome especially when I heat it up at home and enjoy while warm. Due to budgets and being more health conscious, I don’t even think about buying myself sweet treats. So I really enjoyed them.

I didn’t have much luck with getting the Mcflurry/cookies one but at least I got to try the cookies. They are surprisingly good especially when they are still warm. I don’t know how they do it but it is just perfectly soft and gooey for me.

I have never had a snack wrap, and they are delicious, plus good enough as a meal for me just by themselves (same for double cheeseburger, which is filling for even longer). I love getting the spicy one with light sauce, it never fails to be so satisfying.

I am still physically active so I didn’t gain a lot of weight but I definitely got a tummy and experiencing less energy, constipation, now have a sugar craving to fix etc. all the good stuff. But I’d say all the free food is well worth it. I didn’t find out about the monopoly game until mid-October, but still, I spent $70-80 less on my usual grocery budget this month and that is a HUGE win for me.

Lastly, thank you all the Mcdonalds employees for your hard work. I’ve worked in food service before and events like this must drive you all crazy. I try to redeem only 1-2 per visit and the staff in my local mcdonalds are always so kind and fast. 

Thank you McDonalds. I wasn’t even playing for the big prizes. I was just here for the free food and I genuinely appreciated everything!",6,1763767566.0,McDonalds,1,0.87,False

1p3drvi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p3drvi,The Bitter End (Espresso Martini riff),"Background: I drink coffee every morning. I use a Chemex and I really like the Honduran whole beans from Aldi. I usually only drink one of the the two cups made from the Chemex. The other cup, I sometimes save in a mason jar and toss it in the fridge for iced coffee and for espresso martinis. I also started taking that second cup and pouring it in an ice cube tray to make coffee ice. I prefer two teaspoons dem in my coffee, so I throw the same in the second cup for both the mason jar and the ice cubes. 

Recipe: 
2 oz (60ml) Vodka of choice
1/2 oz (15ml) Kahlua (or other coffee liqueur)
1/2 oz (15ml) Maple Syrup (or other simple of choice)
2 oz (60 ml) Coffee from the mason jar in the fridge (or whatever coffee concentrate you typically use in your other espresso martinis)

Process:
- Throw all ingredients in a shaker. 
- Secret #1: use the coffee ice cubes from the freezer to shake until cold and frothy. I’ll use about 10-15 cubes and shake to almost full dilution. 
- Secret #2: take another 15-20 cubes and toss em in a double rocks or Mai Tai glass. 
- Single strain the contents of the shaker over the cubes in the glass. 
- Voila! 

My fav part of this cocktail is how absolute COFFEE taste it maintains throughout the whole drink, thanks to the ice. Stays cold without being watered down either in the shake or as it’s being downed the hatch. 

I also like starting a long night with one of these, cause it seems to keep me awake through the rest of my cocktail-night-journey 🤣☕️🥳

Feel free to modify as you see fit! A buddy prefers to split the vodka with a crème liqueur to cut the strong coffee flavor. Not my preference, but I get it. Something for everyone. 

Enjoy, my friends. Stay thirsty. Stay strong. ",1,1763767524.0,cocktails,0,0.55,False
1p3drqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1p3drqx/im_not_sure_what_to_do_anymore/,I'm not sure what to do anymore.,"I started college August 25th, and I've spend 3k on it plus 5k in federal student loans. Yes, that's cheap for a college in the US, but I'm 19 and have no financial help beside my part time job and my parents allowing me to stay with them until I graduate. I was doing so good at first on getting school work done throughout the weekdays, but as of this past weekend I've lost any and all motivation to do absolutely anything. I've been struggling with depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation for 5 & 1/2 years, and I'm honestly surprised I've made it this far. I'm not sure how much longer I'll last. I recently changed one of my 4 medications, and my mood has greatly dropped. I almost cried in front of my coworker (who also happens to be one of my dad's friends who I've known most my life) yesterday, and I've been avoiding talking to family for weeks now. My room is a pigsty, and I haven't been eating much. I have a missing 4-5 paged essay that I haven't even started on, and I don't have any motivation or plan to work on it anytime soon. I've been trying to go to my local coffee shop to do work on my days off, but even sitting in here now, I am not getting anything done, and I'm instead writing this. I'm afraid of what else I'll do to myself if I go back home and stay alone in my room. My parents have been degrading me for my ""mood"" and for staying in my room all night, even though they are aware of what I struggle with. I'm so anxious over my school work and over what my dad's friend thinks of me now that I nearly broke down in front of him even though we've also talked abt my mental health a few times before. idk. I'm just so exhausted. My psychiatrist recommended I go to community north, a somewhat local mental hospital, when I called and told her about my medication not working yesterday. This is not the first time a medical professional has recommended a mental facility for me. I've tried just about every option available to help with my depression that I can afford, (therapy, psychiatry, medication) but nothing has worked.

TLDR: I'm scared of what I'll do to myself, and I'm not sure what to do anymore. I'm exhausted and isolated and I'm not sure how much more I can take.

Please let me know if you have gone through anything similar and if you have any recommendations for me. I don't want to be like this forever until I die. I appreciate any and all help or even just a simple read of my post. thank you",2,1763767513.0,SuicideWatch,0,1.0,False

I almost cried in front of my coworker (who also happens to be one of my dad's friends who I've known most my life) yesterday, and I've been avoiding talking to family for weeks now. My room is a pigsty, and I haven't been eating much. I have a missing 4-5 paged essay that I haven't even started on, and I don't have any motivation or plan to work on it anytime soon. I've been trying to go to my local coffee shop to do work on my days off, but even sitting in here now, I am not getting anything done, and I'm instead writing this. I'm afraid of what else I'll do to myself if I go back home and stay alone in my room. My parents have been degrading me for my ""mood"" and for staying in my room all night, even though they are aware of what I struggle with. I'm so anxious over my school work and over what my dad's friend thinks of me now that I nearly broke down in front of him even though we've also talked abt my mental health a few times before. idk. I'm just so exhausted. My psychiatrist recommended I go to community north, a somewhat local mental hospital, when I called and told her about my medication not working yesterday. This is not the first time a medical professional has recommended a mental facility for me. I've tried just about every option available to help with my depression that I can afford, (therapy, psychiatry, medication) but nothing has worked.

TLDR: I'm scared of what I'll do to myself, and I'm not sure what to do anymore. I'm exhausted and isolated and I'm not sure how much more I can take.

Please let me know if you have gone through anything similar and if you have any recommendations for me. I don't want to be like this forever until I die. I appreciate any and all help or even just a simple read of my post. thank you",1,1763767429.0,depression,0,1.0,False

You typically reply when I do, but you never make any effort to initiate, even after I told you how that made me feel. So I've just about given up trying. 

I contemplated texting you, to tell you that I'm moving, that I got a tax license to start a small business, and that the coffee place we talked about kinda sucked. But I'm honestly not sure if it would be welcome or an intrusion at this point. If you saw my name in your notifications, would you be excited? Or roll your eyes and swipe it away? Because I don't want to be that person in your life. If it's the latter, I'd rather we just called it, wished each other well, and went out separate ways.

I’m a few days short of 2 years with my mechanical heart valve (how time flies when you’re living life again). I had an echo back in June which was all positive, also had 24 hour ECG and blood pressure monitor around the same time, both were good with no issues identified. I have my annual face to face review with my cardiologist in 2 weeks. I’m on warfarin and candesartan 4mg (lowest dose you can get for this medication).

One thing since my surgery I have noticed is I get these dizzy spells that I would probably describe as more pre fainting spells that disappear as soon as I sit down. When I strikes I feel like I’m about to just collapse with sudden dizzy/unsteady feeling. This resulted in the 24 hour monitors I had in June. The last time I had an episode was back in March/April I was weeding the garden then all of a sudden I felt like I was falling over to one side, I quickly sat down and it passed.

Fast forward to last weekend I went out for a run in the morning, came home had a coffee got showered then was standing cooking lunch and all of a sudden it hit me again. I felt like I was about to collapse I managed to get to my sofa and as soon as I sat down I was completely fine.

Now this would probably be the 3rd or 4th episode in a year. All seem to happen around the same time of day which I worked out would be 3ish hours after I take my BP medication. My theory is that under certain conditions my blood pressure is dropping very rapidly causing me to feel like this and it’s not heart arrhythmia. It’s scary when it happens and it’s only started post surgery. Maybe happened 3/4 times the first year too.

I’m hoping someone else has maybe experienced this to give some reassurance it is blood pressure medication related? I plan on discussing with my doctor but I felt like he dismissed this earlier in the year when it happened.",2,1763767213.0,valvereplacement,1,1.0,False

1p3dmdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1p3dmdq/sharing_my_story_on_workplace_harrassment/,Sharing my story on workplace harrassment,"Im sharing this hoping to gain some solidarity with every woman who has experienced anything like this. It took me one month to report it to but I finally did and it looks like the guy is going to get fired for it. Im hoping he does. 

Here is my story: 

On my first day in office about a month ago, we were told to meet in the lobby and that we'd be brought up together. I entered the lobby and the first person there was this weird looking creepy guy named Chris. I introduced myself and it was clear immediately that he was a very socially awkward person. He seemed to lack social skills and I just didnt trust him immediately, it was like a gut feeling that I knew something was off about this man. He is a short bald white man who dresses really weirdly and just yeah is super socially awkward. He just gave off this certain kind of cringey vibe. 

After that day he started saying good morning/hi to me all the time, sometimes multiple times a day. Sometimes he would even goout of his way or purposely try to catch my eye to interact. 

At first I thought it was just niceities because sure you say hi to people when you pass them in the hallway. But what i noticed is he would smille this really BIG creepy smile everytime he saw me and go out of his way to say hi to me. When we first had our desks assigned, i sat a few desks behind him. I would go back and forth and each time i passed his desk he would try to make eye contact with me and say hi. It started making me feel uncomfortable so i tried to just avoid making eye contact at all with him, even turning my head or looking at my phone. He would still be like ""hi name"" and force me to acknowledge him and smile even when i didnt want to.

Then I made a horrible horrible mistake one day. I was nice to him. One day about 2 weeks into being in office, the office catered lunch. I hadn't made any friends or even aquaintances yet and saw people were sitting in the micromarket cafe area and eating togehter. I saw one coworker, ,who was the girl who sits in front of me. She was sitting with Chris, and I wanted to introduce myself to HER and maybe just break the ice. I thought maybe with Chris too maybe it just feels awkward because we havent broken the ice much yet beyond hi/hello.

So i sat down and we chatted a bit and had lunch together. A few days prior to this, I had asked my manager if i could move desks to be near a window and that while was a big reason, I also just hated walking past Chris everyday so i moved my desk. So I casually mentioned ""oh i sit by the window now"" Chris then asked a question about if anyone had (agency) as their staffing agency and i stupidly said yes i do. then he started asking me all these stupid questions that could have very obviously been answered by asking his recruiter instead of me. He asked me about submitting time sheets and i told him you have to email them. Then he acted dumb like he had no idea and I stupidly offered to share the email with him. 

Later that afternoon I hadnt messaged him yet because I forgot, so he came up to me at my desk to follow up and continue asking me dumb questions. He stood INSIDE my cubicle way too close for comfort and made me feel really uncomfortable by standing too close to me. 

A few days later he approached my desk again but i was in a meeting with headphones in so i ignored him. He then later messaged me the question something about insurance enrollment. i just replied with a curt no we dont get insurance. and that was it.

After that i started really making sure to go out of my way to avoid him. I would take the long way to my desk, walk along the walls, always make sure he was at his desk before going to the cafeteria, etc. just becoming super hyper aware of his presence because i didnt want to run into him and be forced to smile and say hi and make small talk when i just simply didnt want to.

He started going out of his way to say hi to me. In a pod meeting a few weeks ago i was getting ready to head to the meeting room and was trying to deliberately go out my way by going through the market area to avoid running into him. He was lingering near that area and even when i tried to walk right past him he called me out by name and said hey im just going to follow you because i dont know where the meeting room is. I was like, its the same room we met in last week and there's maps on the walls....but sure. It was really uncomfortable so i tried making small talk, asked how his week is going etc but i was uncomfrotable walking with him the entire time. I just didnt want to.i guess the small talk was a coping mechanism. 

After that i started making sure i get to the conference room earlier for meetings. The next few meetings, he would always try to sit next to me as well, he'd leave one chair gap but it was still always next to me.

Earlier this week in the cafeteria i was trying to get my coffee and i was hyper aware of the fact that he was in the micromarket. I would stand facing a wall like the coffee machine and i could see his reflection in the machine. He would stand RIGHT behind me like he was hoping i would turn around and bump into him. I would move to the water station and make my coffee there. I see him move to the water station and stand RIGHT behind me. He jUst stood behind me and i took like 10 minutes to stir my coffee until he went away. and then ran out of there before he could run into me.

Then finally yesterday he finally did something that gave me the courage to report it, because I knew it was malicious, not social awkwardness. We had a team meeting and i got there before him. I took a seat, there were 4 rows, people were mostly sitting in one row but there were two full empty rows behind that row. I sat on the very edge of that row. I knew he would try to sit next to me so i deliberately pushed my chair all the way back so that it would be hard for him to walk behind me. So instead of choosing to sit in the other two rows, or even saying excuse me, he walks up right behind me, BRUSHES UP AGAINST MY BACK and says ""oh sorry"" and then sits down next to me with one chair gap. I felt immediately icky and violated like EW THIS DISGUSTING MAN JUST TOUCHED ME WITHOUT MY CONSENT. It was very obvious
It wasnt an accident. He could have sat in any of the other 12 seats in the 2 empty rows behind me. He could have said excuse me and waited for me to pull my chair forward. Instead he deliberately brushed against me and I know if felt deliberate because I felt him come in contact with my upper back and it was more than just a light brush.

I froze for a few minutes, paralyzed in fear. My entire nervous system exploded, my heart was pounding, I felt a panic attack coming on. I got up and moved to the row behind me. Keep In mind this all happened right in front our manager. It almost felt like he was trying to ""get back' at me for avoiding him so harshly in the micromarket the day before. It felt that way because i saw him walk into the meeting, walk up to my row, visibily huff (as if frustrated or slighted) and stop for a moment to contemplate whether to sit there or not. Then forced his way through without saying excuse me. 

Even after moving rows i waa aware he would walk past me on the way out of the meeting so I got up and moced to the very back row. Just in the middle of the meeting, to create more distance. When the meeting ended I immediately messaged my manager asking to speak with privately. He immediately made time and I finally told him everything I had been experiencing and what I had just experienced. I am lucky to have a really great manager who listened empathetically, validated me, took my concerns seriously, and promised he would escalate it and do anything he could do make me feel safe. He offered to let me join the meetings remotely and said he would be reporting to his supervisors. 

That very same day his manager who is head of the department/senior leadership came into the office to speak with me in person. She was working remotely but came in just to speak with me. I met with her and recounted my experience. She gave me a lot of solidarity again, support, reassurance that they would be taking care of this. She also gave me her direct number and said I could call or text anytime even just to vent or any kind of support i needed. She said she would be escalating to HR and that they will need to launch a full investigation into Chris. In the meantime later that day she let me know she did move him out of my team onto another one, so at least I wouldn't have to deal with him in meetings anymore. 

While we weren't on the same team anymore, I told the senior manager that these types of interactions happen more frequently in shared spaces like desk areas, hallways, and break rooms. She also offered to move his desk somewhere else, but I told her as long as hes in the officr i am hypervigilamy and anxious and feel unsafe. 

The next day at work (today) I get in and one of my colleagues brought in treats. She put them on her desk and people were gathering around to try some. I wanted some so I got up and got some. Unfortunately the set up was very close to Chris's desk. I noticr my manager lingering too and he gives me a reassuring nod. Now my back is turned towards him and I haven't even noticed Chris at this point. But I notice in my peripheral that my manager is moving closer towards me, kind of boxing me in a bit. I was confused so I turned around and i notice Chris right behind my manager. 

I am pretty sure I may have dissociated in that moment. Like I had realized that Skyler noticed Chris approaching me before I did, and he literally stepped in creating a physical blockade from this guy. And this dude is like super tall so I felt really safe and protected lol. 

I ran back to my desk and messaged my manager thanking him. He was like I got you. Then he gave me the update that he had been removed from the pod and that they were still in the processing of talking to HR. He told me that if I want to go home and work remotely until HR takes care of it, he said I could. He said i could leave right then and there and agreed he needs to be dismissed immediately because he could see the intentional approach. He sent me home because he acknwoacknod that he may not always be around to block him so it might be safer for me to just go home. So grateful for my manager at this point btw, he really did a great job supporting me and helping however he could. 

I went home and immediately called the senior manager who had given me her number. I told her what happened and restated that Chris's pursuit of me is now a daily occurance and that I dont feel safe. I told her my manager witnessed it first hand and that ill be working remotely until HR resolves this. I am pretty sure they are going to fire him. If not, we are all on a 3 month contract that ks suppose to renew full time. They may decide to just let me work remotely for a month and just not renew his contract. 

I really hope they fire him immediately though. Not because I want to go back to the office but because men like this need to be held accountable and face the consequences of their very intentional actions. And i am afraid of what he might try to do to any of the other girls in the office now. If he stays I will definitely be warning them all to stay away. 

Lesson of the story: dont be nice to men, you never know how they might take it....AND the minute you feel uncomfortable and find your voice and inner courage, speak up and say something. Im so glad I did. Because my manager was aware he was able to step in and help in a moment I needed him to. But he shouldn't be needing to do that all. 

Anyway, now im working remotely just processing all this shit. Isnt it fun to be a woman? ",5,1763767126.0,TwoXChromosomes,0,0.86,False

So I’m now  6 weeks post partial nephrectomy. Got some odd things going on. I don’t want to eat. Food doesn’t do anything for me. I take a couple of bites of anything and I’m done. Nothing tastes good. I can go almost all day without eating a thing. Which is not like me at all. I drink tons of water and coffee is now my breakfast.  I am forcing myself to eat. Started protein drinks yesterday because my husband is getting concerned. I am a tall and curvy woman so it won’t hurt to lose a few pounds but I would like to do it by dieting…not by not wanting to eat. Also I am craving salt. This isn’t like me at all. I have to watch my high bp so for a long time now we don’t eat a lot of salt. Yes we do use it for lightly seasoning while cooking but we don’t salt our food after it’s plated. I have been eating things like olives, salty potato chips, pickle juice etc. it’s all just really not like me at all. 
I have an appt next month that will be my 8 weeks post surgery with the surgeon but I am wanting to know if anyone else was like this?

1p3di2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1p3di2o/chronic_gastritis_duodenitis_need_help/,Chronic gastritis & duodenitis - need help.,"I'd be grateful if some experienced/knowledgeable people could offer me any advice. Apologies for the long post, but the context is needed.

I've had symptoms of gastritis/dudenitis for 7 years. Worse in the last 2 years, particularly awfully since having biopsies taken again 6 months ago. My quality of life is poor. I live in the UK.

Prior to this no other health issues. Fit and healthy, work a stressful professional job with long hours and provide for a family. No mental health issues / anxiety issues at all. Mother has Coeliac. 

Main symptoms are:

Nausea (main symptom). Worst first thing in the morning, better by the end of the day, but also worse post prandially. Sometimes it's 24/7. 

Belching and epigastric bloating  - belching momentarily improves the nausea

Loss of appetite, mid and upper abdominal burning discomfort. Sometimes reflux. When symptoms are severe, diarrhoea/looser stool. I've generally managed to maintain weight until the last few months where I've probably lost about 5kgs.

Symptoms are generally worse when lying down, but mitigated by lying on my left side.
Gym work can make it worse if I'm not careful, but it's the only thing keeping me sane.

History 

First developed milder symptoms when taking doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis in 2012 for a few months. Improved when stopping.

Over the next 6 years symptoms were mild (nausea and bloating relieved by belching) and would only be provoked by typical stomach irritants like alcohol.

2018 - first real flare of nausea/epigastric bloating/belching that was brought on by drinking coffee ++ and working night shifts for 6 months in A&E. Always worse when waking up, improved by the end of the day. Worse when went on holiday and had some wine. Took PPI for a few months, got better but never totally better. 

Had an OGD when it was all feeling better. Was normal. TTG was negative. CLO test negative.

2023. Developed really bad reflux/chest pain/sore throat during a gym workout. Came on instantly - suspected must have caused a hiatus hernia. Started iquoro. About 6 months later finally got a barium swallow. The reflux entirely resolved overnight about 3 days before the barium swallow test. However, the test itself caused a significant flare. Same symptoms but worse. Constant nausea, belching, upper abdominal bloating. Now the belching caused acid reflux. PPIs seemed to now make no difference, despite double doses. Eventually gave up PPI. Eventually came across cabbage juice, which I would just blend up at home. This helped by 50%. Did this for 6 months. Still felt sick half of the day, every day. 
Had another OGD - showed mild gastritis and duodenitis. No biopsies taken. 

I'd been off PPIs for months. One day decided to try them again. They worked. Took for 6 months before they stopped working. Came off them for a week, symptoms started to return. Restarted- worked for another 3 months. However, in this time my symptoms had improved sufficiently to live a semi normal life (avoiding all coffee, alcohol, chocolate, eating close to bed time etc). 

End of 2024 - recurrence of reflux, again from a gym workout. But now a lot worse. I thought - try to get an OGD ASAP to diagnose the hernia before it goes back again. Still took many months to get. They did biopsies this time and immediately I could tell something was going wrong. Noticed significant mid to upper abdominal pain post procedure, didn't settle for weeks and all the gastritis/duodenitis type symptoms resurfaced with an avengence. 

Since then, I can barely tolerate any food. PPI intermittently helps a bit. If I stop, I get rebound hypersecretion and it's awful. Sulcralfate - minimal help. Biopsies came back with lymphocytic duodenitis. 
Plain chicken and white rice is ok as long as I take slippery elm beforehand. Plain lentils are fine. Vegetables are fine.

I've been doing this for months. Without slippery elm I would be in real trouble. But it's expensive and I go through a tonne of the stuff.

But I'm not getting better. I'm just the same, and it's miserable. I've cut out gluten, which did seem to help initially (non Coeliac gluten enteropathy can cause lymphocytic duodenitis) but progress is now minimal or at best, non-linear. Even the most minor dietary indiscretion will fuck me for weeks (like eating a small gluten free shop bought apple cake - I assume some preservative in them).

Other notable points:

Negative SIBO breath test 2023. Tried rifaxamin anyway, no difference. I think it's unlikely to be SIBO.
Two or three negative Coeliac antibody tests 
No NSAIDs ever. 
Two 6 months rounds of Symprove pre/probiotics. First one possibly helped, or maybe I got better despite it.
Normal ultrasound of billiary system a few years ago. Never any right upper quadrant pain. No bile ever seen on gastroscopy.
Never had constipation ever.
I've taken mega mucosa without any perceivable benefit. DGL helps a tiny bit. Gaviscon advance helps for a short period. 


I don't know what to do other than keep going on an acid watchers diet, taking slippery elm inner bark 4x daily , cabbage juice, and just basically eating chicken rice and mixed veg. And hope I get better.
My working assumption is ?non-Coeliax gluten enteropathy - but I cut out gluten entirely a month ago and despite initially feeling better it hasn't been sustained. 

Gastroenterology are useless. Don't believe me when I say PPI doesn't consistently work. Have no other suggestions.

I generally feel that what I'm doing should be getting me better, but ultimately I don't know the underlying cause, and frankly I'm sick of being sick.

I would very much appreciate any reasoned insights.

withings body scan looked cool but $400 felt steep and honestly i dont need ecg stuff. seemed like paying for features id never use just to get body comp tracking

what sold me on hume was the regional breakdown. i lift 4x week and wanted to see if my right side is actually stronger or if im imagining it. overall body fat% doesnt tell you that. tried it at a friends place first and his left leg was showing 3% more muscle than right which explained his squat imbalance

battery life is whatever.. like 5 days not the 30 they claim but charges fast so i just do it while making coffee

main thing im still unsure about is whether the segmental data actually matters for training or if its just interesting to look at. like does knowing my left arm is slightly behind change what i should do vs just adding more volume overall?

for $229 vs $400 withings it made sense. renpho is cheaper but felt too inconsistent. figured id rather have reliable trends in one area than unreliable data everywhere

Most plaza cafes are in and out and not really long stay.

Might be me but I get a feeling that i need to leave once I finish brunch and taking my time on a tea or coffee esp. when they are busy that I'm usually one person taking a table.

1p3darh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1p3darh/who_did_i_date/,Who did I date?!,"This is a long one but the end is CRAZY! I changed his name. Everyone involved is in their 30’s. 

In early 2023 I met Ben, we met online and went for a walk in a local park after a couple of days of talking. I felt a connection instantly and he around to my place a couple of days later. Then a couple of days after that we went on a date. Right from the beginning we had long deep conversations I shared my history of trauma and abuse, he shared about wealthy but emotionally absent parents. He also told me that a few years before he was engaged and that she died. That she broke up with him because she didn’t want him to go through watching her decline and she died a few months later, that her parents didn’t allow him to go to the funeral because of his alternative lifestyle. 

In the beginning the relationship was amazing, I felt deeply connected and cherished. Over time things changed he would be absent with no communication for days, saying work was crazy or that because of ADHD he just forgets to respond to messages. His life seemed to deteriorate, illness, chronic pain, mental health issues, drama after drama. It seemed like literally nothing was going his way so I did my best to be supportive and help him. Walking his dog most days, running errands for him etc. 

Right from the beginning he told me he was polyamorous. I hadn’t been in a poly relationship before but I liked him enough to give it a go. We set boundaries (mostly stated by him but I agreed with them) we tell each other if we sleep with someone else and we use protection with others. Initially he said we’d just get to know each other and build a foundation for our relationship before bringing in others. He told me that we were primary partners. 

I probably need to mention that over time I realised this guy was rarely sober, he drank a lot and did other substances frequently. I did MD with his a few times, and I’d have an occasional big night but I wasn’t drinking every day. 

One day he surprised me by telling me he was talking to another woman (someone I knew) and that they were going out for coffee. I was surprised as I thought we weren’t doing that yet but said okay that I knew she was a lovely person. The day they went out I became very anxious and we spoke on the phone about it later that night. He was reassuring and supportive. I was grateful and explained that this was new to me and I wanted to do it but it might just take me a while to learn and adjust. He continued talking to the other girl off and on and I ended up chatting more with an old fwb and eventually with Ben’s knowledge and consent I hooked up with him. I thought it was all okay but then Ben started making weird comments about not having as big of a dick as the other guy. I kind of just brushed it off. 

Over time Ben became really critical of me. I couldn’t express any emotion or talk about any of my problems without him launching into long lectures about all of the things I should be doing or about how I was too sensitive and my emotions were my responsibility and not his to deal with. I began feeling like I was going crazy, we’d have a discussion and then the next time we spoke it seemed like I’d understood everything wrong or that his opinion had completely flipped. He spent less and less time with me blaming work, our schedules and his mental health, intimacy became nonexistent. 

He picked back up talking to the other girl and I explained that I was a little hurt because I barely got to see him, he became very upset with me and lectured me about how if we had other relationships that it had nothing to do with our relationship. I reconnected with a long time friend who was also an old flame. I told Ben and asked if it was okay for me to persue the connection, he said it was. But when I did he got upset saying he felt like I cheated and that it was unacceptable in polyamory to do this, he told me to imagine that his ex fiancée was still alive and came back into the picture. I was so confused. I then found out through a friend that he and the other girl had started sleeping together. Since he hadn’t said anything I considered that a breach of our rules. 

Her and I had also been talking under the assumption that we were aiming for kitchen table poly and that he was being honest with both of us. When she found out that he hadn’t told me she messaged me to let me know that it had also been unprotected, which was one of our rules and we had discussed not wanting to get anyone outside of our primary relationship pregnant. I considered this cheating and broke up with him. 

I barely spoke to him for a couple of weeks then we went on a walk and had a long talk, similar to when we started dating. He told me he loved me and that I was his best friend, that we could work on rebuilding trust and eventually get back together, that he saw him and I together at the end of the day and that he wanted to grow old with me. 

For the next month and a half we caught up regularly as friends but we’re still telling each other we loved each other and I did stay at his place one night and in his bed for another afternoon, both times cuddled up but no sex. He had cried to me about worrying that he’d fucked it all up and that he loved me. Then out of nowhere he went dark for a week, a quick voice message on my birthday but nothing else. 

Out of nowhere he called me one morning apologising for being absent and explained that in the two weeks after the breakup he hooked up with someone, she was pregnant 90% sure he was the father. He told me he had to focus on that and that he really needed me as his best friend to get through this. Initially I agreed but later that day I messaged saying I couldn’t, that I didn’t want to be just his best friend and that I couldn’t watch him have a baby with someone else. 

We went for a walk to talk about it which basically ended in him yelling at me for being selfish and that his whole life was fucked now because of this baby but also I should be happy for him because new life is beautiful. I was a mess and told him I needed to go no contact for a few weeks. 

The other girl and I, as well as one of our mutual friends had become very close since the breakup, they pulled me through it and when I told them I went no contact they were both relieved saying on days I didn’t talk to him I was happy and then I’d see him and fall apart. I ended up extending no contact indefinitely only seeing him to exchange a few things. The whole relationship lasted just over a year. 

It has been almost a year since I had any contact with Ben at all. I am doing very well in a beautiful, healthy relationship with an absolutely incredible man. 

So here’s where things get crazy. I spoke to a friend who knows Ben’s baby’s mother and her friends. They were in a relationship and lived together, they started dating before we broke up and knew each other for months before then. They thought he was excited to be a dad and that he was very keen to be in a relationship with her. But he became violent with her, screamed at her frequently went out drinking after the baby was born. Other things came out too, past IVOs, huge debt, he had cheated on me in the May of 2024 at a camping trip, all sorts of lies. One stand out, he was never engaged. That woman had a completely different partner when she passed away and they had only been together for a year or so, a couple’s of years before she passed away. The mother of his baby now has an IVO against him because of violence. 

I’m not upset for myself in any of this. I’m healed and moved on. I actually consider myself lucky now for getting out when I did. I am concerned for the baby and the mother, as well as any women that meet him in the future. I’m also just like, who the fuck is this guy? ",7,1763766292.0,TwoHotTakes,3,1.0,False

A bit about my background, I’m from a HCOL area and hold 4 years of industry accounting experience in the healthcare industry. Went to get my Masters to leverage the career resources and networking opportunities. I have a 3.8 GPA and have passed 4/4 CPA exams but the ROI for my masters has been lacking as majority of the firms that came to my campus barely posted any audit or advisory positions. It’s mostly tax roles or internships which I don’t qualify for as my graduation date does not align with their internship recruitment timeline. Many of my peers aren’t having any luck with their job searches. Some of my peers bullshited their way into landing a tax associate role knowing that they wanted to be in audit or advisory. The ones that are fairing better are the 4th and 5th year undergrad or graduate students that secured their full time roles a year in advance with the firms they interned. 

Among the 14 firms I applied for, I networked with 6 different firms/hiring managers from campus events and initiated coffee chats with 3 other firms/hiring managers and landed 2 referrals for audit associate and wasn’t even selected for an interview. 😭 I had 2 recruiters that moved me up from the screening round only for me to wait weeks in silence regarding when I will receive an interview only to get ghosted or a typical rejection email saying “we like you and it was a pleasure bla bla bla, but we’re at full capacity.” 😤 I had a recruiter from one of the B4 firms reach out to me and I landed a scenario and behavioral interview but was not selected for the offer. I just received a $73K offer which is decent for a small firm but the benefits are abysmal (only $1K CPA bonus, 10 days accrued PTO, 6 paid holidays, and 3% employer match after 2 years)

I honestly never imagined I’d be in this situation. My boyfriend is Mexican (like me), extremely hardworking, respectful, loving, and has amazing morals. He’s nothing like his family, which is why I was so blindsided when I realized just how toxic they all are — especially his mother.

His mom is one of the most narcissistic and emotionally immature people I’ve ever met. She has 6 kids, and every single one of them struggles in one way or another… except my boyfriend. He’s the only stable, successful one, and it’s almost like she resents him for being different.

From the beginning, she targeted me. The first time I ever met her was at the hospital after my boyfriend had a seizure. I was nervous and shy, so I simply said “hello.” Later she told me that wasn’t good enough and that I was supposed to greet her with: “Hello, how are you, and is there anything I can do for you?” (What?? who demands that?)

It only got worse.
	•	She once kicked me out of her house and then tried to play it off as “a joke.”
	•	At her birthday party, drunk, she pinched me hard for no reason.
	•	She made her sister bully me by saying I “look like someone who doesn’t do manual labor” because my nails looked too perfect.
	•	They told me anytime I visit I should check their kitchen for dishes to wash.
	•	She expected me to show up with hot coffee in hand for her.

It was constant boundary-pushing, nitpicking, and weird tests. Always behind my boyfriend’s back.

Their entire family dynamic is strange, basically zero communication. So my boyfriend hasn’t confronted them because this is VERY new and scary for him. He grew up walking on eggshells and avoiding conflict. I don’t want to pressure him, but I also don’t want to carry this alone.

I’ve been no-contact with all of them for over a year now. My bf says they don’t ever even bring me up, which feels so weird after all they put me through.

For context: my boyfriend gets treated like an absolute king by my family. My parents and sisters adore him. The contrast between our families is insane.

I feel stuck. How do I move on from all the disrespect, the trauma, and the way they tried to tear me down? How do I make peace with the fact that he still hasn’t said anything to them?

Any advice from people who’ve dealt with toxic Mexican in laws, narcissistic MILs, or boundary violating families would be appreciated. I just want to heal and feel normal in my relationship again.
