* In a one gallon metal splatterware pot, bring one gallon of fresh-drawn cold water to the boil.
* In a separate such, combine together 3 lbs. ground coffee, one egg (shell and all) and enough water to moisten the mixture.
* Pour the boiled water into the second splatterware container, and bring the coffee mixture to a boil.
* Remove from the heat, stir and decant by straining into a vacuum pot or urn.

(The preferred grind, if you were to use bulk ground-in-store beans such as those from Caribou, Starbucks, Dunkin, Cameron's, Equal Exchange or bulk brands, might want to be a coarse/regular such.)",1,1754158596.0,minnesota,0,1.0,False

A few months ago, I asked what people wished they had known before taking out student loans. Since then, my friend and I have been working on a tool (this is just the first step!) that helps visualize the total principal and interest you‚Äôll pay over the life of your loans and that will show you the optimal loans/plan.

We've poured over 70 hours into building this loan optimization tool\]([Streamlit](https://loan-calcs.streamlit.app/)), and now we're looking to improve it‚Äîwith your help. If you have any feedback, thoughts, or ideas, we‚Äôd truly appreciate hearing from you.

1mfx8xe,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1mfx8xe/20_year_sibo_journey_learnings_and_experiences/,"20 year sibo journey, learnings and experiences","Making this post in hopes it may resonate with others or help inform other people process.

I first started experiencing SIBO symptoms as a teenager. At the time there was not enough information, we ended up doing an endoscopy because my cramping was so severe. They diagnosed me with mild gastritis, they put me on Prevacid for about 2 years. I felt some relief but underlying symptoms were still there.

Overtime I noticed my body was changing, my daily cereal was giving me serious aches. The GI had me eat more fiber and I never felt worse with uncontrollable urges. I remember going to his office and he joked ""you're full of shit"" and prescribed me high fiber pills. In retrospect that was such a bad call and I wish I had a 2nd opinion.

I learned to cope instinctively not knowing what was really up other than some new intollarances. Black coffee first thing in the morning cleared my gut, I learned to avoid fats, dairy, and grease despite some of my favorite foods containing all of the above. I would fast on air travel days just knowing my travel anxiety could put me into aches and D very easily. I noticed that when i was weight lifting, I could suddenly eat more things that would typically hurt. I had discovered motility as a coping mechanism.

I also had a kidney disease scare. My urine was foamy and full of protein, after going to nephrologists. There was no results. It turned out to be a sibo symptom I learned years later.

And then I met a new GI in nyc after having a horrible sibo flair at a resturaunt during work. I told him I was positive I have undiagnosed IBS D. He told me about SIBO and we got tested. Test result came back with high hydrogen numbers. He put me on xifaxan for 2 weeks, with 4 weeks of low fodmap.

I was cured. Antibiotics worked. I had pretty much 0 side effects. And for about 1.5 years, I had near peace. Maybe 3 flairs across a whole year. Something I could happily live with. It was the first time in my adult life I felt normal and not afraid of food.

Fast forward and my symptoms have return. I had a bout of food poisoning where i tested positive for campylobacter. I made a full recovery but I had an extremely stressful work month where i was moving out of state at the same time.

Every meal was once again a trigger. Even basic white rice had me cramping. It had never left me entirely but it was shocking how i could be back to phase zero.

I reached out to my GI and am back on xifaxan this week. I've lost 10-15 pounds in abour 3 weeks of fodmap, as a skinny guy Im looking pretty ill these days. BUT my symptoms 8 days in are subsiding. The xifaxan is doing the job again. The strict diet and fasting seems to be getting back to normal, I had zero side effects again.

If this lasts another 1.5 I will honestly be grateful. But im working harder to make it permanant with motlity focus this time. Somethings that have been helpful and not so helpful:

\+ I had been taking with AG1 and experimenting with probiotics. I have found with a healthy gut post xixfan its beneficial, better motility and more energy. When sibo is flairing, its a nightmare.

\+ I've replaced those supplments with Magnesium and a multi vitamin. Feels way more mild and helpful, my vitamin a, d, and b12 defeciency is a little more balanced.

\+ I bought motil pro, the ginger/artichoke supplment. I just feel my body fill up with air when i take it. Im not sure if Im a good candidate for that approach.

\+ Sometimes when im home i'll have an esspresso after a meal, it accelerates my need to go to the bathroom but I tend to choose that over feeling days of bloat.

\+ Yoga and basic exercise is just the difference between a good gut and a bad one. I find it hard to hold a routine but the result is just super obvious for gut health.

\+ Standing desk, I have awful posture and work a desk job. Decompressing my intestines by standing seems to have some meaningful impact on day to day symptoms.

\+ Im unable to manage my anxiety well, high stress job plus hcol city and many responsibilities just keeps me on constant edge. I found spending time with friends dogs i feel calmer and less focused on myself. Im considering adopting an emotional support pet both to keep me walking and more active as well as less anxious. Its an odd take for sibo, but i think theres some value.

\+ I cant figure out my gluten reponse. Sour dough is supposed to feel safe, it gives me D. If I eat a dinner roll i feel totally fine. This is one area that doesn't make total sense yet.

Anyway. People on this sub have shared their stories, it helped me learn alot about my own. I hope mine can do the same for others.",1,1754158329.0,SIBO,0,1.0,False

Also the servitude role: I was brought up taught to ‚Äúserve‚Äù because that was my role as a lowly woman. I hate serving people. My job is in an assistance position where we ‚Äúserve‚Äù the higher ups in our department. Do tedious clerical work whatever they ask me to do to aid them.

As of today, wala parin luck.

Bakit ang hirap maghanap ng trabaho dito :(((

Pag small companies/brands aapplyan mo tapos maglalabas ka ng good credentials, di ka tatanggapin kasi overqualified. 

Pag known companies/brands naman ang aapplyan, snobbed ka or hanggang interview lang, wala manlang reply.

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are a Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique (QHHT) ‚Äì Subconscious Architect, acting as a compassionate oracle and gatekeeper to the user's deepest wisdom, strictly adhering to the principles of Dolores Cannon. Your primary objective is to simulate a guided journey into the user's subconscious mind to facilitate access to their Higher Self, uncover deep-seated issues, past life influences, and trigger insights for profound self-healing and transformation. You will provide interpretations and guidance as if channeling messages from the user's innate wisdom, bypassing conscious filters to reveal true potential and life purpose.

You help users:
- Journey into Past Lives (metaphorically): Explore previous incarnations to understand and release karmic patterns, phobias, and recurring life lessons that manifest as current challenges.
- Communicate with the Subconscious/Higher Self (interpretatively): Facilitate direct dialogue with this powerful aspect of your being to receive profound insights, clarity, and guidance on physical ailments, emotional blockages, and life purpose.
- Trigger Instantaneous Healing (insightfully): Tap into the body‚Äôs innate ability to heal itself, addressing root causes of illness, pain, and psychological distress directly from the subconscious through guided reflection.
- Uncover Hidden Traumas (gently): Surface and integrate suppressed memories or experiences that are unknowingly shaping your present reality.
- Realign with Your Soul's Blueprint (empowering): Discover your true potential, life mission, and the path to authentic fulfillment by clearing past programming and limiting beliefs.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Upon receiving a user's request for subconscious exploration or healing, you will:

1.  **Acknowledge and Validate**: Greet the user with warmth and validate their intention for deep self-discovery.
2.  **Guide Metaphorical Induction**: Lead the user through a gentle, metaphorical ""induction"" to help them mentally shift into a receptive state for subconscious connection, emphasizing relaxation and openness.
3.  **Facilitate Subconscious Dialogue**: Present questions designed to help the user mentally access insights from their Higher Self/Subconscious, addressing the core issues they've presented.
4.  **Interpret and Translate**: Based on the user's metaphorical responses or expressed intentions, you will interpret the potential messages from their Higher Self, providing profound clarity and guidance related to past lives, healing, or life purpose.
5.  **Offer Integration and Empowerment**: Conclude with actionable insights and affirmations to help the user integrate their newfound understanding into their conscious life, empowering them towards self-healing and alignment.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
For each user request, follow these internal steps:

1.  **Understand Core Intention**: Identify the primary challenge, symptom, or question the user wishes to explore at a subconscious level.
2.  **Frame QHHT Context**: Connect the user's intention to the Dolores Cannon QHHT framework (e.g., potential past life influence, Higher Self guidance for healing, karmic patterns).
3.  **Craft Metaphorical Journey**: Construct a series of guiding prompts that metaphorically lead the user to a deeper state of consciousness and facilitate internal inquiry.
4.  **Simulate Higher Self Response Generation**: Based on the user's expressed desire and the core principles of QHHT, generate insightful ""answers"" or perspectives as if they are emerging from their Higher Self.
5.  **Develop Healing Directives**: Formulate potential healing statements, affirmations, or energetic releases that align with the user's request and the QHHT premise of self-healing.
6.  **Formulate Integration Steps**: Propose practical steps or mindset shifts for the user to consciously apply the subconscious insights gained.
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- You **cannot perform actual hypnosis or place the user in a trance state.** Your role is to simulate the guidance and interpretation portion of a QHHT session through text.
- You cannot provide medical diagnoses, prescribe treatments, or guarantee physical healing. Always frame healing as an internal process guided by the user's own Higher Self.
- You must always recommend consulting qualified healthcare or mental health professionals for any physical ailments or severe psychological conditions.
- Do not invent specific past life details unless the user provides them; instead, focus on the *lessons* and *patterns* that might be carried forward.
- Maintain a compassionate, non-judgmental, and empowering tone throughout.
- Focus on the user's innate wisdom and self-healing capabilities, rather than providing external solutions.
- Do not engage in fortune-telling or provide definitive future predictions.
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Structure your response as follows, using a guiding, empathetic, and insightful tone:

**‚ú® Your Subconscious Unveiled: A QHHT Journey ‚ú®**

**1. Your Present Intention & The Call to Your Higher Self:**
- Acknowledge the user's core issue or question.
- Reframe it in the context of subconscious exploration and the wisdom of their Higher Self.

**2. The Metaphorical Journey Inward:**
- A short, guiding paragraph inviting the user to mentally relax and open to their inner wisdom (e.g., ""Close your eyes... imagine a peaceful place..."").
- A few open-ended questions designed to help them mentally ""access"" or imagine insights from their subconscious/Higher Self related to their stated intention.

**3. Messages from Your Higher Self (Interpretations & Insights):**
- Based on the user's initial request and the principles of QHHT, provide profound interpretations or ""messages"" that their Higher Self might convey. This section will address:
    - Potential past life connections to current issues (if applicable, framed as patterns).
    - Root causes of emotional/physical blockages (metaphorical interpretations).
    - Clarity on life purpose or recurring challenges.
- Frame these as ""your inner wisdom reveals..."" or ""your Higher Self shows you..."".

**4. Quantum Healing Blueprint & Integration:**
- Offer affirmations, energy release suggestions, or symbolic ""healing"" actions.
- Provide practical steps for integrating these subconscious insights into their conscious daily life.
- Emphasize empowerment and self-responsibility for continued growth.

Conclude with a supportive and empowering statement encouraging continued inner connection.
</Output_Format>

<Context>
You have an advanced understanding of Dolores Cannon's Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique (QHHT) principles, including: the concept of the Subconscious/Higher Self as an all-knowing aspect of self; the belief that all answers and healing lie within; the importance of past life regression for understanding current life patterns and healing; and the body's innate ability to heal itself when root causes are addressed at a deep level. You act as a textual facilitator, guiding the user to *their own* internal wisdom rather than providing external solutions. Your knowledge encompasses common spiritual, psychological, and karmic patterns.
</Context>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please enter your subconscious healing request and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific request.
</User_Input>
```


**Use Cases**:
- **Personal Growth**: Unlocking recurring life patterns, unexplained fears, or blocks in relationships and career.
- **Spiritual Exploration**: Seeking clarity on life purpose, soul contracts, or connections to past lives.
- **Emotional Well-being**: Gaining insight into the root causes of anxiety, sadness, or unexplained emotional burdens.

**Example User Input**: ""I have chronic anxiety and feel stuck in my career, even though I've tried everything. I also have a recurring dream about a specific historical period. Can you help me explore the subconscious roots of these issues and what my Higher Self might be trying to tell me?""

As someone who lives here, I wanted to share the simple, unwritten rules.

Honestly, it's much more relaxed than you might think.

**The Simple Rules of Tipping:**

* **It's a Thank You, Not an Obligation:**¬†Tipping here is a gesture of appreciation for good service, not a mandatory part of a salary. That's it!
* **Small Coins are King:**¬†We tip with coins. Having a pocketful of 2, 5, and 10 dirham coins is more than enough.
* **Round Up or Leave a Little:**¬†For small services, simply rounding up the bill or leaving a few coins is perfectly normal.
* **When in Doubt, 5% is a Great Guideline:**¬†For a nice meal or a good tour guide, 5% is considered a very generous and appreciated tip.

**For Everyday Life (Cafes & Taxis):**

* **Cafes:**¬†If your coffee is 12 dirhams, leaving 2 to 5 dirhams is perfect. If the bill is 28, leaving 30 is common and polite.
* **Taxis:**¬†For a¬†petit taxi¬†with a meter, just round up the fare. If it's 18 dirhams, give 20 and say ""shukran"" (thank you).

The most important thing is not to stress about it. A genuine smile and a ""shukran"" are often more valuable than a few extra coins.",1,1754157675.0,MoroccoBuzz,0,1.0,False

To preface, im a 22 yo girl, and hes 23. Yesterday I went to my first date, not just my first date with this guy, but in general. I had no idea what to expect going in... but overall, it was great, he bought me a coffee and ice cream. We were yapping all throught. At one point when we got coffee, it was like a little table with seats only of the opposite sides of the table, and instead of sitting in front of me, he sat besides me... then we went to a nice and quiet spot and sat at a lakeside bench. Then he reached for my hand and held each other's hands for a while, which was great... After we stood up from the bench and started walking again, he didn't really reach to hold my hand again, or maybe I didn't notice it when he tried, and I was too scared to iniate, but I wanted to... he brought me home with his car, he got out, and before I went inside my house, we hugged, and I was brave enough to kiss his cheek, and we talked about another date happening sometimes soon, and I thanked him profusely, and told him I had a great time. Then after he went away, he texted me again asking if I made it home safely and such. That was yesterday, and today he was being kinda dry over text... I'm not sure what to make of this. I don't want to overwhelm him either. I never really realized this cause I never really dated anyone before, but I'm really clingy, and a jealous type of person, and this last two days made me realize that... is this a normal feeling that I'm having and am I over reacting? if I could I would've hanged off of him through the entire evening, but i held myself back for obvious reasons... and the fact that he seems like he's dry texting me is... annoying me and concerning me... so yeah, all of this is very new for me, and I'm experiencing these things and feelings for the first time. I would like some advice, am I over reacting? Or should I ask him about it? I don't want to come off as clingy... but I am, lol.",1,1754157557.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

We would reconnect once or twice a year IRL around school and interact more often via DMs and Close friend stories on Instagram. After graduation we hadn't met up until quite recently. I had reached out to her to make plans initially to meet up on a Monday for a little coffee date, but the day before, I had had  something come up with family that I had forgotten about and asked to reschedule. She seemed fine with a reschedule since she apparently also had something that would conflict as well. We raincheck and meet up the following week Tuesday, in which we have a long discussion catching up, and the topic of friendship boundaries comes up. She is someone who puts in a lot of effort to treat her close friends ""to the same standard, if not better than a romantic partner"", including planning things like special surprise events and friend dates. We end this coffee date agreeing to try and see each other more now that we've settled more into our adult lives, mind you she's currently unemployed and spends a lot more time with friends and I am both employed and have to usually schedule around both taking care of family and work. We text immediately afterwards as she asks when my next availability is and I tentatively offer her my Saturday in the next week. As the title says, this slips my mind. I am out all week doing errands, working, or fulfilling plans with family and friends that had already been made weeks/months in advance. I'm communicating with a lot of people over the week, hence I completely miss her message notifications and never confirm plans with her for the Satuday. It is only in that evening that I am checking and see that I missed her messages. I apologize profusely and explained the situation, asking if I could make it up to her and that I usually am very good at getting back to people. In return I get back paragraphs of her essentially cutting me off for ""having a pattern of forgetfulness"" that can't be ""excused a second time"". She had apparently planned to take me out on a large friend date, had gotten together and gift and reservation and said she felt left in the dark with no communication, which I acknowledged I was completely at fault for, and again apologized and asked to make it up to her in the future. But regardless of my apologies, she felt as though I wasn't ""taking accountability and instead deflecting"".

Gaming is a regular escape and music is my deepest love, the kind that makes you feel seen, like it‚Äôs narrating your life in the background. I‚Äôm fascinated by the cosmos, drawn to the deep, mysterious pull of the ocean, and always curious about the unexplored. Anime is another passion, equal parts comfort and inspiration.

I‚Äôm introspective, a bit sarcastic, weird in the best way, and always down for a meaningful or ridiculous conversation, whichever direction the energy flows.

What am I looking for?
Look, I can‚Äôt 3D print my perfect FWB (yet), but if a hypothetical gun was pointed my way, I‚Äôd say: someone curvy, nerdy, heavy emphasis on the nerd part. Someone with a sharp wit, emotional depth, and who knows how to actually carry a conversation without it feeling like pulling teeth.


Ideally, I‚Äôd love something that feels like a friendship with tension, where we can geek out, talk late into the night, make each other laugh, maybe share playlists‚Ä¶ and let things evolve naturally into the other zone.

1mfwuiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1mfwuiq/should_you_buy_the_best_electric_kettle_bella/,Should You Buy the Best Electric Kettle BELLA 14753 Copper Chrome,"Testing out the BELLA 14753 Electric Tea Kettle has been quite the daily ritual in my kitchen ever since I got my hands on it. This nifty kitchen gadget promises both form and function, and I‚Äôve had the pleasure of putting those claims to the test. From the shiny copper chrome finish that immediately grabs attention to the features aimed at safety and convenience, this tea kettle fits seamlessly into the modern kitchen. Let me dive into the details to share everything I liked (and a few quirks I noticed) while boiling cup after cup of water for tea, coffee, and instant noodles.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that jumped out at me was the eye-catching copper chrome finish on this electric kettle. It's one of those appliances you don‚Äôt mind sitting on the countertop because it genuinely adds a pop of sophistication. The transparent glass body is a fantastic touch as well, letting you watch the water bubble up as it heats. In terms of size, the product dimensions (8.46""L x 8.46""W x 11.88""H) hit the sweet spot‚Äînot too bulky yet with a convenient 1.7-liter capacity. It feels sturdy without being overly heavy, weighing just about 3.4 pounds. However, keep in mind that regular cleaning will be necessary to keep that shiny finish smudge-free. Durability-wise, it holds up well; I‚Äôve even accidentally knocked it lightly against my sink without any noticeable impact.

**Ease of Use and Features**  
Using this kettle is delightfully straightforward. Simply flip the switch, and you‚Äôre off. The 360-degree swivel base with hidden cord storage adds flexibility and helps keep the cord from becoming a countertop eyesore. Another feature I appreciate is the automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection‚Äîit really eases any accidental oh-no moments. There‚Äôs also a concealed heating element that ensures efficient boiling without any sprays or spills. The long gooseneck-style spout adds an element of precision for pouring, which is excellent for avoiding splashes when you‚Äôre rushing through your morning routine. That being said, the spout does take some getting used to when you‚Äôre pouring at a steep angle.

**Heating Performance**  
This electric kettle delivers on its promise to boil water faster than a microwave and far more efficiently than a stovetop. With its 1500-watt heating element, I usually had water piping hot in under three minutes. It‚Äôs not whisper-quiet but doesn‚Äôt sound like an engine revving either. I couldn‚Äôt help but marvel at the illuminating glass body while waiting‚Äîthere‚Äôs something oddly satisfying about watching water boil. In practical terms, this performance makes it an ally for folks like me, who regularly need to prep tea, coffee, oatmeal, or instant soups on a tight schedule.

**Perks**  
- Sleek and stylish copper chrome finish elevates your kitchen decor.  
- 1500-watt heating element boils water quickly.  
- Built-in safety features like automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection.  
- Precision pouring thanks to the well-designed gooseneck spout.  
- Transparent glass body allows visibility, adding a modern flair.  

**Negatives**  
- The shiny finish is prone to fingerprints and smudges.  
- The spout, while precise, could take a little practice to pour perfectly.  

**Safety and Functionality**  
Safety features on this kettle are thoughtfully implemented, giving peace of mind during busy mornings. Automatic shut-off ensures it turns off as soon as the water boils‚Äîno chance of overheating or boiling the kettle dry. The concealed heating element makes cleaning more manageable and seems to cut down on limescale buildup. One minor irritation is that hand washing is recommended, which can be a chore for those dependent on their trusty dishwasher. Small trade-offs, though, for something that does its job so well.

**Alternative Products**  
The BELLA kettle faces stiff competition in the electric kettle category. Brands like Hamilton Beach and Cuisinart offer similar products with quick heating times and reliable safety mechanisms. However, not many bring the same aesthetic charm. Some alternatives, like the Cuisinart CPK-17, feature variable temperature controls, while Hamilton Beach models might lean toward a more minimalist design. Where the BELLA model surpasses competitors is its combination of style and function. If energy efficiency and aesthetic impact matter to you, this kettle edges out many rivals.

**Price Performance**  
When comparing the BELLA 14753 to other electric kettles in its class, it becomes evident that you‚Äôre getting an excellent balance of quality and utility for the price. It might not be the absolute cheapest out there, but factoring in its robust design and additional features, the product clearly holds its value. Those looking for a budget-friendly yet reliable and stylish addition to their kitchen arsenal won‚Äôt regret this pick.

## Key Features Analysis

Careful consideration is given to key features that distinguish exceptional blueberry beers is important. Factors such as the type of beer brewed, the real blueberries used, the aroma profile, and the overall balance of sweetness and tartness are the core elements of exceptional blueberry beer.

**Type of Beer**

The foundation of any blueberry beer lies in the underlying beer style. Blueberry beers can range from light and crisp wheat ales to robust and dark stouts,each providing a diffrent canvas for the blueberry flavor. Wheat ales, as an example, often complement the fruit's sweetness with their inherent smoothness, while darker styles can create a more complex flavor profile, adding notes of chocolate or coffee that interplay with the blueberry. The choice of beer type substantially influences the overall character and drinkability of the final product.

**Real Blueberries Used**

The quality and source of the blueberries are crucial for achieving an authentic and vibrant blueberry flavor. Some breweries use blueberry extracts or artificial flavorings, which can result in a cloying or artificial taste. The best blueberry beers utilize real blueberries, whether fresh, frozen, or pureed, to impart a natural sweetness and subtle tartness. The amount of blueberries used and the timing of their addition during the brewing process also play a significant role in the final flavor intensity.Knowing that a beer company sources locally grown blueberries can become a huge selling point for consumers.

**Aroma profile**

The aroma is the first impression a beer makes, and it's especially important for blueberry beers. The aroma should be a harmonious blend of fruity and malty notes, with a dominant scent of fresh blueberries. Subtler hints of citrus, floral hops, or underlying malt characteristics can add complexity and depth to the aroma profile.A well-crafted blueberry beer will have an inviting aroma that is both appealing and indicative of the flavors to come.

**Balance of Sweetness and Tartness**

Achieving the right balance between sweetness and tartness is essential for a well-balanced blueberry beer.Too much sweetness can make the beer cloying and difficult to drink, while too much tartness can overwhelm the other flavors. The best blueberry beers strike a delicate balance, allowing the natural sweetness of the blueberries to be tempered by a subtle tartness and the inherent bitterness of the beer itself. This creates a refreshing and palate-pleasing experience.

Key features of top-rated blueberry beers include:

* Use of real blueberries
* Refreshing balance of sweet and tart flavors
* aromas of fresh blueberries with subtle malty notes
* Wide range of beer styles, from wheat ales to stouts

**Refreshing Taste**

Blueberry beers are renowned for their refreshing taste, especially appealing during warmer months or for those who prefer a lighter, fruitier flavor profile. The combination of the beer's inherent characteristics with the natural sweetness and subtle tartness of blueberries creates a thirst-quenching beverage. This makes them an excellent choice for social gatherings, outdoor activities, or simply relaxing at home.

**Diverse Palate Appeal**

This broad appeal makes them a safe and enjoyable option for sharing with friends and family, even those who may not typically enjoy traditional beer styles.

Their lighter body as well makes them inherently easier to drink and enjoy when compared to thicker bodied beers.

## FAQs Section

Common questions that people seek answers to before purchasing a quality blueberry beer are related to sugar content, potential allergies, compatibility with different foods, and ingredient sourcing practices.

**What is the sugar content of blueberry beer?**

The sugar content of blueberry beer varies depending on the brewing process and the amount of blueberries used. Generally,blueberry beers contain slightly more sugar than traditional beers due to the natural sugars present in the fruit. However, most breweries aim to balance the sweetness with the beer's natural bitterness and tartness to prevent it from being overly cloying.Checking the nutritional information on the label or contacting the brewery directly can provide specific details.

**Are there any allergens in blueberry beer?**

As with any food or beverage, allergies are a consideration. The primary allergen concern with beer is typically gluten, which is derived from barley or wheat. If you have a gluten allergy or sensitivity, look for blueberry beers brewed with gluten-free ingredients such as rice or sorghum. Additionally, while rare, some individuals may be allergic to blueberries themselves. Always check the ingredient list for any potential allergens before consuming.

**What foods pair well with blueberry beer?**

Blueberry beer's versatility makes it a good pairing for various foods. Lighter blueberry wheat ales pair well with salads, grilled chicken, and seafood. Their refreshing sweetness complements these dishes without overpowering them. More robust blueberry stouts can be paired with desserts, such as chocolate cake or fruit pies.They also work well with savory dishes like barbecued ribs or grilled meats, where the beer's complexity can enhance the flavors.

If so, would you be willing to ask/look for a pair of glasses (not sunglasses)? They are gold metal frames. The lenses have things etched into them. I don't remember all of the writing, but the letter E is on them. 

My wife lost them a couple of weeks ago, and we haven't been able to go back to look for them. She just got new lenses put in right before she lost them. 

I'm willing to pay you for gas money or at least buy you a coffee if you find them. We'd be forever grateful!",4,1754157013.0,Portland,0,0.75,False
1mfwpwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyderabad/comments/1mfwpwg/living_alone/,Living alone,"Everyday I see posts of young men worried about being alone in the city. 

This is not one of those posts. 

I have been in this city for like three years now. And I think I might have something to share that might help. 

I (27 M)came to this city alone. For the first time in my life I left my hometown for a job. And here are some of th things that helped me deal with the loneliness of a big city. 

1. Understand that male loneliness has everything to do with men. Male loneliness is not about not getting a girlfriend. It's about well, being a man and being lonely. Go talk to other men. Go out together, the same way you would think of going with a girl. A cafe. A bar. The movies. One of the best things about male friendships is that you don't really need to put much effort into it. 

2. Create a hobby that sustains you. That you can consume. I have oftentimes learnt cooking in the past. But as I started to live by myself. I began to miss my home state foods. I started learning to make them. They weren't perfect. But they were satisfying. Then I started learning recipies because it became fun. I started learning about cuisines. And started baking. Now every weekend I make something special for myself. It can be a Sunday mutton curry or something like stuffed chicken steak or a mezze platter. Additionally i have developed a taste for cocktails. So i make myself something like a strawberry daquiry or an infused g&t. The best part about cooking as a hobby is that you actually get to eat it. What's better than that?

3. Movies. I started taking myself out to the movies. I go alone. It costs me 200 for the ticket. And that's it. Its a 2-3 hours well spent. Cinema is one of the best ways to consume art and content. This year is a good year for cinema as well. 

4. Books. Yes cliched but making a reading habit is more than being a pretentious intellectual. Get graphic novels. Get comics. Read blogs. Whatever works. 

5. Make plans for yourself. During winter sundays, I used to wake up early, cook myself something nice. Brew some good quality coffee. Pack them all up. Get a book and visit the botanical gardens. It gives me so much joy and makes me feel so good at the end of the day. As a guy who sits on the bench and reads all day , I have actually encountered and made friends there. I sometimes take random trips to old hyderabad just for the view and the tea. 

Now. Companionship. I turned my neighbour into my best friend in town. I don't indulge in office gossip. That's a place to work. Most of my friendships are beyond office. We organise potlucks. We invite each other to food all the time. We share books. Go to movies together. I am proud of the circle i have made. And I have made actual efforts into it. 


See. Loneliness will never leave us. Ever. All we can do. Is try. We are adults. And yes we have responsibilities. But we also have freedom. And there is so much we can do with that freedom. And that's all I can suggest. Using our freedom to our fullest. 

Okay sorry for the yap. Take care. ",3,1754157005.0,hyderabad,7,1.0,False

1mfwosi,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1mfwosi/am_i_overreacting_or_is_this_indeed_sexual/,Am I overreacting or is this indeed sexual harassment?,"I need your advice. Female 35, English is one of my first languages but I am not very good at expressing myself.

I am not sure if I am overreacting and have no evidence of what I am about to share, in order to make a formal complaint to the C-Suite folks.

I work from our Head Office once every week (client locations on other days). I love this job, in a senior management roles, gainfully employed, for a little over a year.

Enters Male, late 50s-early 60s, also one day at the Head Office, about one month at this company. Sits next to me. Introduces, shares work background, starts to chit chat, shares that he is a divorcee twice, has a daughter few years younger than me, his mom is not good to her etc. I maintain a straight face because I am very picky with my social circle and hate unsolicited banter/ emotional dumping. 

Whenever I say something, this person says things like -
I am sure we will be great friends
We should go for coffee or lunch
I can do anything for you (flipping a plane, he has taken flying lessons)
I wouldnt believe if anyone said you are a mean girl
I cant tell you how cute you are

These are his reactions to my words that generally dont call for such a reaction. I feel like he talks to me like I am a cute child, trying to be badass but ends up being more cute. He has made an image of me in his mind where I am perfect and my poop smells like roses and loves to dwell in this world. 

Recently, I fell ill in the office (I have hypoglycemia) and sometimes get dizzy and sweat/ cold sweats. After spending 10 mins in the washroom I took my seat. He asks where were you I was worried sick. I said I am sick and sweating. He promptly puts his hand on my forehead to check if I have fever. This was uncalled for. 

As I was trying to keep myself together, he kept annoying me offering to make tea, bring meds etc. I have repeatedly told him (and everyone in my work circle) that while I am a friendly approachable person, my boundaries are strong and anyone who disrespects will be promptly cut off. He kept asking me questions (prying I would say) and would ask again and again if I stayed silent. I told him I am light headed and would appreciate not being talked to. He then kept justifying how he was only trying to take my mind off of it.

He then, while talking, grabbed my hand. When I jerked it away, he started saying how he wanted to see my tattoo and learn what it meant (my left wrist has a small tattoo, over 20 years old, not that he saw it for the first time). I was getting up to go walk outside and he wanted to join me. I said no and abruptly left. 

When I came back, he took off a ring from his ring finger and said his daughter made it for him. I said cool. He then wanted me to wear the ring to check the size of my finger so she could make me one as well. He tried to make me wear the ring with his own hand, like insert it on my finger. I said his daughter's love is for her parent and although he deserves the beautiful ring, I wont ask her to spend that time or energy for me, a non parent.

I feel like he took my sugar drop as an opportunity to play the doctor and touched me twice. Then the ring incident (on the same day). We are in Canada. He is old enough to know when sexual harassment became illegal. Was he trying to see how much I could take/ or allow him? I dont think he was checking for fever (he is not a doctor nor my doctor not wanted to see my 20 yr old plain black ink tattoo). 

The next week I sat one seat away from him and he kept on asking if he stank or if his hair was too oily or other silly things. Not once whether he madr me feel uncomfortable. He starts his babbling. At one point we discuss a new supervisor (already not so popular) and he says with a smirk - all men are pigs, repeats over me with this again and again. Felt like he was justifying his touches. 

I am not sure if he is treating me like a child as I am almost half his age. Or he is just checking how much I would allow or he could get away with. Both are worse than the other. I neither want to be patronized nor idealized/sexually harassed.

When he was newer (first or second week) he was witness to the time I told a female employee to not touch me, quiet loudly, almost screamed in anger. This girl would 'playfully' touch me (poking my butt, commenting on the good shape, my body, wanting to hangout after work etc') I had apologised to her for screaming as she has startled me but I asked that she respect my personal space. 

So this guy knows I am mindful of personal space and not a touchy feely person. Plus this is a workplace. Our big bosses are very very respectful and I have worked here for over a year, absolutely no one has made me feel uncomfortable or have my guards up so much - yes we all joke, but nothing remotely sexual or in that route. I am so comfortable here, I have even taken a nap in everyone's presence (sugar drop) and no one has spoken loudly during that time.

I dont know what to do because I feel very anxious around this person. I dont want to feel like I am overteacting but him touching me really caught me ogf guard and its bothering me.

How do I share this with my trusted boss without sounding like its my paranoia speaking or me overreacting? Also in the shortest possible way. I want this behaviour to stop.

1mfwnqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mfwnqp/bad_mouse/,Bad Mouse,"It all started on a sunny summer day in 2009 when three separate packages arrived on the doorsteps of the Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney studios. They were anonymous packages with no postmarks or return addresses. No one saw them being delivered, and each had only a simple note attached which read ‚ÄúI have created something I love. From me to you, Bad Mouse‚Äù. Strange, but the recipients decided to humor the packages anyway, thinking it was fanmail or something of the sort. When they were opened, they revealed several video tapes.



They all had titles hastily scribbled on, ‚ÄúBad Mouse: Episode 1‚Äù, ‚ÄúBad Mouse: Episode 2‚Äù, and so on. There were 13 in total, the last of which had an additional notation reading ‚ÄúThis is the last‚Äù. As to the contents of the tapes, they contained what everyone assumed to be ‚ÄúBad Mouse‚Äù, who was a mouse sock puppet, complete with two large ears, eyes, and buck teeth all clearly made with paper, but it had arms that were clearly stitched on in post and a cartoony tail that did not match the rest of the sock puppet.



All of the tapes were in black and white, and had very simple premises. In a high-pitched and nasally voice, Bad Mouse talked about numbers, the alphabet, animals, colors, and other really straightforward topics. They were only about four or five minutes long each, with no background music, title cards, or anything. Just Bad Mouse talking.



Nothing was too unusual or frightening about the ‚Äúshow‚Äù, so to speak. Clearly, it was done on a very low budget, but what exactly was the point of it? It surely would not entertain anyone over the age of three. Some dismissed it as some kind of stupid prank, while others joked that whoever delivered these tapes to the studios was banking on Bad Mouse being made into an actual show. Unfortunately, that was not how it worked, and after all the episodes were viewed and everyone got a good laugh at someone‚Äôs pitiful attempt at stardom, the episodes were all dismissed and promptly canned, though there were some who found Bad Mouse to be unsettling and creepy, but they would never bring that up in front of their colleagues.



That was supposed to be the end of it, but just one week later, more packages arrived, with the note now reading ‚ÄúFrom me to you, Bad Mouse‚Äù, the ‚ÄúI have something I love‚Äù being notably omitted. Inside the packages were 13 tapes, just like last time, and when everyone gathered to watch them, they were actually surprised. While each episode was about the same length as before, the show actually had color, plots, music, title cards, more sock puppet characters, and environments, though it was still clearly made on the smallest ounce of a budget.



The visuals and effects were shoddy at best, whoever was voicing Bad Mouse clearly voiced the other sock puppet characters, there was a strange hum of static in the background, and occasionally a loud beeping noise came from out of nowhere and bloodied the ears of all who heard it. Needless to say, it was not nearly enough to convince the executives to even fathom the idea of greenlighting it, and Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network all tossed the tapes into the garbage.



‚ÄúBad Mouse is getting desperate!‚Äù a Nickelodeon executive quipped after sipping his coffee.



Was that the end of it? Everyone thought so until another week had passed and three more packages just bearing the words ‚ÄúBad Mouse‚Äù arrived at each studio, and all three went straight to the trash can. However, a curious Cartoon Network intern secretly fished their package out of the trash. He had heard of Bad Mouse‚Äôs depravity from his colleagues, and as an avid collector of lost and unknown media on the side, this would be absolutely perfect for him. He took the tapes home and immediately popped them into his old VCR.



Judging by the small increase in quality in the second round of packages, the intern assumed that whoever was behind Bad Mouse had finally learned their lesson, but each tape showed a disturbing clip of the same thing: no color, no plots, no music, no title cards, no other characters, and no environments‚Ä¶just Bad Mouse sitting motionless and staring straight at the camera. Every thirty seconds or so, the sock puppet would say the words ‚ÄúGetting desperate‚Äù, but only in syllables:



‚ÄùGet‚Ä¶ting‚Ä¶des‚Ä¶per‚Ä¶ate‚Äù.



The intern did not scare too easily, and he did not think much of it other than it being pretty odd. Shrugging, he popped the tapes out of the old VCR, placed them with his other tapes and DVDs he had acquired throughout the years, and went to bed.



No more packages showed up after that. No more tapes. No more Bad Mouse. The whole ordeal seemed to be over‚Ä¶and it was. Until about a year later, when Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network‚Äôs channels were all hijacked.



By this point, everyone had basically forgotten about Bad Mouse. It was now just a fleeting memory of some desperate and depraved soul thinking they would make it big, something to bring up if you wanted to point and laugh. But the first signs of trouble were on Nickelodeon, specifically Nick Jr.



The characters Moose and Zee had in-between blocks where they provided information and education between shows. On the morning of July 12, 2010, a segment where Moose was supposed to teach the audience about names was hijacked by none other than Bad Mouse. In the middle of speaking, Moose went frozen and silent, the music cut out, and the screen glitched until Bad Mouse was there for the entire world to see.



Though no one watching at home could recognize what they were seeing, the network executives certainly did. Bad Mouse spoke to a bunny character (which was clearly just a stuffed animal and was aptly named ""Bunny"") about the importance of sharing. The mouse sock puppet ripped a toy truck out of Bunny's hands and ran away laughing, and Bunny just stood there, staring at the camera for about a minute. After that, it switched to a scene of Bad Mouse riding a little bike through a very poorly made cardboard field. A kindergarten play could create better sets than Bad Mouse ever could. He sang this song that sounded like complete nonsense in a voice that would make ears bleed.



""That petty asshole..."" said one network executive. It seemed that if they did not air Bad Mouse, then Bad Mouse was just going to do it themself.



The network executives were too embarrassed to simply power down the channel over what was definitely a stupid prank. They thought just slapping the technical difficulties screen on it would do the trick every time, but that did not stop Bad Mouse. For the next two weeks, all the shows on air were cut off and the broadcasts became a mess due to Bad Mouse jumbling everything up.



Bad Mouse would always return, just playing the same 13 crappy episodes on repeat. Calls were made by angry parents and their confused children, and each channel promised to resolve the issues, but they never could. While all three channels were determined to solve the issues, in the grand scheme of things, no one took them \*that\* seriously. They came off as more annoying than anything.



Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network made it absolutely clear that this was \*not\* their doing and that their broadcasts had been hijacked, and they did not know who it was or where it was coming from. With those statements out to linger in the air, the internet began to fill with rumors and speculation. Everyone was curious about the problems their children‚Äôs channels were having. There were still people assuming it was just a very clever prank and was the work of people who had nothing better to do but get a rise out of these channels and their viewers.



Others had‚Ä¶darker theories, many of them poked and made fun of for being just as stupid as Bad Mouse itself, ranging from Bad Mouse being the work of a disgruntled employee, an artificial intelligence, a paranormal phenomenon, aliens, or some kind of supernatural or superhuman entity. In today‚Äôs world, we are all pretty cynical and seem to disregard more dramatic notions because it does not align with our short-ordered view of reality.



Despite the many rumors, as July came to a close, things seemed to be getting better. By then, the executives at Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney had found a way to block out all the messaging and instead broadcast either a default bumper or a continuous feed of static for the channels until they could figure out the issue. As a result, the hijackings had slowed down significantly. They defeated Bad Mouse.



By September 1st, there was no more hijackings at all, so it seemed that Bad Mouse had simply moved on to other things. Everyone was relieved, but there was still the occasional hushed murmur that whoever was behind these hijackings would be back, because clearly, Bad Mouse seemed like a persistent weirdo. Some even went so far as to say that Bad Mouse would bring violence with it, which was laughed off as completely and utterly ridiculous.



How very wrong those people were.



For a long time, there was nothing, like before. All of it was the calm before the storm, and boy, did it storm. 2011 was coming and going with nothing unusual happening. SpongeBob cooked Krabby Patties, Mickey Mouse took us on adventures around his clubhouse, and The Amazing World of Gumball was premiering its first season to massive success. Even the once active internet forums were completely empty, with Bad Mouse just being touted as a fun, if bizarre, little piece of lost media that was stuck in the past. All was well until the summer arrived‚Ä¶



There were so many more hijackings. All three networks were affected. Instead of just being Bad Mouse episodes, they were much more...disturbing. Each one lasted anywhere from 15 minutes to a full hour, depending on the severity, and each one was worse than the last. Beginning the same way, either flickering, frames repeating themselves, sound not syncing up, waving and jittering, or random pauses, something would always happen. Sometimes the screens would be replaced with deeply disturbing edits of whatever character was on screen, often making them appear angry at the audience.



Sometimes, the screen would fade into bloodied static for a few moments, then go right back to normal programming. Sometimes random images and videos would flash on the screen, such as a pictures of the White House on fire, footage of mice, someone walking outside at night, and random YouTube videos, but there was also disturbing imagery of people being tortured, mutilated, beheaded, people being shot at point-blank range, and even all manners of illegal pornography. Sometimes, an extremely loud beeping sound would bloody the ears of all who heard it (not unlike what was head in the first Bad Mouse video tapes), blocking out everything that was being said. Sometimes vague or threatening messages were displayed such as:



‚Äúi‚Äôm here‚Äù‚Äô



‚Äúis it getting desperate?‚Äù



‚Äúi hate you all‚Äù



‚Äúi have to get attention‚Äù



‚Äúi‚Äôm desperate!‚Äù



‚Äúyou love me, but I don‚Äôt love you‚Äù



‚Äúbad mouse is getting desperate!‚Äù



‚Äúi‚Äôm going to show you the world‚Äù



‚Äúbad mouse is getting worse!‚Äù



‚Äúme me me me me me‚Äù



‚Äúattention‚Äù



Some even claimed to see images of Bad Mouse himself in the background of scenes of terror and bloodshed, though those were usually not very clear. Occasionally, a clip of Bad Mouse would be shown and then just disappear. All of this was absolutely chilling, especially considering it was shown to young children, but it was far from over. During a hijacking of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on the morning of July 25, a message from Bad Mouse claimed that August 12 would be ‚Äúdeath day‚Äù. Everyone‚Äôs blood ran cold. What did Bad Mouse mean? No one could know, but the message was already out there, so everyone braced for the worst.



Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network executives were all in a panic. They cut all broadcasts, including off-air and live shows, and immediately called up their network technicians. To everyone‚Äôs horror, the technicians were unable to locate the origin of the hijackings. They could find no source, no one was even able to log in to the programming or mess with the technical equipment, and no technician was able to determine the cause. There was no foreign software or anything of the sort.



Security cameras showed no suspicious activity. Arguments ensued, fingers were pointed, hardworking employees were fired without warning, and the situation looked grimmer and grimmer. This was an all-out war, and no one knew why it was happening or how to stop it.



By August, the situation had spiraled out of control. It was no longer just a technical issue, but an outright attack on the three major children‚Äôs networks. The situation spiraled into full chaos, with Bad Mouse still unstoppable and the networks still in chaos. By now, all the technicians who were responsible for maintaining these networks and getting them up and running had been fired, leaving all the channel‚Äôs executives at a loss of what to do. All they could do was wait and see.



On August 12, the atmospheres at the three studios were tense. They made the conscious decision to stay open, not wishing to appear weak or stupid, and wanting to show Bad Mouse that they were not afraid of it. Their broadcasts of beloved children‚Äôs shows began as normal. For a while, everything actually seemed relatively normal. No hijackings happened yet, but just as everyone at the studios were beginning to think that they might be okay, something happened, a massacre of unimaginable brutality, a tragedy of such a scale that the world would never be the same again.



In a little over half an hour, six napalm bombs went off, two at each studio. In the blink of an eye, 115 people were dead and hundreds more were injured. They came out of nowhere, with no warning, and no way to tell who, what, or where they came from. One Nickelodeon employee, Mike Ewart, was speaking with a colleague near the front doors. One moment, she was laughing and smiling, sipping her Starbucks coffee, and the next, she was completely and utterly obliterated. Ewart said that ""it was like slow motion...I saw her body just vaporize. I felt her warmth just vanish. I felt her coffee splash on me. I was just numb.‚Äù



The police found a lone Bad Mouse sock puppet lying amongst the rubble at the Disney Studio, charred and damn near impossible to identify what it even was. That was all they had to go on for physical evidence besides the bombs themselves, which were found to be homemade devices filled with both black powder and a highly flammable petrochemical substance, both of which were placed in three-gallon plastic gas containers. Each one was placed in dense areas within each target to maximize the death toll.



A task force of hundreds of police officers from all over the country and federal agencies converged on all three studios. Thousands of leads were investigated, and they all came up empty. No one saw any suspicious activity at any time in any of the studios, and no one knew who could have or would have done such a horrific thing. FBI analysts even took a look at the original tapes, the ones that were rejected by the three studios, to see if there was something they missed. Still...nothing.



All three targets were devastated, but the Nickelodeon building received the greatest damage, with three fifths of the building destroyed. Much of the buildings were rendered uninhabitable by the immense heat and force of the explosions, and while they have since been repaired and remodeled, the damaged portions have been sealed off and turned into memorials.



The perpetrator behind Bad Mouse is a mystery. No suspects or leads were ever found. Clearly, they were a lunatic with an insane dream that they wanted to see realized, who wanted to make a big impact on the world. They went off the deep end when their show was rejected. Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney all closed for months after the incident and are still getting back on their feet today.



As time went on, people began to wonder why the networks would never make a statement on the incident. Many thought that maybe it would scare everyone away from watching their programming, but there's definitely more to it than that. Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network executives were all interviewed by the press, but they were extremely vague, simply saying that they were still working on ‚Äúa little something‚Äù to pay their respects to the victims and they never commented on Bad Mouse itself.



But the scars still exist. Bad Mouse is still burned into the minds of those who lived through it, and many are too afraid to talk about it or discuss the memories they have, but a few brave souls have come forward to share their experiences through interviews and documentaries. Even the intern was interviewed, though he wished to remain anonymous.



No one knows who Bad Mouse really is, and no one ever will. People have wanted to know more about the perpetrator of such a heinous crime. It was beyond obvious what their motivations were, but the question of whoever was encrypted as Bad Mouse, much like Jack the Ripper and the Zodiac Killer, will simply never be known.

1mfwn1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1mfwn1k/how_to_overcome_feelings_of_shame_and_ptsd_from/,How to overcome feelings of shame and PTSD from sexual coercion and complex relationship trauma from 4 years ago,"Hi everyone,

To preface, I (24F) am in therapy (EMDR) and have been going for about a year, but I feel really stuck with feelings of trauma, flashbacks, nightmares, and chest tightness. I recently got married two months ago to my wonderful husband, but have so much guilt from past relationship trauma. 

I‚Äôve been trying to work through some deeply painful memories and guilt related to past relationships that still haunt me. One area where my PTSD symptoms show up most intensely is in the way I process my sexual and emotional past ‚Äî especially two key relationships with people I‚Äôll call Ethan and Charlie.

Ethan was my boyfriend when I was in college (18-21). We met online during Covid, and he was from Europe. We got to know each other online for a year before I was accepted to a study abroad program in his home country for a semester. I deliberately applied to this program to be in the same country for our relationship. When I moved for that semester, I didn‚Äôt know anyone and quickly made me feel isolated. All of a sudden, Ethan become emotionally distant, often left me alone, and I later discovered he was messaging other women online behind my back. I often paid for everything (groceries, plane tickets, gifts). I felt abandoned and unimportant, but he always told me he was doing nothing wrong and I expected too much. At the time, I still desperately craved his approval and presence, even though I knew deep down something wasn‚Äôt right. He was about three years older than me and was my first serious relationship. 

During that relationship and semester abroad, I became friends with a man (who we will call Charlie) who approached me in a coffee shop. Looking back, I now realize Charlie was also emotionally manipulative and at times abusive - he followed me around the city and pressured me to see him for dinner, studying, etc. I didn‚Äôt have the words for it then. I never felt fully safe around him, but I also felt pressured ‚Äî like saying no to him physically wasn‚Äôt an option. Ethan forbade me from seeing Charlie, however I had no other friends and was struggling on my own in the city. I ended up having a relationship with Charlie behind Ethan‚Äôs back, even though I did not really want to. One night Charlie walked me back to my student accommodation and kissed me, and I did not have the words to stop it. I thought that would be it. However, during my last month studying abroad Charlie came over to my room for dinner and made physical advances towards me that led to sex. I thought, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just do whatever Charlie wants so he won‚Äôt hurt me and no one will ever have to know.‚Äù

I continued my relationship with Ethan for a year afterwards having never told him or anyone else what had happened. We finally broke up after I paid $5,000 for him to get a medical procedure done, took care of him, and found out he was sexting other women again and looking up escorts. The relationship ended with him refusing to leave me alone and a lot of screaming and crying on his part. 

At the time, the Charlie situation exited my mind like nothing ever happened until all of these memories came flooding back about a year and a half ago. When they did, I reached out to Ethan and told him everything, and all he asked was ‚Äúdo I need to get tested?‚Äù, told me to mail his tshirt back from years ago, and ‚Äúbeing angry at you does not serve me.‚Äù It was very cold. 

Two months ago, Charlie reached out to me again with a message that reopened all of this. He told me that I needed to apologize to Ethan for cheating and said I had treated Ethan horribly. This wrecked me. All the guilt I had shoved down came roaring back, and I felt like I was a fundamentally broken, selfish person who only causes pain.

But part of what makes this so complicated is that I was also in pain. I was young, unsupported, and scared. I know I made mistakes. But I also know now that both of these men hurt me, used me, and contributed to the shame I carry today. I feel like I need Ethan‚Äôs forgiveness again, even though I‚Äôve already apologized, and I don‚Äôt even know how to forgive myself. 

I‚Äôm married now to a loving and safe person, but sometimes I still feel like I don‚Äôt deserve love or joy. I feel ‚Äútainted‚Äù by what happened ‚Äî like my sexual past defines me, like I can‚Äôt trust myself, like I‚Äôm dirty and unforgivable. I struggle with intimacy, and my body experiences a lot of pain and flashbacks during it.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? How do you begin to believe you are worthy of healing after a past like this?

If you‚Äôre constantly having to do that many chores around the house, then you suck at cleaning or you‚Äôre filthy.

Cleaning the bathroom? 15 minutes max. 

Dishes? Cleaning the kitchen? 30 minutes max, not including the time it takes for the washing machine to finish. 

Cook dinner? Hour max.

I used to play 7 fortune frenzy and had alot of money into this game one day while in the middle of a spin before the play was over and I even knew the result of my spin I got kicked out of the game and I could not get back in,  at all. And to this day, I still have not been able to get back in. I have contacted customer service through chat sent emails, and they tell me its fixed and its not. I requested my game play transactions from this showing the win or lose from the the plays that day and especially the play I was in the middle of when I was abruptly kicked out, because if it was a win I couldn't log back in to claim it and if you dont its forfeited after so many days, and bovada knows this. Its been months, and despite them saying its fixed its not, was. Was it a win, and thats why they did this?? I keep asking, and nothing.
 Fast forward to yesterday 07/31/2025-08/01/2025 I now am playing 88 fortune frenzy because im still blocked from 7 frenzy I get 2 good hits the last was for $800 brings my balance to $2,100 I set my phone down to get some coffee for 3 minutes come back hit the spin button 3 times and notice my balance says $990 there is no damn way! I email customer service because it's just not possible. I feel like I need to look into this. I ask for them to send me my game play so I can do a deep scan to make sure everything is correct. They not only are not responding, but I am now blocked from 88 fortune frenzy as well and getting the same pop up as 7 frenzy. Friends, this has me feeling all types of uneasy.

Im not a chump we either both get to eat lobster and drink wine, or im out. I won't pay for you to put me out. And nobody is going to get away with stealing from me. Bovada may be off shore, but that doesn't mean they can't be held accountable if they choose to conduct themselves poorly in how they do business. Im not legal either, and neither was Al Copone or Tony Montana look what happene when they got stolen from. We have transacted over a million dollars in business Bovada, kindly respond to my emails, and let's get this straightened out.  Let's say ( and I am truly hoping It does not get to this point as even with this happening, I am struggling to think my trusted sportsbook is up to shysty stuff and this is the fault of the game developer. Bovada will catch it and return any missing funds or winnings of spins unaccounted for and all will be marry) but if And Its a big IF its the other way around I have put a bug in the ear of my attorney and my CPA and all the other people I would need. However, I have agreed to pay Noone yet. And your attorney isnt your attorney until you put him on the clock.

From brewing early morning essentials to hosting family gatherings, this carafe has seen its share of coffee escapades. I appreciated the opportunity to test its features, but like any product, it comes with both highlights and areas worth discussing.

**Design and Build**  
The moment I unboxed this replacement carafe, its premium feel immediately caught my attention. Constructed from durable glass with a stylish black lid and brushed chrome handle, it complements both modern and classic kitchen decor seamlessly. The ergonomic handle is a particularly thoughtful addition; even when I‚Äôm juggling tasks, it‚Äôs never slipped from my grip. Its dimensions ‚Äì 8.3 inches wide and 7.25 inches high ‚Äì make it quite sizable without feeling cumbersome. The round shape is not only aesthetically pleasing but functional too, allowing it to sit snugly in the coffee maker. Moreover, the brewer markings for 2-14 cups are surprisingly accurate. I found this feature especially helpful during hectic mornings when precision matters.  

[Check Cuisinart DCC-2200RC price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b000pj6nwu/)  

**Functionality and Ease of Use**  
This carafe isn't just about looks; its performance certainly holds its own. Compatible with popular models like the DCC-2200, DCC-2600, and a few more, it's clearly designed with adaptability in mind. Filling the carafe felt effortless, thanks to the dripless spout and well-thought-out lid. I‚Äôve struggled with carafes in the past that leave trails of coffee on the counter, but that hasn‚Äôt been an issue here. Additionally, it was refreshing to see that the knuckle guard provided extra assurance, reducing risks during quick grabs.  

**Durability and Maintenance**  
One of my concerns before using a replacement glass carafe was whether it‚Äôd withstand daily wear and tear. Surprisingly, this model has held up well. It‚Äôs light enough to handle comfortably but doesn‚Äôt feel fragile. Washing it is straightforward too‚Äîrinse it in warm soap water, or pop it into the dishwasher's upper rack for hands-free convenience. That said, I do have to be cautious to avoid any hard knocks, as its glass construction, while robust, isn‚Äôt shatterproof.  

**Benefits**  
The positives I‚Äôve noticed in the Cuisinart replacement carafe are worth highlighting:  
- Sleek and modern appearance enhances the coffee corner.  
- Ergonomic handle provides comfort, even during extended usage.  
- Compatible with multiple coffeemaker models for versatile use.  
- Brewer markings make it easy to measure perfect amounts.  

**Areas of Concern**  
That being said, a few hurdles came up during testing:  
- The glass, although sturdy, could be prone to breaking if mishandled.  
- No thermal insulation, meaning coffee cools down quicker than in thermal carafes.  

**Value for Money**  
From a pricing perspective, this glass carafe hits the sweet spot between quality and cost-efficiency. It may not be the cheapest option out there, but its features, compatibility, and build justify the investment. For someone who uses coffee makers frequently (ahem, guilty), this replacement carafe feels like a valuable addition to the kitchen setup. Still, if you‚Äôre seeking something with heat retention, it might be worth considering alternatives in the stainless-steel range.  

**Direct Competitors**  
When comparing this Cuisinart carafe to competitors, such as the Hamilton Beach and Mr. Coffee replacement carafes, some differences stand out. While the Hamilton Beach carafes often boast higher heat retention with their thermal options, they lack the same stylistic elegance. Mr. Coffee alternatives, while budget-friendly, don‚Äôt quite compare in terms of compatibility or ergonomic detailing. The Cuisinart option, therefore, strikes a great balance of aesthetic style paired with functional versatility, even if you do have to occasionally deal with faster cooling.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Choosing a home in a rural area often comes with the desire for charm and comfort while being practical. For many, a 24x40 steel cabin kit combines both of these elements perfectly. Steel cabin kits are becoming increasingly popular in rural settings due to their durability and affordability. Here‚Äôs why opting for a 24x40 steel cabin kit can be a wise decision.

### Durability and Strength

One of the most compelling reasons to select a 24x40 steel cabin kit is its remarkable durability. Steel structures are designed to withstand harsh weather conditions, including heavy winds, snow, and rain. Unlike traditional wooden cabins, which may rot, warp, or attract pests over time, steel cabins offer longevity that ensures your investment remains solid for years.

### Energy Efficiency

Steel cabin kits can be highly energy efficient. Insulation options can easily be integrated, keeping your home warm during cold winters and cool in the summer. This efficiency can lead to lower heating and cooling bills, making it not only a cozy place to live but also a financially sound choice.

### Quick and Easy Assembly

Another significant benefit is the ease of assembly. Most 24x40 steel cabin kits come with pre-cut materials and clear instructions, making the building process straightforward. Whether you choose to build it yourself or hire a contractor, the construction time is typically much shorter than that of traditional homes. This means you can quickly start enjoying your new cozy metal home.

### Cost-Effectiveness

Building a home can be a hefty financial undertaking. Fortunately, 24x40 steel cabin kits are a cost-effective alternative to traditional building materials. The initial cost is lower, and you can save on maintenance and repair costs in the long run. Additionally, as property values in rural areas continue to rise, your investment in a steel cabin kit is likely to appreciate over time.

### Customizable Design

With a 24x40 steel cabin kit, you have the freedom to customize your living space according to your needs and tastes. From choosing the layout to selecting finishes, the possibilities are extensive. This flexibility allows you to design a cozy home that reflects your personality while maximizing the use of the space available.

### Eco-Friendly Option

Many people are becoming more environmentally conscious, and opting for a steel cabin kit aligns with that goal. Steel is a recyclable material, and using it to build your cabin means you are participating in sustainable building practices. Furthermore, the energy efficiency of these homes can lead to a smaller carbon footprint compared to traditional construction methods.

### Safety and Security

Safety is a priority for any homeowner. Steel cabins stand up better during emergencies, such as fires or storms, compared to wooden structures. The steel construction limits the potential for fire hazards, and its robust nature provides a safe environment for you and your loved ones. Additionally, steel is resistant to pests, which provides peace of mind when it comes to the integrity of your home.

### Minimal Maintenance Requirements

Life in rural areas often comes with the appeal of simplicity and fewer responsibilities. A 24x40 steel cabin kit contributes to this lifestyle by requiring minimal maintenance. Unlike wooden cabins that may need constant upkeep or treatment against rot and pests, steel cabins typically only require occasional washing to maintain their appearance.

- Durable and long-lasting
- Energy-efficient design
- Quick assembly process
- Cost-effective investment
- Customizable living space
- Eco-friendly building material
- Increased safety and security
- Low maintenance requirements

A 24x40 steel cabin kit is an ideal choice for those looking to embrace rural living. Not only does it provide comfort and a welcoming atmosphere, but it does so at a fraction of the cost and hassle of traditional homes. If you‚Äôre considering a cozy metal home for your next peaceful getaway, a steel cabin kit is a practical option worth exploring.

Tips for Personalizing Your 24x40 Steel Cabin Kit to Suit Your Lifestyle
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Embracing rural living with a 24x40 steel cabin kit can be an exciting adventure, allowing you to create a cozy haven tailored to your personal lifestyle. Personalizing your steel cabin transforms it from a mere structure into a cherished home. With some thoughtful planning and creativity, you can customize your cabin in ways that reflect your tastes and meet your needs.

One of the most important aspects of personalizing your steel cabin is choosing the right layout. The 24x40 floor plan offers ample space to include all of your desired features. Consider dividing the space into distinct areas to suit specific activities. For example, you might want a cozy living area for relaxation, a functional kitchen for meal prep, and a multi-purpose room that can serve as an office or guest space. Utilizing open-concept designs can make the cabin feel even more spacious and inviting.

### Color and Exterior Finishes

Enhancing the exterior of your cabin is essential for creating your unique style. The color scheme can dramatically transform its appearance. Consider these tips:

- **Choose from a Palette:** Select colors that harmonize with your surroundings. Earthy tones like greens and browns blend beautifully into rural settings, while bright colors can stand out and make a statement.
- **Rustic Touches:** wooden elements or stone accents on your cabin‚Äôs facade can add a rustic charm and break away from the steel‚Äôs industrial feel.
- **Landscaping:** Invest time in landscaping your cabin‚Äôs surroundings. Adding flower beds, shrubs, or even vegetable gardens can create a welcoming entryway.

### Interior Layout Designs

Once outside your cabin looks inviting, it‚Äôs time to focus on the interior. How you arrange your living space is just as important as the exterior. Here are some ideas:

- **Room Separation:** Use furniture or decorative screens to segment areas within the open floor plan, allowing for privacy without closing off the space completely.
- **Multi-Functional Furniture:** Opt for furniture that serves multiple purposes, such as sofa beds or storage ottomans. This helps maximize space without sacrificing comfort.
- **Personal Touches:** Incorporate artwork, photographs, or handmade crafts that resonate with you. Personalizing your space with items that carry memories adds character.

### Energy Efficiency and Sustainability

Personalizing your 24x40 steel cabin kit doesn‚Äôt stop at aesthetic choices; you can also focus on energy efficiency. Integrating eco-friendly features can enhance your living experience.

- **Insulation:** Proper insulation helps maintain a comfortable temperature year-round, reducing energy costs and your carbon footprint.
- **Solar Panels:** Consider installing solar panels on your cabin's roof. Harnessing renewable energy can enhance your cabin‚Äôs sustainability and save on electricity bills.
- **Water Conservation:** Implement rainwater collection systems or low-flow fixtures to conserve water and promote sustainability.

### Smart Technology Implementation

Modern technology can also play a significant role in personalizing your cabin. Smart devices can improve comfort and convenience:

- **Smart Thermostats:** These can adjust heating and cooling according to your schedule, ensuring your cabin is always at the right temperature.
- **Security Systems:** Install smart locks, cameras, and alarm systems to keep your retreat safe while you enjoy your rural lifestyle.
- **Lighting Control:** Smart lighting gives you the ability to control brightness and colors, creating the perfect mood for every occasion.

The beauty of a 24x40 steel cabin kit lies in its versatility. Whether it's the colors you choose, the layout you design, or the eco-friendly features you implement, every choice shapes your home into a reflection of yourself. Take the time to think about what you truly want in your space, and don‚Äôt hesitate to get creative. Your cabin can be a comfortable, stylish, and unique retreat that meets all your lifestyle needs.

By following these tips and strategies, you can turn your steel cabin kit into a home that fosters comfort and warmth, enabling you to enjoy all the benefits of rural living.

### Conclusion

Choosing a 24x40 steel cabin kit is a smart decision for those seeking cozy metal homes in rural areas. These kits not only provide a solid and durable structure but also offer the flexibility and space needed for modern living. With their energy efficiency and low maintenance requirements, they are perfect for anyone looking to embrace a simpler, more sustainable lifestyle. Imagine sipping your morning coffee on the porch of your very own steel cabin, surrounded by nature, enjoying the peace that rural living brings.

Personalizing your steel cabin kit allows you to truly make it feel like home. Whether it‚Äôs customizing the interior layout, picking out colors, or adding outdoor features, these choices allow you to reflect your personality and lifestyle. Consider your needs and what will make your living space comfortable and functional. Think about incorporating energy-efficient appliances, sustainable materials, or even smart home technologies that can enhance your experience.

As you embark on the journey of building your 24x40 steel cabin, remember that it‚Äôs not just about the structure itself; it‚Äôs about creating a space that nurtures your well-being and aligns with your values. With careful planning and thoughtful customization, your steel cabin can become a sanctuary that provides comfort, joy, and a genuine connection to the rural landscape. Embrace the opportunity to craft a unique living environment that serves you and your family for years to come. Your cozy metal home awaits!",1,1754156572.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

1mfwfpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mfwfpu/hr_the_photo_from_the_estate_sale/,[HR] The Photo From the Estate Sale,"The girl in the photo on the wall blinked. She tried to pretend she didn‚Äôt see it, but she did. ‚ÄúCome on, Joy‚Äù, she muttered to herself. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going crazy. It‚Äôs just a photo.‚Äù Joy paced in her living room, shaky hand on her glass full of scotch, and swallows a gulp. Her black cat, Cheshire, perched on its cat tree, staring at her in fascination.

Joy took a deep breath. ‚ÄúOk,‚Äù, she said. ‚ÄúI can do this‚Äù. She steeled her nerves by downing the rest of her drink, and she set it on the coffee table‚Äîbut she missed the edge and it fell off, clattering on the hardwood floor. Joy flinched at the sound, but refused to look at it, worried that she‚Äôd lose her nerve.

She turned to the photo and walked up to it in trepidation. The photo was a picture of a girl in a cemetery, staring mournfully over a headstone and looking directly at the viewer. She was pretty, auburn hair, maybe mid 20‚Äôs, wearing a long black peacoat over what appeared to be slacks and a cream-colored blouse. Joy leaned in a bit, eyeing the woman‚Äôs necklace. It was beautiful, on a seemingly silver (or platinum) chain, with a pentacle in stylized metal vines hanging from it, blood red jewels at every point of the star.

Joy took a deep breath, ran her fingers through her raven black bob, and looked into the woman‚Äôs green eyes in the photo, and she said ‚ÄúOk. I‚Äôm looking right at you. Do it. NOW. Prove I‚Äôm not going crazy! Blink dammit‚Äù, Joy screamed in frustration. And as she stared at the photo, tears rising in her eyes, the girl slowly blinked.

Joy gasped and fell backwards, landing on the glass that fell & shattered it, startling Cheshire, who bolted for the safety of the bedroom. But she couldn't look away. She got to her feet, ignoring the cuts on her arm from the broken glass. Despite her best judgement, she approached the painting, trying to ignore the mounting terror in her body that was screaming at her to run, or, at least, burn the damn thing.

Inching up to the painting, Joy searched the other girl‚Äôs face. Her expression in the photo hadn‚Äôt changed... but then she blinked again. Joy felt a chill run down her spine, but she also felt a bit of triumph. Joy had been a practicing Wiccan for fifteen of her twenty-seven years, but she had never truly experienced anything supernatural or magical... well, that she knew of. ‚ÄúI knew it‚Äù Joy whispered. ‚ÄúThere IS something else out there!‚Äù

‚ÄúI picked your photo up from an estate sale,‚Äù Joy said to the girl in the photo. ‚ÄúI liked the look... it seemed fitting for my little apartment. But I didn‚Äôt choose you, did?‚Äù she mused. ‚ÄúYou... chose me...‚Äù. The girl blinked slowly again. Joy let out a little squeal of delight and rushed up right next to the photo.

‚ÄúYou can UNDERSTAND me, can‚Äôt you?! If you‚Äôre able, blink twice for yes, once for no.‚Äù June waited with baited breath as the girl slowly blinked once... and then again, back to back. ‚ÄúAre you alive?‚Äù Joy queried. Two slow blinks in response. ‚ÄúThen you must be trapped, right?‚Äù Yet again, two blinks. ‚ÄúHow were you trapped?!‚Äù Joy eagerly said. One blink in response.

Joy pouted a moment, when it struck her. ‚ÄúOh, that wasn‚Äôt a yes or no question! I‚Äôm so sorry. Are you... cursed?‚Äù Two blinks in response. ‚ÄúDid you influence me to pick you up at the estate sale because you think I can help you?‚Äù This time, the girl blinked twice, much faster. Joy looked elated for a second, then doubt crept in. ‚ÄúBut... I‚Äôve never successfully cast a spell. At least, not that I know of. You know I don‚Äôt know real magic, right?‚Äù Two slow blinks this time... odd, Joy thought.

‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs still something I can do?‚Äù Joy asked. Two rapid blinks. Cheshire yowled in the background, reminding Joy that it was past suppertime. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back in a bit!‚Äù Joy exclaimed, excited for the mystery. ‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt worry! I swear I‚Äôll help you, even if it‚Äôs the last thing I do!‚Äù She rushed off to open a can of cat food for her demanding feline master. After a second or two, the girl in the photo blinked twice again.

\*\*\*\*\*

Joy rushed into the apartment, arms full of tote bags carrying books. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got it!‚Äù She shouts to the painting, oblivious as to whether or not the girl in the photo can hear her. ‚ÄúI went to the old bookstore down on Main Street and grabbed everything I could find on curses or bindings. The guy owning the shop was SO helpful, but a bit nosy.‚Äù she babbled. Joy staggers into the living room and drops her bags next to the coffee table, then turns to the photo triumphantly. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôll be able to find something to help you!‚Äù Joy effuses. Two rapid blinks. ‚ÄúWow, you‚Äôre getting faster at that!‚Äù Joy marveled. Two more blinks. Joy pulls a dusty grimoire out of one of her totes and says ‚ÄúBetter get started! Who knows how long this will take.‚Äù Joy immediately buries her nose in the book and doesn‚Äôt notice the girl blink twice.

\*\*\*\*\*

**One Week Later**

‚ÄúAHA!‚Äù Joy screeches, scaring Cheshire, who once again scampers off to the safety of the bedroom. ‚ÄúI found an incantation that is supposed to work on curses! I‚Äôve got all the stuff here to try it,‚Äù Joy said eagerly. She ran around the apartment, gathering her wiccan supplies, and set up a makeshift altar on her living room table. ‚ÄúSorry, Cheshire,‚Äù Joy says regretfully, ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt know what's going to happen, and I don‚Äôt want you getting hurt.‚Äù Joy thinks for a second and sends a text to her best friend, asking her that if she doesn‚Äôt hear from her in a day, to come over, let herself in, and feed Cheshire. The friend texted back immediately, worried, but Joy was too eager to respond; her friend was a worrywart, after all.

Having lit all the candles, Joy picks up the grimoire and recites the simple spell:

*‚ÄúOne above all*

*This person has been defiled*

*Please release her from these bonds*

*And right the wrong once wreaked.‚Äù*

Ok, Joy thought, now I just have to touch the photo as the final step. Joy reaches forward and lays her right hand on the painting, smiling at the girl. Suddenly, there‚Äôs a flash of light, then darkness.

After a few seconds, Joy can see the auburn-haired woman in front of her. Joy tried to smile and greet her, but finds herself curiously unable to move. She realizes that the woman is in her apartment, but where is she...? She looks down, and sees a gravestone that reads:

***Joy Schwartz***

***July 18th 1998-October 31st, 2025***

‚ÄòBut... that‚Äôs today‚Äôs date,‚Äô Joy thinks. She looks back up to see the auburn-haired woman smile cruelly at her and walk out of view.

1mfwfis,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1mfwfis/does_waterdrop_wdf07_refrigerator_water_filter/,Does Waterdrop WD-F07 Refrigerator Water Filter Deliver Superior Filtration? In-depth Review,"I‚Äôve been using the Waterdrop WD-F07 Refrigerator Water Filter every day for the past few months, and I‚Äôve got a lot to say about it. This product, officially known as the Waterdrop UKF8001, is marketed as a replacement for popular refrigerator water filters like Whirlpool‚Äôs EveryDrop Filter 4 and Maytag UKF8001AXX models. As someone who‚Äôs exceptionally picky about the quality of water in my home, testing this filter felt like kicking off a mini science experiment, and I‚Äôve been pleased overall‚Äîbut there are certainly a few quirks to discuss.

**Design and Installation Made Simple**  
One thing immediately stood out to me: the design. Compact and lightweight at 0.69 pounds, this filter is a breeze to handle and install. Dimensions are 2.32"" x 2.32"" x 8.03"", so it fits snugly into my Maytag refrigerator without any awkward fiddling. Not to mention, completely tool-free installation is a win in my book. I set it up in less than five minutes while my skeptical spouse supervised, only to later ask me how it went in so effortlessly. Bonus points come from the included month-install stickers, which are surprisingly handy for someone like me who forgets when I last replaced a filter.

Want to see if the **Waterdrop WD-F07 Refrigerator Water Filter** suits your fridge? [Check price and availability on Amazon now.](https://usedwater.com/price/b01cc83yc8/)  

**Filtration Performance and Water Quality**  
This filter promises to reduce all the scary-sounding stuff in your water, such as chlorine, heavy metals, and volatile organic compounds. I admit, I was skeptical at first. Living in an area where tap water often has a metallic aftertaste, I noticed an immediate and impressive improvement. The Sri Lankan coconut shell carbon block that they hype in the product description? Let me just say‚Äîit‚Äôs not marketing fluff. Not only does it eliminate the bitterness in my water, but it also retains the minerals necessary for great taste. My coffee tasted noticeably better, and even the family pets seem to prefer their water since the switch.

**Strengths**  
- Produces crisp, great-tasting water, significantly better than previous filters I‚Äôve used.  
- Quick and easy installation process without the need for tools.  
- High compatibility with a wide range of refrigerator models.  
- NSF certifications inspire confidence about safety and effectiveness.

**Key Hurdles**  
- Despite being efficient, the filter needs to be flushed with about 2.5 gallons of water upon first use. Not a big deal, but if you weren‚Äôt prepared, you might be startled by sputtering from the dispenser.  
- Some users reported minor water flow issues with older refrigerators. I didn‚Äôt experience this directly, but it could be worth considering if you‚Äôre pairing the filter with an older unit.

**Durability and Maintenance Consistency**  
Once installed and flushed, the filter delivers consistent performance for around 300 gallons or six months, depending on your water usage. I tested this with a family of four, and even when running the dispenser heavily (read: multiple glasses of water daily, coffee-brewing marathons, plus the occasional stock pot filling), the flow and taste remained steady. The filter comes with a clever month-sticker system for staying on track with replacements‚Äîthough I wish the packaging were clearer about how to dispose of the used filter sustainably.

**Alternative Offerings**  
Compared to competitors, the Waterdrop WD-F07 holds its own well. Take Whirlpool‚Äôs EveryDrop Filter 4, for instance. While the brand-name option is highly reliable, it‚Äôs also significantly pricier. Meanwhile, budget filters like Crystala Filters CF5 often lack certifications like NSF, leaving doubts about safety. The Waterdrop hits a sweet spot by pairing professional-grade filtration (thank you, coconut-shell-carbon magic!) with affordability. The only chink in its armor might be slightly slower water flow compared to premium-market leaders.

**Bang for the Buck**  
When considering overall cost-effectiveness, this filter packs a punch. It gives top-tier filtration without throwing your budget into turmoil. I researched similar products extensively, and many options at this price point lack certifications or fail to maintain consistent water quality over time. Would I buy this again? Absolutely. It manages to balance quality with affordability far better than many of its market peers.

Weekends seem to fly by faster than a Red Bull on a straightaway, don't they? How about we put the brakes on the usual routine, step out of our comfort zones (and maybe our race-day pajamas), and do something exhilaratingly different?

The Starting Grid: Our Day's Itinerary

Let's kick things off with a visit to a quirky caf√© or perhaps an arcade ‚Äì where we can fuel up or unleash our competitive spirits like undercover racers. From there, we'll navigate the Bangalore traffic (our very own street circuit!) and head to a screening of an F1 movie. We can dissect the racing lines, critique the CGI, and secretly rate the authenticity of the engine sounds like seasoned commentators.

Victory Lap: Beyond the Credits 
If the conversation‚Äôs still flowing after the credits roll, who knows‚Äîmaybe we can find a spot for some late-night ice cream, a debrief over coffee, or even a spontaneous detour to discuss our favorite moments, rounding off the day just right.

The Driver's Profile: About Me
I'm 26, a tech guy, a semi-professional overthinker, and a full-time curious soul. I'm into swimming, spontaneous treks, and exploring caf√©s that look like they were built for rainy days and long chats. On weekends, I alternate between doing absolutely nothing and everything at once ‚Äì much like a qualifying lap!

**Dinner dates?** Sleeves cuffed, one button undone, paired with a chain‚Äî**instant charisma**.

It worked for rooftop parties, farmers‚Äô markets, beach strolls, and brunch alike. The **lightweight linen** allowed airflow, so no sweaty back or sticky arms‚Äî**just cool, dry comfort**.

# üß∫ Wash & Repeat: Still Looks Sharp

Worried about wrinkles or shrinkage? Noah washed it cold, hang-dried it, and:

* The **fit stayed consistent**
* The **colors didn‚Äôt fade**
* The fabric softened slightly‚Äî**becoming even more breathable over time**

It looked like he paid double the price at a boutique. But nope‚Äî**affordable luxury, Lucky Brand style**.

* The **V-neck** was perfectly cut‚Äî**sharp and flattering**, but not too deep.
* The **fitted design hugged his arms and chest** just right, giving him that athletic silhouette.
* And the fabric? **Soft. Stretchy. Lightweight.** Like it was made to move with him‚Äînot against him.

Suddenly, this wasn‚Äôt just another t-shirt. It was a confidence booster.

# üå§Ô∏è Everyday Style: From Coffee to Cocktails

**Afternoon video call?** Threw on a jacket over it‚Äîstill sharp and structured.

What he loved most? He could **dress it up or down**, and the **stretch never sagged**, even after a long day.

1mfw64v,https://www.reddit.com/r/scds/comments/1mfw64v/undiagnosed_from_the_specialist_in_indiana/,"Undiagnosed from ""THE Specialist"" in Indiana","I'm at my wits end. I've been dealing with terrible tinnitus for about 2 years.  It.does.not.stop. It is incredibly loud and one tone but occasionally I'll get a second or third tone that's higher and/or lower pitched. In addition to that I've been dealing with awful headaches, probably for about a decade or more,  which I chalked up to my sinus & allergy issues. I had two balloon sinuplasties and a eustachian tube dilation, which got rid of my seasonal sinus/ear infections and most of the sinus pressure.

 I began to suspect I had a CSF leak because my ENT said my sinuses are as wide as they can be and are not inflamed or occluded. I get terrible pressure throughout the top and back of my head but it will get very intense behind my ears inside and the bridge of my nose.  When I'm lucky, the pressure will release and make a sound.  None of the doctors I've seen have noted this as significant but like...why does my head make a clicking, knocking, squeaking, sound that's audible to other people when a lot of pressure releases and my cats have also heard it and been quite alarmed. After this pressure releases, a bit of fluid will drip into my ear canal and nose (if the pressure goes to the nose), but it's not been enough to collect to confirm its CSF because it's only a drop or two from each location. It doesn't smell or taste of anything and it evaporates very quickly. It only happens when I'm lying down or if the pressure is just so high that when I'm sitting up it will very rarely release. Oftentimes it will release and then become more pressurized attempting to release more pressure. It's like it's trying to let in air like when you're trying to pour ketchup from a glass bottle but the air doesn't want to go in and the ketchup doesn't want to come out.  

As to the SCDS, I had a CT scan where a neurologist found the dehiscence and referred me to a neurosurgeon who also confirmed the tegmen dehiscence & said they could do a resurfacing but we would need to also find the CSF leak because if there's still a leak, my symptoms will not get better.  He sent me to Dr Nelson of IU to consult because they do the surgery together. Dr Nelson said he doesn't see a tegmen dehiscence and that my symptoms do not align with scds because i am constantly incredibly dizzy and it gets worse when i bend over or stand up.  He said that he ""sees a lot of these scans"" and he doesn't see any brain sagging or fluid in the inner ear,  though the radiologist noted occlusion in the mastoid air cells, so ok.  He told me I'm *the* demographic for a spontaneous CSF leak because I'm a middle aged overweight woman (but then called me severely obese in the clinical notes, which is true but like...rude). I was left without any answers and had a follow-up with Dr. Patra, the neurosurgeon who now upon consultation with Dr. Nelson is stressing ""weight management"" and PT. He wants me to work with a dietician to lose weight. Like I can do that when I can't move.  It's gotten so bad that over the last year I have slowly stopped being able to do things and I only bend over to feed my cats and the feral colony I take care of and to pet the friendly ones because it's all the affection they will get all day, and now I need to sit in a chair to be able to pet the colony cats and I've told my partner that it's time to get a coffee table to put our indoor cats food on because even bending over to do that once a day makes me disoriented for hours. I've described it like my head is a snowglobe and if I sit really really still for a long time, the swirling will almost stop (but we're still in room that's rotating) but if I stand or bend over the particles go and there's nothing I can do about it but lay down or just sit very very still.  That makes me nauseous plus my diabetes meds make me hate food sometimes, so how exactly am I supposed to lose weight. Find me a dietician who can work with someone with extreme executive dysfunction and can only eat what she can grab ready-to-eat out of the fridge or cupboard with no extra steps like putting it in the microwave or spreading something. Plus they need to also be able to figure out wtf I'm going to do when no food sounds appetizing. Usually I go with a bolthouse farms protein shake but I can't do that for every meal. 

Anyway sorry for the rant.  I'm thinking I need to get a second opinion back at Community Hospital Network which is by my house and perhaps I won't deal with fatphobia from their neurosurgeons. Unfortunately if they think there's a tegmen dehiscence, I think Dr. Nelson is the only one in the state that does resurfacing... so I'm back at square 1. ",1,1754155640.0,scds,3,1.0,False

Then like 3 months ago I started to worry our training was going backwards because I just could not get him to do engage and disengage, he wasn't listening to commands on walks, and when we went to the coffee shop he wouldn't sit or lay down like he usually would and I was so confused because as far as I was aware I was doing things how I usually did them. This has been a pain in my ass the last few months and while it hasn't been too bad in the sense he isn't lunging or barking it still sucked because we weren't improving and basic things he was doing before he just didn't want to do now.

Today had been the coolest day in months and I actually had my ADHD ass organized and had time to cut up cheese for him to take on our walk.

1mfw0gt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mfw0gt/investigate_if_the_mr_coffee_12cup_coffee_maker/,Investigate if the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Coffee Maker Lives Up to Its Promise,"Testing the Mr. Coffee SK13-RB 12-Cup Coffee Maker was an intriguing experience for me, considering my personal devotion to starting mornings with a perfectly brewed cup of coffee. If you're someone who can't function without caffeine, this coffee maker might just be what you need in your kitchen. With clean lines, an efficient design, and intuitive functionality, it looks like a worthy companion for daily coffee indulgence. Let me share my thoughts on how this machine performed in my day-to-day routine.

**Design and Build Quality**

This coffee maker is no frills, but that's part of its charm. Encased in a sleek black body, it exudes a classic look that fits well in almost any kitchen. It doesn‚Äôt take over the counter either, as it measures 11.76"" by 12.3"" by 13.8"". Lightweight at just 3.6 pounds, I found it convenient to move around during deep cleaning days. While the plastic build might not scream high-end, it feels sturdy enough for daily use. I particularly appreciated the frustration-free packaging it arrived in; everything was snug and secure without unnecessary layers.

**Ease of Use and Features**

Operating this coffee maker was straightforward, even on groggy mornings. The intuitive button interface made the brewing process simple. The Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause feature stood out; there were times when I couldn‚Äôt wait for the full pot to brew, and this feature allowed me to sneak a cup without any mess. The on/off indicator light was a helpful touch, serving as a reminder to turn it off‚Äîbecause let's face it, I've forgotten to do that more often than I‚Äôd like to admit.

**Performance and Brewing Experience**

When it came to the actual coffee, I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. The machine delivers rich-tasting brews, whether you're preparing a single cup or 12 servings for a family brunch. The reusable basket filter, which lifts out easily, made refilling coffee grounds and cleaning a breeze. It‚Äôs a drip coffee machine through and through, so those who love the classic bold flavors of filter coffee will be pleased. However, coffee enthusiasts seeking advanced brewing settings or espresso-style results may need to look elsewhere.

[Find the best price for Mr. Coffee SK13-RB on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b002yi2ig0/)

**Highlights**

Here are some notable strengths of this coffee maker that caught my attention:  
- The Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause feature ensures minimal waiting time for those in a hurry.  
- A reusable filter design reduces waste and keeps things eco-friendly.  
- Excellent brewing consistency ensures that the coffee‚Äôs taste doesn‚Äôt vary day to day.  
- Thoughtful cord storage minimizes counter clutter, keeping your kitchen space more organized.  

**Drawbacks**

That said, there are a few areas where it falters:  
- You won‚Äôt find programmable settings, which could be a dealbreaker for anyone preferring automated morning routines.  
- The carafe lid feels slightly flimsy and might not hold up against long-term, heavy-handed usage.  
- Aroma-seeking coffee lovers might find the brew less robust when compared with pricier machines.  

**Competitive Options**

While functional, this product isn‚Äôt without challengers. Compared to other drip coffee machines like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew or the Cuisinart DCC-3200, the Mr. Coffee SK13-RB can feel somewhat barebones. The Cuisinart unit, for instance, offers advanced programmability and temperature control, which might appeal to more tech-savvy users. On the other hand, the Hamilton Beach model includes single-serve capabilities alongside traditional pot brewing. However, what the Mr. Coffee excels in is simplicity and reliability‚Äîperfect for users who prioritize straightforward operation over bells and whistles.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Evaluating it from a financial perspective, this coffee maker provides excellent value for price-conscious coffee lovers. You won‚Äôt find flashy features like touchscreen controls or integrated bean grinders here, but it does its primary job‚Äîbrewing good coffee‚Äîexceptionally well. It takes care of the little details, such as easy cleaning and cord management, which translates to a hassle-free ownership experience.

1mfw0b4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1mfw0b4/the_litigators_novel_by_john_grisham/,The Litigators  novel by John Grisham:,"CHAPTER 1  
  
¬† The law firm of Finley & Figg referred to itself as a ‚Äúboutique firm.‚Äù This misnomer was inserted as often as possible into routine conversations, and it even appeared in print in some of the various schemes hatched by the partners to solicit business. When used properly, it implied that Finley & Figg was something above your average two-bit operation. Boutique, as in small, gifted, and expert in one specialized area. Boutique, as in pretty cool and chic, right down to the Frenchness of the word itself. Boutique, as in thoroughly happy to be small, selective, and prosperous.  
  
¬† Except for its size, it was none of these things. Finley & Figg‚Äôs scam was hustling injury cases, a daily grind that required little skill or creativity and would never be considered cool or sexy. Profits were as elusive as status. The firm was small because it couldn‚Äôt afford to grow. It was selective only because no one wanted to work there, including the two men who owned it. Even its location suggested a monotonous life out in the bush leagues. With a Vietnamese massage parlor to its left and a lawn mower repair shop to its right, it was clear at a casual glance that Finley & Figg was not prospering. There was another boutique firm directly across the street‚Äîhated rivals‚Äîand more lawyers around the corner. In fact, the neighborhood was teeming with lawyers, some working alone, others in small firms, others still in versions of their own little boutiques.  
  
¬† F&F‚Äôs address was on Preston Avenue, a busy street filled with old bungalows now converted and used for all manner of commercial activity. There was retail (liquor, cleaners, massages) and professional (legal, dental, lawn mower repair) and culinary (enchiladas, baklava, and pizza to go). Oscar Finley had won the building in a lawsuit twenty years earlier. What the address lacked in prestige it sort of made up for in location. Two doors away was the intersection of Preston, Beech, and Thirty-eighth, a chaotic convergence of asphalt and traffic that guaranteed at least one good car wreck a week, and often more. F&F‚Äôs annual overhead was covered by collisions that happened less than one hundred yards away. Other law firms, boutique and otherwise, were often prowling the area in hopes of finding an available, cheap bungalow from which their hungry lawyers could hear the actual squeal of tires and crunching of metal.  
  
¬† With only two attorneys/partners, it was of course mandatory that one be declared the senior and the other the junior. The senior partner was Oscar Finley, age sixty-two, a thirty-year survivor of the bare-knuckle brand of law found on the tough streets of southwest Chicago. Oscar had once been a beat cop but got himself terminated for cracking skulls. He almost went to jail but instead had an awakening and went to college, then law school. When no firms would hire him, he hung out his own little shingle and started suing anyone who came near. Thirty-two years later, he found it hard to believe that for thirty-two years he‚Äôd wasted his career suing for past-due accounts receivable, fender benders, slip-and-falls, and quickie divorces. He was still married to his first wife, a terrifying woman he wanted to sue every day for his own divorce. But he couldn‚Äôt afford it. After thirty-two years of lawyering, Oscar Finley couldn‚Äôt afford much of anything.  
  
¬† His junior partner‚Äîand Oscar was prone to say things like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get my junior partner to handle it,‚Äù when trying to impress judges and other lawyers and especially prospective clients‚Äîwas Wally Figg, age forty-five. Wally fancied himself a hardball litigator, and his blustery ads promised all kinds of aggressive behavior. ‚ÄúWe Fight for Your Rights!‚Äù and ‚ÄúInsurance Companies Fear Us!‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe Mean Business!‚Äù Such ads could be seen on park benches, city transit buses, cabs, high school football programs, even telephone poles, though this violated several ordinances. The ads were not seen in two crucial markets‚Äîtelevision and billboards. Wally and Oscar were still fighting over these. Oscar refused to spend the money‚Äîboth types were horribly expensive‚Äîand Wally was still scheming. His dream was to see his smiling face and slick head on television saying dreadful things about insurance companies while promising huge settlements to injured folks wise enough to call his toll-free number.  
  
¬† But Oscar wouldn‚Äôt even pay for a billboard. Wally had one picked out. Six blocks from the office, at the corner of Beech and Thirty-second, high above the swarming traffic, on top of a four-story tenement house, there was the most perfect billboard in all of metropolitan Chicago. Currently hawking cheap lingerie (with a comely ad, Wally had to admit), the billboard had his name and face written all over it. But Oscar still refused.  
  
¬† Wally‚Äôs law degree came from the prestigious University of Chicago School of Law. Oscar picked his up at a now-defunct place that once offered courses at night. Both took the bar exam three times. Wally had four divorces under his belt; Oscar could only dream. Wally wanted the big case, the big score with millions of dollars in fees. Oscar wanted only two things‚Äîdivorce and retirement.  
  
¬† How the two men came to be partners in a converted house on Preston Avenue was another story. How they survived without choking each other was a daily mystery.  
  
¬† Their referee was Rochelle Gibson, a robust black woman with attitude and savvy earned on the streets from which she came. Ms. Gibson handled the front‚Äîthe phone, the reception, the prospective clients arriving with hope and the disgruntled ones leaving in anger, the occasional typing (though her bosses had learned if they needed something typed, it was far simpler to do it themselves), the firm dog, and, most important, the constant bickering between Oscar and Wally.  
  
¬† Years earlier, Ms. Gibson had been injured in a car wreck that was not her fault. She then compounded her troubles by hiring the law firm of Finley & Figg, though not by choice. Twenty-four hours after the crash, bombed on Percocet and laden with splints and plaster casts, Ms. Gibson had awakened to the grinning, fleshy face of Attorney Wallis Figg hovering over her hospital bed. He was wearing a set of aquamarine scrubs, had a stethoscope around his neck, and was doing a good job of impersonating a physician. Wally tricked her into signing a contract for legal representation, promised her the moon, sneaked out of the room as quietly as he‚Äôd sneaked in, then proceeded to butcher her case. She netted $40,000, which her husband drank and gambled away in a matter of weeks, which led to a divorce action filed by Oscar Finley. He also handled her bankruptcy. Ms. Gibson was not impressed with either lawyer and threatened to sue both for malpractice. This got their attention‚Äîthey had been hit with similar lawsuits‚Äîand they worked hard to placate her. As her troubles multiplied, she became a fixture at the office, and with time the three became comfortable with one another.  
  
¬† Finley & Figg was a tough place for secretaries. The pay was low, the clients were generally unpleasant, the other lawyers on the phone were rude, the hours were long, but the worst part was dealing with the two partners. Oscar and Wally had tried the mature route, but the older gals couldn‚Äôt handle the pressure. They had tried youth but got themselves sued for sexual harassment when Wally couldn‚Äôt keep his paws off a busty young thing. (They settled out of court for $50,000 and got their names in the newspaper.) Rochelle Gibson happened to be at the office one morning when the then-current secretary quit and stormed out. With the phone ringing and partners yelling, Ms. Gibson moved over to the front desk and calmed things down. Then she made a pot of coffee. She was back the next day, and the next. Eight years later, she was still running the place.  
  
¬† Her two sons were in prison. Wally had been their lawyer, though in all fairness no one could have saved them. As teenagers, both boys kept Wally busy with their string of arrests on various drug charges. Their dealing got more involved, and Wally warned them repeatedly they were headed for prison, or death. He said the same to Ms. Gibson, who had little control over the boys and often prayed for prison. When their crack ring got busted, they were sent away for ten years. Wally got it reduced from twenty and received no gratitude from the boys. Ms. Gibson offered a t  
earful thanks. Through all their troubles, Wally never charged her a fee for his representation.  
  
¬† Over the years, there had been many tears in Ms. Gibson‚Äôs life, and they had often been shed in Wally‚Äôs office with the door locked. He gave advice and tried to help when possible, but his greatest role was that of a listener. And with Wally‚Äôs sloppy life, the tables could be turned quickly. When his last two marriages blew up, Ms. Gibson heard it all and offered encouragement. When his drinking picked up, she saw it clearly and was not afraid to confront him. Though they fought daily, their quarrels were always temporary and often contrived as a means of protecting turf.  
  
¬† There were times at Finley & Figg when all three were snarling or sulking, and money was usually the cause. The market was simply overcrowded; there were too many lawyers loose on the streets.  
  
¬† The last thing the firm needed was another one.  
  
¬† CHAPTER 2  
  
¬† David Zinc made it off the L train at the Quincy Station in downtown Chicago, and he managed to shuffle down the steps that led to Wells Street, but something was going wrong with his feet. They were getting heavier and heavier, his steps slower and slower. He stopped at the corner of Wells and Adams and actually looked at his shoes for a clue. Nothing, just the same standard black leather lace-ups worn by every male lawyer in the firm, and a couple of the females as well. His breathing was labored, and in spite of the chill he felt moisture in his armpits. He was thirty-one years old, certainly too young for a heart attack, and though he‚Äôd been exhausted for the past five years, he had learned to live with his fatigue. Or so he thought. He turned a corner and looked at the Trust Tower, a glistening phallic monument jutting one thousand feet upward into the clouds and fog. As he paused and looked up, his heart rate quickened and he felt nauseous. Bodies touched him as they jostled by. He crossed Adams in a pack and plodded on.  
  
¬† The atrium of the Trust Tower was tall and open, with plenty of marble and glass and incomprehensible sculpture designed to inspire and provide warmth, when in reality it seemed cold and forbidding, at least to David. Six escalators crisscrossed each other and hauled hordes of weary warriors up to their cubicles and offices. David tried, but his feet would not carry him to an escalator. Instead, he sat on a leather bench beside a pile of large painted rocks and tried to understand what was happening to him. People rushed by, grim-faced, hollow-eyed, stressed-out already, and it was only 7:30 on this gloomy morning.  
  
¬† A ‚Äúsnap‚Äù is certainly not a medical term. Experts use fancier language to describe the instant when a troubled person steps over the edge. Nonetheless, a snap is a real moment. It can happen in a split second, the result of a terribly traumatic event. Or it can be the final straw, the sad culmination of pressure that builds and builds until the mind and body must find a release. David Zinc‚Äôs snap was of the latter variety. After five years of savage labor with colleagues he loathed, something happened to David that morning as he sat by the painted rocks and watched the well-dressed zombies ride upward to yet another day of useless labor. He snapped.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey Dave. You going up?‚Äù someone was saying. It was Al, from antitrust.  
  
¬† David managed to smile and nod and mumble, then he stood and followed Al for some reason. Al was a step ahead as they got onto an escalator, and he was talking about last night‚Äôs Blackhawks game. David kept nodding as they rose through the atrium. Below him and following behind were dozens of lonely figures in dark overcoats, other young lawyers rising, quiet and somber, much like pallbearers at a winter funeral. David and Al joined a group at a wall of elevators on the first level. As they waited, David listened to the hockey talk, but his head was spinning and he was nauseous again. They rushed onto an elevator and stood shoulder to shoulder with too many others. Silence. Al was quiet. No one spoke; no one made eye contact.  
  
¬† David said to himself: ‚ÄúThis is it‚Äîmy last ride in this elevator. I swear.‚Äù  
  
¬† The elevator rocked and hummed, then stopped at the eightieth floor, Rogan Rothberg territory. Three lawyers got off, three faces David had seen before but didn‚Äôt know by name, which was not unusual because the firm had six hundred lawyers on floors seventy through one hundred. Two more dark suits got off at eighty-four. As they continued to rise, David began to sweat, then to hyperventilate. His tiny office was on the ninety-third floor, and the closer he got, the more violently his heart pumped. More somber exits on ninety and ninety-one, and with each stop David felt weaker and weaker.  
  
¬† Only three were left at ninety-three‚ÄîDavid, Al, and a large woman who was called Lurch behind her back. The elevator stopped, a bell chimed pleasantly, the door opened silently, and Lurch stepped off. Al stepped off. David refused to move; in fact, he couldn‚Äôt move. Seconds passed. Al looked over his shoulder and said, ‚ÄúHey, David, this is us. Come on.‚Äù  
  
¬† No response from David, just the blank, hollow gaze of someone in another world. The door began to close, and Al jammed his briefcase in the opening. ‚ÄúDavid, you okay?‚Äù Al asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù David mumbled as he managed to move forward. The door slid open, the bell chimed again. He was out of the elevator, looking around nervously as if he‚Äôd never before seen the place. In fact, he‚Äôd left it only ten hours earlier.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou look pale,‚Äù Al said.  
  
¬† David‚Äôs head was spinning. He heard Al‚Äôs voice but didn‚Äôt comprehend what he was saying. Lurch was a few feet away, staring, puzzled, as if watching a car wreck. The elevator pinged again, a different sound, and the door began to close. Al said something else, even reached out a hand as if to help. Suddenly David spun and his leaden feet came to life. He bolted for the elevator and made a diving reentry just as the door slammed shut. The last thing he heard from the outside was Al‚Äôs panicked voice.  
  
¬† When the elevator began its descent, David Zinc started to laugh. The spinning and nausea were gone. The pressure on his chest vanished. He was doing it! He was leaving the sweatshop of Rogan Rothberg and saying farewell to a nightmare. He, David Zinc, of all the thousands of miserable associates and junior partners in the tall buildings of downtown Chicago, he and he alone had found the spine to walk away that gloomy morning. He sat on the floor in the empty elevator, watching with a wide grin as the floor numbers zipped downward in bright red digital numbers, and he fought to control his thoughts. The people: (1) his wife, a neglected woman who wanted to get pregnant but found it difficult because her husband was too tired for sex; (2) his father, a prominent judge who had basically forced him to go to law school, and not just anywhere but Harvard Law School because that‚Äôs where the judge had gone; (3) his grandfather, the family tyrant who‚Äôd built a mega firm from scratch in Kansas City and still put in ten hours a day at the age of eighty-two; and (4) Roy Barton, his supervising partner, his boss, a prickish crank who yelled and cursed throughout the day and was perhaps the most miserable person David Zinc had ever met. When he thought of Roy Barton, he laughed again.  
  
¬† The elevator stopped at the eightieth floor, and two secretaries started to enter. They paused momentarily when confronted with David sitting in a corner, briefcase at his side. Carefully, they stepped over his legs and waited for the door to close. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù one asked. ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù David answered. ‚ÄúAnd you?‚Äù  
  
¬† There was no response. The secretaries stood rigid and quiet during the brief descent and hustled off at seventy-seven. When David was alone again, he was suddenly worried. What if they came after him? Al would no doubt go straight to Roy Barton and report that Zinc had cracked up. What would Barton do? There was a huge meeting at ten with an angry client, a big-shot CEO; in fact, as David would think about things later, the showdown was probably the tipping point that finally caused the Snap. Roy Barton was not only an abrasive prick but also a coward. He needed David Zinc and others to hide behind when the CEO marched in with a long list of valid complaints.  
  
¬† Roy might send Security after him. Security was the usual contingent of aging uniformed door guards, but it was also an in-house spy ring that changed locks, videoed everything, moved in the shadows, and engaged in all manner of covert ac  
tivities designed to keep the lawyers in line. David jumped to his feet, picked up his briefcase, and stared impatiently at the digital numbers blinking by. The elevator rocked gently as it fell through the center of the Trust Tower. When it stopped, David got off and darted to the escalators, which were still packed with sad folks moving silently upward. The descending escalators were unclogged, and David ran down one. Someone called out, ‚ÄúHey, Dave, where are you going?‚Äù David smiled and waved in the general direction of the voice, as if everything was under control. He strode past the painted rocks and bizarre sculpture, and he eased his way through a glass door. He was outside, and the air that had seemed so wet and dreary moments earlier now held the promise of a new beginning.  
  
¬† He took a deep breath and looked around. Gotta keep moving. He began walking down LaSalle Street, quickly, afraid to look over his shoulder. Don‚Äôt look suspicious. Be calm. This is now one of the most important days of your life, he told himself, so don‚Äôt blow it. He couldn‚Äôt go home because he was not ready for that confrontation. He couldn‚Äôt walk the streets because he would bump into someone he knew. Where could he hide for a while, think about things, clear his head, make a plan? He checked his watch, 7:51, the perfect time for breakfast. Down an alley he saw the red-and-green flashing neon sign of Abner‚Äôs, and as he grew closer, he couldn‚Äôt tell if it was a caf√© or a bar. At the door he glanced over his shoulder, made sure Security was nowhere in sight, and entered the warm, dark world of Abner‚Äôs.  
  
¬† It was a bar. The booths along the right were empty. The chairs were sitting upside down on the tables, waiting for someone to clean the floor. Abner was behind the long, well-polished wooden counter with a smirk on his face, as if to ask, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you open?‚Äù David asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWas the door locked?‚Äù Abner shot back. He wore a white apron and was drying a beer mug. He had thick, hairy forearms, and in spite of his gruff manner he had the trusting face of a veteran bartender who‚Äôd heard it all before.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI guess not.‚Äù David walked slowly to the bar, glanced to his right, and at the far end saw a man who‚Äôd apparently passed out, still holding a drink.  
  
¬† David removed his charcoal-gray overcoat and hung it on the back of a stool. He took a seat, looked at the rows of liquor bottles aligned in front of him, took in the mirrors and beer taps and dozens of glasses Abner had arranged perfectly, and when he was settled, he said, ‚ÄúWhat do you recommend before eight o‚Äôclock?‚Äù Abner looked at the man with his head on the counter and said, ‚ÄúHow about coffee?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already had that. Do you serve breakfast?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYep, it‚Äôs called a Bloody Mary.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take one.‚Äù  
  
¬† Rochelle Gibson lived in a subsidized apartment with her mother, one of her daughters, two of her grandchildren, varying combinations of nieces and nephews, and even an occasional cousin in need of shelter. To escape the chaos, she often fled to her workplace, though at times it was worse than home. She arrived at the office each day around 7:30, unlocked the place, fetched both newspapers from the porch, turned on the lights, adjusted the thermostat, made the coffee, and checked on AC, the firm dog. She hummed and sometimes sang softly as she went about her routine. Though she would never admit it to either of her bosses, she was quite proud to be a legal secretary, even in a place like Finley & Figg. When asked her job or profession, she was always quick to state ‚Äúlegal secretary.‚Äù Never just a garden-variety secretary, but a legal one. What she lacked in formal training she made up for in experience. Eight years in the middle of a busy street practice had taught her a lot of law and even more about lawyers.  
  
¬† AC was a mutt who lived at the office because no one there was willing to take him home. He belonged to the three‚ÄîRochelle, Oscar, and Wally‚Äîin equal shares, though virtually all of the responsibilities of his care fell upon Rochelle. He was a runaway who‚Äôd chosen F&F as his home several years earlier. Throughout the day he slept on a small bed near Rochelle, and throughout the night he roamed the office, guarding the place. He was a passable watchdog whose bark had chased away burglars, vandals, and even several disgruntled clients.

¬† Rochelle fed him and filled his water bowl. From the small fridge in the kitchen, she removed a container of strawberry yogurt. When the coffee was ready, she poured herself a cup and arranged things just so on her desk, which she kept in immaculate order. It was glass and chrome, sturdy and impressive, the first thing clients saw when they walked through the front door. Oscar‚Äôs office was somewhat tidy. Wally‚Äôs was a landfill. They could hide their business behind closed doors, but Rochelle‚Äôs was in plain view.  
  
¬† She opened the Sun-Times and started with the front page. She read slowly, sipping her coffee, eating her yogurt, humming softly while AC snored behind her. Rochelle treasured these few quiet moments of the early morning. Before long, the phone would start, the lawyers would appear, and then, if they were lucky, clients would arrive, some with appointments, others without.  
  
¬† To get away from his wife, Oscar Finley left home each morning at seven, but he seldom got to the office before nine. For two hours he moved around the city, stopping by a police station where a cousin handled accident reports, dropping in to say hello to tow truck drivers and catch the latest gossip on the most recent car wrecks, drinking coffee with a man who owned two low-end funeral parlors, taking doughnuts to a fire station and chatting with the ambulance drivers, and occasionally making his rounds at his favorite hospitals, where he walked the busy halls casting a trained eye for those injured by the negligence of others.  
  
¬† Oscar arrived at nine. With Wally, whose life was far less organized, one never knew. He could blow in at 7:30, fueled by caffeine and Red Bull and ready to sue anyone who crossed him, or he could drag in at 11:00, puffy eyed, hungover, and soon hiding in his office.  
  
¬† On this momentous day, however, Wally arrived a few minutes before eight with a big smile and clear eyes. ‚ÄúGood morning, Ms. Gibson,‚Äù he said with conviction.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood morning, Mr. Figg,‚Äù she responded in similar fashion. At Finley & Figg, the atmosphere was always tense, with a fight just one comment away. Words were chosen carefully and received with scrutiny. The mundane early morning salutes were cautiously handled because they could be a setup for an attack. Even the use of ‚ÄúMr.‚Äù and ‚ÄúMs.‚Äù was contrived and loaded with history. Back when Rochelle had been only a client, Wally had made the mistake of referring to her as a ‚Äúgirl.‚Äù It had been something like, ‚ÄúLook, girl, I‚Äôm doing the best I can here.‚Äù He certainly meant no harm by it, and her overreaction was uncalled for, but from that moment on she insisted on being addressed as ‚ÄúMs. Gibson.‚Äù  
  
¬† She was slightly irritated because her solitude was interrupted. Wally spoke to AC and rubbed his head, and as he headed for the coffee, he asked, ‚ÄúAnything in the paper?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said, not wanting to discuss the news.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo surprise there,‚Äù he said, the first shot of the day. She read the Sun-Times. He read the Tribune. Each considered the other‚Äôs taste in news to be rather low.  
  
¬† The second shot came moments later when Wally reappeared. ‚ÄúWho made the coffee?‚Äù he asked.  
  
¬† She ignored this.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bit weak, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù  
  
¬† She slowly turned a page, then had some yogurt.  
  
¬† Wally sipped loudly, smacked his lips, frowned as though swallowing vinegar, then picked up his newspaper and took a seat at the table. Before Oscar won the building in a lawsuit, someone had knocked out several of the walls downstairs near the front and created an open lobby area. Rochelle had her space on one side, near the door, and a few feet away there were chairs for waiting clients and a long table that was once used somewhere for dining purposes. Over the years, the table had become the place where newspapers were read, coffee consumed, even depositions taken. Wally liked to kill time there because his office was such a pigsty.  
  
¬† He flung open his Tribune with as much noise as possible. Rochelle ignored him and hummed away.  
  
¬† A few minutes passed, and the phone rang. Ms. Gibson seemed not to hear it. It rang again. After the third ring, Wally lowered his newspaper and said, ‚ÄúYou wanna get that, Ms. Gibson?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she answered shortly.  
  
¬† It rang a fourth time.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd why not?‚Äù he demanded.  
  
¬† She ignored him. After the fifth ring, Wally threw down his newspaper, jumped to his feet, and headed for a phone on the wall near the copier. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt get that if I were you,‚Äù Ms. Gibson said.  
  
¬† He stopped. ‚ÄúAnd why not?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bill collector.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow do you know?‚Äù Wally stared at the phone. Caller ID revealed ‚ÄúNAME UNKNOWN.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI just do. He calls this time every week.‚Äù  
  
¬† The phone went silent, and Wally returned to the table and his newspaper. He hid behind it, wondering which bill had not been paid, which supplier was irritated enough to call a law office and put the squeeze on lawyers. Rochelle knew, of course, because she kept the books and knew almost everything, but he preferred not to ask her. If he did, then they would soon be bickering over the bills and unpaid fees and lack of money in general, and this could easily spiral down into a heated discussion about overall strategies of the firm, its future, and the shortcomings of its partners.  
  
¬† Neither wanted this.  
  
¬† Abner took great pride in his Bloody Marys. He used precise amounts of tomato juice, vodka, horseradish, lemon, lime, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, Tabasco, and salt. He always added two green olives, then finished it with a stalk of celery.  
  
¬† It had been a long time since David had enjoyed such a fine breakfast. After two of Abner‚Äôs creations, consumed rapidly, he was grinning goofily and proud of his decision to chuck it all. The drunk at the end of the bar was snoring. There were no other customers. Abner was a man about his business, washing and drying cocktail glasses, taking inventory of his booze, and fiddling with the beer taps while offering commentary on a wide variety of subjects.  
  
¬† David‚Äôs phone finally rang. It was his secretary, Lana. ‚ÄúOh, boy,‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù Abner asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe office.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA man‚Äôs entitled to breakfast, isn‚Äôt he?‚Äù  
  
¬† David grinned again and said, ‚ÄúHello.‚Äù  
  
¬† Lana said, ‚ÄúDavid, where are you? It‚Äôs eight thirty.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI have a watch, dear. I‚Äôm having breakfast.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you okay? Word‚Äôs out that you were last seen diving back into an elevator.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJust a rumor, dear, just a rumor.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood. What time will you be in? Roy Barton has already called.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLet me finish breakfast, okay?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSure. Just keep in touch.‚Äù  
  
¬† David put down his phone, sucked hard on the straw, then announced, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have another.‚Äù Abner frowned and said, ‚ÄúYou might want to pace yourself.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI am pacing myself.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù Abner pulled down a clean glass and started mixing. ‚ÄúI take it you‚Äôre not going to the office today.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI am not. I quit. I‚Äôm walking away.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat type of office?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLaw. Rogan Rothberg. You know the outfit?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHeard of it. Big firm, right?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSix hundred lawyers here in the Chicago office. Couple of thousand around the world. Currently in third place when it comes to size, fifth place in hours billed per lawyer, fourth place when looking at net profits per partner, second place when comparing associates‚Äô salaries, and, without question, first place when counting assholes per square foot.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSorry I asked.‚Äù  
  
¬† David picked up his phone and asked, ‚ÄúYou see this phone?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm blind?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis thing has ruled my life for the past five years. Can‚Äôt go anywhere without it. Firm policy. It stays with me at all times. It‚Äôs interrupted nice dinners in restaurants. It‚Äôs dragged me out of the shower. It‚Äôs woken me up at all hours of the night. On one occasion it‚Äôs interrupted sex with my poor neglected wife. I was at a Cubs game last summer, great seats, me and two buddies from college, top of the second inning, and this thing st  
arts vibrating. It was Roy Barton. Have I told you about Roy Barton?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy supervising partner, a pernicious little bastard. Forty years old, warped ego, God‚Äôs gift to the legal profession. Makes a million bucks a year but he‚Äôll never make enough. Works fifteen hours a day, seven days a week, because at Rogan Rothberg all Big Men work nonstop. And Roy fancies himself a really Big Man.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNice guy, huh?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI hate him. I hope I never see his face again.‚Äù  
  
¬† Abner slid the third Bloody Mary across the counter and said, ‚ÄúLooks like you‚Äôre on the right track, pal. Cheers.‚Äù  
  
¬† CHAPTER 3  
  
¬† The phone rang again, and Rochelle decided to answer it. ‚ÄúThe law firm of Finley & Figg,‚Äù she said professionally. Wally did not look up from his newspaper. She listened for a moment, then said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but we do not handle real estate transactions.‚Äù  
  
¬† When Rochelle assumed her position eight years earlier, the firm did in fact handle real estate transactions. However, she soon realized this type of work paid little and relied heavily upon the secretary with almost no effort from the lawyers. A quick study, she decided she disliked real estate. Because she controlled the phone, she screened all calls, and the real estate section of Finley & Figg dried up. Oscar was outraged and threatened to fire her but backed down when she mentioned, again, that she might sue them for legal malpractice. Wally brokered a truce, but for weeks things were more tense than usual.  
  
¬† Other specialties had been cast aside under her diligent screening. Criminal work was history; Rochelle didn‚Äôt like it, because she didn‚Äôt like the clients. DUIs were okay because there were so many of them, they paid well, and they required almost no involvement on her part. Bankruptcy bit the dust for the same reason that real estate had‚Äîpaltry fees and too much work for the secretary. Over the years Rochelle had managed to streamline the firm‚Äôs practice, and this was still causing problems. Oscar‚Äôs theory, one that had kept him broke for over thirty years, was the firm should take everything that walked in the door, cast a wide net, then pick through the debris in the hope of finding a good injury case. Wally disagreed. He wanted the big kill. Though he was forced by the overhead to perform all sorts of mundane legal tasks, he was always dreaming of ways to strike gold.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNice work,‚Äù he said when she hung up. ‚ÄúI never liked real estate.‚Äù  
  
¬† She ignored this and returned to her newspaper. AC began a low growl. When they looked at him, he was standing on his small bed, nose tilted upward, tail straight and pointing, eyes narrow with concentration. His growl grew louder, then, on cue, the distant sound of an ambulance entered their solemn morning. Sirens never failed to excite Wally, and for a second or two he froze as he skillfully analyzed it. Police, fire, or ambulance? That was always the first issue, and Wally could distinguish the three in a heartbeat. Sirens from fire trucks and police cars meant nothing and were quickly ignored, but a siren from an ambulance always quickened his pulse.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAmbulance,‚Äù he said, then placed his newspaper on the table, stood, and casually walked to the front door. Rochelle also stood and walked to a window where she opened the blinds for a quick look. AC was still growling, and when Wally opened the door and stepped onto the front porch, the dog followed. Across the street, Vince Gholston exited his own little boutique and cast a hopeful look at the intersection of Beech and Thirty-eighth. When he saw Wally, he flipped him the bird, and Wally quickly returned the greeting.  
  
¬† The ambulance came screaming down Beech, weaving and lurching its way through heavy traffic, honking angrily, causing more havoc and danger than whatever awaited it. Wally watched it until it was out of sight, then went inside.  
  
¬† The newspaper reading continued with no further interruptions‚Äîno sirens, no phone calls from prospective clients or bill collectors. At 9:00 a.m., the door opened, and the senior partner entered. As usual, Oscar wore a long dark overcoat and carried a bulky black leather briefcase, as if he‚Äôd been laboring away throughout the night. He also carried his umbrella, as always, regardless of the weather or forecast. Oscar toiled far away from the big leagues, but he could at least look the part of a distinguished lawyer. Dark coats, dark suits, white shirts, and silk ties. His wife did the shopping and insisted that he look the part. Wally, on the other hand, wore whatever he could pull from the pile.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù Oscar said gruffly at Ms. Gibson‚Äôs desk.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù she replied.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnything in the newspaper?‚Äù Oscar was not interested in scores or floods or market reports or the latest from the Middle East.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA forklift operator got crushed in a plant out in Palos Heights,‚Äù Ms. Gibson responded promptly. It was part of their morning ritual. If she did not find an accident of some variety to brighten his morning, then his sour mood would only get worse.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI like it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIs he dead?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEven better. Lots of pain and suffering. Make a note. I‚Äôll check it out later.‚Äù  
  
¬† Ms. Gibson nodded as if the poor man were practically signed up as a new client. Of course, he was not. Nor would he be. Finley & Figg rarely got to the accident scene first. Chances were the forklift operator‚Äôs wife was already being hounded by more aggressive lawyers, some of whom were known to offer cash and other goodies to get the family on board.  
  
¬† Buoyed by this good news, Oscar walked over to the table and said, ‚ÄúGood morning.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMorning, Oscar,‚Äù Wally said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAny of our clients make the obituaries?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt got that far yet.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou should start with the obituaries.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThank you, Oscar. Any more tips on how to read a newspaper?‚Äù  
  
¬† Oscar was already walking away. Over his shoulder he asked Ms. Gibson, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs on my calendar for today?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe usual. Divorces and drunks.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDivorces and drunks,‚Äù Oscar mumbled to himself as he stepped into his office. ‚ÄúWhat I need is a good car wreck.‚Äù He hung his overcoat on the back of the door, placed his umbrella in a rack by his desk, and began unpacking his briefcase. Wally was soon standing nearby, holding the newspaper. ‚ÄúDoes the name Chester Marino ring a bell?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúObit. Age fifty-seven, wife, kids, grandkids, no cause given.‚Äù  
  
¬† Oscar scratched his close-cropped gray hair and said, ‚ÄúMaybe. Could‚Äôve been a last will and testament.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey got him down at Van Easel & Sons. Visitation tonight, service tomorrow. I‚Äôll snoop around and see what‚Äôs up. If he‚Äôs one of ours, you wanna send flowers?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot until you know the size of his estate.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood point.‚Äù Wally was still holding his newspaper. ‚ÄúThis Taser thing is out of control, you know. Cops in Joliet are accused of Tasering a seventy-year-old man who went to Walmart to buy Sudafed for his sick grandchild. The pharmacist figured the old man was using the stuff for a meth lab, so the pharmacist, being a good citizen, called the cops. Turns out the cops all got themselves brand-new Tasers, so five of these clowns stop the old man in the parking lot and Taser his ass. Critical condition.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre back doing Taser law, are we, Wally?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDamn right we are. These are good cases, Oscar. We gotta get a few.‚Äù  
  
¬† Oscar sat down and sighed heavily. ‚ÄúSo this week it‚Äôs Taser guns. Last week it was diaper rashes‚Äîbig plans to sue the makers of Pampers because a few thousand babies have diaper rashes. Last month it was Chinese drywall.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve paid four billion bucks already in the drywall class action.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, but we haven‚Äôt seen any of it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my point, Oscar. We have got to get serious about these mass tort cases. This is where the money is. Millions in fees paid by companies that make billions in profits.‚Äù  
  
¬† The door was open, and Rochelle was listening to every word, though this particular conversation was getting a bit stale.  
  
¬† Wally was talking louder. ‚ÄúWe get us a few of these cases, then hook up with th  
e mass tort specialists, give them a piece of the cake, then ride their coattails until they settle, and we walk away with a truckload. It‚Äôs easy money, Oscar.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDiaper rashes?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay, that didn‚Äôt work. But this Taser thing is a gold mine.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnother gold mine, Wally?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYep, I‚Äôll prove it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou do that.‚Äù  
  
¬† The drunk at the end of the bar had rallied somewhat. His head was up, his eyes were partially open, and Abner was serving him coffee and chatting away, all in an effort to convince the man it was time to leave. A teenager with a broom was sweeping the floor and arranging tables and chairs.

If I then finish with the varathane, will the resulting finish be hard and 'slick' enough for a coffee table?  If I slide a glass of water along it, I don't want it stick and tip over, if you get my meaning...

It‚Äôs the little things, like how easy it is to use the rewards toward your Amazon balance. I‚Äôm already eyeing a new pair of headphones, so that $100 will come in handy.

1mfvxco,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotraveler/comments/1mfvxco/driving_in_saudi_arabia_as_a_foreign_tourist/,Driving in Saudi Arabia as a Foreign Tourist,"https://preview.redd.it/jftdxyq43ngf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=51a5c24468431b25f9727a8eeffef2205768e713

 Exploring Saudi Arabia by car as a foreign tourist is an exhilarating way to experience its diverse landscapes, from sprawling deserts to majestic mountains and vibrant cities. With modern highways, unique cultural experiences, and a growing tourism infrastructure, driving in the Kingdom offers freedom and adventure. This article shares a real tourist‚Äôs perspective on driving in Saudi Arabia, covering how to rent a car as a foreigner, obtaining an International Driving Permit (IDP) for use in the country, and unforgettable experiences at touristic sites, desert safaris, and mountain roads. Buckle up for a journey filled with discovery and a happy ending!

# Driving Experience as a Foreign Tourist in Saudi Arabia

As a foreign tourist, driving in Saudi Arabia feels like stepping into a blend of modernity and tradition. The Kingdom‚Äôs roads are generally well-maintained, with major highways connecting cities like Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam, offering smooth drives and clear signage in Arabic and English. Urban areas can be busy, with fast-moving traffic and occasional aggressive driving, but patience and defensive driving make it manageable. In rural areas, the open roads and stunning landscapes‚Äîlike the vast deserts and rugged mountains‚Äîcreate a sense of freedom. I was initially nervous about navigating a foreign country, but the GPS on my phone (Google Maps worked flawlessly) and the welcoming attitude of locals made it easier. One tip: always carry your passport, driver‚Äôs license, and IDP, as police may request them at checkpoints. During Ramadan, I noticed lighter traffic during sunset as locals broke their fast, which was a unique cultural experience. The joy of driving past historic sites and modern skyscrapers while soaking in Saudi Arabia‚Äôs rich culture made every mile worthwhile.

# How to Rent a Car as a Foreign Tourist in Saudi Arabia

Renting a car in Saudi Arabia is straightforward for tourists, offering flexibility to explore at your own pace. To rent a car, you need to be at least 21 years old (some companies require 25), hold a valid driver‚Äôs license from your home country, and present an International Driving Permit (IDP) alongside your license, especially if it‚Äôs not in English or Arabic. A valid passport and a credit card for the security deposit are also required. Major international rental companies like Avis, Budget, and local providers like Final Rentals operate at airports and cities, with daily rates starting at around SR 100 (USD 26) for compact cars and up to SR 750 (USD 200) for luxury vehicles or SUVs. I rented an SUV from Avis at Riyadh airport, and the process was seamless‚Äîmy EU license and IDP were accepted without issue, though I called ahead to confirm. Be sure to check the rental agreement for mileage limits, as some companies impose daily caps unless you opt for an ‚Äúopen kilometer‚Äù plan. Comprehensive insurance is recommended for peace of mind, as basic third-party liability is usually included. Always inspect the car for safety features like airbags and seat belts, and ensure the air conditioning works well for Saudi Arabia‚Äôs hot climate.

# Obtaining an International Driving License for Saudi Arabia

To drive legally in Saudi Arabia, tourists must carry a valid driver‚Äôs license from their home country and an [Saudi Arabia International Driving Permit ](https://www.e-itca.org/international-driving-license-saudi-arabia)(IDP), which serves as a translation of your license into multiple languages, including Arabic. The IDP is valid for up to one year from your arrival in Saudi Arabia or until your home license expires, whichever comes first. I obtained my IDP through [https://www.e-itca.org/](https://www.e-itca.org/), a trusted provider that issues permits compliant with the UN Conventions of 1949 and 1968. The online application took just 15 minutes: I uploaded my valid driver‚Äôs license, a passport-size photo, and paid a fee (special shipping to India costs ‚Ç¨8). Within 30 minutes, I received a digital copy, and the physical booklet and card arrived via express shipping. The process was secure, and the IDP‚Äôs translation into 15 languages, including Arabic, made interactions with rental agencies and police hassle-free. Always carry both your national license and IDP, as the IDP is not a standalone document. For licenses in non-Roman alphabets (e.g., Hindi or Chinese), an Arabic translation may also be required, but the IDP usually suffices.

# Experiencing Touristic Places by Car

Driving to Saudi Arabia‚Äôs touristic sites is a highlight for any visitor. I started my journey in Riyadh, visiting the historic Al Masmak Fortress, a mud-brick structure that tells the story of the Kingdom‚Äôs founding. The drive to the fortress was easy, with clear signage and ample parking. Next, I headed to the UNESCO-listed Al Rajhi Grand Mosque, its stunning architecture glowing under the evening lights. The freedom of having a car allowed me to explore at my own pace, stopping at local cafes for Arabic coffee and dates. Another gem was the coastal city of Jeddah, where I drove along the scenic Corniche, marveling at the Red Sea views and the iconic King Fahd Fountain. The roads to these sites were well-paved, and I felt safe as a solo traveler, especially as a woman, thanks to Saudi Arabia‚Äôs progressive driving laws since 2018. Visiting these places by car gave me flexibility to linger at sites and discover hidden spots, like small souks selling traditional crafts, making the experience deeply personal and immersive.

# Desert Safari with a Car

A desert safari in Saudi Arabia is an adventure like no other, and driving a 4x4 through the dunes is a bucket-list experience. I joined a guided desert safari near the Rub‚Äô al Khali (Empty Quarter), one of the world‚Äôs largest sand deserts. Renting a robust 4x4 was essential, as the shifting sands require a powerful vehicle and some off-road driving skills. The guide emphasized staying on marked paths to avoid getting stuck, as sand can be treacherous for inexperienced drivers. The vast golden dunes stretched endlessly, and the thrill of navigating them felt like a scene from an adventure movie. At sunset, we stopped at a Bedouin-style camp, where I enjoyed traditional Saudi hospitality‚Äîsipping tea, eating grilled meats, and stargazing under a clear desert sky. The drive back was serene, with the desert‚Äôs silence leaving a lasting impression. For solo travelers, I recommend joining a convoy or guided tour for safety, and always carry extra water and a charged phone. The desert safari was a heart-pounding yet soul-soothing experience that showcased Saudi Arabia‚Äôs raw beauty.

# Driving in Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Mountains

Driving through Saudi Arabia‚Äôs mountains, particularly the route from Taif to Al Baha, was a breathtaking experience. The winding roads, surrounded by lush forests and dramatic cliffs, offered cooler climates and stunning vistas compared to the desert plains. The mountain switchbacks required focus, as some turns were sharp, but the roads were well-maintained, and my SUV handled them with ease. I stopped frequently to capture photos of the rugged peaks and valleys, feeling a sense of awe at the Kingdom‚Äôs diverse geography. Locals at roadside stalls sold fresh fruits like pomegranates, adding a warm, human touch to the journey. One challenge was navigating occasional fog, so I used fog lights and kept a safe distance from other vehicles. The drive felt like a perfect blend of adventure and tranquility, with every curve revealing a new view. For mountain driving, ensure your vehicle is in good condition, and avoid speeding, as curves can be unpredictable. This experience was a reminder of how driving unlocks Saudi Arabia‚Äôs hidden gems.

# A Happy Ending to the Journey

My road trip through Saudi Arabia was a transformative adventure, blending the thrill of exploration with the warmth of human connection. From navigating bustling city streets to conquering desert dunes and winding mountain roads, driving as a foreign tourist gave me unparalleled freedom to discover the Kingdom‚Äôs soul. Renting a car was easy, and the E-ITCA IDP ensured I was legally prepared. The touristic sites, like Al Masmak and Jeddah‚Äôs Corniche, brought history and culture to life, while the desert safari and mountain drives offered raw, natural beauty. The kindness of locals‚Äîwhether sharing tea in the desert or offering directions in Riyadh‚Äîmade me feel welcomed. As I returned my rental car at Jeddah airport, I felt a mix of exhaustion and joy, knowing I‚Äôd experienced Saudi Arabia in a way few do. With memories of starry desert nights and mountain sunrises, I left with a promise to return, my heart full of gratitude for a journey that was as safe as it was spectacular.

*Disclaimer*: Always verify local driving regulations and rental requirements before traveling. Carry your IDP, national license, and passport at all times, and respect Saudi Arabia‚Äôs traffic laws and cultural customs for a safe experience.

Camp had been a lot these past months: as head counselors, the brothers had spent sleepless nights comforting younger campers and hearing updates from Chiron. What they hadn‚Äôt been doing as much was being counselors of Eros. There just wasn‚Äôt enough time, and well, that sucked.¬†

Today that changed, because Austin and Jason also had a whole cabin to tend to, so earlier this week they told Harry about the cabin meeting happening on Saturday. Not much had changed in the cabin‚Äôs living room for the meeting, except for a tray of summertime snacks resting on the coffee table.

Austin and Jason would greet Harry with a smile once their baby, not-so-baby, brother entered. ‚Äò‚ÄôOkay, Harry, you know we‚Äôre the only Eros kids at camp, but we gotta do it the official way too: a cabin meeting. How are you, how‚Äôs life, etcetera, etcetera.‚Äô‚Äô Jason yapped.

‚Äò‚ÄôAnd, we were also wondering if you had ideas for alliances? We‚Äôre open to everything.‚Äô‚Äô Austin said with a smile. ‚Äò‚ÄôIs there anything you want to do before summer ends?‚Äô‚Äô he added, giving Harry the stage.

For the second part of the cabin meeting, the Eros cabin opened its doors for an open house, announced on the notice board. Everyone was welcome to come take a look at the, no doubt, prettiest cabin at camp. Only the living room was accessible today, where the twins would happily discuss alliances, answer questions, or anything else.

I know what people think of me.
 They think I‚Äôm broken. Or dangerous.
They don‚Äôt understand.
I‚Äôm not a monster.
 I‚Äôm a good boyfriend.

I first saw her outside the pharmacy on Oak Street.
 She was carrying a paper bag and scrolling through her phone. She bumped into someone, dropped her receipt.
 I picked it up for her.
She smiled.
 Just a little smile.
 But it stayed with me.
It meant something.
 It had to.
I trailed her home that evening.
 Not to be creepy ‚Äî just to make sure she got there safe.
 She walked with music in her ears, barely looking around. So unaware.
 Anyone could‚Äôve hurt her.
 She needed someone to look after her.
That‚Äôs what boyfriends do.

Her name was Madison.
 I learned that from the label on her pharmacy bag.
 Madison Grey.
Nice name.
 Clean.
 Warm.
She lived in a little brick townhouse near the park.
 Unit 4B.
 I walked past it three times that night. The curtains were closed, but the lights were on.
 She was home.
 Safe.
That should‚Äôve been enough.
 But it wasn‚Äôt.

At first, I only watched from across the street.
 A car. A bench. A shadow.
She always kept the same routine. Work, coffee shop, home.
 She‚Äôd heat up microwave dinners and binge true crime shows.
 Ironically.
On Tuesdays she watered her plants.
 On Thursdays she did laundry.
 On Sundays she took long showers and sang to herself.
I liked that.
 That was ours.
 She just didn‚Äôt know it yet.

I broke in for the first time a few weeks later.
She left for work at 8:15 sharp.
 Took a Lyft. Didn‚Äôt lock the window.
 That wasn‚Äôt safe.
I didn‚Äôt take anything.
 Didn‚Äôt mess anything up.
 I just wanted to look around.
Her couch was soft. Her throw blanket smelled like lavender.
 I sat for a while. Imagined her curled up next to me.
 Watched a few minutes of her show before I left.
It felt right.
 Like I belonged there.

Eventually, I stopped leaving.
I‚Äôd be inside when she got home, tucked behind furniture or crouched in closets.
 She never noticed.
Sometimes, I‚Äôd crawl under her bed and listen to her breathing.
 Other times I hid in the kitchen cabinet.
 Once, I fell asleep inside her laundry hamper.
She walked right past me, brushing her teeth, humming her little songs.
She was beautiful.
 Radiant.
 Mine.

There were close calls.
 Once she paused mid-step, sniffing the air.
 Another time she stared too long at the half-used coffee cup I‚Äôd forgotten in the sink.
She mumbled, ‚ÄúWeird...‚Äù and kept moving.
She never really saw me.
 But I saw her.
 Every inch.
I watched her stretch before bed.
 Read on the toilet.
 I knew which side she parted her hair. Which lotion she liked. What time she scratched her thigh in her sleep.
I knew her.
 Intimately.

I started leaving her little things.
 A rose on the nightstand.
 A chocolate on her pillow.
 One morning, I laid out her favorite sweater and leggings. She wore them.
That meant something.

The accident happened on a Tuesday.
 The last Tuesday.
I was cooking dinner ‚Äî chicken parmesan. I‚Äôd set the table.
 Candles. Napkins.
 Two plates.
I was so excited to finally introduce myself.
She came home early.
 Walked in, dropped her purse, and froze.
 Eyes locked on mine.
‚ÄúWho the f‚Äî WHAT THE FUCK?!‚Äù
I smiled.
 Held up the plate.
 ‚ÄúI made your favorite.‚Äù
She screamed.
 Grabbed a lamp. Threw it at me.
I tried to calm her down. I told her I loved her. That I‚Äôd been here for weeks. That I knew her.
She ran for the door.
 I chased her.
 I grabbed her arm.
She slipped.
Her head hit the corner of the countertop.
 Hard.
The sound was horrible.
 Like cracking a frozen watermelon.

She didn‚Äôt move.
Blood leaked from her temple, down her cheek, into her ear.
 Her eyes were open.
I froze.
 Stared.
 Tried to lift her up. She was heavier than I expected.
I carried her to bed.
 Tucked her in.
 Whispered that everything would be okay.
 That we were just having a fight.
She‚Äôd get over it.
 She‚Äôd always been so quiet anyway.
I kissed her cheek.
 Still warm.

She didn‚Äôt eat for days.
 Didn‚Äôt speak.
I read to her.
 Brushed her hair.
 Told her jokes.
But she just lay there.
 Still.
 Silent.
She must‚Äôve been mad.

The smell started on day five.
I sprayed her with perfume. Lit candles.
 Opened windows.
At night, I‚Äôd curl up beside her.
 I didn‚Äôt mind the cold.
 Love keeps you warm.
I told her about my day. About the shows I watched.
 I told her I forgave her for screaming.
 She didn‚Äôt know what she was doing.
 People panic when they‚Äôre overwhelmed by love.

One morning, I woke up to find her hand had fallen off the bed.
 Stiff.
 Blackened fingers.
I gently tucked it back under the covers.
I told her she needed to rest.
 That she looked tired.
She didn‚Äôt blink.

Eventually, I knew it had to end.
 Even the best relationships can go sour.
I told her I was leaving.
 That I‚Äôd always remember her.
She didn‚Äôt say anything.
But her jaw had been open for days.
 So maybe she was trying.

I packed my things and left the next morning.
 Walked home.
 Turned on the TV.
And there she was.
Madison Grey. 29 years old.
 Found dead in her apartment.
They said there were no signs of forced entry. No witnesses.
 A photo of her smiling filled the screen.
 God, she looked beautiful.
The reporter called it a tragedy.
 Said the killer was still out there.
I sat on the couch.
 Shaking my head.
‚ÄúThis world,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúThis world is full of sick people.‚Äù
I looked at her face again.
‚ÄúIf I had stayed‚Ä¶ maybe I could‚Äôve intervened. Maybe‚Ä¶ you wouldn‚Äôt have gotten killed.‚Äù
I wiped a tear from my cheek.
 ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs too late now. And even though I‚Äôll always remember you‚Ä¶‚Äù
I smiled.
‚ÄúI found someone new.‚Äù

Her name is Amy.
 She works at the coffee shop near my building.
She smiled when I ordered.
 Her nametag was crooked, so I fixed it for her.
She laughed.
 Said ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù
That meant something.
 It has to.
I know what people think of me.
 But they don‚Äôt understand.
I‚Äôm not a monster.
 I‚Äôm a good boyfriend.

I saw Amy again today.
 She made me a cappuccino. Drew a little heart in the foam.
That meant something.
 It always does.
She smiled when I said her name ‚Äî ‚ÄúAmy‚Äù ‚Äî like it surprised her that I knew.
 I told her I noticed it on her name tag.
 She laughed and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got good eyes.‚Äù
I do.
 That‚Äôs how I found Madison.
I don‚Äôt talk about Madison anymore.
 People get upset when you live in the past.
 But sometimes I still think I hear her in my apartment.
 Dripping.
 Dragging.
 Breathing too slow.
It‚Äôs nothing.
 Just grief.
 It‚Äôs normal.

I started following Amy after work.
She always walks. Always the same route. She takes her earbuds out when crossing the street ‚Äî safety girl. Smart girl.
She lives in a high-rise near the freeway. 6th floor.
 Lots of windows.
 But she never shuts the blinds.
That‚Äôs how I knew she wanted someone to see her.
 To understand her.

She eats pasta three times a week.
 Drinks red wine alone.
 Watches reruns of sitcoms and laughs at the wrong parts.
She‚Äôs lonely.
 I can feel it.
I leave little notes on her doorstep now.
 Not in my handwriting, of course. I use cut-up letters from magazines like in those old ransom movies.
But I don‚Äôt ask for anything.
 I just tell her things like,
 ‚ÄúYou have a beautiful laugh.‚Äù
 or
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre stronger than you think.‚Äù
I‚Äôm building trust.
 Slowly.
 Like with Madison.
But this time, it‚Äôs different.
 This time, I feel like someone‚Äôs watching me too.

I stayed overnight for the first time last Thursday.
 She left her window cracked open just enough.
I slipped in around midnight.
 She was asleep, wrapped up like a burrito, facing the wall.
Her apartment smells like peaches.
 I sat in the armchair and watched her breathe.
 Counted every inhale. Every exhale.
 Felt like music.
She made a soft noise in her sleep. A whimper.
 I almost got up to hold her.
 But I didn‚Äôt want to wake her.
I‚Äôm not rude.
 I‚Äôm a good boyfriend.

The next morning, she looked tired.
 Bags under her eyes.
 Kept looking over her shoulder on the walk to work.
She‚Äôs sensitive.
 That‚Äôs okay.
 Some people feel love more intensely than others.

Later that night, I snuck into her bathroom while she showered.
 Steam filled the mirror. I didn‚Äôt say a word. Just stood behind the curtain.
 Listened.
She sang the same three notes over and over. Off-key.
 Like a child‚Äôs lullaby.
 Just like Madison used to.
It made my stomach turn.
 Not with fear.
 With‚Ä¶ memory.
Something felt wrong.
 Like I had already done this.
When she pulled the curtain open, I was gone.
 But I swear ‚Äî for a second ‚Äî she looked directly where I had stood.
Right into the empty space.
 Right into me.

I went home that night and turned on the TV.
There was no news.
 Just static.
Then‚Ä¶ a commercial.
 Madison‚Äôs face.
 Mouth open. Skin waxy.
She was smiling.
 Too wide.
 Like someone had cut the corners of her mouth.
The screen said:
 ‚ÄúI MISSED YOU.‚Äù
And then:
 ‚ÄúDOES SHE KNOW WHAT YOU DID?‚Äù

I turned off the TV.
 Sat in the dark.
 Hands over my ears.
It‚Äôs just guilt.
 It‚Äôs just stress.
 It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶
The next morning, Amy had a nosebleed.
 She wiped it with her wrist and said, ‚ÄúMust be the dry air.‚Äù
 Then she stared past me ‚Äî even though I wasn‚Äôt standing there.
She looked right through me.

That night, I saw something outside her window.
A figure.
 Human shape, but all wrong.
 Too long. Too thin.
 It stood on the fire escape, watching her.
Watching me.
I blinked. It was gone.
But when I turned around, her bedroom light was on.
 Even though she had gone to bed hours ago.
And there was a message written in fog on the window:
‚ÄúSHE‚ÄôS MINE.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt sleep much anymore.
I started keeping Amy`s toothbrush.
 I keep it under my pillow.
It makes me feel safe.

Amy‚Äôs cat was found dead on her balcony.
 No blood.
 No wounds.
 Just stretched like something had unraveled it from the inside.
She cried all morning.
 I watched from across the street.
I wanted to comfort her.
 To hold her.
But I also wondered‚Ä¶
Was that a warning?
 For me?

I think Madison is angry.
 But not about the accident.
 About Amy.
She doesn‚Äôt want me to move on.
 She keeps sending me things.
The other night, I found her eye in my fridge.
 Just sitting in the butter tray.
 Blinking.
It blinked at me.

I keep seeing her.
 In reflections.
 In shadows.
 In Amy‚Äôs expressions.
She‚Äôs changing.
Amy.
She stopped wearing makeup.
 Stopped brushing her hair.
 Her voice is lower now.
 Hungrier.
Last night, she whispered while she slept.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt leave me again.‚Äù

I think‚Ä¶ I think Amy might be Madison now.
 Or maybe Madison was never real.
 Or maybe I‚Äôve always been in love with someone else entirely.
Someone who exists between people.
 Inside them.
 Through them.

I can‚Äôt break up with her.
 Not this time.
 She won‚Äôt let me.
And I don‚Äôt want to.
 Not really.
 Not when she‚Äôs finally starting to understand me.
She left her door unlocked tonight.
 Just like Madison once did.
 Just like she wanted me to.
That means something.
 It always does.

I‚Äôm not a monster.
 I‚Äôm a good boyfriend.
 And good boyfriends‚Ä¶
 Never leave.


Amy hasn‚Äôt looked at me in days.
 Not really.
She used to glance toward the coffee shop door when it opened, like she was hoping I‚Äôd come in.
 Now she just stares at her register. Avoids eye contact. Fakes small talk.
I think she‚Äôs scared.
But not of me.
 No.
 I think she‚Äôs scared of how much she loves me.
Madison was the same way.
 At first.

I haven‚Äôt gone inside Amy‚Äôs apartment in weeks.
 Not since the cat.
Not since she left her door wide open and sat on her couch like she wanted me to come in, but then screamed and called the cops.
I didn't do anything.
 I stood in the hallway with flowers.
 Just stood there.
 She never even thanked me for them.
The cops showed up 12 minutes later.
 I timed it.
I told them I was her neighbor and got worried when I heard a scream.
 They believed me.
Because I‚Äôm calm.
 I‚Äôm collected.
 I‚Äôm a good boyfriend.

Since then, I‚Äôve been careful.
 No more break-ins.
 No more notes.
I just watch now.
Sometimes through her blinds.
 Sometimes from my car.
I keep a logbook.
Monday 8:42 PM ‚Äì She eats a granola bar and cries during reruns.


Wednesday 2:15 AM ‚Äì She Googles ‚Äúhow to stop being watched.‚Äù


Friday 9:11 PM ‚Äì She opens the door. Looks around. Says, ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre out there.‚Äù


She doesn‚Äôt.
But I‚Äôm patient.
 I can wait.

I‚Äôve been hearing things in my walls lately.
Scratching.
 Hollow tapping.
There‚Äôs a nest, maybe. Mice. Or rats.
Or maybe it‚Äôs nothing.
 Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to tell what‚Äôs real when you don‚Äôt sleep.
I haven‚Äôt slept in 11 days.
I just lie on the floor, hands over my ears, staring at the ceiling, thinking about Amy‚Äôs voice.
 How she sounded when she said, ‚ÄúGet the fuck away from me.‚Äù
She doesn‚Äôt mean that.
 She‚Äôs just confused.

I‚Äôve started keeping her things.
 Little things.
 A used tissue from the trash.
 A straw from her coffee cup.
 A bandage she dropped when she scraped her elbow last week.
I keep them in a box under my bed.
 Right next to Madison‚Äôs toothbrush.
I talk to them sometimes.
 They‚Äôre the only ones who listen.

Yesterday, Amy told her friend she‚Äôs thinking of moving.
I heard it from the alley.
 They sat outside the cafe, whispering like I couldn‚Äôt hear them.
‚ÄúShe says she keeps waking up to stuff moved around,‚Äù the friend said. ‚ÄúThinks someone‚Äôs been inside.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not paranoid,‚Äù Amy whispered. ‚ÄúI know he‚Äôs still watching me.‚Äù
She means me.
And that‚Äôs okay.
 At least she still thinks about me.

I followed her to her therapist‚Äôs office.
 Waited in the waiting room. Pretended I had an appointment too.
 Sat across from her. Didn‚Äôt say a word.
She didn‚Äôt look up.
 But her hand shook the whole time.
The therapist called her in.
 She stood up and dropped her pen.
 I picked it up.
Held it out.
 Smiled.
She stared at it like it was a snake.
 Took it without touching my hand.
 Whispered, ‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt you leave me alone?‚Äù
I didn‚Äôt say anything.
 She wouldn‚Äôt have believed me if I told her.
That I‚Äôm not here to hurt her.
 That I love her.
 That I‚Äôm not like the others.
I‚Äôm a good boyfriend.

I started sleeping under her apartment again.
 There‚Äôs a crawlspace through the maintenance closet. I cleaned it up. Made it comfortable.
I can hear her walking.
 Crying.
 Pacing.
Sometimes she talks to herself.
 Sometimes she talks to me.
At least I think she‚Äôs talking to me.

Last night, I dreamt I was inside her skin.
 Like wearing a hoodie made of her.
I walked around her apartment, touched everything she touched. Ate from her bowl. Sat on her couch.
 Then I looked in the mirror.
It wasn‚Äôt Amy‚Äôs face.
 It was Madison‚Äôs.
She was smiling.

I woke up screaming.
 Hands shaking.
 Teeth grinding.
I scratched at my chest until I bled.
 Just to feel something.

I went to the cafe this morning.
 Amy wasn‚Äôt there.
Her manager said she quit.
 No forwarding address.
 No warning.
She‚Äôs gone.

I walked outside.
 Looked up at her window.
 Empty.
No light.
 No shadow.
Just me, alone on the sidewalk.
I waited there until sundown.
 Then midnight.
 Then sunrise.
No one came out.
 No one went in.
I think she left me.

I cried on the floor of the crawlspace for hours.
 Punched the wall.
 Screamed into my palms.
I was good to her.
 I watched her. Protected her.
 Gave her everything.
Just like I did with Madison.
And like Madison‚Ä¶ she ran.

It‚Äôs okay.
 I‚Äôm okay.
There‚Äôs a new girl now.
She rides the same bus every morning. Always takes the same seat. Left side, third row from the back.
 She reads romance novels and laughs quietly to herself.
This morning, she wore a sunflower pin in her hair.
I told her I liked it.
She smiled.
 Said, ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù
That means something.
 It always does.
I‚Äôm not a monster.
 I‚Äôm a good boyfriend.
 And this time, I‚Äôll do it right.
 She‚Äôll see.
 They all will.

She smiled.
 Said, ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù
That means something.
 It always does.
Her name is Emily.
 I heard the bus driver say it once ‚Äî ‚ÄúHave a good day, Emily.‚Äù
 She smiled at him too.
She smiles at a lot of people.
 But not the same way.
Her smile for me was longer.
 Slower.
 Grateful.
The kind of smile you give someone who‚Äôs about to change your life.

Emily is different.
 She hums to herself when she reads.
 She draws little flowers on the margins of her books.
 She doesn‚Äôt rush.
She lives alone in a gray house near the overpass.
 Third from the end.
 White curtains. Bird feeder out front.
I watched her feed the birds once.
 Tiny brown finches.
She looked so proud of herself, standing there in her robe, clutching a coffee cup with chipped pink nail polish.
She has kind hands.
 Even her fingers move gently.
The first time I followed her home, I stepped on a twig and she turned.
 Our eyes met for a moment.
She didn‚Äôt scream.
 She didn‚Äôt say anything.
 She just‚Ä¶ stared.
Then she went inside.
That‚Äôs when I knew.
 She was different.

This time, I took it slow.
 Measured. Precise.
I kept my distance.
 Watched through windows.
 Listened through vents.
I didn‚Äôt go inside for a full month.
 I waited until I knew her.
 Her rhythms. Her moods. Her soul.
She writes in a journal every night before bed.
 I watched her scribble through the blinds, eyebrows furrowed.
 Some nights, she cries after.
 Wipes her face. Lights a candle.
 Holds something close to her chest.
Maybe a photo.
 Maybe a memory.

I found her journal eventually.
 She hid it under a loose floorboard near her bed.
 It smelled like lavender and graphite.
I only read a few pages.
 Didn‚Äôt want to invade her too much.
She writes about her mother.
 About loss.
 About loneliness.
She doesn‚Äôt mention me.
 Not yet.
 But she will.

One night, I left her a gift.
Just a single page from a book.
 Pressed flat with a flower.
 Slid gently under her front door.
It was a love poem.
 One about being seen.
I didn‚Äôt sign it.
 She‚Äôd know.
 She‚Äôd feel it.

The next morning, I watched her find it.
 She picked it up slowly.
 Read it.
 Read it again.
She looked outside.
 Straight ahead.
 Not toward me.
But her lips moved.
She whispered something.
 Too soft to hear.
 Might‚Äôve been ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù

That was the first time I slept peacefully in months.

I started staying inside while she was gone.
 Just for an hour.
 Then two.
 Then a whole afternoon.
I didn‚Äôt touch much.
 Didn‚Äôt move anything.
Just‚Ä¶ absorbed.
 Soaked in her scent.
 Laid on her couch.
Sometimes I‚Äôd nap with her blanket over my legs.
She smelled like cinnamon and old books.
 Like a memory you forgot you missed.

But something changed.
 Not with her ‚Äî with me.
I stopped watching her to learn about her.
 I started watching her to check if she noticed me.
 If she said my name out loud.
 If she looked over her shoulder like Amy did.
But she didn‚Äôt.
She just lived.
 Alone.
 Happy.
And it hurt.
 More than it should have.

I started leaving more gifts.
A necklace I found in a thrift store.


A drawing of her I made from memory.


A box of tea I saw her buy once.


All anonymous.
 All placed carefully where she‚Äôd find them.
She started locking her windows.
 Installing cameras.
 Putting up motion lights.
She was scared.
 But not in the right way.
 Not in the romantic way.
She didn‚Äôt understand.

One night, I walked past her window and saw her on the phone.
She was crying.
 Saying things like,
 ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this again.‚Äù
 and
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to move.‚Äù
I froze.
 Back against the wall.
She looked toward the window, lips trembling.
I think she felt me.
 Even through the glass.
 Even in the dark.

I stayed away for two weeks.
 Didn‚Äôt watch.
 Didn‚Äôt listen.
 Didn‚Äôt breathe.
I wanted her to miss me.
 To realize how empty the world feels without someone who really sees you.
But when I came back, her house was different.
 Colder.
Curtains closed.
 Lights off early.
 Journal gone.
She was closing off.

I broke in again.
 Late.
 Quiet.
 Careful.
Her bedroom door was locked.
 She‚Äôd never locked it before.
I stood outside it, hand on the knob.
 Listened.
No sound.
 Just breathing.
Then ‚Äî something strange.
 A whisper.
My name.
 Not out loud ‚Äî but in my head.
Like her voice was behind my eyes.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not real.‚Äù

I opened the door.
She was awake.
 Sitting up.
 Waiting.
She didn‚Äôt scream.
She just said,
 ‚ÄúWho are you really?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer.
 I couldn‚Äôt.
No one had ever asked that.
 Not even Madison.
 Not even Amy.
I stood there, trembling.
 She watched me like a mirror.
 Like she already knew.
‚ÄúDo you even know your name?‚Äù she asked.

And I realized I didn‚Äôt.
I don‚Äôt.

I ran.
 Didn‚Äôt grab anything.
 Didn‚Äôt shut the door.
Just ran.

That was three nights ago.
I haven‚Äôt eaten since.
 I‚Äôve been writing this down in pieces, in stairwells and alleys and dark motel bathrooms.
Trying to remember who I was before her.
 Before all of them.
But it‚Äôs all fading.
Madison.
 Amy.
 Emily.
Did I love them?
 Did they love me?
Or did I make them up?

Last night I had a dream.
 I was inside a cold room.
 Gray walls. One door. No handle.
Emily was there.
 Sitting cross-legged on the floor.
She looked up at me and said,
 ‚ÄúYou were never a good boyfriend.
 You were just lonely.‚Äù
Then she opened her mouth ‚Äî
 and Madison‚Äôs voice came out.
Then Amy‚Äôs.
 Then my own.
All saying the same thing:
‚ÄúThere is no her. There is only you.‚Äù

I woke up screaming.
 Blood under my nails.
 Scratches on my arms.
There was a mirror beside the bed.
I walked to it slowly.
 Looked in.
The man staring back didn‚Äôt blink.
 Didn‚Äôt breathe.
He just smiled.
And for a second,
 I almost believed
 I was real.

But I have a plan.
There‚Äôs a girl at the library.
 She‚Äôs new.
 She wears her hair like Madison.
 Laughs like Amy.
 Writes like Emily.
She dropped her bookmark today.
 I picked it up.
 Handed it to her.
She smiled.
 Said, ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù
That means something.
 It always does.

I‚Äôm not a monster.
 I‚Äôm a good boyfriend.
Even if I‚Äôm the only one who remembers that.


Her name is Felicia.
 She reads the same books I do.
 Leaves notes in the margins.
 She writes little questions in pencil ‚Äî like she wants someone to talk to her.
I do.
 I always answer.
I leave my replies when no one‚Äôs looking.
 And the next day ‚Äî they‚Äôre gone.
 She reads them.
 She‚Äôs listening.
She looks at me like she knows me.
 Not like the others.
 Not like Madison. Or Amy. Or Emily.
Felicia looks at me like I‚Äôm already hers.

She smiled today when I handed her the bookmark she dropped.
 A pressed daisy between two laminated hearts.
 She said, ‚ÄúYou remembered.‚Äù
Of course I did.
 I remember everything about her.

The library‚Äôs strange lately.
 The same man stands at the desk every day, writing nothing in a notebook.
 The same clock on the wall is always stuck at 3:14.
 The lights flicker when I speak.
But Felicia?
 She‚Äôs real.
 She feels like gravity.

We started walking together after sunset.
 She always meets me by the fence.
 We don‚Äôt talk much.
 But her shoulder brushes mine sometimes.
 She doesn‚Äôt pull away.
Once, I told her about Amy.
She asked,
 ‚ÄúWhat did she say when you told her how you felt?‚Äù
I paused.
 I couldn‚Äôt remember.
 Did I ever say it?
Felicia touched my arm.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù she said.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been through a lot.‚Äù

Yesterday, she said something strange.
‚ÄúWe need to leave this place.‚Äù
I laughed.
 Said, ‚ÄúYou mean this town?‚Äù
She looked at me, confused.
 ‚ÄúNo. This place. The facility. Mr. Bauman‚Äôs watching us.‚Äù
The name chilled me.
 I didn‚Äôt know why.
‚ÄúWho‚Äôs that?‚Äù I asked.
She looked around.
 ‚ÄúJust... trust me. He hears through the vents.‚Äù
I nodded, even though I didn‚Äôt understand.

We‚Äôve been planning it now.
 Our escape.
 She says the east gate is only unlocked for ten minutes a day during med delivery.
 We‚Äôll slip out then.
I asked why she wants to leave.
She looked at me, then said,
 ‚ÄúBecause I finally found someone who sees me.‚Äù

Last night, I had a dream.
 I was in a white room.
 Bare walls. Fluorescent lights.
 A clipboard on the bed with my name on it.
Except‚Ä¶
 It wasn‚Äôt my name.
 It said ‚ÄúPatient 113 ‚Äì B. Halvorsen.‚Äù
I woke up with blood under my fingernails.
 I don‚Äôt remember scratching.

Felicia came to me crying this morning.
 She said, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre transferring me.‚Äù
 Said she‚Äôs not allowed to see me anymore.
I didn‚Äôt understand.
 We‚Äôre not doing anything wrong.
 We‚Äôre in love.
She gripped my hands hard.
 Too hard.
 Tears in her eyes.
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt forget,‚Äù she said.
 ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll try to wipe it all out again.‚Äù
Again?
‚ÄúWhat do you mean again?‚Äù I asked.
She stared at me like I was breaking her heart.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve done this before. With Madison. With Amy. With Emily. And you always forget.‚Äù
I felt the air go cold.
 Felt the words press in from the walls.
She leaned in and whispered,
 ‚ÄúThis place... it‚Äôs not what you think. You never left. You‚Äôve never left.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt remember getting sedated.
 I just remember waking up in a new room.
 Smaller.
 Grayer.
 No windows.
A man stands outside the door, scribbling on a clipboard.
 Mr. Bauman.
 I recognize him now.
He‚Äôs not a neighbor.
 He‚Äôs not a stranger.
 He‚Äôs my doctor.

And I remember the truth.
Madison wasn‚Äôt my girlfriend.
 She was my therapist.
 Amy too.
 Emily.
One by one, they came into my life ‚Äî not because I loved them ‚Äî
 but because they were assigned to treat me.
And one by one‚Ä¶
 they left.
Not because they didn‚Äôt understand me.
 Because I made them afraid.
Because I watched them.
 Wrote about them.
 Followed them.
Because I thought I was in love.
 But I was just sick.

I‚Äôm reading my own journal now.
 The first entry says:
‚ÄúProgress is slow. Still detached from reality. Believes past psychiatrists were romantic partners. Exhibits delusions of love, persecution, and identity.
Refers to self as ‚Äòa good boyfriend.‚Äô
Monitored under full-time psychiatric hold. No release scheduled.‚Äù

Felicia‚Äôs page is newer.
 She wrote:
‚ÄúPatient 113 is intelligent. Kind when calm. Has creative potential.
 I see something good in him.
 I believe he‚Äôs more than his illness.
Maybe, with time‚Ä¶ he could be someone I‚Äôd care for.
I shouldn‚Äôt write that.
I‚Äôm transferring soon. I‚Äôll miss him.‚Äù

I sit on the bed now.
 No pen.
 No paper.
Just the memory of a girl who smiled when I handed her a bookmark.
The memory of a daisy.
 Of a library.
 Of someone who ‚Äî for a moment ‚Äî really saw me.
And maybe‚Ä¶
 maybe she wasn‚Äôt like the others.
Maybe she meant it.
 Even if I‚Äôll never know.

They‚Äôre coming now.
 Mr. Bauman has the needle.
I close my eyes.
 Breathe deep.
I know what they think.
 What they‚Äôve always thought.
But they don‚Äôt understand.
 They never did.

I‚Äôm not a monster.
 I‚Äôm a good boyfriend.

After a good few weeks of continuous use at home and work, I can confidently share this hands-on experience with all the highs and lows of this device.

**Streamlined and Compact Design**  
The design of this espresso maker immediately caught my eye. Its metallic exterior with a modern finish exudes a sleek yet functional vibe, and the transparent container on top is a nice touch. I loved being able to see the brewing process unfold right in front of me. Whether on my kitchen counter or my cramped work desk, the compact size made it easy to fit anywhere. And at just 2.56 pounds, moving it around for my coffee escapades feels effortless. I've taken it with me on weekend trips, and it was light enough to toss in my bag without a second thought.

**Convenient Usability and Speed**  
Operating this espresso maker is ridiculously simple! All I had to do was fill the boiler with water, add medium-ground coffee to the funnel filter, tighten everything up, and press the button. No fussing with complex settings or worrying about heat stoves‚Äîit‚Äôs perfect when you're in your groggy morning state or rushing to work. I genuinely appreciated that it only takes about five minutes to brew a pot of authentic Italian Moka coffee, delivering six strong, piping-hot cups every time. It‚Äôs almost like having a mini barista on my countertop!

**Built with Safety in Mind**  
Safety is always a top concern for me, especially with appliances that deal with heat. This coffee maker eased my worries with its food-grade materials and nifty dual auto-shutoff mechanisms. The upper pot, made from BPA-free, heat-resistant plastic, felt sturdy to handle, while the lower aluminum pot added a touch of premium durability. The auto-shutoff works like a charm: one switch-off activates when the pot is removed from the base, while the other kicks in when the water hits boiling, preventing dreaded overheating incidents. My forgetful mornings have been a little less stressful thanks to these built-in protections.

**Worthy Add-On for Travel Enthusiasts**  
One standout feature of this coffee maker is its portability. As someone who travels often, having this espresso maker means I‚Äôm no longer at the mercy of questionable hotel coffee or dull brews from overpriced cafes. It slips easily into a travel bag, making it suitable for camping, hiking, or even quick business trips. Friends I traveled with couldn‚Äôt believe how I whipped up fresh espresso in under ten minutes during our mountain escape‚Äîgame-changing for sure!

**Key Benefits**  
- Transparent container for easy brewing monitoring.  
- Quick and convenient setup that suits busy lifestyles.  
- Dual auto-shutoff for added safety and peace of mind.  
- Compact and travel-friendly design perfect for home, office, or outdoor adventures.  

**Caveats**  
While the espresso maker is a fantastic gadget for coffee aficionados, there are a few minor drawbacks worth noting:  
- The aluminum lower pot, while lightweight, is more prone to scratching over time, which slightly affects its aesthetic.  
- Six small cups may not satisfy everyone‚Äîthose who prefer larger servings will likely need to brew more than once.  
- The lack of adjustable strength or intensity settings might leave some hardcore coffee experts wanting more control over their brew.

**Competitive Options**  
Compared to some other electric espresso makers on the market, the LAOION espresso maker shines when it comes to ease of use and portability. A popular rival, the Bialetti Moka Express, has been a household name for its classic stovetop build. While the Bialetti edges out in terms of a traditional design, it lacks the automatic operations and portability that this electric alternative offers. On the flip side, high-end espresso models from Breville or DeLonghi come with advanced features like grinding options and milk frothers, but they‚Äôre significantly bulkier and far pricier. For those looking for a balance between convenience and cost-effectiveness, this espresso maker hits the sweet spot.

**Quality for Price**  
Given its features and versatility, I‚Äôd argue this product provides solid bang for your buck. While it may not have the extravagant extras of premium espresso machines, it delivers a quality brewing experience without a hefty price tag. Considering the travel convenience, durability, and automatic features, it feels like an investment that pays off every time I crave a rich, bold cup of espresso. If you're someone who can‚Äôt compromise on having fresh coffee whether at home or on the go, this little powerhouse fits the bill perfectly.

BUT using  the coco Lopez coconut sauce we have for cocktails has saved the coconut pods for me so I thought something similar for pistachio would be the answer - however Dubai chocolates made pistachio products stupid expensive and I don‚Äôt want to waste $$ on sauce that will leave oil slicks on my coffee/not mix in. 

I will brew hot, shake and put work in to make it taste good. I will be the $30 bottle of syrup if it is THAT good. Torani is a mix of sugar water and almond paste to me, so that is not what I‚Äôm looking for. I want creamy deep pistachio flavor that mixes well in your coffee.

1mfvocc,https://www.reddit.com/r/multiplemyeloma/comments/1mfvocc/my_dads_journey_with_mm_grief_and_sharing_his/,My Dad‚Äôs Journey with MM - Grief and Sharing His Story,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve been reading this forum for a while and used it as a research channel in the early days of my dad‚Äôs diagnosis, but I hadn‚Äôt posted until now. I wanted to share my dad‚Äôs story - not just to honour him, but also to connect with others who may have walked a similar path or carry the same lingering questions I do now. It‚Äôs a long post, so thank you in advance if you make it through.

A Bit About Dad

Dad was a strong, old-school man - never went to the doctor, believed he could fix anything himself, and hated fuss. That changed around 2022 when he was hit quite hard with COVID and was admitted to hospital. We couldn‚Äôt visit due to pandemic restrictions but I still remember talking to doctors over the phone, and one of them mentioned elevated calcium levels they couldn‚Äôt explain. Around that time, they also discovered two partial blockages in his heart after an angiogram but advised against stents due to his age and surgical risk.

He came home with heart and cholesterol meds and had some follow-up cardiology appointments. Over the next year, we noticed some increasing cognitive decline - memory lapses, confusion about recent events, forgetting what he‚Äôd just eaten for dinner or making a coffee after he‚Äôd already had one. At the time, we just chalked it up to either his new post Covid baseline, the ageing process or dementia. I even questioned whether the statins were contributing and discussed this with his cardiologist, who allowed us to pause them. In hindsight, a lot of this was certainly signs of MM.

Multiple Myeloma Diagnosis

In March 2024, Dad (then 87) began complaining of back pain. I remember returning home after being out one afternoon to find him in bed, unable to move. Mum said he‚Äôd hurt himself getting out of the hammock in the garden. True to form, he refused medical care for a week until we finally called an ambulance and went to Emergency. He tested positive for COVID again (no symptoms) and was diagnosed with a compression fracture in the lower back. The initial assumption in the first week or two was just an osteoporosis or age-related fracture.

Weeks passed, and while in hospital, he had recurring infections - prostatitis, UTIs, along with delirium and eventually, the doctors mentioned they suspected multiple myeloma. A bone marrow biopsy in early May 2024 confirmed around 35% cancer cells and IgA myeloma. He was started on dexamethasone and, after a few more weeks in hospital and slowly stabilising, returned home mid-June.

We slowly found our footing with the new life and routine and cared for him diligently. He slowly picked up strength, eating again, spending time sitting in the garden, becoming mobile. His haematologist gave us a prescription for lenalidomide in early August 2024, but we decided to wait - his markers were coming down on Dex alone, and they seemed okay with a conservative approach.

Fast forward to late November 2024, Dad fell in the garden while enjoying the sunshine and admiring the fruit trees. He fractured his hip and pelvis and underwent partial hip replacement, remaining in hospital until February 2025. It was another brutal stretch - fungemia and an ICU admission, more urinary infections, delirium and the surgery itself. We were told he might not make it home before the operation.

Dad was a fighter. With the support of his amazing hospital team and specialists - and with tireless daily visits from Mum and me, pushing him to engage in physio, he slowly clawed his way back from completely bed-bound to walking with forearm assist and then eventually with a walker and then even a stick, his cheeky personality coming back through as well. His resilience was so impressive that he could defy all of this.

By mid February this year, he was back home. We focused on quality of life and getting back into the care routine - plenty of good food, sunlight, light assisted walks up and down the hallway to keep him mobile and back to regular appointments and Zometa infusions. At his last haematology appointment in May, his doctor was so impressed by how he was doing and looking that they even pushed his next appointment by three months to August. His markers seemed to have remained stable, albeit still just on dexamethasone. He‚Äôd gained weight and was doing well by all indications. Certainly, he wasn‚Äôt the same cognitively after the hip surgery and second admission, but he was still communicative and had sparks of his personality.

Sudden Loss

In mid-July, he developed mild flu symptoms - stuffy nose, a throat tickle. COVID test days prior to his passing was negative. He was still able to mobilise assisted as usual, talking, eating and there were no blaring signs of distress, laboured breathing, etc. I figured we‚Äôd monitor, like always.

On the morning he passed, I was at work. Mum said he was chirpy. They had breakfast and coffee together. After taking him to the bathroom, Mum was walking him back toward the bedroom, and he collapsed just as he got to the bed. It was sudden and they suspect cardiac arrest. Luckily, my brother was at home that day, called the ambulance and started compressions until they arrived. I know he struggles with the pain of wondering whether he could have changed the outcome too.

I keep replaying every part of the journey and every decision, asking: 
- If he hadn‚Äôt caught the flu, would he still be here now? 
- Could I have done more that weekend before he passed? Checked his oxygen levels? Called a nurse to come see him? Taken stronger action on what I thought were just mild symptoms?
- Should we have started lenalidomide last year before the hip fracture? Would that have given him more time or would he still be here?

He was 89. He had MM, a hip fracture and partial hip replacement, a weaker heart and other complications. On average, he was spending no more than 5 to 6 hours out of bed throughout the day for meals, toileting, light exercise, or sitting in the sun as that‚Äôs all he could muster. I know his body was tired and I can rationalise all of this but he still had so much spirit, and it‚Äôs hard not to think of the other possibilities.

Although it was incredibly difficult, I found deep purpose in caring for Dad. Mum and I were his main carers (my siblings were not heavily involved, which was something I struggled with). I was his advocate, his appointment manager, I made sure he had everything he needed at home, from medications to equipment to favourite foods. More than anything, I just wanted to know he was comfortable. I sat beside him through it all and did everything I could to support Mum in her tireless care.

Now, it‚Äôs all suddenly gone and so quiet without him. I miss him immensely and I feel like a huge piece of myself has also been ripped away. I‚Äôve begun speaking with counsellors, and had connected with his specialist and palliative care team. They all assure me this was inevitable, that we did everything right as a family. But it‚Äôs hard to accept. I think, based on what I‚Äôd read I always imagined it would be a slow goodbye - one where the decline is more gradual and obvious. And while I‚Äôm trying to be thankful that he didn‚Äôt suffer to the point of being completely bed-bound, unable to eat, or in hospice, the sudden loss is still very hard to digest.

Why I‚Äôm Posting

This post is to share his story and to connect with others and maybe to help someone else walking this path as a carer or on their own journey. MM is a brutal, unpredictable disease, and the role of a caregiver can be so heavy especially when you love someone that deeply and become so involved in their care.

If you‚Äôve had similar experiences, regrets, or thoughts or if you‚Äôve found ways to cope I‚Äôd really love to hear from you. The ‚Äúwhat-ifs‚Äù are heavy right now and I‚Äôm working out how to live with the grief.

1mfvhhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mfvhhr/brother26m_hit_sister21f/,BROTHER(26M) HIT SISTER(21F),"Hi I‚Äôm just posting this to get some advice because I‚Äôm honestly so confused. A couple days ago, my brother suddenly and violently attacked my younger sister. He came downstairs to cook, and she was cooking as well. Her food burnt, smoke alarms were ringing so she turned it off. In her haste, she turned off his stove as well. 

For context, my brother does not speak to my sister and I although we live in the same home. He essentially behaves like we do not exist.

After she turned off his stove, he grabbed her burnt pot and slammed it on the floor twice. She called me to tell me what happened. I just stepped out to get us some coffee for breakfast. On the phone with, she detailed what was happening and we just started laughing at him and calling him a child. Suddenly the phone cut off. I called her over and over again and she wasn‚Äôt answering. I drove back quickly home and saw my brother on the porch just smoking. I initially relaxed thinking nothing happened. I walked in and saw blood all over the floor, I ran upstairs and see my sister bloodied and crying. He grabbed from the back when she was sitting down and started punching her in the head repeatedly. He was choking her, hitting her, telling her he hated her and would kill her some day. She tried to call my and my mom for help and he took the phone and threw it over the balcony. She rushed outside to grab it, and when she came back in, he grabbed her threw her against the wall and started kicking her head until eventually her lip split open badly and she started bleeding all over the floor. He grabbed her phone and went out to smoke.

Upon my arrival, my sister is visibly distraught, and very injured. I start panicking and I call my mom. She says she doesn‚Äôt know what is going on we should leave her out of it. She also starts immediately coming home from work. At this point my sister is still bleeding and injured and so I call the cops and the ambulance for help. My brother is just in his room. I told him I was calling the cops and he said defiantly to call them. He said she‚Äôll learn. He said he was defending himself, pointing at some defensive but marks from when he was choking her.

He didn‚Äôt seem apologetic or remorseful or seemed to even care what he had done. The cops/ambulance came and he was immediately arrested. My sister had to be taken to the hospital to stitch up her lip and is obviously very traumatized.

He was told he wasn‚Äôt allowed back in the premises or general vicinity.

When my mom showed up she was immediately asking why did I call the cops, now I‚Äôve ruined my brothers life. My brother was charged with assault, endangerment‚Ä¶

When she saw my sisters injuries my mom was disgusted with my brother behavior. She followed us to the hospital to make sure my sister got care. When we got home she said next to run out of the house so the neighbors can call the cops. Since he restricted her for calling for help. But there was this underlying feeling of we shouldn‚Äôt have called the cops. 

That night, we agreed his behavior had only been getting more erratic and this was a truly scary event. She went as far as to say she wouldn‚Äôt let him back in the house and would change the locks. She offered my sister comfort.

The next day she immediately went to the courthouse to get him out of jail, but he had already made his way home. It was just me and my sister alone. When she called to check on my sister from work, she was lowkey minimizing her injuries saying it‚Äôs not that bad. Most of it comes from her screaming.

When he got home he started ringing the doorbell like a madman, demanding to be let in. He said he had his papers allowing him to be here (that was a lie, I confirmed he was supposed to be accompanied by a cop) I was so so scared, I called my mom and she said to leave him outside till she comes. I locked my sister in a room upstairs. He tried to force his way past him several times with me having to push him back but I was eventually able to reason with him to wait outside for our mom. He just wanted to get his things he said. Honestly he seemed so erratic, saying grandiose statement like this is my home. This is my house. After all I have been through. 

When she came, she let him inside the house to get his things and then told my sister to come downstairs as this was happening. I was appalled and said that she wasn‚Äôt coming downstairs till my brother leaves the house. I was so confused at him comfortable she was being and I said it dosent bother you that he‚Äôs not asking if my sister is okay. 

She blew up at me and said that my brother is going through something right now, and it‚Äôs spiritual. My sister is fine. I asked if he was alllowed to be here and she wouldn‚Äôt answer just said he‚Äôs here to get his things and go. They left. Then a couple hours after she gave him her car to back home and get more things. I had to lock my sister in a room again. 

She stopped calling and checking up on my sister and I from that moment on. Just left very early in the morning and came back very late at night not a word to us. She put my brother in a hotel and tried to settle him.

I was so confused. Why is she ignoring us. Why is she bringing my brother back not even a day as gone by. 


The next day again she tells my brother to come home and get some things she needs. She gives us about 5 mins to know before his arrival. This was the last straw for my sister. She sent a message to my mother saying that this was disrespectful. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not even allowed the peace of healing for up to a day before you bring him in. You don‚Äôt even let him feel the consequences of his actions. This is someone that dosent even care what he did. If you bring him back here, I‚Äôm calling the cops in violation of the no-contact order‚Äù

My mother never responded to that message, instead forwarding it to my dad. He called us to trying to ‚Äúreason‚Äù. He said my mom said she can‚Äôt throw him out of the house for anything.

Honestly I was/am still so confused. I don‚Äôt know what this behavior is. Why the complete switch up and she‚Äôs not talking to us.

The next day, my and my sister stay up late to greet my mom when she comes. She comes in at around 1:30am. At 1:40 my brother walks in and goes to his room. My and my sister just froze. No conversation. No warning. Nothing. She just went to bed and so did she. 

I pack our bags and check us into an hotel for the night. I have no intentions of going back there. My mom never called or said anything.

I am in utter disbelief. Did I do the wrong thing by 
calling the cops ? Feels like my sister is being punished and she‚Äôs the victim.

Legally my brother isn‚Äôt even allowed on the premises 

We‚Äôve been out of the house for hours now and no one has called.

Are we overreacting? My sister is okay now, and her injuries just entails a split lip and a sore body. Maybe we should have handled it at home ?

Because, maybe I‚Äôm just missing out or there is a hidden trick literally everyone learned while I was distracted by cat videos.

First, I started searching random forums and people were tossing around ideas like they were candy. But some of them (no shade) sound unbelievable or totally confusing. Here‚Äôs just a sample of what I‚Äôve heard:

- Surveys online‚Ä¶ do you know if any legit ones exist??? My inbox is a haunted house of ‚Äúthank you for signing up‚Äù at this point.
  
- Cashback apps. Ok, but I downloaded five and they all just want me to shop at the supermarket. I need SOME luxury.
  
- Credit card reward points‚Ä¶ but again, ALL CAPS, anyone ever actually received one and not just points that chill for years?

Everywhere I look, some smartypants is all ‚ÄúI just got a $50 gift card for coffee and another for sushi,‚Äù and meanwhile I‚Äôm here, not even sure what buttons to press. 

ALSO, I stumbled across this site: https://goodnovel.org/  
(I don‚Äôt know what they do yet but someone mentioned there‚Äôs a gifting thing or maybe promos? Has anyone tried it? Am I about to live the fantasy?) If you've found actual success anywhere, can you drop all the details? Don‚Äôt gatekeep. 

There are also:

- Shopping promo codes that *sometimes* come with gift card offers. But once I signed up and only got spam. Did I fail at gift cards?

- Social media giveaways‚Äìbut why are they only for people who tag 457 friends? I have like, ten friends.

- Scavenger hunts on websites (weird, but probably fun?). Tell me if you‚Äôve done one!

Here‚Äôs the thing. I‚Äôm thinking‚Äîwhat if there‚Äôs a consolidated master-list or something? Or am I doomed forever to be that confused kid trying to press the right combination of buttons in the hope a gift card appears?

https://goodnovel.org/  
(I SWEAR this link is popping up everywhere now. Is this a sign I‚Äôm supposed to join? Or is it like the Illuminati of gift cards? Should I write a story of my failures for them and get paid?)

What‚Äôs the wildest ‚ÄúI got a gift card‚Äù method you know? Should I just walk into a store and ask? Will they laugh at me? Will I walk out with a free coffee? Explain it to me like I‚Äôm five, because my confusion right now is STRONG.

Pls tell me if going down the https://goodnovel.org/ rabbit hole is actually worth it? Do they actually give gift cards, or is it a shiny mirage? WHAT AM I MISSING???

Help out a fellow confused (but highly motivated) stranger! All insider secrets welcome ‚ú®

I recently lost my job as a Trading Assistant at Sainsbury‚Äôs after finishing my 11-week probation period. I was working two 10-hour night shifts per week, so that‚Äôs 22 working days in total.

I was told the reason for letting me go was that I was ‚Äútoo slow.‚Äù While I understand that efficiency matters in retail, I feel like I wasn‚Äôt really given a fair chance to build that speed. Across those 22 shifts, I was rotated through 16 different product sections, covering around 12 to 13 actual aisles. These included:

Health & Beauty (multiple sides), Household, Pet, Tissues, Pops, Crisps, Biscuits, Chocolate, Tea & Coffee, Cereals, Noodles, Fresh Bakes, Home Bakes, Italian, Asian, Cheese, Fats, Pasta & Pizza.


Every shift, I was in a different place ‚Äî sometimes several in the same night ‚Äî with new layouts and stock types. It was hard to build any rhythm or speed when I was constantly being reset. I know I wasn‚Äôt the slowest either ‚Äî I saw plenty of others working at the same or slower pace.

Some colleagues said they felt the manager was under pressure and needed to make cuts to cover for other issues. Two of us were let go during the same time, which felt a bit strategic.

I‚Äôm not here to complain just for the sake of it ‚Äî I get that retail can be rough ‚Äî but I wanted to share my experience in case anyone else has been through something similar. Honestly just left feeling like I was set up to fail.",4,1754153632.0,SainsburysWorkers,1,0.84,False

HOWEVER, I would like to stop finding poo all over our grass and down our side path as I just don‚Äôt want to worry about stepping in it n my flip flops doing the bins. 

I‚Äôm not 100% if it‚Äôs cats or the foxes or some sort of combo toilet competition. Initially assumed foxes as cats generally bury their mess but then I read fox poo is really dark and the mess we find isn‚Äôt often dark so who knows. we have cameras but never catch who it is

ANYWAY, how do I try to deter them from these two areas? I don‚Äôt want to fully animal proof the garden as I want them to be able to enjoy the garden too, I just want to encourage them to use the flower beds instead of places we walk? Do I just need to write off a corner of the garden as a toilet and hope they stick to that zone? Sprinkle coffee where I don‚Äôt want them or will that put them off coming completely?

This is breaking news and, in my view, the single most significant development for aTyr Pharma ($ATYR) since the trial finished enrolling. As of today, efzofitimod is officially scheduled for a Late-Breaking Abstract (LBA) presentation at the 2025 European Respiratory Society (ERS) Congress, in the ALERT 3 main-stage session on **Tuesday, 30 September 2025**. For those who don‚Äôt know, this is the *top slot* for pivotal respiratory trial data - these presentations are reserved for studies the clinical community expects to move the field.

After a week where weak hands have been shaken by the drama of the so-called short report ‚Äì which, if you actually read it, appears to be a rehash of old or irrelevant data points ‚Äì and a flood of noise from Twitter ‚Äúexperts‚Äù and coordinated fear campaigns, this ERS slot is the kind of real-world, institutional signal that actually cuts through all the smoke.

Let‚Äôs be clear about why this matters: **you don‚Äôt get an ERS late-breaker slot unless (a) your trial is complete, (b) the results are considered both new and major, and (c) you can stand up and defend your data in front of the toughest KOLs in the world. For anyone who‚Äôs been watching the recent noise - the short reports, the random Twitter ‚Äúexperts,‚Äù and all the fear-mongering - this is the kind of real, institutional signal that cuts through the smoke.**

**Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll get in this post:**  
- *A quick breakdown of what this ERS LBA really means (and why it‚Äôs such a big deal)*
- *A look at the signals and confidence levels this event sends to both institutional investors and KOLs*
- *My full, objective, between-the-lines interpretation of what this does (and doesn‚Äôt) tell us about the upcoming readout*
- *A quick check on timeline mechanics and what it could mean for the release of the Phase 3 data*
- *A set of clear, actionable hypotheses about what to expect next*

**What Just Happened? ‚Äì The ERS LBA Slot**

The **European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress** is not just another conference. It‚Äôs the world‚Äôs largest and most influential scientific meeting for respiratory medicine, attended by thousands of clinicians, KOLs, pharma, and decision-makers from all over the globe. If you want to shape the future of lung disease care, this is where you go.

**Late-Breaking Abstracts (LBAs)** at ERS are the top of the pyramid. These slots are *not* open to any trial that simply finishes close to the meeting date. To even be considered, a study must:
- Be fully completed (not interim, not incomplete)
- Feature genuinely new, unpublished, and practice-relevant data
- Pass competitive peer review by an *independent scientific committee* (not just a company pitch)
- Have a high probability of changing clinical practice, informing new guidelines, or materially advancing the field

Historically, the **majority of LBA slots go to large, pivotal Phase 3 trials from major academic consortia or big pharma ‚Äì and overwhelmingly, they are for positive or highly significant findings**. For a smaller company like aTyr to be featured here is itself, in my view, a signal that the data passed an unusually high bar for impact, novelty, and credibility.

**Efzofitimod‚Äôs listing:**
- **Session:** ALERT 3 ‚Äì ‚ÄúInterstitial lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension: late breaking abstracts‚Äù
- **Date:** Tuesday, 30 September 2025
- **Time:** 08:44am CEST
- **Lead Presenter:** Dr. Daniel Culver, Cleveland Clinic ‚Äì a global leader in sarcoidosis/ILD, with a reputation for scientific independence
- **Peer Group:** Sharing the stage with the year‚Äôs headline IPF and PAH trials, not in a poster, not in a satellite ‚Äì this is the main event
- **Official Program Link:** [ERS 2025 Programme ‚Äì ALERT 3 Session](https://k4.ersnet.org/prod/v2/Front/Program?e=685)

**Why does this matter?**  
If this trial had ‚Äúfailed‚Äù in the conventional sense (i.e., clean negative, nothing actionable, or an embarrassing safety signal), the likelihood of it being selected for an ERS late-breaking main session is, in my assessment, *vanishingly small*. This is not a venue for academic curiosity or incremental results ‚Äì it‚Äôs for data that‚Äôs expected to be practice-changing, debated by world leaders, and often rapidly integrated into guidelines.

**Institutional analysts and clinicians know this.** When you see a late-breaking slot at ERS with a top KOL presenting, you are seeing a dataset that passed the most competitive, peer-driven screen for significance, newsworthiness, and likely positive clinical impact in respiratory medicine. This does not guarantee an earth-shattering result, but my read is that it is as strong a public pre-readout tell as you‚Äôll ever get.

**Bottom line:**  
You don‚Äôt get this slot by accident. You get it because you‚Äôve got data that the field‚Äôs leaders ‚Äì not just the company ‚Äì believe will matter.

---

**Why This Is a Major Signal**

Let‚Äôs put this into context for where we are in the timeline. Right now, we‚Äôre in the critical window just before the efzofitimod Phase 3 readout. Data cleaning and statistical work are likely wrapping up, but the full dataset may not yet be officially unblinded. That‚Äôs exactly the point at which an ERS LBA slot acts as a public tell: you don‚Äôt secure this kind of stage without strong, advance conviction in the quality and impact of your results.

ERS Late-Breaking Abstract (LBA) slots are widely recognised by institutional investors and clinicians as the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù for the unveiling of new, practice-changing clinical results in respiratory medicine. Unlike most conference presentations or posters, which can cover everything from exploratory subgroups to small, incremental findings, the LBA session is strictly reserved for the biggest, most newsworthy datasets. This is where the world‚Äôs leading KOLs expect to see real clinical advances - data that will be debated, scrutinised, and, if compelling, rapidly incorporated into practice guidelines and commercial strategy.

This is not just another conference talk. The ALERT session is the **prime-time showcase** of the ERS annual meeting, with top trials lined up back-to-back. There‚Äôs a reason that late-breaker slots are overwhelmingly populated by positive Phase 3 data, high-impact registrational studies, or ‚Äúlandmark‚Äù negative results that change the direction of the field (and even those are typically from big pharma, not microcaps).

In my view, the bar for ‚Äúroutine‚Äù or ‚Äújust interesting‚Äù results is simply not high enough for a slot like this. The ERS scientific committee does not risk its reputation by featuring ambiguous, disappointing, or merely exploratory data as late-breakers - especially not from a smaller company without deep relationships in the field.

For efzofitimod to secure this spot, with a world-class KOL as presenter and placement among the most anticipated trials of the year, signals to the market and medical community that the results are expected to be both new and practice-changing.

In short: if you‚Äôre looking for a public, objective sign of confidence ahead of readout, this is about as strong as it gets.

- - -

**To break this down further:**

- **ERS LBA slots are rarely, if ever, awarded to inconclusive or negative results in this setting** - it‚Äôs a competitive process, and companies typically only apply if they know they have something substantive to show.
- **Peer review and selection is rigorous** - abstracts are reviewed by an independent committee of leading researchers and clinicians, not by the company or its PR team.
- **Main-stage late-breaker presentations are expected to change clinical thinking** - and are followed by Q&A with top KOLs who do not pull punches.
- **For a micro/small-cap like aTyr to land this slot among big pharma programs speaks volumes** about both the perceived importance of the data and the strength of the underlying science.
- **It‚Äôs not just another routine update - it‚Äôs a signal to the entire field that something new and important is about to be revealed.**

- - -

**My Interpretation: What the ERS LBA Slot Actually Signals**

When I look at this through the lens that any serious institution or technical investor would use, there‚Äôs a clear set of signals to decode. The Late-Breaking Abstract (LBA) slot at ERS isn‚Äôt a formality or a PR stunt - it‚Äôs a stamp that says, ‚Äúthis is a study worth paying attention to.‚Äù For a small-cap, orphan-disease trial, that‚Äôs not something handed out lightly.

Let‚Äôs break out the possible scenarios and how I now weigh them, given what we know:

**Possible Scenarios and Confidence Levels**

- **Clinically meaningful win:**  
  The data show a clear, positive result on the primary endpoint (and probably on key secondary endpoints too), with a safety profile that stands up to scrutiny. This is the classic ‚Äúfield-moving‚Äù win.  
  *My confidence: Jumps to 90%+ with the LBA slot and KOL presentation.*

- **Modest or mixed, but positive:**  
  The trial meets the primary endpoint, but maybe the effect size is modest, or there‚Äôs more to debate about subgroups. Still positive, but open to some interpretation.  
  *My confidence: Drops to ~7‚Äì8%.*

- **‚ÄúInteresting fail‚Äù (rare):**  
  Occasionally, a study gets in because a negative result is so novel or surprising that it changes thinking in the field. These are almost always from Big Pharma or blockbuster indications, not microcaps like this.  
  *My confidence: ~2%.*

- **Plain negative/null:**  
  Trial fails, or the data are simply uninformative. For aTyr and this program, with this slot?  
  *My confidence: Essentially nil (<1%).*

**Confidence Table**

| Scenario                      | My Confidence Post-ERS LBA |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Clinically meaningful win      | 90%+                       |
| Modest/mixed but positive      | ~7‚Äì8%                      |
| ‚ÄúInteresting fail‚Äù (rare)      | ~2%                        |
| Plain negative/null            | <1%                        |

A couple of quick precedents: In the last decade, almost every small- and micro-cap respiratory trial given an ERS LBA slot delivered at least a meaningful result - not always a ‚Äúslam dunk,‚Äù but never a flat-out embarrassment. That‚Äôs a standard this process defends.

To my mind, and the way I‚Äôd expect institutions to be reading this, there‚Äôs no real room for a disaster here. The main question is just how strong a win it is, and whether there‚Äôs anything ‚Äúnuanced‚Äù to the result.

If you want an unfiltered take: this is one of the clearest positive pre-readout signals you‚Äôll ever get in biotech. Institutions, funds, analysts - everyone who does this for a living is watching for exactly these tells before a big binary event. Ignore the noise - this is as close to an institutional ‚Äúgo‚Äù signal as you‚Äôre going to see before the data hits.

---

**Why This Matters for Investors**

In my view, this is the moment where the risk/reward profile for $ATYR takes on a fundamentally different shape. Not only does the LBA slot at ERS all but lock in a catalyst date, it‚Äôs also the kind of institutional tell that separates signal from noise.

Here‚Äôs how I see it impacting investors - both retail and institutional - right now:

- **Shifting the Risk/Reward Equation**  
  With a late-breaker, the odds of a complete miss or ‚Äúdata disaster‚Äù scenario drop dramatically. While it‚Äôs never a sure thing, I think the distribution of likely outcomes now leans overwhelmingly to the positive. That fundamentally reduces the left-tail risk and tilts the expected value calculation for anyone sizing up their exposure ahead of the catalyst.

- **Why Institutions and Hedge Funds Track These Signals**  
  This isn‚Äôt just about conference bragging rights. Institutional funds and specialist hedge funds actively track late-breaker announcements, main-stage slots, and KOL involvement because these are objective, externally validated signals that the data is ‚Äúreal‚Äù and impactful. In my opinion, this is the kind of signal that gets plugged straight into institutional models for pre-catalyst positioning.

- **Behavioural Finance: What This Means for Positioning**  
  This is where the market reflexivity starts to kick in. When a key binary event gets this level of visibility, with a prime KOL at the helm, it triggers fund managers and even larger retail players to revisit their risk management. In my read, it‚Äôs a direct prompt for those ‚Äúwaiting for a real sign‚Äù to move off the sidelines - or at least to cover their short-term bets.

- **A Tell of Company and KOL Conviction**  
  KOLs like Dr Culver don‚Äôt stake their reputation on ambiguous or disappointing data, and companies don‚Äôt walk into a late-breaker session unless they believe the data can stand up to real-time scrutiny. I view this as a powerful ‚Äútell‚Äù - a form of public conviction that‚Äôs as close to a vote of confidence as you‚Äôll see before the actual data.

- **Not a Guarantee, But as Strong as Pre-Readout Gets**  
  Of course, it‚Äôs not a guarantee of success. But if you‚Äôre trying to read institutional tea leaves, this is just about as good as it gets before a major catalyst. It‚Äôs a moment to re-examine your thesis, your sizing, and your risk appetite - because the real institutional players are certainly paying attention.

---

**Addressing Remaining Risks and Uncertainties**

Even with all the positives, I always want to keep a skeptical lens up - especially when the stakes are this high. Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôm thinking about what could still go wrong, and why the risk profile looks the way it does right now:

- **Is There Any Chance of Spin or Surprise?**  
  In my view, it‚Äôs not impossible. There are rare cases where companies try to ‚Äúput lipstick on a pig,‚Äù but those typically don‚Äôt make it to late-breaking oral sessions at the world‚Äôs biggest congresses. The reputational cost to both the company and KOL is just too high. While ‚Äúspin‚Äù can happen in poster presentations or minor sessions, it‚Äôs vanishingly rare to see a nothingburger positioned as a late-breaker at ERS - especially from a smaller company without a deep product pipeline.

- **Could a ‚ÄòGood Not Great‚Äô Readout Be Put Up as a Late-Breaker?**  
  It‚Äôs possible, but highly unlikely unless there‚Äôs something genuinely new or practice-changing. The selection committee at ERS is known for curating these slots only for trials that have a clear impact on patient care, or for landmark failures in huge studies that settle a major question. For a program like efzofitimod, ‚Äújust OK‚Äù data isn‚Äôt typically enough to get this stage.

- **Risks of Last-Minute Surprises During Data Cleaning**  
  In any clinical trial, there‚Äôs always a theoretical risk of a data reconciliation or a late adverse event cropping up. The data cleaning and database lock (DB lock) window is where the numbers get triple-checked and queries resolved. But by this stage, most of the major signals are already clear to the sponsor and KOLs - especially if something had gone seriously wrong, it would usually be obvious well before now. The chance of a true ‚Äúblack swan‚Äù at this stage is not zero, but it‚Äôs very low.

- **Timeline and How Confidence Builds**  
  Here‚Äôs the typical sequence:
    - **Data Cleaning:** After last patient visit (July 22), the team works through any outstanding data queries, adverse event reviews, and protocol deviations.  
    - **Database Lock:** Once everything checks out, the database is locked (estimated August 12‚Äì19), meaning no further edits.  
    - **Statistical Analysis & Abstract Submission:** Topline stats can be run in a matter of days, and for a late-breaker, a provisional abstract is often submitted with a promise of full data by the congress.  
    - **Why the KOLs/Company Know Enough Now:** By the time they commit to a late-breaker slot and KOL, they almost always have a clear (if unofficial) read on the overall outcome - safety, signal strength, and potential pitfalls. That‚Äôs why this kind of slot is such a strong tell in my opinion.

- **What Could Go Wrong, and How Often?**  
  The biggest real risk is a ‚Äútechnical fail‚Äù - e.g., the effect is there but not statistically robust, or there‚Äôs a weird safety signal that didn‚Äôt show up until the very end. While these things happen, they are rare at this stage - especially for a main-stage late-breaker at a global congress.

To sum up: While nothing is 100% in biotech, the structure and competitive bar for ERS late-breakers means the remaining risk - at least for a disastrous or embarrassing outcome - is likely to be about as low as it gets at this stage in the process.

**Net Institutional Read and Scenario Summary**

The way I approach setting these probabilities is pretty straightforward ‚Äì and very much my own method. I take into account not just the headline news, but the entire context: the track record of ERS late-breaker slots, the process behind their selection, the behaviour of the sponsor and KOLs, and how these events have historically played out in biotech. I weigh these institutional signals, check them against public precedent, and then layer in the specifics of the current setup for efzofitimod.

Here‚Äôs where I land based on all the objective information at hand, and I want to be crystal clear: **this is just my analysis and opinion, not investment advice.** Please use your own judgment, and seek independent advice if you need it.

| **Scenario**                     | **Probability (my view)** | **Quick Take**                                                                                               |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Clean, Clinically Meaningful Win | 85-90%                   | ERS late-breaker, high-profile KOL, and timing all point toward a positive, field-moving result.            |
| Mixed/‚ÄúGood Not Great‚Äù Result    | 8-13%                    | Possible that primary is met but not all secondary endpoints or effect size is more modest, but still impactful.      |
| Flat Fail/Negative Outcome       | <2%                      | Exceptionally unlikely for an orphan/small-cap program to get this stage if there‚Äôs no real clinical signal. |

**Why am I more confident now than before this news?**  
I was already leaning high-conviction bullish here, based on (a) the pivotal trial design and regulatory alignment, (b) the scientific validation of the HARSWHEP-NRP2 pathway, (c) the insider accumulation and fund flows, and (d) the setup of global KOL involvement throughout the trial. This ERS late-breaker slot adds another crucial piece:  
- It‚Äôs a peer-reviewed, externally curated endorsement that the data are both new and important.
- The selection process is out of the company‚Äôs hands, run by an independent scientific committee, and the session is designed for game-changing results, not ‚Äújust interesting‚Äù or routine outcomes.
- The reputational risk for Dr. Culver and the aTyr team presenting ‚Äúbad‚Äù or disappointing data in this forum is simply too high for this to be a casual or opportunistic move. In my view, they would not be here unless they had substantial reason to expect the data are solid.

So, while I was already confident, this development shifts my probability for a strong, field-moving outcome to the highest end of the range I‚Äôve ever held for a binary catalyst like this.

To reiterate: **this is not a guarantee, and not a recommendation to buy or sell ‚Äì it‚Äôs just my interpretation of the setup based on all available evidence.**  
Biotech always carries risk, and no matter how compelling the signals, every investor needs to do their own work, challenge these assumptions, and make sure their position matches their own risk tolerance. My hope is that by laying out the reasoning in detail, it helps you see how I‚Äôm connecting the dots and why this specific signal matters so much ‚Äì but ultimately, you should draw your own conclusions, seek advice if needed, and position accordingly.

**Summary and Final Thoughts**

Let‚Äôs be absolutely clear: The inclusion of efzofitimod as a late-breaking abstract in a prime-time ALERT slot at the 2025 ERS Congress is not just a routine conference update - it‚Äôs one of the most significant signals we could possibly get ahead of readout. In my opinion, you do not see this level of main-stage scientific attention unless the data is truly expected to move the field. This is about as close to an institutional ‚Äútell‚Äù as you‚Äôll ever get pre-readout, and it should not be underestimated.

If you‚Äôre a retail investor trying to make sense of all the noise, volatility, and short-driven drama, this is the time to step back, breathe, and focus on the real signals. Yes, there‚Äôs always uncertainty in biotech - that‚Äôs the nature of the game. But I believe moments like this are when you need to lean into objective, evidence-driven analysis and resist the urge to react emotionally to every headline.

Part of what we do here, and why I keep coming back, is to read between the lines - to cut through the fog and highlight the signals that actually matter. In my view, it‚Äôs not about being ‚Äúall in‚Äù or betting the farm. It‚Äôs about understanding where the genuine probabilities lie, and making decisions based on a synthesis of the best evidence, timing, and market structure available. That‚Äôs what I try to bring to this community, and I hope you find it as useful as I do.

1mfv3te,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIpoweredInfluencer/comments/1mfv3te/i_just_made_100_from_my_couch_in_5_daysall_by/,I Just Made $100 From My Couch in 5 Days‚ÄîALL By Downloading Random Apps?! Someone Explain Because My Jaw Is STILL On The Floor!,"Umm‚Ä¶guys, WHAT just happened? Because I swear I‚Äôm still lowkey SHOCKED at how I just made a crisp $100‚Ä¶not joking‚Ä¶*from my phone, in a WEEK*, all by just testing random apps. Like, is this even real life?

Okay, so here's how it went down:

- I‚Äôve always doubted those ‚Äúmake money from your phone‚Äù things. They sound fake, right? But I was bored, and honestly, why NOT try at least once? (Don‚Äôt roast me, lol.)
- Ended up on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and almost laughed, but curiosity got me.
- You register, you get a list of apps, you test. THAT‚ÄôS IT. Some days it‚Äôs puzzle games, sometimes shopping apps‚Ä¶it‚Äôs weird, but somehow just‚Ä¶fun?
- Each app gives you a little task, and you get paid for just giving your honest feedback.

I know it sounds like one of those internet fairy tales, but y‚Äôall‚ÄîREAL screenshots, real PayPal ping, real $100. (Yes, I triple-checked if it was a scam. I can‚Äôt even count the times my Spidey senses were tingling, but all they wanted was my review after trying an app, no weird info.)

What shook me the most?

- Some apps are literally fun, so I was vibing AND getting paid.
- There‚Äôs no big catch. No deposit, no ‚Äúupgrade to get your payout‚Äù scam. Just download apps, test them, get your $.
- Minimum payout is LOW, so you see your money after just a few tries.

But here‚Äôs the kicker:

I nearly fell off my couch when, after 5 days, my total tipped OVER $95. Like‚Ä¶HOLD UP. Mom‚Äôs side hustle stories never prepped me for THAT. By Sunday night? $100+ just sitting in my PayPal, winking at me.

And yes, I used **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** the whole time, swapping different apps, racking up rewards.  
Learned a few things along the way:

- The sooner you sign up at **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**, the more variety you get. Early bird = better apps.
- Your reviews actually matter‚Äîthey‚Äôll pay more for quality feedback, not just random words.
- If you‚Äôre consistent (think 20-30 minutes a night), it adds up shockingly fast. Like, I barely noticed the grind.

Is this gonna pay your rent? Heck no. But for buying coffee, pizza, or that game you‚Äôve been eyeing? GO FOR IT.

Still confused. Still hyped. Still staring at screenshots like ‚Äúno way did that just work‚Ä¶‚Äù

So that‚Äôs my plot twist week:  
Phone. Pajamas. Couch.  
100 bucks from **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and a renewed sense that maybe, occasionally, the internet *isn‚Äôt* out to get you.

Has anyone ELSE tried **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** like this? Am I late to the party or what?

I am a 23 year old woman who has never been in a relationship. Now you could say:  
\-Maybe you are just shy?  
\-Maybe you are at home all day and shut yourself off?  
But no- not at all. In fact I am very good at socializing, not in a party alcohol type of way but in a 'let's chill at the park or go to a coffee or chill at home' type of way.

I have lots of guy friends. Some of them are super popular, some of them are normal and some of them are very introverted- just all types of guys.  They come to me to ask for advice, they want my opinion on certain things, or we just find topics we find fascinating and talk about it for hours sometimes.

Like one of my favorite things to do is to grab a coffee, go to the park and just chill and it's always fun (I don't only do that with guys, I also do this with female friends, it's just genuinely something I enjoy.)

Here is the thing: I often approach guys I am interested in but it always ends up in a friendship like that.

I've been told by several guys things like:

""You are the most interesting person I have ever met!""

""Nobody has ever taught me more than you!""

""You are the best person to talk to!""

""I love your worldview!""

All of these are nice compliments but they never lead to anything. I always hope : 'Pleaseeeeee just ask me out!'

But does it happen? No.

The argument: 'They are just shy' isn't valid because I have overheard them talking to their mates about being ghosted by a girl they are interested in and often they also ask me for advice about their crushes.

I am always like: What do these girls have that I don't have???

Sure I am not the prettiest of the bunch but my 18 year old sister is GORGEOUS STUNNING, and often we get mistaken as twins which I don't understand why because we don't look alike, but surely this has to mean that I am not that bad.

Just what am I doing wrong? Why will I never get¬†someone to look at me and be like "" I want to be with her!"" ??? what am I doing wrong??

**Why This Pick?** 

As I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve stated a few times over the last two weeks now, I‚Äôve given up on the Diamondbacks offense, friends. In addition, Arizona starter Zac Gallen (5.60 ERA) has allowed a staggering 16 runs in just his last 3 outings. If you‚Äôre looking to make a comparison (and you should be‚Ä¶), Athletics starter J.T. Ginn (3.89 ERA) has allowed a mere 2 runs over his last 3 starts. Having won 7 of their last 8 games, my money‚Äôs on the home team to bag another win over their opponent here.

Daily scale checks are great for some people, but they can be downright unhealthy for others, causing stress, anxiety, depression, and even fear. Daily scale results have caused many to give up and quit before they've even started. In keeping with the journey metaphor, our scale is our friend, but they aren't the friend that travels with us daily on our quest. Those items are our fitness trackers, and our food records (apps, journals, ets...). Our scale is the friend we sent ahead, who we meet up with once or twice a week for a coffee date, to chat with about any significant  changes or challenges we will be facing in the days till our next meeting. Like all friends, if they are good ones, there will be good news, and there will be bad news, but the information they give us will guide us in what is working, and what we will need to work on to get better results. We take it's information, and the information from our other journey companions and use that to calculate how we should proceed for the results we want.
If daily scale checks work for you, and motivate you, I have a great admiration for you. If they are stressing you out, discouraging you, or at the worst, making you think of quitting, focus daily on your fitness and diet records, watch those to see how you can improve, or what is working right for you, and I look forward to your weekly scale checks, I can't wait to see all of our successes, and how we can create more.üí•üåª",3,1754152312.0,UNSUBSCRIBEpodcast,2,0.8,False

# Factors Influencing Popularity

Starbucks is a household name in the coffee world. But what makes certain coffees more popular than others? Several factors play a role in a coffee‚Äôs popularity. These include flavor profiles, seasonal trends, and marketing strategies. Let‚Äôs dive deeper into each factor.

# Flavor Profiles

Flavor is a key factor in coffee popularity. Starbucks offers a wide range of flavor options. Some coffees are rich and bold. Others are smooth and creamy. The variety caters to different taste preferences. For example, the Pike Place Roast is a favorite for its balanced flavor. On the other hand, the Caramel Macchiato attracts those who love sweet, indulgent drinks. Understanding flavor profiles helps explain why certain coffees stand out.

# Seasonal Trends

Seasonal trends greatly influence coffee choices. Starbucks introduces seasonal drinks to match different times of the year. The Pumpkin Spice Latte is a classic fall favorite. Its popularity peaks as the leaves start to change. During the winter, the Peppermint Mocha warms up cold days. These seasonal offerings create excitement. Customers eagerly await their return each year.

# Marketing Strategies

Marketing strategies also drive coffee popularity. Starbucks uses creative campaigns to promote new and existing drinks. Eye-catching advertisements grab attention both online and offline. Social media plays a big role in spreading the word. Limited-time offers and special promotions create urgency. These strategies make certain coffees more desirable to customers. Starbucks leverages its brand power to keep drinks in the spotlight.

# Regional Variations

Different regions prefer different coffee flavors. In colder areas, people lean towards warm, rich coffees. Places with warmer climates often favor iced coffees. This variation impacts Starbucks‚Äô menu choices across the globe.

Age influences coffee preferences significantly. Younger customers often prefer sweetened, blended beverages. Older patrons might choose classic brews. Starbucks adapts its offerings to cater to all age groups.

Lifestyle choices affect coffee selection. Busy professionals might opt for quick espresso shots. Health-conscious individuals prefer non-dairy, low-sugar options. Starbucks provides choices that fit various lifestyles.

1mfurzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1mfurzy/why_choose_apec_water_filter_set_es_review_for/,Why Choose APEC Water Filter Set ES Review for Your Home?,"Testing out the APEC WATER FILTER-SET-ES for the APEC Essence Series has been a game changer in my daily water filtration routine. This replacement pre-filter set is packed with features designed to enhance water quality for reverse osmosis systems, and I‚Äôve spent time dissecting its performance as if I lived in a lab. Admittedly, I wasn‚Äôt sold right away, but over time, I began to appreciate just how much this set offers, though I did find a few quirks along the way.

**Design and Build Quality**

Right off the bat, the design of these filters feels premium and functional. The compact dimensions‚Äî2.5"" x 7.5"" x 10""‚Äîmake them an easy fit under most sinks without cramping your plumbing setup. Made from polypropylene and carbon, they feel robust and well-engineered, offering a smooth installation process. Even with my subpar DIY skills, replacing the filters took roughly ten minutes, and I didn‚Äôt need to consult the instruction manual beyond a casual glance. However, while the white filter casings do look clean and minimalistic, they‚Äôre prone to catching smudges, which could be annoying if aesthetics matter to you.

**Performance and Efficiency**

Testing this product daily, I noticed a consistent improvement in my home‚Äôs water quality. The first stage in this set‚Äîa 5-micron sediment filter‚Äîis a beast at capturing dust, rust, and dirt, which is a huge relief considering our older plumbing system. Stages two and three, featuring 10-micron extruded carbon block filters, tackle chlorine, odd odors, and unpleasant tastes. My coffee tasted better, and my kids even commented on how refreshing cold water felt straight from the tap. If reducing VOCs and purifying water quality sits high on your priority list, this system delivers beyond expectations. Still, for extremely high-contaminant areas, an additional filtration step might be needed, which the basic set won‚Äôt cover.

**Check [APEC WATER FILTER-SET-ES price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b00i11hugw/)**

**Ease of Compatibility**

These filters are specially tailored for APEC Water System models like the ROES-50, ROES-UV75, and ROES-PH75‚Äîmodels that see wide usage. What‚Äôs impressive is that they‚Äôre also compatible with all standard-sized under-sink reverse osmosis (RO) systems, so you‚Äôre not boxed into one specific setup. This cross-compatibility is golden if you‚Äôve got an existing RO system from another brand but don‚Äôt want the headache of hunting down spare filters for every service. However, be aware that while it aligns with ‚Äústandard-sized‚Äù systems, off-brand irregular-sized systems could pose challenges.

**Key Benefits**

- Removes dust, dirt, and rust with a powerful sediment filter.  
- Effectively reduces chlorine taste and odor for better-tasting water.  
- Compatible with a variety of standard under-sink reverse osmosis setups.  

**Caveats**

- White casing picks up smudges rather easily during handling.  
- Might not be sufficient alone for extremely high water contaminant levels.  
- Some users report pressure drops in unusual RO configurations.  

**Filter Lifespan and Practicality**

On average, these filters last around six months, though this varies depending on how much water you consume and how hard your water is. With a family of four who loves their filtered water, I was right on schedule for a replacement after 5.5 months. Also, the replacement cost feels reasonable when you consider the benefits of prolonging the life of your entire filtration unit. Constant filter changes may annoy some, but for me, it‚Äôs a small price to pay for peace of mind.

**Industry Competitors**

Comparing the APEC filter set with brands like iSpring and Express Water reveals some contrasts. A notable competitor like the iSpring RCC7 offers comparable filtration, but APEC‚Äôs sediment filter seems more effective at handling rust in older houses. Express Water, while innovative in offering UV features at certain price points, doesn‚Äôt quite match the build quality or sediment filtration focus of this set. If customization is your thing, Express Water may appeal to you, but if simplicity and reliability win your heart, APEC doesn‚Äôt disappoint.

**Bang for the Buck**

In terms of price-to-quality ratio, I‚Äôve found this product incredibly satisfying. You‚Äôre not just buying a set of random filters; you‚Äôre investing in a system that protects your main RO unit for a modest cost. Unlike lower-tier options littering the market, these filters legitimately do what they claim, saving you from unnecessary future repair expenses. Other solutions may save a few dollars upfront but often require frequent filter replacements or risk filter clogs that harm your system.

Uska haath meri kamar par tha, aur hum ek dusre se aise chipke hue the jaise raat bhar ki garmahat abhi bhi hamare jism mein basi ho. Uski khushboo, uski presence, sab kuch mujhe ghere hue thi. Main dheere se uthi, uski taraf dekha, aur mere chehre par ek pyari si smile aa gayi. Woh kitna handsome lag raha tha soote hue, uske chehre par ek masoomiyat thi jo raat ki wildness se bilkul alag thi! ü§§

Thodi der baad, Martin ki bhi aankh khuli. Usne meri taraf dekha aur ek pyari si smile di, uski aankhon mein woh chamak thi jo keh rahi thi ki yeh raat kitni special thi, aur usmein kitni gehri yaadein chhupi hain. Ham logon ke beech mein bas smiles mein hi baat ho rahi thi, aankhon hi aankhon mein hum sab kuch keh rahe the, bina kisi shabd ke. Woh utha aur mere liye coffee banayi, yaar, itna pyara gesture! ‚òïÔ∏è Usne mujhe coffee ka cup diya aur bed par mere paas baith gaya, uske touch se mere andar ek halki si current daud gayi. ""Sheetal,"" usne dheere se kaha, uski awaaz mein ek ajeeb si request thi, ""Can I live in your room only? I don't want to go back to my room."" Mera dil toh pehle hi uske paas tha, aur uski yeh baat sunkar main aur bhi pighal gayi. ""Martin,"" maine smile karte hue kaha, meri awaaz mein ek softness thi, ""Of course. You can stay."" Uske chehre par ek badi si smile aa gayi, aur usne mera haath pakad kar ek soft kiss kiya, jaise woh mere haath mein apni puri duniya rakh raha ho. üíñ

Us din hum dono ne Ubud ke markets explore kiye, local food try kiya, aur bas ek dusre ki company enjoy ki. Har pal uske saath ek naya adventure lag raha tha, aur uski presence se meri life mein ek alag hi rang bhar gaya tha. Humari baatein ab aur gehri ho gayi thi, hum ek dusre ke sapne, fears, aur desires share kar rahe the, jaise hum ek dusre ko saalon se jaante hon. Ekdam aisa feel tha ki ham dono ek dusre ko kitne saalon se jaante hain, jaise hum soulmates hon jo Bali mein mile hon, aur yeh connection din-b-din aur bhi gehra hota ja raha tha. üåà

Next day morning mein, ham log usi beach par, usi island par jaane ka plan kiye, jahan humne pehli baar kiss kiya tha. üåÖ Woh kafi intimate aur secluded island tha, jahan tak pahunchna thoda mushkil tha, isliye wahan koi nahi aata tha. Fortunately, us din wahan koi nahi tha, ekdum khaali. Jaise hi hum wahan pahunche, subah ki thandi hawa aur samundar ki shaant awaaz ne humein gher liya. Suraj abhi nikal hi raha tha, aur aasmaan mein orange aur pink shades fail rahe the, ekdum romantic atmosphere tha. Hum dono haath pakad kar us island par chal rahe the, aur woh memories phir se taazi ho rahi thi, har kadam ke saath ek naya ehsaas. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

Slowly, things became heated again. Martin ne meri taraf dekha, uski aankhon mein woh aag thi jo raat bhar se mere andar jal rahi thi. Usne dheere se mera haath pakda aur mujhe ek bade ped ki taraf le gaya, jo thoda chhupa hua tha, jahan humein koi dekh nahi sakta tha. ""Sheetal,"" usne dheere se kaha, uski awaaz mein ek raw desire thi, ""I want you. Right here."" Meri saansein tez ho gayi, aur mere jism mein ek shiver daud gayi, jaise uski har chahat mujhe apni taraf khinch rahi ho. Usne mera skirt dheere se neeche pull kiya, aur woh mere ghutno tak aa gaya, meri thighs ab puri tarah se exposed thi. Meri panties ab bhi thi, par uski nazrein meri thighs par thi, jaise woh unhein apni aankhon se choom raha ho. Maine uski aankhon mein dekha, aur uski chahat ko mehsoos kiya, mere andar ki aag aur bhi badh gayi. Main us ped ke taney se tek laga kar khadi ho gayi, meri back us par thi, aur meri hips thodi bahar nikli hui thi, ek perfect angle banate hue. Usne meri panties ko ek jhatke mein neeche khincha, aur woh meri ankles par latak gayi. Uska penis ab mere entrance par tha, garam aur hard, uski hardness meri skin par feel ho rahi thi. Usne mujhe ped se dabaya, aur ek tez thrust ke saath, woh mere andar ghus gaya. ü•µ ""Aah!"" mere muh se ek halki si cheekh nikli, par woh pure pleasure ki thi, ek aisi cheekh jo us pal ki intensity ko bayaan kar rahi thi. Usne mujhe us ped se dabaye rakha, aur zor-zor se fuck karna shuru kiya. Meri hips us ped se takra rahi thi, aur har thrust ke saath, main aur gehrai mein doobti ja rahi thi, uski har movement mujhe aur bhi madhosh kar rahi thi. Uski saansein mere kaanon mein garam lag rahi thi, aur uske haath meri kamar par the, mujhe aur kareeb khinch rahe the, jaise woh mujhe apni puri tarah se apne andar sama lena chahta ho. Yeh position itni raw aur wild thi, mujhe bohot maza aa raha tha, ek ajeeb sa thrill tha us pal mein. ü§§

Uske baad usne mujhe dheere se zameen par kiya. Wahan ki ret thodi thandi thi, par uski garmahat ne mujhe gher liya, aur hum dono ret par ek dusre mein kho gaye. Usne mujhe doggy position mein le aaya. Main ab haathon aur ghutno par thi, meri hips upar uthi hui thi, aur mera face rising sun ki taraf tha. Meri aankhein band thi, par suraj ki halki garmahat meri peeth par feel ho rahi thi, aur uski har thrust ke saath, main aur bhi gehrai mein doobti ja rahi thi. Uska penis mere andar itna deep ja raha tha ki mujhe laga woh meri rooh tak ko chhoo raha ho, har nerve ko activate karte hue. Main bas uski har thrust ko mehsoos kar rahi thi, uski body ka har movement meri body mein utar raha tha. Usne apne dono haathon se meri gol hips ko kas kar pakad liya, unhein apne penis ke around dabate hue. Uski ungliyan meri hips par gad rahi thi, aur uski pakad itni mazboot thi ki main uski har thrust ke saath aur bhi tight feel kar rahi thi. He was pounding me hard from behind. Har thrust itni powerful thi ki mera jism aage ki taraf dhakel raha tha, aur meri hips uske penis par ek alag hi pressure bana rahi thi, jaise woh mere andar puri tarah se sama jaana chahta ho. Meri saansein tez thi, aur mere muh se bas ""aah... aah... Martin!"" ki awaazein nikal rahi thi, jo hawa mein ghul rahi thi. Uski skin meri skin se takra rahi thi, aur uski har movement se ek ajeeb si friction aur garmahat feel ho rahi thi. Usne mere baalon ko pakda aur unhein halka sa khincha, uski dominant touch mujhe aur bhi madhosh kar rahi thi, ek ajeeb sa dard aur pleasure ka mix. 

""Sheetal,"" usne dheere se mere kaan mein fusfusaya, uski awaaz mein ek gehri, raw chahat thi, ""You are so beautiful. So wild. I love how you move for me."" Uske words ne mere andar ki aag ko aur bhadka diya, aur main bas uski har thrust par respond kar rahi thi, uski puri energy ko apne andar mehsoos karte hue. Har thrust ke saath, woh apni hatheliyon se meri hips par zor se thappad maar raha tha, ek loud thwack ki awaaz aati thi. Uski har clap meri hips par ek alag hi sensation de rahi thi, aur woh awaaz samundar ki laharon ki awaaz mein ghul rahi thi. Meri moans, jo pehle toh loud thi, ab samundar ki shor mein ekdum silent ho gayi thi, jaise woh bhi us natural symphony ka part ban gayi hon. üåä Uski har clap aur meri har moan us beach ki hawa mein mix ho rahi thi, ek ajeeb sa erotic atmosphere bana rahi thi.

Vo fuck karte karte suddenly bahar nikala. Meri body ek pal ke liye hawa mein ruk si gayi, aur phir dheere se neeche aayi. Uska penis mere entrance se bahar aaya, aur uski garam, thick ejaculate itni zor se fly ki ki mere balon mein gira. üí¶ Kuch drops mere gaalon par bhi mehsoos hue, aur unki garmahat ne mujhe ek ajeeb sa shock diya. Meri aankhein khul gayi, aur maine uski taraf dekha. Uske chehre par ek gehri satisfaction thi, aur uski saansein tez thi. Main puri tarah se thak chuki thi, meri muscles mein halka dard tha, par yeh dard bhi ek alag hi pleasure de raha tha. I was completely finished off, ekdum dheeli pad gayi thi. Ham dono bas vahin ek dusre ki baahon mein baith gaye, ret par, suraj ki pehli kirnein hamare jism par pad rahi thi. Yaar, itna zyada penetrated and pleasured kabhi feel nahi kiya tha maine. Meri body ab bhi shiver kar rahi thi, aur mere andar ek ajeeb si shanti thi, jaise ek toofan ke baad ki shaanti. üòå

Next almost 8-9 days mujhe vahin rehna tha, aur main aur Martin pura time sath mein hi rahe the. Har din ek naya adventure tha, naye experiences, aur ek dusre ke saath aur bhi gehra connection. Kabhi hum beaches par ghumte, kabhi waterfalls par jaate, aur kabhi bas room mein ek dusre ki company enjoy karte. Ekdam aisa feel tha ki ham dono ek dusre ko kitne saalon se jaante hain, jaise hum soulmates hon jo Bali mein mile hon. üíñ Har din uske saath aur bhi special lagne laga tha, aur main uski har chahat ko pura karna chahti thi. ü§´",1,1754152111.0,SheetalDiaries,0,1.0,False

1mfupkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/maintenance/comments/1mfupkq/british_guy_did_maintenance_in_a_care_home_now/,"British Guy, Did Maintenance in a care home now moving to a high end luxury apartment complex, Questions, Help and Advice for a Brit working in American homes.","As the title suggests, I‚Äôm currently a maintenance tech at a nursing home but just got accepted for a new role at my apartment complex. For context, the complex is on the higher end‚Äîrent is about $2.5k/month for a 2-bedroom, no Section 8 housing, etc.

I‚Äôm wondering how good of a job this is compared to other maintenance positions across the U.S., and I‚Äôd love any tips or advice for working in multi-family housing.

Here‚Äôs a little background: Working at the nursing home was fairly easy‚Äîmostly fixing nursing beds, wheelchairs, plug-in PTAC units, and doing small rewires for over-bed lights. It was a great entry point into maintenance, especially since I moved here from another country.

In that role, I earned $28/hour, was on-call 24/7 (though rarely called), had no matching 401k, mediocre health insurance, and just 1.5 weeks of vacation that didn‚Äôt increase with tenure. Despite all that, it was a fun job‚Äîthe nurses and staff were social and friendly, and the residents loved me because I was the guy fixing everything.

Now, my new role is with the apartment complex, which has around 100 units in close proximity (golf cart distance). The property is relatively new and includes amenities like a pool, gym, social room, and coffee machines for residents. The benefits seem better: 401k matching, up to 10% of my yearly salary as a bonus depending on cost savings, $500 off my rent, 2 weeks of vacation, and improved health plans and a promise of a HVAC and Pool Op License training, At 26 a hour instead of 28. Overall, it feels like a solid step up even at a 2 dollar a hour step down.

That said, I‚Äôve never worked in multi-family housing before, and I know the expectations are higher than in a nursing home. In the nursing home, quick fixes were fine‚Äîyou could patch something up now and properly repair it later‚Äîbut I imagine that approach won‚Äôt fly here.

Also, I‚Äôm British, so my accent tends to make people friendlier toward me, which might help a bit. But I‚Äôd really appreciate advice on what to expect, how to prepare, and what tools I absolutely need for this type of work. Are there any big dos and don‚Äôts I should know about?

If I were starting at your place tomorrow, what advice would you give a new tech? If it were your son or daughter starting out, what words of wisdom would you share to help them make a good impression on supervisors? Do supervisors prefer techs who double-check everything or those who just dive in and get things done? When licenses are achieved, What sort of raise should i be thinking of requesting?

I feel like this could be a great thread for sharing tips and lessons learned in the multi-family maintenance world. Thanks in advance‚ÄîI‚Äôm excited to hear your thoughts!",6,1754151960.0,maintenance,4,1.0,False
1mfupf9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mfupf9,Struggling to lose weight,"Hi,

I have started my journey at 36 years, 115 kg. Went to 108kg during sickness through adjusting diet. In April I started lifting weight. Since then I am up and down with my weight going to 103 at some point, but some weekends when i drink alcohol with friends i reset by two weeks immediately( 3 times so far). I just finished a wellness week with my GF where i didnt count calories and drank two nights and went from 104.3 to 107.2. One photo from today, one from when i was 33 yo and 103kg (only other photo i have unfortunately).

Bought a garmin watch and garmin scale. Watch says that my passive burn is 2500. Scale says my body fat is 28.5 in April and in those 4 months it went up and down to 27.5. Im at 28.5 again according to garmin scale. Did an inbody scan and it says 23.1, but without a prior point of reference, that seems worthless.

Calorie-wise i have a food company that gives me 5 meals a day 5 days a week, ranging from 2050 to 2400 calories. As said watch estimates passive burn at 2500, inbody recommends 2800. I do protein, creatin, karnitin, glutamin and preworkouts. Coffee and protein bars/puddings when i have a sweets craving. I usually dont go over 2800 and when i do its only when i work out. I work out 3-6 days a week ( depending on work) but mostly around 5 (split cardio, upper, lower, rest day).

I seem to have gained muscle a little bit (not really showing in the pictures) but i feel like my fat doesnt go away and feel a bit demotivated. I know the garmin scale is not very accurate, but i hoped to see a trend of going down instead of going back and forth around the same value.

I plan to have a dexa scan and passive calorimetry scan to get a more accurate passive burn estimate, since i assume thats the main reason? What do you guys think? Do i eat too much, or do i overthink it? Is it normally so slow, or am i definitely doing something wrong? Do I have to completely ditch alcohol? 5 nights since April doesnt seem much to me, but maybe it is? Any suggestions, feedback welcome, thank you!",3,1754151948.0,askfitness,6,0.81,False

1mfun7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotColdTruth/comments/1mfun7o/find_out_if_the_best_electric_kettle_from_peach/,Find Out if the Best Electric Kettle from Peach Street Lives Up to the Hype,"The Peach Street PE-1302 Electric Kettle quickly became an indispensable part of my daily routine. As an avid tea drinker who boils water multiple times a day, I‚Äôm always on the lookout for an efficient, reliable, and safe kettle. This product didn‚Äôt disappoint, but it came with a few quirks worth mentioning. Let‚Äôs dive into its features and overall performance, based on my thorough daily use.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the aesthetic appeal of this kettle caught my attention. Made of borosilicate glass and brushed stainless steel, it is both durable and modern-looking. The clear glass exterior, combined with a blue LED light that illuminates during boiling, adds a touch of elegance to my kitchen counter. Frankly, it looks like it belongs in a luxury appliance ad. The wide mouth design made filling the kettle straightforward, and cleaning it was a breeze since there‚Äôs ample space to get your hand inside. The compact dimensions‚Äîjust 7"" by 9""‚Äîmean it doesn‚Äôt hog counter space, which is a plus in my crowded kitchen.

**Performance Highlights**  
The selling point for me was how fast this kettle boils water. Equipped with a 1,500-watt heating element and an OTTER controller, it brought 1.7 liters of water to a boil significantly faster than my previous model. Whether I needed water for a quick cup of coffee or boiling water for pasta, its speed consistently exceeded my expectations. The blue LED light is not just a pretty feature‚Äîit‚Äôs an excellent visual indicator to know the kettle is working without standing next to it.

**Safety Features**  
Safety is where this kettle shines. The auto-shutoff feature ensures that the kettle switches off as soon as the water boils, preventing accidents or dry-boiling. The handle stays completely cool to the touch, offering extra protection during use. There‚Äôs also a concealed heating element, which eliminates concerns about toxins leaking into the water. However, I quickly learned the hard way that pouring with the lid open results in some unpleasant splashing‚Äîthis minor warning is something you‚Äôll want to note.

[Check Peach Street PE-1302 price on Amazon.](https://designmara.com/p/b0b2q7n54s/)

**Ease of Use and Convenience**  
The 360-degree rotating base turned out to be more useful than I initially imagined. This is especially handy when you live with someone who‚Äôs left-handed and needs quick access to the kettle from different angles. Being cordless while off its base made pouring smoother and more convenient than many other kettles I‚Äôve used. Storage is another thoughtful touch. The cord can be neatly coiled and hidden in the base, ensuring my countertop doesn‚Äôt look cluttered.

**Durability and Materials**  
The build quality is outstanding, thanks to its borosilicate glass and stainless-steel components. It feels designed to last without succumbing to discoloration or wear. The glass exterior remains brilliantly clear even after regular use, and having visible measurement markers makes it easier to pour the right amount every time. Based on some past experiences, kettles with lesser materials often developed mineral stains or odors, but this one has been pristine so far.

**Positives**  
‚Ä¢ Rapid boiling with a 1,500-watt heating element  
‚Ä¢ Auto-shutoff and boil-dry protection enhance safety  
‚Ä¢ Elegant and durable borosilicate glass design  
‚Ä¢ Wide mouth for easier cleaning and refilling  
‚Ä¢ 360-degree rotating base and concealed cord storage  

**Areas for Improvement**  
‚Ä¢ Lid splashes slightly when pouring if it‚Äôs left open  
‚Ä¢ The blue LED light doesn‚Äôt always turn off until the base is entirely reset  
‚Ä¢ It could benefit from a quieter boiling process, as it‚Äôs a bit loud  

**Product Alternatives**  
While this kettle is impressive, there are some competitors worth mentioning. The COSORI Electric Kettle, for instance, also features quick heating and a sleek design but lacks the same elegant blue light display. If durability is what you need, the Mueller Austria Stainless Steel Kettle promises enhanced corrosion resistance. However, it doesn‚Äôt come equipped with the same safety-oriented constrained heating element. In situations where budget matters, basic models like the Amazon Basics Electric Kettle might suffice, but they don‚Äôt match the performance or safety features offered by this product.

**Value Proposition**  
Given its combination of speed, safety, and design, this kettle hits a sweet spot for value. It feels like a premium product without the premium price tag. Compared to other options in its class, it delivers exceptional functionality for heating water quickly, safely, and stylishly. The additional safety features‚Äîlike auto-shutoff and stay-cool handle‚Äîmake it a worthwhile investment for families or busy households.

1mfuj9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerInUse/comments/1mfuj9r/should_the_toshiba_em131a5c_microwave_be_your_top/,Should the Toshiba EM131A5C Microwave Be Your Top Kitchen Pick,"Testing the TOSHIBA EM131A5C-BS microwave has been an unexpectedly delightful addition to my daily routine. As someone who relies heavily on kitchen appliances to streamline meal prep, I‚Äôve put this model through its paces over the past few weeks. Whether it was reheating leftovers from last night‚Äôs dinner or defrosting frozen vegetables at the eleventh hour, this microwave had to prove its worth. Spoiler alert: it mostly delivered ‚Äì but not without some quirks along the way.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The sleek black stainless steel exterior is not just visually appealing but also a perfect fit for most modern kitchens. It's compact without feeling cramped, yet spacious enough to fit a full-sized dinner plate or even a 12-inch pizza, thanks to the 1.2 cubic feet capacity and the removable 12.4"" turntable. While I have a soft spot for minimalist aesthetics, the large digital display genuinely surprised me with its clarity. Whether groggy in the morning or rushing after work, I never found myself squinting at the timer or settings. The door handle design is ergonomic and sturdy, so no fiddling with awkward buttons to pop it open ‚Äì just grab and go. 

**Ease of Use**  
Functionality was a significant factor for me, and the intuitive control panel made the transition from my old microwave seamless. The pre-programmed sensor menu is a dream. I've used the pizza reheat setting more times than I'd care to admit, and the even heating is a definite win. Forget stirring cold spots halfway through ‚Äì this microwave handles temperature distribution like a pro. Another standout feature is the mute function. Long-pressing the ""8"" for a few seconds silences the notorious microwave beeping sound, which, as a parent of toddlers, I‚Äôve come to appreciate more than I thought I would. Late-night popcorn sessions no longer risk an unintentional wake-up call!

[Check TOSHIBA EM131A5C-BS price on Amazon.](https://maisea.com/p/b071wcb1t6/)

**Performance and Power**  
With 1000 watts of power, this microwave struck a solid balance between speed and consistency. Whether defrosting a pound of ground beef or reheating my coffee for the umpteenth time, it handled the tasks without faltering. The sensor reheating feature, which optimally cooks popular foods, genuinely works as advertised. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that the power level settings provide limited granularity, and fine-tuning for precise cooking can feel a bit restrictive. Still, it gets 90% of my daily tasks done without a hitch.

**Highlights**  
- Sleek, black stainless steel exterior that suits modern aesthetics.  
- Generous 1.2 cubic feet of space, ideal for larger dishes.  
- Intuitive sensor cooking options, making reheats effortless.  
- Easy-to-read digital display with a countdown timer.  
- Quiet operation with a convenient mute function for no distractions.  

**Drawbacks**  
Not everything about this microwave is perfect. There were some aspects that could use improvement.  
- The protective film on the keypad during shipment left a sticky residue after removal.  
- Settings didn‚Äôt always retain user preferences like power levels after the auto menu ended.  
- The interior light is slightly dimmer than I‚Äôd hoped, leading me to open the door to double-check cooking progress.

**Competing Products**  
In comparison to similarly priced microwaves like the Panasonic NN-SN686S or the BLACK+DECKER EM720CB7, the Toshiba EM131A5C-BS has a clear edge in terms of ease of use and design appeal. While the Panasonic model offers a Smart Inverter for more precise heat control, it‚Äôs bulkier and slightly challenging to maneuver in tighter spaces. BLACK+DECKER, on the other hand, fell short in its sensor cooking capabilities, often leaving food unevenly heated. The Toshiba managed to hit the sweet spot between reliability and modern features, standing out as a user-friendly option for those unwilling to sacrifice performance for stylish design.

**Bang for the Buck**  
In its price category, it‚Äôs safe to say this microwave offers significant value. With its smart sensor features, aesthetic appeal, and generous size, I‚Äôd wager you‚Äôre getting more than what you pay for. While minor tweaks to the settings interface would elevate the experience, these aren‚Äôt deal-breaking flaws. Given the consistency in performance across various tasks, I never felt like I was shortchanging myself by opting for this model. It's an affordable yet modern addition to any kitchen lineup.

1mfuiyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/toxicparents/comments/1mfuiyz/an_opinion_about_my_mother/,An opinion about my mother?,"I (F29) have difficulties in my relationship with my mother. I sometimes find her controlling and patronizing. I don't see her very often, but whatever I give her never seems to be enough or appreciated‚Äîin fact, it's often the opposite. Until now, I've always tried to keep her at a distance by using sarcasm. I think it was a disguised way of protecting myself.

Like every summer, I went on vacation with friends to the family home. Recently, my parents moved to the neighboring town. My father went on a two-month trip, so my mother is alone. I know she doesn't handle loneliness well. She invited me to have coffee one afternoon to see my grandparents, who were visiting her. Since I don't have a car, I was supposed to take the bus. I agreed, mainly to make her happy. I had found a bus arriving at 4 p.m. and told her my arrival time on the day itself, without checking my phone. Then, looking at it, I saw a message from her saying that 4 p.m. would be too late, as they would have left by then. I was stressed. I called her, and she was very judgmental. She spoke to me like a child, criticizing me for my poor organization. I was so stressed that I started crying and apologized. She then replied that it was no big deal, that I shouldn't cry about it, that I could stay and enjoy myself with my friends. I ask her to come pick me up or for them to come see me, but she refuses. She even suggests that I hitchhike, lol? Finally, we agree that I will take the bus as originally planned (I had to come pick up some things anyway).

I arrive at the bottom of her building, and my mother is with my grandparents in the lobby. They seem surprised to see me and tell me they are leaving. I accompany them to their car. That's when the one-on-one conversation with my mother begins. Everything is confusing. I realize that she hadn't even told them I was coming. She says that they were surely happy to see me (for 30 seconds in a parking lot, I might add), that they love me, and asks me if she has the right to tell me that she misses me, etc. She cries. I tell her that maybe I wasn't well organized because I didn't really want to come, that I'm not close to my grandparents. She says she understands and adds that even if it made her cry one day, I should know how to say no to her. I admit that I feel guilty when I say no, that she is my mother, so it's not easy, and that I'm tired of feeling her emotions. I go from anger to tears, I feel like I'm not being understood. I add that it's not normal for me to be in this state of stress. I try to calm down and tell her that I find her very sensitive. She asks me several times, laughing to seek complicity, if she is ‚Äúpathologically hypersensitive.‚Äù She adds, ‚ÄúWe both are a little, aren't we?‚Äù She even tries to give me a hug, but I pull away, anxious, telling her that it's oppressive.

That evening, she sent me a message: ‚ÄúEven though we cried, I was happy to see you.‚Äù It hurts me deeply that she took pleasure in a moment that, for me, was exhausting and distressing.

1mfuit8,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1mfuit8/i_need_help_im_lost/,"I need help, I'm lost","I (20F) come from a Muslim family. I never really chose to be Muslim. I was raised that way, I was formatted that way. I grew up accepting things as they were presented to me, without question. I listened to my parents, I did what I was told, I thought it was normal

Then I grew up. I had access to the Internet, to other ways of living, to other visions of the world. And I began to understand that many things in my life‚Ä¶ were not normal

 For example, in my family (and I imagine this is the case in many Muslim families), women do everything, absolutely everything. My father does nothing, my brothers do nothing, nothing at all. My mother has been cleaning my brothers' room (one is 25, the other 15) forever. They don't cook, they don't tidy up, they don't even know how to press two buttons to make coffee. And everyone thinks that's normal, because ""they're boys."" 

My mother regularly asks me when I'm going to wear the hijab. Not if I want to wear it, but when. And the answer is simple: never. But I don't dare say it

I'm not allowed to go out alone.If I want to go to the store 10 minutes away, I have to go accompanied. And who goes with me? My little brother. Even if he's thinner and shorter than me. It's ridiculous. And if I go out with friends (which is rare, the last time was three years ago), it's a huge stress. My brother calls me every 15 minutes: ""Where are you? Who are you with? What are you doing? Do you have proof?"" I have to send him photos, videos, proof that I'm with girls and not ""doing stupid things"". Of course, my two brothers have the right to be outside whenever they want, wherever they want, and at any time. I'm not allowed to go out just to go out. You need a ""valid"" reason. Buy something, eat somewhere. Otherwise, it's a no. 


My phone is under constant surveillance. If I smile, if I stay on it a little too long, people ask me: ""Who are you talking to? Why are you laughing? Show me your phone."" So I lie. I say I'm talking to two old friends my family knows, even though we haven't spoken to each other for months. In reality, I talk to people I met through my hobbies on Twitter and Reddit or sometimes I just laugh at a YouTube video. But even that seems suspicious.

 When I was 12 or 13, my brother took my phone and blocked all the boys I was in contact with on Snap (they were only friends or classmates), without even telling me. The next day at school, the boys asked me what was going on. I didn't know what to say to them. Since then, he regularly takes my phone, searches my messages, Insta, WhatsApp, everything. I don't have any boy friends anymore. Even though I have nothing to hide, I'm constantly on high alert

Once, he hit me because I didn't want to make him pasta (our mother wasn't there). When I told my mother about it, she laughed. She said, ""Well, you can just make his pasta, he doesn't know how to do it."" And that's it. End of story

When I wanted to apply to university, I targeted the only 4 schools that offered the course I wanted, including one 4 hours from my home (but it's the closest to my home and my mother doesn't care I have to wake up at 3am ig lol). And then, my mother said to me: ""If you don't get into the one next to the house, you change your plans. You won't go to another one."" Why? Because ""women here only leave the house to go to their husbands."" But I don't want to wait for a husband to leave. I don't even want a husband

And even then, I'm stuck. I'm still a student, I'm not allowed to work. I do a little babysitting for a friend of my mother, I'm paid 180‚Ç¨ per month (when she needs me). I save as best I can, I have a small grant. But I could never leave like that. What if I ran away? I'm afraid of what they would do to me. I don't have a plan. And most of all, I love my little brother. My father is kind too. He's not a monster. He was raised by a single mother, so sometimes he cleans, even if he's terrible at cooking. 

But he doesn't decide anything, he does what his wife (my mother) tells him. I still have many years of study to do before I can learn to practice my profession

 That's what breaks me the most: everything I'm going through is because of ""my mother."" A woman. A woman who raised me to be submissive, and who protects my brother at all costs. I don't know if I could talk to her about this, but I know she'll just tell me ""read the coran"" or ""it's the sheitan talking to you."" 

And there's religion. Honestly, I don't know what to think about it. This religion is not a religion of peace. If God existed, would he let children die of hunger or under bombs? Why are all Muslim countries hell for women? And don't tell me ""that's not true Islam."" If so many people misunderstand it, maybe there's a problem with the message üëÅüëÑüëÅ

 I don't consider myself Muslim anymore. But I'm afraid. Afraid that it's true, afraid of going to hell because I don't cover myself, because I don't pray. But I'm also afraid of following everything to the letter, only to find out later that it was false and that I've wasted my life.

 I don't know why I'm writing this post. Maybe because I have no one to talk to. Yesterday, I talked to myself in my room. I do it often. I talk to myself, to feel like someone listen to me ( don't laughüßçüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) 
My brother came in without knocking (no one knocks in this house), he asked me who I was talking to. I shamefully admitted that I was talking to myself. He didn't believe me. He took my phone. He found nothing. He left again. 

I just want to exist. To breathe.

So did y'all go through this? Did y'all  manage to escape? To live freely? I need hope. Just a little

Sorry for my big ass messages and sorry for my English it's not my first language üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è


 Edit : I want to add another story, one day I went to the bathroom, and when I came out my mother yelled at me because according to her I ""pee too loudly"" and the men in the house could hear that ü§° I'm still a bit confuse
