Despite it’s name, *Nimravides* wasn’t a Nimravid (Interestingly, it did coexist with *Barbourofelis*, one of the last Nimravids), instead it was a Machairodont (A group of sabertooth predators, which include the iconic *Smilodon*), within the tribe Homotherinii. Despite similarities to *Machairodus*, to the point it was even considered another species of *Machairodus* ([Anton et al. 2013](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256400013_Machairodont_Adaptations_and_Affinities_of_the_Holarctic_Late_Miocene_Homotherin_Machairodus_Mammalia_Carnivora_Felidae_The_Case_of_Machairodus_Catocopis_Cope_1887), *Nimravides* wasn’t part of *Machairodus*-*Amphimachairodus* lineage. It first appeared in North America around 11 million years ago during the Clarendonian stage of NALMA ([Jiangzuo et al., 2022](https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(22)01909-5?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2589004222019095?showall=true)).

The species, *Nimravides catocopis*, was the last known species of the genus and was the largest of them all. Typically, members of the species were slightly larger than *Machairodus aphanistus*, who could’ve weighed 153 kilograms on average ([Domingo et al., 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pala.12296)). However, the subspecies known as *Nimravides catocopis lahayishupup* (Formerly known as *Machairodus lahayishupup*), grew to even larger sizes. On average, the species could’ve weighed 272 kilograms, with the largest males weighing 427 kilograms, this makes it a contender for one of the largest Felids on the planet. A 2021 paper estimated that *N. c. lahayishupup* could’ve hunted prey between 413 to 1,386 kilograms, with the largest possible prey weighing 1,600 kilograms, suggesting it could’ve hunted animals as large as *Teleoceras*. But they do admit that it may not have been a large prey specialist due to the robust humeri of sabertooths being more suited for subduing prey rather than hunting large species ([Orcutt and Calede, 2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10914-021-09540-1)).

This is further supported by jaw biomechanics which found that sabertooth adaptations were far more ideal to kill more normal sized herbivores instead of megaherbivores as commonly argued ([Andersson et al., 2011](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0024971)). Additionally jaw gape analysis found that *N. catocopis* had a jaw gape of roughly 68° ([Lautenschlager et al., 2020](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.1818)). This is slightly lower than its contemporary rival, *Barbourofelis fricki*, who had a jaw gape maximum of 73° ([Figueirido et al., 2024](https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ar.25451)). So it’s  unlikely *Nimravides* hunted megaherbivores often, and if it did, juveniles would’ve been the preferred prey choice over adults. Unlike its distant relative *Homotherium*, *Nimravides* has a narrower forehead compared to its rostrum, which suggests it may have been more adapted for forested environments ([Jiangzuo et al., 2023](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2023.0019)).

*Amphimachairodus coloradensis* (Depicted in the background) was the oldest officially named North American species. Another unknown species of Amphimachairodus, although dubbed Amphimachairodus cf. horribilis, entered North America at Hh2 ([Jiangzuo and Hulbert, 2021](https://www.academia.edu/49048783/Coexistence_of_Indarctos_and_Amphimachairodus_Carnivora_in_the_Late_Early_Hemphillian_of_Florida_North_America)). While its possible ancestor, *Amphimachairodus horribilis*, was larger than modern day Lions and Tigers, *Amphimachairodus coloradensis* was about the size of modern Lionesses to the lower end of average male Lions, having an average mass of 144 kilograms ([Orcutt and Calede, 2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10914-021-09540-1)). 

However, what it may have made up for its smaller size was an adaptation for more open environments which helped it avoid competition with *Nimravides* ([Jiangzuo et al., 2022](https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(22)01909-5?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2589004222019095?showall=true) and [Jiangzuo et al., 2023](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2023.0019)) In addition, there may have been a possibility that *Amphimachairodus coloradensis* was a gregarious predator (As depicted in this artwork). For one, the adaptations of living in open environments, something commonly seen in the genus. Two, its ancestors, *Amphimachairodus hezhengensis* and the more distant *Machairodus aphanistus*, have been found to be gregarious predators ([Jiangzuo et al., 2023](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2023.0019) and [Salesa et al., 2024](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10914-024-09721-8). *Machairodus*’ case shows that within this lineage, woodland environments didn’t stop the development of gregariousness for the lineage and it was adopted prior to adaptations towards grasslands. 

As mentioned before, both cats would’ve preferred different habitats. But this didn’t stop them from being found in the same locality, Coffee Ranch, Texas. So within Coffee Ranch, competition between the two Homotheres likely happened, but it was likely minimal overall as they aren’t often found in the same areas. Additionally, *Amphimachairodus* was relatively rare, which furthermore diminished competition between the two predators. Because of that, it was likely that *Amphimachairodus* passively replaced *Nimravides*, as the latter couldn’t cope with expansion of grasslands ([Jiangzuo et al., 2022](https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(22)01909-5?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2589004222019095?showall=true)).

Interestingly, one group of competitors seemed to have coexisted with these Homotheres seemingly everywhere during, it wasn’t macropredatory Canids, nor a macropredatory Hyenas, heck not even Nimravids (Although they did coexist with each other across Eurasia), but instead it was the Agriotherines, a tribe of Ursids. Despite their appearance, their closest living relatives was the herbivorous Giant Panda ([Jiangzou et al., 2023](https://bioone.org/journals/american-museum-novitates/volume-2023/issue-3996/3996.1/New-Fossil-Giant-Panda-Relatives-Ailuropodinae-Ursidae--A-Basal/10.1206/3996.1.full)). They’ve been found in Eurasia and North America, and even Africa itself! 

The species depicted in this artwork was *Indarctos oregonensis*, perhaps one of the largest species within the genus. [According to Blaze’s reconstruction, the animal suggests it would’ve stood around 123 cm at the shoulders and likely weighed well over 279 kilograms, as it was larger than Indarctos atticus, who weighed around that much](https://blazze92.deviantart.com/journal/The-largest-known-bear-Part-1-440241554). Unlike modern Ursids, *Indarctos* was presumably a cursorial predator, although not to the level of *Agriotherium* and *Huracan*. It was also possible that *Indarctos oregonensis* was largely carnivorous as well ([Jiangzou et al., 2023](https://bioone.org/journals/american-museum-novitates/volume-2023/issue-3996/3996.1/New-Fossil-Giant-Panda-Relatives-Ailuropodinae-Ursidae--A-Basal/10.1206/3996.1.full)). 

However, another threat to *Amphimachairodus* would’ve been *Huracan schnederi*, as they were more adaptive towards open environments than *Indarctos* and more carnivorous ([Jiangzou et al., 2023](https://bioone.org/journals/american-museum-novitates/volume-2023/issue-3996/3996.1/New-Fossil-Giant-Panda-Relatives-Ailuropodinae-Ursidae--A-Basal/10.1206/3996.1.full)). *Huracan schnederi* was also very large, with one study estimates based on m1 regressions that it weighed 378 kilograms ([Juhn et al., 2024](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/paleobiology/article/cenozoic-climate-change-and-the-evolution-of-north-american-mammalian-predator-ecomorphology/CDF3786B3FA8A1DB57FF6CED340F33F3)),
although another study got an even higher body mass through unknown methods, estimating the Ursid to weigh 510 kilograms ([Hannold, 2019](https://repository.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:760034)).

Isotopic analysis from Optima Fossil Site, Oklahoma, where both predators coexisted with one another, found that they had the largest niche partitioning of any large Carnivora present. *Huracan* was found to be omnivorous as isotopic analysis matched that of the Cave Bear (Which was herbivorous or omnivorous and likely scavenged from other herbivores. The herbivores it consumed were Horses and C3-consuming herbivores, although there is a possibility the isotopic values could mean preference for scavenging larger animals, increased consumption of bone, scavenging/hunting in closed environments, or being less hypercarnivorous than expected. What is likely is probably the combination of the four. *Amphimachairodus coloradensis*, on the other hand, was hunting C3-consuming herbivores and C4-consuming Horses. So while *Huracan* may have lived in more forested environments, *Amphimachairodus* lived in more open environments. Although they both did hunt C3 herbivores, it is very likely they weren’t hunting the same species that often as they still had evidence of a very large niche partitioning ([Fredickerson et al. 2021](https://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app67/app009412021.pdf)).

Interestingly in Yepómera, Mexico, *Huracan* was more carnivorous, hunting Horses that dwell in the grasslands ([Hannold, 2019](https://repository.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:760034)). This does bring up an interesting question, could the presence of large, possibly gregarious Carnivorans play a role in *Huracan* being more omnivorous? 

This was documented in *Arctodus simus*, the largest known bear to roam North America, where RLB specimens tend to be more omnivorous than Beringian specimens ([Figueirido et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18116-0)). Within RLB, *Arctodus* simus coexisted with American Lions and *Smilodon fatalis*, both were the largest hypercarnivores on the continent and both have evidence of gregariousness ([Balisi et al., 2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.07.897348v2.full), [Carbon et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2008.0526), [DeSantis and Shaw, 2018](https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2018AM/webprogram/Paper322567.html), and [Wheeler and Jefferson, 2009](https://www.academia.edu/1231394/PANTHERA_ATROX_BODY_PROPORTIONS_SIZE_SEXUAL_DIMORPHISM_AND_BEHAVIOR_OF_THE_CURSORIAL_LION_OF_THE_NORTH_AMERICAN_PLAINS)). Neither American Lions or Smilodon were found in Beringia, this likely reduced competition if hunting/scavenging large herbivores.

A example (Although more extreme) was *Arctotherium*, which saw a trend towards omnivory because of the increasing diversity of large hypercarnivorous Carnivorans ([Soibelzon and Schubert, 2011](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259887580_The_Largest_Known_Bear_Arctotherium_angustidens_from_the_Early_Pleistocene_Pampean_Region_of_Argentina_With_a_Discussion_of_Size_and_Diet_Trends_in_Bears)). However, *Arctotherium angustidens* was contemporary with *Smilodon populator*, and isotopic analysis found it to have a major consumption of flesh ([Soibelzon et al., 2015](https://www.academia.edu/128203825/South_American_giant_short_faced_bear_Arctotherium_angustidens_diet_evidence_from_pathology_morphology_stable_isotopes_and_biomechanics)). And interestingly enough, *Smilodon populator* was found within the same site with the individuals sampled ([Soibelzon et al., 2008](https://www.academia.edu/1487956/Faunistic_analisys_of_vertebrates_from_las_toscas_del_R%C3%ADo_de_La_Plata_Buenos_Aires_Argentina_a_palaeontological_site_in_disappearance), but ofc more data is needed for this.

This doesn’t mean *Huracan* wasn’t going to be a threat to *Amphimachairodus*, far from it, a Ursid that weighed well over 300 kilograms and maybe pushed 500 kilograms is going to be a threat to *Amphimachairodus*, on occasion. Even if they have a large niche partitioning, conflicts over carcasses are inevitable and a possibility both could’ve predated on each other cubs.

Funny enough, *Amphimachairodus*’ history with Agriotherines goes back even further, extending to the oldest species of the genus, the aforementioned *Amphimachairodus hezhengensis*, where it coexisted with two unnamed  Agriotherine bears the size of *Indarctos atticus*, with these bears and the abundant *Dinocrocuta*, probably triggered more adaptations towards gregariousness, other than open environments, ([Jiangzuo et al., 2023](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2023.0019)). 

Before we go to our last notable rivalry, we have *Adeliosmilus kabir* and *Agriotherium africanium*. Both predators were found in Langebaanweg, South Africa ([Jiangzuo et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2023.107212) and [Valenciano et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.9221)). 

Now let’s talk about *Machairodus aphanistus* and *Indarctos arctoides*, arguably the start of it all. The latter was larger than, with average boars (males) weighing 265 kilograms. However, sows (females) would’ve been slightly smaller than an average *Machairodus*, with average sows weighing 137 kilograms ([Abella et al., 2013](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073711)). The overall average of  the Ursid would be almost 50 kilograms (Around 201 kg) larger than *Machairodus*. Isotopic analysis found a diet of omnivory that leaned towards carnivory, this is interesting despite living with a relatively gregarious Lion-sized Felid ([Domingo et al. 2016](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301687485_Feeding_ecology_and_habitat_preferences_of_top_predators_from_two_Miocene_carnivore-rich_assemblages). On top of that, BAT-3 *Machairodus*’populations showed a slightly more advanced morphotype closer to that of *Amphimachairodus*, which may have coincided with the appearance of Indarctos arctoides, which were found BAT-3 sites and weren’t found in BAT-1 or BAT-2 sites. ([Jiangzuo et al., 2022](https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(22)01909-5?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2589004222019095?showall=true))

Of course, this coexistence came to an end, both *Huracan* and *Agriotherium* would go extinct by the Early Pleistocene and would later be replaced by Ursines ([Jiangzou et al., 2023](https://bioone.org/journals/american-museum-novitates/volume-2023/issue-3996/3996.1/New-Fossil-Giant-Panda-Relatives-Ailuropodinae-Ursidae--A-Basal/10.1206/3996.1.full)). Homotheres would continue to persist into the Late Pleistocene via the lineage Homotherium. Much like Honotherium’s ancestors, they would also have to worry about large Ursids stealing their kills, but these Ursines reached even larger sizes. As mentioned before *Arctodus simus* was the largest bear to ever roam North America and to a lesser extent Brown Bears.

Nevertheless, Homotheres and Agriotherines was the perhaps the longest cat-bear rivalry, lasting well over 5 million years, consisting of multiple taxas. In my opinion, it’s perhaps one of the most interesting stories of the Cenozoic.

so
i recently started working at a new work place after relocating so i have no close friends around me

the city, ppl around me, my routine, everything’s new
prob im feeling a bit lonelier than last year

there’s this one guy who has been scheduled in same shifts multiple times as i did and i found him REALLY cute
his smile, his hair, his beard, him talking, i just want to know more about him
he is such a hard working person from what i saw already

i was able to talk to him for quite long 1-2 hrs during break
i mostly asked about him not too personal questions but just his interests and some tips about the job ive got as first i wanted to be sociable

then when he was talking to another colleague the other day 
i found him cute cute

he was being nice and considerate not to leave me alone awkward by explaining things to me as i asked
he also was explaining about his music playlist after i asked him what kind of coffee he usually gets
mannn

i usually didnt get flattered by these kindness but this time i have been flattered multiple times by him
i think he’s younger than me
he’s so cute

next it was after the busy shift he was checking on me nicely and complimented how i did really well at work offering high fives 
here i got so shy for such small things
he is very gentle when talking to me 
its different to how he talks with other coworkers as i am the only international there

the previous male coworkers i had i regularly hugged them whenever i showed up to work and high fived them raged screamed at them but i didn’t get flattered by them yall 😭

im in my mid-end twenties im not in early twenties
honestly i had boys who were flirting with me or intimately interacting with me before 1 out of 20 boys

unfortunately i ended up having 0 romantic interests on them but only fully friends mode that was all 
i thought/knew they are also just having fun and not being serious at all

i wasn’t romantically/sexually attracted to most of the boys since i haven’t really met boys who made me curious who i want to know more about them

ive been thinking this is bcs of me being bisexual and i only confirmed this just a couple of years ago after moving abroad learning more about diversity
so i thought i basically have different standards towards boys than straight girls 

ive lived in different countries and worked in various environments so this is definitely not my first time being in a such unfamiliar environment to just got stuck in thinking about a guy at work constantly if you understand

whenever i was hearing my psychiatrist telling me to find a guy to date with
i was snorting who tf will i be interested in and in what chance ill find someone im interested in that would actually be interested in me as much as i am at the same time!!!!

im good alone for now i cannot even take good care of myself 😭 im chronically uninterested and unbothered rn based on constant deteriorating & recovering mental health conditions that which everyone also is experiencing in this society 

now im remembering my older senior colleagues always telling me that i should have a boyfriend bcs they think im sweet pretty cute
which i dont agree im insecure from ptsd

i cannot rant this out to my close friends in same age group we all are not that young now and other close friends i met are way younger than i am i feel embarrassed to share that i cannot stop thinking about this guy at work who i only met for a couple of weeks💀

anyways so i don’t deny the fact that i find him attractive from the beginning 
i was looking forward to see him at work all weekend and i showed up smiling wide at him ofc i did my job done clocked in

i think i was smiling too obviously he was actually slightly laughing a bit when i smiled at him passing by
he came to me to chat and joke shortly while being quite close to me too quite often
im honestly not hiding it im intentionally showinf it

i should know whether he has a partner or not 🥸 not 100 sure as he talked about a topic related to his (ex- or current i don’t rmb well) gf who found a job somewhere ish

i will stop looking at him as soon as i know whether he has a partner

but do u think he at least isn’t bothered by me right?

my delusional dreams are already showing me different scenarios please help my brain to brain up

the real fockery is that i was wheezing when my intelligent female friends were turning into one brain cell and crashing out on boys
i think i am doing the same thing now

well even if he’s not interested in me now i know who i can look for either girls or boys right?

I have an open concept main room and I'm at a loss as to how to lay it out.  I redid the floor, which formerly was split into laminate on the kitchen/entry side, and carpet on the living room side, with a tacky metal transition strip down the middle and I hated how it divided the space and limited my layouts.  But now I feel like I have too many options!

Also, I put shelving on the only solid wall, so no matter what my TV is floating in space or blocking a window.  And maybe I have too much furniture?  

Negotiable: The chaise lounge, one or both armchairs, the library chair, the table between the armchairs

Must-keeps: The couch, round side table, TV stand, coffee table, cat trees

The kitchen had a peninsula from out of the left wall that I ripped out and would like to add an island in, maybe; that's a whole other can of worms.  As it is right now, I'm a single person living alone who doesn't host or entertain often, and I have no need for a formal dining space.",1,1761101823.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

I (22M) have been friends with this guy (27M) for almost a year now. We met off of bumble because I had my gender switched to female instead of male (yes I know awful of me). We started talking and he asked if I ever had a guy yet and I said no and he said hot and I responded with are you going to be my first and he said yes. I didn’t know what to expect from it but we hung out twice in December with the first hangout telling me he was straight and wasn’t looking for anything with a guy. We barely talked over winter break but when we came back to school in January, he messaged me asking if I wanted to get food and I said sure. 

When we got food, we just talked and he had complimented me on how I looked cute in my coat. He had asked if I wanted to go out with him to the bars the upcoming weekend and at first I hesitated because I didn’t want to see him approaching any women. We continued to hangout throughout the upcoming months and continuously got food and coffee and we had our own tv show that we would watch. I ended up falling hard for him and wrote a letter being honest about my feelings for him in March. 

I gave him the letter and he said that it was one of the sincerest gifts he had ever received. I noticed that after I gave him that letter, he was definitely more warm towards me and changed his demeanor. We did the same thing of hanging out and going out to the bars/clubs consistently but I began to question our relationship. I knew he was straight but I fell hard for him so we had an honest discussion about what we were doing and he said that for the past 4 months, we have been in a relationship. I told him no because no romance has been involved once but to him we had been dating these past 4 months. There were dynamics within the friendship that made me question this like one of them insisting we pay separately when it came to getting food and at first it was like that but then it became a thing where he paid for food and I did and so on and so forth. I didn’t mind it but to him he insisted he was an adult and could pay for his own things and insisted on going back to this dynamic but we never fully did. 

He would also say very sexual jokes. I know he meant it in a joking way but the way I would joke with my other heterosexual friends  was way different with him. On top of that, he was too knowledgeable on gay lingo such as knowing what cum dumps and bears and otters and other things for him being the straight man he is. 

I graduated from college and moved back home. We kept in touch and met in the middle of the state to see each other again in June. We saw each other in July but this was due to him having his flight diverted to the state capitol and he called me to ask what I was doing. I said I was visiting my father and he told me to come for the night to come spend time with him and hangout. I did and so I drove 3 hours to see him and we hung out. I asked him out of all his friends, why did he call me. He said that he knew I wasn’t the busiest but also how he was also wanting to see me because he missed me. 

We saw each other again in August and again now recently in Miami. All my friends and even strangers I’ve talked to about this situation say he’s gay or bicurious at least. My friend even told me that he’s willingly paying for part of a trip and spending alone time with you and he’s still straight???? I’m just curious of what y’all’s opinion is if he is really gay/bisexual or straight or if I need to include more specific details. Again thank you. ",1,1761101791.0,gayrelationships,0,1.0,False

The last few days have been brutal. I barely eat, nights are the worst because I can't sleep. I've tried following some sort of routine, but my routine revolved around my sweet girl Amy. Yesterday and today I went to the local dog park that we've been going to together for almost 15 years, where I proceeded to break down multiple times in uncontrollable sobs and had complete strangers hugging me. I searched endlessly for tennis balls in the fields even though she was always better at finding them than I was. When I did find one, I threw it as far as I could just for her and imagined I could see her running to get it. 

I broke down in the bookstore that we used to go to together. I broke down watching the fountains she used to enjoy playing in so much. I broke down wasting time at the coffee shop she and I used to go into while playing cards at the table and imagining her on the floor next to me. I've been carrying around the last tennis ball I bought her and found myself squeezing it multiple times throughout the day.

I have my first therapy appointment scheduled for a couple of days, but I don't know how to survive this heartbreak. I've been temporarily staying with family and spending a couple of hours here and there at my place, but I can't get used to the silence. I find myself burrowing myself in the blankets that still smell like her and staring into a void that I can't escape.

I haven't smiled since the day Amy left, and I hate that I can't guide her and keep her safe on her next adventure. I hate the possibility that I'll never see her smiling face again. I want father time to take the knife that he stabbed my heart with to free these thorns from my soul.

Now a punk venue called ""baga yaga"". This is one of the more accurate looking locations in the game so far. 

2 is right next to the former boxHouse both in real life and in the game. It's a bar known as ""the Meyer"". 

3 is a vintage shop (owned by a friend of mine irl actually) called bon voyage. They are a neat little vintage clothing shop that specializes in pieces from local artists

4 is not so much a location, but more just showing how accurate they were with the signage that is currently in pioneer square

5 is a little coffee shop that in real life is called cafe darte, also pretty accurate in appearance to its real life counter parts

6 is located right next door to 5 in real life, it's called ""unos pizza"". The owner is a awesome dude and they have a killer Turkish beef pizza that, while not looking very appetizing, it's super yummy

7 is one of three bars that claim to be the oldest in Seattle, j&m cafe. However it's been closed and vacant irl since last decade

8 is right next to 7 irl and in the game, in real life it's called ""Mediterranean mix"" and is home to the creator of the Seattle dog (a hog dog with cream cheese, grilled onions and jalapenos) 

9 is next to 8 and 7 irl but it's a couple blocks over in the game. It's is one of the other 3 bars that claim to be the oldest in Seattle, (and in my opinion is, based on a technicality), the central saloon, famous for being one of the most popular venues of the grunge era in Seattle

Hello r/WallStreetBets and robotics enthusiasts! 

Richtech Robotics (RR) has been quietly perfecting its flagship robot, ADAM, for years, and now they’re ready to unveil a new, full-body humanoid at NVIDIA GTC (Oct 27-29, 2025, D.C.) that could surpass Tesla’s Optimus. 

This isn’t ADAM 3.0—it’s a distinct humanoid leveraging Richtech’s proven tech. Hold your RR shares; this could be big.

ADAM has been operational in real-world settings, serving over 16,000 drinks at venues like Kennedy Space Center and Toyota Arena. Its hardware was ahead of its time:

	•	Robust arms: Designed for precise tasks like mixing cocktails, brewing coffee, and handling high-volume service at events, including for the U.S. Space Force.

	•	Expressive display: A face-like screen for engaging customer interactions.

	•	Advanced vision and voice: Cameras for navigating busy environments and voice AI for natural communication.

Before the AI revolution, ADAM was limited—a powerful body executing pre-programmed tasks like bartending or serving. It lacked the intelligence for complex decision-making. 

The AI boom, powered by NVIDIA’s edge computing (ADAM notably served NVIDIA’s CEO at a prior GTC), transformed it. ADAM 3.0 now adapts in real-time, adjusts coffee brewing based on conditions, and anticipates customer needs using enhanced vision-AI. Richtech simply integrated AI into ADAM’s existing frame, instantly upgrading its capabilities without a hardware overhaul.

The new humanoid builds on this. ADAM provides the perfect upper body, while Richtech’s other robots, like the Matradee Plus (a food delivery bot navigating restaurants flawlessly), supply proven mobility tech. By combining these, Richtech is creating a complete humanoid—likely bipedal or wheeled-hybrid—faster than competitors. 

Tesla’s Optimus is still in development, but Richtech’s robots are already generating revenue in hospitality, giving them a head start in deploying practical humanoids for real jobs like bartending or hotel service.

At GTC, expect a reveal of this NVIDIA-powered humanoid, ready to work smarter and faster. With years of groundwork, Richtech is positioned to lead.

1ocwohi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1ocwohi/i_am_a_paranormal_research_agent_this_is_my_story/,"I am a Paranormal Research Agent, this is my story. Case #001 ""The bus to Nowhere""","My name is Elijah Wiltburrow. I've been advised that I'll need to redact certain things from this statement, not that many of you would believe a lot of this. I don't mean to insult you all, but most people don't seem to take anything paranormal with more than a grain of salt, maybe at most something to believe in for the thrill of believing that something is out there. Well, there is.

At the time of this story, I had been newly hired by an organisation that specialises in the study of the paranormal. I can't say the name of the organisation for obvious reasons, but I was drawn to it for two very important reasons.

The first reason is that I have always been drawn to the paranormal. Growing up, I was fascinated with ghost stories and read all I could on the subject. This later blossomed into me studying parapsychology, which leads me to my second reason for joining this organisation. It is very difficult to get a job when you're primarily a scholar of a defunct field of study. ""Debunked"" isn't technically the word I'd use.

It's real. I knew it at the time, and I sure as hell know it now, but that's not the point of this statement.

My friend and fellow field research operative, Lily Heinz, had accompanied me on my first job assignment. Now, Lily Heinz is a psychic. I think this is important to clarify now before we continue.

She had an episode a few months prior to this case and was “scouted” by the organisation. I use those quotation marks because it was really an ultimatum: work for them or… well, I think you can fill in the rest.

She hadn't been a particularly powerful psychic in the time I had known her, but she was aware enough to sense when some paranormal energy was around. A helpful tool in our line of work.

Now this was my first case of my career, and I didn't really know what to expect. I mean, when you are told that there is a likely paranormal bus picking people up in the middle of the night, well, it kind of kicks any expectations out of your head.

We sat inside of Lily's car; the cold night air was thick, and a fitting, almost comical fog had swept in a few hours previously. Her car's heater had died a few weeks previously, so we both sat in an awkward silence wearing our heavy puffer jackets, struggling to stay awake.

We were parked on the side of one of the few roads entering the small mining town of \[REDACTED\], the street itself wasn't anything special, just a gravel road and high trees.

A few hundred feet down from us was a single street lamp with a bus sign hanging off it; the lamp was off. We both watched the street lamp with unwavering concentration; the dossier I was given for this case had explained that from the hours of 11 pm to 4:35 am a mystery bus would come and pick up hitchhikers.

And so here we are, waiting at 1 am for a bus or something to show up. I remember feeling a certain excitement from all of this; I'm pretty sure it's the only thing that kept me awake. Lily was less enthused. This was our second night surveying the site, and last night we hadn't gotten anything. She was quick to say that this was likely just another local legend that we could log as a ""myth"" in the paperwork, but the rules are the rules, we have to survey a site for at least two weeks if the paranormal entity or object doesn't abide by time regulations.

""Looks like we have someone,"" she said. Her words broke my concentration on the street lamp, and I raised the camera I had with me and zoomed in on the figure. It was a woman wearing a heavy jumper and what looked like a backpack. A runaway, maybe?

As she got closer to the street lamp, I looked at lily, she winced her eyes and looked at me.

""There is definitely something here, Elijah,"" she said with tension.

""How can you tell?"" I asked, but as I said this, the street lamp suddenly lit alight, the bus sign illuminated, and a small bench that I hadn't seen in the dark sat underneath it.

""Shit,"" I blurted out before I grabbed the door handle, but she grabbed my shoulder and held me back.

""We have to watch, this is our job, rookie,"" Lily said to me sternly.

The woman cautiously walked up to the bench and took a seat. She sat there for a few minutes, and we watched, took photos and notes, all protocol. After at most five minutes, I heard an engine coming from behind us. I looked in the rear-view mirror and saw two bright lights approaching from the distance.

An old transit bus pulled up, and the women and the sign were obscured from view. I took some photos, and Lily looked like she was concentrating on something; she had her eyes closed and hand slightly outstretched towards the bus. After a minute, the bus's engines came back to life and drove away, and the street lamp turned off. Lily pressed her foot down, and the car began to wheel out off the side of the road and follow the bus, but after five or so minutes, the bus was gone. It didn't vanish like a ghost or melt away; it just simply disappeared.

She got out of the car and grabbed something out of the trunk, then she walked towards the side of the road and stabbed something into the dirt; it was a GPS pin. a portable tracker that, when turned off, left a pin on your GPS, helpful for when you're tracking things in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night.





We drove back to \[REDACTED\] and stayed in an old motel. It was just before 2 in the morning when I dropped like a tonne of bricks onto the bed. I drifted to bed immediately and awoke to the sound of knocking on the motel room door. I shot up and walked over to the window, looking out onto the walkway outside the door, and saw Lily standing there in a pair of jeans, a black button-up and her red hair tied back into a ponytail.

I looked at the alarm clock next to my bed, and it read 10.

""Shit!"" I remember saying before I opened the door. Lily looked at me and smiled.

""The best thing about working cases at night is that you can sleep like hell through the day. Enjoy it; soon you won't be able to sleep much at all,"" she said before placing a cup of coffee in my hand. I didn't even realise she was holding one. I took a sip and let the warm, beautiful sensation of coffee flood my empty stomach.

""You smoke?"" she asked while holding a box of cigarettes in her offhand.

""Ehh, no,"" I said awkwardly, and she shrugged before lighting one up.

She looked at me inquisitively. She leaned back on the table that sat opposite the end of my bed, and I sat on the bed, coffee in one hand and my head in the other.

""So what did we see last night?"" she asked.

I looked at her confused.

""The… bus?"" I said, genuinely confused, which made her sigh.

""Yes, the bus. What do you think it was?"" she said. I got the impression that she wasn't asking and that this was a test, and so I focused on what I had learnt leading up to this. Even before I was hired by the organisation, I had studied stuff like this for years.

""Well, the bus itself is clearly odd, it doesn't show up on any transport schedule or follow any routine, and yet it knew when that woman was there. It must be parked nearby or—"" My concentration broke. ""Shit, that woman. Has there been any news of her?"" I asked.

""Yes and no. Betty James was reported missing a few hours ago, and from what it looks like, she was running away from home, just like the others,"" she said before taking another swig of her smoke.

""Plus, the rate of people running away is significantly higher here than anywhere else in the surrounding areas, probably related, but I'm not sure how,"" she continued.

""And are we sure this thing is paranormal? Maybe it's just a coincidence."" I felt stupid for asking.

""Rookie, trust me, this is definitely paranormal. I got a feeling."" That feeling she got was what I'd later learn was her own paranormal awareness.

""Ok, so what's our next move? We can't keep watching, we know next to nothing about this thing,"" I said.

""I agree, we need eyes on this thing,"" she said with a malicious grin. The air in the shitty motel room suddenly grew thick as I realised what she was asking.

""You must be joking; I can't go on that thing. We don't even know where it goes.""

""You're right, we don't know dick besides where it disappears and what times it appears. Don't worry, I'm not sending you alone, I'll be coming with,"" she said and threw the smoke bud into the drain of the sink in the small kitchen.

""Till then, write down your notes and statement on last night's events, and try to rest up for tonight,"" she said whilst walking out of the room. She gave me a mischievous look when I realised that she gave me coffee when I definitely don't need the caffeine. Say what you will about Lily and her ""arrangement"" with the organisation, but she definitely knew how to make a joke in any situation.





After a day of tossing and turning, trying and failing to fall asleep, I eventually had to get up and get ready for work. It was 8 pm, and the night air was crisp. Lily drove us out to a diner on the edge of town, and I immediately ordered myself a black coffee.

""Didn't sleep well?"" Lily asked with a smile that said she was genuine but with a look that said she knew the answer.

""Surely I can report you for this,"" I said jokingly, although a part of me was genuinely interested in following this up. She laughed, and after a moment my coffee arrived. I took a sip, and Lily lifted a small backpack off the ground and onto the table.

I can't go into the specifics, of course, but imagine a ghost-hunting survival kit. The closest thing I can compare it to is shark hunting with a spear. Sure, you can harm the shark, but the chances of it harming you are still far too high once you're in its waters, and tonight we were diving right in.

A few hours later we pulled up to the side of the road across from the bus stop, the same spot as last night. We both got out, photographed the bus stop and walked over. The light for some reason didn't turn on when we approached, but we both had torches and a small wind-up lamp that had some power to it.

We waited for what felt like hours as we sat at the bus stop, and eventually, to what felt like our luck, the light lit up.

""Something is definitely here,"" Lily said, and as I looked at her, she held two fingers against her left eyebrow, as if there was tension there.

""Ehh, hello?"" A voice said from the left of us. I look over, and a young man, maybe 19, was standing there with a large bag and a puffer jacket. Shit, it wasn't waiting for anyone; it was waiting for people running away.

""Hey bud, how are you?"" I said in the friendliest tone I could, which I now realise would've been extremely unnerving considering the circumstances. I was only a few years older than this guy, and I tried to seem as natural as possible.

""I'm… good,"" the runaway said whilst still standing a few metres away.

""Elijah, heads up,"" Lily said silently after she placed a hand on my shoulder. I looked up at her, and she nodded her head towards the distance where two headlights shone towards us.

""So what brings you out of town? Going on a trip?"" I said as naturally as I could. Lily later told me that I weirded even her out.

""N-no… I just need to get out of this town, y'know,"" he said after a long moment.

The bus passed me and Lily and stopped directly in front of the runaway. This thing really had a target, but we both jogged over to the runaway and lined up behind him. The runaway was the first to enter, and after he stepped on, the door tried to shut but stopped midway through before slowly opening again, almost like it was reluctant to let us on.

We stepped up the steep metallic steps, and I tried to get a look at the bus driver, but from all I could see in the very dark bus was that he wore a typical bus driver uniform and sunglasses. He made no moves to greet or even acknowledge us. Lily was behind me, and after walking slowly down the aisle, I sat on the middle left-hand side of the bus, a few seats down from the runaway, and Lily sat across from me.

Besides our already established caution and scepticism, I felt like this place was really off. The bus was humid, and a sour smell hung in the air; it smelt almost like meat, but I couldn't place what animal.

The bus's engine came to life slowly, and it began to wheel down the lone country road towards \[REDACTED\].

""Elijah, stay focused; we need to take notes on what this thing is,"" Lily said before taking out her notebook and writing some notes. I reached into my bag and grabbed my camcorder.

The camcorder struggled to turn on. I now know that paranormal events and entities create a type of dead zone for technology or at the very least interfere with it greatly.

I was too distracted by the camcorder to realise that it was approaching until it grabbed hold of my shoulder. The bus driver held onto me, and I felt its fingers sink into me.

I looked up and saw its face staring down at me. Well, I looked at where its face should be; what was there was nothing. I need to stress that it wasn't flat like a smooth option; I mean, there was a hole where its face should be, and inside was a void.

""FUCK,"" I screamed. ""LILY,"" I continued, and as I looked at her, I realised she had her fingers on her forehead. She looked like she was in pain but was focused. I put my left hand on the bus driver's hand, trying to shift it off, and with my other hand I dig into my bag, looking for something.

I pulled out a small plastic bag filled with small white crystals. I opened the bag with my right hand and pushed it into the bus driver, which caused it to flinch back in pain and let go of my shoulder. Silver halide, or ""silver salt"", is like kryptonite to most paranormal creatures.

The creature made a hissing noise and fell back into a chair. I jumped out of the chair, and the adrenaline propelled me towards the driver's seat to try and pull the brakes, but it wouldn't budge.

I looked back towards the back half of the bus, and I noticed the hitchhiker; she was clearly dead. Her eyes were white and milky, and her skin was pale and thin.

""How did it get to him so quick?"" I thought, and I quickly looked back at the bus driver, and it stood up out of the chair and shrieked at me. It was next to Lily but completely ignored her, which meant I was in danger, real danger.

This was the moment that I realised what type of work I was in; it wasn't just going to sites and checking urban myths, it was standing in front of things that shouldn't exist and just trying to survive.

It leapt at me, and I shielded my arms out in front of me. I heard a metallic slam, and I opened my eyes to see it wriggling on the floor. I looked over at Lily and saw her hand outstretched towards the creature, and her eyes were rolled back.

""ELIJAH, USE THE RUNESTONE."" She yelled at me before throwing a cloth sack at me. I nodded my head and reached into the sack and grabbed a small stone pebble that had a rune etched into it. I had always been good with the study of languages, so when I saw the rune etched into the stone, I remembered what the intent was. I slammed it against the bus door and shouted “útlagr!”, an old Norse word meaning “banish”. When said with intent with this runestone, you can temporarily banish things not from our plane.

As I said this, my surroundings suddenly turned to mist, and I fell hard on some gravel. I had rolled for a few feet and was convinced that I had broken my shoulder; I held onto it and groaned. I looked around and saw Lily a few feet away.

""You okay?"" she asked. She held onto her ankle, and when I looked down at it, I realised that it must've twisted in an unnatural way.

""I'm fine. What the hell was that?"" I asked in between shallow breaths.

""A Lophiiformes-type entity. You're lucky; this was one hell of a first case, rookie,"" she said before laying back and breathing hard. What she did on the bus took a lot out of her, and she was close to passing out completely.





I called in to our higher-ups, and they dispatched some backup. A few hours before dawn, we had six people on the site surveying the bus stop. Before long, it was exorcised, and all that stands there now is a bus bench along an old country road.

I got chewed out for using a runestone. For those who don't know, runestones are incredibly rare; almost all of them can be traced back to an incredibly powerful witch in eighth-century Norway who created a couple thousand. How Lily was able to get her hands on one is beyond me, but without it, I'm convinced we'd be dead.

Lily got chewed out for putting us in that situation; her relationship with the organisation is different from mine. For them, I am an employee, but for her, it's a lot stricter. She wasn't fired and was allocated to the role of my partner indefinitely, which still stands today.

For those of you still reading, I thank you. You might be wondering why I am writing this and why I am interested in publicising some of my work if it means it would be censored. Simple. I think I am going to die. Something is hunting me, and it has for some time now, and as a scholar, I wish for some trace of my work to be out there.

Anywho, I advise all who are still reading to please stay away from any thoughts of suddenly wanting to run away in the middle of the night and to especially stay away from any bus stops on the edge of town. You may very well just be prey. ",1,1761100974.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False
1ocwoaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/flrdating/comments/1ocwoaz/28_m4f_australiaanywhereonline_obedient_sub/,28 [M4F] #Australia/Anywhere/Online – Obedient sub searching for his Dom mommy for FLR Dating😊,"Hello there 👋🏻 wonderful lassies I’m a 28-year-old sub gent from Australia, and I’d love to meet someone who’s up for something genuine, curious, and playful. I’m happiest when I’m outdoors: wandering through a national park, ambling along a quiet countryside track, or exploring a museum on a rainy afternoon. Simple things light me up, good coffee, interesting conversation, a song that catches me off guard, or a sunset that makes everything feel a bit softer.

I can be a little reserved at first, but once you get me talking I tend to open up fast. I love conversations that move from the serious and thoughtful to the absolutely ridiculous, and I value someone who can do both. Laughing until it hurts and then switching into a sincere late-night chat is very much my vibe.

A few things I nerd out about: history and applied linguistics fascinate me (I could happily get lost in a book about language change or historical quirks). Geopolitics and agriculture interest me too partly because they shape people’s lives in such concrete ways. Music is a constant companion, and I enjoy the occasional video game for relaxing downtime. I’m curious by nature and always keen to learn something new, whether that’s an odd historical anecdote or a surprisingly beautiful hiking route.

I’m also upfront about who I am in relationships: I identify as an obedient submissive. For me that means I’m drawn to a dynamic where trust, clear communication, and consent are central. I enjoy taking a responsive role when the connection and boundaries are right, it’s about giving up control in a way that feels safe, respectful, and mutually satisfying. I take responsibility for communicating limits, aftercare needs, and expectations honestly, reciprocity and emotional safety are non-negotiable. If that resonates with you, I’d love to find someone who understands power exchange and values trust and care as much as I do.

When it comes to what I want, I don’t have a rigid checklist. I’m looking for someone kind, curious, and emotionally available, someone who enjoys conversation, gentle banter, and quiet moments alike. Chemistry matters more than distance to me, I’m open to meeting people anywhere in the world and exploring where things might go, whether that becomes a deep friendship, a meaningful partnership, or something wonderfully in between.

A few things I bring to the table: loyalty, patience, and a playful sense of humor. I’m thoughtful and attentive, and I enjoy making small gestures that show I care, remembering a detail you mentioned, planning a thoughtful day out, or simply being a steady presence on a tough one. I value honesty and clear boundaries, and I expect the same in return.

If you like hikes, history rabbit holes, late-night chats, and a bit of playful submission in a trusting, consensual context, we’ll probably get on well. Don't have a chat app preference, I’m flexible.

If any of this resonates, send me a message. Let’s start with a conversation and see where the spark takes us. No pressure, just curiosity, care, and the possibility of something real 😊",1,1761100961.0,flrdating,0,1.0,False

I recently moved to Milwaukee and am hoping to get more involved in the community while pursuing a few of my personal interests.

I’m particularly interested in real estate investing and would like to connect with others in the area who share that passion. If you know of any local networking events, meetups, or individuals open to a coffee chat or mentorship, I’d greatly appreciate any recommendations.

I’m also looking to get involved in farm or agriculture-related work or volunteering. I reached out to the Milwaukee Urban Stables, but they mentioned they’re currently full on volunteers. If anyone knows of other farms, stables, or agricultural programs in or around Milwaukee that could use an extra hand, I’d like to hear about them.

1ocwlq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusMentalHealth/comments/1ocwlq0/using_timers_for_productivity_a_personal/,Using Timers for Productivity: A Personal Experiment,"Lately I’ve had *huge gains in productivity* by using a **timer-based method**. I tried the classic **Pomodoro Technique** (*25 minutes of work, 5 minutes break*) but found that even 25 minutes felt too long for my brain. So I switched it up: **10 minutes work / 10 minutes break**. (in my breaks I’ll usually still do “work” but the more shiny, enjoyable tasks-phone calls, receipts, snack, coffee)

The shift? **Amazing.** The short bursts help me get into motion, avoid *task paralysis*, and *gamify my day* (work → reward → work → reward). It’s changed the way I tackle busy parts of my day, especially when *executive function* feels blocked.

  
**What Is the Timer Method for Productivity?** ***(Short Explanation)***

Set a **timer** for a fixed interval of focused work, followed by a short break — then repeat. The timer creates *urgency* and *structure*, while the breaks help you *recharge*, *regulate attention*, and *prevent burnout*.

  
**Does the Pomodoro Technique Work for ADHD?**

Good news: yes, there’s evidence it *can* help people with **Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)** — especially when adapted.

* The **Pomodoro technique** gives *external structure*, supporting *executive-function challenges* like *task initiation*, *time-blindness*, and *distractibility*.  [Read more on Choosing Therapy](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/pomodoro-technique-adhd/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* Many experts recommend *shortening intervals* for ADHD brains — for example, 10-15 minute sessions can be ideal for *sustaining focus*.  [Psych Central: How to Adapt the Pomodoro Technique for ADHD](https://psychcentral.com/adhd/how-to-adapt-the-pomodoro-technique-adhd/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* One neurodivergent-focused blog notes: *Shorter sessions help reduce overwhelm and build momentum* — perfect for *ADHD productivity*.  [Life Skills Advocate: Pomodoro for ADHD](https://lifeskillsadvocate.com/blog/pomodoro-technique-for-adhd/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

At the same time:

* Some people find strict timers *disrupt hyperfocus* or *break flow*.  [ADHD UK: Pros and Cons of Pomodoro](https://adhduk.co.uk/2023/05/11/pomodoro-technique-the-good-and-the-bad/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The takeaway: **Experiment**. Try, tweak, and find *your rhythm*.

  
**My Take —** ***Gamifying Productivity***

Because I’ve played with a shorter cycle (**10-10 instead of 25-5**), here’s what I learned — and what I’d encourage anyone with *executive-function paralysis* or *ADHD* to try:

* **Gamify your day** — break tasks into “work → reward → work → reward.” The short timers feel like *rounds in a game* and keep motivation high.
* **Don’t wait for perfect focus** — shorter bursts make it easier to *just start*, building *momentum* quickly.
* **Adapt the interval** — if 25 feels too long, try 10/10 or 15/5. The *structure* matters more than the numbers.
* **Make breaks meaningful** — stretch, walk, breathe, drink water — *real reset moments* boost *mental clarity*.
* **Track your wins** — use a notebook, app, or timer log to see progress and *boost dopamine*.
* **Be kind to yourself** — if you miss a round, adjust. The goal is *consistency over perfection*.

  
**Final Word**

If you ever feel *overwhelmed*, *stuck*, or *struggle with task initiation*, try using **focus timers**. Whether it’s the **Pomodoro Technique** or your own *ADHD-friendly version*, the idea is to **start small**, **celebrate micro-wins**, and **turn productivity into play**.

It’s helped me *exponentially* — and it might just help you reclaim your focus, energy, and motivation too.",1,1761100751.0,AusMentalHealth,0,1.0,False

**Feeling Stiff After 50? 🤸‍♀️Try This 5-Minute ""Desk Detox"" Routine: (And ditch the afternoon slump!)**

Hey RetirementReady friends!

Anyone else feel like they're slowly turning into a tin man after a few hours at their desk? Seriously, some days I swear my joints creak louder than my morning coffee grinder! 😅

Look, we're all about making the most of this amazing phase of life. But feeling achy and sluggish? That's a *hard pass*. It's tough to explore new hobbies, travel, or even just enjoy time with grandkids when your body is protesting every move.

So, I wanted to share something that’s been a game-changer for me: a super simple 5-minute ""Desk Detox"" routine.

Think of it as a quick reset button for your body (and mind!). No fancy equipment needed, just you and a little bit of space.

Here’s the deal:

*   **Neck Rolls (1 minute):** Gentle circles, forward and back. Pretend you're drawing with your nose! Tension release level: Expert.
*   **Shoulder Shrugs (1 minute):** Up to your ears, then relax them down. Feel that tension melt away!
*   **Torso Twists (1 minute):** Seated or standing, gently twist side to side. Like you’re trying to see who’s gossiping about you. 😉
*   **Wrist & Ankle Circles (1 minute):** Rotate those joints! Key for typing and… well, walking.
*   **Leg Extensions (1 minute):** While seated, extend each leg straight out, flexing your foot. Hold for a second, then lower. Hello circulation!

Seriously, that's it. Five minutes. You can do it between emails, during a conference call (camera off, of course!), or whenever you feel that afternoon slump creeping in.

I know, I know. It sounds too good to be true. But trust me, even this small burst of movement can make a HUGE difference. It's about consistently choosing to add movement to your daily routine.

Speaking of choices, ever feel like you're just not getting enough variety in your movement routines? I recently stumbled upon this really interesting resource that talks about a TON of different at-home workouts, including Yoga that focus on getting rid of the stiffness. **We believe in strongest people.** Turns out, there is this amazing guide, with simple workouts that anyone can follow, it is absolutely FREE! Check it out here: [https://liveitupdeals-hub.github.io/online-yoga-and-at-home-workouts](https://liveitupdeals-hub.github.io/online-yoga-and-at-home-workouts).

Anyway, I’m curious... What are some *your* favorite quick ways to sneak movement into your day? And does anyone else relate to the “tin man” feeling? Let’s compare creaky joints and share tips!

1ocwjl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1ocwjl3/i_am_a_paranormal_research_agent_this_is_my_story/,"I am a Paranormal Research Agent, this is my story. Case #001 ""The bus to Nowhere""","My name is Elijah Wiltburrow. I've been advised that I'll need to redact certain things from this statement, not that many of you would believe a lot of this. I don't mean to insult you all, but most people don't seem to take anything paranormal with more than a grain of salt, maybe at most something to believe in for the thrill of believing that something is out there. Well, there is.

At the time of this story, I had been newly hired by an organisation that specialises in the study of the paranormal. I can't say the name of the organisation for obvious reasons, but I was drawn to it for two very important reasons.

The first reason is that I have always been drawn to the paranormal. Growing up, I was fascinated with ghost stories and read all I could on the subject. This later blossomed into me studying parapsychology, which leads me to my second reason for joining this organisation. It is very difficult to get a job when you're primarily a scholar of a defunct field of study. ""Debunked"" isn't technically the word I'd use.

It's real. I knew it at the time, and I sure as hell know it now, but that's not the point of this statement.

My friend and fellow field research operative, Lily Heinz, had accompanied me on my first job assignment. Now, Lily Heinz is a psychic. I think this is important to clarify now before we continue.

She had an episode a few months prior to this case and was “scouted” by the organisation. I use those quotation marks because it was really an ultimatum: work for them or… well, I think you can fill in the rest.

She hadn't been a particularly powerful psychic in the time I had known her, but she was aware enough to sense when some paranormal energy was around. A helpful tool in our line of work.

Now this was my first case of my career, and I didn't really know what to expect. I mean, when you are told that there is a likely paranormal bus picking people up in the middle of the night, well, it kind of kicks any expectations out of your head.

We sat inside of Lily's car; the cold night air was thick, and a fitting, almost comical fog had swept in a few hours previously. Her car's heater had died a few weeks previously, so we both sat in an awkward silence wearing our heavy puffer jackets, struggling to stay awake.

We were parked on the side of one of the few roads entering the small mining town of \[REDACTED\], the street itself wasn't anything special, just a gravel road and high trees.

A few hundred feet down from us was a single street lamp with a bus sign hanging off it; the lamp was off. We both watched the street lamp with unwavering concentration; the dossier I was given for this case had explained that from the hours of 11 pm to 4:35 am a mystery bus would come and pick up hitchhikers.

And so here we are, waiting at 1 am for a bus or something to show up. I remember feeling a certain excitement from all of this; I'm pretty sure it's the only thing that kept me awake. Lily was less enthused. This was our second night surveying the site, and last night we hadn't gotten anything. She was quick to say that this was likely just another local legend that we could log as a ""myth"" in the paperwork, but the rules are the rules, we have to survey a site for at least two weeks if the paranormal entity or object doesn't abide by time regulations.

""Looks like we have someone,"" she said. Her words broke my concentration on the street lamp, and I raised the camera I had with me and zoomed in on the figure. It was a woman wearing a heavy jumper and what looked like a backpack. A runaway, maybe?

As she got closer to the street lamp, I looked at lily, she winced her eyes and looked at me.

""There is definitely something here, Elijah,"" she said with tension.

""How can you tell?"" I asked, but as I said this, the street lamp suddenly lit alight, the bus sign illuminated, and a small bench that I hadn't seen in the dark sat underneath it.

""Shit,"" I blurted out before I grabbed the door handle, but she grabbed my shoulder and held me back.

""We have to watch, this is our job, rookie,"" Lily said to me sternly.

The woman cautiously walked up to the bench and took a seat. She sat there for a few minutes, and we watched, took photos and notes, all protocol. After at most five minutes, I heard an engine coming from behind us. I looked in the rear-view mirror and saw two bright lights approaching from the distance.

An old transit bus pulled up, and the women and the sign were obscured from view. I took some photos, and Lily looked like she was concentrating on something; she had her eyes closed and hand slightly outstretched towards the bus. After a minute, the bus's engines came back to life and drove away, and the street lamp turned off. Lily pressed her foot down, and the car began to wheel out off the side of the road and follow the bus, but after five or so minutes, the bus was gone. It didn't vanish like a ghost or melt away; it just simply disappeared.

She got out of the car and grabbed something out of the trunk, then she walked towards the side of the road and stabbed something into the dirt; it was a GPS pin. a portable tracker that, when turned off, left a pin on your GPS, helpful for when you're tracking things in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night.





We drove back to \[REDACTED\] and stayed in an old motel. It was just before 2 in the morning when I dropped like a tonne of bricks onto the bed. I drifted to bed immediately and awoke to the sound of knocking on the motel room door. I shot up and walked over to the window, looking out onto the walkway outside the door, and saw Lily standing there in a pair of jeans, a black button-up and her red hair tied back into a ponytail.

I looked at the alarm clock next to my bed, and it read 10.

""Shit!"" I remember saying before I opened the door. Lily looked at me and smiled.

""The best thing about working cases at night is that you can sleep like hell through the day. Enjoy it; soon you won't be able to sleep much at all,"" she said before placing a cup of coffee in my hand. I didn't even realise she was holding one. I took a sip and let the warm, beautiful sensation of coffee flood my empty stomach.

""You smoke?"" she asked while holding a box of cigarettes in her offhand.

""Ehh, no,"" I said awkwardly, and she shrugged before lighting one up.

She looked at me inquisitively. She leaned back on the table that sat opposite the end of my bed, and I sat on the bed, coffee in one hand and my head in the other.

""So what did we see last night?"" she asked.

I looked at her confused.

""The… bus?"" I said, genuinely confused, which made her sigh.

""Yes, the bus. What do you think it was?"" she said. I got the impression that she wasn't asking and that this was a test, and so I focused on what I had learnt leading up to this. Even before I was hired by the organisation, I had studied stuff like this for years.

""Well, the bus itself is clearly odd, it doesn't show up on any transport schedule or follow any routine, and yet it knew when that woman was there. It must be parked nearby or—"" My concentration broke. ""Shit, that woman. Has there been any news of her?"" I asked.

""Yes and no. Betty James was reported missing a few hours ago, and from what it looks like, she was running away from home, just like the others,"" she said before taking another swig of her smoke.

""Plus, the rate of people running away is significantly higher here than anywhere else in the surrounding areas, probably related, but I'm not sure how,"" she continued.

""And are we sure this thing is paranormal? Maybe it's just a coincidence."" I felt stupid for asking.

""Rookie, trust me, this is definitely paranormal. I got a feeling."" That feeling she got was what I'd later learn was her own paranormal awareness.

""Ok, so what's our next move? We can't keep watching, we know next to nothing about this thing,"" I said.

""I agree, we need eyes on this thing,"" she said with a malicious grin. The air in the shitty motel room suddenly grew thick as I realised what she was asking.

""You must be joking; I can't go on that thing. We don't even know where it goes.""

""You're right, we don't know dick besides where it disappears and what times it appears. Don't worry, I'm not sending you alone, I'll be coming with,"" she said and threw the smoke bud into the drain of the sink in the small kitchen.

""Till then, write down your notes and statement on last night's events, and try to rest up for tonight,"" she said whilst walking out of the room. She gave me a mischievous look when I realised that she gave me coffee when I definitely don't need the caffeine. Say what you will about Lily and her ""arrangement"" with the organisation, but she definitely knew how to make a joke in any situation.





After a day of tossing and turning, trying and failing to fall asleep, I eventually had to get up and get ready for work. It was 8 pm, and the night air was crisp. Lily drove us out to a diner on the edge of town, and I immediately ordered myself a black coffee.

""Didn't sleep well?"" Lily asked with a smile that said she was genuine but with a look that said she knew the answer.

""Surely I can report you for this,"" I said jokingly, although a part of me was genuinely interested in following this up. She laughed, and after a moment my coffee arrived. I took a sip, and Lily lifted a small backpack off the ground and onto the table.

I can't go into the specifics, of course, but imagine a ghost-hunting survival kit. The closest thing I can compare it to is shark hunting with a spear. Sure, you can harm the shark, but the chances of it harming you are still far too high once you're in its waters, and tonight we were diving right in.

A few hours later we pulled up to the side of the road across from the bus stop, the same spot as last night. We both got out, photographed the bus stop and walked over. The light for some reason didn't turn on when we approached, but we both had torches and a small wind-up lamp that had some power to it.

We waited for what felt like hours as we sat at the bus stop, and eventually, to what felt like our luck, the light lit up.

""Something is definitely here,"" Lily said, and as I looked at her, she held two fingers against her left eyebrow, as if there was tension there.

""Ehh, hello?"" A voice said from the left of us. I look over, and a young man, maybe 19, was standing there with a large bag and a puffer jacket. Shit, it wasn't waiting for anyone; it was waiting for people running away.

""Hey bud, how are you?"" I said in the friendliest tone I could, which I now realise would've been extremely unnerving considering the circumstances. I was only a few years older than this guy, and I tried to seem as natural as possible.

""I'm… good,"" the runaway said whilst still standing a few metres away.

""Elijah, heads up,"" Lily said silently after she placed a hand on my shoulder. I looked up at her, and she nodded her head towards the distance where two headlights shone towards us.

""So what brings you out of town? Going on a trip?"" I said as naturally as I could. Lily later told me that I weirded even her out.

""N-no… I just need to get out of this town, y'know,"" he said after a long moment.

The bus passed me and Lily and stopped directly in front of the runaway. This thing really had a target, but we both jogged over to the runaway and lined up behind him. The runaway was the first to enter, and after he stepped on, the door tried to shut but stopped midway through before slowly opening again, almost like it was reluctant to let us on.

We stepped up the steep metallic steps, and I tried to get a look at the bus driver, but from all I could see in the very dark bus was that he wore a typical bus driver uniform and sunglasses. He made no moves to greet or even acknowledge us. Lily was behind me, and after walking slowly down the aisle, I sat on the middle left-hand side of the bus, a few seats down from the runaway, and Lily sat across from me.

Besides our already established caution and scepticism, I felt like this place was really off. The bus was humid, and a sour smell hung in the air; it smelt almost like meat, but I couldn't place what animal.

The bus's engine came to life slowly, and it began to wheel down the lone country road towards \[REDACTED\].

""Elijah, stay focused; we need to take notes on what this thing is,"" Lily said before taking out her notebook and writing some notes. I reached into my bag and grabbed my camcorder.

The camcorder struggled to turn on. I now know that paranormal events and entities create a type of dead zone for technology or at the very least interfere with it greatly.

I was too distracted by the camcorder to realise that it was approaching until it grabbed hold of my shoulder. The bus driver held onto me, and I felt its fingers sink into me.

I looked up and saw its face staring down at me. Well, I looked at where its face should be; what was there was nothing. I need to stress that it wasn't flat like a smooth option; I mean, there was a hole where its face should be, and inside was a void.

""FUCK,"" I screamed. ""LILY,"" I continued, and as I looked at her, I realised she had her fingers on her forehead. She looked like she was in pain but was focused. I put my left hand on the bus driver's hand, trying to shift it off, and with my other hand I dig into my bag, looking for something.

I pulled out a small plastic bag filled with small white crystals. I opened the bag with my right hand and pushed it into the bus driver, which caused it to flinch back in pain and let go of my shoulder. Silver halide, or ""silver salt"", is like kryptonite to most paranormal creatures.

The creature made a hissing noise and fell back into a chair. I jumped out of the chair, and the adrenaline propelled me towards the driver's seat to try and pull the brakes, but it wouldn't budge.

I looked back towards the back half of the bus, and I noticed the hitchhiker; she was clearly dead. Her eyes were white and milky, and her skin was pale and thin.

""How did it get to him so quick?"" I thought, and I quickly looked back at the bus driver, and it stood up out of the chair and shrieked at me. It was next to Lily but completely ignored her, which meant I was in danger, real danger.

This was the moment that I realised what type of work I was in; it wasn't just going to sites and checking urban myths, it was standing in front of things that shouldn't exist and just trying to survive.

It leapt at me, and I shielded my arms out in front of me. I heard a metallic slam, and I opened my eyes to see it wriggling on the floor. I looked over at Lily and saw her hand outstretched towards the creature, and her eyes were rolled back.

""ELIJAH, USE THE RUNESTONE."" She yelled at me before throwing a cloth sack at me. I nodded my head and reached into the sack and grabbed a small stone pebble that had a rune etched into it. I had always been good with the study of languages, so when I saw the rune etched into the stone, I remembered what the intent was. I slammed it against the bus door and shouted “útlagr!”, an old Norse word meaning “banish”. When said with intent with this runestone, you can temporarily banish things not from our plane.

As I said this, my surroundings suddenly turned to mist, and I fell hard on some gravel. I had rolled for a few feet and was convinced that I had broken my shoulder; I held onto it and groaned. I looked around and saw Lily a few feet away.

""You okay?"" she asked. She held onto her ankle, and when I looked down at it, I realised that it must've twisted in an unnatural way.

""I'm fine. What the hell was that?"" I asked in between shallow breaths.

""A Lophiiformes-type entity. You're lucky; this was one hell of a first case, rookie,"" she said before laying back and breathing hard. What she did on the bus took a lot out of her, and she was close to passing out completely.





I called in to our higher-ups, and they dispatched some backup. A few hours before dawn, we had six people on the site surveying the bus stop. Before long, it was exorcised, and all that stands there now is a bus bench along an old country road.

I got chewed out for using a runestone. For those who don't know, runestones are incredibly rare; almost all of them can be traced back to an incredibly powerful witch in eighth-century Norway who created a couple thousand. How Lily was able to get her hands on one is beyond me, but without it, I'm convinced we'd be dead.

Lily got chewed out for putting us in that situation; her relationship with the organisation is different from mine. For them, I am an employee, but for her, it's a lot stricter. She wasn't fired and was allocated to the role of my partner indefinitely, which still stands today.

For those of you still reading, I thank you. You might be wondering why I am writing this and why I am interested in publicising some of my work if it means it would be censored. Simple.

After about 2 months the coolant light came on and the over flow reservoir read below the normal range. Took it for an oil change; dealer checked completed a pressure test and topped off the reservoir no problem noted. 

Coolant light came back on approaching a month ago it also happened to be time for the next oil change. Noted to service the coolant light came on and oil change was completed. Service noted that VW recommended a head gasket replacement and to check the head for warping. Head gasket job completed. 

Week goes by after picking up the vehicle, oil pressure light comes on. Personally check to see if there's oil. Oil present and in the normal zone on the dip stick. Climbed under the car and oil plug present. Car sat overnight until the next morning, drove the car back to the dealer no issues until the car went into limp mode. Dash noted no rpms over 4000 about 5 miles out from the dealer. Returned the car back to the dealer noted the issue. 2 days later. ""Hey sir you need a new engine good news is that its only going to coat you $50 for the deductible also the oil pan is completely filled with metal shavings. Me ""Make sure you put my original oil from the oil change in a coffee can I payed for that 😆"" 

Only thing I can assume is that a tech dropped something  in the engine when the head gasket was being replaced and it went south.

Ever wake up feeling like you're auditioning for the Tin Man in *The Wizard of Oz*? I know I have! That first stretch of the morning can be... an experience, right? Especially after 50. We all start creaking a little more. So, I've been experimenting lately, trying to figure out the best way to keep my body feeling good and mobile as I navigate retirement life.

My question to you is: stretching or gentle yoga? Which one is the real winner?

For the past two weeks, I've been giving both a shot, and honestly, the results have been pretty interesting. Here's what I've noticed:

*   **Stretching:** Super convenient! I can literally do it anywhere. Waiting for my coffee to brew? Time for some hamstring stretches! Watching TV? Calf stretches, here I come! It's great for targeting specific areas that are feeling tight. But… sometimes it feels a bit... boring? Anyone else feel that way?

*   **Gentle Yoga:** More of a full-body experience. I love the mindfulness aspect of it; it's not just about the stretching, but also about the breathing and being present in my body. Plus, there are tons of free videos online!

So, what's better? Well, it really depends, doesn't it?

Think about it:

*   **Time commitment:** Got 10 minutes? Stretching is your friend. Want a longer, more immersive practice? Yoga might be the ticket.
*   **Your body's needs:** Feeling a specific kink in your shoulder? Targeted stretching could be ideal. Need an overall reset? Gentle yoga might be more beneficial.
*   **Your personality:** Do you thrive on routine and discipline? Or do you prefer something more fluid and engaging?

Personally, I found that alternating between the two works best for me. Some days I need a quick stretch to loosen up, and other days I crave the more holistic experience of yoga. I even got my grandkids to join in, which is always hilarious and heartwarming!

Speaking of getting started, finding the right resources is key. After a lot of research and testing, I found this great freebie guide that could help jumpstart your journey whether you prefer stretching or yoga. ""We believe in strongest people."" So, check it out here: https://liveitupdeals-hub.github.io/online-yoga-and-at-home-workouts

Ultimately, the goal is to keep moving and grooving, right? To be able to chase after the grandkids, tend to the garden, or just enjoy a pain-free walk.

What about you? Are you a stretching fanatic, a yoga devotee, or something else entirely? What works for you to stay flexible and active as you embrace the retirement life? I’m curious to hear your thoughts!",1,1761100559.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

1ocwil7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ocwil7/aita_for_calling_this_woman_out/,AITA for calling this woman out?,"So, I (19M) go to this local coffee shop a lot. It's kind of a chill community spot where people go to chat, read, work, or just vibe. They sell both coffee and tea, and surprisingly, a lot of young adults hang around there. There's also this book discussion group that meets there every so often, mostly women around my age. I don't usually join in, but I know the organizer, play, let's call her Jessica, and I've read a few of the books they discuss.

The other day, I went as usual, and there was this new girl(who got there earlier) sitting outside with a copy of Never Lie by Freida McFadden, which I've read. She looked up from the book and looked at me, so I figured I'd say hi. I like talking to people there, that's kind of the whole reason I go.

I asked her how the book was, and she gave me a vague answer, ""It's decently good."" I asked what it was about, and she couldn't really say. For context, the book's about a psychologist and they're selling author, Dr. Hale, who ends up doing some pretty wild stuff, kidnapping, drugging, murder, etc. She didn't mention any of that or even know the characters' names.

So I kinda joked and said, ""Did you actually read it?"" and she admitted, ""No, I didn't"". Then I said, ""Oh, so you're being performative."" She got a little defensive and said, ""Well, I wouldn't go that far"". I could tell she was getting annoyed, so I changed the subject.

A few minutes later, her book group started showing up. Jessica asked if I wanted to join since I read the book, and I said Sure. The new girl, let's call her Alyssa, stayed for the discussion. Everyone was asking questions, and sharing thoughts, and what Alyssa did was just repeat what the second-to-last person said word for word, bar for bar. And when it came around to me, I asked, ""Who's everyone's favorite character that got killed off?""

Alyssa, who was right next to me and had to say her opinion first, she froze. She clearly couldn't name anyone after if she had awkward seconds, she kinda snapped and said ""Fine, I didn't read the book, fuck"". And called me a dick for ""trying to patronize"" her. Then she stormed off.

Everyone else just looked confused. I said, ""She must have been having a bad day"". And then the conversation moved on.  Now I'm wondering if I was the asshole here. I didn't mean to embarrass her. I honestly thought everyone knew she hadn't read it, and I was just curious if she'd admit it.

I know that this is a very subjective question, but I want to learn from your experiences.

I worked for about 6 months in Australia remotely, specifically in Byron Bay and Melbourne. What I really enjoyed about Australia is the community aspect, because of all the working holiday visa holders that Oz has. This is what I learned I value the most, being around people that also work but enjoy the free time together, going to coffee shops, hikes, chill, doing some sports, etc. The bad side is that it is not cheap at all. 

Of course, there are the usual digital nomad spots like Bali in Indonesia or Da Nang in Vietnam. But I’m not sure how strong the community really is there. Do people genuinely connect and support each other, or is it more influencers and yoga teachers? I haven’t been myself, so I know that stereotype is probably unfair, but it’s what I’ve heard.

I did a month-long trip to Japan, and I loved it. But of course, I guess I fell in love as a tourist, not as a local. Either way, I'm considering it for a place to stay for a while. The downside is, from what I read, that it is pretty hard to meet new people, and it can get pretty lonely.

I was also considering Busan in South Korea, which seems like a cool place.

1ocwgdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ocwgdk/me_41mthats_it_see_post/,Me (41M)…that’s it. See post 🫠,"Hi Reddit…got a bit of a conundrum here and now sure where to go for advice. I’m a bit bereft of people to lend an ear these days, so I guess this is my last option.

Backstory - I’m a 41 year old man, single, no kids. I got divorced in 2020, spent the last 5 years rebuilding life, moved across the country for a job away from all my friends and family during that time. I’ve been in my new city for about 3 years now. I haven’t made any friends at all. I don’t know how…I’m pretty introverted for the most part, the friends I did have back home were lifelong friends, I haven’t made a new “friend” since high school haha.

I work a lot, and I do pretty well for myself. I just bought a house and settled in for the long haul. I like being physically active…when I’m firing on all cylinders. I’ve been very “blah” over the past few years. The wheels haven’t fallen completely off, but I need to get back in shape to my standard (former marathon runner).

While we are on the subject of mental health, I’ve had struggles with depression, and I do have issues with anxiety. I try to keep that under wraps, and again, I do ok with managing all that for the most part. I don’t drink or have any other destructive tendencies…not because of a sobriety thing, I just don’t particularly care for it—had my party days in my youth, by the time I was in my mid twenties I was over it.

Outside of participating in physical activities like running, I’m a bit of a home body. I participate in mostly solo activities. Right now it’s mostly house projects. Just built a pretty legit home theater, working on a coffee bar, installed some new floors, painted, etc. when I do run I like running solo and listening to music. I have a 1 year old German shepherd that I try to keep up with. She’s great 😊. I guess my only other hobby to speak of would be home espresso brewing (trust me, it’s a thing…), and shooting (no judgement please, not wanting to turn this in to a political post, thanks).

Some days I don’t shut up, but then I can go days at a time without wanting to talk. Social battery drains easily. I have to be “on” at work all the time, so when I get home I just want peace…and in the morning I also want peace in order to center myself for the day.

Which brings me to dating life…I’m not going to complain about online dating, that’s a whole other conversation. When it comes to relationships, I know I want to be with someone, but it’s difficult because I really enjoy all of my alone time and I don’t know how to reconcile that. I feel like when I get in to a relationship I sacrifice a lot of myself to be whatever my partner wants me to be, then I become miserable.

I’ve been in an on-again-off-again relationship for three years. I met her as soon as I got down here. She’s a great person, but outside of the physical aspects there isnt a lot of compatibility for me…different interests, lifestyles, etc. I also felt like I was being put in to a situation where I was essentially taking care of her, if you know what I mean. I don’t really want to sign up for anything like that either.

but it’s also a bit of a weird thing to “meet” someone as an adult and enter in to a relationship.

In my head I feel like there needs to be a purpose for a relationship other than just finding someone to be an emergency contact or to find your corpse one morning. I don’t want kids, I don’t necessarily want to raise kids (wouldn’t be opposed meeting someone who has kids but I’m not looking to be a full time stepdad). When you’re not starting a family or marrying your high school sweetheart and building a life from scratch, what the heck do you base a relationship on?

I’m not antisocial. I’m on the spectrum, I’m a little awkward, yes,  but my logic brain keeps telling me the relationship I’m in needs to be ABOUT something or have a destination. It can’t just be all about the physical, but I don’t know what I “need” from it? Maybe I need someone to have conversations like this with? My head is very overactive with lots of things always swirling around that sometimes I need help sorting out. Yes, a therapist helps, and while I have gone that route in my life, sometimes what you need is a friend or significant other who doesn’t need a copay.

This turned in to a bit of a word vomit and I feel like I’m rambling haha. Guess I’ll cut it off here and see what kind of responses I get, if any.

TL;DR I’m content to be alone, I just don’t necessarily want to be. I want to make friends, platonically, and I want to find my soulmate, I just don’t know how to do that from a practical and psychological standpoint.

3. Some subtle color enhancements to the red and golds without oversaturation would be great.  
4. For her face,  some light skin tone smoothing and brightness adjustment to bring warmth to her expression.
5. Maybe contrast corrections to bring definition and details back to her face and clothing?
Please try to enhance clarity around her eyes and smile slightly for emotional focus... this is where people will be looking the most.  
6. Center and straighten the frame for symmetry, and crop slightly to reduce top empty space.

For context, running on Steam on desktop PC, mid-high end specs (5800x cpu, 7800 xt gpu, 32 gigs ram). I did not watch *any* of the trailer content, but I have played through the original Bloodlines about 50 times since 2004. I paid for the Super Deluxe $TooMuchMoney edition sight unseen, with 0 hesitation. Does this make me a sucker? Maybe. But since 2006 I have loudly told people this game deserves a sequel, and it would be hypocritical of me not to fork over my dollerydoos at the first opportunity.

Without going into spoilers, I can tell you:

The good - the atmosphere is pretty much spot on, the music is great, many of the characters are excellent, the dialogue is pretty good, some of the voice acting so far is outstanding (i kind of love Pandora), the story is compelling so far, the intrigue feels like a good VtM campaign.

The middling - I am not the biggest fan of the choices the VA for Fabien made, but that's kind of personal preference. The combat is kind of fucky, but that's kind of expected. Most pen and paper games of VtM aren't necessarily very smooth, combatwise either. The Haven doesn't feel like a home yet, but hey it's only been 4.5 hours. Music kicks in at odd times, which feels a bit off putting. You can only listen to Bet of Night in your Haven lobby - which is a shame, I would like my Phyre to enjoy some late night talk radio in her Haven. MORE CLOTHING CHOICES PLEASE.

The bad - it has crashed 4 times in 4 hours. None at all during the last 2, but its pretty janky. I have put a few hundred hours into Cyberpunk 2077 so that is not about to stop me. It does not make the game unplayable, but I would be remiss not to mention it. The textures on some of the background items are excessively simple, while some foreground graphics (like NPC clothing) are needlessly complex. Sometimes I can feel the game hang between transition sequences that I fear will cause a crash, so I freeze and refuse to move the mouse or enter keystrokes until I feel confident the game is going to play nice. The map function feels dated - a bit like a game from 2012. It is functional, but a bit meh. 

The Uncertain - the game is technically ""open world"" I guess, but much the same way the downtown LA of the original Bloodlines was open world. You can feel and sense the edges of the map, and you can get the idea ""ok, over the course of the next XX hours I will explore all of this."" That's not necessarily a bad thing. Mass Effect Andromeda was TOO open to the point of feeling empty and underdeveloped. I dont know what to make of how they've implemented blood resonance. It feels a bit like an afterthought right now. I would like the option to ""do"" more stuff in the Haven. As I mentioned, I sank too many hours into Cyberpunk 2077, and that game handled V's apartments really well. They feel lived in, with little nothing tasks and things to do (press E to make coffee/play guitar/turn on radio/shoot pool). So far, VtM:B2 only has the jukebox - and only if you got the DLC. 

In conclusion: it's fucking good. I read someone online (possibly on this subreddit!) call it good, but not Bloodlines 2. Hard disagree. This feels exactly like when I played Bloodlines for the first time (right down to the crashes). This is absolutely a worthy successor. It's not GTA. It's not Bloodborne. It's not Ghost of Tsushima. It's not Doom. It's kind of unique.

Right now, I feel pretty great about Paradox owning the White Wolf properties, and am prepared to continue giving them All Of My Money (do not ask how many CK2/3 & HOI L4 DLC I own).

Should you buy it? Absolutely. Do not wait for a sale if you can afford to buy it now, and can run it on desktop. I feel like just being online you risk spoilers and the story and characters are so interesting and so compelling, it might be a shame if it gets spoiled for you.

Is it perfect? No. Is it pretty fucking good? Yes. Can it get perfect? Maybe. Do I expect DLC to add more content and fix shit? Yes. I have sunk the amount of time into Cyberpunk that I have because of the commitment CDPR put into adding content, and it would be nice, but perhaps hoping too much for Paradox to do the same here.",3,1761099828.0,vtmb,7,0.58,False
1ocw8w1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimatePreparation/comments/1ocw8w1/how_do_decreasing_food_prices_fit_in_a_world/,How do decreasing food prices fit in a world worsening climate change?,"So I've been following food prices recently, as when shopping at my local, I've noticed steep increases in some foods but *decreases* in others. This has led me on another research rabbit run to see if it's climate-related, and why these decreases are happening if we believe that climate change should be rising prices.

Take Rice for example. In the fall of 2024, I remember the prices of rice being £19 for a 10kg bag. Fast forward to now, 10kg is around £12. This was super intriguing because I had been stockpiling huge amounts of rice last fall, and my ""value for money fetish"" was tingling at the thought of missing out on savings by buying early. What was happening?

Then I saw the price of pepper in one of my food shops, and I had to blink twice. It had gone up drastically. Other foods such as chocolate were, as we are probably used to, sky high. Coffee. Orange Juice. Etc.

So I checked out [`https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/`](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/)

Now, the obvious trend in many of these is COVID 2020 and the 2022 energy crisis. Those events disrupted logistics, fuel, and energy, causing massive increases. However, fuel prices stabilized around mid-2023. One would expect food prices across the board to reduce in-line, and for the most part, this has been the case for some big staples.

So what is going on with the recent *divergence*?

I tentatively point to human behavior. Take rice again: the stubbornly high price in 2024 (driven heavily by factors like India's export ban to protect its own supply) caused many farmers globally to switch to this crop, chasing profits. Simultaneously, high prices probably changed some consumer habits. High supply and lower demand this year = price crash.

But what about the others? This is where it gets interesting. Those spikes aren't random. Cocoa prices are astronomical because of a devastating mix of disease and extreme weather (droughts and heavy rains) in West Africa. Orange Juice is sky-high thanks to 'citrus greening' disease and recurring hurricanes decimating Florida's groves. Robusta coffee spiked after a severe drought in Vietnam.

What does this say about climate change?

Well, we are economic-led beings. As the climate becomes less stable, I reason that food prices won't just *rise*, they'll become radically *volatile*. It's a game of 'whack-a-mole,' but the moles are regional climate disasters and the hammer is our collective economic response.

A regional climate disaster (drought in Vietnam) hits one crop. The price spikes. That's the *mole*.

Our response (farmers planting more coffee to chase profits, or consumers switching to tea) is the *hammer*. But planting these crops means other crops are forgone, either raising *their* prices or reducing their surplus, causing a *new mole to pop up elsewhere*.

So all in all, if I am correct here, the future of food prices isn't a simple line going up. It's a battle of market forces vs. increasingly difficult farming conditions.

We've 'whacked' the rice mole for now, and I'm sure pepper, cocoa, and OJ will *eventually* come down in price, too, as supply finally responds (or demand is destroyed). But the real question is: what foods are next, and how much faster will the moles come?

And to think, pre-2020, we had decades of not having to play this game at all. This new era of volatility, this constant 'whack-a-mole' game, doesn't bode well for the future of our food markets.",2,1761099691.0,ClimatePreparation,0,1.0,False

Human CONNECTION through new channels too - the whale / dolphin / ARC connection I heard about today on a podcast blew my mind.

My big comeback Only Fans drop for October 16th was immediately BANNED. I clearly have some unusual stuff going on that I have to address, so I like to talk about it . perhaps someone else here is going through the same thing and can't find any relatable content because NOONE would talk about this stuff except me 😂.

Like I said , this is the place for people who are just ""too much""

All the OF material is consensual and legal of course, just the way I shot it ,I guess implied something too close to the edge of what they permit.. But it's all fictional. just too risqué

""Stephen, thats too much"" is something I tend to hear IRL too tho 🙃

I LOVE YOU

**Video Says: In today's video...**

My darkness, and the shadow self is very linked with the sexual side of my nature. In intimate relationships, I tend to like s...it's quite dark and quite shadow energy I use in that, and it's...y'know...well one thing I've realized since splitting with my ex and having different partners is...people seem to be re...into that. It's the same energy that comes out on OF, y'know, it's the same thing. What I put out on OF, that's my...that's where I am in that field of my life. That's...it's pretty dark. It's pretty...it's pretty...intense.

**Title Card: October 21st - 83 DAYS clean and sober. Some weird & uncomfortable stuff coming up**

How are you? I'm doing alright today. I am kind of a little overwhelmed with recovery, but Y'know. It's all for the greater good. I mean I'm doing so many things. 

This is my step...step work. 

Um. It's just...a lot of...a lot of writing. A lot of facing uncomfortable truths. A lot of...I'm on Step 8 now. Which is um...I know I've gone through it quickly but I tend to do that. I'm going through it quickly because I feel like my life depends on it, honestly. If I don't do this, I'm guna go out again...I'm guna relapse again. So I've made my life's #1 thing for the last 82 days, just...recovery. Getting through these steps. Doing the work. And I know that once I get to Step 12, I can pick my life up again, y'know?

But...it's hard sometimes when you...I feel like I'm just talking and writing about my life and like...it's hard to break off from intense step work and just relax. I can't do that. And uh...so I go to music and music's been great. I've been doing a lot of that. And uh, I have the focus and defocus tracks...I'm a perfectionist so they have to be right. 

I'm thinking about maybe adding some like...guided aspect to the next drop. What do you think about that? Y'know like a guided meditation but not like...you would...not like you know it. More like...in terms of um...just to enhance the experience and have this left and right thing which is what bina...binaural means. I feel like I could accentuate that with some spoken word. I feel like it would draw your brains activity to the left and right more emphatically if there was some spoken word aspect. So I've been experimenting with that. I feel like it's really good but maybe I'll just...I'll see what you think. 

It's definitely an added intensity when you've got someone speaking to you in your ear. But it's me...so I don't know...hearing myself is odd, but you may like it more. Y'know. So. Maybe I'll experiment with that and drop a couple of those. 

I'm very excited about the new person coming back into the fold with the arc work stuff. I think it's guna make so much difference then I can just focus on the arc side and someone else can run everything else. But I'm under strict instructions to stay sober and do a proper Step 9 with that person before they're guna probably y'know...trust me enough to....to come back. It's a...it's a lot of responsibility. There's a lot of you guys out there that want and need us right now. There's a lot of despair out there, a lo of people who don't knwo what to do. 

I saw today an article about...they've done some discovery with whale and dolphin song. And dolphins and whales...apparently they communicate at a very very similar frequency level where I am with the arc which is very exciting. And I notice very very big differences in slight shifts in frequency, and apparently that's how they communicate. I had no idea. 

They have these frequencies that they pipe out to one another and like a tiny shift improve...TINY, can make...make a HUGE difference to what they're saying. And they think they might have even been...they might be relaying stories to one another. And emotions. And conversation. And when this AI takeover happens and we get flooded with misinformation, and flooded with...just we don't know what's real and what isn't because we all live in our silos and our phones and we're already there, aren't we. 

By 2028 we're not guna know what's real and what isn't. All the jobs are guna be gone. There's guna be mass calamites, it's guna be a mass shift in humanity. We're not guna know where to derive our value from becasue we won't have professions anymore. It's guna be a universal basic income, and uh we're all guna get a stipend to live on but where's guna be the motivation? Where...how are we guna feel connection That's what I'm always talking about with this. And this is apparerntly how dolphins and whales have connection, it's through sound and it made me feel so good about this whole project. 

Y'know it is...so ancient, and so...interspecies even to communicate with sound, it makes feel really good, and it makes me feel like I'm on the right path. And it's the one thing that I feel...I h...I'm good and bad, as I've said. I'm dealing with this duality right now of my step work. And it's part of the reason that, y'know, I've taken my foot off the gas a little bit with everything else is because I need to discovery who the hell I am right now. And I know my two things...my two north stars. The arc, the sound frequencies. And I don't have to rush it because it's guna be something that we all need eventually and it's starting to happen already, and I don't need to rush it and I don't need to make mistakes. I don't need to put out anything that isn't right. I...I'm guna take my time and make everything perfect, it's guna be the one perfect thing that exists in the world. 

I know that's a lofty thing to say but when all the craziness starts and people are just grasping for meaning, it's guna be a perfect diamond of perfection that is guna bring people meaning in the same way that sonic work connects different species...like I say, dolphins and whales. That was such an amazing thing to realize. I knew about that, and I...I loved the sound of it, but I didn't realize that the frequencies that it's working on are so similar. And it's the only thing that comes close to what we're doing with the arc. 

But I'm not guna rush it and I'm not guna put out anything that isn't right. Um. Especially when I'm trying to relearn who I am. But I do think a collaborator is guna make things...she's guna like crack me into shape in terms of timelines and...real world stuff...and and and then I can...I can concentrate on just the art of it and just the sonics of it, which is what I love and what I'm good at. The big picture stuff is what I'm good at but I'm not good at day to day, I'm not good at the nuts and bolts. You know, you've seen me completely chaotically barge through very many different attempts to get this on a...level where I can give it to people and just fail because of my chaotic nature. My drug use...or my...just the way I am. I'm a...I'm purely an artist, and terrible at everything else, and that's guna stop this working if it's just me, so I have to have someone that's really good with everything else and that's this person so I'm excited about that. 

We are guna need this...I'm starting to see it. When you don't know what's real, and you don't know...who's real, and you don't have...and you, you're...on your silo just looking at your device...or maybe it's a neuralink, I duno. But in 2028, no jobs, all silo'd into our individual pods or whatever. It's guna happen, it's guna happen. I guarantee you it's guna happen. And then how do we find connection? And that's what my whole life's work is about. That's what the arc is about. And that's what all of this is about, and that's why I'm not rushing it, and I'm guna make it perfect. And it's close, y'know. It's close. 

I also posted on instagram today about how you know I have to...my sexuality, sorry that's a bit of a jump...but I've noticed that...my darkness, and the shadow self is very linked with the sexual side of my nature. In intimate relationships, I tend to like s...it's quite dark and quite shadow energy I use in that, and it's...y'know...well one thing I've realized since splitting with my ex and having different partners is...people seem to be re...into that. And I was loving it, and my partners were...super into it. It's the same energy that comes out on OF, y'know, it's the same thing. What I put out on OF, that's my...that's where I am in that field of my life. That's...it's pretty dark. It's pretty...it's pretty...intense...energy...but it's fun. But I can't touch it now, because it's too close to using drugs. It's too close. It's too close to danger for me. It's too close, I can't go near it. I'm scared of it a little bit. 

So that's another reason I've stopped dating...I mean...that was a big jump but I'm really having confusion around that right now, cuz there's a lots of people I would like to invite out for a drink or something...not a drink...but y'know a coffee or whatever, but I don't want to ruin their lives, and I will because it's so dark what I have inside around sexual energy, so, such a...**(burps)**...pardon me. It's such a dark...ness around that for me right now, and maybe it's in my head, but it isn't in my head. But I also need to work on,..I need to work on that, I need to go to SLAA probably. I need to really dig into that as well, so. 

Sorry it's a bit of a pinball w...thought drop for you today, but sometimes that's where I am. Um. I love you. 

Uh. Anyone else relate to that thing about having darkness around their sexuality, which is you're...it can be quite dangerous when you're trying to be sober and adjust the good you. But I've said it before, I'm good and bad. It's just annoying that the bad is where that stuff lives right now. All completely consensually. Never...y'know...I've talked about it. I made a couple videos about this when I was high. I don't black out when I'm high, I remember everything. And I'm embarrassed by it. But I'm not embarrassed about those videos because they're really true. Those ones I talked about duality...sexually dark...when...in that area, I talked about it a couple of high videos were about that. But like...a lot of the things I said when I was high, they had some semblance in reality. I just said it wrong. 

And now I'm sober and I'm saying things all over the place and jumbly. But hopefully you get it. I wana post a video today cuz I wana stay connected. And, I love you. 

So. Let me know your thoughts about this. 

See you soon.

1ocw125,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1ocw125/i_lost_my_mom_to_a_stroke/,I lost my mom to a stroke,"My mom 9 days shy of her 65th birthday in March 2025, had a stroke on the stairs of our home and died in my arms. I was asleep on the couch after getting home from taking my gf to the ER the previous night. My mom woke up came down and started her normal morning routine. Cig, make coffee, cig, get coffee, cig with coffee, bathroom. Woke me up in the process which made me ask how she felt. She said fine I'm gonna go to the bathroom. She had just had a 90% blockage cleared 5 days prior to this morning. I said okay and laid back down and closed my eyes. 5 seconds later she yells my name and says I need to go to the hospital. I jump up ask what's up and I could see her left leg stopped working as she braces against the walls of the stairs with the right side of her body. She was concerned about shitting her pants so she wanted me to carry her upstairs. My gf was drugged up from the ER trip asleep so I yelled to her to call my sister and she apparently never saved her number so she couldn't. 4yrs. My mom weighed more than me and was completely unaware of her body movements and was very stiff. But I got her up and laid her on her left side. At this point her entire left side is not functioning. I then call 911 and it all hit trying to say what was happening. Gained my composure and gave my gf my sister's number and I called her on her phone while talking to 911 on mine. I lay the phones down and just sat with my mom while she tried to talk and ask for water or her inhaler. I could see the fear. A fear I've never seen before. I could hear her voice trying to remain calm knowing it wasn't going good. I get up run around and grab the things she wanted to calm her. Then I held her head and told her I loved her. After that I yelled for a pillow so I could run out and check for the ambulance. Came back and just laid with her and talked to her but she couldn't respond anymore and was just staring at her numb arm poking it. 1,2,3.1,2,3.1,2,3.1,2,3 I said it's gonna be okay mom!! I love you so fucking much just stay with me please!!! And then she started snoring. Like she had just been completely knocked out. And I knew that was it. I knew she was gonna die right there. I told my gf to go check for the ambulance and nothing. So I just sat there. Then called my sister again. And I don't remember that conversation. But it was quick. 5 minutes later the ambulance shows up and she was silent. I held her head sliding head first belly down like a kid as they carried her by hand down the stairs so he head didn't bounce. They ran her to the ambulance and left. My gf went back to sleep. My sister showed up and we ran to the hospital. They informed us they put her on life support and that she was fully brain dead and would die immediately after being taken off support. We then have to inform everyone. A bunch of people show up within the hour. My gf finally shows up 3 hours later. I broke up with her 2 weeks later after her car got repoed. I can't get the images and sounds from this day to not hurt. Some times I can't get them to stop replaying over and over again. Some times I can say hey I'm lucky I was there for her in that moment and snap out of it. I loved my mom so much. I moved in with her after she had a bad break up when should could afford life on her own. Life then changed drastically for me. I don't know how to deal with everything. The visions, loss of sleep, I don't eat, bad decision making, memory is gone, energy is gone. I've started moving again recently. But fuck man. 

There's a lot more to this story after this that has made this grief process unbearable. Heartbreak, family fights, loss of trust, work problems, money problems, worried about being homeless. Ya know the normal shit. I may continue in the comments. Just didn't wanna type out 7 months of trauma right now.

1ocvw35,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ocvw35,Begin Japanology Vending Machines Se5 Ep38,"In this episode, Peter discusses the popularity and importance of vending machines in Japan, which probably has the most in the world.  Stuff where it can keep hot and cold drinks all year round, in the same machine.  To those that use very little electricity, or using solar energy to power itself and even dispense drinks in a natural disaster for free.  Even some with a defibrillator, in case of an emergency.  And not just drinks, but some items in daily use.

I was in Japan and can say they have a LOT of vending machines.  It's only a little exaggeration, to say on every street corner.  Depending on the popularity of the thoroughfare, I can definitely say it feels like there are, however.  Apparently, Tommy Lee Jones was the face of BOSS coffee, along with Takeshi Kitano at the time.  Those two faces were every where.

I did not see any of the umbrella, book or normal food machines.  And I definitely did not see the one that can tell your sex and age, recommending what others of your bracket are drinking.  Maybe they are only at select locations.

I did see one, that you could play a mini game on the screen, however, about recycling, if I recall correctly.  Like throwing your empty drink container into a bin.  And they do have their recycling bins built into the machine or sitting right next to it.  Japan is a very clean country.

However, I did see ""used"" panty vending machines.  I had heard about them and although I wouldn't call it a ""vending machine"", they did in fact have them in toy capsule like machines.  They were in front of a sex shop out in the open for anyone to buy.

My first and only hot food vending machine, I saw back in the military on base in the US.  I only saw one in the general barracks area, not even where I was staying.  Just discovered it, as I was walking to the chow hall from an other than normal route.  It served very steamy hot cheese burgers and french fries.  Not bad for what it was.  

With the ones in Japan, I'd be a little concerned motor oil or a machine part would find it's way into a bowl of machine ramen, however.  They probably do have extreme safety measures, but no one around to verify at the time of purchase and making it.  Maybe I would try a clear broth one.  Enjoy!

Especially for uni and it got to a point where i romanticize it and it helps me drag myself out of bed if i tell myself “hey i know i wanna sleep more but i can stop by the coffee shop before my classes!”

My concerns are what if i need extra energy for an assignment or to wake up in the morning! 
And if i cave in and have a coffee or energy drink once would it hinder my results etc

I know this may sound far fetched but i strongly believe coffee overconsumption may be the cause of my skin issues (redness and dryness) and i really think if i switch my liquids to strictly water and green tea i’ll see an improvement in my overall wellbeing AND skin. They do say diet and water are the best skin care you know?

Did anyone who made the switch notice other improvements? I heard it’s good for when you constantly wanna snack, for your skin and maybe hair, fixing your sleep schedule etc

I’m not saying it’s a miracle cure but compared to my current diet it would be a huge improvement.

Apologies for the long post! I’m kind of excited about starting this journey i’m even buying a thermal mug so i stop buying expensive coffees and just take a homemade tea to university OMG.

1ocvoa4,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1ocvoa4/lonely_but_not_lonely/,Lonely. But Not Lonely?,"Hi Reddit…got a bit of a conundrum here and now sure where to go for advice. I’m a bit bereft of people to lend an ear these days, so I guess this is my last option.

Backstory - I’m a 41 year old man, single, no kids. I got divorced in 2020, spent the last 5 years rebuilding life, moved across the country for a job away from all my friends and family during that time. I’ve been in my new city for about 3 years now. I haven’t made any friends at all. I don’t know how…I’m pretty introverted for the most part, the friends I did have back home were lifelong friends, I haven’t made a new “friend” since high school haha.

I work a lot, and I do pretty well for myself. I just bought a house and settled in for the long haul. I like being physically active…when I’m firing on all cylinders. I’ve been very “blah” over the past few years. The wheels haven’t fallen completely off, but I need to get back in shape to my standard (former marathon runner).

While we are on the subject of mental health, I’ve had struggles with depression, and I do have issues with anxiety. I try to keep that under wraps, and again, I do ok with managing all that for the most part. I don’t drink or have any other destructive tendencies…not because of a sobriety thing, I just don’t particularly care for it—had my party days in my youth, by the time I was in my mid twenties I was over it.

Outside of participating in physical activities like running, I’m a bit of a home body. I participate in mostly solo activities. Right now it’s mostly house projects. Just built a pretty legit home theater, working on a coffee bar, installed some new floors, painted, etc. when I do run I like running solo and listening to music. I have a 1 year old German shepherd that I try to keep up with. She’s great 😊. I guess my only other hobby to speak of would be home espresso brewing (trust me, it’s a thing…), and shooting (no judgement please, not wanting to turn this in to a political post, thanks).

Some days I don’t shut up, but then I can go days at a time without wanting to talk. Social battery drains easily. I have to be “on” at work all the time, so when I get home I just want peace…and in the morning I also want peace in order to center myself for the day.

Which brings me to dating life…I’m not going to complain about online dating, that’s a whole other conversation. When it comes to relationships, I know I want to be with someone, but it’s difficult because I really enjoy all of my alone time and I don’t know how to reconcile that. I feel like when I get in to a relationship I sacrifice a lot of myself to be whatever my partner wants me to be, then I become miserable.

I’ve been in an on-again-off-again relationship for three years. I met her as soon as I got down here. She’s a great person, but outside of the physical aspects there isnt a lot of compatibility for me…different interests, lifestyles, etc. I also felt like I was being put in to a situation where I was essentially taking care of her, if you know what I mean. I don’t really want to sign up for anything like that either.

but it’s also a bit of a weird thing to “meet” someone as an adult and enter in to a relationship.

In my head I feel like there needs to be a purpose for a relationship other than just finding someone to be an emergency contact or to find your corpse one morning. I don’t want kids, I don’t necessarily want to raise kids (wouldn’t be opposed meeting someone who has kids but I’m not looking to be a full time stepdad). When you’re not starting a family or marrying your high school sweetheart and building a life from scratch, what the heck do you base a relationship on? 

I’m not antisocial. I’m on the spectrum, I’m a little awkward, yes,  but my logic brain keeps telling me the relationship I’m in needs to be ABOUT something or have a destination. It can’t just be all about the physical, but I don’t know what I “need” from it? Maybe I need someone to have conversations like this with? My head is very overactive with lots of things always swirling around that sometimes I need help sorting out. Yes, a therapist helps, and while I have gone that route in my life, sometimes what you need is a friend or significant other who doesn’t need a copay.

This turned in to a bit of a word vomit and I feel like I’m rambling haha. Guess I’ll cut it off here and see what kind of responses I get, if any. 

Like I said in the title, I’m content to be alone, I just don’t necessarily want to be. I want to make friends, platonically, and I want to find my soulmate.

Its about a man who is either divorce or widowed or maybe just not in a relationship, who just spend his days lying on his or his friends couch and one day or maybe after some time he kind of has his life back together, he goes to a coffee shop and meets a red headed woman. He and her get along and start dating but when he takes her to his friend's house or maybe before then, we find out she isn't real. So the whole movie is him realizing it till the ending where after hes moved on from that he goes back to the coffee shop and meets her again except this time its the REAL her.

With so many assh\*les and scammers out there, I want to make sure our environment is safe so I appreciate it if you read until the end. Thanks!

Anyway, let's see if we will work out. To set expectations, I'm willing to travel to your location as long as it's not far away than Manila or Quezon City Areas. If you're from Tarlac or Pangasinan, all the better.

For both of our safety: I will be posting a DOWNLOAD link for some of my (SFW) pictures here. Just so you really know what I look like and that you can trust me. So if you still want me based on those pictures, just simply DM me. Don't worry, I will NOT be asking you for nude photos or videos and please don't ask me for those as well. Also, do not worry, I will NOT ghost you or abandon you out of nowhere. A real man MUST ALWAYS be honest and upfront, so expect me to be honest with you rather than leaving you hanging and I expect you to do the same. This is to filter out scammers and frauds out there. I want you and me to be safe and I want us both to enjoy this experience. So safety first!

\- Doesn't have kids (I value my freedom and privacy too much but I'm willing to adopt pets)  
\- Hates ghosting and extremely delayed replies (if you did NOT reply to me within 24-48 hours, then I will consider that as ghosting and I will pursue someone else. I'm sorry.)  
\- Had quiet a number of ex-girlfriends but I no longer have contacts with any of them  
\- Has a LOT of hobbies and may require a lot of away time but I'll always make sure to always remind you that I think of you and spend time with you as best I can  
\- Loves watching Anime, Cartoons, Horror/Psychological Thriller/Slasher/Fantasy (particularly, magical medieval fantasy)/CGI/Superhero movies  
\- Very Fashionable (I always dress to impress in every occasion EXCEPT at home)  
\- Values Healthy Living - I'm on STRICT Carnivore Diet, NEVER smoked since birth, rarely drinks alcohol, lives life stress-free/no drama, hates eating junk foods, processed foods, chips, sugary stuffs, candies, soft drinks, and too much carbs. Oh, and I hate coffee and tea too.

\- Very Organized - I always mark important events in my calendar

\- Certified Dog and Cat-lover (I can't help but pet and play with every dog or cat I see in the streets)

\- Preferably, someone who does NOT smoke, in the process of quitting smoking, or has quit smoking altogether (I HATE the smell of cigarettes)|  
\- Drinking Alcohol is fine as long as you're NOT an alcoholic/addict  
\- Must be willing to really show interest and not waste time (this goes to what I said above. If you can't reply to messages within 24-48 hours, say so instead of staying silent or else that's considered GHOSTING and I'll say my goodbyes to you)  
\- Must NOT be too nonchalant (If you don't really care about getting together and being my date, why are you even here?)  
\- Must not be too sensitive (I love making people laugh so if you're the type to easily get offended, we're NOT gonna get along)  
\- Hopefully, you're also a dog or cat-lover  
\- Hopefully, you also value loyalty  
\- Hopefully, you also have good libido (This is non-negotiable for me. bedroom chemistry is extremely important in a relationship. If you are boring in bed and have low bedroom drive, we're NOT gonna get along)

For anyone interested, feel free to send me DMs any time! I admit this might come off as a job application but that's only because I don't want any scammers or frauds ruining our experience. After all, we want genuine connections at the end of the day. I'll do my best to accommodate you.

First off, they no longer offer 200g bottles and are offerring 50g and 100g ones. I dont mind as it gives me more option to buy bits of them! Im most excited to try Colombia (Logan) and the Bolivia beans. 

It was also my wife’s first time to try Glitch and she has to bring her own coffee as well.

1ocvg6s,https://i.redd.it/54a7qusoikwf1.jpeg,Rating My Collection,"I’m bored, so here we go: 

Nikos Sculpture - 6.5/10 - decent white floral, sweet, freshie. Doesn’t last too long and is inoffensive

Micheal Kohrs Extreme Blue - 5/10 - generic blue, doesn’t last very long. Got as a gift and almost never use

Lataffa blue horse thing - 6.2/10 - got it for $13 at marshals, it’s fine, a bit sweet and lasts longer than expected

Prada Luna Rossa Carbon - 8.5/10 - peppery, metallic lavender. Great daily scent, smooths out and enhances that sauvage type DNA, love

Spicebomb Fresh - 8.2/10 - great fresh take on the OG Spicebomb DNA, sad it was discontinued. Only knock is its longevity

Spicebomb Night Vision EDP - 9/10 - Dark horse of the Spicebomb line-up, love the Apple freshness and lasts all day on me

JPG Le Beau Le Parfum - 9.5/10 - dark pineapple and coconut with a hint of iris and woodyness. Lasts on skin all day and I still smell it on clothes days after. Easily a favorite and I cannot sing its praises enough.

Azzaro TMW Parfum - 9.7/10 - best smelling in my collection, so intoxicatingly good. Sweet vanilla woods with great projection and longevity

Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa - 8.8/10 - amazing boozy coffee smell that lasts a good long time, dark and sweet.

Armani Code Absolu - 9.3/10 - my newest bottle, vanilla bomb with that code DNA in the back. Amazing fragrance, damn shame it’s been discontinued

Essential Parfums Bois Imperial - 3/10 - wanted to like this so much - super squeaky and scratchy to my nose, gives me a headache 

John Varvitos Dark Rebel - 7/10 - dark boozy and woody, great smell but doesn’t last long

Tom Ford Oud Wood - 8.3/10 - great dark and mysterious smell. Great longevity, but not my personal cup of tea most days. 

NOT PICTURED:

PDM Oajan decant - 10/10 - best I have ever smelled, like a crazy apple pie. Will be purchasing a bottle as a gift to myself when I get married to keep it as special as it is

LV Meteore decant - 9.7/10 - best freshie I’ve smelled, like peppery laundry sheets. Lasts 10 hours on my skin which is crazy for a freshie. 

Creed Absolu Aventus - 9/10 - purchased a bottle for my father as a gift. Amazing scent that lasts all day, very pineapple and peppery, really loved it

Salvatore Ferigamo EDT - 6/10 - decent freshie, fruity and peppery, doesn’t last very long

OLD THROWAWAYS OR USED UP

Givenchy Pi - 6.8/10 - good old vanilla scent, classic for a reason. Overshadowed by other scents

Tom Ford Champaca Absolute - 2/10 - WOOF I hate this one, smells like old grandma but strong and for a long time

Vince Camuto Eterno - 6.3/10 - decent freshie, doesn’t last long

Tommy Hilfiger Cologne - 5/10 - smells like it you looked up cologne in the dictionary but only for 2 hours 

Drakkar Noir - 10/10 - no explanation needed, GOAT

Royal Copenhagen - ??/10 - smells like my childhood and I can’t put a rating on that

I typically can’t walk well at all and use my chair every time I go out. I just figured I’d slowly make it work. But my walking was actually decent. My foot was actually hitting heel to toe (I usually Frankenstein clop on my tiptoes). I was able to walk to my car and back a couple of times. I walked with hot coffee. I thought maybe the Fampyra I just started taking (three days in) was maybe working for me, and I felt really hopeful. But today I tried walking and it didn’t work out for me. The Frankenstein clop was back, my leg was so spastic (I take baclofen), and I tired so quickly. The only thing I can think of to explain my mobility the other night was that I had been up all day and that’s how long it takes my body to start “working.” Or maybe it’s the Fampyra?

My window was 11 to 2. He called me and let me know he would be there between 11:55 and 12:05. He arrived at 11:59 PM full of smiles,  full of explanations about my car and the process.  Took pic of my ID and proof of insurance.  He got the car off the truck. Went over everything, went over the three different scuffs that were shown in the listing. Then asked me if I wanted to take it for a test drive since he had to get his truck situated anyway. And I did. This process was amazing. I took it for a test drive and it felt great! No lights were coming on. All seemed awesome. But I did notice it was dirty inside. Definitely not really detailed. There’s a paper mat under the driver side, but when I picked it up, the floor mats were filthy. Then I noticed sprayed coffee across the top visor and around the fabric at driver window. (Cream interior). Spilled coffee on the side console of the driver side. So if Carvana really cleans the  cars… I give them a big fat F. They don’t do a very good job at all.  As a matter of fact, the entire steering wheel was very sticky. So was dashboard- very dirty and dusty.  And seats and floors were not in good clean condition.  If you were buying this off a roadside, the personal owner would definitely pay a little more attention to what was going on here. I have an appointment with a Nissan dealership to have it checked out. So far so good mechanics wise. (Got a 2023 SL NISSAN ROGUE).  Complaints-I think that the alignment’s a bit off. Underneath- the tailpipe looks a little rusted out. And we also noticed that the brake pads might need to be changed out when driving around. So far a great experience overall. Delivery guy was awesome. Timing was awesome. Not happy with how dirty but I can deal with that and pay for a good detail. It’s used after all.  Stay tuned for more once I get it inspected at Nissan! Hope this is helpful to first timers like me! ",6,1761097138.0,carvana,2,0.88,False

Single, 31M, no kids. I have an opportunity to move to Birmingham AL from Tampa FL. It would be for a promotion, likely making in the $130-150k/year range. They are pushing hard for me to take this promotion - but I am uncertain because of the area/everything I’ve heard of Birmingham online. I’m considering it heavily because recently I found an enjoyment of hiking and nature and Birmingham seems to offer that. The territory I would be working would have me spending either 3x a week in Birmingham, 1x a week in auburn or Tuscaloosa, and 1x a week in Montgomery(I’ve heard bad things about here). They would recommend I live in Pelham, alabaster, downtown Birmingham, or Hoover. If there are any other good recommendations let me know!

Some things I enjoy:

Hiking, walking, reading, coffee shops, sports, quick/local places to eat. I do not drink.

What is the low-down on this area and for people who have lived or do live around here: what should I expect?

Starting over rarely looks heroic.
Sometimes it’s just pouring a glass of water before the coffee.
Or stepping outside for a few slow breaths when the walls start closing in.

It might be opening my old journal you couldn’t bear to face last week.
You don’t need a master plan.
You just need presence — one small act of choosing yourself again, right here, right now.
That’s where healing begins.

And here’s the truth —
you’re not actually back at the beginning.
You carry something forward every single time you try again.

A little more awareness.
A little more gentleness.
A clearer sense of what hurts and what helps.
You’re wiser now — about your own patterns, your boundaries, your strength.
That’s not regression. It’s evolution.

The world will still whisper that you should be farther along,
doing more, fixing more, proving something.

But sometimes the bravest thing you can do
is pause…
and begin again softly —
without apology,
without rushing.

You don’t have to make up for lost time.
You don’t need to explain why you stopped.
Restarting isn’t weakness.
It’s grace in motion.

Because real change doesn’t happen in one grand leap —
it unfolds through the quiet rhythm of return.

We lose our footing.
We find it again.
We forget what we’ve learned.
And then remember it more deeply.

That’s how transformation takes root —
through return, not perfection.

If you’re restarting right now, take a breath.
You haven’t failed.
You’re simply coming home to yourself
with a little more love than before.
Scary but walking through that door is maybe the best statement of integrity you can make.

I am in such trauma bond and feel so guilty for blocking him and “running away” and being a “female narcissist” and “chaotic” and a “loser that no high quality man will want.”

But I can’t help but wonder if I am the problem and overreacting. No this is not fake- yes I’ve posted before. I just need help right now. 

Here are some highlights:

- He told me his family “kills people,” said an ex was “dead in the Hudson,” and that I’d only learn “the truth” if I married in.
- He said he’d put cinderblocks on my feet and I’d rest peacefully down in a local marsh. 
- He said he’d kill his wife if she cheated and often talked about violence like it was normal.
- He said he has “eyes on me” around town, threatened my reputation, and used lines like “the city is small.”
- He monitored/interrogated my location and got angry when I saw friends (“sketchy,” “up to no good”).
- During one fight he grabbed my neck and raised a fist; later blamed drinking and said he stopped himself. 
- He insulted me (“chaotic,” “unstable”), trashed my family/friends, and threatened to destroy my peace.
- He said he “made me into a princess,” called me a “toad,” and that I wouldn’t be the woman I am today without him.
- He pushed gender roles (I “belong in the kitchen”), got mad if I hung with girlfriends, and tried to isolate me by calling my friends sluts and whores. 
- He talked about future control that I’d have to choose him over my family and that he’d block them from seeing future kids if they did not like or respect him while he pays for our house and the kids food etc. 
- He policed my appearance/posts like calling my bathing suit “trashy,” and wanted me to run outfits by him because I represent his family. 
- He staged dramatic crises like claiming he had cancer when I went on a trip for a yoga retreat that he mocked me for. 
- He called drunk saying he had to “get his gun to kill someone,” then denied it later.
- He also played nice (gifts, coffee, golf, clothing, walks with my dog), which made the push-pull feel like a trauma bond.
- He said his mom thinks I’m a dead-end loser trying to get knocked up to be rich
- He said I will never be a member of a country club or high society and made fun of my studio apartment that I pay $3.2k for myself. 
- He used to make fun of my 1-year-old niece when I showed him pictures saying “what is that thing? Put it in the blender”
- He said if we ever got married then he’d not have a nice thing to say about me. 
- He said he’d never divorce and just kill his wife and doesn’t need a book on “how to get away with murder”
- He said no one will want me because of my age and that it’s weird I’m not married yet 
- He lied and said his dad was in the ICU in order to get me to respond 
- He accused me of cheating and would show up to my apartment unannounced and leave gifts to apologize 
- He told me I was a s*x addict for wanting to be intimate more than 2x a week and he’d watch me with cameras if I did anything like masturbate when he wasn’t home. 

This has made me anxious, nauseous, formed a blinking tic, constant guilt, and pulling away from friends/family to keep the peace.

I have him blocked. But I can’t help but feel like he’s gaslit me saying I’ve run away and given up on what could’ve been true and happy love and now I feel regret but I don’t think I am overreacting for blocking him. ",0,1761096757.0,AmIOverreacting,0,0.33,False

Anyone else feeling a *little* bit like that GIF of the dog surrounded by fire right now? 😅

Seriously though, with AI evolving faster than I can finish my morning coffee, it feels like the ground is constantly shifting beneath our feet. Remember when knowing how to prompt was like unlocking superpowers? Now everyone's a ""prompt engineer.""

So, what's next? Are we destined to become obsolete cogs in the AI machine? I don't think so... but only if we adapt! Think about it:

* AI is getting *better* at doing our jobs. No surprise there.
* But AI *still* needs direction, strategy, and that uniquely human touch.
* The value shifts from *doing* the task to *managing* the process.

It's like, back in the day, knowing how to manually type was a killer skill. Now? It's just assumed. The value is in *what* you type, the strategy behind it, the story you're telling. AI content is the same - the value is in the strategy, the nuance.

So how do we stay ahead? It's all about upskilling, friends! And I don't just mean learning the latest prompt trick. We need to:

* **Dive deeper into strategy:** Think marketing funnels, content pillars, audience engagement. Become the *brains* behind the operation.
* **Sharpen those ""soft skills"":** AI can generate text, but can it build relationships? Can it empathize? That's where *we* come in. Hone your communication, collaboration, and critical thinking skills.
* **Become a data whisperer:** Learn how to analyze data, interpret insights, and use them to refine your AI content strategy.
* **Stay curious!** Keep experimenting, learning, and exploring new tools. Don't be afraid to break things (in a safe sandbox, of course 😉).

I was chatting with a colleague the other day, and we were talking about how overwhelming it all feels. He pointed me to this educational program, and honestly, it's been a game-changer. (You can check it out here if you're interested: [https://whop.com/automateit/automateitpro?a=liveitupdeals](https://whop.com/automateit/automateitpro?a=liveitupdeals) \- figured I'd share since it helped me). It is really helping me get my arms around the direction where AI is going.

Are we all going to become AI strategists overnight? Nope. But even small steps – a new course, a helpful article, a deeper understanding of your audience – can make a huge difference.

What skills are you focusing on right now? What keeps you up at night (besides the existential dread of robots taking over the world, obviously)? Let's chat.

We had a Chick Fil A open last week. I was so excited and we went on the first day so I figured there would be kinks to work out. Ordering was seamless and the owner was even there directing traffic. It was a festive mood and everyone seemed excited. All I ordered was fries and a Cherry Berry Frosted Lemonade. Upon getting home I was moving my straw around and I kept hitting something hard. I stuck a spoon in and fished out a hard, rubbery cap(like) object. Being a fan of flavored coffees I suspect it’s the cap to some sort of syrup pump. In light of it being the first day, I did nothing because I didn’t want to seem like I was fishing for something and I just went about my day trying not to think about what was in my drink and how it got there. I know it could have provided a training opportunity but I just put it down to first day blunders. This happened last Thursday. Today is Tuesday and we went there again for dinner. I ordered the Cherry Berry Frosted Lemonade again amongst with our regular order. Everything went smashing and our order was perfection. Everything right exceeeeept and I swear this is true because I know it’s hard to believe. There was another fecking hard, rubbery cap in my drink.

Now I think my entire 4-year relationship has been a lie.,"It was a lazy, rainy Sunday, the kind where you finally tackle that messy closet you've been avoiding. My boyfriend, Mark, was out with friends, so I put on some music and got to it. Tucked away on the top shelf, behind some old yearbooks, was a dusty shoebox I'd never seen before. Curiosity got the best of me, so I pulled it down, thinking it was just old keepsakes. When I opened it, my stomach dropped. It wasn't old trinkets; it was a photo album, and the first picture was of Mark, beaming, with his arm around a woman I'd never seen, holding a newborn.

My hands started to shake. I told myself there had to be an explanation. Maybe a cousin? An old friend from college? But as I flipped the pages, a whole life I knew nothing about unfolded. There they were, year after year. The baby grew into a toddler, then a little boy. There were pictures of birthday parties with cakes and balloons, family vacations to the beach, Christmas mornings with matching pajamas. It was a complete, documented life of a happy family. His family. And I wasn't in any of it.

When Mark came home, I was just sitting on the couch in the dark, the open album on the coffee table. He saw it and his face went pale. The whole story came tumbling out. He'd been with her for seven years. They had a son. He said he loved me and was going to leave her, but he never knew how. He had been living two entirely separate lives, and I was the 'other woman' without even knowing it. Four years of my life, the future I had planned, it all feels like a giant, elaborate lie.

I feel like I'm in a fog. He's begging me to forgive him, saying I'm the one he truly wants. But how can you ever trust someone who was capable of such a massive deception?

1ocv1mi,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ocv1mi/new_to_this_sober_stuff_my_journey_drying_out/,New to This Sober Stuff - My Journey Drying Out,"Hey everyone - I hope you're all well.

I'm sober right now. I've not really had a drink for about 6 months. This is HUGE for me! It is abnormal, unusual and I am uncertain about it. Here's my short story.

I've always been a big drinker. I'm a 42yo tall guy and built chunky (not hugely obese, just a big set dadbod kinda guy) and I can hold alcohol 'well'. By that I mean that I very rarely blacked-out and did anything I regret, I don't get aggro etc. In my 30's I realised I was day drinking and that I also consumed far more alcohol each day than the average person.  I would say silly things like “I’m really good at drinking” in a sarcastic tone and wonder why certain people who care about me didn’t find that funny. I also noticed I had a routine with little ceremonies, rules and safety checks in place around drinking.  Ways to perpetuate the cycle without people interfering and without me completely falling to pieces.  My ‘holding pattern’ of sorts. This cycle for me looked something like this:

\- Drink… Stop at the bottle shop and buy a bottle of whisky. Go home and start cooking and drinking. Stop drinking at around 1/2 a bottle and at about 11pm on a weeknight. Sometimes I would drink more and stay up later which could lead to bigger problems if I had a bottle or more in an evening. I had to get to a 'the right level' of drunkenness, if that makes sense?... so, I would rarely drink less than about ten standard drinks a night.

\- Sleep terribly…. Wake restless, irritated and worried in the night at about 3am and roll around itching (eczema), sweating and fretting. The ruminating at this hour was awful.  I would overthink everything from simple social interactions that day, to big life events from decades ago.  Anything negative and unsolvable was a worthy topic for my shrivelled late-night mind.  It felt like I was being tortured by my brain and body but in hindsight it was the other way around.  It was common for me to have very negative self-talk at this hour.  “You’re so stupid, doing this all the time…  Why did you drink this much again?...  Don’t drink tomorrow night.  Just have a few days off and you’ll feel better” etc. etc.  The desire to just be restful and sleep was so strong, but most nights were the same.

\- Wake up, hungover… start the day feeling like trash.  This was the norm though so realistically I coped very well. I was rarely physically nauseous but never hungry for breakfast. Sometimes if I had drunk a whole bottle or more, I would throw up in the toilet - just some bile. This was mostly annoying (but also something that caused me shame when I paid it any attention), because it meant I didn't keep down medications and/or would cause me worries about bursting a blood vessel in my eye or something.  That would be something I had to explain to people and was to be avoided at all costs. Most mornings I would drink coffee, get ready and go to work in a blur to 'fake it' out there in the big bad real world.

\- 'Fake it'... Go to work and just make it through.  Get through the social norms, conversations, deadlines, tasks and conversations.  Trudge through the day as an overachieving, hungover, insecure man.  Use self-deprecating humour and joke about drinking too much or “alcohol being the solution to all life’s problems” in conversations with colleagues.  Was this some kind of cry for help? I am not sure.  I would avoid seeing family members who are in medical and caring professions because it felt like they could see through my ‘armour’. I would drink copious amounts of water in a vain attempt to ‘flush it out’ and convince myself I was doing something good for my body.  All the while I would smash my workplace goals and tasks.  I was at the top of my game most of the time or striving gallantly to get there.  Despite the challenges I was causing myself I was a fierce competitor in the career and business games.  I think this might have been effort to feel something good about myself.  Also, a good excuse to drink because work (and life) is ‘so stressful’ and all that…

\- Drink (again)…  All last night’s thoughts of being clean today and having a few days off the grog would be gone by the afternoon.  I would have a tiny little internal battle in the car each day on the way home from work about whether I was going to pull into the bottle shop or not.  I would inevitably ignore the thoughts of being sober and justify why I was buying a bottle.  The excuses were creative and the need to drink was persuasive so I almost always caved-in.  I would often feel (and try to ignore) a sense of shame pulling into my regular retailer.  The staff knew me by name and knew my drinks of choice.  There was sometimes a surprise in their eyes to see me again.  Sometimes I would catch a look of concern or pity in their eyes.  Perhaps I was overthinking it…

So, this was my pattern for many, many years – perhaps 20? I am not sure.

How did it change?  Well, that’s been a real surprise to me too!  Firstly, things went from bad to worse in my life.  That’s the cliché, right?  ‘Rock bottom’.  My two (alcohol related) businesses went through seriously hard financial times before failing completely.  The relationship with one of my friends and business colleagues failed completely (we still don’t talk).  This business catastrophe put massive strain on my relationship with the other director, my best mate since college.  I still fear losing this friendship.  I also fear for his mental health, drug and alcohol misuse but that’s another story.  I had a relationship with a beautiful woman which I sabotaged and ended in those last few months of drinking.  I spent months unemployed and wallowed in deep, dark depression.  I’m no stranger to this, but it was more severe than I like to admit.  I had strong thoughts of suicide and am glad in hindsight for protective factors like the wonderful relationship I have with my teenage daughter, which prevented me from doing anything permanent/unfixable/unforgivable.

A mate of mine who I play online games with started chatting one night about doing a 90-day dry spell, as a challenge between him and a few mates.  This wriggled its way into my brain somehow and became a nagging thought.  I knew it would be hard, but I knew it would be good for me.  Three months off booze would ‘break the cycle’, I thought.  I made an appointment with my doctor, spoke honestly about my situation and got some help. It wasn’t easy.  I walked out drying my eyes, holding a script for some antidepressants, a psychologist referral and a plan to drink less each night over a period of weeks to ween myself off the booze.  Of course, the stubborn idiot in me decided to go cold turkey! Before anyone says anything, I know this is dangerous and I am not encouraging anyone to do the same. Ignoring the advice of doctors isn’t smart but somehow, it’s worked out okay for me.

So here I am, dry as a bone!  The first week was hellish, both physically and mentally.  It does get easier though.  I’ve had a slip up here and there (two nights back-to-back) in the middle there somewhere) but am not beating myself up over it.  I also had a beer over a work dinner a couple of weeks ago and didn’t have the desire to keep drinking. Overall, I am feeling so much better!  I am still finding my feet though.  I don’t really know who I am sober.  What sober me does for fun, who I am friends with, why I am likeable.  I’ve spent so many years heavily drinking that it had become a part of my identity (which is scary to write).  I’m still figuring all that stuff out.  I’m back in the workforce, have my mental health somewhat under control.  I’m working on losing that dadbod and my relationships with family are stronger than they ever have been.

This turned out to be quite a cathartic process for me, writing all this down.  Thank you for reading it.

1ocuvox,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoverPetSitting/comments/1ocuvox/whats_your_most_anxiety_inducing_experience/,What's your most anxiety inducing experience?,"I do mostly house sits. I started a new one on Saturday and I'm here until next Saturday. I am with a tiny independent Yorkie and a pudgy clingy maltese. The maltese never leaves my side, sleeps in the same bed as me, and hangs out with me while I'm doing work throughout the day. The Yorkie is completely on her own and mostly keeps to herself. She is maybe 2 lbs and stands maybe 6 inches off the ground. 

The owner said that I can keep their dog door open pretty much all day and I don't need to monitor them that closely when they go out. They have a huge fenced in yard at their disposal. 

I have been closing the dog door for the night at 9:30 or 10 and I'm usually in bed by 11. I always check to make sure everyone is inside before shutting the door. I am positive the Yorkie was sleeping in a chair in the living room where we were all watching TV before going to bed. 

I woke up this morning, opened the dog door, and started getting their breakfast ready. They are all day grazers, but the last few days food has been an exciting time that usually gets their attention. The maltese was sitting patiently watching me, but no sign of the Yorkie. Whatever, I thought, maybe she went into the owners room last night and is still asleep. 

I was making myself a coffee, and decided to go look for the Yorkie while it brewed. No sign in the owners room, her dog bed in the guest room, or in her little dog house in the hall. She wasn't where I last saw her in the chair in the living room last night, or at her perch by the bay windows in the front room. 

I started to freak and ran out into the yard. It was still early in the morning and the sun was just starting to rise. I paced the whole yard and couldn't find her and then went back inside and double-checked all of her usual spots. Maybe I missed her. Maybe she just blended in with one of the blankets. Nope. Fuck. 

I'm sweating now. Did I accidentally lock her out? Did she find a hole in the fence and sneak away? Did a bird if prey grab her? Did she freeze to death? 

I frantically grab their big jar of treats and start shaking like a crazy person it all over the house and around the yard. I am on my hands and knees checking under chairs, couches, and every bed and bedroom, even the ones that have been closed the whole time. I am *yelling* her name now and debating grabbing my keys and doing a drive around the neighborhood. 

I decide to go into the front room. This is where we spend the majority of the day. The owner has a work station with multiple monitors that I have been using. There is an arm chair next to it. Next to that arm chair is another dog bed that I didn't see before. And who is curled up in the damn dog bed? The little shit Yorkie, still completely asleep. 

I was seriously about to puke. It's over 12 hours later and I still can't believe it. I have to get up every 20 minutes and get a visual confirmation that she is still here. Christ, this gig is going to take years off my life. ",7,1761095759.0,RoverPetSitting,4,1.0,False

My main concern is earlier today I had made a decaf coffee with half and half and some sugar and sugar free syrups and had went to the bathroom came back to my half full cup empty. I had read online that it could cause vomiting but wanted other mom’s opinions on what it could be! If her throwing up continues tomorrow I am taking her into a walk in clinic but am worrying myself with the google answers I’ve been finding.

arrangement, and l'd like some advice on whether or not to go for it.

Here's the backstory: I (27M) met her (25F) on a dating app last December. We went on three dates that I thought went well, but she said she didn't see us going anywhere romantically ""at the moment"". Since then, we've hung out as friends, mostly going to movies or getting coffee, and it's been a lot of fun. We haven't talked about whether either of our feelings have changed.

I recently reactivated my dating profile and noticed her profile now says she's ""looking for hookups or an FWB."" I was surprised by this change and wondered if it's worth bringing up.

To be clear, while we're good friends emotionally, l don't think I have romantic feelings for her anymore. However, I'm still physically attracted to her.

If I bring this up, I'm ready for things to potentially get awkward for a bit. I plan to respect her decision no matter what, even if she's not totally against the idea, but still doesn't think it's a good move. Our friendship is important to me, and I don't want to ruin it based on what happens.

I was very active on this subreddit. I moved so much and went to a very segregated high school where no one wanted to know me or even look at me. I understand this may not help everyone, but it helped me, and I just want to help another person if I can. 

1. **Drop out of self-pity**\-- it is normal to feel sad, but no one will want to be around a person who feels sorry for themselves. Create an attitude to push yourself. I used Pinterest and planned how i wanted to do things, look like, makeup, and clothes. Have an idealised version of you, and work on making that. 

This looks different for all. It can be weightloss or getting back in an activity. Find something that brings you joy even if its looks at inspo tiktoks. 

2. **Find your niche --** If you like Pokémon, find others that do. Your niche knowledge of this will impress other people who are also interested in this thing. If i talk about football to someone who doesn't care, I AMM BOTHERING THEM.

3. **Leave your house--** IF YOU WORK OR ARE IN UNI, GO TO EVERY EVENT

This is really weird and I noticed this so much, people are friendlier out of the regular situation. I made all my friends from seeing them out of the normal place.

4. **Study what the area is on--** 

I wouldn't regularly suggest changing yourself, but for the start, you need a refresh. Find out what works where you are, I used tiktok for this. I looked at what people have where I live, what makes them 'cool' not in an obsessive way but develop yourself from WHAT YOU LIKE in this person and try to replicate it! 

\#I actually went the opposite way and did more so the opposite style of whats popular and then added some popular touches to it idk if that helps?

5. **START TALKING-- Not to everyone not all the time**

its hard to start, but reply to people's stories, like them, talk to them about something they posted. Build a small connection, say hi to them in work or wherever. 

***6. For people that are older.***

***! WORKSHOPS, HIKES, CHATROULLETE*** 

Do any activity you see available, go to those random yoga classes, have a regular coffee shop. Be nice, force yourself to be outgoing, push yourself like you may not have. ALOT of people are going through what you are. Use apps to find similar people. 

  
i have alot more to say idk if this helps, please always text me if you need it. I will always try to be helpful or just have a conversation w you <3 ",2,1761095503.0,lonely,0,0.62,False

Small backyards.  Our county doesn't allow pets owners to let their cats roam unless on their own property. Well for the last two years their cats have been spraying on my things, running our security cameras all day/night requiring us to change batteries constantly. My son is also highly allergic he has an epipen.  We ended up pressure washing our deck, sanding and staining hoping to get rid of urine smell and their cat walked right through the finish as it was drying overnight so now I have cat prints in the finish in which will now need to be redone next summer. 

They were aware we were having a cat issue well the husband was but I guess he never told the wife.  She said her husband is naive and didn't pick up on the social cue I guess. He did know about our stain getting ruined and knew it was his cat. He even went as far as to say well. It's a good thing the cat didn't track the stain inside my house. Never apologized or anything. They are very upset that I filed an animal complaint because animal control showed up at their house and warned to them that they could get their animals taken away. I'm not sure about that part because it's only two of the cats. I'm not sure why they would get all of them taken away. AITA ? She said she would try her best to keep the cats inside which is nice but so far  it's reduced the frequency but the cat still set off my alarms 11 times today still.  The cats are outside all day and at my house mostly.  It's getting frustrating in my end.

Things I've done: sprayed outside with scent they don't like, orange peels, vinegar, coffee grounds, a sound machine that scares off pest (motion sensor). Nothing works.  ",1,1761095219.0,felinebehavior,3,0.67,False
