1h2c0x7,https://www.reddit.com/r/acidreflux/comments/1h2c0x7/discomfort_for_a_week/,Discomfort for a week,"So since I was younger I would have times where I could feel the acic coming up after certain meals. There was very few times where I was up in pain with the burning sensation in my throat. Nothing crazy and not often at all. 

About a week ago I started feeling discomfort in my upper abdomen. It's not like a burning, more like bloating/pressure or gas i thought. 

I then began to feel a slight burning in the bottom of my throat along with gurgling and the ""lump"" feeling. Along with this i would notice a slight bitter taste coming up from the bottom of my throat.  I began to realize this is acid reflux. It's been about a week now and the symptoms are still there. The pain is very manageable and not too bad at this point, more uncomfortable than anything. Like I said it's weird because it's not a burning feeling (other than in my throat) but more of a slight pressure pain in my upper abdomen. I did go to the dr and he put me on pantoprazole which i have been taking now for 4 days. When will I begin to feel relief?  Anyone have similar symptoms regarding the bloating / gas pain feeling in your upper stomach? 

I have been trying to change my diet (especially around drinking coffee). Any other suggestions? Thank you",1,1732848603.0,acidreflux,0,1.0,False

1h2c0ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1h2c0ck/uncertain_about_internship_placement_after/,Uncertain about internship placement after receiving a verbal offer,"I recently received a verbal ux deisgn internship offer from a company. However, I was told a couple days later that the team/location I was assigned to no longer has space for interns. My recruiter said that she working on finding another team to place me in.

A few day's after this, the recruiter reached out to let me know they’ve set up a meeting for me to have a coffee chat with a senior person on the design team (from the original location i was supposed to be placed in). I’m unsure if this chat is to assess whether I could be a fit for another team, to discuss alternative opportunities, or if it’s just a professional courtesy to explain that the offer might be canceled.

I’m wondering:

1. Has anyone else faced something similar? What was the outcome?
2. Could this coffee chat be a positive sign that they’re trying to place me, or is it more likely just to maintain a professional connection for the future?
3. What advice would you give for navigating this situation?

1h2bz3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h2bz3n/aitah_for_exposing_my_aunts_secret_facebook/,AITAH for exposing my aunts secret facebook account?,"Welp this just happened.  

My (32M) family usually doesnt do much for thanksgiving, immediate family comes over for a late lunch at my grandparents house, immediate family that has moved away and extended family do their own thing, and we usually have a group call at some point.  But this year, at the last minute behest of my aunt Karen (59F), all my immediate family decided they were going to fly in and we were going to have a grand ole thanksgiving for ages.  Great, fucking great.  

See for the most part i like and get along with my family, i love when we all get together for non somber occasions because its a rarity, even if its exhausting hosting my ass off. But I cannot stand dealing with Karen, shes nosy (literally will sneak off to look through other peoples rooms) nothing is ever good enough for her (especially if im part of it), self centered, demands respect while giving almost none in return, etc, but hides it all behind being ""folksy"".  Somehow this works on most people, including my family because they for the most part, because they genuinely dont think shes a terrible person.  My uncle Mark (63M) has also been madly in love with her for over a decade, so I have eaten shit from her with a smile for over ten years.  Thankfully she does not come to many family events because shes busy traveling for her ""art career"".  

Well, nothing i can do about it.  Thus the day of reckoning arrives, we all pile in to my grandparents house, i busy myself helping with cooking enough food to feed a small nation, while Karen arrives her standard 30 minutes late (Mark arrived on time lol) with some tale that starts with ""OMG yall wont believe what just happened to me"" with her spawn Chase (35M) and his wife Kelly (27F), and kids (Kile 5M and Bryttani 3F, no those are not typos) in tow.  While Karen regales most of my family with her fantastical tale (something to do with an unhoused person having an episode) my aunt Ida (56F) rolls over to the kitchen and tells me she has something to show me. 

Now Ida isnt technically my aunt, shes my aunts sister,, who is very neurodivergent and mildly schizophrenic.  In spite of her challenges in life, shes a sweetheart, but very blunt and to the point (i love this about her), which some people can find off putting, and shes whip smart, and very very very good at finding shit, often time that people would rather keep hidden.  So if Ida says she has something she wants to show me, I'm more than a little curious as to what shes found.  I pull off my apron and follow behind as she rolls down the hall into the guest room to show me her unholy knowledge.  Its Karen's facebook account, her secret one, with her name misspelled in a weird way and her middle initial, has like 25 followers, no security, with her reposting all sorts of vile racist, sexist, bigoted, end of the world shit, and of course, her allegiance to Trump as the Christian messiah .  Going back fucking years.  Holy fuck.  I have proof of how awful she is. Nuclear grade proof. And Ida has screenshots, a literal archive of most of the horrible shit she posted and reposted and commented.  Before i could i figure out what to do with said information, Mark yells down the hall that dinners ready.  

We all get seated, my grandparents wait for the kids to start saying Grace (theyre religious, most of us arent but it makes them happy so we let them do it), Grace is said, we then all go around stating what were thankful for.  Most people keep it short and sweet, ""im thankful for my family"", ""im thankful we can all be here tonight"", ""im thankful for my iphone"" etc, but Karen goes on a little speech about how its time for families to come together and reconcile, in order for good to keep triumphing over evil, with the toothiest grin imaginable.   Shit, not a good sign.  Meanwhile all i can think about is what shes saying now with what shes posting on her secret account and realizing the depths of her depravity.  

Thankfully, dinner starts not long afterwards and her speech is forgotten as people silently devour the food before them. Once the plates are scraped clean some go for seconds, while the under 18's ask to be excused so they dont have to listen ""boomers talking about boring shit"".  They depart to the guest room to watch TV as long as its PG and not brainrot content with at least a few eyerolls.  The rest of us adults are all sitting at the dinner table making small talk in small groups, getting caught up, while I'm handling clean up duty and pie/tea/coffee distribution.  Inevitably, Karen throws some barbs at me as i walk by: 

""you put too much sugar in my coffee!  it tastes nasty"" (i put exactly how much you asked for)

""Dont drop it!"" (really?)

""this pie tastes a little funny, are you sure you baked it right?"" (yup, its the same damn pie ive made every year for the last 15 years)

""I love coming here! its like being at a restaurant, great food, great company, and a mediocre server!"" (the audacity of this bitch)

and more, each time i swallow my venom knowing, and smile, which gets harder each time because i now have a way to punch back.  Of course the more politely i respond to Karens thinly veiled insults the more she feels the need to throw at me.  Since I'm not biting at her barbs she, i guess, decided to change tactics, and starts loudly talking about her sons accomplishments.  Apparently hes been promoted to assistant manager at his union job, and he and his wife are celebrating their anniversary soon.  And apparently every time she talks about this she feels the need to stare into the depths of my soul while I'm chatting with my uncles.  Once again, i ignore her, not gonna bite.  

After a good 10-15 minutes of realizing her tactic isnt working she decides to turn her attention to Ida, whose sitting in a corner doing a sudoku puzzle with my grandparents cats on her lap.  If it wasnt obvious, Ida and Karen do not like each other, and Ida tends to avoid her like the plague as shes rather non confrontational, and Karen, to her credit, usually leaves Ida alone.  But not tonight.  Now i dont know what was said in the beginning, i was in the kitchen loading the dishwasher, but when i reentered the living roomi saw them having an animated conversation away from the rest of the family, and as i walked towards Karen and Ida to defuse i heard the end of Karen saying:

""God what is wrong with you???""

As she leaned down and got into Idas personal space

My grandfather loves Michelle Obamas ""when they go low, we go high"".  Fuck that.  When they go low you hit back as hard as you fucking can.  I can handle shit being flung at me, been dealing with it my entire life, but i will not tolerate people going after those they perceive as weaker than themselves.  

Me: ""shut the fuck up""

Karen ""how DARE you speak to me like that young man!  She being rude. I am TRYING to help your aunt socialize more with family on such a wonderful day.  Were all here and shes sitting the corner by herself.  She can do that any other day!""

Me: ""Bullshit""

Karen: ""Bullshit?!  Where are your manners?!  IF this is how you treat someone whose only trying to help others you shouldnt be here""

Me: ""Help others??? you are one of the most entitled people I have ever fucking met, the only person you help is yourself""

At this point i realized that the entire room has gone silent and the rest of the family is staring at us.  

Karen: ""Do you have any idea how much i help my community as a small business owner???  How many jobs i create, how much i donate to charity, how much i volunteer to help those in need.  If you cant see how much Ive helped you and everyone else in this room, you are truly lost.  I have and always will continue to do the Lords work, but theres only so many false accusations a person can take""

Me: "".........""

Karen: ""Please, do yourself a favor, and apologize, its clear that you have fallen down a dark path, take your first steps back into the light""

Me: ""Funny, cuz your facebook account doesnt look like someone whose particularly charitable""

Karen: ""See?  more false accusations, its a shame to see a young man with such potential continue to lie through his teeth""

Me: ""Your secret one, not normal one""

Karen ""How ridiculous are your lies going to get?""

Ida decided to chime in here: ""Its Karen, K a a r i n n D Entitled, on NOV 23rd you posted ""i cant wait for all those dirty fucking illegals to be deported back to their shithole countries.  Rip out the bloodsucking parasites!""

""On NOV 21st you reposted ""Grab her by the pussy?  you wish!""

""On NOV 14th you posted ""No more male rapists in the womens bathrooms!  The violent lefts war on women will not be tolerated!""""

""On NOV 6th you poste ""YES!!! Good will always triumph over evil.  'those who plow evil and those who sow trouble reap it.' Job 4:8""""

like some sort of racists destroying supercomputer Ida continued to, from memory, repeat back all sorts of bigoted posts Karen had made or reposted, as the rest of the family pulled out their phones to check if what Ida said was the truth.  You could see on peoples faces first confusion, then disgust as they realized what kind of monster Karen had been hiding underneath.   Karen stood there completely frozen, all the color had gone from her usually rosy face.  And then She. Lost. It.  

Started screaming at us about we were a bunch of heathen liberals who God, by his instrument Trump, would cleanse in the reckoning that would soon come.  How she had been trying to help use ""see the light"" and since Trump won it was time for us to abandon our sicked sinful ways and repent to the Lord.  How she cant stand that my sister lets her daughter fornicate with women.  How we are effectively a bunch of worthless peasants she has taken pity on and how grateful we should be that she dares grace us with her presence.

At this point i pour more gasoline on the fire and said that Trump has more in common with the Anti-Christ than Christ and Karen started screaming at me calling me a direct agent of Satan (what a compliment!).  My Grandfather, Bill (88M) stepped in at this point, and shouted ""ENOUGH"", told me to leave, now, before i did more damage to this family.  

So i left, with a room of stunned family members behind me.  i made a quick goodbye to my nieces and nephews, who were extremely confused why i was leaving early and busy watching TV.  Now Im home and phone is blowing up from family members who attended, family who didnt and heard second hand, and even friends who heard about it through the grapevine.  And realizing that i may have completely destroyed my relationships with my family.

Crypto isn't just a currency—it's an *experience*. One day you're sipping coffee, casually watching your portfolio grow, and the next you're questioning your life choices because a meme coin just outperformed your carefully researched investment.

**Why we love it:**  
✅ Decentralization vibes 🌐  
✅ It's the Wild West of finance 🤠  
✅ Everyone loves a good ""when moon?"" joke 🌕

But let’s get real for a sec—crypto is more than just trading. It's revolutionizing how we think about money, ownership, and even identity (shoutout to NFTs and DeFi). Sure, there are risks, but isn’t that part of the fun? 😏

**Pro Tips for Survival in the Crypto Jungle:**

1. DYOR = *Do Your Own Research*. Don't just YOLO.
2. HODL your emotions. FOMO and panic-selling are your enemies.
3. Remember: Every ""to the moon"" story has a ""re-entry to Earth"" moment. 🌍

So, whether you’re a whale, a shrimp, or just here for the memes, let's keep riding this wave of innovation. After all, the future is decentralized, and we're just getting started. 🚀✨

1h2bmck,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/comments/1h2bmck/ezekiel_the_turkey/,"Ezekiel, The Turkey","The chill from outside has infiltrated your bedroom by the time you sit up in bed. The first thing you do is climb out from beneath the covers, leaving them in a disheveled heap, and shuffle to the kitchen. You start brewing a single-serving pumpkin-spiced cappuccino pod in your coffee maker before heading back to the bedroom to pull on your favorite sweater. It’s old, oversized, and its frayed cuffs brush softly against your wrists.

Cradling your steaming cappuccino, you step outside. Your boots crunch softly against the lightly ice-kissed porch. The first frost of the season glimmers faintly on the grass like the shattered glass of broken tears—silvering the edges of scattered leaves and lending the yard an almost magical stillness.

You take a sip, savoring the warmth, and lean against the porch railing. It’s quiet, the kind of morning that feels untouched by time—until you spot it.

The turkey stands at the far edge of the yard, its dark, hulking form is outlined by the weak morning sun. It stares back at you. It doesn’t move, doesn’t blink, only stares. For a moment, your eyes are locked with its tiny black ones, and then, on a whim, you call out:

“Hey!”

The turkey’s head jerks up, but it isn’t startled. Oddly, it seems to crane its neck toward you, as if it’s listening. Without missing a beat, you pitch your voice into a high, cracking falsetto, the way some people give voices to their dogs:

“Hello?” you reply for it.

You grin, rolling with the lines: “Guess what?!”

In that same, exaggerated voice, you answer for it: “What?”

“You really wanna know?”

“Yesss!”

“Fuck you!” You tell the bird.

“Fuck you!” It replies.

“No, fuck you!”

“What’s your name?!” you imagine the turkey asking.

“Tony!” you call back.

“Fuck you, Tony!”

“*Fuck you!*” You respond, “What’s your name?

“What?”

“What’s *your name?!”*

“Ezekiel!”

You squint at the bird, your grin widening as you hold back a laugh at how stupid you’re being, doing this on a Tuesday morning in your yard at the edge of the forest. “Ezekiel?! That name fuckin’ *sucks!”*

The turkey doesn’t flinch. It doesn’t react at all, and somehow that makes the whole thing funnier. You’re still laughing when a second turkey ambles out from behind the oak tree—this one smaller and scruffier. It immediately starts pecking at the frosted grass like it’s on a mission.

“Oh great,” you say, gesturing with your coffee mug. “Ezekiel brought backup.”

The smaller turkey ignores you entirely, too busy tearing into the ground, but Ezekiel stays still. His head is still tilted toward you, ever so slightly, his black eyes locked on yours from a hundred yards away.

You take another sip of your cappuccino, still grinning. “Alright, Ezekiel. Let’s see what you and your sidekick think of birdseed.”

You head to the steel feed barrel where you keep seed for the bird feeders. There’s been little point in refilling them these past two weeks, as the cold has driven most of the birds south. Scooping out a heaping helping of seed, you set your coffee on the porch handrail and step cautiously into the yard.

As you approach, the birds begin to retreat. The smaller one turns its back completely, sprinting into the dense underbrush, but Ezekiel backs away slowly, his beady eyes never leaving you. When you reach the spot where he first stood, you spread the seed on the ground for him and his scruffy friend.

Walking back toward the house, you hear your phone ringing from the counter in the kitchen. Scratching at the stubble on your chin, you grab your coffee from the railing and slide the kitchen door open, stepping inside.

The warmth of the house greets you as you cross the linoleum, careful not to spill your cappuccino as you move quickly to the counter. Your phone sits where you left it, ringing insistently, the screen lighting up with a name you haven’t seen in quite some time: *Mom.*

You sigh, swiping the screen to deny the call. The ringtone cuts off, but before you can set the phone down, the voicemail notification pings. You hesitate, staring at it for a moment before pressing play.

Her voice is the same as always—calm, clipped, careful. “Hi,” she begins, but then pauses. The silence stretches long enough for you to pull the phone from your ear and glance at the screen to check if the call has ended. It hasn’t.

“Listen. It’s been years since you’ve come home for Thanksgiving, Tonya, and—”

Your jaw tightens, and you don’t let her finish. With irritation curling hot in your chest, you press 7, deleting the message mid-sentence. Setting the phone back on the counter, you shake your head and mutter, “Even Ezekiel wouldn’t have started the message like that, Mom, and he’s a fucking turkey that doesn’t know any better.”

The thought almost makes you laugh, but the edge lingers. You take another sip of coffee, exhaling sharply through your nose as you look out the kitchen window.

Neither turkey has returned to the yard, but you see Ezekiel standing at the edge of the forest, still watching.

“Strange fuckin’ bird,” you mutter.

\------------------------------------

By lunchtime, the sun has risen higher, melting just enough of the morning’s jagged, icy sheen to blunt the sharp, shattered edges of the yard’s glass-like surface. The thaw hasn’t softened it entirely; the grass still glints with reflective fractures, catching the light like fresh cracks spreading through a brittle mirror.

You toss together a quick sandwich—peanut butter and banana on slightly stale bread, because the thought of braving Rife’s Market in the center of Bradenville today feels like a battle not worth fighting—and step outside with it in hand.

Ezekiel is still there.

He stands near the edge of the yard. Before you came outside, he was strutting and pecking at the ground, but now that you’ve settled into your chair, balancing the plate on your knee, he’s gone completely still. His head tilts ever so slightly, as though he’s listening to something only he can hear.

“You’re persistent, I’ll give you that,” you say, taking a bite of your sandwich. “Maybe that’s what I like about you. You stick around. Don’t care what anyone thinks.”

You laugh softly to yourself, brushing crumbs off your lap, “Not like Patty Filmore at the grocery store the week before last. She was going on about how Deke Coffee up the road has some kind of glowing-blue-eyed kid with a squid in its mouth locked in his basement. Can you believe that? A watery-blue-eyed child. With a squid. In its mouth.”

You pause, staring out at Ezekiel as if he might offer some kind of insight, but he just stands there, still as ever, with his beady black eyes locked onto yours.

“I mean, she said it had a beak inside its throat and everything,” you continue, grinning. “Claimed it clicked when the kid talked. Imagine that, Ezekiel. Little squid beak clicks every time it says something. ‘Hi! My name’s Squid Kid, nice to meet you,’ click-click-click. What the hell’s wrong with this town?”

You pitch your voice higher, giving Ezekiel his personality again: “I don’t know, Tony. I think Patty’s onto something. Maybe you should check it out.”

“Oh, sure,” you reply, rolling your eyes as if the conversation were real. “‘Scuse me, Mr. Deke. Hi, sorry… just wondering if you’ve got some kind of cephalopod child down there in your basement? Heard you did.’ That won’t get me banned from another town meeting or anything. Bad enough Pastor Thomas’s wife runs all of them.”

Ezekiel doesn’t move. Doesn’t blink.

“Besides,” you add, finishing your sandwich, “even if there was some creepy squid kid in Deke Coffee’s basement, he’d be more apt to shoot me with his shotgun than invite me inside to see it. I’m kind of the pariah around here currently. Not exactly neighbor of the year.”

You glance at Ezekiel, narrowing your eyes thoughtfully. “But you?! You’ve got that whole enigmatic, loner vibe going. Maybe he’d let you inside. Give you the VIP tour.”

In your imagined falsetto, Ezekiel replies: “Tony, I’m just a turkey. We’re not really into squid kids.”

That makes you laugh. “Alright, fine. Fair point.”

Satisfied with the conversation, you stand and stretch, brushing crumbs off your jeans. Ezekiel doesn’t move as you go back inside, closing the kitchen door firmly behind you.

\------------------------------------

Your office is just down the hall, the glow of the computer monitor greeting you as you settle into your desk chair. Logging in, you glance at the list of emails waiting in your inbox. The day’s tasks loom large, but it’s your last workday before the long weekend, and you’re determined to finish everything.

The first email is straightforward, the kind of quick reply that makes you feel productive. The second is a little more complicated, and you lose yourself in the rhythm of typing, tweaking, and sending.

But every so often, your eyes drift to the office window.

Ezekiel is still there.

He doesn’t pace or wander like other birds. He doesn’t peck at the ground or strut about. Not anymore. He just…stands. Watching.

At first, you shrug it off, muttering, “Weirdo.” But by the fifth glance, it’s harder to ignore the tension curling in your stomach. He hasn’t moved. Not an inch.

The minutes drag on, and the weight of his stare presses on you like an invisible hand, heavy and persistent. By late afternoon, the sight of him has gone from amusing to unsettling.

When the sun begins its slow descent and shadows stretch long across the yard, you decide to logout for the day. Everything else can wait until next Monday. You head outside to bring in the empty trash can from the curb, glancing nervously toward the woods. The yard is quiet, almost too quiet. You half-expect to see him there, standing in the same spot, but it’s empty now—the edge of the forest cloaked in shadows.

You exhale slowly, trying to shake off the unease. It’s just a turkey, you remind yourself. A weird turkey, sure, but a turkey nonetheless.

Still, when you step back inside, you make a point of locking the kitchen door behind you. The sound of the bolt sliding into place feels louder than it should, echoing in the stillness of the house.

You glance out the window one last time, but the yard is empty. 

Or at least, it looks empty.

\------------------------------------

Wednesday morning greets you with the kind of chill that sneaks into your bones before you’ve even had your first cup of coffee. Pulling your sweater over your head, you step onto the porch, warm drink in hand, and pause mid-sip.

Ezekiel is there.

He stands in nearly the same spot as yesterday, closer to the house this time, his dark shape distinct against the muted backdrop of the waking woods. His outline looks sharper in the morning light, every ridge of his feathers catching faint shadows, giving his form an almost jagged appearance. His head tilts slightly, a deliberate, inquisitive motion, as though he’s greeting you—or sizing you up. You sigh, rolling your eyes. “Morning, Ezekiel.”

The turkey doesn’t respond, of course, but you don’t need him to. You take another sip and lean against the railing, letting the steam from your mug rise to warm your face.

“You know, I was thinking about Peony last night,” you say, your voice soft and distant, like you’re talking more to yourself than him. “Peony McIntyre. We went to school together. She always had these little yellow ribbons tied into her hair. They were bright, like sunlight.” You pause, rubbing the back of your neck. “I had the biggest crush on her. Never said a word about it, of course. Why would I? Just got to watch her from a distance, all perfect and glowing like she belonged in some storybook.”

You glance at Ezekiel, his beady black eyes still locked on yours. “Guess that makes me the fool, huh? Standing around pining after someone who never even looked my way. Ah well, doesn’t matter now.”

Ezekiel doesn’t respond.

“You got a girl from a storybook, dumb bird?” 

In the bird’s voice, you respond: “Storybook? Yellow ribbons I understand, but storybooks? What’s that?”

“Nevermind,” you tell him, shaking your head at the ridiculousness of what you’re doing. Straightening up, you shout: “Alright, wish me luck, Ezekiel. Gotta go into town, pick up some supplies, and avoid anyone who’s gonna make a scene. You know how it is—always someone with something to say.”

\------------------------------------

The drive into Bradenville is uneventful, save for the rumble of your old Chevy truck on the road. The heater wheezes faintly as it fights to warm the cabin, and the radio crackles with static. You’re grateful for the quiet, though. It gives you a moment to steel yourself for any potential encounters.

At Tractor Supply, the air smells of feed and motor oil, the faint twang of something sang by Lee Ann Womack is playing over the speakers. You head straight for the feed aisle, scanning the neatly stacked bags until you find the one you’re looking for: a 25-pound bag of turkey meal, forest green with cheerful photos of turkeys printed across the front. Hefting it onto your shoulder, you carry it to the register.

As you punch your PIN into the keypad, you hear her voice.

“Ton—I mean, Tony. Tony! Oh my sweet goodness, I thought that was you. My, do you look different.”

You glance up to see Mrs. Thomas, the pastor’s wife, standing behind you, her hands clasped tightly over her purse, her smile just a little too forced.

“Hello, Mrs. Thomas,” you say evenly, focusing on the screen.

“Your momma told me she’s been trying to reach you, and—”

“My ‘momma,’” you interrupt, keeping your tone calm but firm, “knows what needs to be done if she wants to mend things. That’s between her and me. And frankly, Mrs. Thomas, I think you know as well as I do that pretending to respect me isn’t the same as actually doing it. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got a lot to get done today.”

Mrs. Thomas blinks, her smile faltering for just a moment before it snaps back into place. “Well,” she says, her voice tight, “you have a Happy Thanksgiving, Tony.”

“You too,” you reply curtly, taking your receipt and bag.

Outside, the cold air bites at your face as you toss the bag into the bed of your truck. Climbing into the driver’s seat, you mutter, “I’m doing this for you, Ezekiel. Hope you appreciate the gesture.”

\------------------------------------

By the time you get home, the sun is already dipping low, its light golden and soft against the trees. Ezekiel is still in the yard, standing exactly where you left him that morning.

*“So fuckin’ odd, this bird.”* You mutter to yourself, slamming the truck’s stubborn rusty-hinged door.

You haul the heavy bag inside, setting it on the kitchen island before stepping out and grabbing the scoop of birdseed you keep in the bin for the feeders. Stepping cautiously out into the yard, you approach him.

This time, Ezekiel doesn’t back away. He watches you intently, his head cocked, his stillness unnerving. You stop a few feet away, bending down to spread the seed across the ground in front of him.

“There you go,” you say softly. “Umm—something to tide you over until tomorrow, I guess...”

His eyes never leave yours, their black, glossy surface unreadable.

You straighten, the hair on the back of your neck prickling as you take a step back. Then another. Ezekiel doesn’t move. He doesn’t eat.

“Goodnight, then, you freaky fucker.”

Back inside, you lock the kitchen door, twisting the deadbolt with more force than necessary. Leaning against the counter, you rub at your arms, trying to shake the lingering unease.

“He’s not friendly,” you murmur to yourself. “He’s not menacing, either. Just…it’s just a weird turkey. That’s all.”

\------------------------------------

It’s sometime after three in the morning when you find yourself curiously staring out from your bedroom window. The yard is bathed in pale moonlight, the frost glittering like shards of glass on the grass below. At first, the scene feels serene, even beautiful. But then you see him.

Ezekiel stands alone, in his usual spot.

He is a lone shadow perched unnaturally still in the center of the backyard, his silhouette sharp yet distorted in the faint silver glow. His body seems too large for a turkey, the curve of his back arched high, his head angled unnervingly low, like a predator lying in wait. The feathers along his wings and back gleam faintly, catching the moonlight in thin, metallic slivers, as though the bird were made of something far denser than flesh and bone.

Something feels… off. What is that strange shimmer around his edges, as though he isn’t entirely solid? You rub your eyes, but the shimmer doesn’t go away.

Then he moves.

No—not moves. He *ripples.*

And it begins.

At first, it’s just a faint quiver in his chest, like a bird shaking off water. But the trembling grows more violent, the body contorting unnaturally. And then, without a sound, he *tears* in two.

A second turkey emerges, identical to the first. The process is smooth, disturbingly clean, like the turkey is replicating itself cell by cell. A shudder runs down your spine as you remember those old high-school biology videos of mitosis, where a single cell splits in two. Only this time, the single cell is a fully-formed turkey, and it isn’t stopping.

The two turkeys ripple and divide into four. The four become eight. The eight become sixteen. The multiplication accelerates until the yard is overrun, a heaving, pulsating mass of identical birds. They’re all smaller than he is at first, their forms shimmering and flickering, as if they aren’t entirely solid—then they grow slowly larger to match his size and become opaque, and then they split. They split. And they split. 

And split again.

Each one stares directly at your window. Their eyes glow like gas stove flames, blue and quavering, flickering faintly in the darkness.

You try to back away, but your legs refuse to move. The turkeys continue to split, each one an exact replica, their beaks sharp and glinting in the moonlight. The yard is no longer visible—just an endless sea of multiplying bodies, their rippling forms shimmering grotesquely as they grow in number.

Then Ezekiel, the *original* Ezekiel, looks at you.

But they’re all the same bird—copies. *They’re all Ezekiel,* you realize.

And Ezekiel steps forward.

He moves unnaturally smoothly, as though gliding rather than walking, and the others follow in perfect synchronization. They reach the base of the house and begin to climb, their claws scraping against the siding. You can hear them now, a relentless scratching that grows louder and louder, drowning out your breathless gasps.

One of them reaches the window. Is it the *original* Ezekiel or a copy? You can’t be sure. Does it matter? Its glowing blue, burning eyes are inches from yours, staring into you. Its beak taps the glass once. Twice as if trying to break through. The glass seems to flex with each peck…

And then it lunges—

\------------------------------------

You gasp and sit bolt upright, your chest heaving. But you’re not in bed—you’re on the floor next to the window. Your right hand is gripping the sill so tightly your knuckles ache. The morning sun streams through the glass, warm and golden, erasing the nightmare’s suffocating shadows. The yard is empty, blanketed in frost and light.

You let out a shaky laugh, the tension in your chest unraveling all at once. “What the hell,” you mutter, rubbing your temples with trembling fingers. “Pull yourself together.”

Then a shadow moves across the window, just below the frame.

You freeze. Slowly, you lean closer, and a head rises into view.

Ezekiel.

Its black eyes lock onto yours, its head tilting the way it always does. You yelp, a sharp bark of fear that quickly melts into nervous laughter. “Damn it, dude, you scared me!” you say, pressing a hand to your chest. “You’re early. Couldn’t wait for your seed, huh? I uh—I got something else for you today—something, uh—something better? I think.”

He doesn’t move. Doesn’t blink. He just stares, and for a fleeting moment, you could swear he’s smiling.

\------------------------------------

You step outside, the cool air brushing against your face, and heft the bag of feed from the kitchen island onto your shoulder. The weight settles awkwardly, but manageable, as you move toward the porch. Ezekiel’s dark form is already waiting in the yard, his stillness more expectant than before.

“You’re one demanding bird, you know that?” you say, your voice light with a chuckle as you descend the porch steps. “I’ve got your Thanksgiving dinner right here, buddy.”

As you make your way toward him, Ezekiel moves—something he hasn’t done in days. He steps back, just one step at first, his head tilting sharply toward the woods. You pause mid-step, frowning. “What’s this, huh? You’re not getting cold feet now, are you?”

Ezekiel doesn’t respond, of course. Instead, he backs away further, the motion deliberate, his eyes locked on you as if beckoning. Then, with startling speed, he turns and rushes toward the tree line. He doesn’t disappear completely—just enough to be swallowed by the dense undergrowth, where he pauses, his head snapping back to look at you.

You hesitate, shifting the weight of the bag on your shoulder. “You want me to follow you?” you mutter, half to yourself.

Ezekiel jerks his head forward, urging you on.

Something tugs at you—curiosity, maybe, or something deeper and more instinctual. You step cautiously toward the woods. The branches sway slightly in the faint breeze, and they brush against your sweater as you push through them, grabbing at you like dozens of skeletal hands. The forest smells damp, earthy, and faintly of petrichor—the morning's frosty dew soaked into the soil. Patches of light filter through the tangled canopy, casting patterns on the ground that shift like the reflections from a broken mirror, high in the sky.

“Alright, Ezekiel,” you call, your voice muffled by the trees. “If you’re leading me to your weird turkey cult or something, I’m gonna be real upset—probably.”

The turkey doesn’t stop, darting between the trees with an unnerving ease. You try to keep up, your boots crunching over brittle twigs and dead leaves, the occasional vine tugging at your ankle. The air feels heavier the further you go, like the weight of the forest itself is pressing down on you. Sunlight grows scarce, swallowed by the towering pines and gnarled oaks. Their branches are interlocking like the ribs of a great beast, still sleeping this early in the morning.

Then you see it.

A clearing opens before you, bathed in pale, golden light. The trees around it stand unnaturally still, their rough trunks covered in patches of something dark and oily, gleaming faintly in the sun. The ground here is strangely bare—no leaves, no grass—just smooth, dark soil that looks as though it’s been tilled by unseen hands. Ezekiel stands at the center with his friend from the other morning pecking the ground behind him. Ezekiel himself is motionless…his form sharp and imposing against the eerie stillness.

You step forward, the bag of feed shifting awkwardly as you cross the threshold into the clearing. Something about the air here feels alive, charged with a quiet energy that makes your skin prickle. You set the bag down and kneel, fumbling with the corner to tear it open. Ezekiel doesn’t move. He doesn’t even blink.

“Ah. I see. Brought me to your friend,” you say, forcing a laugh to steady your nerves. “Hope you’re both hungry. Got enough here for plenty—more than just the two of you, but it’s all yours, I guess.”

As you pour the feed onto the ground, the sound seems unnaturally loud in the silence. You glance up at Ezekiel, expecting him to move, to peck at the dried, ground cornmeal, but he remains perfectly still. His head tilts ever so slightly, his black eyes boring into yours.

You step back, brushing your hands off on your jeans. “I hope you guys like it,” you say, smiling. “It’s good to give back sometimes, you know?”

The turkey tilts its head. It seems to rise up onto its talons, growing taller—bigger—until its beady black eyes are level with yours.

For the first time, it speaks—not the friendly, imagined voice you’ve been projecting onto it for days, but something low, guttural, and undeniably real.

“Hush,” it says.

*“What?!”* you exclaim in terror. “*You—you don’t talk! You say ‘gobble gobble!’”*

“Gobble gobble?” Ezekiel scoffs. *“What kind of stereotypical?—forget it.* You know what? Shut the fuck up. Do that. My family and I prefer our meals quiet. Can you manage that? Can you shut the fuck up? You talk so fuckin’ much.”

A rustling rises from the woods. You turn, just in time to see them—the turkeys, dozens of them, their shadows swarming closer. They emerge from the trees with synchronized precision, their bodies glinting faintly in the shifting light.

You don’t even have time to scream before the first beak strikes, sharp and relentless, puncturing your eye with a wet crunch. Pain blinds you as another tears into your cheek, then your throat, the frenzy consuming you piece by piece and the sounds of the world fade to silence as your vision goes dark.

i sat down in her office to ask if i'm doing anything wrong. the entire conversation seemed like she picked at the smallest things. she told me how these two specific coworkers (yes, she said their names) were complaining about me, i asked what the complaints were. one of them was that, ""i saw you walk into work one day, and noticed you didn't say good morning to (coworkers name). that was very rude of you."" i always say good morning to everyone and ask how they are, but one day was a big deal to her. i told her that was just a mistake and that i didn't see him. it wasn't intentional at all, i just literally did not see him when i walked into work.  
  
 i asked what the other coworker was complaining about and she was smiling like a bully and said, ""well... it's just, your face."" i had no words and was so so confused. i was like, ""my face?"" which was offensive to me as an asian woman who grew up being bullied. then i noticed she paused and you can see that she regret saying it, then was like, ""actually, wait, i don't think he said exactly that."" and laughed it off. i was so confused but upset. like my stomach was turning. i started to tear up and straight up cry. i told her, ""everyone else in the building says i've been doing a good job, and that i look brighter lately."" then she was like, ""well are they the manager? of course they're not gonna tell you what i tell you. some people are two-faced. that's the real world. you're still young, but when you're older and get married and have kids, you'll know."" i just kept crying and after that she said, ""look, all you need to do is smile a lot more."" i was just silent, then said ""alright. thank you."" and just got up and silently left the room.

it hurts till this day what she said to me. especially because we work at an office and i'm always trying to keep the workplace a positive environment and keeping in touch with all my coworkers, even buying them lunch and coffee every now and then. but those words, ""your face"" as a complaint was so so hurtful. i can't look at myself the same without feeling insecure and trying to figure out what's wrong. we don't have a hr department, she's the office manager. i want to send a complaint, but not exactly sure how. i just don't want her to get away with what she said. i don't even know if it's discrimination overall",3,1732847156.0,careeradvice,5,1.0,False

Video Games - Recently beat Baldur's Gate 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. I just started Dragon Age: The Veilguard the other day. I play tons of genres though. Even toss in a few rounds of Overwatch from time to time.

Horror Movies - Horror is life. Especially a lot of the older stuff. Not to say that new stuff can't be good too, though, because it certainly can. Recent obsession is the Terrifier series. All three of those were so much fun.

Music - I lean heavily towards rock and metal, but I'll listen to almost anything. Angus McSix is my favorite band, it's power metal. I'm always open to new suggestions. Discovered Ice Nine Kills recently and been loving them, too.

Also a big (American) football fan, if anyone out there would like to talk about that.

It all started incredibly well in 2023. Our first date. I (22) was completely smitten; he (26) was the most handsome man I had ever seen. My heart was racing, and I enjoyed every second of that date. More dates followed. We traveled south together and visited romantic cities, lakes, and the sea. Unfortunately, out of nowhere, my depression hit me hard during this dreamlike vacation. Overwhelmed by my emotions, I suddenly became emotionally numb. I couldn’t feel anything anymore. I told him this with a heavy heart. 

I took time for myself to heal. He was heartbroken but stayed friends with me, and we even did some cool activities together. Slowly, I started feeling better. And suddenly, it was back—that feeling of being in love. I asked him if we could try again. He hesitated, but shortly after, it was clear: we became a couple in March. 

We had beautiful dates, shared evenings, and went out for dinner. He surprised me with a trip to a gorgeous mountain lake. But something was missing, and I didn’t want to admit it at first: in the 615 days (As of today, more to come later.) we’ve known each other, he has initiated sex only 2 or 3 times on his own. I was always the one to initiate it—always. Slowly and cautiously, never too much, just once a week at most, and never putting pressure on him. 

But eventually, even that was systematically rejected by him. He always says he’s tired. Recently, out of the last 20 times I’ve asked, he’s said no about 15 times. So, only once out of four does he say yes—and it’s happening less and less often, sometimes only every two or three weeks. I can’t do this. Before him, I used to have sex at least once a week, sometimes more. He’s my first serious relationship, and I love him. He listens to me attentively, supports me with even the wildest projects, checks in on me regularly, and buys groceries for me without me asking when I don’t have time to shop. 

But otherwise, he doesn’t initiate anything. If I don’t talk on the phone, there’s silence—no joke—for 10-20 minutes. Sometimes I’ve even made coffee or worked until he said something. He almost never tells me anything on his own, except for sensational news like a new purchase or family drama. Otherwise, he never shares anything personal, nor does he spark interesting topics or discussions. He’s a thoroughly passive person, and I’ve come to terms with that. But what I can’t accept is this constant disappointment whenever I want more than just lying next to each other on the couch. 

Other activities have also completely stopped. He’s too tired to go for walks or do anything else. I managed to convince him to go to two zoos and one movie theater, but only on very good days. Health-wise, there’s nothing wrong. We’ve checked every possible blood value and corrected any deficiencies with medication. Still, no improvement. 

I just can’t anymore. The need for sex and deep intimacy, which I always have to beg for or signal with a metaphorical megaphone (only to be rejected most of the time), frustrates me. It makes me feel unattractive, undesired. I’m falling back into a depressive hole. 

Even during our vacations together—which he made half unbearable through his lack of affection, passive-aggressiveness, outright aggression, indifference, excessive drinking, and general dissatisfaction (even blaming me for things like car accidents caused by his own mistakes)—there was only one instance of sex. If I was lucky, maybe a handjob. Once, after repeated pleading, we had sex (**once**) during a vacation—it’s just sad. At least when we’re not on vacation or staying in a hotel, he’s kind, attentive, and the perfect son-in-law. 

But otherwise, he’s always too tired for everything—if I even get an explanation at all. “Not today,” “I’d rather not,” “Let’s just watch an episode on AppleTV+.” Meanwhile, he has no problem doing heavy physical labor as a favor for friends at a private gardening business—suddenly, the tiredness disappears. 

Of course, handjobs are also rare exceptions. Has he still bought sexy fetish underwear that he never wears for me? Has he still purchased a BDSM set we’ve only used once? Has he still bought sex toys for himself? He’s definitely not asexual. No doubt. 

I’ve suggested several times that an open relationship would be fine with me. But he doesn’t want that—he’s too jealous. But to outright accuse him of never initiating anything sexual? I can’t. Out of fear that I might leave, he’d probably do anything. But I never want to emotionally blackmail him or coerce him into sex. That’s why I refuse to set an ultimatum. 

At least the recent revival of date nights and outings seems to be working. He’s at least mentioned some plans. 

I’ve already discussed this extensively with my sibling, my mom, and a dedicated chat group with all my friends who totally support me but also assume that it’s likely to get even less rather than more. Everyone says it’s unlikely to get better and that I should end it. And now, I’ve already taken steps to leave him, but he’s completely clueless. For him, none of this seems like a big deal. And I don’t want to be trapped in this relationship for years without any spark. Love alone is not enough for me. 

He’s currently in the hospital for a necessary surgery, and I’ll visit him tomorrow. For now, I’m keeping up appearances. He is still firmly convinced that we will move in together soon and maybe get a dog, but then I would end up as exactly the result everyone here warned against. Ten years in a relationship, my twenties gone and unfulfilled, stuck in a lease that’s hard to get out of, and with a dog to take care of.

But in all of this, I feel like the worst antagonist in a love drama that I could possibly imagine. My heart races every time I think about my plans. I feel sorrow. I feel pain. At the same time, every night I look forward to dreaming—sometimes of a wild night. 

P.S. We’ve already taken an in-depth fetish test, and I would follow everything exactly and make his fantasies come true—even if, by God, they aren’t mine—if only he’d want to. ",3,1732846550.0,DeadBedrooms,0,1.0,False
1h2bf7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Photobooks/comments/1h2bf7i/fun_stuff/,Fun Stuff,"Hi! I hope I'm not transgressing the rules--from what I could gather I don't think I am--but I wanted to make two recommendations for lovers of photobooks.

Number 1, if you live anywhere near Nashville, or ever find yourself passing through, you \*must\* stop at [Rhino Booksellers](https://rhinobooksellers.com/). It is about as classical an old-school second-hand bookshop run by legitimate bibliophiles as you will ever find--complete with bookshop cat, and friends of the proprietors who drop in at mid day with their guitars and have a completely informal jam session. (And there is a fantastic, tiny coffee shop a couple doors down.) They have a pretty nice selection of used photobooks on a shelf out in the store. But if you stop in, you must ask them to see the ""vault.""

In the back of the shop there is another, ""secret"" room with a security door where they keep all the \*really\* good stuff--including some certified classics of photobook history. At not at all unreasonable prices, as such things go. In two visits there on travels between Indianapolis and Atlanta, I've picked up a first edition of Bruce Davidson's East 100th Street, a really nice first-edition copy of Irving Penn's Flowers, a retrospective of Paul Strand's work, a handsome two-volume Focal Press Encyclopedia of Photography, and a couple of other nice things. And if I wasn't limited by budget, I could have easily walked out with several hundred dollars worth of other really tasty items. They might have \*the\* best selection of second-hand photo books I've seen in either the US or the UK for a non-specialist store. (In fact, the only second-hand store I've ever seen that had a bigger and better inventory was Photo Books International in London, which of course was dedicated to one topic and unfortunately closed several years ago.)

My second one is this: if you have a few like-minded people in your area, it's really fun to do a photobook meetup. I live in Indianapolis, and I was inspired by the semi-monthly Thursday Photobook Throwdown run by the proprietor of [Aurora PhotoCentre](https://www.auroraphoto.org/) here. The gallery has a pretty nice collection of books, and folks drop in and bring their own books to pass around. (Last month she brought in her personal French 1st Edition--**the** very first edition--of Frank's Les Américains, which was a treat.) Since I myself have a really big-ass shelf of photobooks of pretty good quality and range, I asked her if she would mind if I did one at my house, in months where she didn't do one--to which she of course is always invited.) I stocked up on beverages, adult and otherwise, and invited others to bring anything they liked in that line, and especially their favorite photobooks.

We've done that twice now. I had seven people show up each time (including a few repeats), and everyone seems to have enjoyed it so much--I certainly did--that they all asked when the next one was, and made clear they want to be invited. We had a nice mix of experienced photographers, young aspiring photographers, highly educated and sophisticated book connoisseurs, and others. Great convos, and everyone got a chance to see some really fine books from a variety of tastes and (particularly from my own collection) to see some books they had heard of but had never held.

As I say, if you can round up enough people who are interested and a good, comfortable venue to do it, you will find it extremely enjoyable and a great way to discover--and share--things that are new to everyone. And help yourself and others form friendships over a shared passion. I highly recommend it.",1,1732846497.0,Photobooks,0,1.0,False

The bartender told me it was made with vodka, Mr. Black coffee liqueur, Giffards passion fruit liqueur, and chickpea syrup to create the froth.

I’ve tried to make this at home and it’s been a flop.  I used egg white instead of the chick pea liquid and am not getting a froth.  Maybe it’s because I used egg white. I also think the passion fruit liqueur is too thick.  The drink comes out with particles throughout - it’s not wonderfully smooth like the one I had out.

Should I suggest a third date?,"I met this girl on Hinge, and we've only gone on two dates so far. We're both recent college graduates from out of state who moved to the same city for work. On our first date, we connected well at a new bakery as we shared ethnicity (which was rare in the city we’re at), we both work in corporate, and both having the same breed of dog back at our families’ homes. After the date, she texted me first to thank me for treating her to coffee and pastries, and mentioned that she had a great time. I responded that I enjoyed it too and suggested we do something again, which she said she gladly be open to.
My concern is that I'm not sure if she’s really interested in me, as sometimes she responds late, especially during weekdays, which I totally understand because we both work in demanding corporate jobs. Her job is a lot more demanding than me as her industry usually requires entry levels to work at least 60 hours a week.

But her texts are never dry, though—she responds enthusiastically and in multiple texts, and she only responds promptly in weekend or soon before/after our dates. On our second date, which was the weekend before Thanksgiving, I took her to a nice restaurant. We had a great conversation throughout the entire time, and she asked a lot of questions about me. She even casually suggested future plans we could do, but we didn't make solid plans for our next meetup since we were both were flying to visit our families for Thanksgiving and we wouldn’t see each other for almost 2 weeks.
After the date, I walked her to her car, she told me she had a lot of fun and we hugged goodbye. I texted her that I had a great time and wished her a fun Thanksgiving. She responded that she had a great time too and thanked me for dinner. She also asked me to send pictures of my dog when I see him during the break. A week later, I sent her some pictures of my dog, and she replied saying he was adorable and mentioned that she was visiting her cousin at the moment and will send pictures of her dog later in the week when she visits her parents. I texted her that Im excited to see her dog pics.
Now, it’s been several days since then, and I’m feeling anxious that she may not follow up with the pictures, especially since I assume she’s at her parent’s home. At this point, I feel like she’s not interested in me anymore since I’ve haven’t heard back from her.

Should I wait for her to send her dog photos till the end of the week or should I let things fade from here? Or do I wait after the break and suggest a third date? ",1,1732846033.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

My love of low carb cookies is no secret, and these Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks are right up there with the best of them! Primarily because they are no-bake, and therefore ready to eat in as little as five minutes! Also, they are intensely chocolatey, chewy and creamy at the same time, and they fall into the fat bomb category, so you can eat them anytime and not even feel bad about it! #allthewinning ? This Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks recipe was born of my desperate desire for something sweet and chocolatey RIGHT NOW, coupled with my being too lazy and impatient to want to actually bake something - or wait for said something to be ready to eat.  This pretty much describes my low carb life  you can relate, then this is your low carb cookie recipe my friends.  #lazyketochocolateloversunite The shredded coconut in these Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks makes them chewy and cookie-like, and the nuts add a pleasant crunch and earthy flavor.  If you are allergic to nuts then you can certainly omit them, or if you have a specific nut preference, you can sub in your nut of  you're a fan of fruit and nut bars, you can throw in a couple of dried cranberries or cherries (or ewww, raisins) into these keto cookies, but be mindful of the extra carbs if you do.  Mr. Hungry and I have been grabbing one of these no bake keto fudge haystack cookies for breakfast along with our coffee on busy mornings, and I've found that it easily keeps me satisfied until lunchtime! They make a great after dinner treat too - or pretty much whenever you want a blissful few bites of creamy chocolate goodness!

My handy dandy cookie dough scooper is in storage in New Jersey right now, so I just used two spoons to form my keto haystack cookies.  It's much easier and faster if you do have a scoop though, so I'll be bringing one back on my next trip to the States! These Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystack Cookies are everything you want in a low carb chocolate cookie fix! Quick, easy, delicious, creamy AND crunchy, and they've got that sweet / salty thing going on if you like that sort of thing! Which I do.  A 't wait for you to make these and hit me with your feedback in the comments!

This customer was an older customer and the Barista in question is mid-20's. The Barista prepared herself to engage with this customer and 'steered' the conversation seemingly as to keep things comfortable. She looked outside and noticed his truck bed was filled with wood and she said ""You have alot of wood in your truck"" He replied ""Oh I've got wood!"" and I pretty much knew what he meant by that. Still, I didn't say anything. I went and started a casual conversation with another Barista to distract myself (I'm well acquainted with everyone in this specific store). The Barista in question continued directing the conversation and keeping it light hearted until he got his order and left.

Remember the days when taking notes meant a cramped hand, smudged ink, and a mountain of paper? Well, I do. But then I discovered ergonomic stylus pens, and let me tell you, it was a game-changer. Now, my notes are neat, my hand is happy, and my digital devices are my best friends. Let's dive into my personal journey and explore the world of ergonomic stylus pens together.
  
  
## The Awakening: My Struggle with Traditional Pens

Taking notes with traditional pens was like trying to paint a masterpiece with a crayon. I remember those days vividly, sitting in class, armed with my trusty ballpoint pen that always seemed to have a mind of its own. The ink would either flow like a river or dry up faster than my motivation to study. And let’s not even talk about the infamous ink smudges. I can’t tell you how many times I ended up with a blue thumbprint that looked like I was auditioning for a role as a crime scene investigator.

The worst was during a math test. I was furiously scribbling down equations when suddenly, my hand cramped up like a pretzel. I had to stop, stretch, and hope my teacher wouldn’t notice. But of course, she did. “Are you okay?” she asked, raising an eyebrow. I just smiled awkwardly, trying to play it cool while my fingers felt like they were in a wrestling match with the pen. 

Then there were those moments when I’d write something brilliant, only to realize my pen had run out of ink. The panic was real! I’d frantically shake it, as if that would magically revive it. Spoiler alert: it didn’t. It was like a cruel game of hide and seek, where my notes were always just out of reach. Those experiences made me appreciate the idea of a better tool—something that wouldn’t cramp my style or my hand.

## The Discovery: My First Encounter with Stylus Pens

The first time I laid eyes on a stylus pen, I thought it was a magic wand for grown-ups. Seriously, I was in a coffee shop, minding my own business, when my friend Jake whipped one out like he was pulling a rabbit from a hat. He was doodling on his tablet, and I was mesmerized. I mean, who wouldn’t be? It looked so sleek and cool, gliding across the screen like a fish in water. But then, a wave of doubt crashed over me. Could I actually use one of those fancy things? My handwriting was already a chaotic mix of squiggles and hieroglyphics. Would a stylus pen really change that?

Read more: <https://tedsadvice.com/ergonomic-stylus-pen> 

Jake, ever the tech enthusiast, was all about the benefits. “You can take notes, draw, and it feels just like writing on paper!” he exclaimed, his eyes sparkling with excitement. I nodded, trying to hide my skepticism. What if it felt weird? What if I ended up with a fancy pen and still wrote like a toddler? But there was something about the idea that intrigued me. I could see the potential for neat, organized notes. My expectations were mixed, but curiosity was winning. Maybe this could be my ticket to note-taking nirvana.

## The Learning Curve: Figuring Out the Right Fit

Choosing my first ergonomic stylus pen was like trying to find the perfect pair of shoes—comfort is key, but style matters too. I began my quest by diving into the vast ocean of online reviews. I read everything from glowing testimonials to cautionary tales about pens that just didn’t cut it. One thing became clear: not all stylus pens are created equal.

I focused on a few essential features. First, the grip. I wanted something that felt good in my hand, not like I was trying to write with a slippery banana. Then there was the tip. I needed a fine point for precision, but not so fine that it felt like I was scribbling with a needle. Battery life was another biggie—who wants to be mid-note when your pen decides to take a nap? 

After narrowing down my options, I finally made my choice. The moment I held it, I felt like I was holding a magic wand. My first scribbles were a mix of excitement and awkwardness. I was trying to channel my inner artist, but it looked more like a toddler’s doodle. Still, there was something exhilarating about the smooth glide across the screen. I could almost hear the pen whispering, “You got this!” And, honestly, I felt like I was on the brink of a note-taking revolution.

## The Evolution: Upgrading to Premium Ergonomic Pens

Upgrading to premium ergonomic stylus pens was like going from a tricycle to a sports car. Seriously, I didn’t know what I was missing until I made the leap. My first stylus was a basic one, and let me tell you, it felt like I was trying to write with a stick. The tip was hard and unforgiving, and my notes looked like a toddler's art project—squiggly and chaotic. But then, I stumbled upon a pen that promised ergonomic magic. 

The moment I picked it up, I felt like I was holding something special. The grip was cushioned, and it fit my hand just right. I could write for hours without feeling like my fingers were staging a rebellion. The precision? Oh boy! I could actually see my handwriting improve. The ink flowed smoothly, making my notes look neat and professional. I even started to enjoy doodling during lectures—who knew I had an artist lurking inside?

One feature that blew my mind was the pressure sensitivity. I could create thick lines for emphasis or thin ones for delicate details. It was like having a whole toolbox at my fingertips. I found myself taking better notes, capturing ideas faster, and even organizing my thoughts more clearly. It felt less like a chore and more like an enjoyable part of my day. Have you ever had a tool change your game completely? That’s what this felt like for me.

## The Comparison: Traditional Pens vs. Ergonomic Stylus Pens

When you think about note-taking, the tool you choose can make a world of difference. I mean, who hasn’t experienced the frustration of a pen that runs out of ink right in the middle of a brilliant idea? Traditional pens have been our trusty sidekicks for ages. They’re simple, reliable, and let’s be honest, there’s something satisfying about the feel of ink gliding across paper. But, oh boy, they can also be a bit of a hassle. My hand would cramp up during long lectures, and I’d end up with squiggly scribbles that looked more like hieroglyphics than notes. 

Now, enter the world of ergonomic stylus pens. These beauties are designed with comfort in mind. They fit perfectly in your hand, making long writing sessions feel like a walk in the park. I remember the first time I tried one; it was like switching from a clunky old bicycle to a smooth, speedy scooter. The ease of writing on a tablet, where my notes could be organized and searched, was a game changer. 

But here’s the kicker: while stylus pens offer a sleek experience, they can sometimes be finicky. If the battery runs low or the screen isn’t calibrated, it can turn into a frustrating ordeal. So, in the battle of traditional vs. ergonomic stylus pens, it’s all about what works best for you. Do you crave the tactile feel of paper, or are you ready to embrace the digital age?

## The Future: Predictions and Trends in Stylus Pen Technology

The world of stylus pens is evolving faster than a cat chasing a laser pointer. Seriously! With each passing year, new innovations are popping up like popcorn in a microwave. One of the most exciting trends is the move toward smart technology. Imagine a stylus that not only writes but also connects to your favorite apps, syncing your notes in real-time. That means no more frantic searching for that one doodle you did during math class—everything is right at your fingertips!

Another fascinating development is the improvement in pressure sensitivity. Some stylus pens are now able to detect the lightest touch, allowing you to create everything from delicate sketches to bold, thick lines with just a flick of your wrist. It’s like having a whole art studio in your pocket! Plus, the ergonomic designs are getting better, making it feel like you’re holding a magic wand instead of a writing tool. Who wouldn’t want that?

Looking ahead, I can’t help but wonder if we’ll see stylus pens that can actually translate your handwriting into text with even greater accuracy. Talk about a game-changer! And let’s not forget about sustainability. As we become more eco-conscious, I predict we’ll see more stylus pens made from recycled materials. Wouldn’t it be cool to take notes while saving the planet at the same time?

## Conclusions
  
  
In conclusion, my journey with ergonomic stylus pens has been nothing short of transformative. From a clumsy note-taker struggling with traditional pens, I've evolved into a tech-savvy scribe, reaping the benefits of smooth, comfortable, and efficient digital note-taking. So, are you ready to ditch the ink stains and join the stylus revolution? Your future self will thank you! And remember, as they say, 'a smooth pen makes a smooth mind'—or in our case, a smooth stylus makes a smooth note-taker!",1,1732844574.0,EverythingErgonomic,0,1.0,False

Tears wept onto the pillow case, the torture, the guilt. Where have you gone, do I even exist to you anymore
Just strangers by design, the way you look through me. 

I always look out for you, crowds of grey faces
Tired ‘happy’ people. No colour, the light you bring

1h2aqri,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriott/comments/1h2aqri/miyako_osaka/,Miyako Osaka,"This was our third hotel in Japan and we stayed four nights at Miyako. It’s hard to not compare to the first two we stayed in (MESM Tokyo and Mitsui Kyoto and you can find my reviews for them as well under Marriott).  So here goes:

Miyako is located in the second tallest building in Japan. It lost to second place in 2023. It’s a gorgeous building and pretty much every room is going to afford you a pretty good view, which is a huge bonus ofc. 

Bottom part of this Abeno Haruka is a gigantic mall, full of shops, food courts and restaurants. Not enough for you? Two more big malls are within covered walking distance including MIo and O. Lots of little malls and shops around otherwise. Japan is seriously all about retail therapy! No shortage of ways to part you from your money. 

Ok back to hotel.  Take elevator to floor 19. Very nice lobby, great place to grab a drink or tea service if you want a view. 

Check in was super smooth and really among the best I experienced despite Miyako costing the least of the three hotels we stayed in. Very much felt appreciated as Titanium. We were upgraded for the night to a corner room on floor 45. Hotel has 57 floors, guest rooms stop at 55 and restaurant is on 57. We checked in on Labor Thanksgiving so they were fully booked. Next day they further upgraded me to a junior suite on highest level for that room type, floor 49. 

Rooms are nice but decor seems a little outdated tbh. First room had a puke green sectional that matched swirls in the carpet. Junior suite had better decor overall but still looks a bit dated.  TVs are older too. WC is in the same area as shower so it makes it less private. (I like them completely separate areas so someone can shower or brush teeth in private). Ladies, again with not great lighting in bathrooms for makeup. They do have a folding mirror outside by the table so I used that and natural lighting by all the windows. Beds are ok, a bit too firm and again with the flaccid pillows. I never got around to asking for foam so that’s my bad. I liked that the junior suite had a dedicated luggage room. Amenities were good including facial treatments for men/women and hair wax for the guys. 

The lounge for status members or club level was quite nice. 38th floor but no views which surprised me a bit. There are windows but overlook a closed deck. Lounge is large and a moderately decent breakfast is provided. Didn’t blow me away like MESM or Mitsui but I also get that may not be a fair comparison. Lounge also has mid afternoon tea and snacks as well as dinner. Tried dinner one night and decided it wasn’t for us. They do serve the same things every day. Water, coffee, tea and some sodas are available all day. Service was kind and attentive. 

We were given tickets to the observation deck at the top of the  building. It’s a destination spot for tourists and we were given two passes for every day we were there. Definitely worth checking out for 360 views of Osaka. You have to go down to go up. Train access is literally under the building so once you get your bearings you likely won’t even have to go outside to catch trains. Elevators up and down to trains and the mall are little confusing at first but you will get it. There is one elevator on the far right in some spots just to take you to Miyako which is helpful.  
Once in hotel you do need your key card for elevator but it automatically knows your floor so it won that over the other two hotels. 

Hotel is decent walking distance to areas like Shinsekai and a short train ride to Dotonburi, Udemo (several amazing malls and stores at both ofc) and easy to Osaka Castle.  

Not a ton of American tourists, so it felt more authentic for the most part. A lot of domestic and Asian tourists. 

Would likely stay again. Overall rating 7.5

1h2anhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianDating/comments/1h2anhu/28_m_us_northeastanywhere_trying_to_find_someone/,"28 M, US (Northeast)/Anywhere - Trying to Find Someone Special","Hi all (Warning: long post),

As the title says I'm looking for someone special. My Christian journey has lead me to want to be a full time missionary, and I've found this makes dating very hard as you might be able to imagine. Given that my calling is quite restrictive, I'm looking online for others who might share this calling or have an openness to God's leading. 

Doctrine is very important to me as a missionary, and I would like to find someone who is broadly aligned with me on core doctrine. It's important to me that my future wife be a conservative reformed Christian. I hold to all 5 points of Calvinism, as I believe it is the most faithful interpretation of Scripture (no hate, just how I see it. If you hate Calvinism or reformed theology don't reply). I am a member of a Baptist Church and hold to theological positions that are Baptist distinctives. If you're not a Baptist that's ok, but please do be reformed in general (I have a lot of love and respect for my Presbyterian friends and others who are non denominational etc). 

I would also ideally like to find someone who understands the beautiful design for the family that God has laid out in the Bible for the family (think traditional gender roles and Lord willing bigger families). Someone who loves kids is essential for sure, as well as someone who understands that complementarianism is the biblical prescription for life and the church. I've always been a provider/protector type and I hope to find someone who appreciates that and embraces her feminine gifts in a way that honors and glorifies God. Many people talk about a Proverbs 31 woman, but I think we should add Titus 2 to that as well. 

If you're still here, here's a little more info about me. 

I was saved a little over 4 years ago, and have experienced a rapid growth in Christ. Early on I found myself feeling strongly called to missions, and I am now on that path and working to be sent by my church as a full time missionary (I'll tell you where in DMs). As it says in my title, I'm 28, single, no kids, never married. 

My hobbies include golf, coffee (if you're with me you will have the best coffee you have ever had), writing, reading (I love reading about history but I also listen to science fiction or fantasy audiobooks), skiing, the gym, cooking, a few games and anime on the rare occasions I have time to play. 

I work in IT currently and though I have a thriving career, I'm happy to give it up for my ministry. I also serve in various roles in my local church. 

I'm 5'7, white, brown hair, hazel eyes, and in decent shape. I'm very much the clean cut type. 

Age range: 18-30

I'm totally open to long distance, but I'm the US and outside. I love learning about other cultures so if you are from another country please teach me something about your culture and how life is like for Christians there. Missiology is one of my favorite subjects so I'd love to hear more about your story and people. 

If most or all of this applies to you I would love to get to know you. I know that this post may seem very picky, but I think it's warranted given that missions is a very specific and difficult calling. This life is not for the faint of heart, and if you're not at least open to going down that path, we unfortunately will not be a match since for me to decorate from this path would be to disobey our Lord. I also think this is the most important decision we will ever make besides following Christ, so I always date with serious intention (though that doesn't mean I don't know how to have fun and be spontaneous). 

Well this post turned into a long essay, so if you somehow got all the way through this, let me know because you're probably the one I'm looking for. Thanks for reading. ",3,1732843808.0,ChristianDating,1,1.0,False

Arrived around 4 without a reservation and was able to get a spot at the bar (my preference). I’ve been once before, with a group, for Sunday roast. 

I got the Prime Rib Roast thanksgiving special ($68) — all the usual Sunday roast trimmings but with a nice slice of prime rib.  The carrots, roasted garlic & cabbage were outstanding.  I honestly have no notes.  The Yorkshire pudding was good but maybe not the most stellar Yorkshire I’ve ever had.  The prime rib was delicious and the whole thing was just the right proportions.  

I also got a few drinks: the Finder’s Keeper cocktail, a glass of Pinot Blanco and a Hawksmoor Irish Coffee after dessert.  All really well made — definitely would recommend the Irish coffee, it was perfect balance of sweet and espresso. 

For dessert I got the coconut passion fruit pavlova, which was an ideal balance to my starchy meal.  I’m not really into chocolate or toffee pudding and this was the only lighter/fruity dessert.  I had to stop myself from licking the plate. 

Service was fantastic — the bartenders were so helpful and major shout out to Katie for such excellent service.  

Definitely looking forward to coming back again and trying other menu items.  Great atmosphere — not too loud and comfortable seating.

I set it up according to the instructions, but when I tried making any milk-based drink (Cappacino, Latte macchiato, My latte) no milk would come out of the frother--just steam. I was using whole milk, which I assumed would be fine since the manual said whole milk was okay; but I noticed the Troubleshooting section of the manual also mentioned that if the milk is ""under-frothed"" to ensure 1. it's cold enough (it was--straight from the fridge), and, otherwise, to try 2. skim or semi-skimmed milk. 

So I tried skim milk instead but noticed the three milk-based drink buttons weren't illuminated, which led me to this [paper towel over the sensor](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeLonghi/comments/z4j3f4/comment/kvrgddh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). I tried that and, sure enough, suddenly the frother was working and distributing the frothed milk into the coffee cup.

I'd prefer to use whole milk, though (and would also prefer not having to do the paper towel trick every time, which seems necessary with skim milk). Has anyone had any luck using whole milk with this machine? The manual says to ""try another brand"", but I'm skeptical another whole milk brand will fare better.

1h2adkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTherapist/comments/1h2adkr/please_help/,please help,"I am seeking help from the community. Doctors seem to either not know what to diagnose him with, or say different theories. Therapists have said that they are unable to continue progressive work with him. We don't know what to do next and are scared of doing the wrong things.



I am the older brother (26) writing about my younger brother (19). Before I set up the story and get into the details, I want to prioritize some observations about him to keep in mind when reading the post. I am not a doctor nor is my mom.



My younger  brother was always zoning out in times growing up. He did have friends as a child but struggled to participate in things that require human interaction and people skills. He was signed up for so many activities and did not object to any. Today we find him spending his time staring at walls. To give you an idea, he can stay in bed the entire day and do nothing. I mean nothing. He can be on a 14 hour flight and stare in his seat and do nothing, not even use the bathroom. Staring in front of him with no tv, no game, no book. We try to offer him a movie to watch or something to do but he chooses not to. No interest in movies, music, exercise, nothing. He can go hours even days without eating unless my mother makes him food and asks him to eat. He has virtually no interest and no hobbies and hasn't had a friend for 5 years. He pulls his phone out in social situations just to scroll left and right on his homepage. He doesn't actually do anything on it. We think it's to reduce some form of anxiety when in public or with people in general. He is silent in conversation and doesn't talk unless being talked to, even then he replies with. Maybe, sometimes, yes, no, kinda and essentially one word answers. He is slow at processing and moving from one activity to the other. To get him out of the house can take hours, to get him out of the car can also be hours. He lives in an extreme denial of his life that he is okay and can do well in all situations, while on the other hand he seems that he is extremely hard on himself. It almost seems like he has to put on a strong front with a lot of pride in order to cope with the lack of ability to obtain a job, do well in school, and socialize. He blacks out at times of high anxiety and stress. He doesn't remember hitting me or calling my mom names. (more of this portion later)



My little brother lives with my mom and her boyfriend. Her boyfriend is extremely nice and sweet and will never get in between them or try and raise my younger brother. My mother loves him extremely and can suffocate him at times with being at his every need. I can't blame her given that if she doesn't cook every meal then he simply won't eat. My little brother does not do what he is told, it almost seems that he is not capable at simple tasks. Like his mind is his own prison that restricts him from doing anything that he wants to do. He always says he will do something and ends up not. Examples are when he is asked to go outside for 30 min he says he will later and on his own time but finds himself in his bed instead. My mother does everything to get him out of bed, she works minimal hours so she can be present and revolves her life around him. She can do this due to having money saved up. He has had some small wins like getting a drivers license, starting school at a community college and spending time with a group of friends for an hour a week at an organized event. He does great at his math classes but fails his english classes. He lies about going to the guidance counselor and talking about classes next term as he is lost and doesn't know how to navigate college yet wont ask for help. It took me an entire day of pulling teeth to get him to show me his English grade that he said he was receiving a good grade and ended up not submitting the past 15 assignments and having a 47%. Interesting thing is he submitted the first 15 or so assignments and was receiving good grades, then he stopped all of a sudden. It seems that he lacks motivation in life for practically anything. It seems that he is paralyzed by his anxiety to do anything. Yet when I ask him questions about situations that he froze in, he wants to be left alone and laughs at it and lies that it was for a made up reason. I asked him if he felt nervous, or if his heart rate went up, or why he changed his mind. He seems to be disconnected from his emotions completely.



My part. I have an opposite approach than my mother. My father has not been much a part of his life from year 14 to present day. My father set boundaries and limitations while my mother struggled to. When I talk to my mom I try to explain to her that she must set boundaries, otherwise he will never achieve any independence or happiness. He will continue to stay put in his comfortable situation, rather than take chances and risks to expand his life. I tell him that he must show his mother his grades at school, that he needs to go outside at times. I am scared this feeds into his low self esteem and ends up hurting him more, but I don't know what to do otherwise. I want to recognize he has something but we don't know what it is. We have had professionals say he is not depressed or anxious while others said he is both. We have had professionals say he has a form of autism, while others say he does not. I try to get my mother to force a healthy routine in his life of what he is capable of, with consequences. Thing is we can't give him any since he has nothing in his life he values that we could take from him. He is 19 but I can't get my mother to give him the consequence of sleeping outside. She doesn't have it in her. I do but I know that if I force this when I am around and my mother doesn't then it won't solve anything. Rather it would do more harm than good. I dont stay with my mothers long enough to instill positive behavior and routine.



When I push him. When I push him too hard he can blow up. This has only happened a few times. Ex: I came to visit during the summer and we drove two hours to a specific hike on 100 degree day. He wanted to stay in the car and I was not having it. He ended up blowing up and hitting me while he was screaming ‘just hit me already’ yet I have never hit him in my adult life. As kids we played rough at times but even then I would take his hits and rarely hit him back or retaliate. During these times of stress his entire body goes berserk. He slams doors, sprints away, breathes heavily, screams at the top of his lungs and his face goes to anger. He blacks out and doesn't remember any of these events. 



Lies and argumentative. Pretty self explanatory. Even when caught red handed he denies it with all his ability. It almost seems like he views as the world against him. He plays on my moms emotions to get what he wants. He makes her feel bad for him so he can be left alone and not do the things he say he will do that would be good for him.



I had a talk with him about exposure therapy. Since he couldnt get the courage to walk up and ask for a job, I ask him to go buy a coffee for me so he talks with the person at the counter. He laughs and says that he can do it and that its easy. Yet I try to reason with him saying that when we went to costco so he could ask for a job he didnt pull through with it. Thats why we need to start small. He seemed to tense up and ask me questions like what exactly should I say. I tell him to order a small black coffee, as a way to keep it simple. He asks me if the lady will ask him any more questions afterwords. I told him she might ask if he wants sugar and to say no to that question. We needed to go over this a few times in order to prep him. He ended up completing this and I praised him for it. Yet when i praised him for it he shrugged it off like it was nothing and it was a joke. That he easily could have done it. I give him genuin compliments at times and he turns it around like im making fun of him, when I give him pointers to be successful he takes it as criticism instead.



Doesnt open up. Not to my mom, me or any therapist he has ever talked to. Which is why therapists stop working with him since they cant make progress.



A bit more about him and his life. My family moved around a lot. Including myself but him most since he was 7 years younger than me. Always new environment, new friends, new cultures. When he was younger he was laughing and joking and playful. He played piano and was really good at it. He played sports growing up including water polo and soccer. He spent time with friends and me and him have always had a close relationship. When I left the house at 18 and he was 11 things seemed fine. I went through drug addiction and got clean at 22. My sister had her tantrums growing up and left at 17. My father and mother split when i was 22 and he was 15. I didnt notice any of the bad blood between them, but it started to escalate a year or so after I left the house around the time I was most deep into my addiction. During this time I believe my little brother was neglected. I spent years raising him as a teenager since my father spent his time traveling for work. He was essentially left alone all of a sudden, with parents who fought regularly and no one to turn to. Given his character we also think he may have been bullied at school. We never found out through him. Around this time is when he closed up. 



Medication: recently he started taking an ssri. Otherwise nothing.

Millie Bobby Brown is only 20 yet she’s already married has written a book, has a clothing, make up, and coffee line. Star in numerous movies. Finn Wolfhard is a successful actor, he’s directed a film, and is in a band. Tom Holland is so young and the star of numerous films, also has a theater career, and a non-alcoholic brand. Bridgit Mendler was a Disney Channel star, had a music career, now has a PhD. Went to MIT and Harvard. Married, adopted a child and now owns a space company.

Sure, everybody has their own path, but seeing someone way younger than you fly past, the finish line still stings, especially when it feels like you’ll never accomplish a fraction of what they have. ",1,1732842759.0,NoStupidQuestions,12,1.0,False

A friend recommended to me the Breville Barista Pro, though after doing some research on this sub, there seems to be a stronger preference to have separate grinders and espresso machines rather than an integrated machine, such as the Breville Barista Pro, where it seems the quality of the integrated grinders are not as good?

**Requirements**

* Making three to four milky coffees per day (two double shots for me and one to two singles for the wife) and iced coffees in the summer.
* Ability to dive into settings changes to refine our pulls.
* Coffee simplicity for the wife, i.e. not too complicated to process her daily brew. Wife sometimes likes a decaf as well.
   * How good is the auto-milk on the bambino plus compared to manually heating milk? The wife likes the one button push for hot milk but she can still use the aeroccino we have (like the heathen she is). This is not essential if there is a better machine without auto-milk or if manual milk is significantly better.
* I'm in Australia, and here's a list of machine and grinder options I have been considering are below.

**Espresso Machines**

* Breville Bambino
* Breville Bambino Plus
* Breville Barista Express
* Breville Barista Pro

**Grinders**

* DF54
* VS3
* DF64
* Niche Zero (whilst popular, its outside my budget by itself).

I'd be happy to consider other machine grinder options provided its within the budget.

Lastly, two other questions I have.

* Besides the machine and grinder, are there any tools / gadgets that you think are **essential** to the coffee process I should consider?
* Are there any tools / gadgets that you think are completely **NON-essential** to the coffee process I should consider?",1,1732842755.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

This strategy has attracted a consumer base that is increasingly concerned about environmental impact.

# Product Diversification and Market Expansion

Starbucks Corporation has been on a path of diversification and expansion that goes beyond its traditional coffee. While coffee remains at the core of its offering, the company has expanded its portfolio to include a variety of beverages such as teas, frappuccinos, and plant-based options, as well as food ranging from baked goods to healthy and vegetarian options.

Its research and development efforts, focused on improving customer experience and sustainability, reinforce its long-term commitment to consumers and the environment.

# Starbucks Competition

Despite this intense competition, Starbucks has maintained its leadership through its focus on customer experience, brand loyalty, and ability to innovate in products and services. Its ability to adapt to local tastes and its constant pursuit of sustainable practices give it a competitive advantage that has been critical to its global success.

Its commitment to customizable options, the use of technology in its operations, and expansion into markets where coffee is booming have allowed it to consolidate its position in the industry. Starbucks continues to improve its distribution and service network, adapting to local preferences without losing its global essence, allowing it to reach a diverse and loyal customer base.

# Global Market Capitalization

With a global presence and a considerable market capitalization, Starbucks not only maintains a strong position against its competitors, but also continues to set trends in the coffee and food industry. Its ability to adapt to local markets, while maintaining a consistent brand image committed to sustainability, allows it to withstand pressure from its competitors and position itself as a leader in the global market.

# Starbucks Corporation Financial Summary

[For the full fiscal year 2024](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/q3/3Q24-Earnings-Release-Final-7-30-24.pdf) , Starbucks Corporation faced a challenging environment that impacted its financial performance, highlighting the need to adjust its strategy and enhance the customer experience. For the year, global comparable store sales decreased 2%, while net revenue increased slightly by 1%, reaching $36.2 billion, driven in part by growth in average ticket value and price increases.

**Highlights:**

* **Revenue Performance:** In the fourth quarter, Starbucks net revenue decreased 3% to $9.1 billion, due to a 7% decrease in global comparable store sales. In the United States, comparable store sales decreased 6%, impacted by a 10% decline in transactions, partially mitigated by a 4% increase in ticket values. In China, comparable store sales decreased 14%, reflecting a challenging macroeconomic environment.
* **Operating Margin:** The fourth quarter operating margin decreased to 16.7%, impacted by higher investments in employee benefits and salaries, as well as promotional activities. This decrease was partially offset by operational efficiencies in stores and price adjustments.
* **Earnings per Share (EPS):** Earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.80, representing a 25% decrease compared to the prior year. For the full year, EPS reached $3.31, a decrease of 8% from the prior fiscal year.
* **Initiatives and Recovery Plan:** In order to boost its long-term growth, Starbucks launched its “Back to Starbucks” plan, an initiative to return to the fundamentals that have always characterized the brand, such as coffee quality and in-store experience. This plan includes optimizing operations during the morning peaks and a review of its pricing and menu strategy to simplify the offer and attract more customers.

# SUMMARY

Starbucks Corporation remains an interesting option for investors seeking exposure to the global consumer sector. Despite recent challenges, the company continues to show resilience thanks to its global expansion strategy, strong loyalty program, and ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences.

Recent initiatives, such as the “Back to Starbucks” plan, reflect the company’s commitment to refocus its strategy and return to its core, which could help restore sustained growth. In addition, the diversification of its product portfolio and the continued expansion of its digital sales channels offer significant opportunities for the future.

Although there are associated risks, such as slowdowns in key markets and rising operating costs, Starbucks has proven to be a strong brand that adapts to market changes. For investors looking for stability and long-term growth opportunities in the consumer sector, Starbucks stock presents an attractive proposition.
