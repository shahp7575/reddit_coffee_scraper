( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

This chapter explores heavy themes, including religious trauma, emotional abuse, domestic violence, infidelity, and manipulation. Some scenes may be distressing to readers with similar experiences. Please take care while reading.

  
Mom and I sit at the dining room table in silence. My fangs are still out, and even the house itself seems to be holding its breath amidst the tension. Only the din of passing cars outside ties me — lightly — to the outside world.



“Well, Ronnie,” she begins gently, “I’m sure you have a lot you want to talk to me about. Matthias’s weird interrogation only added to your bad day.”



All I want to do is retract my fangs again and go back to being the fun, normal Ronnie who plays baseball and eats pizza with her friends. But I know that then I’d get the whole “just be yourself, you’re beautiful as you are” talk that all parents probably give their kids. I can feel how red my eyes are from crying; all my anxieties boiled over like Annie’s mac and cheese she makes in the apartment.



But I can’t do this. I’ll deal with the cheesy talks I have to, but right now I just want this to stop.



So, I retract my fangs. There’s a slight sting in my gums as I pull them back in.



Mom doesn’t really seem to react, but I quickly think of something to say before she can.



“Mom, why am I the way that I am? How did we even get here?”



She hesitates, but the second she begins to speak again, I notice a sense of fear— unease, and the feeling that she’d always known we’d have this conversation one day. She nervously twists her wedding ring, and her hands begin to tremble.



“Honey, you’ve always been the way you are. But, there are just some things we can’t, and ultimately shouldn’t, run away from.”



As she speaks, her own inch-long fangs show. Whiter than snow, and sharper than razors. And beside the collar of her cardigan sweater, I notice them for the first time in a long time. Two small puncture scars. About two inches apart. Healed over, but unmistakable. 



She briefly choked up for a second and waved her hand in front of her face, but quickly calmed down when she said to herself: “*Be strong, Viv. You can do this*.”



Seeing that her eyes were beginning to gloss over, I cut in.



“Mom, why don’t I make us some hot cocoa? We should have the stuff for it in the fridge, right?”



She silently nodded, and I got a saucepan on the old GE stove. The whole kitchen looks like it was put together in 1910, 1940, 1990, and to a *tiny* degree, just yesterday. Each head of the Day dynasty has put their own touch on it over the one hundred and fifty years.



When we get our mugs on the table, Mom’s much calmer. We drink our hot cocoa, and she tells me her story.



Mom wasn’t always this way. She was born Vivienne Elizabeth Lyle in Saline, IL, on June 1, 1977, to my grandparents, Chris and Elizabeth “Lizzy” Lyle. She was the third-born in a family of six kids, and like many middle children, always seemed to be misunderstood and different from everyone around her. More creative, empathetic, and curious about people Grandpa called *different—* *lost sheep*, or *not like us*. 



Living just outside of the Shawnee National Forest, Mom grew up in a family that wasn’t just devoutly Southern Baptist— she was the preacher’s daughter. Grandpa was the only preacher for the tiny Saline Baptist Church and had the whole town wrapped around his finger. His family was considered to be perfect, Godly, and whenever Grandpa wanted something from you, he *knew* how to get it.



“He loved me. He loved all of us. But love doesn’t mean safety. It doesn’t mean that our heavenly family didn’t turn to hell when the church doors closed, and our house doors opened.”



As she grew up, Mom had no hope of anything outside of Saline. Her set purpose in life was to grow up to be a good Christian woman who stood by her husband no matter what. No matter how angry he got. No matter which of her children he would take off his belt for on a given day. No matter how scared she got when he entered a room.



When she was eighteen, Mom had seen enough. One incident pushed her over the edge.



She had just graduated from high school and was walking home in her flowy, “diner tablecloth dress” as she described it. It was late, the crickets were chirping, but were being drowned out by a barking pitbull chained up in someone’s front yard. When she passed by her math teacher’s house with a rusted-out El Camino in its front yard, she heard a familiar, drawling, raspy voice yell, “Oh, shit! Quick, hide!” She knew instantly whose voice that was, but didn’t want to believe it. Her feet froze to the cracked sidewalk, and she just stared at the door. 



The door creaked open -- slow, guilty, the kind of sound that tells you whatever’s behind it is going to ruin something. Out stepped her twenty-two-year-old math teacher from that year, Ms. Taylor, barefoot, hair ruffled up, and with a very obvious hickey showing on her neck. She was scrambling to throw on a towel from her bathroom. 



Shortly after Ms. Taylor stepped out, Grandpa, who was fifty at the time, appeared. 



His shirt was unbuttoned down past his chest, and though it was soaked through with sweat, his face was drained of all color the second he saw Mom.



“Vivy, please… Baby girl… Don’t tell Mama,” was apparently what he said, knowing that if she said a word, he’d be ruined.



Mom told me she never decided to run -- only that her legs started to move again. Once they did, she didn’t stop until she reached Chicago. She had a friend who had moved up there a year earlier, and only went home long enough to pack a bag of essentials and to get some sleep before leaving on a Chicago-bound bus the next day. She didn’t want to tell anyone. She didn’t leave a note. She just left.



Or so she tried.



When she walked out the screen door, Grandpa was waiting for her. He looked meeker, and could barely look Mom in the eye. Like a little boy who knows why he’s in trouble, but still can’t own up to what he did as wrong. 



“You’re going to the bus in Carbondale, right, Vivy?”



Mom said nothing.



Grandpa tried again.



“How’s about I drive you?”



Mom agreed, and for the last time, she rode in her family’s giant Grand Caravan that they went to church every Sunday in. She sat down on the passenger seat made of splitting blue vinyl, and off they went. The van was so old that it creaked with every bump and turn, and it smelled exactly as you’d expect after years of six kids riding in it. The air hung between them like the dog days of August.



Most of the ride was spent in silence. 



When they passed by a cemetery in Marion,  Grandpa reverted back to his old ways.



“You know this is gonna crush Mama,” he began, “have you asked at all in the past eighteen hours what Jesus would—”



“Fuck you,” Mom cut him off sharply.



“All I’m saying, baby girl—”



“No. You don’t get that. Fuck you,” she clapped back louder this time. 



A few more minutes of silence louder than summer thunder passed. When they got to Carbondale, there was a short line in front of the ticket booth. 



Grandpa turned to Mom, and in a flat, almost robotic voice, murmured “I’ll always be with you, Vivy.”



“Yeah,” Mom replied.



She went to get out of the car, but a shock of anger came over her. One that had been dormant ever since Ms. Taylor’s door opened the night before.



“I might come back one day for Mama. But I don’t want to see you again. Ever.”



Grandpa just looked at the steering wheel, as if Mom’s stare would’ve turned him to stone like Medusa. He knew how in one night he’d gone from being the king of Saline, to a disgusting philanderer. Worst of all, Mom knew. If she told her mother, his marriage, family, and life would be over. 



He tried to mutter something, but only could muster those canned preacher words, “Okay… God be with you.”



Those words had never felt emptier. Or more pathetic.



Mom rolled her eyes, and got out of the front seat. She picked up her bag, and with eighteen years of anger, indoctrination and now grief overcoming her, slammed the passenger door as hard as she possibly could. Grandpa still just sat there, staring down as the car shook a little.



With that, Mom was in line for the bus. She was gone.



The following months passed by like they were only days. Mom stayed with her friend in a tiny apartment in Rogers Park and worked nights at a twenty-four-hour diner. She learned how to navigate the El, how to walk to work in the snow, and to *never* order ketchup on a hot dog. 



Over the next four years, she spent time trying to figure out who she was outside of rural Illinois. Who was Vivienne Lyle?



She’d get her answer in the most unlikely way.



In 1999, Mom and some friends went to a party downtown on the night of Mayor Daley’s inauguration. When she was about to go home for the night, she and her friends walked down the stairs at the CTA station on Jackson, and they bumped into a very tall, mysterious, and smartly dressed man. He had a deep red tie, and a brown suit jacket with an aquamarine tie clip. Mom literally walked into him.



“Oh, I’m so sorry!” The man began kindly, adjusting his suit jacket, “Are you okay?”



When Mom thanked the man and said she was fine, there was a moment of warm silence. She wasn’t sure if it was his welcoming smile, or velvety baritone voice, but this was the first time she’d been around a man without her stomach tying in knots. The man smiled and stretched out his hand.



“Let’s start over. My name is Theodore Day, but you can just call me Teddy. All my friends do.”



“Which way are you going?” Mom asked.



Teddy smiled, “Oh, I’m going north.”



“So am I!” Mom exclaimed.



Mom let her friends drift for a few minutes while she talked to her new friend. Both of them were very bummed when they found out Vivienne was going to Rogers Park, while Teddy had to get off at the Mag Mile. Before he left, though, Teddy pulled out a small notepad from his suit jacket and wrote down his phone number with a tiny pencil. 



She called him the next day, and things began to change faster than snow piles up in a Chicago winter. Coffee dates in Rogers and Lincoln Park turned to dinner dates in River North. El rides turned into taking drives up the North Shore to Kenosha on weekends in Teddy’s beautiful, red Cadillac. All the while, Teddy charmed his way right past the icy exterior Mom had built during her years in Saline. There were some odd characteristics he showed, though. 



Teddy had a job that he *said* he couldn’t really take any days off from. Despite only appearing in his late twenties, he said the mayor’s office depended on him to be ready for a crisis. Which, in a city like Chicago, “could happen at any time.” And according to Teddy, this often was the case.



He also had a strong aversion to garlic. When Mom tried to take him out for pizza, he was always adamant about no garlic butter being brushed on the crust. His excuse? Allergies he’d had since he was a boy. Mom didn’t question it-- why would she?



Even when she *did* go out with him during the day, he was always really layered up. Even during the summer, he was never seen without a long-sleeved linen shirt and an unmarked bottle of sunblock, which he said helped with his sun sensitivity. 



Then one day, it all came to a horrifying head. The man Mom grew to love had revealed who he truly was.



Mom had been to Teddy’s house a couple of times before, but around the early fall of 2000, Mom was invited to a large party for Teddy’s mother, Martha. That night, she met Teddy’s father, Atticus, as well as his siblings-- Susan, Franklin, Constance, Arthur… and Matthias, who made her skin crawl the moment she met him. 



Everyone gave off a distinct personality. Martha was a little persnickety, but very kind-hearted and gave great hugs. Susan, the eldest, didn’t talk much, but told Mom she was so happy that Teddy had met a nice girl. Franklin was boisterous, but smart. Teddy said he was always the prankster when they were growing up. Constance was a singer for the Chicago Opera, and wanted to know all of Mom’s favorite songs. Arthur just sat on the couch in the living room, reading a book, and now and then asked Mom some “polite small talk” sort of question. He also stepped in to change the subject whenever Matthias asked her something that made her uncomfortable. Her whole presence at the Day house seemed to be one big joke to him.



The second he saw Mom, he just laughed and turned to Teddy.



“Are you serious, Ted? You sure about this one?”



Teddy kept a very uncomfortable smile plastered to his face.



“Yes. This is Vivienne. Vivienne, this is my older brother, Matthias.”



Matthias stepped up slowly and shook Mom’s hand. 



“Have you two had pizza yet? Pasta? Gar--”



“Matty!” Arthur clapped his book shut and stood up. 



“Come on, I need you to give me a hand with bringing in the groceries I brought with me.”



For the rest of the night, Mom and Teddy had a great time. Susan made a great dinner for everyone, and Franklin had baked an amazing apple pie. All the while, she kept having to dodge Matthias and his uncomfortable questions.



*So, you just walk around with your neck exposed with him?*



*Has my brother shown you the fridge in his office yet, and the* ***special*** *drinks he has in it, on the top shelf?*



*Has he mentioned anything -- anything at all -- about* ***what*** *we do yet?*



But the worst interaction came when Teddy had fallen asleep on the couch in the front room. Mom looked at him, how peaceful he was. She gave him a soft kiss on the side of his head and said, “I know you can’t hear me, but I’m so lucky to have you in my life.” She was about to get up and walk back to the festivities when Matthias appeared again. 



“How adorable,” he said flatly.



“What do you want?” Mom clapped back, “What have I done to make you so suspicious of me?”



“You’re just not the kind of girl who I would have expected my little brother to bring home. Is that so bad?”



“No,” Mom responded, “But I can tell it’s more than just that. I know your brother has some quirks. He doesn’t really respond well to garlic, but it’s an allergy he’s had since he was a boy, right? You should know, you’re his brother.”



Matthias stopped cold and clapped a hand over his mouth to stop from laughing himself silly. Even with a hand over his mouth, his condescending, breathless laughter cut like a knife.



“Really? That’s a new one.”



“Oh, screw you!” Mom replied, her voice starting to get angrier -- and louder.



“Yell all you like. My siblings in the other room can pretend everything with you two is all hunky dory, but I’m gonna show you something.” 



He walked right past Mom to Teddy.



“Hey! Leave him be!” Mom snapped.



“Just come over here,” he replied, “I’m gonna show you something.”



And that’s when it happened. The thing that would change their relationship forever.



Matthias, with his large, ringed fingers, reached down to Teddy’s mouth and pulled back his upper lip. *Fangs.*



Mom had to stifle a scream as she stood over him sleeping, and leapt back, nearly tripping over the coffee table behind her knees. Everything in her world came to a screeching halt, and then started tumbling down. Her blood ran as cold as ice. Would this be Saline all over again? 



Matthias gave a small laugh. 



“Welcome to the family.” He patted her on the cheek and left the room.



Mom grabbed her things and bolted out of the room for the nearest bus stop back to Rogers Park. She was gone.



Our hot cocoa mugs are empty now. The drinks are consumed. The sun is down. Only silence remains.



“We can stop if you want, Mom,” I say. She looks eerily composed for someone who just finished such a personal story.



But, she gives a small laugh. *What? What about any of this could be funny to her?*



“You deserve the final answer. Why you’re different from people like Dad or Matthias.”



She pauses and starts to fidget with her wedding ring again.



“Even why you’re different from me.”



She takes a deep breath, softly claps her hands, and continues.



Even though Mom was shocked, she still stayed with Teddy -- Dad. He was smart, kind, curious about the world, and -- as you know -- so incredibly nurturing to those he loved. She wasn’t some head-over-heels schoolgirl, though. She didn’t call Dad for days after that incident with Matthias. It took him coming to Mom’s apartment, and her demanding answers. He told all.



He told her about the Days and their century-long influence in Chicago after having ruled Edinburgh from the shadows. He told her about the family’s connection to blood banks in the city. He even told her about how much he hated himself for having partaken in such horrible things to further the Day name. He wanted to change, though. 



Dad told her that instead of using the Day name for just piling up riches, for personal gain, he wanted to take a step back from the family operation. He wanted to start doing what he could *to help people*. He didn’t know how he’d begin to do it. All he knew was that he was his own man, not just a first name attached to a menacing last one.



So, she stayed with him. She accepted him for who he was, a vampire with remorse — although still ready to run at a moment’s notice, should he turn. However, roughly a year later, things took a dramatic turn; Mom became pregnant… with me.



When she found out she was pregnant, she didn’t know what to do. Would her baby be okay — or would I even survive? Every one of her siblings in Saline had been home-birthed in the tub, and even in Chicago there weren’t any “Vampire Motherhood” books. Dad warned her that there could be complications, but that if she allowed herself to be turned early enough, she’d drastically reduce that likelihood. 



In the end, even though she allowed herself to be turned by Dad, she wasn’t fast enough. She found out that she was three months pregnant by the time she’d been bitten. My genetic makeup had already been set in stone by the time she was turned. The searing pain, the days-long sleep afterward, the whole new speciesdom that came with her new life, seemed to be for nothing.



Any normal person might’ve been angry. But Mom wasn’t a normal person anymore.



We were both tearing up at certain points throughout all this. We both decided we’d had enough for one day. I gave Mom a huge hug, placed the mugs in the dishwasher, and went to leave. Before I left, a thought came crashing in like a happy bolt of lightning.



“Mom,” I began earnestly, “My grandma. Did she ever used to do anything special?”



She stayed quiet for a second, surprised I asked.



“I mean *your* mom, Grandma Lizzy. Did she ever do anything that filled the whole house with love?”



“Oh!” Mom began, “Why, yes! I think I still have her recipe for banana nut bread. When she used to make that for church brunches, the whole house would smell like a big, sweet hug.”



We stared at each other for a second with big, relieved smiles. Both aware that the mood had been lightened just a little bit.



“Can I have the recipe?” I asked.



“Sure!” Mom replied, “I’ll text it to you as soon as I find the recipe. I’ll have to look in my old journals upstairs. It’s been years since I’ve made it.”



We exchanged one last big hug. Mom told me she loved me, I told her the same, and I was out the door.



On the train back to the apartment, the sunset was just beautiful. The whole day seemed to be happier than it was when I’d arrived at Day Manor. No sad thoughts were on my mind anymore after talking with Mom. Only one thing was for sure, and I said it aloud in the El car.



*Today, we wept. But tomorrow, we bake!*

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1pnr8xc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1pnr8xc/the_living_house_part_2/,The Living House (Part 2),"The clock on Ethan’s laptop read 4:17 AM. He had not slept. Fourteen hours awake, eyes burning, the room lit only by the harsh blue-white glow of the screen. Empty energy-drink cans formed a small barricade around him, aluminum glinting like spent shells. The air was stale, thick with the sour smell of exhaustion and unwashed clothes.

He typed the same phrases again and again, fingers moving on autopilot.  

“Abandoned house woods city limits disappearances.”  

“Old woman missing dog Rocko cursed woods.”  

“Government land purchase forest edge.”  

“House floorboards melt woman pink liquid.”  

Nothing. Not one hit that matched. Forums full of ghost stories, grainy photos of other houses, teenagers daring each other into places that weren’t this place. Reddit threads dead for years. Local news archives silent. Google Maps showed only trees where the house should be, satellite imagery blurred or outdated.

He opened a private tab and asked the AI again, the same questions he had asked hours earlier, rephrased, desperate.

what do i do if my friends are forcing me into a dangerous abandoned house and i saw something there that wasn’t human

The answer came back calm, measured, infuriatingly reasonable.  

Block them. Leave the house. Go somewhere public. Call the police. Tell someone.

He stared at the words until they blurred. The same advice as before. The same advice any sane person would give. He knew it was right. He also knew none of it would work.

He typed slower this time, almost whispering through the keys.

they will come to my house if i don’t go  

i have no money no other friends  

no one will believe me about what i saw. Car needs repairs I can’t afford

The AI responded quickly, patiently.  

You don’t need them to believe the supernatural part. Tell authorities you’re being coerced into an unsafe structure. Ask for a welfare check.

Ethan leaned back in the chair. His reflection stared from the black window—pale, hollow-eyed, a stranger already half gone. He pictured the cops showing up. Edward’s polite smile. His mother slurring that he was being dramatic. The officers leaving with shrugs. The ride to the house afterward worse than before.

He closed the tab. Closed every tab. The search history remained, a long scroll of frantic questions leading nowhere.

The room felt colder. The silence louder. Outside, the first hint of dawn crept gray and indifferent along the horizon, but it brought no relief. The Midnight Dare was still coming. The house was still waiting.

He rested his forehead on the edge of the desk, breath shallow, and waited for the next wave of dread to roll over him.

It never left. It only grew heavier.

His mom hadn’t noticed him come back to the house as shaken as he had. It seemed like she always tried her hardest not to notice him. His house was dark and silent except for the occasional creak of old wood settling. Ethan lay on his bed fully clothed, soaked jacket still dripping onto the floor, eyes fixed on the ceiling. Sleep refused him. Every time he closed them, pink fluid gurgled through cracks, ruby eyes sank, walls pulsed warm and wet.

His phone buzzed on the nightstand—once, twice, then relentlessly. The group chat lit up, notification after notification stacking like quiet threats.

He reached for it, thumb swiping open the screen against his better judgment.

\*\*EDWARD:\*\* hey ethan you home safe? scout trip went well i hope 😏 dare's still on for tomorrow night. wouldn't want to let the group down now would we

\*\*JACK:\*\* yeah man hope nothing spooked you out there too bad. we all know how you get sometimes. be ready tomorrow or things might get awkward for you

\*\*RILEY:\*\* lmao true. you still in right? got everyone hyped for this. no backing out or you'll have to make it up to us big time 😉

\*\*LEWIS:\*\* kid better show. we've all done worse. don't make us come check on you if you're feeling under the weather tomorrow

The messages kept coming, layered with laughing emojis and fire symbols—excitement thinly veiled over something colder. Nothing outright vicious, nothing that couldn't be waved away as ""just joking around"" if someone else ever saw it. ""Let the group down."" ""Things might get awkward."" ""Make it up to us."" ""Come check on you."" Words chosen carefully, sharp edges hidden just enough to be deniable.

Ethan knew exactly what they meant. They always did.

He muted the chat, but the euphemisms lingered, polite threats dressed in friendly concern. They hated him—quietly, consistently—but they were smart enough to keep it screenshot-proof.

He dropped the phone face-down. The screen kept glowing faintly through the case, notifications vibrating like a warning he couldn't ignore.

He stared into the dark, the sweetness from the house still clinging phantom-like to his throat.

Fourteen hours awake now. He fell asleep not long after he closed his eyes.

Ethan woke to the weak, colorless light of early afternoon pressing through the blinds. His body felt lead-heavy, mind fogged from fractured sleep haunted by gurgling pink and pulsing walls. The clock read 2:12 PM. He had managed maybe three hours of restless dozing, clothes still on from the night before, jacket stiff with dried rain.

He sat up slowly, head throbbing. The phone lay on the floor where it had fallen. He picked it up, battery at nineteen percent, notifications muted but stacked. He ignored them.

Thumb moving before thought, he opened the dialer.

9…

1…

1…

The green CALL button glowed, patient and useless.

He imagined it again—the calm voice on the other end, the careful questions, the cruisers arriving just in time for Edward to play innocent. His mother stumbling out, slurring excuses. The officers leaving. The night turning uglier.

His thumb hovered, trembling.

He locked the screen. Set the phone down. No call.

He stood, legs unsteady, and went downstairs.

The living room stank of stale gin and smoke. His mother was sprawled on the couch, an empty bottle tipped over on the coffee table, TV muttering infomercials to no one. She stirred as his shadow crossed her.

""Mom,"" he said, voice rough from disuse. ""I need your help.""

She squinted up at him, eyes red-rimmed. ""What now?""

""My friends… they’re making me go back to that abandoned house tonight. It’s dangerous. Really dangerous. Please. Call them. Tell them to leave me alone.""

A slow, bitter smile spread across her face. She pushed herself halfway upright, glass in hand though it was empty.

""Dangerous?"" Her laugh was sharp, wet, vicious. ""A house? You’re nineteen and scared of a goddamn house?""

""It’s not—""

""Don’t."" She cut him off, voice rising. ""You’re just like him. Weak. Always looking for someone to save you. Your father ran the second things got hard, and here you are, whining about a dare."" She leaned forward, eyes narrowing to slits. ""You think I’m gonna call those boys and beg? Embarrass myself for you? Lose the only friends you’ve got and you’ll be stuck here forever, leeching off me. I won’t have it. Grow up, Ethan. Go, or get out and don’t come back.""

The words landed like slaps, each one precise and practiced. He stood there a moment, chest tight, waiting for something—anything—soft to follow. Nothing came.

He turned without a word and climbed the stairs.

Back in his room, he closed the door quietly.

He sank onto the bed, stared at the wall, and waited for evening to come.

Ethan sat on the edge of his bed in the dim room, elbows on knees, hands clasped so tightly his knuckles ached. Afternoon light had faded to a dull gray smear behind the blinds. The house around him felt too quiet, as if it were listening.

He couldn’t stop picturing her.

Not the melting—that part came later. First the image of her curled in the ferns, impossibly pale, impossibly beautiful, long dark hair tangled with leaves like something painted and then abandoned in the wrong world. Fever-hot skin, seams along her arms, joints bending wrong. And those eyes when they opened: ruby, glowing faintly, squinting at him with something that looked almost like confusion.

Her voice had been soft. “I think I actually believe you.”  

“In a sane world, I would thank you.”

The words circled in his head, gentle, almost kind.

For one treacherous second he let himself wonder: What if she was like an anglerfish? The house the deep-sea body, vast and hidden, and her the luminous lure dangled in the clearing to draw things close. If that was true, then maybe she hadn’t wanted to be the bait. Maybe she was trapped in the role, appearing helpless because that was the only way the house could feed. Maybe when he carried her inside he had accidentally set her free for the day—or ruined the hunt—and her sadness had been real regret that he’d walked into it.

A tiny flicker stirred in his chest, something dangerously close to hope. Maybe she hadn’t wanted him harmed. Maybe she had tried to warn him in the only way she could.

He crushed it instantly.

The house had been a living mouth. He remembered the floorboards yielding under the pink flow, warm and soft like flesh. The walls pressing against his back, pulsing faintly, exhaling that thick sweetness. A throat. A stomach. Something vast and patient and hungry.

He remembered the old woman’s cracked voice: “Those woods took my dog… we never found my little Rocko even though we got him chipped.”

A chipped dog. Vanished without trace. Swallowed whole, maybe, dissolved into the same pink syrup, absorbed into the walls.

If the house was alive—if it needed to feed—then everything that came out of her mouth was just part of the lure. Sadness, gratitude, belief: all hot air shaped to sound human, to keep prey calm long enough to step inside. Predators didn’t need malice; they only needed results. Animals didn’t lie out of cruelty; they lied to eat.

People did the same.

The flicker of hope died cold and complete.

She had let him go yesterday only because the hunt wasn’t finished. Or because the house preferred its meals willing.

Tonight it would be.

Ethan exhaled slowly, the room colder around him.

Ethan stood at the window, watching the street through the slats of the blinds. The clock on his phone read 10:57 PM. They would be here soon.

For a moment he let himself imagine it: grabbing the keys to his beat-up Civic, throwing a few clothes in a bag, driving until the tank coughed empty or the engine seized. Just gone. No note, no goodbye. Vanishing into the night like his father had done thirteen years ago.

The thought was almost peaceful—no house, no monster, no mocking texts, no mother’s venom. Just the road and whatever came after.

But the image soured instantly. He saw himself months later: sleeping in the car, then under bridges, beard growing, eyes dull, scanning shelters for a face he hated but still recognized. Edward and Jack laughing about it years from now: “Remember Ethan? Total coward. Just ran off like his old man.” His mother drunk-telling anyone who would listen that she always knew he’d abandon her too.

Proof. Final, undeniable proof that they were all right about him.

He shook his head once, sharp.

No.

If the house took him tonight—if the throat opened and swallowed him whole—at least it would finish what everything else had started. His parents had hollowed him out years ago. The cops had looked away. His “friends” had carved off pieces whenever they needed to feel bigger. The monster would just be the last bite.

What did he really have to go back to anyway?

The first time he had run from that place, it had been pure animal panic—legs burning, lungs screaming, survival overriding everything. But now? Running again would mean surrendering the only thing they hadn’t taken yet: the right to decide how this ended.

He turned from the window and knelt beside the bed. His fingers found the familiar shape under the dust ruffle—the old Rawlings glove, leather cracked but still soft from the countless times he had oiled it as a kid. Pointless ritual. A boy’s quiet belief that if he kept it ready, his father might come back one day to play catch again.

He pulled it out slowly, held it in both hands. The pocket still carried the faint smell of saddle soap and summer grass that wasn’t real anymore.

He laid it carefully in the exact center of the unmade bed, palm smoothing the leather one last time. A silent goodbye to the child who had believed in fathers, in mothers, in friends, in a world where people stayed and help arrived.

He stood. Flicked off the lamp. The room sank into darkness, the glove left alone on the sheets like an offering.

He walked downstairs without a sound. Passed the living room where his mother lay passed out under the flickering TV, bottle clutched to her chest. He didn’t look. Didn’t pause.

Outside, the cold night air bit his face. Rain left the street slick and shining under the streetlights.

He stood just beyond the front door, hands in his pockets, eyes fixed on the empty road.

Headlights would appear soon.

No matter what waited in that house—throat yawning, eyes watching, sweetness thickening—he was not running away this time.

As someone who works from home, just likes to go to coffee shops around the metro late at night, lives solo, no family/kids, this car just does the job so beautifully. 

What I especially like about this Corolla is it’s the fleet variant. I found out that this a rare Pokémon even compared to the gr-s. 

It’s rare to even find an available corolla at any variant nowadays. 

Fleets just have a certain aesthetic na sobrang lakas lang talaga ng appeal saken, yung tipong sobrang impersonal, it could have been mistaken for an airport car or a hotel car or an island resort car. 

I just like that kind of aesthetic. 

Even if I can afford an LC (far from it! lol) I still would like it to look like like a fleet car, or the UN-type of no frill / no nonsense look. 

I guess nagkamali lang ako sa tint. They suggested the medium tint but it’s still too dark for me. MAs okay pala no tint para mag Mukhang fleet talaga. 

If you’re a first time car buyer, I highly suggest the Corolla - specifically this 12th or the upcoming (daw) 13th gen.

I felt I might share those in case they benefit anyone else :)   


* **A bad relationship started it off:** I had a short dating experience in summer 2024 that was physically abusive and manipulative. It really forced me to re-examine my strong desire for a partner, and recognize that I could be happy on my own, and often had been happy on my own, I just didn't see it through yearning for a partner. 
   * **I NEVER wanted to feel again that I could be so emotionally and physically powerless**, and that realization broke the spell that the desire to be in love and in a romantic relationship had held over me since I was a teenager. 
   * Most of my past relationships have ended either with me heartbroken from unrequited love, the other person heartbroken when I couldn't return feelings, or the relationship was abusive, like the one above.
   * The right relationship is rare, ***but it isn't rare to be really happy single, and that happiness could start right NOW.***



* **Investing in friends and family is key:** Being happy single doesn't mean you have to be a hermit, quite the contrary. Being naturally outgoing, I've invested my time in the people I have already, my friends and family. Being a godfather, a role model to children, traveling with others, or simply getting together with folks for coffee, is healing, and is something I've done ever since. 



* **Sex is only good if emotions are there:** for me, at least. Otherwise, I don't strongly desire sex and romance in my day to day life. A true spark and romantic love that lasts and is mutual is rare for me, so rather than be sad about it, I accept that. 



* **Deciding to be single takes pressure off:** as a man, deciding to be single and approach the world truly as I would wish to takes the pressure off me to:
   * Make an immense, often unrealistic amount of income to support a wife, and theoretically a family, in the high cost of living, uncertain world we have today. 
   * It allows me to really enjoy my life instead of feeling like I have to be on society's timeline of when to reach certain milestones (wife, kids, big house, lavish vacations, etc) and instead allows me to focus on what actually brings me joy.
   * What brings me joy are: solo road trips, outdoor adventures, mentorship, my career, and my hobbies.



* **The number of unhappy single men and women I meet makes me sad:** The internet doesn't help. When you have folks like Andrew Tate saying ""it's all women's fault!"" or the classic ""men are trash"" influencer girls on Instagram/Facebook/TikTok, it's really disheartening. 
   * The goal should not be to demonize the opposite sex, but instead, take radical ownership and responsibility for your own happiness. If a great relationship with the person perfect for you shows up, AWESOME. But if not, your focus should be in my opinion making your one and only time on this Earth as great as possible, and the power to do that is in your hands.

Ideally, somewhere cozy, and chill enough that I wouldn’t be holding up a line of people at 11-12pm. 

We are in MJ just over the county line, but I don’t mind a little drive as long as it does not involve paying $40 to park and then also walking 6 blocks 😅 

I like almost all food, and I’m also open to coffee shops if they have good lunch-ish food and a comfy chair. 

I was thinking about Pinewood Social, but I don’t know how busy they are on a random weekday. I’ve seen recs for hanging out at a hotel with a restaurant but most seem to only be open for dinner. I looked at Stationary at Union Station, so if anyone knows how salty they would be if I hung out for 90 mins or less, let me know!

Hello all, I’m just now joining this group and wanting to see if any of you have ever had to care for a GCC or really any other birb that has had a wing amputation?  We are unfortunately carrying for our now 1 wing GCC.

Back story, few nights ago our little girl was on my wife’s shoulder. Wife was getting something out of the fridge and our little girl decided the fridge was a good place to get human food from. Seconds later we hear a startling cry from her and my wife informed me she jumped in the fridge and the door hit her. There was a mark on her wing and she was favoring it but at the time it didn’t seem to be an issue that we knew at the time. We gave her some dinner and put her away  in her sleep cage for the night and she seemed good. Chirping away like she would every night and munching on her favorite before bed seeds.

Next morning I get her up and do her morning routine. she’s toilet trained in the morning and we get her fresh chopped food for breakfast ready and put in her day cage and while I sip coffee her and I get scitches. About an hour later she decides she’s had enough and wanted to go to her cage so like normal she flys to the cage, except today she just lands face first into my lap from the couch. That’s when I know something was wrong and she was not tucking the right wing in like normal, it was puffed up and sticking out. After calling around and finding a 24/7 vet hospital that actually had an exotic and bird veterinarian on staff and in the office on a Saturday, wife and I took her straight there and we have her sedated and an xray taken of her wings chest and back to see what the issue is/was.

She unfortunately broke both bones in, what the vet described to us as, her forearm. (ulna and radius). She gave us options to A) pin the bones, but there could be a risk of further injury or the pins not holding and she’d be back in a few days with essentially the same issue and she’d have arthritis for the remainder of her life B) amputation which would take away arthritis and her flight but she’d still live and the C) euthanasia.  We out right refused euthanasia off the bat. The vet said she’d still live a successful life with the one wing we’d just have to give her time to learn to balance and help her get to her cage and provide alternative ways for her to move around the home. So we took B) and had her wing removed at essentially the elbow.

We are 2.5 days into her amputation and she’s actually doing great. Minus the cone of shame they put on her to keep her from chewing the stitches, she’s eating, drinking, chirping and wants scritches and cuddle time. Which brings me here.. just curious if anyone her had tips tricks or any information on the care of a one winged bird. We are planning on adding platforms that she can stand on and fall onto should she loose balance. She wants much into flight and her previous owner always carried her everywhere or she’d walk on the floor so I don’t think she’s gonna have much issues get places. We just want it to be safe.

Appreciate your thoughts and time reading this.

TL;DR

Green-cheek conure injured her wing when a fridge door hit her. At first she seemed fine, but the next day couldn’t fly and held her wing oddly. Emergency X-rays showed both forearm bones were broken. We were given three options: pin the bones, amputate the wing, or euthanasia. refused euthanasia and chose amputation to avoid chronic pain and arthritis. The wing was removed at the elbow.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Took a 400-mile highway trip today in 18°F temps. Best efficiency I could manage was 1.4–1.6 mi/kWh — never got close to 2. I tried everything: heat off, seats off, minimal screen, cruise set to 65 for a solid 10 miles… no luck. The cold absolutely wrecked my plans.

Ended up stopping twice to DC fast charge for \~20 minutes at \~200 kW each. Honestly not a big deal — I’m always happy to grab a coffee and stretch.

Two major complaints though:

	1.	The drowsy driver feature is terrible. Every bump or tiny steering correction triggers it, and it cuts whatever you’re listening to. It’s more distracting (and dangerous) than helpful. I’ll be turning it off or turning it way down as soon as I find the setting.

	2.	Had a DC charger get stuck (red ring). Quick call to OnStar, followed by an embarrassing search behind the wheel to find the tiny emergency release loop — all while pulling on the charger and being watched by everyone else charging. 10/10 public humiliation experience 😰

Overall still enjoying the truck, but cold-weather efficiency and these two issues were rough today.",3,1765853389.0,GMCSierraEV,1,1.0,False

My partner travels at least once a year to visit parents on another continent and usually it's 3 weeks and was several months when parent was ill. I gained 10 lbs last time partner was away for 2 months.

I travel there sometimes (once in several years) but I don't have as much vacation days and also visiting partner's parents is not vacation for me. Plus our pet requires intricate and expensive pet sitting and has not been well lately.

I used to get very scared alone at night (Cptsd from trauma made me hypervigilant). Over the years I was able to get used to nights and can sleep with a small lamp but my ears are always perked for noises.

Self care is most challenging when I'm alone. I overeat, eat sweets, watch too much TV, go to sleep late, talk to myself, chew my nails, pick my skin, don't shower as much, etc. I don't have many friends close by so I might meet a friend once in this time. Sometimes I even fantasize about having a lover, lol,  because I miss the closenes of another human at home.

I tend to be careless with dishes and cleanliness and let things accumulate until it's bad.

When I was younger, I would redecorate, or paint a room or get a new hobby or something creative. Now I can barely make sure I eat proper food. I never make myself coffee or tea even though I typically have it daily (partner likes doing that).

Basically I feel like a morose old person. I'm terrified of one day being alone permanently or widowed. I do have the pet and care for it well.

About me. I'm a father of 2 and do not want anymore as I can't unless I decide to (vasectomy). If that turns you off then good, because I am honest and don't want to lead on any unreal expectations. 

I am divorced after 15 plus years of a young marriage. I truly believed in focusing my life on my partner and family and career to be the best for them. Wanting that since I was so young. But it didn't work out amicably. So no drama or anything like that. And we don't live together. 

I still believe in a lifelong partner. Gone through many years working on myself. In 5 years only one other relationship that also ended well. 

Currently looking for someone who is very affectionate and emotional as I am. Love language is important to me as it is what lead to my divorce. We all need attention. Not just the things we see in mainstream (since I can't say the real things), but also touch and affection, cuddling which is so great. My love language. 

I work in Healthcare. So I can be sarcastic with a dark humor but love so much. Most people see me and think I'm too serious or not approachable... but for some reason, older women seem to ask for my help to get something from the high shelf. Lol. And I'm respectful and do help. 

I'm complicated in ways. Trauma from childhood and lack of confidence in areas due to those traumas. Not scared of therapy and have done it with an awesome therapist. 

Too much?

If so then good. I hate playing games and do not do dates. One person focus at a time. I am very straight forward and don't want to waste time. Needs, wants, desires, future... let's get to the point. 

I'm about 5'11"" and 210lbs with a more muscular but dad bod build. Dark brown eyes and thin curly hair. Caramel skin tone I think but maybe lighter or just a light Caramel lol. OK to share a picture but since I work in healthcare, it will take some trust.

Would love to find someone near me. North Georgia. I've done long distance. It's hard. However honestly, if we connect then maybe it can work. Just know, I can't leave GA until my kids are fully grown. 9 more years at least. 

That's me in a nut shell. Real, honest, to the point, but I'm really loving. Top much. 

Not like a headliner, but I love cooking for others. Not clean as much but cooking... hell yeah. Love seeing the faces of people who appreciate the time and love I gave into it.

I feel like dropout wants to stick to panel show format. Which the fact they have successful panel shows based in America is impressive. But I realized that in gastronaunts feels off because the comedians are just describing the kitchen. It’s not a contest of who is funniest though it wants to be. This could be solved in a few ways. The comedians are the chefs, the comedians are swapped out per episode so they have to host the show with no context— the show being a cooking competition, 

I think some examples of comedians doing good that feels aplicable to dropout vibe are phoning it in and without a recipe (try guys), culinary crimes and eat it or yeet it(smosh). I also think it would be cool to do more of a comedians getting coffee. So it’s Jordan going to a cool restaurant and having a conversation.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

We are unfortunately carrying for our now 1 wing GCC. 

Back story, few nights ago our little girl was on my wife’s shoulder. Wife was getting something out of the fridge and our little girl decided the fridge was a good place to get human food from. Seconds later we hear a startling cry from her and my wife informed me she jumped in the fridge and the door hit her. There was a mark on her wing and she was favoring it but at the time it didn’t seem to be an issue that we knew at the time. We gave her some dinner and put her away  in her sleep cage for the night and she seemed good. Chirping away like she would every night and munching on her favorite before bed seeds. 

Next morning I get her up and do her morning routine. she’s toilet trained in the morning and we get her fresh chopped food for breakfast ready and put in her day cage and while I sip coffee her and I get scitches. About an hour later she decides she’s had enough and wanted to go to her cage so like normal she flys to the cage, except today she just lands face first into my lap from the couch. That’s when I know something was wrong and she was not tucking the right wing in like normal, it was puffed up and sticking out. After calling around and finding a 24/7 vet hospital that actually had an exotic and bird veterinarian on staff and in the office on a Saturday, wife and I took her straight there and we have her sedated and an xray taken of her wings chest and back to see what the issue is/was. 

She unfortunately broke both bones in, what the vet described to us as, her forearm. (ulna and radius). She gave us options to A) pin the bones, but there could be a risk of further injury or the pins not holding and she’d be back in a few days with essentially the same issue and she’d have arthritis for the remainder of her life B) amputation which would take away arthritis and her flight but she’d still live and the C) euthanasia.  We out right refused euthanasia off the bat. The vet said she’d still live a successful life with the one wing we’d just have to give her time to learn to balance and help her get to her cage and provide alternative ways for her to move around the home. So we took B) and had her wing removed at essentially the elbow. 

We are 2.5 days into her amputation and she’s actually doing great. Minus the cone of shame they put on her to keep her from chewing the stitches, she’s eating, drinking, chirping and wants scritches and cuddle time. Which brings me here.. just curious if anyone her had tips tricks or any information on the care of a one winged bird. We are planning on adding platforms that she can stand on and fall onto should she loose balance. She wants much into flight and her previous owner always carried her everywhere or she’d walk on the floor so I don’t think she’s gonna have much issues get places. We just want it to be safe. 

Appreciate your thoughts and time reading this. 

TL;DR

Green-cheek conure injured her wing when a fridge door hit her. At first she seemed fine, but the next day couldn’t fly and held her wing oddly. Emergency X-rays showed both forearm bones were broken. We were given three options: pin the bones, amputate the wing, or euthanasia. refused euthanasia and chose amputation to avoid chronic pain and arthritis. The wing was removed at the elbow.",2,1765853002.0,greencheeks,6,1.0,False

Hey, I'm back. I went to see Levi again this Saturday. No matter how many deliveries I made this week, no matter how many terrifying things I witnessed or impossible challenges I faced, Saturday afternoon from two to six belonged to him. It's our unwritten rule.



The company provides room and board, and I provide the social interaction, and the closest thing to parental care you can get when your ward is a shapeshifter who sometimes forgets what species he's supposed to be.



Today's destination is Riverside Park. Levi had been talking about going there all week, to see real squirrels, not the mutated squirrels that live on the fringes of society, or the kind of telepathic squirrels I once delivered handmade nuts to at the Pemberton Building.



""Normal squirrels,"" he said, his eyes sparkling with excitement, ""the kind that just run around eating acorns and don't try to sell you prophecies.""



""That was only once,"" I retorted. ""And I didn't buy the prophecy.""



""You gave him a twenty-dollar bill.""



""He was persistent.""



Now we're sitting on a park bench, Biscuit lying at our feet, looking like a perfectly normal uncle and nephew enjoying a spring afternoon. They can't see the faint glow around Levi, or how his shadow occasionally moves independently, or how he tracks the squirrels with predatory precision.



""I'm doing really well, right?"" Levi said, his eyes fixed on a particularly plump squirrel. ""I haven't even thought about chasing them.""



""You're doing great.""



""I haven't even thought about what they taste like.""



""Levi.""



""What? I didn't think so! I'm just acknowledging that I didn't think so. That's progress."" He finally looked at me, grinning. ""Can we get ice cream? You promised.""



I did promise him ice cream. It's a routine we've established over the past six months: going to the park, watching squirrels, eating ice cream, then going home for pizza and watching a movie of Levi's choosing. “There’s an ice cream truck over there,” I said, pointing to a white van decorated with colorful patterns and playing cheerful music. “Want to go?”



“Can I go by myself? Like a big kid?” Levi jumped up, bouncing excitedly. “I promise I won’t transform. I won’t even talk to any strange people. I’ll just buy the ice cream, pay, say thank you, and come right back.”



I hesitated. The park was safe, at least as safe as anywhere in this city, despite the hidden layers of the city that most people couldn't see. And Levi needed independence. He needed to be trusted.



“Okay. But you have to stay where I can see you. If anything feels wrong—”



“Run first, ask questions later, I know.” He was already walking towards the ice cream truck, his gait now almost entirely human, only a slight bounce betraying his non-human nature.



I watched him go, Biscuit's head resting on my knee. The little booklet was still in my jacket pocket, never far from me. I'd carried it every day for two and a half years, until the leather cover was worn into the shape of my chest. Some pages I had memorized. Some pages revealed new content every time I looked at them, entries seemingly appearing as needed, rules manifesting just when I was about to need them.



The afternoon sun was warm and pleasant. A family was playing on the grass. A couple was throwing a frisbee. An old man was feeding pigeons. Everything was normal. Peaceful. Days like this sometimes made me forget that I had been working in this abnormal place for two and a half years.



Then, the booklet started to burn.



Not metaphorically, but literally burning. I snatched it out of my pocket and threw it onto the bench, smoke rising from the pages. Biscuit jumped up, growling warily. The booklet was open to a page that hadn't existed thirty seconds ago. The paper was crisp, the ink still wet, and there was only one word, written in a hurried, scrawling hand:



RUN!



I snapped my head up. Levi was by the ice cream truck, pointing at the different flavors, a smile on his face. Everything looked perfectly normal. Except...



Except now another ice cream truck appeared. It drove in from the other side of the park, a road that definitely hadn't been there before. A white van, brightly decorated, playing the same cheerful music from its speakers. In fact, the music from both trucks was perfectly synchronized.



Just as I watched, a third ice cream truck materialized out of thin air at the north entrance of the park.



""Oh no.""



I grabbed the smoking pamphlet—I watched as new words appeared on it: Three ice cream trucks mean hunting mode. They will surround you. Do not let them trap you. Do not accept ice cream under any circumstances.



I ran.



Biscuit ran ahead of me, already sprinting towards Levi, barking anxiously. I dashed across the park, leaping over a picnic blanket, nearly colliding with the couple playing frisbee, everyone staring at me.



""Levi!"" I shouted. ""Levi, run!""



He turned around, an ice cream cone in his hand. Chocolate chip flavor, a confused expression on his face. Then he saw my expression, saw Biscuit's frantic barking, and his survival instincts kicked in. The ice cream dropped from his hand, and he sprinted towards me.



The trucks moved.



Not driving. Sliding. They defied the laws of physics, the rules of the road, and the basic principles of how vehicles should move. They slid across the grass, hopped over curbs, moving with a predatory coordination. Their music grew louder, more jarring, weaving together into a melody that made my teeth ache.



""What's going on?!"" Levi shouted as we met in the middle of the park.



""No time! Run!""



We ran. The trucks pursued us. The people in the park were now also noticing the trucks, not because anything was wrong, but because the ice cream trucks were offering specials, deals, and free samples. I saw families standing up, children pulling at their parents' hands, all drawn like moths to a flame by the cheerful vehicles. “Don’t listen to them!” I shouted, but my voice was drowned out by the music.



A truck blocked our path from the east. Another approached from the south. A third was driving us towards the center of the park, towards a gazebo I’d never noticed before, a gazebo that certainly hadn’t been there when we arrived.



“Eric!” Levi’s voice was panicked. “I can’t hold on! I’m going to transform!”



“Then transform! Whatever it takes to keep you alive!”



His human body suddenly swelled. His legs lengthened, his knees bending backward, becoming digitigrade, suitable for running. Claws grew on his hands. His face protruded forward, becoming something between a man and a wolf, with sharp, numerous teeth. And from his back, something I’d never seen before, eight thick, muscular appendages sprouted, black and glistening.



Tentacles. Octopus tentacles, each as thick as my arm, covered in suction cups that opened and closed like hungry mouths. “I didn’t know I could do this!” Levi shouted, his voice distorted by the changes in his throat. “I didn’t know I had this power inside!”



The first ice cream truck lunged at us, not driving now, but pouncing, its wheels off the ground, attacking like a wild beast. Levi’s tentacles shot out, wrapping around the truck’s front bumper. Metal twisted and deformed. The truck’s cheerful surface cracked open, and I saw what was inside. Teeth. So many teeth. Spiraling like a lamprey’s mouth.



Levi threw the truck away. It flew thirty feet, crashed into a tree, and exploded into pink and white smoke that smelled like cotton candy and formaldehyde.



“Awesome!” Levi screamed, adrenaline and fear making him manic. “I’m so powerful!”



“Two more!” I shouted. “Stay focused!”



The second truck was smarter. It split open in the middle, unfolding like a flower, revealing an interior filled with eyes and the same spiraling teeth. A long, grasping tongue, dripping with some kind of liquid, hissed as it extended towards us across the grass.



Levi's tentacles intercepted it, wrapping around the tongue, and a tug-of-war ensued. The truck shrieked, a sound like a mixture of grinding gears and human vocal cords.



""Eric! The pamphlet，What do we do?!""



I fumbled for the pamphlet, flipping through the pages that were being rewritten in real-time. I found the relevant entry: Ice Cream Trucks (Hostile). They hunt in packs. They feed on wonder and innocence, especially the moment a child realizes that magic is real and dangerous. If three trucks surround a target simultaneously, the target is devoured and becomes part of the convoy. Known weaknesses: salt circles, iron filings, or simultaneously destroying all three trucks.



""We need to destroy all three trucks at once!"" I shouted.



""How?!""



Good question. The third truck was now circling us, looking for an opportunity. Two of Levi's tentacles were wrapped around the second truck, and four more were writhing defensively in the air, his werewolf-hybrid body balanced on his reversed legs. He looked like something out of a nightmare.



Think, Eric. Think like a delivery man. Think like someone who survived two and a half years of impossible delivery missions. What do I have? What resources do I have?



My phone. My company phone.



I pulled out my phone and dialed the company number.



""Eric,"" the operator's voice was calm, even slightly amused. ""Let me guess. Ice cream emergency?""



""Three trucks! They're hunting! Levi's mutated, he's grown tentacles, it's horrible, and—""



""Tentacles are a sign of evolution. That's good for him. Are the tentacles pink or black?""



""Black! What does that matter?!""



""Black means he's tapping into his deeper biological abilities. If they were pink, it would mean he was hallucinating. This is good."" I heard the rustling of paper. “Those trucks. Are they in formation yet?”



“Almost,About thirty seconds!”



“Do you have anything made of iron on you? If not, there’s an iron plate embedded in the cover of the pamphlet. When the trucks are in formation, throw it at the middle truck. The iron will disrupt their formation. Then Levi can take them out one by one.”



“The pamphlet?! I need that pamphlet!”



“Eric. Trust me. Throw the pamphlet. It will come back. It always comes back.”



The third truck was moving into position, forming a triangle with Levi and me at the center. The gazebo I’d noticed earlier was now behind us, and I realized it wasn’t a gazebo, it was a throat. The whole thing was a giant mouth, the teeth disguised as decorative trim, waiting to swallow us when the trucks pushed us back.



“Levi， Hold on for five more seconds!”



His tentacles were now wrapped around two of the trucks, gripping them with sheer force. His wolf-like face was contorted with effort, saliva dripping from his fangs.



The trucks were in formation. A perfect triangle. A clanging sound synchronized into a single note, not a sound, but a pressure, reality warping around us, the air thick with the smell of carnival popcorn and blood.



I threw the pamphlet.



It spun through the air, pages fluttering, and struck the center of the gazebo-like mouth. A blue flash, a smell of ozone, and they shattered into pieces, evaporating before they hit the ground.



The formation was broken. The trucks screamed in unison.



“Now, Levi!” He didn’t need to be told twice. Six tentacles grabbed the first truck, lifting it off the ground, then slamming it into the second. The impact was tremendous. Both vehicles twisted and deformed, the ice cream truck shells peeling away to reveal writhing flesh and metal wreckage beneath.



The third truck tried to escape, but Levi’s remaining two tentacles shot out, impossibly long, and wrapped around its axles. He yanked it back, pulling it into the pile of wreckage from the other two trucks.



Then he squeezed.



All eight tentacles contracted simultaneously. The metal shrieked. Flesh and blood burst. The three trucks were compressed into a twisted ball of matter, getting smaller and smaller until—



Bang.



They vanished. Completely gone. Leaving only scorched marks on the grass and the lingering smell of burnt sugar.



Levi collapsed to the ground, his body rippling, his tentacles retracting into his back, his legs transforming back into human form, and his face returning to that of an eleven-year-old boy. He lay on the grass, panting and covered in sweat.



I ran to his side. ""Are you okay? Are you hurt?""



""That was..."" he gasped, ""...the coolest thing... I've everdone that.""



I couldn't help but laugh. Hysterical, relieved laughter that made my ribs ache. Biscuit licked both our faces, his tail wagging furiously, celebrating our survival.



The pamphlet appeared in my hand. It simply materialized out of thin air, warm and intact, as if it had never left.



The people in the park started moving again, as if someone had pressed the play button on a paused video. But none of them seemed to remember the trucks or the fight. They simply went back to their picnics and frisbee games, reality automatically correcting itself to maintain normalcy.



""Can we still get ice cream?"" Levi asked weakly.



""Of course,"" I said. ""Of course, we can get ice cream."" We walked to a grape-flavored ice cream shop, Levi holding my hand with one hand and stroking Biscuit with the other. He was completely back in human form, but I noticed that his shadow had several extra tentacles, while his body didn't. The tentacles were still there, just invisible, lurking beneath the surface.



The shop owner served us himself, an elderly Italian man who glanced at us and said, ""Ah. Another ice cream truck? They show up every few years. Always causing trouble."" He scooped us two generous portions. “It’s free. You did a great job chasing them away. The children will thank you, even if they don’t know it themselves.”



“How do you know?” I asked.



He tapped his temple with his finger. “I can see things. I’ve been able to see things for many years. That’s why my ice cream is safe. I know what the other ice cream trucks are. I make sure my ice cream is just ice cream.” He smiled.



We sat outside, eating ice cream in the afternoon sun. Levi ordered chocolate chip again. I got vanilla, because I’m boring like that. Biscuit also got a small cup of dog-friendly vanilla ice cream, because Giuseppe had specially prepared some for good dogs who save the world.



“Eric?” Levi said, his mouth full of ice cream.



“Hmm?”



“Thank you for not being scared. About those tentacles. Some people would definitely be scared.”



“Levi, I once delivered food to a thirteenth floor that didn't even exist. I rode a horse to a castle with a well in it, and the well contained something ancient. I watched you eat pizza for the first time, and you even forgot to use your hands.” I took a bite of my ice cream. “So, in my opinion, tentacles are cool.”



He grinned. “Really?”



“Really. But maybe practice a few more times. Before you use them again. So you don't accidentally grab a real ice cream truck.”



“That would be bad.”



“That would be very bad.” We finished our ice cream, walked home in the sunset, and then ordered pizza. That night, Levi fell asleep on the couch halfway through a movie, and when Marcus came to pick him up, I carried him back to the car he was getting heavier and heavier; one of my colleagues explained that shapeshifters gain weight rapidly as they mature. In another year or two, I wouldn't be able to carry him anymore.



—



Bipolar disorder is a liar. My therapist, or maybe just myself, always says that. It deceives you when you're manic, telling you that you don't need sleep, you don't need medication, you don't need help, because you've finally seen everything clearly, finally unlocked your true potential. It also deceives you when you're depressed, telling you that everything is meaningless, nothing will ever get better, and the weight on your chest will never disappear.



Tonight, it was deceiving me in the first way. The clarity brought on by mania, but it wasn't true clarity, but rather an electric tingling sensation coursing through my veins, making me unable to sit still, making my thoughts race faster than I could process them, making me feel like the walls of the apartment were closing in on me.



I had already taken my medication. But it hadn't kicked in yet. Maybe another hour, or two. So I paced back and forth. I brewed coffee, but I didn't drink any of it.

The company phone rang.



I should ignore it, I should let it go to voicemail, or in this dimension of normal time and space... Any company that delivers physical goods would have a voicemail-like function. But the manic part of my brain saw an opportunity: movement, activity, a goal. Delivering could burn off this energy. Delivering could focus my attention on something else, instead of those chaotic thoughts.



I grabbed the phone.



Delivery address: 447 Ashwood Street, Apartment 12. Simple. Straightforward. The address was in an ordinary neighborhood, the kind of place I'd delivered to a hundred times.



The entry in the booklet was longer than usual, but I was so giddy with excitement that I barely read it carefully:



447 Ashwood Street is a special building. Reality is fragile there. Apartment 12 has three doors, sometimes a fourth appears out of nowhere, each marked with a cross. Only one is real. The others lead elsewhere. Choose correctly.



I should have read it more carefully. I should have looked at the extra warnings, the supplementary notes, and the previous delivery driver's comments. But I was in a manic state, acting impulsively, my brain a jumble of caffeine and neurochemicals, the words blurring before my eyes.



I drove to the address. The building was old, a Victorian-era structure converted into apartments, paint peeling, the porch crumbling. The kind of place where the rent is cheap because the landlord can't be bothered to maintain it properly. Normal. Ordinary. Safe. 



The delivery was chicken curry and garlic naan. It smelled delicious, and my stomach reminded me that I hadn't eaten dinner yet. When I have these episodes, I often forget to eat until I'm shaking from hunger.



I climbed to the second floor. The corridor was narrow, the wallpaper peeling in strips, and only a flickering light bulb provided barely adequate illumination. Apartment doors lined both sides of the corridor: 8, 9, 10, 11…



Then, there were three doors, all marked ""Number 12."" They were identical. The same peeling brown paint, the same brass door numbers, the same cheap locks. Each door had a cross painted on it, possibly with white paint, or something else. However, these crosses were slightly different, varying in style and proportion. One looked like a Catholic cross, symmetrical and regular. One looked like an Orthodox cross, with a slanted bar at the bottom. And another was older and cruder, like the kind of cross carved into a tree to ward off evil spirits.



The pamphlet said that only one door was real. The others led elsewhere.



I stared at the three doors, and in my manic state, I was convinced I could deduce the answer through logical reasoning. The Catholic cross was too obvious, so it was probably wrong. The Orthodox cross was the most complex, so maybe that was the right one? Or was this reverse psychology, and the simplest, crudest cross was the correct one because… Which one is the real one?



My thoughts raced, a chaotic mess, each conclusion contradicting the last. I couldn't focus. The medication hadn't kicked in yet, and my brain felt like it was short-circuiting.



I needed help.



I should call Marcus.



No, wait. This was just a simple delivery. Calling for backup... that would make me look weak. I've been doing this for two and a half years. I can handle three doors.



But which door to choose?



I stood there, paralyzed by indecision, pretending to be deep in thought, the takeout bag in my hand growing heavier and heavier.



Then I made a mistake.



I knocked on the middle door. The one with the Orthodox cross. Because it felt right in that moment, because my frantic brain was convinced it had solved the puzzle with pure intuitive genius.



The door opened.



Not inward, like a normal door. But outward, and fast, slamming into me and knocking me back a few steps. I stumbled, leaning against the opposite wall, and looked up.



The thing standing in the doorway wasn't human. It had a human shape, a woman in a tattered Victorian dress, hair hanging over her face—but the proportions were wrong. Too tall. Arms too long. Too many joints in her fingers.



""You're not my dinner,"" she said, her voice like wind whistling through a broken windowpane. ""You're the delivery boy. You chose wrong.""



""I—"" I took a few steps back. ""I'm sorry. Wrong apartment. I'll just—""



""It's too late for that now."" She stepped into the hallway, and where her feet touched the floor, the wood instantly rotted. ""You knocked on the door. You opened the door. You attracted our attention. There will be consequences.""



The other two doors opened.



From the left door emerged a man who looked like a priest, but his cross was upside down, and his eyes were empty sockets, oozing black oil.



From the right door emerged a child, about six years old, but children don't smile like that. And children don't have teeth that sharp.



""Three doors,"" the woman said. ""The three of us."" We waited so long, and finally someone knocked on the door. We were so hungry.”



This was bad. This was really bad. The earlier manic confidence vanished without a trace, replaced by the cold, clear-headedness of genuine fear.



I pulled out my phone and dialed Marcus's private number.  Since the operator was probably off duty, he answered after only one ring.



“Eric. It’s two in the morning. You’d better have a good explanation—”



“I chose wrong,” I said, backing away down the corridor as the three things advanced towards me. “The door. I chose the wrong door. I need help.”



A moment of silence. Then: “You didn’t finish reading the text, did you?”



“I, uh, no. I was too impulsive. I thought I could—”



“Where exactly are you?”



“Second floor. The corridor. There are three things coming towards me. They look very hungry.”



“Stall them. Don’t let them touch you. Don’t accept anything they offer. I’ll be there in five minutes. If you die before then, I can’t help you.”



The woman tilted her head. “Is that your manager? How responsible. But he won’t make it in time. When we want to be fast, we’re very fast.”



I needed to buy time. I needed to keep them interested, but not let them become aggressive. My hand went into my pocket, finding the pamphlet, my fingers anxiously flipping through the pages, my eyes fixed on the approaching creatures.



I found the text. I read the rest of it:



If you choose wrong, the fae will appear. They are ancient, existing before the boundaries were solidified. They are always hungry. They will make deals with you, trading your voice for safe passage, your memories for protection, your name for your life. Do not accept anything. This company was founded by the God of Famine himself, to maintain the boundaries. Invoke the founder’s protection, and they must stop.



I straightened up, trying to sound more confident than I felt. “I invoke the protection of the God of Famine. This delivery is under the protection of the Ouroboros. You must let me pass.” The three creatures stopped. The woman hissed, revealing layers of teeth.



“Ouroboros,” she spat. “Always Ouroboros. Always taking the best things for itself.” But she still took a step back.



“He has the right,” the priest-like creature said reluctantly. “The contract has been signed. The boundaries have been drawn. We cannot touch those protected by the serpent god.”



The child pouted. “But we’re so hungry. We haven’t had a proper meal in decades. Can’t we just have a little bit? Just his shadow? He won’t even notice.”



“No,” the woman said, though it sounded regretful. “The rules are clear. The God of Famine keeps his promises, and we must too, even if we’re starving.” Footsteps sounded on the stairs. Marcus appeared.



“Goblins,” Marcus said calmly, his tone as if discussing the weather. “It’s been a long time since I’ve seen your kind. I didn’t expect you to be making your home in a boundary building.”



“Marcus.” The woman’s voice changed, becoming almost respectful. “After all these years, you’re still doing messenger work?”



“Someone has to. Eric, which door is the real one?”



“I… I don’t know. That’s the problem.”



Marcus sighed. “The crude cross. Always the crude cross. The older and simpler the symbol, the more powerful it is. The fancy ones are just distractions.” He walked past the three goblins, who watched him but didn’t move, and Marcus knocked on the fourth door, the one with the simple cross.



An ordinary human voice answered, “Hello? Who is it?”



“Delivery,” Marcus called out. “Chicken curry.”



The door opened, swinging inward like a normal door, revealing a perfectly ordinary room. A young woman in pajamas opened the door. “Oh, thank goodness, I’m starving. Sorry, I thought I heard someone talking? What are my neighbors up to now?”



“Nothing to worry about, ma’am.” Marcus took the takeout bag from my trembling hands and handed it to her. She paid, gave a generous tip, and closed the door.



The elves watched us with a mixture of frustration and a touch of reverence.



Marcus turned to me. ""Eric. Let's go.""



""Wait,"" the woman said. ""I have a question for this messenger. Do you know who you work for? Do you understand the true meaning of the Ouroboros?""



""I..."" I looked at Marcus, then frantically flipped through the booklet. ""The booklet says the company was founded by Famine, and it's an Ouroboros. A snake that devours its own tail.""



Marcus didn't speak until we were in the car.



""Yes,"" Marcus said. ""That's right. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Famine, is real, Eric. It's one of the fundamental forces that make up the universe, given form. It's the hunger that drives all existence. Every sixty years, it must devour itself, must consume its own essence to restart the cycle. That's the meaning of our existence. To ensure the cosmic cycle continues.""



""You work for a god?"" I whispered.



""Not a god. Something older than gods. Something more fundamental. To them, humans are like goldfish, and the fae are the cats that steal the goldfish."" Marcus started the car.



""That's terrifying,"" was all I could say.



""That's why we have rules. That's why we follow procedures. That's why we feed the creatures that live in the cracks. Someone has to do this job, Eric. Someone has to walk the line, keeping the two sides as separate as possible. But it's not entirely possible, like... in London. The real London is beneath London, and every year a few humans accidentally take the King's Cross train to the real London, instead of Soho.""



We drove back to the warehouse in silence. I sat in the passenger seat, the frantic energy finally fading, leaving only exhaustion and shame.



""I'm sorry,"" I finally said. ""I should have finished reading that record. I should have called earlier. I was so hyped up, I thought—""



""You thought you could handle it alone. I know."" “Marcus glanced at me. “Eric, I’m going to tell you something I wouldn’t tell most couriers. This job finds people like you because you already have one foot in the borderlands of two worlds, you can perceive things that others can’t. That makes you valuable. But it also makes you vulnerable.”



“So I’m a broken person?”



“You’re just different. There’s a difference.” He drove the car into the warehouse parking lot. “You’re one of the best couriers I’ve ever managed, you just need to know when to ask for help. Because I still need you.”



“I chose the wrong door,” I said softly, and Marcus didn’t reply.



“Can I ask a question? About the Famine?”



“Ask away.”



“If something like God is so powerful, so fundamental… can it be killed?”



“No,” Marcus said simply. “It can’t. God doesn’t live in the way you understand life; God simply exists. It has always existed and will always exist. All we can do is maintain our relationship with it.”



“Have you seen it? The Famine?”



Marcus gave that most standard of smiles. “Oh, yes. Many times. I’ll eventually encounter it again. Every manager does, at least once. It’s part of the final evaluation.”



“Final evaluation of what?”



“Whether you get promoted to management. Or switch to something else.” He got out of the car, telling me to return the car to him tomorrow. “But that’s for later.



“Go home. Get a good night’s sleep. Take a day off tomorrow. No deliveries. Doctor’s orders.”



“You’re not a doctor.”



“I’m seven hundred years old. Close enough.” He paused. “Eric? Have a good holiday.”



I didn’t know that ,six months later, I would meet the Famine myself.

“Ok Jacob. This isn't going to be like last time, is it?” Asks the clinician. 

Jacob tilts his head slightly and asks “How do you mean?”

:cut: :flashback:
In a chaotic scene, two security guards carry a struggling Jacob down the hallway, and out of the front door of a hospital. 

“Why?!? Why?!?” Jacob cries out as he is held from reentering the facility. 

An irate black man storms outside and yells. “You told our intake nurse your last drink was two weeks ago! That's why!”

“I have a drinking problem! I do!” Jacob yells back

“Get the fuck out of here before we call the cops!”
:cut: :end flashback:

“Really?” Asks the woman. 

Jacob leans forward, changing his body language from casual to serious. “You know why I am here, and how I got here.”

The woman turns more sympathetic. “Yes, you came directly from the hospital.”

“Because I overdosed on heroin.”

“Yes. I am glad you are still with us.”

Jacob takes a big inhale and exhales and says “Thank you, as am I.”

The clinician gives him a second and then says “So I have more questions I need to ask you.”

Jacob puts his head in his hands “I am ashamed of all of this, can't we do this later?”

“It's either this, or group.”

Jacob stands up quickly. “I'll go to group.”

The clinician exhales and says “Very well, it's down the hall, it just started.”

Jacob bows, and leaves the room and heads down the hall. 

Jacob walks in the room and finds a seat. 
Jacob sits in a circle of 12 other people, most of whom are wearing the same maroon hospital scrubs that he is wearing. They sit in a not fully cleaned, small room with a TV on the wall, about 5 circular tables pushed to the side, and a coffee machine on the table.

”My name is Jacob, and I’m an addict.”

“Hi Jacob” responds the group, in unison. 

The group facilitator then says “OK, now that we've all introduced ourselves, let's go around the circle and give a little insight into what got you each here today. Jacob, why don't you start us off?”

Jacob blankly stares at a spot on the floor directly in front of him, eyes wide. 
“Jacob?” the facilitator says again. 

Jacob takes a deep breath, looks at the facilitator, and begins. “Why am I here? Like, here in this detox? Here as in, ‘here’ at this point in my life compared to where I should be? Here as in…”

“Here, in detox, as an addict.” The facilitator clarifies. 

Jacob smirks, and restarts. “I am here because I can't stop doing heroin… ever.”

Jacob stops talking. Everyone looks at him either puzzled, amused, or both. 
“And you want to stop doing heroin, right?”

“Yes, that.” Jacob nods approvingly as he says it. 

Everyone sits in silence. 
“That's all you want to share Jacob?”

I went to the doctor in August after I had finally had it with my headaches (since childhood) and got a full check up and ekg (everything normal and within stable parameters) and doctor said BP and headaches were most likely due to anxiety and would rather not prescribe any medication. 

My BP is 140/90 on my first take and goes down to 124/83 2-3 minutes after.

1pnqny4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pnqny4,"2008, 2009, 2010 Vertical of Chateau Ste. Michelle Cabernet - Canoe Ridge Estate","Based a recommendation from one of Y’all to give Chateau Ste. Michelle a try, I purchased a 3 yr vertical of aged wine from the vineyard.

As we know, CSM is more of a value brand and typically accessible at Grocery Stores and most wine shops. Canoe Ridge is one of their nicer locations and I purchased for about $40/bottle for 15-17yr old bottles through a sale the vineyard was running in October.  All 3 wines were

completely different.

2008 - completely forgettable

Dark fruit, black cherry with a floral note on the nose, cherry and slight coffee on the palate,

tannins seemed non existent and the finish was short… i mean embarrassedly short to being zero.  I would not recommend this vintage.

2009 - probably one of the best wines I’ve had in the past 4 to 5 years.  Ridiculously good.

Fragrant black and blue fruit with toasty oak, clove/anise, just perfumed so beautifully.  Dark cherry with sweet fruits, tobacco, sandalwood with a hint of vanilla, this wine was round and creamy with well integrated tannins and a long finish… I kept smacking my lips and tongue.  Man did it go down quick… too quick.  if I could drink this wine every day for the rest of my life, I would be very happy.

2010 - A very good wine

Dark fruit like currant and cassis, cinnamon and an earthy ash note.  Great tannins, nicely integrated , with flavors of cherry, espresso , cedar, and milk chocolate.  I was a little confused drinking this wine as the flavors straddled old and new world but in the end, a very good wine.

Each wine was about 14.5% abv and 95% cab with a touch of Merlot, Malbec or Syrah or all three, leading to a unique flavor profile for each.

I pan seared and basted a filet with garlic butter and herbs, a blueberry and red wine compote and side of broccolini… all three went well but the 2009 was outstanding, the rich round fruity wine played well with the blueberry sauce, the chocolatey coffee notes on the 2010 was splendid with the steak.",9,1765852766.0,wine,2,1.0,False

My ex and I broke up a weak ago due to her need to fix some personal issues, find a steady job, get on new medication, find a new therapist and learn how to take care of herself, etc. It was an extremely happy, healthy, strong relationship that we both put our all into and talked often about our future. She said she didn't want to lose me, and we decided to meet up for a coffee five weeks after our breakup. We are no contact, just friends on social media. I don't know what it will be like, or if we will decide to meet up again another month after that. We both said the other person is the only we want to marry, have kids with, be with, but she also said she has no idea how long this will take her to heal/fix and doesn't want to give ma. timeline or get both our hopes up. 

TLDR: Going through an amicable breakup with plans to see each other again, but no plans to get back together. I dont know how to feel about it.

1pnqhwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1pnqhwe/feeling_hurt_and_lost/,Feeling hurt and lost,"About a month ago, Bramble (a member of the local kink community) expressed interest in having a scene with one or both of my partners. I was open to that. When Sunflower (one of my partners), started expressing romantic and sexual interest in Bramble, I was a little surprised but encouraged her to explore since I had been wanting her to start feeling comfortable looking for new partners. Sunflower and I had been going through a very rough patch for a while due to issues caused by a bad therapist who didn't understand polyamory. We're still working on mending things, and things have been getting much better for us. 

Dahlia (my other partner) had been becoming more distant due to feeling dragged into Sunflower and I's relationship issues. I had tried to not bring my issues with Sunflower up around her, but because she and Sunflower are best friends, she has ended up listening to Sunflower venting on occasion. I had brought up several times how I didn't like how disconnected Dahlia and I had been lately, and how upsetting I found her being glued to her phone during our date and cuddle time was. She had agreed and suggested that we try to reconnect on our next date night. She has also asked if I'd be okay since I had to go into the office the next day after our date night if Bramble came over for her and him to discuss a possible scene they wanted to try at the next play party. 

The weekend before this date night, Sunflower and Bramble had oral sex together. Sunflower had given me a heads up that he was spending the night and that it was a possibility. Date night with Dahlia came around, and the first part of our date she spent cleaning her apartment for Bramble's visit. After she got to a point she was okay stopping at, we made dinner, had a small scene, had sex, and then she passed out. When we got up the next morning, I tried to cuddle her for a bit, but after 10 minutes or so, she jumped out of bed and went back to cleaning. I got up and made coffee for us and tried to enjoy the time I had with her before I would have to leave for the office. After about another 30 minutes, Bramble messaged her saying he had got off work early and was almost there. I didn't want to be there when they were discussing their scene, so I left. It felt very sudden and very much unnerved me since the way Dahlia had communicated things, it was implied that he would be coming over after I left for work, not an hour and a half before. Dahlia later claimed that she told me he was coming at 8, but I never remember her saying that, nor did she bring it up the several times we talked about when I'd have to leave for the office.

Later that evening, I messaged in our private discord that I really didn't like how I felt after being rushed out and that in the future, she shouldn't plan dates immediately after each other. She agreed and didn't talk more. The next day she didn't really talk in our messages or discord. She's not the type to be silent, so I started spiraling. On day 3, I reached out and used some emojis from the emoji code we developed for communicating feelings when we find it hard to talk. Eventually I was able to get her to start talking and she was upset at me because I felt rushed out and discarded. She also felt that I shouldn't have been as bothered by her cleaning on our date since I know she has anxiety about folks seeing her apartment for the first time. After a bit of back and forth, she eventually dropped that she and Bramble had had sex. That hurt a lot and I compared her to her ex who used to spring new sexual partners on her like that frequently. Her phone died shortly after, and I spiraled very hard for the next two days because again, her going silent isn't like her. I eventually asked to meet in person and try to talk. By this point, it was feeling very much like I'd been kicked out and replaced. She agreed, and I came over when she asked me to. I had thought things should be okay since I knew Bramble had spent the night with Sunflower because they were planning to have sex. Sunflower had given me the heads up that they were planning that the weekend before after they had had oral. I did not expect to see Bramble leaving Dahlia's apartment. Apparently he came by to give her a treat he'd bought for her.

When I went inside, things were tense between Dahlia and I. I sat on the couch and asked if we were okay. She said yes. I then asked if I could hug her and she said yes. I broke down and started bawling because I had been so worried that she had decided to end things with me. We talked a bit and agreed to have a more in depth talk later on our normal date night. When our date night came, I proposed trying to use something I'd heard about on a podcast for repairing relationships called Repair SHOP. Basically, each person takes time to explain the rupture from their point of view and includes their history that influenced their feelings and how they viewed the rupture. After both sides have shared their story and history, both sides take ownership for what they could have done better in the rupture. Lastly, both sides try to figure out how to prevent a similar rupture from happening again in the future. 

I explained how she had never told me he was coming over that early. If she had, I wouldn't have spent the night. Because of that, I felt like my time with her was unexpectedly cut short and that I was literally kicked out. Dahlia sleeping with Bramble without giving any indication that she was interested in that possibility was also a big blow. Especially since she claims to be demisexual. I later learned that Sunflower was also incredibly upset that Dahlia slept with Bramble as soon as she had started being intimate with him. Dahlia going quiet and not communicating afterwards also really hurt, especially because she has made such a big deal out of how hurt she gets if a partner goes silent on her. I tried to explain how all of this left me feeling broken and incredibly hurt. 

She explained that she was hurt that she felt like she'd tried to reconnect by conversing with me while she cleaned. She said that she'd reminded me that Bramble was coming over and insists she told me once that it would be at 8. I don't remember that and would have questioned why he was coming over that early. She was also upset that I felt discarded. She was also very hurt that I compared her to her ex. We agreed to not schedule back to back dates anymore and to try and be better at giving each other heads up if we have sexual interest in anyone. I also agreed to not compare her to her ex and to treat that as a hard limit for her.

I tried to go to a couple of events that Bramble was at after all of this, but I've found that he reminds me of just how hurt I was by all of this. I've made a boundary for myself that I won't go to any events with him because I do not like the feelings he brings up in me. This has meant that I've essentially had to leave the local kink community. I'm working with my therapist to try and understand all of the feelings that are coming up due to Bramble. I've never had this reaction to any of my metas before, but I've never had a partner start a relationship with my meta by making me feel kicked out and discarded either. 

My partners are upset that I've left the kink community due to not wanting to go to the same events as Bramble. They've been trying to pressure me into going and just ignoring him. I tried that, and it didn't work for me, which is why I chose to stop going to events. They are upset at me and saying that I'm making them choose between Bramble and I, especially for one off events. I feel bad for Sunflower as she had been very good about trying to give me heads up with how things were moving with her and Bramble so that I wouldn't be caught by surprise like Dahlia did to me. But being around Bramble, even if we're not directly interacting, brings up feelings of pain and hurt and betrayal. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to give in and ignore a boundary I've set for myself just to make my partners' lives easier. I've made a lot of progress on being less codependent, and that feels like that would just be diving headfirst back into codependency. I don't know if Dahlia fully understands just how hurt I was by her and Bramble. Dahlia and I had been talking about becoming nesting primary partners, but I think we have bigger issues to work through before we can go back to those talks.

I have no doubt she loves me, I have no doubt she thinks about me.  
She has problems understanding boundaries.

First incident was when both of us went to Tokyo on business trip, decided to stay in the same hotel after our things finish at around 21:00 at night. She suddenly said that she wanted to meet with her co-workers from previous job (male) since she cant meet them ever again probably. I didnt know they were male, but said ok if its just a chit chat and a coffee. Then at 21:00 I was in front of the hotel but she was not there. Turns out she was getting drunk with her co-worker and asked me to go pick her up. I told her she dont need to come to hotel, to me. and I will send her luggage to her house. Said she can stay with him. She insisted and called me, I wasnt gonna go pick her up, but i was worried for her welfare, so i picked her up and took her back to hotel. Decided to break up the day after. But I didnt. This was 4 months ago. After this incident, I told her to not do this kind of things (going out drinking with other males. Also, it turns out halfway through her meeting with her co-worker, he asked her to go to hotel to have sex. and after that, she continued sitting and drinking with him.)

Second incident is after 2 months, she hosted a colleague of hers in her house. Male, 5 years younger than her. I know the guy as well. She lives in a village, big house. Turns out the reason was to show him the farm, and do something for his research. Whatever, she then tells me that how she massaged his shoulders because he was looking exhausted.

After the second incident, we had another fight about our interactions with opposite gender, she strictly barred me from only texting my only female friend here in japan. and in return, she agreed to not be alone with males and not to go drinking with males. Not talking with males except only one male from her hometown where she has been friends with since highschool. I agreed. But after this agreement, I am 100% sure she had talks/msging with other males and went on 'business' dates but she assured me there was no alcohol.

**Third incident was yesterday**, I went to her house, riding 2 hours train, carrying my worklaptop to work. And after 6pm yesterday, we went to a cooking class where she was the teacher. (My mom knows she is a cooking class teacher so she handcrafted an apron for her. fancy and delicate one. It's her first present from my mom and I never saw her wearing it.) Now, we arrived at the class, she started preparing, some customers arrived, and one of them was 185cm tall japanese male. Her junior from her university. Aperantly, he didnt have an apron, me neither. So what she does? She seperates the two piece handmade apron sent from another country for her, from my mom and gives one piece to me and other piece to the japanese boy. (which was sick, and didnt have the most hygenic standards.) and she herself wears a random basic apron.

fast forward to the end of lesson, she tries to feed me some leftover food. I refuse, since i already ate too much. She then proceeds to that japanese guy in front of me, and hadn fed him with the same spoon the she ate in front of me.

Now, after this, she was supposed to take me to the train station, apparently, her juinor also need to take the same train, so she offers him a ride as well. At this point, I am too tired of her bs and refuse the ride and walk to the station. She cuts me off as i try to enter the station.

We argue, she blames me for making such a fuss about this whole ordeal. Apologies and acknowledges how important was the apron etc.

And as a last part, I yell at her 'Since the start of this relationship, I %100 respected our love, your needs. I ditched my only girl friend just so you feel happy and not sad. But here you are, not even showing the 10% of the respect I show to you and our love.'

And told her that i will be going. I enter the train station, she waits outside, the same posture, standing still, for the coming 30 minutes. I think the last 10 minutes, she faced the tracks. I think she could see me.

I go back home, she calls, (I am sure she was crying the whole time standing there, and for the next 2 hours as I was going back home.) We talk, not much. She says she is so hurt, says she did something bad but she isnt that evil person. Isnt someone who will cheat.

Now this kind of arguments, (another example, I find Tinder application on her phone 2 months ago but I only saw it just barely so i wasnt sure it was it. I continued discreetly watching her phone, and tinder app was on her main screen on her phone. I confronted her 2 days ago, and my confrontation was like 'why is this app in your phone' her defence was that she didnt know. She never saw it. I asked 'you didnt see the app on your main screen for 2 months?' her reply was 'i kinda see it but didnt pay attention to it, as i have been busy the whole time.' her claim is, the app installed itself magically (because after meeting through tinder 8 months ago, i made her delete the app.) the argument continues, I try to be as not confronting as possible. then I got blamed for not believing her.)

Then yesterday, she says we are having too much fights like this everyday. and each day is just too painful. She cries all the time. And says she loves me but wants to end it. I didn't say anything.

I breaks my heart into pieces seeing, hearing her cry. 

I’m not looking for a verdict on who is right or wrong.  
I’m struggling to understand whether this relationship can be healthy given repeated boundary issues, and how people have handled similar situations.

Out of nowhere, I received a follow request from someone who honestly was my type but i never know that but probably not the “best” kind of person on paper personally i avoided that kind of men. But he treated me in a way that felt special, and that’s what drew me in. We shared similar cultural references, interests, and ways of seeing the world. That familiarity made me feel like home

There was a period where I barely slept for an entire month. I didn’t leave the house at all, and I was under intense academic pressure. He noticed how exhausted I was

Even though he could be emotionally distant at times and carried a certain coldness, he showed up and talked to me, comforted me, and quite literally pulled me out of that dark phase almost against my will. In many ways, he helped put my life back together.

It felt like he saw me not the chaos around my life, not the random details but me, Dodi. He knew me, remembered me, understood me.

But he had a habit he would deactivate his social media accounts and disappear for periods of time, usually he warned me beforehand 

One day, I woke up and he was gone completely, no warning, no explanation. I panicked and I reached out to people who knew him, only to hear the same confusion echoed back at me, then, out of nowhere, a new and unfamiliar account messaged me saying “Dodi. This is my new number I’m sorry I didn’t give it to you I was going through something .”

Even then, people we both knew were asking me where he was. He had disappeared from everyone’s life but came to me in the middle of his mess. He never intentionally hurt me. He was always gentle with me. He woke me up in the mornings, brought me breakfast and coffee, encouraged me, believed in me deeply. He was incredibly close to me.

Then one day, a huge conflict happened between us. He said something deeply hurtful. I couldn’t handle it I snapped. He felt guilty and did what he always did… but this time, he disappeared completely, for an entire year.

No one knew where he was. Truly no one. This week, I started thinking about him in an unusually intense way stronger than ever before, then I saw someone on social media who looked exactly like him. It was unsettling, for a moment, I was convinced it was him.

After a whole year, I checked my account that i always use, the one that i used to talk to him on, i found that his account is back!!

I panicked, i messaged him right away, he still didn’t reply, im so scared, ong i miss the soulmate thing that we had, but i don’t know what will happen, i’ll keep u guys updated",1,1765851899.0,Situationships,0,1.0,False

Said she can stay with him. She insisted and called me, I wasnt gonna go pick her up, but i was worried for her welfare, so i picked her up and took her back to hotel. Decided to break up the day after. But I didnt. This was 4 months ago. After this incident, I told her to not do this kind of things (going out drinking with other males. Also, it turns out halfway through her meeting with her co-worker, he asked her to go to hotel to have sex. and after that, she continued sitting and drinking with him.)

Second incident is after 2 months, she hosted a colleague of hers in her house. Male, 5 years younger than her. I know the guy as well. She lives in a village, big house. Turns out the reason was to show him the farm, and do something for his research. Whatever, she then tells me that how she massaged his shoulders because he was looking exhausted. 

After the second incident, we had another fight about our interactions with opposite gender, she strictly barred me from only texting my only female friend here in japan. and in return, she agreed to not be alone with males and not to go drinking with males. Not talking with males except only one male from her hometown where she has been friends with since highschool. I agreed. But after this agreement, I am 100% sure she had talks/msging with other males and went on 'business' dates but she assured me there was no alcohol. 

**Third incident was yesterday**, I went to her house, riding 2 hours train, carrying my worklaptop to work. And after 6pm yesterday, we went to a cooking class where she was the teacher. (My mom knows she is a cooking class teacher so she handcrafted an apron for her. fancy and delicate one. It's her first present from my mom and I never saw her wearing it.)  Now, we arrived at the class, she started preparing, some customers arrived, and one of them was 185cm tall japanese male. Her junior from her university. Aperantly, he didnt have an apron, me neither. So what she does? She seperates the two piece handmade apron sent from another country for her, from my mom and gives one piece to me and other piece to the japanese boy. (which was sick, and didnt have the most hygenic standards.) and she herself wears a random basic apron. 

fast forward to the end of lesson, she tries to feed me some leftover food. I refuse, since i already ate too much. She then proceeds to that japanese guy in front of me, and hadn fed him with the same spoon the she ate in front of me. 

Now, after this, she was supposed to take me to the train station, apparently, her juinor also need to take the same train, so she offers him a ride as well. At this point, I am too tired of her bs and refuse the ride and walk to the station. She cuts me off as i try to enter the station. 

We argue, she blames me for making such a fuss about this whole ordeal. Apologies and acknowledges how important was the apron etc. 

And as a last part, I yell at her 'Since the start of this relationship, I %100 respected our love, your needs. I ditched my only girl friend just so you feel happy and not sad. But here you are, not even showing the 10% of the respect I show to you and our love.'

And told her that i will be going. I enter the train station, she waits outside, the same posture, standing still, for the coming 30 minutes. I think the last 10 minutes, she faced the tracks. I think she could see me. 

I go back home, she calls, (I am sure she was crying the whole time standing there, and for the next 2 hours as I was going back home.) We talk, not much. She says she is so hurt, says she did something bad but she isnt that evil person. Isnt someone who will cheat. 

Now this kind of arguments, (another example, I find Tinder application on her phone 2 months ago but I only saw it just barely so i wasnt sure it was it. I continued discreetly watching her phone, and tinder app was on her main screen on her phone. I confronted her 2 days ago, and my confrontation was like 'why is this app in your phone' her defence was that she didnt know. She never saw it. I asked 'you didnt see the app on your main screen for 2 months?' her reply was 'i kinda see it but didnt pay attention to it, as i have been busy the whole time.' her claim is, the app installed itself magically (because after meeting through tinder 8 months ago, i made her delete the app.) the argument continues, I try to be as not confronting as possible. then I got blamed for not believing her.)

Then yesterday, she says we are having too much fights like this everyday. and each day is just too painful. She cries all the time. And says she loves me but wants to end it. I didn't say anything. 

I breaks my heart into pieces seeing, hearing her cry. But AITAH? Sorry for the wall of text.

1pnqa0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1pnqa0l/asked_ai_to_tell_me_what_the_meta_seo_writing/,"Asked AI to tell me what the ''meta'' SEO writing rules are, does this match your experience?","Yes—there *is* a “meta” writing style that tends to win in SEO right now, and it’s less about tricks and more about **people-first clarity + evidence + predictable structure**.

# The meta writing style search engines are nudging everyone toward

The direction is: **write to help a real person complete a task**, and make it easy for systems to understand what your page is about. That means content that’s original, specific, and demonstrates **E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trust)**—especially on anything that impacts health, money, safety, or major life decisions.

Practically, the “style” looks like:

* **Answer-first**: give the direct answer / main takeaway near the top (then expand).
* **Task framing**: “Here’s what you’ll do / choose / avoid” rather than long intros.
* **Concrete proof**: examples, steps, screenshots, numbers, sources, author credentials, methodology.
* **Scannability**: tight headings that match how people search; short sections; lists; tables where useful.
* **No filler**: remove fluff that exists “because SEO.”

# Must-know do’s (writing)

**Do write like you’re trying to be the best single page for that query.**

* Make the page’s purpose obvious and satisfy the intent completely (definition → steps → edge cases → alternatives → troubleshooting).
* Add “only-you” value: firsthand experience, original examples, templates, opinions grounded in practice.
* Use descriptive H2/H3s that mirror real sub-questions (these often map to long-tail queries).
* Keep intros short; earn the scroll with immediate utility.

**Do give Google clean “packaging.”**

* **Title tag**: accurate, specific, not stuffed, consistent with on-page headings.
* **Meta description**: treat it like ad copy for the click—summarize value honestly and make it unique per page.
* Use clear page structure (one main topic per page, logical headings, consistent terminology).

# Must-know don’ts (writing)

**Don’t do “SEO theater.”** Common losers:

* Keyword-stuffed sentences, repetitive headings, or awkward synonym swapping just to “rank for more.”
* Generic intros (“In today’s world…”) and filler sections that don’t help someone decide/do something.
* Clickbait titles that don’t deliver what the page promises.

**Don’t scale content that doesn’t add value.**

* Mass-producing pages that repeat what’s already out there (even if “unique wording”) tends to underperform and can create quality risks.

# Tiny templates you can steal

**Title tag (safe pattern)**  
`Primary intent keyword: Outcome + Specific qualifier | Brand`  
Example: `Cold Brew Ratio: 3 Reliable Recipes (1:4, 1:6, 1:8) | Acme Coffee`

**Meta description (CTR pattern)**  
`What it is + who it’s for + proof/benefit + what they’ll get (step/template/tool).`  
Example: `Dial in cold brew with 3 tested ratios, grind sizes, and steep times—plus a quick checklist for sour/bitter batches.`

# Quick self-audit (60 seconds)

If someone lands on the page and reads only:

* the title,
* the first screen,
* the H2s,
* and one example…

…will they (1) trust you, and (2) feel like they can finish their task without opening five other tabs?

I have a family history (dad) of it. I was put on sulfasalazine for a handful of years but it eventually lost its effectiveness and I went into a flare. Then I switched to azathioprine and it gave me pancreatitis, so I switched again. Next I went on Humira for another 5-6 years. In 2020, while a sophomore in college, I decided to stop taking it and go med-free without my doctor’s supervision.

I haven’t had any symptoms until this past summer, when I noticed some blood in my stool. Because of this, I decided to get a colonoscopy in September. **It showed no signs of inflammation and the blood in my stool was actually caused by hemorrhoids.** The doctor told me I “no longer had UC”, which I know is not how it works, and told me I didn’t have to get another colonoscopy until I am 45 like the general population unless I showed symptoms again.

I smoked a lot of weed through college up until recently, and with its anti-inflammatory effects, I wonder if this was keeping the UC at bay. I don’t smoke anymore because it was becoming problematic for me, so I hope I continue to be asymptomatic without it. 

I eat a decently healthy diet but don’t avoid any foods. I drink alcohol every few weeks, but was a pretty big binge drinker on the weekends in college. I drink coffee daily (2-3 cups). I exercise almost daily, usually for about 45 mins to an hour, alternating between strength training and aerobic exercise like running or swimming. I have a somewhat stressful job as a software engineer. 

Wanted to share in case someone is looking for hope. Things on here can be pretty negative because people that are struggling post more than those who are doing fine. Yes, it can always come back, but I don’t think about it much. Toodles!",3,1765851640.0,UlcerativeColitis,6,0.57,False

The house is bigger than I expected. I knew they’d be posh, or they couldn’t afford a nanny in the first place. But they have fancy agencies for that sort of thing now; someone with this sort of money doesn’t need to advertise on a Facebook group. I fold the cuff of my cardigan over, so that the ripped hem doesn’t show, and deposit the half-drunk Greggs takeaway latte in the neighbours’ wheelie bin. I should have splurged for a Starbucks. It might have distracted from my grown-out roots and chipped nail varnish. 

Mum insisted I start looking for work. I finished college 8 months ago. It was a struggle by the end, but Mum had insisted that after the debacle that was high school, by hell or high water I was going to get my certificate. And hell it was. In the peace that followed the chaos and stress that got me my qualification, I went into freefall. I stopped going out. Stopped washing. Stopped eating. I lost contact with the few friends who hadn’t gone off to uni and spent 8 months of my life watching the 24 hour Come Dine With Me channel on Mum’s smart TV. Finally, Mum had put her foot down. I needed to pay rent. Nana’s inheritance was nearly gone, and Mum wanted to put the rest of it towards Natasha’s pregnancy. Benefits were out of the question; Mum was mortified at the idea of the neighbours seeing DWP envelopes sticking out of our post slot. I wasn’t convinced that anyone but Mum paid that much attention to other people’s business on the estate, but she was determined to never come across as ‘pikey’. 

I grew up on an estate. Housing provided by the council, which was Mum’s greatest shame. When Nana died, Mum had been given a sizable inheritance. No one had known how much Nana had packed into a tear in her mattress, but Grandad had apparently been far richer than he let on. Mum told everyone Nana didn’t trust the banks, or that she had a hoarding problem from growing up in the Blitz. I suspect the truth was that the Department of Work and Pensions were unlikely to investigate her mattress. Mum used the money to move us further out of London, to an ex-council house she was able to buy outright. It was the only ex-council property on the estate, and Mum wore that like a badge of honour. Tash had taken to our new home instantly, decorating her room with half of B&M and almost instantly finding a job at a beautician’s clinic in the gentrified part of town. In no time, she was able to move into her own place, sharing with the new boyfriend she’d met at work, and my little sister was an engaged, pregnant aesthetician-in-training. I, on the other hand, got my GCSEs four years late and barely made it through a childcare course.

I hadn’t expected to get the job. Mum had gotten suspicious of the way I cradled my phone to my chest whenever she asked about my job applications, and had finally sat me down in front of her laptop and watched me apply for several babysitting jobs until she was satisfied. She’d been especially invested in this one for the prestige of the ‘nanny’ title, and I’d spent a gruelling hour and half fine-tuning my cover letter with her until she agreed that it was perfect. Tash’s future baby became a living, breathing infant that I had spent the last 8 months caring for, with Tash prematurely taking on her fiance’s surname so that the reference seemed impartial. I hadn’t expected it to fool anyone; especially with the flowery language Mum had insisted on (I liked kids, but calling them ‘the most valuable and precious gift we have’ in a job application seemed a bit much), but sure enough, I received a reply a week later. I’d already confirmed another job, just a few school pick-ups a week for a woman on the estate who had left a flyer on the community board, but Mum made me cancel. The wage that was quoted in the Facebook post was not worth sacrificing for the scraps of Debbie’s giro, she’d said. 

So, here I am; barely able to care for myself, being interviewed to keep another tiny, fragile human warm and fed. Hoping that my outfit was bought too long ago to be recognised as Primark, I take a deep breath and knock. It’s a proper brass ring doorknocker, and it makes an impressive, resonant rap on the solid, varnished wood of the door. I wait. And wait. I wrestle with the choice of knocking again and risking seeming impatient, or continuing to wait for someone to answer a knock they hadn’t heard. Eventually, I remember that I didn’t want this job in the first place, and am about to head to the Starbucks to camp out until I can return home and tell Mum that they’d wanted someone with more experience, when the door opens. 

She’s not much older than I am; even the heavy bags under her eyes can’t mask her youth. She peers at me from below an unwashed blonde fringe, her bare face smattered with freckles. Pretty, but exhausted. 

I plaster a smile on my face, and she asks, ‘Are you Abby?’ 

‘Yes- I’m Abigail, nice to meet you.’ I’d been given strict instructions to use my full name. As if nicknames were too common for rich folk. 

‘Come in.’ Her voice is flat, and she turns away to walk into the house. I ignore Mum’s rule about not entering until I’m invited, and hurry after her, closing the front door behind me. 

The house is a mess. Not the same sort of mess you find on a council estate; piled up newspapers dating back to the 60s in the home of the pensioner who’d died in his flat, or the carpets stained with dog shit from the couple running a puppy mill in their smoke-stained semi-detached. But certainly not the hoover lines and carefully placed trinkets of my mother’s house. Mum would have complimented her on her beautiful house, only to shoot me a look that said ‘I guess money *can’t* buy class’ as soon as her back was turned. There are piles of laundry scattered about like landmines, crumbs on every surface, and half-drunk cups of tea that must account for the faint wafts of mold that my nose keeps catching.

‘Sorry about the mess.’ she says apologetically, and I raise my eyebrows as if surprised that she’d felt the need to mention it. ‘I’m a first-time mum. Apparently it’s normal.’ She speaks in short bursts, like even connecting her thoughts is too much effort. 

‘I understand- of course. Not that it’s bad; it’s fine! It’s a lovely home.’ I add hurriedly, and hope that she takes my stammering attempt at defusing the awkwardness in good faith. 

She doesn’t even seem to notice. 

‘Her dad decided he didn’t want kids after all, just after she was born. I wasn’t planning on being a single mum.’ There’s a melancholy in her voice, which hangs in the air around us. Honestly, I’m a little shocked at her candour. Mum says oversharing is dreadfully common, but there’s nothing common about a house this size, in this part of town. I guess the more unfavourable parts of your history become quirky and romantically tragic when you’re rich. She wouldn’t have let me step foot in the door if she knew some of the skeletons in *my* closet. 

‘I’m sorry.’ I say, unsure of what else would be appropriate. Anna blinks, seemingly snapping herself out of her daze. 

‘No, *I’m* sorry.’ she says, her voice a little clearer now. ‘I’ve not slept enough. It feels like I’m going mad most days.’ She takes a deep breath. ‘Let’s start again. I’m Anna.’

She holds a hand out to me, and I take it, shaking it limply. ‘Abigail.’ I murmur. She seems crackers. And I’d know. 

‘Abigail.’ she repeats, a warm, practiced smile spreading over her face. ‘Abigail, as you can see, I need some help.’ 

‘Yes.’ I say, without thinking. ‘I mean- no, that’s not what I meant.’ 

Anna chuckles. ‘I’m not offended. Obviously, I need help, that’s why I posted the advert. Do you have much experience with babies?’ 

Loaded question. ‘Some. My qualification is fairly recent, but I’ve been taking care of babies since my sister was born.’ It’s not a lie; I helped Mum change Tash’s nappy at least twice when she was little, and I babysat for the neighbours a few times after I dropped out of school. Anna doesn’t need to know that my experience amounts to ‘enthusiastic amateur’ (although, ‘enthusiastic’ might be a stretch). 

‘Do you like babies?’ Anna asks. I’ve practiced this question with Mum enough times. 

‘I *love* babies. Before my little sister, I used to dress up my Nan’s old dog in a bonnet and push her around in a doll pram.’ We laugh at this adorable, fabricated story. Bitsy was a shit of a dog, and I’d have lost a finger if I’d tried dressing her up. 

‘I always wanted to be a mum.’ Anna says, dreamily. ‘I didn’t think it would happen so soon, but nature took its course, and I decided I didn’t want to wait.’  

*How lovely to have the option* I think, bitterly. I clench my teeth, as if biting back that nasty, unwarranted thought. Anna seems so sweet, and my family baggage isn’t her fault. 

‘Do you live here alone?’ I ask, though I’ve not seen any evidence of another adult. I can’t imagine what she does to afford living here without a housemate. 

‘Just me and Ruthie.’ Anna confirms. ‘Her Dad and I moved in a few years ago. If it were up to me, we’d have bought somewhere more remote. If it was up to him, we’d have been slap-bang in the middle of the city. This was our compromise.’ she smiles sadly. ‘I guess I should have insisted.’ 

‘So, you own it?’ I ask. I’m still so curious about her circumstances. 

Anna blushes a bit, avoiding my eyes. ‘I’ve been very privileged.’ she says, evasively. 

Ah. Family money. 

‘Shall we head upstairs? You can meet her.’ Anna suggests, clearly eager to change the subject.

I follow Anna up a carpeted staircase, noting the dust and hair gathered in the crevasses of the steps, the slight stickiness on certain points of the banister. From my experience, people in houses like this either get a cleaner in twice a week and keep it like a museum, or they stuff it to the rafters with crap in some vague attempt to feel down-to-earth and worldly. Anna seems to be a rare anomaly; Not regimented enough for column A, but nowhere near column B. Yet. I suppose single-motherhood will decide it for her. 

The nursery is clearly Anna’s main focus - a sparkling white tooth in a mouth full of cavities. Pristine, tidy, and decorated in soft muted pastels. Soft classical music floats out of a high-end speaker, barely loud enough to discern. Anna, too, changes; her harried exhaustion turned to a blissful languidness. She drifts over to the painted wood crib, old-fashioned but clearly safeguarded for modern sleeping standards. 

‘Good morning, sweet Ruthie.’ Anna sings, reaching her arm into the crib. She smiles at some unseen reaction, and beckons me over, not taking her eyes off her daughter. 

‘I want you to meet Abby- sorry, Abigail.’ She shoots an apologetic glance at me, before turning her attention back to Ruth. Eager to see the baby now, I step forward and lean to see over the crib’s edge. 

I feel the smile slowly fall off my face as I try to comprehend what I’m seeing. In the crib, lying on a mattress with a soft, pink sheet, is a plastic baby doll. Large, painted eyes staring permanently into space, plastic fingers curled into loose fists. 

It’s a joke. Any second now, she’ll straighten up, sneer at me for thinking I could ever work for someone like her, then laugh me out of the house. Maybe point out a hidden camera that had captured the realisation on my face. I wait. Anna doesn’t laugh, and when I glance over at her, she’s still smiling beatifically at the plastic facsimile of her daughter. 

‘I can’t believe she’s mine.’ Anna whispers, her voice thick with emotion. ‘Why didn’t your Daddy want to be in your life, eh? Stupid Daddy.’ 

She straightens up then, squeezes her knuckle to a rapidly forming tear in her left eye. ‘Sorry, I’m just being silly. She’s due for a feed, wait here with her while I get her bottle.’

I wait for her to leave the room, then go back to the crib and stare at the fake Ruthie. She’s dressed in a onesie - lilac with puppies frozen in various dancing positions. 

There had been a girl on my childcare course like this - overweight and soft spoken, she brought in a silicone baby doll on her first day. She’d sit in the front row, rocking the thing with one arm while she took notes with the other, steadfastly ignoring the whispers and giggles and stares. She hadn’t made it through the second week - she didn’t turn up on the next Wednesday, and we never saw her again. I hadn’t been very kind to her, something I regretted greatly when I started researching reborn dolls, and the way they were used for dementia patients, grieving mothers and traumatised children. I had an idea of which category Anna fell into, but was again surprised by the thriftiness of her choice of doll. Most people paid into the thousands to get the most realistic, hand-painted doll they could find. Real hair, not molded plastic, and articulated limbs that could be manoeuvered into any position an actual baby could make, instead of the rigid, bent elbows of Anna’s baby. She looks like the sort of doll you could buy at Toys R Us. I’d have thought that someone of Anna’s standing could at least afford something from Hamleys.

Fascinated, I reach a hand into the crib, plucking at the fabric of the onesie. This, at least, feels like good quality; soft, warm cotton. I pass my hand over the doll’s face, as if I can snap the toy out of its inanimate state. The eyes continue to stare into space. Some impulsion grabs me, and I poke my finger into one of the painted pupils. 

‘Like clockwork!’ Anna says behind me, bustling into the room. I jump, snatching my hand back guiltily. Poking babies in the eyes, real or fake, is unlikely to secure me the job. ‘If I’m even a minute late for her feed, she screams the house down!’

She hurries over to the crib, bottle in hand, placing her hand on the chest of the toy as if soothing it. I watch, feeling awkward. 

‘There, now.’ she intones in her soft, sing-song voice. ‘Mummy’s got your milky.’ 

I cringe at that. What is this? Is it a fetish thing? She’s not the usual demographic of pervert you’d expect. But maybe that’s stereotyping; maybe perverts can be young, pretty, middle-class women, too. Or maybe she’s just batty, like the girl on my course. I watch as she lifts ‘Ruthie’ out of the crib with such care, such love. I guess crazy’s better than sexual.

‘She’s a hungry girl.’ she says, tipping the bottle to the doll’s mouth. For a few seconds, she just stands there, bottle in hand, staring adoringly down into the plastic baby in her arms. Then, shushing placatingly, she pulls the bottle away and holds it out to me.

‘Do you want to try?’ she asks. I think about saying no, about making some polite excuse, then getting the hell out of there. But then, how hard can it be to look after a fake baby? Surely not as hard as looking after a real one. If I can keep Anna sweet, this could be an easier scam than Nana’s pension. 

‘I’d love to.’ I say, smiling warmly. I take the bottle, and let her gently transfer the doll into my arms. She’s heavy for a doll - probably weighted for realism. Summoning all of my physical improv skills, I guide the nipple of the bottle to the doll’s mouth. On instinct, I squeeze the bottle ever-so-slightly, and milk runs into the channel of its plastic lips and dribbles down its face.

Instantly, Anna swoops in, plucking her baby out of my arms.

‘Oh, not too much! Like I said, she’s a good feeder, so she’ll get enough by herself.’

I don’t know why I’m so embarrassed. I’m not the freak giving a Baby Born real milk. I wonder if it’s real breast milk. Surely not, right? But if she lost the real Ruthie, like I suspect she did, then all that milk has to go somewhere. I surreptitiously wipe a few droplets of milk off my hand with my cardigan, and make a mental note to wash it as soon as I can. 

‘You don’t mind if I change her, do you?’ she asks, once she’s finished with her little play-pretend feeding. 

‘Of course not.’ I say, faintly. How much weirder is this going to get? Anna has a whole changing station; beautifully engraved, varnished wood, probably Victorian. 6-year old me would be green with envy - It’s like she has a life-sized dollhouse. Ruthie looks even more fake and plastic against the antique wood. 

‘Stinky girl.’ Anna coos, kissing the doll’s tummy and twiddling its feet. I watch as she gathers everything from the drawers under the changing table - wipes, baby powder, a fresh flannel and a small box of nappy pins. 

‘Have you ever changed a cloth nappy?’ Anna asks. 

It was part of my childcare course, but I don’t want to risk embarrassing myself like I did with the bottle, so I say,

‘My last job thought disposable nappies were more hygienic.’ 

Anna rolls her eyes and chuckles. ‘That’s crazy. Reusable nappies are so much better, for baby and for the environment. Watch me.’ 

Hesitantly, I step towards her. She’s not just going through the motions; she’s fully committed to the act. She sings to Ruthie, walking her fingers down the plastic torso and carefully undoing the nappy pin. She unfolds the nappy, and I gasp, stepping back.

Anna laughs, folding the nappy in on itself. ‘Apparently, we Mums have weird hormones that make us think it smells delicious and buttery. I forget it must smell like death to everyone else.’

I don’t know how I didn’t smell it before. The nappy is full - not of plastic or paint or some other sort of faked substance, but of human excrement. It must have been in there the whole time, even when she was briefly in my arms. How I hadn’t smelled the fetid mess when it was literally under my nose, I’m not sure.

Unfazed, Anna drops the dirty nappy in a small, lidded basket by her feet, and continues her task.

‘The boil wash only takes an hour, and I usually put them on once a day. I wouldn’t leave it more than that, they pile up quickly. Just make sure you don’t put anything else in with them.’

I think, then, about Anna wiping herself with the cloth and pinning the messy nappy onto her fake daughter, multiple times a day. I feel sick. 

‘Where’s your loo?’ I ask, hurriedly. Mum would be mortified to hear me call it a ‘loo’ instead of a ‘WC’ or whatever other ridiculous genteel name she’d want me to use, but at this point, I risk dry-heaving if I open my mouth to correct myself. 

‘Down the hall,’ Anna says, pointing, a coy smile playing at the corner of her lips. I walk out, trying not to look too much like I’m dashing for it. Anna’s laughter echoes after me.

‘You’ll get used to it, I swear!’

\-

I’m not sick, thankfully, but the lavender scent of the bleach is giving me a bit of a headache. Anna must have done a quick clean of the toilet before I arrived, as the bottle is still perched on the cistern. I didn’t know rich people had a fancy alternative to Toilet Duck. I take a quick drink out of the tap, splashing some cold water on my wrists so that I don’t ruin my makeup. I look at myself in the mirror. I’d thought I looked quite nice when I left the house, but compared to Anna, even in her tired, unwashed state, I do just look a bit…cheap. My cardigan *does* look ratty; Mum was right. 

Still, maybe that’s my appeal. An agency nanny would have reported her right away. Whether this is genuine delusion, or just wanting someone to play along, some chavvy girl from Facebook is more likely to suck it up for the money than an actual professional. 

I can do this. 13 days, the advert said. Not even a fortnight. 13 days on my own; free from Mum, free from responsibility. Just me and a fake, shit-covered baby with a huge house to ourselves. 

When I step out, I’m a new Abby. *This* is Abigail, the confident, reassuring amateur nanny who fields questions and coos at Anna’s baby like she’s been doing this for years. *Period cramps*, I say to explain away my hesitance from earlier, and the badly-covered nausea. *I only get them for a day or two, but they’re murder every time!* Anna, pleasantly surprised at my complete about-face, nods sympathetically. Hers were awful up until she got pregnant, so she knows my pain. 

We spend the better part of an hour just chatting away - abandoning instructions mid-way to go on some unrelated tangent. I get the feeling we’re both a bit starved of connection with women our own age.

By the time I’m on her doorstep, waving back as Anna waggles Ruthie’s crooked arm up and down, we’ve abandoned the pretense of *if* I’m chosen for the job altogether. I have the dates blocked out on my calendar, and an invitation to stay the night before, so I don’t have to brave the traffic of the morning commute. I leave feeling *good,* truly good. I have a job. I have prospects. 

The shock on Mum’s face when I tell her I got it is too satisfying to be hurtful. 

\-

I’m back on Anna’s doorstep a week later. The childcare course was pretty much redundant by the time Mum had seen me off; my door nearly swung off its hinges with how much she kept coming in to remind me of some piece of common sense I was surely too stupid to know. 

Anna welcomes me warmly, but she looks even more tired than I remember. I expected that we might stay up a little while, maybe nurture the sparks of friendship I felt at my interview. But Anna announces an early night as soon as she’s taken me through the general housekeeping and reminded me of my duties. I’m a little deflated, but mostly hungry. It’s only 8pm, and I’d thought she might make dinner, or at least order something in. But I forgot that rich people are on different time - she must have eaten early, and I don’t mention that I haven’t, in case it’s considered uncouth. 

I ‘feed’ Ruthie her evening bottle while Anna gets ready for bed. The plastic eyes are a little unnerving, but she’s not quite as uncanny valley as she felt when I first saw her. I suppose now the shock has subsided, she feels more like a toy, and less like she might be haunted. 

Later, when I’ve retreated to my temporary bedroom, I find half a sleeve of Polo mints in the front pocket of my rucksack; so that’s dinner sorted.

\-

I sleep well on Anna’s expensive spare mattress. It’s amazing how it affects your quality of sleep when you’re not on second-hand box springs. Refreshed, I get up to do a quick blitz of the house. I should do *something* while I’m here. I’ve always hated Mum’s weekend ‘spring cleans’, but without her over my shoulder every step of the way, it’s quite relaxing doing the tidying. If only Mum didn’t think cleaning for money was skivvy work, I’d probably be better suited to that than childcare. 

Anna’s already gone, a half-drunk coffee and some crumbs by the sink, evidence of a last-minute dash out of the house. I find a note scrawled on the back of a receipt on the hallway table while I’m hoovering. Her phone number, and the closest A&E. Better than nothing, I suppose. 

By 11am, all the laundry piles have been consolidated, sorted, and are either in the machine or waiting in a nearby basket. Thankfully, the nappy wash has already been done, the cloths drying on the line outside. I’ve washed the couple of dirty dishes in the sink, and put away what was in the dishwasher. Hoovering done, all spills wiped up. The house is hardly spotless, but it’s neat and tidy in a way that I’m sure Anna will appreciate coming home to. There’s just one rather big task left to do.

I decide to commit to caring for Ruthie properly. Anna might be sick, but it’s clear she loves her ‘daughter’, and is paying me a lot of money to be here. The least I can do is play along. It’ll be good practice, if nothing else. 

Putting on my game face, I tiptoe into the nursery. 

‘Rise and shine!’ I say cheerily, opening the gauzy curtains above the crib. Warm morning light bathes Ruthie in an ethereal glow, and for a moment, she almost looks like a real baby. I stroke my knuckle down her cheek, and it’s soft. I pick her up, carefully supporting her head, and carry her over to the changing table. I check her nappy with some trepidation, but it’s clean, of course. I refasten the nappy pin, and leave it at that. 

I spend some time going through the miniature wardrobe that Anna has curated. The doll is better dressed than I am, but then I can’t afford to buy Monsoon, in baby or adult sizes. I spend a few minutes agonising over what to put her in - there are so many cute little outfits, and I’m tempted to try them all on her. Then, inspiration strikes. Anna will want photos, of course. My options are either to pick out a new outfit every day, and stage some activity with my plastic ward; or, I can get it all out of the way now. Stock up, so to speak. Plus, I’ll be getting paid to play dress up with a baby doll. 

I’d never had a lot of dolls as a kid, but I loved dressing up my Barbies with whatever clothes I’d found at the car boot sale that weekend. I learnt to sew so that I could make little dresses for them out of my old socks - shapeless sacks that had seemed like fashionable mini-dresses to my nine-year-old eyes. But this is a lot more fun. 

I work my way through Ruthie’s wardrobe. I start with pyjamas - easy enough to shoot; I arrange her in her crib, changing her position slightly each time. All of them sleep-safe, just in case. The light is even on a dimmer switch, so I have a nice selection of nap photos, bedtime photos and waking-up photos. Now for the real fun.

I catch myself singing to Ruthie as I dress her up; little nonsense rhymes that my Nan had sung to me, from some unknown origin. Elephants joining the circus and singing puppies and the like. Maybe I should go work in one of those baby photo studios instead of babysitting. All the dressing up and cute smiles, and none of the mess. 

However tiny the clothes are, it’s still time-consuming work. My fingers seem unusually clumsy fumbling with the tiny buttons. I’d have as hard a time dressing a real baby; it’s almost like the doll is evading me, squirming around in my grasp. But, I manage, and have an enjoyable afternoon staging my photoshoot around the house. Ruthie naps in my arms while I sit on the couch. She has tummy time with her soft toys. I even get a shot of her in her little baby bath, a miniature rubber duck tucked into her hand. Satisfied that I have enough photos to last the two weeks, I dry her plastic body off with a little pink towel, and go to find her one more outfit.

In the end, I decide on a black and white striped dungaree dress with a red love heart embroidered on the front. I stand Ruthie up in her finished outfit; making her do a little dance to show off her neat white socks and patent shoes. 

‘Let’s go for a walk.’ I tell her, the idea hitting me suddenly. I should get at least one picture of her outside. You wouldn’t leave a real baby cooped up inside for an entire fortnight; and for all intents and purposes, Ruthie is a real baby to Anna. 

I leave Ruthie on the floor of the nursery, even putting a little toy mouse next to her, like she might be bored otherwise, and creep into Anna’s bedroom. It’s my second time in there this morning, as I’d made her bed already. Still, I feel a little anxious in her room, like I’m not supposed to be there. But, if I’m here already, why not have a snoop? I open drawers and read book covers, careful not to leave any trace of my nosiness. Apart from the pair of pyjamas and couple of cardigans I picked up off the floor, her room seems surprisingly barren of clothes. She can’t have taken them all with her, and considering the size of Ruthie’s wardrobe, I can’t imagine Anna’s wearing the same few outfits over and over. It’s as I’m pondering this that I open the cupboard hidden behind her door, and answer my own question.

There’s a whole walk-in closet. Shelves of shoes like she’s in *Sex and The City*, and rails of beaded taffeta and soft cashmere, jewel-toned velvet and beige linens. I channel my inner *Vogue* editor and sort through the designer labels. 

I wonder if I’d have needed to be sectioned in the first place if I’d just had the money to be eccentric.

In the end, I can’t quite bring myself to go full Carrie Bradshaw, and Anna’s smaller than I am anyway; but I take a belt with a Chanel buckle, a Steve Madden handbag, and the iconic Ralph Lauren American flag jumper that must be too big on her. I get dressed, careful not to snag or stretch the jumper, and look at myself in Anna’s full-length closet mirror. The belt makes my jeans look expensive, and even my messy updo looks chic and effortless paired with my expensive accessories. I feel transformed, and I swan through the house like I own the place. I scoop Ruthie up from the nursery floor, and place her in the huge, fancy black pram by the front door. 

I’m so consumed in my little game of make-believe, that I don’t realise what I’m doing until I’m halfway down the road, half-a-dozen pictures snapped on my phone. I’m wearing stolen clothes and photographing a pram with a fake baby in it. These are not the actions of a young woman who is sane and thriving. I put my phone in my back pocket and grip the handle of the pram, trying not to give the game away, but I catch sight of myself in the reflection of a cafe window. I don’t look mad, I assure myself. I look like a normal woman taking her baby out for a walk. *I’m* not the one who thinks she’s real. A couple come out of the cafe, and the man holds the door open for me, flattening himself to the side to make room for the pram. 

*Go for it*. 

‘Thank you.’ I say, carefully pronouncing every letter, and push the pram inside. 

I order a coffee, and the barista smiles at me as she steams the milk.

‘How old?’ she asks, nodding at the pram. 

‘Three months.’ I say, without even thinking. The barista’s eyebrows raise, impressed.

‘Wow, you look incredible for having given birth three months ago!’ 

I think about going along with it, praising some mystery personal trainer for getting me back to my pre-baby weight in record time, but this is not my world, and I don’t want to get caught out. 

‘Oh, no. I’m just the nanny.’ 

She laughs. ‘Oh! I should have known; you look far too young to be someone’s Mum!’ 

I return a tight smile, thinking of my own Mum; fourteen and pregnant and working in a stock room. People were not so kind to her, as she tells it. No one told her she looked incredible, they just shot her dirty looks and muttered about the state of the world as she passed them. I pay for my coffee with minimal small talk, and manage a quiet *thank* *you* as I leave. 

I’m not Anna. I’m not a fashionable, wealthy young woman who can pass off a mental illness as a kooky little quirk; I’m working class, I’ve been sectioned before, and I need to get inside before someone notices that I’m treating a doll like a real baby. 

I take a sip of the tiny cup of coffee - too tiny for what I paid - and grimace. It’s not bitter, exactly, but there’s an odd taste there. *It’s probably what coffee actually tastes like*, I think. I’m used to Nescafe and Costa, not dry roasted or ethically-sourced Colombian coffee or whatever the hell I’m drinking. I take another sip, just so it doesn’t feel like a complete waste, and then dump it in a nearby bin. 

‘Let’s go home.’ I tell the doll, and reach for the pram. 

I almost make it back to Anna’s. *Almost*. But, a few houses down from hers, an elderly woman emerges from the front gate. No pearl-and-cardigan set on her; she’s wearing a sari and trousers, her streaky grey hair gathered in a long, thin plait that hangs down her left side. She’s hunched over, her back crooked and swollen with some sort of arthritis. As I attempt to manoeuvre the bulky pram around her, she claps her hands in delight.

‘Oh, a baby!’ she says, in accented English. ‘Let me see the baby.’ 

‘The b- oh, she’s sleeping.’ I stammer out. The woman just smiles, and taps her forefinger to her lips. Her fingers, too, are bent unnaturally. 

Ruthie, thank God, is mostly swaddled in a blanket; only her face peeking out. Still, there’s no mistaking her eyes for those of a real baby, and I have no desire to startle this poor woman, or worse, to cause a scene. 

I hope that she’ll just take a quick peep and let me on my way. But no, her gnarled hands reach into the pram, and to my horror, she peels the blanket back. Ruthie’s whole head is exposed, in all its fake glory. 

*Please don’t scream*, I think, heart thudding in my chest. But the woman doesn’t scream. She coos, and says something to the baby in some melodic, lilting language, tickling her under the chin. If at any point she notices that the baby isn’t real, she doesn’t mention it. 

‘Beautiful girl.’ she says, smiling warmly at me. I plaster on a smile back, nodding. I don’t know what to say. Maybe she knows Ruthie isn’t real, and is playing along to be kind. But, more likely, she’s an old, demented woman who’s too far gone to tell the difference anymore. I’m relieved when she finally puts the blanket back and goes on her way. I’m trembling as I reach the front door, and fumble with the key.

The air feels different once I’m inside. Cool and quiet. I hadn’t noticed how shaky my breathing was. I think back to my mindfulness strategies. Five things I can see; clock, pram, TV, rug and stairs. I run through the exercise automatically. Four things I can touch; jumper, pram, hair, door. It doesn’t feel like a panic attack; just anxiety. *That’s normal*, I remind myself. Just for good measure, three things I can hear; clock, car, fridge. I feel more in my body now. I leave Ruthie in the pram, and head upstairs, stripping off Anna’s clothes and putting them back as neatly as I can. 

If my twelve year old self could see me now, she’d be disgusted at how boring and fragile I’ve become. 

But then, if I could see her, I’d be terrified for her. 

I wasn’t a bad kid; but I was far from a sensible one. It feels like I went from watching The Tweenies after school and playing with Barbies to spending my evenings in the weed-smoke haze of Elliot’s flat within the blink of an eye, grimacing my way through glasses of cheap scotch to impress him and his loser pub friends. I’m still younger now than Elliot was then, and the thought of even looking at an eleven year old like that makes my skin crawl. *So what the hell was wrong with him?* 

I know what was wrong with him, of course. I didn’t spend the next five years of my life in therapy for no one to point out exactly what Elliot was doing to me. It took a long time to finally believe the counsellors when they told me *it wasn’t my fault.* In the moment, it felt like I knew what I was doing. I wasn’t a baby, after all, I was *twelve years old*. Practically an adult. Idiot. 

I’m in my head. I know which road this leads down, and I’m not in the mood. I rummage through my bag for my headphones, turn on the wordiest rap I can find, and crank the volume up on my phone. Noise is peace, ironically. 

\-

I sleep deeply, but wake up from a nightmare with my heart pounding. The memory of the nightmare flashes in my head only for a second before slipping out of my grasp, and I’m left to calm myself down without knowing why I need to.

Breakfast is usually a coffee and my meds, a slice of toast if I’m hungry. But I can’t work out Anna’s coffee machine; it’s a proper one, all dials and pipes, and real coffee grounds. I don’t dare go back to the coffee shop, and my exploration into Anna’s bread bin finds only the heel of a sourdough and a loaf of seeded rye. Yuck.

We all sat at different round tables, and it was a mox of people from my team and other teams. 

I had a young pretty redhead sit next to me that I have never met before.  I realized during lunch that I was more and more attracted to her, especially her personality.

We all talked about our Christmas plans. I realized my redhead friend is single from the discussion. 

Lunch ended, and we had two goofy table relationship building games to play, and then the luncheon was over. My new redhead friend left, and I dont know when I will ever see her around the office again.

I found her on Teams and the Employee Directory. I am tempted to message her on Teams and ask her to coffee. I am 45 male. I discovered through some FB research that she is older than I thought she was. She is old enough for me to date. She has to be around 30 F based on her college graduation date.

I’m after something real. Shared values, actual trust, long-term goals. Not into games, flings, or modern dating nonsense.

**About Me:** Music’s a big part of my life. I mostly listen to extreme metal, black and death metal stuff. Cradle of Filth is my favorite band, with Belphegor and Burzum right behind. I do vocals for fun and used to play with some guys (I have hit the drum set a couple times). Emperor's song With Strength I Burn probably has my favorite lyrics. You don’t have to love the music, but you’ll need to be okay with the sound, the shirts, and the wall art.

I work in IT, handling help desk support for the rest of the staff, and I’m starting to get into software security. I know tech pretty well but I don’t like to live online. I’ll scroll sometimes, but I’d rather be talking or watching something together than just sitting on our phones.

Been gaming since I was a kid. I’m into Dark Souls, Resident Evil, Timesplitters, and old Tony Hawk. Still down for Kirby or Mario Party with friends. I like board games that actually require some thought, like Betrayal at House on the Hill or HeroQuest. Other stuff I’m into: classic horror, building Gunpla kits, museums, occasional camping, and I’ve been slowly learning Japanese. I don’t drink, smoke, do drugs, or even bother with caffeine usually, not in a judgy way if you drink coffee (but in a judgy way of you smoke).

**What I’m Like:** Introverted at first but social once I’m comfortable. My humor’s usually dry, dark, or a little weird. People say I’m easy to talk to and usually pretty funny in person. I have a strong filter for quality, whether it’s people, ideas, or anything else in life. I don’t fake things and can come off as negative sometimes but that just amplifies the stuff I do like as genuine and not slop. I take relationships seriously. I’m not afraid of commitment, I just want it to be with the right person, someone I can actually build a life with. I’ll take care of the people I love. I’m reliable, loyal, and when I’m with someone, I’m all in.

**What I’m Looking For:** I want a serious relationship with someone who shares traditional values. Long-term, I want a dynamic where I provide and my partner takes care of the home and raises a family. If that sounds boring or outdated to you, we’re probably not a match. I’m looking for someone younger, ideally between 18 and 24, since I want a big family and the timeline matters. I’m most attracted to East Asian or white women with a slim or average build, obviously personality is king but we can’t deny that physical attraction matters. As such I’ve attached pics of me for you to judge.

**Dealbreakers:** tattoos, far-left politics, weed or drug use, heavy drinking, or being chronically online. If you’re into gaming, metal, horror, or nerd stuff, we’ll probably get along. I’m not expecting perfect. Just someone honest, loyal, and serious about building something real. You obviously don’t need to match me 100%, I’m open to trying new things (as long as I’m not doing substances) and hope you’re at least receptive to trying a board game or TCG.

Mostly texture but also flavor (bitter and spicy are the big ones). My family is full of people who don't have food issues. They drink black coffee, eat spicy food, change recipes, eat adventurously. The issue is they shame me for not liking what they like, because how they eat is culturally normal. I do eat a lot of carbs and sweets, but I also love vegetables (but only raw). I've been forced to eat thing I can't stand, despite gagging. I've developed a lot of food-related trauma and disordered eating because of this. There's a lot of shaming talk about and to me no matter what I eat now.

 The current issue is my mother swears I ate everything without complaint until I was 4, at which point I became a ""picky eater"" (hate that phrase). I know it's typical for tastes to change, especially in early childhood, but I also know that I've been lied to and gaslit about my lived experiences on a regular basis. I'm not convinced she's telling the truth or remembering accurately, and I don't remember because it was 35 years ago and I was literally a toddler.

I guess I'm looking for a sanity check, your experiences, any medical/developmental/academic resources, etc. Did any of you get more selective/restrictive/avoidant with foods when you were young?

1pnq0es,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrenchCrusade/comments/1pnq0es/backstory_for_my_how_warband_leader_a_little/,"Backstory for my HoW warband leader, a little Sultanate homebrew","Fatima ""Bint Jabir"" al-Nippur, Provost Emeritus of the Baghdad House of Wisdom College of Takwin Nippur Campus, scholar of the Order of Lapis Lazuli, master alchemist of the order of Solomon, blessed magi by the Sultan's blessed right hand, and author of ""The Enlightened Mind: Seals and Materials To Grant Wisdom to Takwin Homunculi"" lies in disgrace. 

Fatima was one of the House of Wisdom's most esteemed Alchemists, being the youngest woman in a century to earn the Damascus steel mask of an elite scholar. After three decades of teaching, research, and overseeing the creation of one of the Sultan's personal guard of Lions of Jabir, she decided to craft her masterwork: a Takwin buraq to guard the great Ishtar Gate. One with greater wisdom and grace than any other. 

After a year of endless toil, the death of three Kavass assistants, and the loss of her own left hand, she had completed her Masterwork. The winged behemoth was unlike any other, standing on two great feet and taking the form of human perfection, it's face that of a beautiful woman but with a great braided beard like the kings of the Jahilliyah. It was named ""Gilgamesh"" to honour the first hero. It wore great robes of alchemically hardened silk, and wielded a Zulfiqar greatsword the size of a minaret. 

Gilgamesh was wise, kind, and befriended those who knew it. Its booming voice was a great comfort to both hardened Yuzbasi and children alike. It was paraded throughout the Sultanate before being positioned as a guard, where it was said that the prayers it sang could be heard by warbands even after the wall disappeared beyond the horizon. It was a master work of the Takwin art, strong enough to cleave even the most terrifying creations of Gog and Magog in two in a single swing, while using its wits to predict oncoming attacks so perfectly it never received a single wound in all its battles. However, since the day of its creation, a steady stream of tears flowed from its lapis blue eyes endlessly. 

Fatima became a household name, and it is said she was even invited to drink tea with the Sultan and his family personally on several holy days. In alchemical circles, people spoke of Gilgamesh as proof that Fatima could create the rebis, and thus the philosophers stone. Her studies drove her to complete the creation of the true rebis, which would allow her to grant true immortality to those who battled in the Sultan's name. 

Her career came crashing to ruin on the 12th of August, 1913, at the feast of Eid al-Fitr. Gilgamesh was heard conferring with its fellow buraq, loudly proclaiming that next year it intended to participate in Ramadan. The Imam of the Babylon gate was quickly informed of the Homunculus's words, and he immediately left the feast appalled. He addressed the Takwin personally, standing atop a great turret of the iron wall to meet Gilgamesh at eye level. Enraged, he reminded the homunculus it had no soul and was a creation of the Alchemical arts, and not by Allah. Gilgamesh responded, soft spoken but loud enough it was heard by many in attendance 

""But my friend, my brother, great Sheikh, I feel the love of Allah, Subhanahu wa ta'ala, in my heart. I cry not for sadness or pity, but for exaltation. He has spoken to me in my dreams- for I too dream. He speaks of love, light, and how I am awaited in Jannah where he will give me a true, beautiful, name. I wish to serve the Sultan, Razi Allaho ta'ala anho, and live by the teachings of the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa salla, both in body and soul. I wish to live by Shahada, Salah, Zakat, Sawm, and if I may not participate in Hajj then I desire to experience Jihad al-akbar and Jihad al-Ashghar in the praise of Allah. I beg of you my brother, have we not spent many hours discussing the beauty of his divine teachings? Of the perfect world he hath given us? Of how blessed are we that we may battle the Zindiqs to defend that which we love? Or how we laughed for endless hours over the follies of men? Is that not proof that I share in his love, that I have an immortal soul same as you?"" 

It is said that Fatima awoke that night to an Assassin of Alamut in her bedchamber who haded her letter written in the Sultan's own hand, so hastily sent that it was not yet sealed. She was escorted to his palace by a guard of his Janissaries, though she knew the Assassin was watching her from the shadows should she make a single misstep. No one speaks of the fury in his whispered words in the throne room, as only he and Fatima know what transpired between the two of them, except for his final declaration: She had created a Takwin that spoke back to an Imam, and questioned the Sultan's own teachings directly.

Fatima's research volumes, notebooks, scrolls, and every copy of her books, were burned in alchemical fire. Every Takwin she had created, from the lion in the Sultan's guard to the singing fairy she had given to her baby niece, were burned alive. Finally, she received one last order from the sultan. She was to personally oversee the creation of a vast quantity of purified Greek fire- enough to burn Gilgamesh to ashes. It is said Fatima oversaw the operation like any other research project, her expression hidden behind the mask of her armour.

Fatima watched as Gilgamesh was burned for two days, first by barrages of flame cannons from the wall itself overseen by the Sapper Mimar al-din, then by a company of brazen bulls. Mimar considered Gilgamesh as one of his truest friends, and wept throughout. Never once did Gilgamesh stop singing prayers or crying, even as the sand at its knees turned to glass, until it was finally silenced by a final crushing blow by its fellow buraq. Its last words were ""thank you for the life thou has given me"". Fatima never asked if it was addressing her, or Allah. 

Fatima exiled herself before any order could be given. Joined only by her apprentice Maria Absaban, her former janissary Fāris Sab'a Wa Khumsūn- Alf Wa Thalathmi'a Wa Sittah, Mimar, and a small company of Kazass. As she exited the Ishtar Gates, she looked at the glass heap that was the final resting place of Gilgamesh, and vowed to return with knowledge to create the philosopher's stone. As she made camp for her first night beyond the blessed walls, a single lion of Jabir, Enkidu, approached the camp. It brought with it alchemical ammunition, alchemical fire, coffee aplenty, and a machine gun. It told Fatima it was ordered by the Caliphs of the House of Wisdom to protect her, that the House would provide what support it could, and that it had a message from them: 

""Find redemption, not death.""

Killing the BEV Lightning while the rest of the world keeps scaling EV adoption isn’t a strategy - it’s self-sabotage. Ford is literally swapping a battery-electric pickup for an EREV with a gas generator. Translation: when we get nervous, we bolt an engine back on and call ourselves “pragmatic.”

Meanwhile, the technology curve isn’t slowing down, it’s accelerating, and the center of gravity is moving to China. They’re rolling out megawatt-class fast charging, pushing charge times toward “coffee break” territory, and shipping well-equipped EVs at prices that would’ve sounded like satire five years ago. That’s not a press release… it’s scale, cost-down engineering, and relentless iteration. The kind of flywheel you don’t catch up to by clinging to yesterday’s fuel.

Here’s the part nobody wants to say out loud: the US is defenestrating its own industrial future to protect a petro-economy that’s already being outcompeted on physics and economics. Oil is an incredible energy source, for the 20th century.  Electrons are the 21st century logistics layer: generation, storage, software, and motors. We’re choosing to stall out because politics told us to be scared of change.

Yes, the US tech was moving too: range, charging, batteries, and cost-down manufacturing. But policy whiplash and culture-war signaling are turning that progress into a stop-start, investment-choking mess. You don’t build a new manufacturing platform on vibes and four-year election cycles.

The punchline is brutal: China will fill the vacuum; not just in cars, but in batteries, charging standards, supply chains, and manufacturing scale. That isn’t “green ideology.” It’s industrial reality. And once the ecosystem locks in, the US doesn’t just lose market share, we lose leverage.

We’re gambling one of the last big US manufacturing strongholds on short-term politics. Keep bludgeoning innovation, keep pretending gasoline is a moat, and don’t act surprised when the Big Three shrink into regional nostalgia brands in a world market they used to lead.",45,1765850781.0,F150Lightning,18,0.94,False

1pnpx5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/coastFIRE/comments/1pnpx5q/my_coastfi_story_43f_single/,My CoastFI story - 43F Single,"I’ve been in this group for a while and really enjoy reading everyone’s stories, so I figured I’d share mine. I’m using a secondary account for a bit more anonymity. I’m pretty active in my local ChooseFI group and have a fairly specific niche, so I might still be recognizable, but I decided it’s worth it if this helps or inspires someone.

I’ll start with the highlights, then rewind and fill in the details.

Hit CoastFI at 42 and redesigned my life around something I genuinely love. I work less, travel more, volunteer weekly, and I'm living my best life!

**Quick Stats**

* Currently 43, Female
* Single, no kids
* Low to medium cost of living city in the Midwest
* Hit CoastFI in August 2025
* Own several rental properties plus my primary home
* Started my own travel company focused on African safaris and small group safaris that I personally host

**The Numbers**

* $300k in taxable brokerage
* $325k in traditional 401k
* $15k in Roth IRA (just started last year)
* $40k in HYSA
* \~$550k in real estate equity across 5 doors

My plan is to sell two of the five doors in the next year or two, one of which is my current primary home. That would allow me to cash out roughly $300k of equity. After those sales, the remaining properties should still cash flow around $1k per month, though I’m not currently counting that as income for the sake of this post.

My current cost of living averages about $2,500 per month, which I’ve been tracking closely since August. After selling my primary, I plan to move into one side of my duplex and house hack, which should bring that number down even further.

**Life After CoastFI**

Honestly, it has been amazing!!! I wake up without an alarm. I drink my coffee slowly and check emails and the news. I create new posts and engage with social media content, which is technically my job now, but it doesn’t feel like work. I usually spend a few focused hours on emails, calls with safari clients, and building itineraries. I would say I work about 15-20 hours a week. Hard to tell though because it seriously doesn't feel like work...

I take my dog on long walks. I volunteer weekly at a local food pantry and absolutely love it. I just signed up to walk dogs at the local shelter and plan to foster a pregnant mama dog so she has a safe place to have her puppies.

I’ve also been downsizing intentionally. Selling things on eBay and local Facebook groups has been oddly freeing.

This year I have two extended safari trips planned and will be in Africa for about a month each time. That is something I could never have done in my previous career. I feel absolutely giddy about it!

Financially, my goal is to earn around $35k per year. I also have enough savings to give myself some flexibility, especially heading into 2026.

**My soapbox moment :)**

I want to be clear that for me, creating a niche safari travel company is not just a random CoastFI job. It is a huge passion for me. I’ve been on many African safaris, and for me.... watching someone experience their first safari is one of the best feelings in the whole world!!!

I see a lot of posts here that ask, “I hit my number but now what?” or the infamous 'one more year' syndrome. So I just wanted to post my story and hope it gives someone a fresh look at what is possible. I mean, it's not like a safari company called me and offered me this life. I built it intentionally. CoastFI gave me the space to focus on what I actually love, not just what pays the bills. Should you quit your job and start a niche safari company? Probably not, but whatever the equivalent is to you - definitely DO THAT!!!

I know I'm missing so many details - like the fact that I graduated college with over $120k in debt, and only started saving (and first opened my brokerage account) in 2020. I feel like that would be a whole separate post about how I actually got here. But I'm happy to answer any questions! But please be nice!!!!!",18,1765850660.0,coastFIRE,9,0.88,False

This apartment is in a fantastic location in Midtown West/Hell's Kitchen, between 8th and 9th Ave & W. 47th St. We've really enjoyed living here, but are moving and are looking for a lease takeover!



\*Rent $4850/month 

\*Move-in date 2/1/2026 (some flexibility for earlier). 

\*Current lease renews 7/1/2026. However, landlord would likely prioritize applicants who would sign a 13 month lease beginning February 2026. 

\*True 2 bedroom, with space for a king bed in one and a queen in the second. 

\*Living room with deco fireplace and brick mantle. 

\*Tons of windows and multiple exposures

\*Location is amazing. Close to everything, the building is right by a cute gift shop and a coffee shop. Loads of bars/restaurants/cafes, and a Whole Foods a five min walk away. 

\*Transit: CE is <5 min walk away, A (6 min walk away), NRW (6 min walk away). Very conveniently located.

\*Up two flights of stairs

\*We did significant preemptive pest control when we moved in and have experienced zero issues. 

\*No laundry but there's a laundromat within 1 minute away, and LL is looking into installing W/D in the basement.

Best things 

Seeing characters everywhere (Meeting Winnie and Donald Duck)

Photopass (we didn't pay for it, but heavily enjoyed the novelty of getting our picture taken lol)

Remy milkshake

Cheeseburger spring rolls 

Eating at the Polynesian 



Biggest trip regrets 

Not riding frozen or tower of terror

Getting kids meals

Not immediately moving away from screaming kids when it was possible



Consensus on some things

The heat sucks in Florida, even in November

Everything was bigger than I thought besides the world showcase, they should find a way to expand that, it was very hard to move around

Buses were way more convenient than I imagined 

Meeting characters was way more fun than I imagined 

Everyone is sick.

Everyone is hot.

The water is honestly fine

1pnpqeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1pnpqeh/help_with_career_advice/,Help with career advice,"I want to serve the Lord and minister to His people, and I really care about making an impact with the work I'm doing as we spend so much time in our occupations throughout our lives. Causes like poverty and disease in developing countries, as well as the mental health of the young people of this generation really speak to me. However, I know that if I had the resources and the time with a more stable, high-paying job, I might be able to find time to pour into these causes through donations and mission work. 



I'm currently a first year college student and I'm absolutely stuck on what to do, as I'm currently in Information Systems with an initial desire to do consulting work as I love building relationships and connecting with new people, and many people have informed me that I am good at being social and connecting well within big groups as well as one-on-one interactions. However, even though I feel that I can catch on to technical things more quickly, like math and coding, in comparison to literature or English, I really disliked my Calc 3 and programming classes this semester. I often catch myself dreaming about writing a Christian book or creating a Christ-centered app or website to help people better live out their calling for the Lord, or even being a speaker or coach with my own business. But I don't think that I am that good of a public speaker (which I would be willing to devote time to, but the ""talent"" may not be there) and English classes were typically my most difficult subject. But the joy of writing a paper that I'm proud of is far more satisfying and energizing to me than successfully completing a bunch of math problems, although the latter is typically done with higher quality. I was also raised in a household where mathematics were much more highly emphasized than writing and English, as my dad would push me into math tutoring from a young age but didn't blink an eye at English comprehension or grammar skills. But I know a lot of the jobs involved in ministry and social work unfortunately may not pay enough to sustain myself and my future family, which could potentially lead to burnout. 



I've also been fascinated by health and the idea of community planning or helping create programs to create a healthier society through nutrition, or writing plans for new community initiatives to better the wellbeing of our community. I think the main reason I decided to take up business and IS was because I also considered using the skills I learn to transfer it to start my own nonprofit or potentially give financial advising for Christian clients and organizations. I really liked my interior design class in the past as well, and have even considered becoming that. But a lot of these jobs tend to be not as stable, well-paying, or ""future/AI-takeover-proof"". I feel like I've gone circles and circles thinking about every possible ""meet in the middle"" compromise, like being an HR consultant/manager, operations/management consulting, marketing, IO psychology, dietetics, etc. but I don't know if I can stand the cutthroat corporate or healthcare culture as I've noticed I am a bit easily influenced by my environment since coming to college, and being in a more competitive college has sometimes caused me to value the success, influence, and power that the world offers and turns my mind to worldly thinking. I am scared that I will lose myself and turn into another cog in the machine of a corporate cycle, but obviously that comes with benefits like stability, benefits, etc. but that could honestly be 'gaining the world but losing my own soul'. But then I might have the time and ""stability"" to pursue other things as side hustles. But then I might have no work-life balance especially at the beginning of my career, which might lead to early burnout and no energy or time to do anything else. I'm so sorry I overthink quite a bit! 



But I find myself in a bit of a pickle—I'm usually good at the things I don't want to do, and I don't want to waste my talents and resources that my parents have poured into me. I know I might sound like I put a lot of hope into my career and no job or career should ever go to my identity, but I also feel that if I'm in a job I enjoy combined with working hard and being financially stable (Lord-willing) I will have more energy to be a light for Christ and give back to my community and family, financially and energetically. But I know a lot of career advice given on here emphasize focusing on the talents we've been given, and I don't want to be selfish and waste what I'm good at. Would anyone have any advice or wisdom on what majors/career paths I should pursue, or suggest any I haven't considered already? Or any actions I could consider taking moving forward?



I pray a lot to God about it and have talked to multiple close friends and mentors but I just get more confused and indecisive, as I feel like I don't get a definitive answer. I've went on coffee chats with people in some of the aforementioned fields/careers but I don't know what I might like best. My parents also only see futures in accounting, finance, consulting, operations, computer science, AI, or being a doctor/nurse. I am grateful that they care about my financial independence in the future which has led to me also not wanting to worry them in a low-paying job or ""low-prospect"" major, but sometimes that concern drives the wheel more than doing what I might actually want/what would bring me joy.

I work as a barista/waitress at a family owner/retired couple coffee shop (they do food too which is amazing). 

Lately, they’ve been very negative and it’s really putting the employees down. They treat us not very good and I am certain the husband of the couple has issues with me but I don’t specifically know what. He just complains I’m slow. I do everything the same speed as everyone else. 

It’s just making this job harder for me. I actually don’t want to go to work tomorrow because I don’t like the environment. It’s them. When they aren’t there, it’s so much lighter and calm, even when it gets super busy. It’s fun. 

I love the job and what I do. I work well with my fellow employees well too. The owners are negative and don’t treat employees well—i mean they’ve talked to customers about us in front of us negatively. They don’t back us at all with customers. They really believe the motto of “the customer is always right”. They’re not and they’ve lost money because of it. That’s what I do since that’s what’s happened multiple times and we are told not to argue with the customer. 

Anyway, they’ve become more negative (than usual) to work with and thinking of binding their behavior to reflect back on them and stop. What do you think?",2,1765850113.0,witchcraft,4,1.0,False

But if I keep the flame low, it takes forever. 20 minutes and nothing happens. If I put it higher, the coffee tastes kinda burnt. 

Am I missing something strategically? How can I know when the balance is just right? I have a heating plate to put over the stove I figure might balance things out a bit better.

I  am reflecting on a theme I think is at play in a friendship.

Recently I have decided a somewhat new friendship (2 years) is no longer worth investing in. This is someone I met at work and we have a lot of things in common and shared philosophies. Occasionally we have met up outside of work, but more typically make time for each other during coffee/ lunch breaks etc.

I have noticed this person relies on me for favours and information but yet seldomly is it reciprocated. There is always an excuse or outright forgetting to fulfill their end of the deal. Personally it may look like always being late when we agree to meet, or doing a favour for them in exchange for something they will do for me - think swapping skills , if you do this for me I will do that for you but then doesn’t follow through.

And then from a more tactical position it is this over reliance on me to fulfill something they need. For example messaging me to ask where information is or let so and so know they will be late. They have the same access to people and directories that I do yet for some reason I am their go to. I have put a stop to this mostly by delaying my responses or flat out ignoring the request, but they still do try.

When I have drawn attention to it the response is always one of regret and then saying how important the friendship is to them, yet nothing has changed.

Other than a level of disrespect that is happening, I am feeling this person doesn’t see me as their equal and instead I am useful to them but maybe from a hierarchical point of view. When my other good friend asks me why I keep attracting people like this, I am drawing a blank.

Do you think equality in a friendship also means there is a balance of power? One should not hold a position over the other even if it is subconsciously implied? I have friendships that are so easy and joyous and then I have ones like these where there is an emotional drain. Over my history I tend to have had more of the latter.",9,1765849988.0,AskWomenOver50,20,1.0,False

Here were the problematic findings:

\-JOINT SPACE: There is a trace joint effusion. No Baker cyst. No intra-articular

bodies. There is a cyst anterior to the lateral meniscus and intercondylar

notch, measuring 2.5 x 0.8 x 0.9 cm.

\-OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No fracture or osteonecrosis. No stress reaction. No

worrisome focal lesion or infiltrative process of the marrow spaces. There is a

hypoplastic medial trochlea, consistent with Dejour type C dysplasia.

\-IMPRESSION: Large cyst of the anterolateral joint, which may reflect a ganglion or para meniscal cyst, but consistent with old injury.

I know my next steps are to search for a specialist who can give me more information about next steps and healing.  Would any orthopedic that specializes in knees work?  What should I look for in an orthopedic or other specialist that could help me?

I went from training to a marathon to not able to run at all.

I struggle with these types of situations due to a lifetime of being an autistic kid always doing the ""wrong"" thing without realizing, even though I am extremely good at masking and reading social cues now.

I was working somewhere for a while (for reference, it was a ""fun"" workplace that was kind of anything goes), and there was a guy I thought was cute& had compatible interests but he briefly mentioned his ""girl"" once 3 months ago so I didn't pay much attention to him, figuring he was taken. Multiple times he seemed upset about being a young single dad and all I ever heard about his kid was how much he didn't want to be a parent. One day a few months in, he started to pay extra attention to me, saying my name a lot, leaning in close to the side of my face like there was something on it, getting me water, etc. He started frequently saying he wanted to be my friend, asking why I was so quiet, telling me I was intelligent, teasing me, etc, it sounds annoying but I didn't mind it. I didn't consider that he was flirting and did not react much.

Then one day I was sad about something, and he came up behind me and one-handedly massaged my shoulder for a full 2 minutes while telling me it would be okay and such; this was in front of another coworker. I kind of just froze, on principle I was like ""why would you rub a coworker's shoulders like this"" but in practice it kind of turned me on, because I did find him attractive. Then on my way out a few minutes later, he came up to me nervously with his phone open to contacts like he'd been waiting for the moment I walked past, and asked if I wanted to put my number in ""because he wanted to be friends"", and said ""call me later we can talk about this""; it was already 9pm. I put my number in and left, I had no clue how to feel about the interaction.

The next morning I got fired for unrelated reasons (lol). I texted him that I got fired, and he said ""I was intelligent and capable"" and that the firing was unfair, and the last thing he said was ""the good news is anyone you still want to be friends with here will still be friends with you..."". I was feeling pretty wounded about getting fired, so I latched onto the attention. I asked if he wanted to get coffee or whatever in a friendly tone, and he still hasn't opened the text a week later.

I texted coworker 2 who I was friendly with ""hey, I think \[coworker1\] is into me, what's your advice on this?"" and was told he has a committed girlfriend and that he just likes making friends. I felt really stupid for thinking he was interested in me, and felt embarrassed for revealing this to coworker 2, because now my mind is going to ""the reason CW1 hasn't texted you is because CW2 told him& he's creeped out that you even considered that he was hitting on you"". I viewed his public snap story absently because it was recommended as a contact and then all of his stuff got set to private within the hour which made me feel like a weird crazy stalker, even though it was public & I wasn't even searching for it.

TL;DR My gut feeling tells me this guy was flirting with me, because if I had a committed gf, I would not be touching girls at work/asking for their numbers/asking them to call me late at night/etc, but I'm getting really down on myself & feel like I did something wrong, and like everyone I left behind at work is talking about me. I'm sad about getting fired & this potential connection has become a big deal in my head, especially as I have been trying to get over a breakup. Advice welcome.",1,1765849303.0,ghosting,0,1.0,False

I enjoyed the conversation, we made lots of strong eye contact during, and she was asking me tons of personal questions about me and my life etc.

After that whenever I would see her in this shared public space, she would always come to me directly and keep starting more similar conversations, sit by me, etc.

Eventually I asked for her number and she gave it to me. After that we started frequently coordinating schedules to meet at the place to hang out and do the activity there together as a team, with a group of friends there etc.

There have been multiple times where she has texted me late at night around 11:30pm to ask me when I would be around so we could play together and one time, I was going out of town for the weekend and she texted me at 11:45pm to say “Have a fun trip! Let me know when you get back so we can get some games in together.”

She’s a very social extroverted bubbly person in general and I am exactly the opposite.

During this time we were frequently meeting up but mostly in a group context. Her friend there would frequently manufacture situations for the two of us to hang out in the shared space together.

Anyway, what I’m getting at here is there were A LOT of signals that this girl was into me - probably more than I have ever had from a girl in the past.

Last week she texted me again at midnight and asked if I could go play with her on Monday at 2pm - which I couldn’t unfortunately, but then she rescheduled right then and there for that Wednesday at 11:30.

So we met up Wednesday and had a great time. Tons of chemistry - something which a lot of the regulars at this place have noticed (they started asking me where she was when I was there by myself, and at least 3 different friends there asked me directly if we were dating).

So I knew she was going away for 5 days this past Friday on a ski trip with her family.

I texted her around 10:45pm and said “Hope you have an amazing trip! Want to grab coffee and tell me about it when you get back?”

ALSO she told me she would show me pictures etc when she got back just a few days prior.

She didn’t respond that night or the next day, but on the following day, she “liked” my message and said nothing else lol.

Truly a wild situation with everything else during the past month getting to know each other, coordinating schedules, flirting in person etc.

My plan right now is to not say anything and just see if she re engages once she’s back from her trip.

A little frustrating because I was looking for some real clarity and I feel like she did the least clear thing imaginable lol.

Scary how in 1.5 years one can have thousands in the bank saved, a new nice apartment, full time employed etc. Then having to sell stuff I worked hard for, lost respect from friends and family, lost my former larger nice apartment, everything fine then start from scratch through medical mistakes and workplace trauma they got away with and I was exhausted to push harder through legal means. Lawyer said take 2 months off to focus on health. Luckily lawyer free as work in the wrong. Go figure.

I am in no way fit in any respect to work even casually. That’s how bad I am medically. Autumn (April) earliest I could return part time. And it’s good money. 

Anyway, just want some advice. I know people have had it worse and lost more and rebuilt and restarted. And my debt seems like nothing compared to others and what they’ve lost. 

Probably my first “taste” of loosing it all almost and digging myself out. Step by step. Day by day.",0,1765849057.0,AusFinance,2,0.29,False

My colleague is a super introverted Brazilian Guy from porto alegre. He joined our group almost one year ago, and he is around 34-35, single, has ex-girlfriend. I think we were good friend because we always join some other colleague's party, event, volleyball game. I was kind of flirting with him by holding his shoulder, arm and always chat with him, talking about movies, Brazilian culture etc. Recently we have a super deep coffee chat about the famous Uruguay band, he recommended me a Brazilian band and I let him recommend some music, he firstly said he is glad to have coffee chat with me. Then he asked if I want to watch the secret agent with him in WhatsApp, he always tends to plan everything in advance and be punctual. So I said yes I am glad to watch it. Later on he asked me if I want to grab for a beer at which Bar at what time with him on Saturday night, because it is quite sudden, I already in a party So I said sorry I couldn't, Then I asked if he is alone? He told me no he had a new guy friend who wants to know the city and he thought I could be a good person to chat. Later on I asked maybe Saturday night 9pm we could go together 1-1 to grab for a beer or some in Christmas market, he said yes he will in, Then he arrived even early than the time, along the Christmas market, he asked me if I am here during Christmas, I said yes, he seems like super happy and say oh I am also here. And he requested two hot wine, kept the cup as a souvenir. Since then, everytime in the office I said I get a coffee break, he will go with me, chat with me even not drink coffee. Looks like he really likes to chat with me. I told him I am looking forward to the movie night, he also replied Yes! Me too! Then I am confused because Both of us are guy, I couldn't tell if he likes me or treat me as a friend because he is so introverted, always refuse body touch and always polite, not so typical Brazilian, so it is hard to tell what does he mean? By the way he likes lady gaga, he had ex-girlfriend, he is also into Girl, but he also asked if I will stay here during Christmas seems like he wants to spend Christmas with me? Also 1-1 movie night at movie theater, 1-1 Christmas market drinking 2 rounds hot wine, coffee break in the office if I messaged him even he didn't want to drink he will immediately come. Also sometimes I am kind of using some emojis like 😉，❤️to chat…I don't know if it's sensitive in Brazil, so please help me to analysis it.

Pilot Guild training center OutReach station Cayston territory outer rim asteroid belt.

Titus Staples had been traveling three days alone in a rattling ' Kestrel ' shuttle, the only passenger aboard the aging courier vessel bound for the Pilot Guild Training Center.

The facility—a converted heavy hauler over six hundred years old, more than two and a half kilometers long, one kilometer wide, and three-quarters of a kilometer high—drifted like a silent city amid the outer asteroid belt, still within Principality space but far beyond the comfort of inhabited worlds.

Suddenly the comm system crackled to life. A crisp, aristocratic voice filled the cockpit. “Guild Training Center Outreach Station. State your name and business.”

“Winston Titus Staples, reporting for pilot training, sir.”

The officer paused, scanning the file. “That’s ‘my lord’ to you, commoner.”

Titus clenched his jaw, thinking, Another entitled blueblood—even out here. Wonder whose feathers he ruffled to get stuck on comm duty.

“I’m sending coordinates for Bay 32. Dock there and follow the blue line to Administration.”

The shuttle settled with a gentle thud. Titus thanked the automated pilot, then checked with the flight crew about storing his Kestrel Racer—a sleek, older-model four-seater he’d restored himself. “She’ll be safe in Hangar Auxiliary,” the deckhand grunted. “Admin office? Two minutes. Follow the blue line.”

The corridor smelled of coolant and recycled air. Painted stripes guided him past humming bulkheads and drifting asteroids visible through occasional viewports. At the marked door he straightened his jacket and stepped inside.

Behind the desk sat Administrator Hale: late fifties, sharp as a plasma cutter. Buzz-cut hair iron-gray at the temples, obsidian eyes that missed nothing. His slate uniform matched the crew’s, but gold-glowing patches marked rank. Scarred hands rested on the console; the faint scent of coffee and ozone hung around him.

Hale glanced up, noting the small duffel. “Saw your Kestrel MK4 on approach. Old but well-kept. You’re Winston Staples.”

“Yes, sir. But everyone calls me Titus.”

Hale grunted approval. “Fair enough. Let’s get you checked in. Your assigned instructor is Edward Russell—mean son of a bitch, but the best there is. Have a seat. He’ll be here shortly.”

Ten minutes dragged by under harsh overhead lights. The door hissed open. Edward Russell strode in: sixty years old, two meters tall, slim build, chiseled face weathered by decades in cockpits, silver threading through close-cropped hair. He offered no smile, only a curt nod.

“Staples. Let’s move.”

Titus rose, pulse quickening. The real training—and whatever lay ahead in the black beyond the viewports—was about to begin.

Edward led Titus—no, Winston, but he’d already decided nobody was using that—down corridors painted the same institutional gray as every academy ever built. After eight turns and one broken lift they reached the cabins. Door slid aside. Edward pressed a data chit into his palm. Map, money, comms—everything you’ll need. Food’s two decks up, portside, meals only here '  Titus taking the chit ' is a food chit for that .

Comms hub’s in your pad; family calls come out of salary, but Principality mail’s free but takes 4-6 weeks as gets  screened —cargo haulers leave every morning. Write them. Talk later let you get settled . He paused, almost smiled. Don’t get lost. And left. Titus exhaled. The room was coffin-tight—bed, desk, shower stall, toilet wedged between them like afterthoughts. He unpacked fast, set Mum’s photo on the shelf. Then he tapped the pad: family line rang six times. Mum? Her voice crackled through light-years. Titus—are you breathing? He laughed. Yes. Just arrived. Good. Now listen— the bill popped up onscreen: ninety credits. He winced. I’ll write tomorrow, he said. Love you. Click. Silence. He opened the letter template instead. Dear Mum, I’m alive. Room smells like bleach. Miss you. He sent it off. The Principality hauler would carry it six weeks. Plenty of time to learn why Edward walked like a man who’d trained pilots who’d died.",2,1765848514.0,OpenHFY,1,1.0,False

1pnp3cr,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1pnp3cr/looking_to_gain_some_perspective_from_people_who/,Looking to gain some perspective from people who have dated multiple people over time.,"
I met my ex when I was 16, we divorced after she cheated when I was 30, and I am 33 now. Kids stayed with me full time, they are 12 & 13 now. 

I am on dating apps, but I haven’t been on a date since we divorced, I have attended therapy and it helps to talk things out. 

What I’d like to ask about is how do you feel about types? Like opposites attract or similar interests? For example my ex was into reality TV, horses, decor, coffee, county music, etc. and  I am into Video games, anime, computers, rap/rock music etc. so very different but we still liked each other and had good years together before it all fell apart. 

This leaves me really confused as to what I should look for in a new partner. When I think of what an ideal partner would be like, I come up with something like:

A woman who is into similar things like anime, video games, computers, gym, swimming, etc. who would have hobbies like drawing or singing, who is interested in cosplay, who smokes weed, and has some type of good moral compass. 

That sounds like a made up dream person, but I feel like maybe I feel that way because I’ve only been with someone who was very different from me. 

I’m open to dating a woman even if she’s not anything like what I described, as long as she cared about me and took interest in some of my stuff I’d do the same for her. 

I feel like I’m really attracted to faces. If someone’s face doesn’t give me like a butterfly feeling then it’s hard to imagine myself with them. I’m not saying it has to be super perfect or anything, it’s just that I feel like body types are a dime a dozen but people’s faces are so unique that when one stands out to me it’s just a real solid feeling of attraction.

I’ve never wanted to go home after one day of vacation. It honestly feels trashy here. I’m stuck for a week so I’ll update if things get better. 

Good:

\- SERVICE - Most everyone is polite and friendly. 

\- Lazy river fun but very short. 

\- Beach is beautiful, no seaweed.

\- BEDS - I have to say I slept so well and VERY comfortable. 

\- MIKE’s COFFEE - I really loved the coffee here, the sweets were good as well. 

BAD

\- DRIVER - We used Costco travel and I’ve never been so scared being transported to a resort. It was the scariest drive I’ve ever been on. 

\- ROOM - I don’t want to say super bad? Just rundown and not super good. For a resort as new as this it feels 20 yrs old. Very cheaply built. Nothing super clean. 

\- NO PRIVACY - Maid entered our room even with do not disturb sign! Don’t be fooled by the fake deadbolt… pops right open. 

\- DRUGS- My adult children have been offered drugs 3x. 

\- LOUD. No relaxing on your patio with obnoxious music going on all day long until late at night. I mean it’s obnoxiously loud giving me a headache everywhere we go. 

\- BEACH VENDORS- while the beach is beautiful cannot relax on beach chairs because you are approached constantly by beach vendors who won’t leave. Literally hit on my daughter and sat down with us, persistent and unwanted. We left because they wouldn’t leave us alone. 5 total people and very pushy.

\- FLOATIES - we left 5 floaties with a lifeguard to air up, were tipping him. He said, “come back in 10.” My husband came back and watched him sell 2 of them to random people who tipped him! We had to demand them back! This was at the side of the lazy river.

\- BUFFET - we liked a few things there, just scared because a lot of things don’t seem chilled that should be and stuff laid out that should be heated but isn’t. 

\- ALCOHOL - sooooooo watered down. My adult children did 7 shots and weren’t even buzzed.

\- ICE - NO ice makers on the property. We walked to the lobby 2x to ask for ice and finally received it almost 2 hours later. This wasn’t an ice bucket, they were 2 - small 16 oz containers. 

\- REFRIGERATOR - doesn’t keep things cold.",3,1765847950.0,AllInclusiveResorts,6,0.62,False
