Advice on routines to help

I was an athlete in college (6 months ago) and was in really good shape. For the past 10 years,  I’ve generally never had a super strict diet and if anything needed to eat more. Now I have a job where I’m in remote locations on a 10/4 schedule so I don’t really have the ability to cook because I’m in a hotel, and during the 10 days I’m working outside 10-12 hours. I am usually exhausted afterwards and it’s causing me to be lazy with quick food options and not working out. I have gone from working out 2-3 hours almost every day to maybe 1 hr once or twice a week on work weeks, ( everyday on my breaks). End result: 20+lbs weight gained and feeling helpless. Typical diet is breakfast sandwich/coffee for breakfast, chicken wrap or chicken salad sandwich for lunch and then a takeout meal for dinner, like Panda Express or local restaurant. Sometimes I’ll snack too much after, but I have been limiting that to fruits/veggies to promote a change. 

I’m aware it’s mostly my diet and work schedule that’s caused me to lose shape so quickly. I’m definitely applying to new jobs. In the meantime, what are dietary options for someone like me who lacks a kitchen for dinner and limited to cooler based breakfast/lunch options? I would love to reverse this trend and get back to my confident self, but it’s so hard to get the energy to keep at it. I can’t tell if I’m just making excuses or being clueless, but obviously I’m at a last resort hence the post.

**My [25f] boyfriend [26m] of 10 months is best friends with his ex [20s?f]. She refuses to meet me and it's getting weird** 

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/LqKCVoTfKc)  **July 11, 2017** 

I started dating my boyfriend, Jeff, 10 months ago. This relationship has been amazing so far and I definitely see a future with him. There's just one problem: he has a weird relationship with his ex that's starting to make me really uncomfortable and suspicious. 

When we started dating, he often talked about his best friend, Jenna, who he also owns a business with. He made it pretty clear that she was an important person to him. I knew they had spent vacations together and he mentioned hanging out with her parents a few times, too. 

A few weeks after I met him, I creeped through all his pictures on facebook (because who doesn't do that with someone they just started dating?) and saw a bunch of very couple-y pictures of him and Jenna. I also found her instagram and looked through it, and it's FILLED with pictures of Jeff. A bunch of them had the hashtag #relationshipgoals and other similar things. So in this way, I figured out that they had dated. I kept waiting for him to tell me that himself, but he never did. About two months after we started dating, I straight-up asked him if he had dated her, and he admitted it. 

He said that they had met in school and had similar ideals and ambitions. They dated for 9 months and broke up a year and a half ago. I asked him why they'd broken up, and he said their relationship was awful and they worked much better as friends. They started their business after they broke up and things have, apparently, been going well between them since then. 

I started to get kind of suspicious about her, though, when time passed and I still hadn't met her. I met his friends and family pretty soon after we started dating, but I didn't meet Jenna. I went to numerous social events that I'd expect her to be at, but she was never there. There were a number of occasions when our paths ALMOST crossed and I really thought I was going to meet her, but I never did. For example, I went to their office a few times to meet Jeff after work, and Jenna was already gone. Or sometimes I'd come to meet him and he'd come outside to meet me so I wouldn't have to go inside. 

Things started to get REALLY weird about three months ago. Jeff and Jenna were having an open house night one evening. Jeff came over to my place after work and we had a few hours to kill before it was time to go, so we went out for dinner and then walked to the office. I was kind of expecting that I'd come in and help them set up, but when we were a block away, he started asking me if I had lots of work to do and saying there was a really nice coffee shop nearby. He actually walked me to the coffee shop and sat me down, then left to go get ready with Jenna. He told me to come to the office in an hour and a half. 


About half an hour before I left for the office, I texted Jeff and said I hoped everything was going well and asked if there was anything I could do. He replied and said, ""Something's come up for Jenna and she can't be here tonight."" 

I was getting really suspicious at this point. I went to the office half an hour later and sure enough, Jenna wasn't there. People kept asking about her ALL night and Jeff told them she'd had a family emergency. 

When we walked back to the car later that night, he told me what happened. While he and Jenna were getting ready, she had had a panic attack and said she was scared to meet me. She said she wouldn't be able to handle it and either had to leave, or he had to tell me not to come. He told her to leave, so she did. 

Since then, a couple more weird things have happened, and I still haven't met Jenna. Once, when I was hanging out with Jeff, we went to the office so he could grab something. When we were almost there, he looked at his phone and said, ""Jenna's still there. Let's just go for a walk."" So we walked around the block for half an hour and then came back when she was gone. 

After that happened, I told Jeff I felt really uncomfortable with the situation. I could respect that they were friends who had dated, but the way she was acting about me was very suspicious. He apologized and said he had actually been really mad at her, but wasn't sure what to do. He also told me a couple other weird stories about things she'd done. He went to a party a few weeks ago (I didn't go) and his phone had died that night. When he got home and charged his phone, it was full of texts from Jenna saying she was outside in her car and asking if I was there or not. She actually never even ended up going to the party, simply because SHE DIDN'T KNOW IF I WAS THERE OR NOT.


Now here's the kicker: Jeff and Jenna are currently on a two-week-long camping trip. They've been planning this trip since before I met him, but considering the way she's behaved, I feel very uncomfortable about him being on this trip. I just looked at her instagram and she's posted five new pictures of him. As awesome as Jeff is, I'm really fed up with this and I'm seriously considering breaking things off when he gets back. Am I being unreasonable?


  ---   
tl;dr: My boyfriend is best friends/business partners with his ex. She has done a number of weird things to avoid meeting me and I'm so sick of it that I'm considering breaking up with him. 

**RELEVANT COMMENTS** 

**Glitterland** 

>You're not being unreasonable at all, and I can understand why you feel so upset about the whole situation. If I were you, I'd be asking Jeff a few questions: does he know the root issue of why she doesn't want to meet you? Is she like this with anyone else? 

>Explain to him that the situation is upsetting you and that you aren't comfortable with him going on a two week vacation with her. She is, afterall, his ex girlfriend and the whole thing strikes me as a little strange. Maybe you could talk about meeting Jenna with Jeff present in a quieter, mutual place like a cafe or a restuarant. 

>If Jeff was my boyfriend I'd be looking for answers. Best of luck to you and please post an update! 

**OOP** 

>>It's kind of reassuring to hear that other people don't think I'm being unreasonable. I have actually asked him if he knows why she's being like this, and he says he's asked her the same thing and hasn't gotten a clear answer. He said he's asked her if she still has feelings for him and she said no. 

>>They're actually already on their trip, so there's not much I can do about it at this point. I think I'll try probing him a bit more when he gets back and see if he might know a bit more than he's telling me about her behaviour. 

**Jilltro** 

>>>You're not only not being unreasonable but you have put up with wayyy more than most other people would have. I would have noped out of there when I found her Instagram and realized he didn't tell you that he had dated her. Not to mention all the crazy over the top nonsense she's pulled since. And he is going on a two week long trip with this girl? Oh god, so much nope. 

**OOP** 

>>>>Well, I'm glad that at least I'm not the only one who thinks it's weird! I kind of feel like I probably would have called it off already if he wasn't so great in other ways. This is seriously the best relationship I've ever had, but the whole Jenna situation is REALLY over the top. 

**Why wasn't OOP on the camping trip or why wasn't it canceled** 

>I have to work and I was never invited. 

>As far as why it wasn't cancelled: good question. 

**[deleted]** 

>>I just broke up with my ex last week because of similar behavior. Her ex was super clingy and openly in love with her and she wanted to stay friends with him. 

>>Found out they're going on a vacation together and I straight up wasn't invited. Confronted her about it and she refused to accept that it was totally fucked up behavior. So I dumped her. 

>>Confront your boyfriend about this when he gets back. Don't tell him he can't be friends with her. Just tell him how it makes you feel. And if he gets defensive or tries to gaslight you, dump his ass. Don't let your SO treat you like shit because they're overly protective of an ex. This girl is very clearly still obsessed with your boyfriend, and her intentions cannot be platonic. Maybe your boyfriend is just a dumb idiot and needs to open his eyes. Or maybe you're just second fiddle in his life 

**OOP** 

>>>Wow, that sounds kind of creepily similar to my situation. I'm sorry to hear about your ex! Sounds like you're better off without her. 

>>>I have decided to confront him when he gets back. I really need to tell him how all of this makes me feel. I've told him it makes me uncomfortable before, but I guess I haven't said exactly HOW uncomfortable it makes me. And I'm starting to feel like this camping trip is just unacceptable (partially thanks to all the people that have commented here!) and I shouldn't have to put up with stuff like this



[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/S2CaC7Gshq)  **Oct 9, 2018 (15 Months later)** 

I wrote my previous post over a year ago, and a lot has happened since then. I wanted to give everyone an update, since the advice on this sub was really helpful at the time. 

For a few months after I wrote my OP, nothing much happened. Jeff and I continued dating, and he continued being friends/partners with Jenna. I never met her, but everything else in our relationship seemed to be going so well that I decided I'd try to deal with it. 

Things got really hard, however, when I had to take a work contract 12 hours away from home for three months. I hardly saw Jeff the whole time, and I looked at Jenna's instagram almost every day to see if she'd posted more photos of them together. More often than not, she had. Since I wasn't physically present, I felt like Jenna was his real girlfriend. I felt completely worthless and constantly stressed out, knowing my boyfriend was spending all his time with another woman who I already had suspicions about. 

While I was away for work, I decided to break up with Jeff. I broke up with as soon as I came back, and I made it very clear that his relationship with Jenna was intolerable for me. I told him he was going to have a hard time dating anyone who wasn't her as long as she was still in his life. He kept saying he didn't understand why it was such a problem. He told me he couldn't control her behaviour, but he promised me he hadn't cheated on me. I explained to him that by allowing their friendship to continue, he was condoning her behaviour. I told him I didn't really even care if he'd physically cheated or not, since he'd already shown disrespect for me and our relationship. 


I didn't speak to him for a few months and I went on with my life. I took another contract out of town and even considered moving permanently to another city. One night, though, Jeff called me and apologized. He said he had been thinking about our relationship a lot and realized he had been in the wrong. He said his relationship with Jenna was beginning to feel toxic to him, and he'd made arrangements to dissolve their business partnership. After that, I decided to meet up with him (not necessarily give him another chance) and discuss the situation further. When we met up, he promised to stop talking to Jenna and unfollowed her on all social media.


As of now, he has not spoken to her in six months, and we've gotten back together. We actually ran into her at a concert a few weeks ago, and they didn't even say hi to each other. I feel much more respected and confident in my relationship now. 

TLDR: I broke up with my boyfriend. He ended his friendship/partnership with his ex and we have gotten back together.

Here it is- 
Book Idea/Concept + Multidimensional Work. 

Name ideas - The Other Side/The Transition/Between The Lines/The Ripple. 
Dates and chapter titles subject to change. 

THE BEGINNING 
It was December 1st, 2000. The beginning of a gruesome month. The air was crisp, almost too painfully sharp to inhale. But by her side, I remained. This time in death. Not like the days before, standing in her embrace. Feeling her fingers comb through my hair as she dusted the unkempt strands from my eyelashes. Not like the weeks before, sitting side by side in the car, glancing over at her smooth rosie cheeks as she belted the lyrics to Kiss Me by Sixpence None The Richer. This time, my body laid over her headstone like a frozen blanket thrown over a clothes-line in the middle of a thick snowfall. I could almost smell her perfume in the frozen dirt, or was I clinging too hard to the idea that I could bring her back with the wails of my heart and the agony of my inner-most deepest core.
January 2nd, 1992. Our wedding day. It repeated in my mind like a rolodex spinning violently with no force to halt it. Her eyes locked onto mine, her words tugging at my heart strings. Her lips stained red from the wine toasted to good luck upon the moments ahead. I can’t help but to picture her as angelic as she was on that world-shifting day. At first, my brain was silent. Excruciatingly still. The noise is now overwhelming with grief and reverberating in the forefront of my mind. Any time before, the storm
could be calmed with a gentle brush of her hand down my cheek. The rain would cease, the thunder would cave to the command of silence. But I was here, alone in my distress. Elsewhere, I believed her soul transcended. I was often served disgruntled glares and unsolicited advice to better my mental state for mentioning it. Was I losing it? Was I grieving wrong? How far off could I be, to still feel so close to her as if fingertips away. It had been just hours shy of eight days. Eight days of denial. Eight days of anger. Eight days of bargaining. Eight days of depression. Eight days of dismissing breakfast, microwave dinners, empty bed sheets, and an unwavering refusal of acceptance.
It is now 11:50pm. In 10 minutes, eight days will have passed without a seismic collision, though my world is falling apart so devastatingly on its axis. The clock ticks, the hands move exhaustingly from counting down the very milliseconds until my inevitable break. I am growing tired and weary of waiting. For what, I’ve yet to know. The anxiety crept up my spine sending lightning bolts through my chest and leaving trails of tears puddled in the suprasternal notch of my neck in its wake. All I could think about is how cold her chair feels beneath my naked body. How her blanket feels as though somebody has torn holes in its perfect patterns and once comforting fabric, when we’d used to cling to each other beneath it, reclined back, completely unbothered by the cold before. These days I float through time on a series of ‘used to’s.’ My eyes begin to droop, my head starts to fall. I feel my limbs growing heavy as I succumb to the yearning of my body crying out for rest. Will I finally fall sleep before the sun kisses the horizon? 

THE WAKENING 
What’s that sound? My senses feel overwhelmingly heightened. That smell, it is familiar but unsettling. Did I leave the stove on? My eyes peel open as the crusts of my tears form circles around the baggage beneath them from the sleepless nights before. When did we get an alarm clock? We’d once lived our daily life with the idea that the universe would bring hints to us, telling us exactly what we’d be doing and where we’d need to be. Every morning started with hot coffee, a book, and our warm naked bodies pressed against each other, legs curled around the other, but never an object as blunt and demanding as an alarm.

Where am I? Did I drunkenly stumble into an unsuspecting families home? But I hadn’t had a drop of alcohol since she’d passed, I’d thought to myself. Too many times I’d reached for the bottle of red wine sitting exactly where she’d left it from our last cooked meal together; only to kiss my fingertips and place them firmly on the label as if she could feel my touch from wherever her soul lingers, if anywhere at all. The room is bright, the curtains are pulled back exposing unrelenting sunlight blazing beams into every corner of our bedroom. For the first time in eight days, I’ve felt warmth. It is in this moment I realize that I am laying in our bed. Completely naked, vulnerable, and barely underneath her blanket that felt ripped and too light for comfort the evening before. Suddenly, I hear her voice from the kitchen so softly and comfortingly singing Kiss Me, by Sixpence None The Richer.

1g0a6jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/coldbrew/comments/1g0a6jf/toddy_brewer_lid/,Toddy Brewer Lid,"I'm keen on getting a Toddy Brewer for cold brew, the 'domestic' 2 liter one, but I'm finding one thing about them a little strange: some listings for the product show it to have a silicon lid over the brewing bucket part, and others show it without and don't list it as included. (eg: [https://toddycafe.com/product/toddy-cold-brew-system](https://toddycafe.com/product/toddy-cold-brew-system) vs [https://alternativebrewing.com.au/products/toddy-cold-brewing-system-for-coffee-tea](https://alternativebrewing.com.au/products/toddy-cold-brewing-system-for-coffee-tea) )

This is bizarre to me because I don't think of that part as optional by any stretch. Without it, you'd have to cover it with cling wrap while brewing, which would be so needlessly annoying. 

Can anyone shed light on this? Has anyone purchased a Toddy Brewer and it had no lid?",1,1728532024.0,coldbrew,1,1.0,False
1g0a6aw,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1g0a6aw/im_starting_to_believe_that_you_have_to_fake_it/,I'm starting to believe that you have to fake it till you make it in this job market,"Honest people do not make it in this world anymore. I'm starting to realize in order to eat, I might have to completely fabricate and lie on my resume and portfolio about my work experience but make believable and verifiable lies such as buying domain links and setting up a website as a front to make these fake companies believable as work experience, I know people who can be references if required, because entry level jobs basically do not exist anymore and these employers want you to be Mark Zuckerberg for their company. You do not want to have too much skills or experience or too little, just the exact amount that the job description says. If it says you need experience with PowerBI and Microsoft Excel but you legitimately never used them because you have been using Tableau and Google Sheets, that will be used against you because Alyssa at HR doesn't know they're similar enough and will say you do not qualify for the job. So you best be having every single thing the job description has on your resume and no alternatives because these people do not know the difference.

These jobs all want you to have 5 years of work experience for a 12 dollar an hour web dev CRUD job just to end up rewriting the company website's ancient API routes to update their forum page that a monkey can do... And I didn't go to college just to work at JCPenney and fold clothes for 5+ years with no chance of a promotion or a future at this store, JCPenney might not even exist in the next 2 years. That's the definition of a dead end job. I'll be back to square one if I stop actively looking and applying for jobs.

How are we supposed to get work experience if these employers are not willing to hire without it? A bachelors degree use to be the minimum qualification. Now it's 5 years of work experience plus a masters degree. Don't tell me it's a wish list, these companies are treating it as if it's mandatory because all the other job applicants have what Carrie and Alyssa at HR is looking for. Claiming it's a wish list shows you're not aware of what these employers is expecting us to have. Just go on Linkedin and see for yourself.

The pay isn’t even worth it most of the time. They want you to have mastered full stack development, cloud infrastructure like AWS S3, Google cloud oauth playground, API integration, know the ins and outs of Nextjs as if you created it, all for 12 dollars an hour in an unaffordable country. 1 dozen egg cost 5 dollars here where I live, a gallon of milk is 4, and a bag of 4 bagels is 3. That's 1 hour of working at these stupid jobs. I do not have enough money to even buy food for the week, I have to use my parents money. You're lucky to even get 8 hours, they'll put you to 1 hour under full time on a shift 39 hours a week so you'll be classed as part time so they don't have to pay you health insurance

I’m sick of seeing job listings that make it seem like you're applying for a doctor job when it’s just some underpaid, overworked contract maintaining their outdated ancient systems, or folding clothes at JCPenney with no advancements or promotions possible.

They’re looking for unicorns on a McDonald's budget and it’s making me go bald. I'm starting to think the only way to even get an interview these days is to fake it till I make it, aka lying on my resume and in interviews if I happen to be lucky to even get one lie through my teeth to the interviewer because it's what they want to hear even as I squirm through the chair because I'm uncomfortable with lying, and that shouldn’t be the reality for any of us trying to start our life. People my age are just jumping off the porch and coming into ""the real world"" and this is what we are introduced with.

These jobs acting like they want ""innovative"" and ""passionate"" people, but what they really want is a cog in their endless machine who’s already done the exact job before, for years, with no training required just so they can pay them a slave wage. They’re fishing for the perfect candidate while completely ignoring the reality of what’s happening out here.

And don't get me started on these college professors I had to deal with last year talking about how these group projects are to prepare us for ""the real world"", when these professors never even had a job outside of this college, their professor role was their first and only job they ever had right after they graduated college 20 years ago so you can't possibly tell me what it's like in the real world when they never even been in the real world in the first place. This college has been their only planet they been to.

I get these jobs need to be selective, but there’s a difference between hiring smart and being flat out delusional cheapskates. They want you to have 5+ years of experience in stuff that didn’t even exist five years ago, just to manage their janky ass database that some motherfucker hacked up a ""solution"" with by storing it in god damn Trello, yes I saw job posts listed Trello as a fucking database.

I’m seriously wondering if anyone's actually getting these jobs because we heard of ghost jobs before where the jobs are being posted but has no intentions of hiring because it's to make investors think the business is growing. How is this not straight up fraud is beyond me. Or if it's all just some ridiculous test of patience to see how long you can jump through hoops before you give up like these jobs with 7 rounds of ridiculous interviews. We're not applying to be doctors, we're applying to work on stupid company websites that no one cares about and has zero sensitive information that a monkey can legit do. Meanwhile, bills are still coming, and if I see one more listing that is listed as ""junior developers"" but requires ""senior-level"" qualification requirements like a Masters degree just to get an interview, I might just lose it.

Not even Walmart or TJ Maxx and Nordstrom is hiring. You think I didn't apply to these retail jobs? My job application at Fedex delivery has been in ""under consideration"" since April. I literally cannot apply to any other jobs at Fedex because that one and only job post they have in my area is indefinitely open and I don't know who to speak to. The managers at one of these offices have no clue because they're not the ones hiring, they're just the manager of the store. I applied to fucking Tim Hortons near my area and got a text message from the hiring manager saying they're not hiring in my area anymore, but there is one hiring 2 hours away, wtf is the point?? Who the fuck will drive 2 hours for a 12 dollars an hour 4 hour shift coffee shop job? I went through the Target one way video interview and still didn't get the job, a fucking cart pusher job.

And all of these retail jobs that are legitimately hiring are only hiring managers and assistant managers but want you to have a minimum of 5 years of experience in retail management. But the only way to get these retail management interviews is to lie on your resume because these people only hire their own cliques.

At this point, the job market feels more like a scam than an opportunity. It’s not about who you know or how hard you have worked anymore, it’s about playing the game, and right now the rules are stacked against anyone who is honest on their resume and interviews. You cannot be honest in interviews anymore because there are other job applicants who will lie by saying they have more experience and skills than you, and guess what they got the job because you were too honest and didn't lie in the interview. Honest people don't make it anymore.",4,1728531999.0,jobs,1,1.0,False

Do not blow your nose too hard or cough too hard, as that may actually aggravate any infected tissue, that needs to heal.  Avoid dairy products, as they are mucous forming.  Avoid all meats, as they require much blood sugar to digest - and your body actually needs that blood sugar to heal; however chicken noodle soup is recommended daily.  In fact, **chicken noodle soup**, simmering for 10 minutes, with a couple cloves of diced fresh garlic, some fresh ground pepper, some sliced carrots, and about a quarter inch of diced fresh ginger root (if available) - cooled with ice cubes when served, and with some nice crackers - will tend to break any fever.  It is important to use ice cubes when serving boiling hot soup, so that it doesn't SCALD the mouth or throat, and in doing so, leave an opening for the bacteria to get a stronghold while you have a weakened immune system.  It is important to avoid sugary foods, as they can accelerate bacteria growth and infection in the throat (- restaurant soup is normally served around 160 degrees Fahrenheit).  It is important to avoid coffee, tea and chocolate (- however herbal tea is fine) - because caffeine depletes vitamin C and dehydrates.  Snacking on citrus fruits and vegetables is a very good idea - of course apples and bananas are fine as well.  An over the counter decongestant for daytime and another for nighttime use is important if you are stuffed up; and of course, you are responsible for reading ALL the directions on all your medication.  Using skin moisturizer around the nose will help prevent a rash from facial tissue usage.  Low sugar cough lozenges, and sore throat lozenges are necessary - especially if your symptoms are making it impossible to get to sleep.  In North America ""Fisherman's Friend"" menthol lozenges take the itch out of the throat quickly.  Know that if green mucous appears for more than a week, or if you have any other ""SEVERE"" symptoms, you will need to bring that to the attention of a medical doctor. (December 14, 2017 update)                                                             When ""under the weather"", it is good to know what the ""SUPER FOODS"" are.  It doesn't hurt to have two glasses of grapefruit juice, daily - as grapefruit juice is highly acidic and is full of enzymes (- of course if it is from concentrate, many of the enzymes are lost).  It is good to have fresh oranges and orange juice throughout the day - and it is even better when mixed with ginger ale.  Fresh, ripe and sweet mangos are full of vitamins.  Fresh sweet pineapple is a good source of vitamin C as well.  Know that the wasabi and ginger root slices that come with sushi, are highly medicinal and both fight virus symptoms.  Red curry paste, that is available in asian stores, is highly medicinal  - when diluted with water and served as a heated sauce made with coconut milk and crushed unsalted peanuts (- best to check some recipes for the right combination of ingredients; best served with basmati rice).  Hot sauces like Tabasco and cayenne pepper based sauces, are very important for vasodilation, as they serve to open blood vessels, and in doing so allow for healing elements in the blood - like white blood cells for example, to reach swollen tissues (- Tabasco is great in chicken noodle soup).  It is important to note that aspirin, a blood thinner, helps the blood flow better through infected and swollen tissues, in order to speed healing as well.  It is best to only consume small amounts of spicy foods, so as not to upset the stomach - and only if they are something your system is already used to.  Of course there are many other ""super foods"", when under the weather, but in our part of the world, these are the ones that we rely on the most, and the ones with the best immediate results. (December 19, 2017 update) ",1,1728531693.0,u_lazarusbethany12345,0,1.0,False
1g0a1nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g0a1nd/my_wifes_obsession_is_scaring_me/,My wife's obsession is scaring me ,"Everything was completely normal until last year. We had what felt like a totally typical marriage. I remember the night things started to get weird because it was right after our 5th wedding anniversary. 



It was a regular day working at the bank when I got a text from my wife. A text from her in the middle of the day was not unusual, but what the text said was definitely not like my wife. 



“Hey babe, I had an idea for something new we could try when you get home;)”



Now, don't get me wrong, I was thrilled to get this text in the middle of my workday. I think any man would be ecstatic at a text like that, but I was having a hard time getting too excited because something about it felt so off. My wife has never been the kind of woman to send a message like this, let alone want to ‘try something new’. She is a very shy and to herself woman. 



The day moved at a snail's pace as I anticipated what my wife had in store for me. I tried not to overhype it in my head. I prepared myself to find a baked good or something when I walked into the house. I fully believed she didn't mean to send a winky face. 



Not to say I would have been disappointed with whatever she had in store,  I'm not much of a wild guy myself, but a little spice never hurt anyone…right? 



When I pulled into the driveway I was surprised to see most of the house lights were off. I suspiciously unlocked the front door to see my beautiful wife standing facing away from me in the doorway to the bedroom. My happiness from seeing her quickly grew into confusion when she didn’t turn around to look at me when I walked in and said her name. She would normally run up to me and give me a big hug. In the past, my wife has always been the sweetest person I've ever known. For her to not run up and give me a hug and a kiss was strange. 



I made my way inside after waiting a second. Trying to be as loud as possible in the hopes she would suddenly notice I was home and look at me. I got closer and noticed she wasn't moving other than her soft breaths. 



I was standing right behind her and tapped her on the shoulder.



“Hey, sweetheart. Um, are you okay?” right as I got out my words she jumped around to face me with a giggle and smile.



“Ha! That was so funny! Did I scare you?” She said while covering her mouth in an attempt to hide her toothy laugh. 



“Yeah, I guess you really did scare me,” I replied with a nervous chuckle. “So was that your special surprise you talked about?”

“Of course not silly! That was just the beginning of the fun.” She remarked with a smirk and a wink.



She grabbed my hand and led me into our bedroom. Under normal circumstances, I would have been over the moon about it, but her scaring me just before leading me into the bedroom felt so off-putting. Did she think this would turn me on somehow? Did one of my buddies reach out to her and tell her to do this? All I knew was that I was not interested in whatever romantic endeavors my wife had planned. I never thought I would say that.



As we got to the bed, she pulled back all the covers and told me to lie down. I honestly felt like telling her I had a headache or something, but it was clear she had been thinking about this all day and I really didn't want to discourage my wife from initiating things in the future. 



My mind was spinning with thoughts of what she might do next but she did something I didn't expect. She put the covers back over me and tucked me in. I was both relieved and more confused than ever. She gave me a soft smile then in one fast motion fell to the ground like a sack of wet hammers. I intuitively sat up and leaned over the side of the bed to make sure she was okay and was only met with the ends of her long brown hair peeking out from the bottom of the bed. 



“Hey Katlyn, why are you hiding? Can you please come out? I’m not a fan of this game you are playing.” I murmured in a tone trying to not sound freaked out. I was only met with the sound of a muffled giggle. 



I sat in bed for the next 10 minutes trying to tell her to stop. It went from polite asking to begging, but the laughter didn't stop. After my begging didn't seem to work, I got the courage to get out of bed and look beneath me. As soon as I put my foot down she grabbed my ankle. 



“What the hell Katlyn! This isn't funny. You have fun here, I'm sleeping on the couch.” I slammed the bedroom door behind me and curled up on the living room couch. I could still hear her laughing from the joke I seemed to miss. 



It was so hard to sleep that night. The image of her hair barely peeking out from under the mattress really stuck in my head for some reason. It took a while but I finally fell asleep. 



The next morning I was up for work a couple hours before her so we didn't get the chance to talk. I had to go into the bedroom to get my clothes for work so I peeked under the bed to check on her. She was sleeping peacefully on her stomach and I tried not to wake her. 



It was a long hard day at work. I wasn't really feeling all that scared anymore, more so worried for my wife. I wasn't sure how I could help. 



Around 10am I got a text from her.



“Hey Emmett…I'm really sorry about last night. I have a lot of explaining to do once we both get home. Can we talk over some pizza?” 



I felt so much better after reading those words. It might seem insignificant, but my wife hates pizza so whenever she is willing to eat it with me I know she is putting in the effort. 



It was the end of the day and I headed home looking forward to some pizza and some time with my hopefully back-to-normal wife. 



I walked through the door and was relieved to see my wife setting the table and putting down a pizza box. She heard the door shut and ran to give me a hug and a kiss. I really felt like I had my wife back.



“I'm so glad you are home. Sit down, sit down, I got pizza from your favorite place down the road.” She said as she pulled a chair out for me to sit down.



We were both quiet for a minute or two after we both sat down. I don't think either one of us knew how to start the conversation. Just as I was about to speak up, she started to talk. 



“So I know last night was weird. I just got really insecure after hearing a few of my coworkers talk about the things they do with their partners and I was worried you thought I was too boring. I know I can be shy and don't like to do anything crazy and started to feel guilty for not doing more with you. I wasn't entirely sure how to even go about it or what you would like so I just went for it. I understand now how I went wrong. I'm sorry I just don't know how to do this kind of thing” She said as if she had rehearsed it many times in her head.



“Why would you ever think I was bored of you? I don't need any of that wild stuff. I married you for a reason. You don't need to try to be something you're not. I love you for who you are.” I said as I grabbed her hand. She took a deep breath and looked at me with watery eyes.



“I love you too, thank you for being so understanding. I really want to make it up to you.”



“That's very kind, but the pizza is enough for me.”



“No, I'm really serious. I did some more research and found a few good ideas.” She said as she put her hand on my thigh.



I was so torn at that moment. I was terrified from the night before, but it seemed like she learned from her mistakes. Sure, it was an incredibly strange mistake to think scaring me would get me in the mood, but she is extremely sheltered. That's what I was trying to tell myself. I knew deep down something was still wrong and I should just say no, but I think many people can understand how your body can go on audo pilot in moments like this. At this point, nothing was going to stop me and I'd give every excuse in the book as to why it was okay to let her do her thing. 

Just like last time I was led to our bed. She made me lay down and immediately put my hands over my head into handcuffs and put a blindfold on me. My heart was racing at this point. I was terrified but human nature was taking over and it could not be overridden. 



Right as she put the blindfold on me, she stepped back and I didn't hear her move. I was expecting her to do something to me, but nothing…



I laid on the bed feeling more exposed than I ever felt possible. After a couple minutes, I heard the floor squeak and it confirmed that she had been standing right by the bed the whole time. I felt like I could feel her eyes staring at me. It was practically burning a hole in my skin. I heard the light switch flick off. Now I really couldn't see anything. 



After a few moments of anticipation, I felt her fingertips graze the sheets near my sides. Then by my feet, just barely missing any part of my body. I started to maybe get hope again that I shouldn't be scared. Sure, this wasn't what I had in mind, but she was new to this. I was very wrong. That was the last moment I had hope for my wife. This was teasing. This was torture.



I was soon met with the sound of her scraping her fingernails against the walls like a wild animal. She moved around the room scratching anything she could find, along with a brief giggle here and there. It was like she was silently moving from corner to corner. I would hear her make the awful scraping then it would stop for a second. Then I would be jumpscared by her doing the same thing in a different spot.



It made my skin crawl like I had a million little bugs crawling on the inside of my skin. I wiggled violently, trying to get out of the restraints or to get the blindfold off, but I was trapped. 



It kept getting worse as the night went on. She kept getting right by my ear. Sometimes she would just breathe and other times she would let out a giggle. She would run her hands closer and closer to my body, sending me into a cold sweat. 



I of course didn't have a way of telling the time, but I would guess it was about an hour in when I stopped begging her to let me go and I just started yelling for help. I guess she didn't like that because she put duct tape over my mouth. 



Shortly after that, I started to hear the scraping sound on the ceiling. Our bedroom has an extremely high ceiling so I had a hard time imagining how she was doing it. 



I couldn't believe the situation I was in. It felt like a terrible nightmare. I kept thinking any minute I would wake up next to my gorgeous wife sleeping soundly beside me, but the nightmare lived on. My wrists felt raw and bloodied. My neck was sore from moving it back and forth trying to get the blindfold off. My whole body ached from trying to free myself, but all that paled in comparison to the psychological torture my wife was putting me through. Not being able to see her next move and not knowing how far she was going to go killed me inside. 



Before I knew it I was waking up the next day. Still tied up and blindfolded like the night before, but I didn't hear my wife around. I didn't let my guard down, however. I knew she could just be waiting for me to relax then jump out and scare me again. 



After wiggling my head around for a bit, I finally got the blindfold off. I was honestly scared to open my eyes. I was terrified that my wife would be standing in the corner waiting for me to look at her. Luckily, when I opened my eyes she was nowhere to be found, but the relief was brief after seeing the aftermath of my bedroom. Nearly every square inch was scratched. Even on the 20-foot ceiling above my head. Some of the scratches even had blood in them. 



As I looked around at my ruined room, I heard my phone buzzing on the bedside table. Either I put it there before getting into bed or my wife put it there. At this point, it didn't matter, but having my phone near me could be a saving grace. I figured it was my boss calling me since it was 10am and I wasn't at work. I wasn't sure if my wife had any plans of coming back to get me, but maybe if I didn't show up to work my boss would get worried about me and come looking for me. I soon had the realization that if they called my emergency contact it would just be my wife and I wasn't sure how helpful she'd be at this point.  



I laid down in my bed the rest of the day. Miserable as I watched the hours go by. My stomach growling and my arms were sore from them being above my head for the last 24 hours. 



It was around 9pm when my phone started getting calls like crazy. I remembered I had plans to get dinner with my brother and he was probably worried about me. I am not the kind of person to just bail. After a couple hours of calling, I heard a few knocks at the door followed by my brother's voice. It was muffled but I could tell he was worried. I heard keys start to wiggly in the doorway. He had a set of keys in case I lost my pair and needed to get in the house. 



He opened the door and yelled out my name as I tried to be as loud as possible. Thrashing my body around as I tried to scream out the duct tape that was nearly off my face. 



“Emmett? What the hell dude?” My brother yelled and he ran to my aid. He immediately ripped the duct tape off my face. 



“Oh my gosh, thank goodness you are here, get me out, now!”



“Damn dude, I didn't think you and Katlyn were down bad like that. Nice!” My brother said with a smirk 



“Danial, this is not the time. Get me out!” I said with more aggression.



“Okay, okay. Hang on.” He murmured as he tried to get the cuffs off. 



After trying for a while, we found it impossible to get them off without a key. He ended up just getting my bolt cutters and cut them off. 



It was nearly midnight when I was finally out. My arms were so sore it took me forever just to get them back down at my sides. 



“So uh, do you want me to pretend I didn't see any of this or something?” Danial said in a casual tone.



“What? No, no, It's not what it looks like. Trust me. I wish it was what it looks like. Katlyn is sick or something. She trapped me here all night and practically tortured me.”



“Look, I know we are close and all, but I don't think I need those kinds of details from my own brother.” He remarked with a chuckle. 



“You aren't listening to me. Look at the walls and the ceiling. She did this. She is scaring me. I don't know what to do.” He looked around the room and then at the ripped-apart ceiling. Not fully grasping the situation but clearly concerned. 



“Okay, come stay with me tonight if you are freaked out.” He said half annoyed and half worried.



I grabbed a few pairs of clothes out of the closet and shoved them in a bag. I wasn't sure how long I was going to be gone but I wanted to be prepared. 



My brother only lives a few minutes down the road so It was an easy drive. The whole time I was worried my wife was going to appear and scare me. 



We made it inside my brother's house and he apologized for not having a guest bed. He's in his early 20s and lives alone so he doesn't have much space, but honestly, I didn't want to be far away from him. I didn't dare to tell my little brother I needed him and I was scared, but I think he could tell I wasn't okay. 



“Listen, I don't really get what is going on but it's getting really late and we both should sleep. Let me know if you need anything.” He said as he awkwardly walked into his room 10 feet away from the couch I was lying on. 



I had a terrible time falling asleep that night. Whenever I closed my eyes, I just heard the sounds of her nails scraping the walls in my head. I kept thinking, and I felt her warm breath agents my ear. I'd open up my eyes to find the room empty. It was starting to feel like the anticipation of her was becoming just as bad as her actually torturing me. 



I woke up the next morning exhausted. My whole body felt like I was just in a car accident from being so tense for so long, and I only got 3 hours of sleep. I realized that if life was still normal, my wife would make me hot tea and a warm bath with all her fancy essential oils that probably do nothing, but she always puts so much love into it.   



I started to feel myself slip. I felt sadness creeping in, but none of that mattered, I had to go to work.  I couldn't have a no-call no-show and then call out of work the next day. I would feel terrible about it. Plus I wanted to apologize to my boss in person. 



The work day started out strange when I tried to ask forgiveness from my boss but he acted strange at my apology. He explained that my wife gave him a call and said I wasn't feeling well and I would be absent from work that day. I guess despite everything, my wife still didn't want me to get a slap on the wrist at work. 



That was only the beginning of the strange day. I found a dead rat in my desk drawer, spiders in my locker, and a huge clump of hair in my lunch. 



It seemed like I was the only employee being harassed, but they ended up closing and sending everyone home at around 3pm because a few higher-ups got nervous and thought they needed to look into it. Banks tend to take stuff like this seriously. 



I went out to my car to leave for the day and was in shock to find a note on my car. 



“Did that do it for ya? ;) -Katlyn” 



I knew it was her. I just didn’t want to believe it. 



The last thing in the world I wanted to do was talk to the woman. I was terrified at this point, but I had to beg her to stop. For some reason, she thought I had some weird kink for being scared. Or maybe she developed one? Regardless, I had to tell her if it didn’t stop I was going to leave her. Or even get a restraining order. 



I didn’t want to meet her in person by myself. I didn’t know what stunt she would try and pull to convince me to give her one more chance. 



Since my brother was already partly up to date on the situation, I asked him if he would be there for our meeting. It might be awkward, but I needed him. I didn’t want to involve more people than necessary. 



I texted them both individually and told them to meet me at a coffee shop that night.



It was 7pm and my brother was already sitting next to me waiting for my wife to walk in. 



As she walked in it was clear she was putting on an act. She looked overly sad and was dressed in bright clothes that she’d never worn in the past. Trying to make herself look innocent. 



She pulled out a chair and sat down at our table. The air was thick and awkward. 



“Katlyn, I wanted to meet in person and have Danial here because I need you to know whatever you are pulling here isn’t what I want. I’m not enjoying whatever act you are putting on. I’m not turned on, I don’t find it sexy, whatever you want to call it, please stop. If this is something you are into, I think we need to talk to a professional, because it’s scaring me.” I said earnestly as her eyes got watery and Danial slouched in his chair uncomfortably. 



“I…I don’t don’t know what to say, babe. I have to say I’m confused. I know I’m new to this experimenting thing, but I’m doing my best. This is what you asked of me. I’m just trying to be a good wife. You know me, I’m as vanilla as they come. You are the one who asked me about these acts. I’m just doing my best.” She stressed as she fought back tears. 



Danial looked at me with confused eyes. 



“Wait, hang on. What’s going on? I didn’t think you asked for any of this, Emmett.” Danial said



“I didn’t! I swear! I have no idea what she is talking about. I would never ask anything like that from her.” I pleaded to my brother. 



“You are sick, you know that? Why are you doing this to me!” She uttered as she pulled out an envelope and tossed it on the table. 



Danial and I looked at each other before he reached for it and opened it up. 



Inside was a letter that Danial read out loud:



“Dear Katlyn, I love you with all my heart, but I’m afraid I’m getting bored of the same old same old. I want something more. I am writing this out as I might feel weird saying it face to face, but I’ve been thinking about it, and, well. Nothing gives me a high quite like when I am scared. And I mean, truly terrified. The adrenaline rush is like nothing else. I think if we employ this into our lives it would really spice things up. In the every day and in the bedroom. I hope you understand and don’t get put off by this, but I really, really want it. Under no circumstance if I say stop should you stop. If I tell you I’m too scared, you know you are doing something right. I can’t wait to see what you come up with;) -Emmett”  



He lowered the note to look at me. Only finding shock on my face. 



“What the hell dude? Why would you do this to your wife? And get me involved? This is so messed up and gross. Don’t get me involved in your sick kinks ever again.” He said as he threw the note at me and stormed out of the coffee shop. I begged him not to leave, but he didn’t even turn around. 



I sat and stared at my wife. Terrified. 



“What on earth is going on here? You and I both know I didn’t write that garbage.” I angrily whispered to her. 



Her face slowly morphed from sad to a satisfied grin. 



“Stop it! Stop it! I don’t like this. Why don’t you realize I hate what you are doing.” I cried. 



“When will you realize everything isn’t always about you? Maybe I’m the one who likes it.” She said as she lifted her eyebrows. 



“Stop, you are scaring me!” I begged 



“Good, then it’s working.” She said as she pushed her chair back and stood up. 



She turned around and looked like she was going to leave. Just as she was about to open the door she stopped. She turned back around and looked at me. She slowly walked back toward me and picked up the note my brother threw. She grinned at me smugly as I trembled in fear. She leaned down to my ear and whispered,



“I guess I did a good job imitating your handwriting, huh?” She said as I remained frozen in my seat. 



I watched as she walked out, got in her car, and left. Not knowing what to do next. 



She turned my own brother against me. This wasn’t a miscommunication or something, she was doing this on purpose. She was torturing me. But why? It couldn’t be just because she was bored of everyday life. Something was wrong. 



I knew my brother wouldn’t want me back at his place. He saw what looked to be proof of me being a nasty scum bag. I wouldn’t be able to convince him otherwise. I went to a hotel for the night. I didn’t have other options. I didn’t want to burden anyone else with this. Plus, I figured she’d just turn them against me too, 



After what felt like the longest day of my life, I was in my hotel bed trying to relax. I got a text from my boss letting me know they had to close the bank for the next couple of days because they were doing an investigation. I felt some relief from this. At least I didn’t have to worry about work for a day or two. 



I don’t remember much of that night, but I do remember the outcome of the early morning. I remember feeling cold and wet. I opened my eyes to see I was in the woods and lying in a very shallow grave. Most of my body was above ground with a small pile of dirt on top of me. I was frozen in fear. The fear of my wife lurking around somewhere. It seemed like she tried to bury me alive but did a half-assed job.



 I tried looking around at the dark forest to try and get my bearings but only found more confusion and dread.



The cold morning wind whistling around me added to my looming fear. As if it was taunting me, but it didn’t scare me nearly as badly as my wife. I looked around for her to try and find her but only got more and more worried when I didn’t see her. I heard the sound of twigs snapping from every side. 



Eventually, I heard a grinding clicking sound. It sounded robotic but also human. Then it turned into a giggle. I never thought the sound of my wife’s giggle would haunt me so feverishly. The sound would come from far to the right, then switch to my left. Faster than she would've been able to get that far. Much like she did in our bedroom a couple nights back.



I started to hear footsteps along with the twigs breaking. I swore it didn’t sound like she was walking on two feet but on all fours. I tried not to think about it. I told myself my mind was playing tricks on me. I shook my head back and forth in an attempt to shake the visions out of my head. 



I found the strength in me to get to my feet and to run. I noticed what looked like the right direction to move in, based on the ground being disturbed. Like she dragged me through the dirt to the spot I woke up in.



After running for a few minutes, the trail looked familiar. I knew I was close to home.  



When I would hear the footsteps I would turn my head to look, only to barely miss her. After what felt like forever, I saw her. She was on all fours circling me. Running like a wild animal. Her tongue sticking out of her mouth like a dog, I hardly recognized her. 



Her circles around me got tighter and tighter. As she got closer to me she slowed down. Eventually, she got right in front of me and stood up on her two legs. I tried to run around her, but before I knew it she pinned me down.  



I could barely recognize her up until this point, but something clicked when she got close to me. I looked into her eyes, but I didn't see my wife. I saw something else. I guess I should've guessed sooner, but something was wrong with my wife. Because this thing wasn't my wife.



“What did you do with her?” I yelled in her face. 



“You will never find her.” She whispered with a hoarse voice. As droll started to come out of her mouth.



She abruptly jumped off of me and scurried back into the woods. 



The last words she said echoed in my head ‘You will never find her.’ The relief I felt knowing my wife might still be out there, but how was I supposed to find her?





I couldn't keep up the running my whole way home, but managed a sprint. I kept thinking she was gone then I would hear her nearby. Taunting me. 

I got back to our house. I hadn't been there since this all started happening a couple days ago so I was scared to see what the inside looked like. I knew I couldn't stay for long, I saw her car still in the driveway so I planned to take it. My car was still at my hotel, but I needed to make it hard for her to get around. I thought I would also look for clues for my real wife while I was there. 



After I entered the house I was shocked to see the state it was in. My wife would rather die than see her home look like this. Glass broken on the ground from wine glasses, dirt, and trash in random piles, a foul stench filling my nose. I couldn't believe what that thing did to our once beautiful home. 



The horrible smell distracted me, but I remembered my goal once I saw some blood. I followed it to the basement staircase. I grabbed the fire poker by our fireplace and walked to the door leading to the basement. 



I felt guilty for taking so long and not just heroically running down the steps to hopefully see my wife, but my whole being was so full of dread I couldn't help but feel fear. I knew I had to fight, but every part of my body wanted to flee. 



The door creaked as I pushed it open. It was hard to tell if it was louder than normal or if the moment made it feel excruciating. I peered through the door to see more blood on the stairs. A lot of blood. I ran down as fast as I could without slipping, noticing blood on the guardrails as I tried to grab them.



As I made it to the bottom of the steps, I was in shock. I saw my wife.



She laid on the cold unfinished basement floor. Her breath was visible but faint. Covered head to toe in cuts and scrapes. I ran to her and collapsed beside her. Weeping like a baby. 



“Katlyn, Katlyn, please get up. Come on, we need to get you out of here. You need help, and I don't want her to find us!” I said with a panicked breath.



“Wh-what's going on? Was I sleeping down here? Wow, my head hurts.” She whispered in a groggy voice. 



“No time for that now, I'm getting you some help.” I proclaimed as I lifted her up in my arms with a sudden burst of adrenaline.  



 It was clear from her injuries she needed medical attention, but I wasn't worried for her life. There is no way the amount of blood I saw in the house was all from her, if it was all hers, she'd be on the verge of death. That awful creature must've gotten some blood somewhere else to scare me more. As if the sight of my wife on the floor was grisly enough. 



We rushed to the hospital in what felt like record time. As I carried her in, the hospital staff approached us asking all kinds of questions. I tried my best to explain, but it didn’t sound right coming out of my mouth. I couldn't explain any of it because I was still trying to understand it myself.



The staff got my wife set up in a hospital bed. She had an IV for some fluids and some stitches here and there. After a couple hours, she seemed to perk up, but she could tell I wasn't being myself just yet. 



“Babe, I know you are freaked out, but don't be so cold to me. I just went through something awful. Please. I need you now more than ever.” My wife said from her bed across the dimly lit room. 



I was trying to be as loving as possible, but I just couldn't get some images out of my head. I was desperately trying to remember my wife before that monster came into the picture, but it was so hard. 



Her face went from sad to an over-exaggerated pout. In an attempt to make a sad puppy-dog face. She tried to make the cutest faces she could.  



I got closer and closer to her and her happiness grew. I ended up sitting on her bed with her.

She leaned close to me and puckered her lips. I gave in and had a blissful kiss with my wife…



Until she bit down.   



I tried to pull away, but she had such a grip, I could tell I'd badly hurt my lip if I resisted. Instead, we both sat in silence. Her breathing got slow and deep as my heart rate increased. She slowly loosened her bite but stayed uncomfortably close to my face.



“Say a word and I will scream.” She whispered.



Before I could process what was happening, she reached for my hand and grabbed my pinky. Then she violently forced it the wrong way. I screamed in pain as I heard the snap of my finger breaking. My ears were ringing in shock. As I reacted, my wife did as well. 



“Get away from me you horrible monster! Get off of me! Don't you dare touch me!” She yelled at the top of her lungs. 



I backed away from her. Confused and shocked medical staff ran into our room.



“What the hell is happening here?” A tall man said.



“Sir, thank goodness you are here. My husband is trying to hurt me. He is the one who gave me these injuries, I didn't want to tell anyone because I was too scared he would hurt me even more. Please help me. Now he is trying to hurt me again!” She desperately cried.



“No, no! Do not believe her. Look at what she did to my lip and my finger. I'm the one who needs help, this woman is torturing me.” I said pleading to the staff as a nurse chimed in.



“Those look like wounds of a woman defending herself, buddy, don't play the victim.” 



“No, please. Someone has to help me. This isn't my wife. This is a monster. She is manipulating you all.” I finished my sentence as two large security guards came to take me out. 



As I left the room, I turned back to look at that thing sitting in the hospital bed. It grinded at me. It was still playing a game. Still scaring me to my very core.



I made it outside with the two security guards and they helped me into a cop car.



As we drove, I saw my whole life falling apart before my eyes. I realized I was probably going to jail. She would find her way to make me seem guilty of abuse and who knows what else. She would bend the truth. She even had my own brother on her side. Not only did I come to terms with going to jail, but with the fact that my wife was gone. Even if my real wife was still alive, I've been through so much trauma with that monster, that I can never see her the same again. At that moment, my whole world was shattered. 



I felt emotions inside me bubbling up. I felt sadness, pain, anger, all so strong I didn’t know what to do. Just as I fought off my tears I was jolted out of my depression with the cop car swerving off the road suddenly. 



Every part of my body tensed up as the car flipped and went into a ditch. I was dizzy, but somehow still lucid. I managed to get my seatbelt unbuckled but soon found myself in an awkward position just lying in the flipped car waiting for help. The two officers in the front seat were passed out. I was pretty sure one of them was dead by looking at him. 



After lying in the flipped car weighing my options, I saw someone walking around the car. I yelled for help but my heart sank when I realized it was her. 



Suddenly, the car that just moments ago made me feel trapped now felt like my saving grace. The only thing separating me and that monster.



I did my best to keep my eye on where she was, but she managed to get around too fast. Before I knew it she reached through the broken window, grabbed my ankles, and ripped me out of the car. I could feel the glass shards ripping at my skin as she forced me out. 



She got me out and dragged me a couple feet away from the car. 



She stood above me. Straddling me. Her arms were blooded from pulling me out of the car. 



She got closer to me slowly. Eventually sitting on my chest. As she got close, I could see how bad she looked. Her hair was knotted and ratty. Her skin looked dry and weathered. My whole body ached at the sight of her. If this was my wife something was really wrong. 



“Wasn’t that thrilling?” She remakes with a crazed look in her eye. 



“Stop it! Just stop it! I will leave you and get a restraining order against you. I will do anything in my power to get away from you.” I pleaded with her weight on my chest. 



“Ha! How do you think you’ll get away with that? I have everyone on my side. I have written evidence that makes me seem innocent. No one will ever believe you. You are putty in my hands.” 



“Is this what you want? For me to go to jail? To make me look like an abusive, sexually corrupt man? Why are you doing this?” I said with desperation. 



“Go to jail? Who said I wanted you to go to jail? Who do you think stopped the cop car? The tooth fairy?” She said with a chuckle and twisted smile.



“Then why did you tell all those lies about me? Why are you trying to make me look guilty and then the next minute save me?” 



“If you go to jail the chase is over. You will be protected by the jail walls and steel bars that keep us separated. I won’t be able to keep scaring you. Jail would be freedom for you. Freedom from me.” 



“What if I would rather go to jail than have you constantly lurking around every corner?” I said with squinted eyes. She met my gaze and got even closer. She whispered something that sent a chill down my spine. 



“Go to jail and give up finding your beautiful bride?” 



“You sick bastard!” I said as I tried to sit up to grab her, but she pinned my arms down. “You thought because of the little stunt I pulled I was making up a lie about your wife still being out there? Don’t be silly. You know your wife. She would never act like this.” 



“How do I know you aren’t bluffing?” I said as my eyes filled with hate. 



“Think of it this way. Would you rather keep looking for her your whole life, then on your deathbed realize it was all a lie? Or go to jail and realize on your deathbed that your real wife was alive the whole time. Trapped away somewhere. Desperately waiting for her knight in shining armor to come to save her. But he never came. What a shame that would be, huh?” She uttered with a soft maniacal tone. 



“Who are you? Why are you doing this?” 

I said as she let go of my wrists and sat up. And began to speak in a normal cheering tone. 



“What do you mean, goofball? I’m your wife. I’m doing it because I love you.” 



I felt even more scared to see her attitude shift so suddenly. I could see what she was trying to do. Showing me how she could manipulate me and others. 



She got off of me and walked a few feet away. 



“More cops will be here soon. I will keep them off your trail so you have time to get away. But don’t get too comfy. Wherever you go I will find you. Once I find you, keep running. I want you to keep having a sense of getting away from me. I want you to feel safe so I can take that feeling away from you again.” 



I rose to my feet. Looking at her in awe. I knew I couldn’t be completely confident in my real wife still being alive, but the thought of her in a cold room, waiting for me echoed through my head. I had to keep running. I had to keep looking. Even if that was exactly what she wanted from me. 



I started to run. I ran with no clue where I was going. I didn’t have a home to go to. Nowhere was safe. I was hopeless. 



I spent the next several months running away. I hitchhiked and found odd jobs. I even found a super sketchy doctor's office that took some cash I had in my wallet. I had to get some help with the injuries I sustained. 



A few separate times I thought I was safe. I thought I had outrun the police and more importantly, my ‘wife’. 



The first time I realized she found me, I opened the door to find bloodied teeth all over my doorstep. I was in the next place for about six weeks but kept getting ding-dong-ditchers. I thought it was just kids, but no kid would be doing it on the hour every hour for days straight.



That brings us to the current day. I won't give details on my location in case she is reading this, however,  I'm not completely sure if she has found me or not. Sometimes I hear scraping on the outside of the house, or what sounds like something inside my walls. I tell myself it's just animals because it makes me feel better. She might be trying to be less obvious so I stop running. 



I was relieved at first that she wasn't doing anything too terrifying, but then I realized it's worse to not know if it's her or not. 



I've been spending most of my time hoping and praying that my real wife is still out there. I can't help look for her as well as I'd like, given I'm very far from home. I worry that if I just sit around and wait they will never find her. Not as long as that thing pretends to be my wife. 



My biggest fear of all is that she is my real wife. Is she giving me false hope so I have a reason to stay out of jail and a reason to live? 



No, I can't believe that. I will never give up hope. 



I love you Katlyn, and I will keep looking for you.",4,1728531526.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1g0a075,https://www.reddit.com/r/zorinos/comments/1g0a075/guide_installing_zorin_os_on_0607_intel_core2duo/,Guide: Installing Zorin OS on '06-'07 Intel Core2Duo Macs using Ventoy and 32-bit GRUB bootloader,"I've been sitting on some older Macs and made various attempts to get them to run modern software.  In the past I've suffered through modifying the various .iso's, writing countless images to flash drives, and suffering quirky behaviors of linux on Apple hardware.  There was for a long while I had Manjaro running pretty well!  Finally I got fed up fiddling with them because of the trouble. 

To enable the early Intel Macs to boot 64-bit OS' here's the thing...  When Apple switched to Intel from Power PC processors, the CoreDuo was the hotness, and its 32-bit architecture continued on what trail was blazed by PPC.  The convention on Intel was short lived when Core2Duo introduced 64-bit architecture and the later Intel i-Series of processors took hold. 

Most Core2Duo Macs from 2006 and some from 2007 were shipped with 32-bit EFI bootloaders or were restricted to 32-bit booting, despite having 64-bit processors. This limitation affected their ability to run later 64-bit only versions of macOS and evidently most any Linux OS 'out of the box'. 

TLDR: Use Ventoy and some terminal commands to boot any Ubuntu-based OS on Core2Duo Macs with this guide

Step 0) Do yourself a favor and update the SATA hard drives to Solid State and max the RAM.  It might only cost $30-$60 for decent components or you might have drives laying around. ifixit guides can help.

Step 1) Download and flash Ventoy to an 8GB or larger USB flash drive.  The drive must be backwards compatible to USB2.0, but a USB3.0+ drive works fine and makes transfering .iso's to it faster.  Ventoy is an opensource utility to allow you to toss an operating system image on the flash drive and boot it on almost anything, provided the computer's firmware has been prepared (BIOS, secureboot, etc.)

Step 2) Download Zorin OS and toss it onto the Ventoy stick.  Drag and Drop, or Copy and Paste from your downloads to the external flash drive.

Step 3) Insert the Ventoy USB into the Mac and hold Alt/Option at boot.  This will show all the drives the Mac can see to boot from.  Select the orange USB ""EFI"" drive, which will load Ventoy.

Step 4) Select Zorin OS from the Ventoy menu

Step 5) Ventoy will ask which Boot Option you want to use, ""Normal"" or ""GRUB 2"" \[Select GRUB 2\].  You'll have time to step away to get a coffee or a water.  USB2.0 is relatively slow and will take 5-10 minutes to load

Step 6) Welcome to the Live environment!  Play around with it, go ahead.  Connect an ethernet cable or try wifi, because we will need internet for a small portion below.  Select ""Install Zorin OS"" from the icon at the top left of the desktop (or you could do this right away)

Step 7) During installation, allow the installer to erase the internal hard disk.  This will wipe out Mac OS or whatever information is on the drive, so be sure that's what you want to do.  I feel it should be possible to dual boot or multi-boot, but that is not covered in this guide.

Step 8) When the installation is complete, do not reboot!  Well, you can, but it will take another 10 minutes to get back into the Live environment because the system as-installed will not boot!  Boot Repair also will not help, because they only have 64-bit loader capability (does anyone want to request they add this 32-bit to Boot Repair as an optional feature?)

Step 9) Open a Terminal window and type

    lsblk

This will list all of the attached data storage devices and partitions.  With the internal drive wiped, it should only see /dev/sda (internal SSD) and /dev/sdb (USB Ventoy stick).  Note which partition is your internal disk's EFI part /dev/sda1 and which is root /dev/sda2 - as formatted by the Zorin installer

Step 10) Mount the EFI Boot partition with

    sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot/efi

which will mount the EFI part of the drive and give it the pseudonym /mnt/boot/efi as a variable to use later (by you and GRUB)

Step 11) Similarly we'll mount the root partition 

    sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt

Step 12) This command will mount critical system folders on the root partition for use all in one go using a for loop.  Type it all in one line, but essentially each part in the first half deliminated by spaces in an array will be tossed into the $i spot one after the other 

    for i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run; do sudo mount -B $i /mnt/$i; done

Step 13) Using this command, we'll focus the terminal on the internal drive as if we were running from it so that our commands take effect on that root file system as a superuser.  

    sudo chroot /mnt

Step 14) This is the command we need to be online for, installing the 32-bit grub from online repositories.  

    apt install grub-efi-ia32-bin

Step 15) This is the command we did all the work for mounting the internal drive and generating pseudonyms for each folder.  Each option for the command will ensure the proper 32-bit stuff is loaded rather than the more contemporary 64-bit options, and define where it will be installed (on our internal drive).

    grub-install --target=i386-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=ubuntu-ia32 /dev/sda

Step 16) Finally with the GRUB bootloader configured properly, we'll have it gather all the bits and install the update.  It might complain about not finding any way to update the /dev/sdb (SD B! ) Ventoy stick, but everything else should go through. 

    update-grub

Step 17) The installation is complete! Type

    exit

To get out of the chroot environment, and then shutdown the computer.  Unplug the Ventoy stick when requested, then hit any key. 

You should now be able to boot into Zorin normally

Colt Mercer 


In the heart of the Wild West, a legend stalked the land like a shadow—the Grim Reaper. Clad in black from his wide-brimmed hat to his dust-coated boots, his six-shooter hung low at his hip, gleaming in the sun like death’s invitation. He didn’t just kill men—he collected them, dragging their souls down to hell, one unlucky bastard at a time. Nobody in Dusty Hollow dared speak his name unless whiskey loosened their tongues, and even then, it was whispered like a curse.

No man had ever survived a duel with the Reaper. Some said he was invincible, others said he was just too damn fast. But everyone agreed on one thing: when the Reaper came for you, it was already too late.

But one hot-as-hell afternoon, a new name blew in with the desert wind—a gunslinger by the name of Colt Mercer. Sharp-eyed, hard as nails, and with a reputation as a man who didn’t miss. When Colt heard about the Reaper’s reign of terror, he got that dangerous glint in his eye that said one thing—he wasn’t gonna let this ghost keep breathing. If he even was breathing.

Colt rolled into Dusty Hollow slow, like he had all the time in the world. His boots clapped against the dirt, and every head in town turned. The air was thick with tension and dust, but Colt didn’t seem to notice. He pushed open the doors to the saloon, stepping into a place where fear hung so thick you could choke on it. The patrons barely glanced at him, eyes haunted, fingers twitching nervously around their glasses.

Colt sauntered up to the bar and tapped it with two fingers. “Whiskey,” he said, voice low and rough. The bartender, Old Man Thompson, a relic himself, poured the drink with a shaking hand.

Colt downed it in one swallow, then let the glass slam on the bar. “Now,” he said, “who’s the goddamn Reaper?”

The place went dead quiet, the kind of quiet where you could hear a mouse fart. Old Man Thompson’s eyes widened, and he leaned in close. “You don’t wanna be askin’ ‘bout him, son,” the old man rasped. “Reaper don’t take kindly to folks lookin’ for him. You’ll be dead by sunset.”

Colt smirked, eyes cold as ice. “If he’s half the man they say he is, he’ll meet me in the street.” He stood up, pushing his hat down low. “I’m takin’ my chances.”

The news spread faster than wildfire: Colt Mercer was calling out the Reaper. By the time the sun started to bleed into the horizon, the whole town had gathered, lining the street like they were getting ready to watch their own funerals. Folks peeked from behind broken shutters, praying they wouldn’t see the blood they feared would spill.

Colt stood in the center of the dusty street, hand resting easy on his revolver, like he’d done this a thousand times before—and he probably had. The setting sun cast long shadows, but the town waited for one shadow in particular.

And sure as shit, the Reaper came.

He walked out of the dusk like something out of a nightmare, black as sin, his face hidden beneath that damn hat. His boots crunched in the dirt, but it was the sound of his gun, gleaming in the twilight, that made people shiver.

“You lookin’ for death, gunslinger?” The Reaper’s voice was low and cold, like the whisper of a graveyard breeze.

Colt didn’t flinch. “I’m lookin’ to send you back to whatever hell you crawled out of,” he growled. “This town belongs to the living.”

The Reaper chuckled, a dark, hollow sound that made a few men cross themselves. “Many have claimed that before you,” he said, stepping forward. “None have succeeded.”

Colt’s eyes narrowed, the world shrinking down to the Reaper’s hand, to the twitch that would decide who walked away. The crowd barely breathed. No one moved. And then, the air snapped.

They drew.

Two shots echoed in the dead air, loud enough to shake heaven and hell. Dust kicked up, swirling around them like a damned cyclone. For a second, no one knew what had happened.

Then the dust cleared.

Colt stood tall, not a scratch on him. His gun still smoked, steady as his heartbeat. The Reaper, though—he wasn’t so steady. He staggered, his black-gloved hand clutching his side, blood oozing between his fingers. His gun slipped from his grip, hitting the dirt with a thud. For the first time, the townsfolk saw something they’d never thought possible—fear in the eyes of the Grim Reaper.

Colt stepped forward, gun still raised. “You’ve lost,” he said, his voice like iron. “Now, get the fuck out of here before I finish the job.”

The Reaper’s form began to fade, like smoke caught in the wind, his face twisting in rage and pain. “You’ve bested me, gunslinger,” he hissed, his voice echoing as his body turned to shadow. “But don’t fool yourself—this ain’t over. I ain’t the end.” And just like that, he was gone, leaving nothing behind but the sound of Colt’s breath and the faint whisper of wind.

For a long beat, the town was silent, everyone too shocked to move. Then, like a dam bursting, cheers erupted. People poured into the streets, slapping Colt on the back, thanking him, some even crying. He’d done it. He’d shot down death itself.

But Colt didn’t stick around for the celebration. As the crowd swarmed, he holstered his gun, nodded to the old man behind the bar, and walked straight to his horse. He knew the job wasn’t over. He might’ve shot the Reaper down today, but darkness still stalked the land. There were more devils out there, waiting for a man like Colt to send them to their graves.

As he rode off into the blood-red sunset, Colt Mercer knew one thing for damn sure: death would come for him one day, just like it did for everyone. But today wasn’t that day.

And until then, he’d keep on fighting the shadows.



Part two 


Colt Mercer rode into the fading light, the cheers of Dusty Hollow fading behind him like the dust kicked up by his horse’s hooves. He didn’t need the praise. The job wasn’t about glory—it was about setting things right in a world that had long since stopped giving a damn. But as the wind bit at his face and the night crept in, Colt couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t finished.

A man doesn’t stare down the Grim Reaper and walk away clean. No, this was just the beginning.

Three days passed before the first one came for him.

Colt had made camp in the middle of the Badlands, under a sky littered with stars. He was sitting by the fire, chewing on a hunk of jerky, when he felt it—a shift in the air, colder than it had any right to be. He looked up, hand instinctively dropping to his gun. The firelight flickered as something—someone—emerged from the darkness.

A man stood at the edge of the firelight, tall and gaunt, his eyes hollow as if something had drained the life right out of him. His clothes were tattered, but there was a rifle slung across his back that gleamed like it had never seen a speck of dust. His voice was rough as gravel when he spoke.

“You killed him, didn’t you? The Reaper.”

Colt didn’t move, didn’t blink. “I sent him back to the shadows. You his kin?”

The man grinned, and it was the grin of someone who had long since given up on living. “You could say that. Name’s Hollow Jack. I’m the first of many who’ll be comin’ for you, gunslinger. The Reaper didn’t ride alone. There’s a whole damn posse of us, men who’ve been to the other side and came back meaner. We’re comin’ for you one by one, and we won’t stop ‘til we drag you down to hell.”

Colt stood slowly, his fingers flexing around the grip of his revolver. “Well, Jack,” he said, voice steady as stone, “if you’re here to kill me, best get on with it.”

Hollow Jack chuckled, a low, raspy sound. “You’ll regret drawin’ on the Reaper. We ain’t just men, Mercer. We’re death’s own.”

The crack of gunfire split the night before the last word even left Jack’s mouth. Colt’s hand was already back at his side, his gun smoking. Jack stood there for a second, shocked, then his body crumpled, the life draining out of him like water from a busted canteen. Colt didn’t even blink. He stepped forward, nudging Jack’s body with his boot, but there was nothing left of the man but a husk, empty and cold.

Colt kicked dirt over the fire and mounted his horse, the night feeling heavier now, like it was watching him. He knew Jack wasn’t bluffing. The Reaper didn’t ride alone—he had a goddamn army of killers, and now they’d all be coming for him.

Colt could handle that. He’d been fighting all his life, and he’d keep fighting, even if the enemies were already half-dead. He rode hard into the night, knowing the next one would come soon, and after that, another. And another.

Days passed, and sure as shit, they kept coming.

The next one was a woman they called Widow Black, a sharpshooter who could take a man’s eye out from a hundred yards without blinking. Colt found her waiting for him near a canyon pass, her rifle trained on him before he even knew she was there. But she didn’t know how fast Colt was. By the time she squeezed off a shot, Colt had already fired three rounds. She hit the ground before she even saw him draw.

Then there was Bones McGraw, a hulking brute with fists like iron who didn’t care for guns—he just wanted to beat the life out of you with his bare hands. Colt had to take him down up close, a brutal fight that left his knuckles bloody and his ribs aching, but in the end, McGraw was just another corpse in the dust.

Each one came with the same dead look in their eyes, the same promise on their lips: the Reaper’s vengeance wasn’t over. They were death’s handpicked warriors, bound to a pact forged in blood and bone, and they wouldn’t stop until Colt Mercer was just another ghost.

But Colt wasn’t about to give in. Every fight only sharpened him, made him more deadly. Each outlaw that came after him made one thing clearer—they were scared. Scared that he had bested the one thing that no man was supposed to be able to beat.

And then, one night, as Colt rode into yet another nameless town, blood dried on his shirt and a fresh bruise blooming on his jaw, he felt it again—that cold shift in the air. The kind that made your bones ache. He knew what it meant. He knew who was coming.

This time, it wasn’t just one of the Reaper’s soldiers.

The Reaper himself had returned.

Colt rode into the heart of the town, his eyes scanning the streets, waiting. He dismounted slowly, his hand hovering near his gun. The wind howled through the narrow alleyways, and the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the world in darkness.

“You couldn’t stay dead, could you?” Colt muttered to the empty street.

And then, from the shadows, the Reaper’s voice came, cold and menacing, like it had always been. “You may have bested me once, Mercer. But death don’t stay down for long. I told you this wasn’t over.”

Colt smiled grimly, his fingers tightening around his revolver. “I figured you’d come back, Reaper. I’m still ready.”

The Reaper stepped out of the darkness, his black coat billowing in the wind, his gun gleaming at his side. “You’ve killed my brothers, my sisters. But I ain’t just a man, Mercer. I am death itself.”

Colt squared his shoulders, ready for the fight of his life. “We’ll see about that.”

And with that, the two legends faced each other once more, the fate of one man—and perhaps all of Dusty Hollow—hanging in the balance.

Part three 

Colt Mercer stared down the Grim Reaper for the second time, and this time, it wasn’t about survival. It was about finishing what he started. The air between them was thick with death, the kind of silence that comes just before a storm hits. Colt’s hand hovered above his revolver, steady as ever, but he knew this fight wasn’t just any showdown. This was about more than just guns and bullets.

The Reaper grinned, his face half-shadowed beneath that wide-brimmed hat. “You think you’re ready, gunslinger?” His voice was low, cold as the grave. “I’ve crawled out of hell itself to finish this.”

Colt didn’t flinch. He’d heard every bit of shit-talk a man could before putting them in the ground, and this wasn’t any different. “You came for me once,” Colt growled, his eyes narrowing. “Didn’t go well for you then, did it?”

The Reaper’s hand twitched, just enough for Colt to catch it. He didn’t wait for a signal. Colt drew faster than most men could blink. Two shots split the night, sharp and deafening, but this time it wasn’t enough. The Reaper was faster than he’d ever been, and Colt’s bullet barely grazed his shoulder.

The Reaper fired back, and Colt felt the sting of the bullet tearing through his side. Pain ripped through him, but he didn’t go down. He’d fought through worse. He snarled, gritting his teeth as he staggered, steadying himself against the wall of the saloon. His blood ran hot, soaking his shirt, but Colt’s hand didn’t waver.

The Reaper stepped forward, slow, savoring the moment. “You should’ve stayed down, Mercer. You can’t kill what’s already dead.”

Colt’s breath came in shallow bursts, but his eyes stayed locked on the Reaper. “Then I’ll bury you so deep, no one’ll ever find your sorry ass again.”

The Reaper laughed, a harsh, metallic sound. “This time, I’m taking you to hell myself.”

With a roar, the Reaper charged, gun blazing, but Colt was ready. He dropped to one knee, ignoring the searing pain in his side, and fired three quick shots, each one finding its mark. The Reaper jerked back, stumbling, dark blood pouring from his chest. Colt stood slowly, his gun still smoking.

The Reaper hit the dirt with a dull thud, his body twitching, the life finally draining out of him for good. Colt walked up, grimacing as he pressed a hand to his side, and kicked the Reaper’s gun away. “I told you once, this town belongs to the living.”

The Reaper coughed, blood bubbling from his lips. “You’ve… won, Mercer,” he wheezed, his voice barely more than a rasp. “But you’ve pissed off something worse. He’s coming for you.”

Colt narrowed his eyes. “Who the hell’s ‘he’?”

The Reaper’s lips curled into a bloodied grin. “The one who owns all our souls. The Devil himself.”

And with that, the Reaper went still, his body crumbling into dust and bones, like he’d never been there at all. Colt stood over the pile of ash, heart pounding. The Devil? Colt had fought men who thought they were gods, but he’d never faced the devil himself.

The wind howled through the empty street, and Colt knew this wasn’t over.

The final showdown came two nights later, deep in the desert. Colt had been riding hard, chasing rumors and trying to get a feel for what was coming, but it didn’t take long. The Devil doesn’t hide—he lets you know he’s coming. Colt found himself at a crossroads, the sky choked with clouds, lightning splitting the horizon. His horse pawed nervously at the dirt, but Colt held the reins tight. He dismounted, squaring his shoulders against the wind, waiting.

Then, he appeared. Not like the Reaper, slipping out of the shadows, but like a goddamn storm rolling in. The Devil walked toward Colt, his form shifting, flickering between human and something far worse. His skin was dark as charred wood, his eyes burning like embers from a furnace. The ground hissed beneath his boots as he stepped closer.

“Well, well,” the Devil drawled, his voice smooth but laced with venom. “You’ve been causin’ me a lot of trouble, Mercer. First, you take down the Reaper, and now my whole damn crew’s lying in the dirt ‘cause of you.”

Colt’s hand rested on his revolver, blood crusted to his side from the Reaper’s bullet. “If you’re here to drag me down, you’d better get on with it,” he said, his voice hard as iron. “I ain’t afraid of you.”

The Devil chuckled, the sound rumbling like thunder. “You ain’t afraid yet. But you will be. See, I own every damned soul that’s ever crossed over. And I’m takin’ yours, one way or another.”

Colt smirked, despite the weight of what stood before him. “Well, Devil, you’ll have to earn it.”

The Devil’s eyes flared, and suddenly, flames erupted around him, the air growing thick with heat and sulfur. “You’re brave, gunslinger. Stupid, but brave.”

Colt’s hand twitched toward his gun, but the Devil shook his head, amused. “You think that little piece of metal’s gonna stop me? I am fire. I am fury. I am the end, Mercer.”

Colt’s grip tightened on his revolver. “I’ve been to hell and back, Devil. You ain’t the end of shit.”

The Devil grinned wider, flames licking at his fingertips. “Then let’s see you back that up, cowboy.”

In a flash, the Devil lunged, faster than anything Colt had ever seen. His body moved like smoke, flickering in and out of reality, a twisted mass of fire and shadows. Colt dove, rolling through the dirt as flames roared past him, singeing his coat. He drew and fired, but the bullets hissed in the air, burning up before they even touched him.

The Devil laughed, his voice booming. “You’re gonna have to do better than that!”

Colt gritted his teeth, rolling again as the ground erupted in flames. He had no idea how to fight this thing, but he wasn’t about to lie down and die. Not yet. Not after everything.

And then it hit him. The Devil wasn’t just fire and brimstone. He was pride. He was arrogance. And like every arrogant son of a bitch Colt had ever taken down, he had a weakness.

“You talk too much,” Colt spat, pushing himself up to his feet, pain flaring through his body. The Devil circled him, fire dancing around his feet, but Colt stood tall. “You’re just another loudmouth with a gun. And every loudmouth falls the same way.”

The Devil sneered. “Is that so?”

Colt grinned, blood dripping from his lip. “Damn right.” He holstered his revolver, his hand steady as stone, and waited.

The Devil’s eyes flared, his form shifting, growing larger, more grotesque. “You think you can beat me in a duel? You don’t stand a—”

Before the Devil could finish, Colt moved. Faster than a rattlesnake, his hand flew to his gun, drawing and firing three shots straight into the Devil’s heart.

The bullets tore through the flames, and for a moment, it looked like they’d just burn up. But then something shifted. The Devil staggered, his form flickering, the fire around him sputtering out.

Colt didn’t stop. He unloaded his gun into the Devil’s chest, each shot knocking the bastard back, his flames guttering until finally, with a roar that split the sky, the Devil collapsed.

His body crumbled into ash, just like the Reaper’s, and the wind carried it away.

Colt stood there, breathing hard, gun smoking. He holstered his revolver and looked out over the empty desert. The sky was clear now, the storm gone. He’d done it. He’d taken down death, and now the Devil himself.

But as Colt mounted his horse, riding off into the distance, he couldn’t shake the feeling that, even after all this, the fight wasn’t over.

Because as long as there were shadows in the world, Colt Mercer would be there, ready to face them.

Part four 

Colt Mercer had finally found peace. The kind of peace that only came after a lifetime of violence, blood, and ghosts. He had settled far from the dusty trails and outlaw towns, up in the mountains of Montana, where the air was cold and clean, and the sky stretched out forever. His cabin sat near a lake, surrounded by pine trees, with a garden his wife, Sarah, tended to daily. It was quiet here. The kind of quiet Colt had once thought impossible.

His days were slow now, filled with chopping wood, fishing, and helping Sarah in the garden. Sarah was everything he had ever needed—strong, calm, and fiercely loyal. She never asked too many questions about his past, but she knew enough. Knew the shadows that followed him, even if they hadn’t reared their ugly heads in years.

At night, Colt would sit on the porch, smoking a cigar, his lever-action rifle resting beside him. Old habits died hard. Though he hadn’t needed it in a long time, there was always a part of him that stayed ready. Just in case.

One crisp autumn evening, Colt noticed a chill in the air that didn’t belong. The kind that crawled up your spine, biting deeper than the usual Montana cold. He felt it before he saw it, the same feeling he’d had years ago when he faced the Grim Reaper and his crew.

Sarah came out with a mug of coffee, handing it to him with a smile. But her smile faltered when she saw the look in his eyes, the way his hand hovered near his rifle. “Colt?” she asked, concern washing over her face.

He didn’t answer at first, his eyes scanning the tree line. Something was coming. He could feel it in his bones. “Go inside,” he said quietly, his voice tight.

“Colt, what—?”

“Just go, Sarah,” he said, his voice harder now. “Lock the doors. Don’t come out until I tell you.”

Sarah didn’t argue. She knew that look in his eyes—the look of a man who had been through hell and expected more of it to come knocking. She hurried back inside, leaving Colt alone on the porch, his hand now resting fully on his lever-action rifle.

The wind picked up, swirling dead leaves around his feet. And then, from the shadows of the forest, he saw him.

The Devil.

Only, this time, he wasn’t wearing a human face. He wasn’t flickering between forms. He was full-on now—tall, dark as a storm cloud, his eyes burning like the hottest part of a fire. His skin was blackened, cracked like molten rock, and he strode toward Colt with a confidence that chilled the blood.

Colt stood slowly, his hand never leaving the rifle. “You just couldn’t let it go, could you?”

The Devil grinned, his voice deep and rumbling like distant thunder. “You think you can just walk away, Mercer? After everything? You beat death, you beat me, but you know better than anyone—no one gets away. Not really.”

“I reckon I did,” Colt replied, his grip tightening on the rifle. “I killed you once.”

“You sent me back,” the Devil growled, stepping closer. “But you didn’t kill me. Not fully. I’ve been waiting, watching you play house with your little wife, living like a man who ain’t got a target on his back.”

Colt’s eyes narrowed. “You’re not takin’ me or Sarah. Not this time.”

The Devil laughed, the sound dark and hollow. “This time’s different, Mercer. You’ve gotten slow. You’ve gotten soft. Look at you—out here in the middle of nowhere, thinking you can hide from what’s owed.”

Colt raised the rifle slowly, leveling it at the Devil’s chest. “Ain’t nothing owed to you but a bullet.”

The Devil’s eyes flared. “You think that old gun’s gonna stop me? You think you’re still that fast?”

Colt didn’t hesitate. He cocked the lever, feeling the familiar weight of the rifle in his hands, the muscle memory that had never faded. He pulled the trigger, the shot ringing out through the cold mountain air.

The bullet hit the Devil square in the chest, and for a moment, Colt felt a flicker of hope. But the Devil just staggered back, laughing, flames flickering where the bullet hit.

“You’re gonna need more than that, gunslinger,” the Devil sneered, his form rippling with dark energy.

Colt pumped the lever again and fired another shot, and then another. But each time, the Devil just shrugged them off, stepping closer, fire spreading across the ground with each step.

Desperate, Colt backed up toward the cabin, his mind racing. He needed more firepower. Something stronger. And then he remembered the old rounds he’d kept locked away—the silver-tipped bullets he’d made after the first time he’d faced the Reaper. Just in case.

He kicked the cabin door open, shouting over his shoulder, “Sarah, get down!”

He dove inside, slamming the door behind him. The Devil’s laugh echoed outside, but Colt didn’t waste time. He grabbed the silver bullets from the hidden drawer, loading them into the rifle with quick, practiced hands.

Sarah peeked around the corner, wide-eyed. “Colt, what—?”

“It’s him,” Colt said, grimly. “The Devil.”

Sarah’s eyes widened, but she didn’t scream. She just nodded. “Do what you have to.”

Colt kissed her quickly, then turned back toward the door, rifle in hand. He stepped outside again, the silver bullets gleaming in the moonlight. The Devil stood there, flames licking at the trees now, his smile wide and cruel.

“This is your last chance, Mercer,” the Devil growled. “Come with me, and I’ll make it quick. Fight, and I’ll burn this whole place to the ground.”

Colt leveled the rifle one last time. “You ain’t taking me, and you sure as hell ain’t touchin’ my wife.”

The Devil lunged, faster than anything human, but Colt was ready. He fired one perfect shot, the silver bullet slamming into the Devil’s chest, cutting through the fire, through the darkness.

The Devil screamed, a sound so loud it shook the mountains. His body convulsed, fire flaring wildly before sputtering out. He staggered, his form collapsing in on itself, turning to ash as Colt fired another shot, and then another, until there was nothing left but a pile of smoldering dust.

The wind blew the ashes away, scattering them into the night.

Colt lowered the rifle, breathing hard, his heart pounding in his chest. It was over. Finally.

He turned back toward the cabin, where Sarah stood in the doorway, watching. She didn’t say a word, just wrapped her arms around him as he reached her.

“Is it done?” she asked quietly.

Colt looked out at the empty forest, the night silent and still. “Yeah,” he said, holding her close. “It’s done.”

And for the first time in a long, long while, Colt Mercer truly believed it.

This subreddit helped me a lot, so I thought maybe my story will help someone too. Also please note that these are steps that helped me personally, this is not a medical advice and I do acknowledge that some people might not be able to do the same due to their own life circumstances.

Spoiler: it wasn't easy and it took a lot of time. I'm 32 yo, 165 cm and was 55 kg in the beginning of my journey.

My symptoms: constant bloating since I remember myself (not after eating, by constant I mean constant to the point when I couldn't even tell if it was a reaction for certain foods because I never felt better/worse, I was constantly severely bloated), constipation, constant fatigue.

**What I did and saw no difference**

1. Went to GI specialist. Colonoscopy & gastroscopy. They found no reasons for my symptoms apart from very minor Helicobacter pylori that they said I don't even need to treat.
2. Went to a nutritionist. With nutritionist I did the following:   

* a. Did GI-Map test. It showed dysbacteriosis, signs of leaky gut and  minor Helicobacter pylori. I didn't have Methane overgrowth.    
* b. Eliminated lactose, gluten, coffee, beans, sodas, sugar, vegetable oils (but I've never had sugar in my diet in the first place).    
* c. Ordered 800$ worth of supplements: Betaine HCI Pepsin and Gentian Bitters, Ox bile, Mastic Gum, L Carnitine, Saccharomyces Boulardii, Grapefruit extract, Slippery elm, DGL, Magnesium, Vit B, Vit A & D, Bromelain, Spirulina, CoQ10, Humic Minerals, Slymarin, Digestive Enzymes, Epicor, Phosphatidyl choline complex, some Detox complex I don't remember the name of. I'm gef forgetting something since it was quite some time ago.

3. Paid for Nerva IBS and followed it religiously every day for 8 weeks. For those who don't know it's a hypnotherapy app that allegedly fixes the miscommunication between gut and brain.

I've been on the diet and supplements suggested by my nutritionist for 4 months. In the middle of this protocol I started listening to Nerva every day. Also I did high paced yoga every day for a month because a friend of mine told me it helped her. I haven't seen any difference in my bloating or energy levels.

**When things have changed**

I went on vacation to Japan and SK for a month and after 2 weeks I noticed that my bloating reduced significantly. What was different during my vacation:

a. It was extremely hot and humid and I found myself eating 2 times a day - around 10 am and then at around 4-5 pm due to lack of appetite. I wasn't on any diet and ate everything I wanted, but it should be noted that what I wanted was: lots of meat & fish, salads, occasional noodles & rice, black coffee, matcha, water. Before the vacation, my diet was mainly carbs based with me low key trying to hit at least 30g of protein daily (I would have rice & fish or pasta & beef etc).  
b. I was walking around 15-20k steps every day in +35 degrees and extreme humidity. Back home I sat in front of the laptop for 9 hours.  
c. Stress was down due to absence of work.  
d. On a side note, I took remaining Betaine HCI pills with me since I ordered a huge bottle and there were still some remaining. Everything else I've finished by then. Also, for the first half of my trip I continued listening to Nerva IBS.

After I was back from my vacation, I maintained my protein based diet, but I started eating 3 times a day again and my step count reduced dramatically due to job. Bloating was back. I was upset and tried to recreate the lifestyle I had during my vacation.

**Maintenance**

1. I went back to eating 2 times a day again. I eat at around 10-10.30 am and then at around 4.30-5 pm. I eat very slowly too. I realised that I only eat 3 times a day because I cook for my husband and have lunch with him even if I am not hungry. I now eat only when I feel hungry.
2. I have at least 30g of protein each meal (I'm 50 kg now) with salads and herbs, this is exclusive of collagen/bone broth protein. I still eat carbs like buckwheat and quinoa etc, but I significantly reduced the amount of pasta, rice and potatoes I eat. I still eat occasionally if I want to, but it's not the base of my diet anymore. I still drink black coffee.
3. I still take Betaine HCI with each meal in case I have a low acidity to help me digest protein. Plan to stop taking it in the future and see how it goes.
4. I keep walking 15k steps daily, often right after meals. It can be a bit of a challenge and also it's a bit boring imo, so I use with time to call my family members who live in a different country, and then I started jogging and swimming. Never in my life have a imagined that I would start jogging, I hated running my whole life. But I have so much energy now (probably because of protein and subsequent increase of iron levels?) that I genuinely enjoy running now.
5. I set boundaries at work and stopped getting involved in any office drama. I also cut off toxic people from my life and started prioritising people who reach out regularly and make effort in our friendship. I feel good almost all the time now.

At the moment I'm almost completely happy with my results, bloating doesn't bother me anymore and my energy levels are crazy. I plan to introduce strength and core training to my routine soon to build muscles that I'm lacking now and address the last potential reason for bloating which I haven't addressed yet (so far I addresses dysbiosis and mental health) which is core dysfunction. Hope this helps someone!",5,1728531094.0,SIBO,0,1.0,False
1g09xcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/adviceph/comments/1g09xcd/let_us_talk_about_consideration/,Let us talk about consideration.,"Hi! I'm 24 (f) and I have a coffee shop inside a school, in which may cook (na pinsan) and cashier na staff. Mag-asawa sila. We also do mga pautang sa mga students and teachers. Most of the time sila lang naiiwan sa cafe kasi may full time work ako and minsan ako nag aalaga ng baby nila. They also live with me. 

Just last week, lumala sakit ng mother nung cashier which caused them to take an emergency leave. Friday after duty nagsabi sila and namoblema ako agad kasi may special event sa school ng saturday and we need to open. So, I had to take an emergency leave din para may tumao sa saturday and sa mga susunod na araw. Hindi nila naturn over sa akin yung mga palista and ibang things about the cafe since nga nagmamadali. I thought ang flight nila ay Saturday ng madaling araw kaya sila nagmamadali. Lo, and behold saturday ng 11pm pa pala. However, I did not ask for turnover kasi that saturday morning namatay na yung mother nung cashier.

However, nacancel yung flight nila because of discrepancies and miscommunication between the family ni cashier. So, they stayed pa sa Manila ng couple of days. I asked pa how they are and if they need anything. Now, mag 1 week na since they left. 

Since wednesday, I kept messaging them about sa mga palista since nagpapile up na ang listahan at lumalaki na. Supposedly kasi nasingil na to ng friday na nagpaalam sila. Hindi ko rin masingil yung mga nasa listahan because sobrang vague ng listahan dahil minsan ang nakalagay lang ay 'J.' May iba din na di malinaw such as 'Maymay' tas may isa pang 'May.' 

Now, they called me out na hindi ko sila binibigyan ng consideration.They even told me how ungrateful am I sa kanila. I even add sa messages ko sa kanila 'pasensya na.' Am I insensitive for asking clarifications for this things? ",1,1728531093.0,adviceph,5,1.0,False

I found myself drawn to Collinsport, Maine, known for its legends of witches, ghosts, werewolves, and vampires. With the completion of my mansion not being until March of 2026, I opted to travel to cities in the US for a couple months. I drove for a 26 hours (not including the stops for food, gas, the bathroom, and staying overnight at a hotel) until I arrived in Collinsport. Once in Collinsport, I drove to the Best Western where I had a presidential suite waiting. People stared at me because of my gothic attire, and I got catcalled by a couple men, who I very angerly told to go fuck themselves. The clerk at the front desk was a kind middle aged woman who gave me the key card to my room and told me when breakfast was.


I unpacked and spent the rest of the evening doing research on the legends of Collinsport, but due to many of the legends being 150 to 200+ years old, it was like a game of Telephone. I shut my laptop, changed into my bikini that I could now confidentally wear, and went down to the pool. Luckily, the pool area was deserted, so I swam some laps on my back before relaxing in the hot tub. Soon a family with 3 very spoiled young children came into the pool area, which was my cue to leave. The mom glared at me, and it was obviously due to my makeup and choice of swimwear.


""What are you looking at?"" I asked.


The dad told his wife to chill out and leave me alone, then apologized for his wife's poor manners. I told him that it didn't really bother me too much since I was used to people harassing or being rude to me due to me being goth.


Once I returned to my room, I hung my bikini top up on the shower's curtain rod, and left my bottoms laying flat on the floor before getting in the shower. After my shower, I put on a pair of underwear, a pair of leggings with the legs cut off above the knee, and a sports bra before brushing my teeth and beginning my skin care routine.


The next morning, I put on some simple make up, a t-shirt to cover my sports bra, and a pair of flip flops so I felt confident going down for breakfast. After I was done with breakfast, I went back to my room, changed my clothes and bra, then finished my makeup. I was going to pay a visit to the nearby shopping mall to look around and ask some of the locals about what they knew about the legends of Collinsport. I figured it would be pretty much the same shit as the internet, but maybe someone knew something that wasn't on the internet.


An hour later, I found myself looking at bras in Torrid. Before my liposuction, I wore a 44DDD, but I'd dropped 1 band size before surgery, then 3 more during surgery since I'd had liposuction done on my back in addition to my abdomen, sides, neck, upper arms, and cheeks. Now I was down to a 36DDD since I left my chest alone. Since they didn't have my size available in stock, I said I'd just order what I wanted online once I returned to Florida. The lady I spoke with was a local, so I asked her about the legends, but she didn't know anymore than the internet. The next store I went into was a shop that sold crystals and insense. There was a man and woman working there, but when I asked them about the stuff that'd happened in Collinsport, the man piped up and said that there'd been strange attacks on young women all over town at night. The women would be found unconscious with two strange puncture wounds on the neck, having lost large amounts of blood. He even told me that many speculated the culprit was a vampire. I thanked him, paid for the necklaces I decided to get, then made my way to Hot Topic.


After dinner that evening, I decided that I would hang out at one of the local bars, and after searching for bars in the area, I found that the closest one was called ""The Blue Whale"" which was across the street from the Collinsport Docks, and also happened to be the hot spot for ""vampire"" attacks. Grabbing my pepper spray and switchblade for protection, I walked to the Blue Whale.


The bartender was a man in his 30s, and was very friendly. I was happy to find out that the bar had my favorite red wine available, which was a bit harder to come by outside of Michigan, where I was originally from. About 2 hours after my arrival, a man sat a couple stools away from me at the bar. He was obese, had a disgusting beard, balding, had food stains on his shirt, wore glasses, and the hair he did have was long, scraggly, greasy, and disgusting. Once he laid eyes on me, he wouldn't stop staring at my chest. Much to my dismay, he moved closer, and began harassing me. Everything about him screamed basement dweller and pervert. He asked me to comeback to his place so we could ""have some fun"". I told him to go away, but he persisted. I might've been drunk, but I knew to keep my hand over my glass incase he decided to drug me, I also noticed a verybobvious bulge in his pants that he didn't try to hide. I tried to see where the bartender was, but he was in the back fiddling with a keg and couldn't see me. The pervert's advances became more aggressive until I finally snapped. I cussed him out, then told him if he didn't shut the fuck up, stop staring at me, and leave me alone, I'd break his nose and his glasses. Furious, I paid my tab and stormed/stumbled out of the bar. I could've kicked the creep's ass even while drunk since I'd taken up kung-fu lessons, and had a sharp mind while intoxicated.


Once I was outside of the bar, I calmed down, but was still a bit irritated. The moon was out, and its light reflected off of the water in the harbor. Looking at the moonlight on the water helped calm me even more due to its beauty, but I sensed I wasn't alone out there. If the perv had followed me out there, they would be carting him away from the bar in an ambulance because I would've pepper sprayed him and kicked his ass.


I was just about to start walking back to the hotel when I heard a tin can clatter across the ground. When I turned my head, I saw a tall and very pale man with jet black hair that was wearing a cape like coat carrying a black cane with a silver wolf's head. I smiled a little, and the man looked at me with a sad longing, like I reminded him of someone he once loved.


""I'm terribly sorry, I didn't mean to startle you."" He apologized.


""You didn't startle me, I sensed I wasn't alone out here. I'm Lydia by the way.""


""I'm Barnabas Collins.""


I told him about the pervert in the bar who sexually harassed me, threatening to break the pervert's nose, and that I was in Collinsport to learn about the supernatural legends surrounding the town. He invited me back to his house to discuss them, but I counter offered with allowing him just to hang out in my presidential suite at the Best Western, making it clear that no sexual activity was taking place since I was asexual. The real reason for my doing this is if he tried something, he couldn't get away with it as easily.


I led him back to my hotel room, and offered him some wine, but he politely turned it down, so I poured myself a glass, took off my combat boots and my socks, then sat down in an arm chair, propping my feet up on the coffee table, taking care to cross my legs since I was wearing a skirt despite the fact that I was wearing my legging shorts under the skirt.


Barnabas let me tell him about the mansion being built in Florida, getting a nose piercing before having my liposuction and tummy tuck, getting tattoos after the last of the blood thinners were out of my system, dying my hair, getting my upper canines modified to look like fangs, and my fruitless efforts to learn more about the legends of Collinsport.



He told me everything he knew about the legends of Collinsport, but he seemed to be holding something back that was important. Barnabas then asked me to tell him some more things about myself. I told him I'd never had my first kiss, been on a date, or had a boyfriend. My phone's notification went off on the otherside of the room, and when I went to go get my phone, I stumbled due to how drunk I was.


Barnabas asked me if I could be his first kiss, and I said yes as long as I could have his number. I stood up and he came close to me. This is when I got a closer look at him in the light. 


""Why are your eyes red?"" I asked.



""Don't be afraid of me my love."" He replied, and when he spoke while being a few inches away as opposed to about 5 feet away in the lamp light, that's when I saw his fangs.


He bent down and kissed my lips. His lips were ice cold. As we kissed each other, he moved his lips down to my neck, the points of his teeth grazing my skin. There was a pause, then I felt what felt like two tiny daggers pierce the skin on my neck before blood started to pour out of the two punctures. I let out a whimper and a groan due to the pain. Barnabas began to suck on my neck and lick up the blood. As the seconds passed, I grew weaker, but soon he pulled away from my neck, rolled up his sleeve, then bit his own wrist which caused it to bleed.


""Drink."" He commanded.


I took a few drops of his blood, then collapsed. I could feel him putting an arm under my legs and lifting me as if I weighed nothing before laying me on the bed then pulling the blankets up to my shoulders. After that, I was completely out cold.",1,1728530666.0,u_Wealthy_Vampire,0,1.0,False
1g09sph,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/1g09sph/read_the_mind_of_the_author/,Read the mind of the author,"# Introduction

Many times, in a Reading Comprehension passage, the author may present the viewpoints of other personalities on the topic of discussion. These personalities may hold their views against or for the topic. As a test taker, we must know whether the author agrees with, disagrees with, or remains neutral to the viewpoints of these personalities. ""But how do we know the author's stance?"" you may wonder. The answer is simple. The author provides the answer in the passage itself. We must be alert when picking up those cues. Through this article, we will study official passages to determine whether the author possesses the same feather to flock with them or has different strokes to refute them. 

# 1. Author as part of the flock

**A. Official Passage Analysis**

The following is the first paragraph of an official passage.

*Defined as an aggregate measure of production equal to the sum of the gross values added of all resident institutional units engaged in production, plus and taxes, and minus any subsidies, on products not included in the value of their outputs, GDP is a basic standard to measure the standard of living in a country and in turn the economic well-being of the population.* ***However, critics are of the opinion that national GDP figures do not reveal significant regional variations in output, employment and incomes per head of population***\*. They\* ***justly*** *contend that within each region there are areas of relative prosperity contrasting with unemployment black-spots and deep-rooted social and economic deprivation and that GDP figures on their own do not represent the distribution of income and the uneven spread of financial wealth*.

[Passage 1 Explained](https://preview.redd.it/jaem87yilutd1.png?width=1194&format=png&auto=webp&s=3837b1af5e28590c774367e03b8e052d390408c7)

The author starts the second paragraph of the same passage as follows: *The idea that rising national prosperity can still be accompanied by rising relative poverty is* ***rightly*** *at the heart of the criticism meted out for using GDP as a measure of the general well-being of the population of a region*. The presence of the highlighted word once again proves that ***the author holds the same viewpoint on the use of the GDP as the critics***.

**B. Words/Phrases Indicating Author’s agreement**

Since the onus is on the author to help readers know that the author agrees with the viewpoints of some other entities in the passage, the author may use such affirmative expressions as *justly, rightly, correctly, legitimately, indeed, undoubtedly, certainly, without question, understandably*, etc. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list. The affirmation from the author may appear in various other phrases and sentences as well.

# 2. Author in refutation of the viewpoints of other personalities

**A. Official Passage Analysis**

Let’s study the following official passage now:

…*These scholars have contended that from 1794 to roughly 1830, American inventors were unable to enforce property rights because judges were “antipatent” and routinely invalidated patents for arbitrary reasons.* ***This argument is based partly on examination of court decisions in cases where patent holders (“patentees”) brought suit alleging infringement of their patent rights.*** *In the 1820s, for instance, 75 percent of verdicts were decided against the patentee. The proportion of verdicts for the patentee began to increase in the 1830s, suggesting to these scholars that judicial attitudes toward patent rights began shifting then.*

*Not all patent disputes in the early nineteenth century were litigated,* ***however***\*, and litigated cases were not drawn randomly from the population of disputes.\* ***Therefore the rate of verdicts in favor of patentees cannot be used by itself to gauge changes in judicial attitudes or enforceability of patent rights***.

[Passage 2 Explained](https://preview.redd.it/a1wpp9lllutd1.png?width=1210&format=png&auto=webp&s=03a50d0fcce75678678792afd16408787f5cfe6a)

 **B. Words/Phrases Indicating Author’s Refutation or Disagreement**

The author may use such expressions as *however, nevertheless, nonetheless, on the contrary, conversely, in contrast, mistakenly, erroneously, fallaciously*, etc., to present their disagreement with the viewpoints of other entities mentioned in the passage. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list. The refutation can be expressed through many other phrases and sentences.  

# 3. Author remains neutral

It is not necessary for the author to either agree or disagree with the viewpoints of other personalities mentioned in the passage. The author may choose to remain neutral and not present at all their own opinion on such viewpoints. In such cases, the viewpoints of other entities are stated as factual statements.

**A. Official Passage Analysis**

Let’s study the first paragraph of this official passage:

*According to Christopher Leo, reviewing Douglas Rae's book City: Urbanism and Its End, Rae draws on his experience as a city manager to argue that the most dramatic and direct contribution of automobiles to urban decline was to overwhelm city centers with traffic congestion, rather than to make urban residents' flight to the suburbs easier. Leo says this contradicts conventional wisdom among scholars of urbanism*.

[Passage 3 explained](https://preview.redd.it/q5x0d1znlutd1.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=827aa3517b1f77dbfb42b45ec1b1990a42c96b3a)

So, we do not hear anything from the author personally about Leos’s views on Rae’s work. The second paragraph of this passage also contains only Leo’s criticism of Rae’s “biased” considerations in writing this book. Absolutely nowhere in the passage does the author either take the side of any of these two personalities or go against them.

# 4. Author makes their stance clear

So, whenever the author presents the viewpoints of some other personalities in an RC passage, all we need to do is read through the passage carefully to pick up those apparent clues that the author incorporates to make his stance very clear whether they agree or disagree with those personalities as we saw in the two official passages above.

* If the author agrees with the viewpoints of the other people, they will EXPLICTLY use affirmative expressions to show their agreement.
* If they do not, then that will also be CLEARLY indicated in the passage through the expressions used by the author.
* The absence of positive and negative expressions sugggests that the author is neutral to the viewpoints of the other people mentioned in the passage.  

# Takeaway

In the world of the GMAT RC, the author of the passage is our best friend because we deal with a passage that they have written. So, the words and phrases they use become our guide that helps us navigate the passage. In this article, we learned how to determine if the author agrees with, disagrees with, or remains neutral to the viewpoints of other personalities mentioned in the passage. But why is it so important to know this? If this is the question that is arising in your mind, then stay tuned. Soon, we will present the answer to this critical question.

Till then, Happy Learning!

And try your hand at these exercise questions to solidify your understanding.

***Passages***

1.     The theory that dinosaurs were cold-blooded has long been accepted. Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests this view is mistaken, as it fails to account for the high growth rates observed in dinosaur fossils.

2.     Many historians have debated the causes of the Industrial Revolution. Professor Smith's theory, which emphasizes the role of technological innovation, is undoubtedly the most convincing explanation to date.

3.     It has been proposed by some economists that cryptocurrency could eventually replace traditional currencies. Proponents argue that it offers more security and transparency.

4.     In the debate over climate change policy, one perspective is that market-based solutions are most effective. Advocates of this approach contend that carbon pricing would drive innovation in clean technologies.

5.     The new healthcare policy has faced significant opposition. However, proponents of the policy justly emphasize its potential to reduce costs and improve access for millions of citizens.

6.     Proponents of the new urban development plan claim it will revitalize the city center. This argument, however, ignores the potential displacement of long-time residents and local businesses.

7.     According to recent studies, coffee consumption may have health benefits. Some researchers suggest that moderate coffee intake could reduce the risk of certain diseases.

8.     Critics argue that the current economic model is unsustainable. They rightly point out that infinite growth is impossible in a world of finite resources.

1g09opq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/1g09opq/should_we_fire_our_nannybabysitter/,Should We Fire Our Nanny/Babysitter,"Hello, Everyone!

I’m reaching out because I’m feeling quite overwhelmed and could use some input, Before I lose it. As first-time parents, my husband and I are navigating this new world on our own, without any family nearby to lend a hand. Given our high-powered jobs, Mine being from home and his in the office, We decided to hire a nanny or babysitter although I’m not entirely sure what to call her.

Our nanny has a whopping 12 years of experience. She’s done everything from managing estates as a nanny to teaching preschool and even being a IRS instructor, She volunteers her time hosting a group of homeless moms in the park with snacks and story telling. She’s a staunch advocate for structure and keeps us updated with an endless stream of baby books and articles that she unfortunately insists on sharing with me.

Here’s the kicker: while I appreciate her dedication, I can’t shake the feeling of inadequacy. She arrives early, cleans, steams and purées baby food for the week, and is always organizing. She even manages our dogs while maintaining a flawless schedule. I’ve never seen her take a break to drink a coffee or make a meal, And she seems to thrive on the chaos, When our baby even cries she doesn’t even seem frustrated or bothered. 

Thanks to her, our baby’s sleep has dramatically improved from just a 4 hours at night in total to a glorious 8-9 hours, with two long naps during the day lasting 2-3 hours each. Our little one is thriving crawling, climbing, and even saying “mama” and “dada.” When the nanny is here, everything seems perfect, and our babygirl is all smiles.

But here’s the issue: as soon as the babysitter leaves, our baby screams out. I’m left with long, detailed notes on what they did together, and it feels like a gut punch  reminder of how I’m apparently falling short. I’m at my wits’ end trying to figure out how to reclaim my role as a mother without feeling like I’m in constant competition with this superwoman.

My husband thinks we should raise our babysitters hourly rate because she’s in high demand, Our friends have been begging for her number and doing such a “great” job. But honestly? I’m not sure I even want to keep her.

Sure, she’s organized and keeps our babygirl on a strict schedule, while keeping her happy but it feels like she’s trying to run the show. I can’t help but think I should just find someone else who doesn’t make me feel like a complete failure every time she leaves.

Why should I pay more for someone who makes me feel so inadequate? Am I being unreasonable here? 

Has anyone else experienced this? How do you manage these feelings? I’d love some advice!",0,1728530267.0,Nanny,17,0.29,False

He took some allergy meds but it took days to shrink. Made an appt to see a nurse (we have no Drs in our rural town) and she didn't seem concerned and said something about a salivary gland. It swells off and on. Mainly when coffee or alcohol is involved. We've obviously been concerned and he had an ultrasound done at the nearest city yesterday.

1g09mh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g09mh1/im_trapped_outside_my_own_body/,I’m Trapped Outside My Own Body,"“You need a hobby,” said Sal.

He saw me eyeing the girl at the end of the bar.

“I got a hobby,” I laughed, still watching her.

“I meant something besides...well you know,” he replied. 

“Maybe a hobby with more meaning, something you find interesting,” he continued. 

“What? My current hobby isn't interesting enough?” I asked.

“Obviously not, if it was enough, I wouldn't have to have to hear you bitch every night about how much your life sucks,” Sal replied.

“Fuck off Sal,” I replied, unable to hide my annoyance.

Sal and I worked together, a simple office job. The pay was good and hours were a simple nine to five. Once we got out of work for the day we always went to the same bar for a few drinks. Life wasn’t bad...it was just so fucking boring. Every year that fled us, I got more and more depressed. Is this all I am ever going to do?  For the rest of my life? 

Sal and I always talked about this, usually started by me. For some reason he never had the same fear as me. Though he understood my frustration in life, he was still so content with his. It drove me mad. How the fuck was he so content with everything? We were both single, never married, never had any kids. Hell we both never even left our city, let alone state. We both followed the same path in life. Graduated high school, went to college, and then got a “good” but boring ass job. Our parents must have been so…”proud”.

“It sucks man. I feel like a goddamn goldfish, swimming in circles until it's time to be flushed down the toilet,” I said. 

“Come on, it's not so bad,” Sal replied. “We got a comfortable living,” he finished.

Sal always tried to be the voice of reason. 

“Thats the fucking problem! It’s comfortable. Comfortable usually means boring,” I said.

“Take a vacation then,”

“That’s only temporary,”.

“Go back to school and get a new degree”

“Takes too much time and money”.

“Oh for fucks sake! Sell drugs and become a kingpin then! Like ‘Breaking Bad’!” Sal finally said in exasperation. 

“Hmmm maybe I should!” I replied, trying to sound sarcastic.

Sal didn't know if I was joking or not.

“That was sarcasm,” I mocked.

At that moment, I noticed the girl get up and start walking towards us. My heart jumped a bit in excitement. I opened my mouth to say something, but she quickly cut me off.

“I'm not here for that,” she quickly said. 
My smile disappeared. 

“Oh my god, shut down!” Sal laughed.

“Shut the fuck up Sal, ” I frustratedly said. 

“What can we do for you then?” I asked her.
 
“I didn't mean to, but I couldn't help overhearing what you guys were talking about. Your friend is right you need a hobby,” she said.

“Wow what great insight! My problems are fucking solved!” I said, my tone dripping with sarcasm.

“Let me finish, asshole. I was in a similar situation as you. I tried a lot of crazy shit to bring some excitement to my life. Nothing worked until I tried one thig that changed my life forever,” she said

“What...what did you do?” Sal asked in a quiet and nervous tone.

She smiled.

“Tell me, what do you guys know about astral projection?”




I started laughing. I was never a religious or spiritual person, so that was my first instinct. 

“What is that, like meditation?” I asked.
She smiled.

“It’s...a method. A way for your spirit to temporarily leave your body,” she answered.

Sal looked very uncomfortable. He was always a religious man who took his faith seriously. 

“That sounds like the work of the devil. Your soul is only supposed to leave your body when you die,” he quietly said.

She turned to him.

“Maybe this has nothing to do with god or the devil. We, humans, are spiritual beings in a universe we know nothing about. This is just a way to possibly help us gain some new insight on life,” she replied to him.

Sal didn't reply. He just stared at her with the same nervous look. 

I laughed again. 

“You guys are both hilarious arguing over different fairy tales. Tell you what, if I ever drop acid or some other crazy drug Ill try your little astral projection. It should be fun in that state of mind,” I said with another inconsiderate laugh.

“Look you're the one complaing about life. Im just offering you something to try. You don't have to believe in it, but there's no harm in trying something new, especially in your state of mind,” she said.

“You boys enjoy your night,” she said and turned to leave.

“Wait what's your name?” I asked her.

“It doesn't matter, we won't see each other again,” she cooly replied. 

And with that she was gone. Sal looked more relaxed now that she left.

“Look I know your not a believer but no matter what, do not listen to her. Her idea is...dangerous,” Sal suddenly said.

“Whatever Sal, you know I think both of you are full of shit,” I replied.

“Good,” he simply said.

I lied. It's true I didn't believe either of them, but part of me was interested. I always prided myself on being as logical as possible. It's why I called myself an agnostic. Sure I didn’t believe in a god, or gods for that matter, but I admit I was to stupid to say they don't exist either. I wasn’t arrogant, just because I didn't believe in anything outside this life, that doesn’t mean there isn't anything out there. I hated to admit it, but this whole “astral projection” did peek my intrest. 

When I arrived home I went online and read all I could about it. It was like she said. Astral Projection was a way for your spirit or soul to leave your body for a time. All sources said something different about where your soul goes. Some say you just remain in this world but can go anywhere you choose. Others said you move into the world of purgatory. Another source said you enter another dimension and can see the true nature of the universe.

“What a bunch of bull. What the fuck am I doing?” I scolded myself. 

I turned off the computer and went to bed, I had work early the next day. All night I tossed and turned. I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about the girl from the bar and what she said. The worst thought entered my head and that was the “What if?”. 

What if she was right? What if against all my beliefs, there was something else out there? What if this was what I had been searching for? What...fucking...if?
I decided right then and there that if I was right and it was all bull I had nothing to lose. I decided that night that I would give this “astral projection” a try,



I took the next week to do as much research as possible, Before I even attempted anything, I wanted to have as much information at my disposal. I learned how astral projection was not just simple meditation, but also that you had to visualize yourself leaving your own body. Just like meditation, I had to be at complete peace with myself, no thoughts in your head aside from your goal. I tried for weeks, for hours everyday, all for nothing. I was starting to get fed up, 

“This is some bullshit, what am I doing?” I yelled at myself. I was ready to give up, but then I remembered what I read online. 

“You must be patient and at complete peace,” it said.

I took a deep breath and closed my eyes. I forced myself to clear my mind of everything. My job, my parents, my life, my reasons for doing this, every thought was shut out from my head. For the first time in my life I had no thoughts. For the first time, I found peace. 

I thought about my goal. I tried hard to visualize myself leaving my body. I focused on what felt like hours, when I suddenly realized something. I wasn’t breathing! With that realization I opened my eyes in panic when and couldn’t believe what I saw. My panic was replaced by astonishment. I was looking at….myself. 

I could see myself sitting with crossed legs, in the middle of my room. I was hovering a few feet from my body and the floor. I wasn’t breathing but I could see my body was. I could see my physical forms chest inhaling and exhaling calmly. While I stared in disbelief, all of a sudden I felt a force start pulling me back into my body. I couldn't fight it! It was over within a few seconds. I opened my eyes and gasped for breath. My heart was racing. I looked around the room and then at my own hands. I felt myself calm a bit and collapsed on the floor. I laughed. I couldn’t believe it. I actually had done it for a brief while! I successfully left my own body! 

It's been two weeks since the first time I left my body. I was getting better at it. I was able to last longer outside my body. It started off just a few seconds, but now I could remain out for over an hour before I was forced back into my body. Whatever “it” was, it felt like a muscle. The more I used it, the stronger it got. 
One night I was brave enough to finally leave the room my body was in. I Worked my way towards my door and tried to open it. My band went right through! 

“I wonder,” I thought to myself.

I tried to walk through the door and to my amazement it worked! I found myself in the small hallway outside my room. I was like a ghost! I could go through anything because I was not in a physical form. At that moment I had an idea. 

“I wonder what my landlord's wife is up to right now,” I said to myself. 

They lived directly above me. It was only midday and I knew that he wasn't home. Instead of taking the stairs I had another idea. In this form, if i can move through doors and walls, I Should be able to move through ceilings as well! I concentrated as hard as I could and found myself slowly floating off my floor, and straight through the ceiling. 

I found myself in their kitchen. It was such an average looking kitchen. You wouldn't think that they were owners of any property. My landlord was an asshole. He always tried to act like he was rich, flashy cars, flashy dress wear. Yet his kitchen was so...plain. I laughed. It was all a show for other people.  I made my way through the kitchen and through his apartment. His living room was just as dull. A tv, a couch, a plant or two lying around, but nothing else. No pictures, no paintings, nothing. I kept moving until I saw a closed door.

“Must be the bedroom,” I thought to myself.

I tried using the knob only for my hand once again, to go through it. 

“Of course,” I laughed to myself. I still had to get used to being in this form. I walked through the closed door only to be paralyzed with a pleasant shock. Here was my landlord's wife, with a man I had never seen before. I couldn't believe my luck. The first night I was brave enough to leave my room I found my landlords wife having an affair! 

“Choke me John! Punish me! I've been a bad, bad girl!” She yelled. 

I laughed like I never laughed before but then quickly tried covering my mouth. I didn't want them to hear me. To my suprise, they didn't even react. Perhaps I couldn't be heard either! It made sense, my actual mouth and vocal chords where a floor below. This was exactly what I needed. Now I could have absolute proof that this whole experience was real and not in my head. Now I jad some dirt to test it. The last two weeks I kept questioning if it was real or not. Before I could do anything else, I felt myself get sucked through the floor, and then through a door, and back into my body. 

I Gasped for air. This was the longest and farthest I had ever gone. While catching my breath I repeated to myself “John, his name was John,”.

The next day I knocked on my landlords door when I knew she would be there. To my delight she opened the door. 

“Hey,” I said with a big smile.

“The fuck you want,” she said with annoyance.

“I need an extension on the rent. I'll have it for you guys next week,” I said with the same big smile.

“For fucks sake, aren’t you supposed to be the responsible one?” She angrily said.

“Sorry, I just had some shit happen recently and for the first time I'm gonna be a bit late with rent. It's not that big of a deal.” I said with the same goofy smile.

“So fucking irresponsible! Aren't you single with no kids?? Where does your money go?!” She angrily asked.

“No you don’t understand. John said it was ok,” I then said.

Her eyes widened at the mention of his name. I could tell reality sunk in for her when I mentioned his name. 

“I ..I don't know who that is,” she weakly replied.

I smiled an even greater smile. This was my confirmation. This whole astral projection was fucking real! 

“Look John said it was no problem. I'm just telling you instead of your husband because I know you are oser to John than him,” I said with a nasty smile. 

She couldn’t reply.

“Don't worry, we don't have any problem. Ill have the rent for you next week,” I said then added “ you bad girl,”.

Her eyes widened with fear. She must have thought in that moment I was a stalker or something, bit now I owned her.

“Ok,” she whispered “Next week is fine,”.

With that I turned around and went back to my apartment. Even though I was smiling, I was in shock. Now I had confirmation that this was all real. It wasn't in my head. AI was actually leaving my body and was free to go anywhere. At this very moment a whole new world had just opened up to me. There was no limit to what I could do with this ...”ability”. 


By now I was a pro. I could now leave my body and return whenever I wanted to. I would sometimes spend hours just walking around anywhere I wanted. It was amazing. In this world, I could go anywhere I wanted. I could even float above the ground and fly up anywhere. The laws of physics no longer applied in this world. That girl from the bar was right, this was life changing. I was able to enter anyone's home and watch them without them knowing I was there. During this time I learned a lot about the people in my life. Yousef, my deli guy, had a fetish for feet. I watched him in his house looking up women's feet on the internet, almost daily. The girl who worked at the coffee shop I went to every morning was a cutter. No wonder she always wore long sleeves. I know it's fucked up to invade people’s privacy but I was addicted.

I was having the time of my life. Then one day I got a little spooked. I was watching two women sitting outside a restaurant eating. I was in my spirit form, but for some reason I was drawn towards them. I stood right by them and tried to listen in on their conversation. They were just talking the usual nonsense, work, guys, nothing of interest. I was about to leave when one of them looked in my direction, and winked. I looked behind me to see no one there. 

“Theres no fucking way,” I thought to myself. 

I tried floating away back to my building, and she followed me with her eyes the whole time, with a smile on her face.

That girl scared me but she raised many questions. Why could she see me? Is she someone who can do the same thing? Would I also be able to see people with time? I didn't have any answers and I had no one to turn to for advice. I took a few days from astral projection, I was still pretty creeped out and thought it would be best for a break. 

I sat at home and decided to give Sal a call. I hadn't really hung out with him for a while, since I started my new...hobby. He didn't answer his phone. Not five minutes later I got a text from him. 

It read “ I know what you have been doing. You are playing in the devil's realm. God did not intend for us to be in that world. I can no longer see you while you do this. Please stop, it will not end well for you if you continue. I say this as someone who really cares about you, STOP,” 

I didn't know how to react to this. I tried calling him but got the voice message saying the number was no longer in service. My best friend, my only friend, had abandoned me. 


I went to work the next day. I wanted to talk to Sal. To my surprise he wasn't there. Our boss, Danny, told me Sal quit the day before. No two weeks, no nothing, just collected his stuff and left. 

“You didnt know?” Danny asked with surprise.

I just shook my head. 

“I don't know what's going on with him, he ignores all my texts and calls,” I replied.

But I didn know partially what was going on. Work was uneventful. I kept thinking about Sal the whole time. I went from sad to angry. My best friend turned his back on me for what?! I decided I would pay him a visit that night and see what he was up to. I would use my new ability to do a bit of reconnaissance work. 

I got home and quickly went to my bedroom. I closed the windows and doors to make it as quiet as possible, i was able to astral project with noise but it took me longer. It was easier to do it in silence.I closed my eyes tightly and focused. After a few moments I felt it, that weightlessness feeling. I opened my eyes and stood up. I looked at the floor and saw my body sitting still. 

“Time to go,” I said to myself with a smile.

It was a few days since I had done this, I forgot how much I loved this feeling, full freedom. I made my way to Sal's home. It took me about a half hour. I smiled as I almost arrived. A few weeks ago I would have been too weak to last this long, I would have been forced back into my body, and now look at me. 

“A master,” I thought. 

I saw Sal’s building. I made my way up the stairs. At this moment I forgot I could float up, gravity didn't affect me in this form. But I was still new to this. I arrived in front of his door. I felt a little guilt. I Was about to invade my best friends privacy, but I had to see him. I reached for the doorknob and as I did my hand once again went right through it. 

“Dumbass,” I said to myself. 

I walked right through the door. I didn't see him. I walked through his hallway looking for him. I knew he was somewhere in here. His lights were all on. I walked towards his bedroom. As I entered I saw him, on his knees, praying. I smiled.

“Must be getting ready for bed,” I thought to myself. 

But I realized that something was wrong He was praying, in another language. Latin perhaps? His hands were clenched tightly and he was rocking back and forth.He kept praying, and very intensely. One minute passed, then five minutes, then ten. I Was getting more and more worried. What was going on with my friend? I always knew he was religious, but this was...disturbing. 

“Sal what's wrong with you?!” I shouted desperately.

He kept on praying. I took my hand and foolishly tried to put it on his shoulder. It went right through him, but Sal suddenly jumped and let out a scream. I jumped back as well just as startled. 

Did he feel me? Sals eyes looked around the room frantically. 

“Whos...Whos there?!” He yelled out. 

“Sal, relax its just me!” I desperately shouted. 

He kept looking around the room, eyes wide in terror. He couldn't hear or see me. I tried desperately to calm him. I again reached for him, to help calm him. Again my hands just went right through him, but he jumped. His eyes widened even more with fear and he started running. 

It all happened in slow motion. He ran out of his bedroom into the living room, where he tripped over his desk chair. The same desk next to one of his windows, an open window. I saw him lose his balance and slowly fall right out of the window. I heard his loud scream of terror followed by a “crunch” sound, and then ...silence. I jumped out the window, I knew I couldn't get hurt in this state. Sals lifeless body greeted me on the street level. His arms and legs were bent in shapes that was not natural. His eyes, though opened, showed no life, but the same terror I saw in them right before he fell. I couldn’t move. People were now swarming his body from all over. Frantic voices were on their cell phones trying to call for help. I just stood there in shock, unable to look away from his lifeless eyes. 


Then out of nowhere, Sal slowly got up! He looked at me, and then to my horror, he looked down at his own mangled body. He gave me a sympathetic smile as he then started to ascend into the night sky. I tried to follow him. 

“Sal! Im so sorry! Wait!” I screamed out. I flew up after him, trying to catch up. I wanted to grab him to let him know this was an accident. I Didn't mean for him to die!
I was getting closer and closer, within inches of him, when he just disappeared before my eyes. I didn’t understand what happened, but I did know one thing. Sal was gone from this world 




I left the city after Sals death. I needed to take some time away from everything that had happened. I ended up going to my mother's house. She still lived with my sisters in a small town not far from the city I was in. It had been almost three years since I had last seen them all. My job kept me very busy. My family all heard about Sal. They all tried their best to be as comforting as possible. We had a big dinner the night I came back home. My sisters all shared their stories with me. My youngest sister was happy to soon start college. My Eldest sister, was excited for a new job she applied for in the city.

I told them about myself and my job. I of course left out my new “hobby”. That night was when everything changed for me. I was in my old room getting ready for bed after a nice dinner with my family. Before going to bed, I decided to go on another adventure. Once in my astral form I first went into my oldest  sisters room. I saw she was texting some guy, obviously someone she liked as she was making plans with him to go to the movies. 

“Boring!” I thought to myself.

Nothing interesting so I moved on. I moved on to my mothers room to find her sleeping. I smiled.

“Sweet dreams Mom,” I whispered softly.

I decided to leave the house, but as I left I was more nervous. Since Sal died, this world, the spirit world, astral world, whatever it was, seemed more grey than usual. The noise from the world, the people, the cars, all seemed to sound lighter than usual, the world seemed more dark than usual. I decided to make my way back home. Maybe everything seemed to change because I was spending a longer amount of time in this realm. I made my way to my mother's old house, through the front door, and then into the room I was spending the night. I saw my body, sitting there, crossed legs. I made my way over but to my horror I just went right through. It was the same if I tried to walk through a door or when I accidentally walked through someone in this form. I tried again and again and failed every time. My confusion then turned into panic. For the first time I was unable to return to my body! No matter how many times I tried, I was trapped outside my body!




I sat there for hours watching my own body. I didn't know what to do, I didn't know what was wrong. Should I just concentrate and visualize myself returning, the same way I would leave my body? Morning had arrived. I heard my family all getting up to start their day. I then froze in terror. I, no not me, my body got up! I just stared in fear and awe. I saw myself walk to the door and open it and walk down the hall. I quickly regained some composure and started to trail my own self. I hesitated, was that even me?

“ No there's no way!” I thought.

“Im me! Im here! I don't know what that...thing is!” I thought to myself.

I followed “it” to the kitchen. My mother was already there making breakfast for everyone. 

“Good morning!” She said cheerfully. “Did you sleep well?”

To my horror “it” replied, “ I slept great! Better than I have in a while!” with an evil smile. 

“NO MOM! THATS NOT ME! THATS NOT ME!” I yelled with desperation. 

She obviously couldn't hear me. 

I charged at my own body, trying to punch and kick, anything to stop the son of a bitch who was controlling my it.It was all for nothing, as every attempt went right through it. 

“I made some pancakes for you! I know how much you love them,” my mother said. 

It took a bite and then smiled that same nasty smile. 

“This is amazing! Best thing I've tasted in years!” It said.

My mother laughed.

“That's because you could never cook to save your own life!” She laughed.

Again I tried swinging my fist at it. I tried over and over, yelling “MOM PLEASE DONT LISTEN TO IT! THATS NOT ME!”

“GET OUT! GET OUT OF MY BODY! ILL FUCKING KILL YOU!” I shouted.

It was useless, it again had no affect. No one could feel me, no one could hear me, I was shut out. 

“Thanks for the pancakes!” It said and with an evil grin added “mom”. 

“I'm gonna head out for a bit,” it continued.

I started to cry. I had no power to do anything. All I could do was watch. 

“Alright dear, stay out of trouble!” My mother said.

“Always,” it replied.

It headed towards the door and I followed. Right before it stepped out it stopped and turned around to face….me. It let out an evil smile and said a simple 
“ thanks”.

 With that it stepped out into the world.



I had no choice but to follow it. I was determined to get my body back, some way, somehow. I knew my best bet was to just stay with it and try to learn all I could. It just walked around what seemed like randomly. It stopped at a starbucks and ordered a drink. Then it moved on to a deli and tried a little of every candy in sight. It stopped at almost every shop of every street. Eventually we reached a library. I saw it pick up the pace and move towards it. It had logged onto a computer and stayed there for hours. It was looking up the events of the last 80 years or so. From wars to politicians. I horrifying realized what it was doing, it was getting itself up to date on all the events it must have missed! 

I couldnt help myself, I yelled at it again “what the fuck do you want from me!!” 

It ignored me. I knew it was aware of my presence, how else did it know to give me that sadistic smile earlier. Hours turned into days. I just followed it, with no power to stop it. It tried everything, museums, restaurants, even concerts. It was making up for lost time. 

My world was turning more and more grey with each day I was in the spirit world.It got to the point where even noise died down. I could still hear the outside world if I focused enough on an object. But I knew it was only a matter of time before the world would go silent. I kept following it, as the world faded more and more I made sure to put all my focus on my body and whatever took over it. 

One day it looked at me. I froze, it always ignored me,what now? 

“It will only get worse. Soon all you will see is an abandoned city and an abandoned world. The people, the moving cars, all will soon disappear, you will be cursed to walk forever alone and unable to die,” it said. 

I didn't bother responding, I knew there was no point. 

“I am sorry but I was trapped there for so long, but then I saw you. I've been watching you and following you, waiting for the perfect moment to try and take over,” it continued. 

“Unless I leave you will never be able to return to your body. And I'm sorry to say I don't ever plan on returning to that world. I suffered enough in that...purgatory,” it said.

“Soon even I will disappear from your sight, no matter how hard you try to focus,” 

It smiled.

“Ive been there, I know, all I can tell you is look to the light if you wish to return,”

And with that he walked away. I knew it was useless to follow. I accepted my fate and accepted the fact that my body was lost to me. This darkening world was no my new reality.




I didnt know how long it had been now, weeks, months. I was in what seemed like purgatory, and all alone. I was still free to go anywhere I wanted, but there was nothing left to see. It was just like that thing said, nothing but deserted buildings and darkness. I was still alone. The world I saw was dark and cold. Cold...what I would give to actually feel cold again. I couldn't feel anything anymore. I couldn't hear anything or smell. At one point I did feel despair, but now ...now I feel absolutely nothing. I just wandered aimlessly. I had no choice. I couldnt ask for hell, I couldnt kill myself, all I could do was wander. 

Then one day it happened. A small light in the distance. I moved as fast as possible. I remembered what that thing said, “look to the light,”. As I got closer I saw the light was coming from one of the buildings. I moved faster towards it and through the last remaining door that separated me from that light. As soon as I walked in I saw that same light being sucked back, into a body! I was in shock. I could still see them, even though they were dark I could still see that person. The first person in god knows how long!

Im that very moment it all made sense to me. This was that persons first time astral projecting! Just like my first time, I didn't last long before being forced back into my body. This must have been how that thing found me! When you enter this world you must become visible to all who were here! 

With my new “enlightenment” I had gotten a new idea. An evil, but necessary, idea. If I followed his man long enough, if I waited for him to get stronger and be able to abandon his body long enough, perhaps I could use that as my chance to finally return to the real world. I could finally leave this place and be free! 

I tell you this story as a cautionary tale. Don’t try new things that you don't fully understand. This universe is larger and more grand than anyone could imagine and it’s secrets are...limitless. When you talk to your loved ones, be it your mother or father, your husband or wife, your son or daughter, be cautious. They may not be who they seem.

I need advice and this may be the place for it. I'm currently in the market for an executive desk that can ""hide"" an ATX sized case, with proper airflow. There are clients that I meet with, but on nights and weekends I game there, too. So realistically the desk must accommodate business appearance and gaming pc effectiveness. It's worth noting, that it must be similar to an executive desk where the monitors face a wall, due to security and compliance restrictions.  
I'll even send a tip or buy a coffee to the redditor that leads me to the desk I purchase.
Thank you, all! ",1,1728530062.0,desksetup,1,1.0,False
1g09m2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1g09m2p/im_trapped_outside_my_own_body/,I’m Trapped Outside My Own Body,"“You need a hobby,” said Sal.

He saw me eyeing the girl at the end of the bar.

“I got a hobby,” I laughed, still watching her.

“I meant something besides...well you know,” he replied. 

“Maybe a hobby with more meaning, something you find interesting,” he continued. 

“What? My current hobby isn't interesting enough?” I asked.

“Obviously not, if it was enough, I wouldn't have to have to hear you bitch every night about how much your life sucks,” Sal replied.

“Fuck off Sal,” I replied, unable to hide my annoyance.

Sal and I worked together, a simple office job. The pay was good and hours were a simple nine to five. Once we got out of work for the day we always went to the same bar for a few drinks. Life wasn’t bad...it was just so fucking boring. Every year that fled us, I got more and more depressed. Is this all I am ever going to do?  For the rest of my life? 

Sal and I always talked about this, usually started by me. For some reason he never had the same fear as me. Though he understood my frustration in life, he was still so content with his. It drove me mad. How the fuck was he so content with everything? We were both single, never married, never had any kids. Hell we both never even left our city, let alone state. We both followed the same path in life. Graduated high school, went to college, and then got a “good” but boring ass job. Our parents must have been so…”proud”.

“It sucks man. I feel like a goddamn goldfish, swimming in circles until it's time to be flushed down the toilet,” I said. 

“Come on, it's not so bad,” Sal replied. “We got a comfortable living,” he finished.

Sal always tried to be the voice of reason. 

“Thats the fucking problem! It’s comfortable. Comfortable usually means boring,” I said.

“Take a vacation then,”

“That’s only temporary,”.

“Go back to school and get a new degree”

“Takes too much time and money”.

“Oh for fucks sake! Sell drugs and become a kingpin then! Like ‘Breaking Bad’!” Sal finally said in exasperation. 

“Hmmm maybe I should!” I replied, trying to sound sarcastic.

Sal didn't know if I was joking or not.

“That was sarcasm,” I mocked.

At that moment, I noticed the girl get up and start walking towards us. My heart jumped a bit in excitement. I opened my mouth to say something, but she quickly cut me off.

“I'm not here for that,” she quickly said. 
My smile disappeared. 

“Oh my god, shut down!” Sal laughed.

“Shut the fuck up Sal, ” I frustratedly said. 

“What can we do for you then?” I asked her.
 
“I didn't mean to, but I couldn't help overhearing what you guys were talking about. Your friend is right you need a hobby,” she said.

“Wow what great insight! My problems are fucking solved!” I said, my tone dripping with sarcasm.

“Let me finish, asshole. I was in a similar situation as you. I tried a lot of crazy shit to bring some excitement to my life. Nothing worked until I tried one thig that changed my life forever,” she said

“What...what did you do?” Sal asked in a quiet and nervous tone.

She smiled.

“Tell me, what do you guys know about astral projection?”




I started laughing. I was never a religious or spiritual person, so that was my first instinct. 

“What is that, like meditation?” I asked.
She smiled.

“It’s...a method. A way for your spirit to temporarily leave your body,” she answered.

Sal looked very uncomfortable. He was always a religious man who took his faith seriously. 

“That sounds like the work of the devil. Your soul is only supposed to leave your body when you die,” he quietly said.

She turned to him.

“Maybe this has nothing to do with god or the devil. We, humans, are spiritual beings in a universe we know nothing about. This is just a way to possibly help us gain some new insight on life,” she replied to him.

Sal didn't reply. He just stared at her with the same nervous look. 

I laughed again. 

“You guys are both hilarious arguing over different fairy tales. Tell you what, if I ever drop acid or some other crazy drug Ill try your little astral projection. It should be fun in that state of mind,” I said with another inconsiderate laugh.

“Look you're the one complaing about life. Im just offering you something to try. You don't have to believe in it, but there's no harm in trying something new, especially in your state of mind,” she said.

“You boys enjoy your night,” she said and turned to leave.

“Wait what's your name?” I asked her.

“It doesn't matter, we won't see each other again,” she cooly replied. 

And with that she was gone. Sal looked more relaxed now that she left.

“Look I know your not a believer but no matter what, do not listen to her. Her idea is...dangerous,” Sal suddenly said.

“Whatever Sal, you know I think both of you are full of shit,” I replied.

“Good,” he simply said.

I lied. It's true I didn't believe either of them, but part of me was interested. I always prided myself on being as logical as possible. It's why I called myself an agnostic. Sure I didn’t believe in a god, or gods for that matter, but I admit I was to stupid to say they don't exist either. I wasn’t arrogant, just because I didn't believe in anything outside this life, that doesn’t mean there isn't anything out there. I hated to admit it, but this whole “astral projection” did peek my intrest. 

When I arrived home I went online and read all I could about it. It was like she said. Astral Projection was a way for your spirit or soul to leave your body for a time. All sources said something different about where your soul goes. Some say you just remain in this world but can go anywhere you choose. Others said you move into the world of purgatory. Another source said you enter another dimension and can see the true nature of the universe.

“What a bunch of bull. What the fuck am I doing?” I scolded myself. 

I turned off the computer and went to bed, I had work early the next day. All night I tossed and turned. I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about the girl from the bar and what she said. The worst thought entered my head and that was the “What if?”. 

What if she was right? What if against all my beliefs, there was something else out there? What if this was what I had been searching for? What...fucking...if?
I decided right then and there that if I was right and it was all bull I had nothing to lose. I decided that night that I would give this “astral projection” a try,



I took the next week to do as much research as possible, Before I even attempted anything, I wanted to have as much information at my disposal. I learned how astral projection was not just simple meditation, but also that you had to visualize yourself leaving your own body. Just like meditation, I had to be at complete peace with myself, no thoughts in your head aside from your goal. I tried for weeks, for hours everyday, all for nothing. I was starting to get fed up, 

“This is some bullshit, what am I doing?” I yelled at myself. I was ready to give up, but then I remembered what I read online. 

“You must be patient and at complete peace,” it said.

I took a deep breath and closed my eyes. I forced myself to clear my mind of everything. My job, my parents, my life, my reasons for doing this, every thought was shut out from my head. For the first time in my life I had no thoughts. For the first time, I found peace. 

I thought about my goal. I tried hard to visualize myself leaving my body. I focused on what felt like hours, when I suddenly realized something. I wasn’t breathing! With that realization I opened my eyes in panic when and couldn’t believe what I saw. My panic was replaced by astonishment. I was looking at….myself. 

I could see myself sitting with crossed legs, in the middle of my room. I was hovering a few feet from my body and the floor. I wasn’t breathing but I could see my body was. I could see my physical forms chest inhaling and exhaling calmly. While I stared in disbelief, all of a sudden I felt a force start pulling me back into my body. I couldn't fight it! It was over within a few seconds. I opened my eyes and gasped for breath. My heart was racing. I looked around the room and then at my own hands. I felt myself calm a bit and collapsed on the floor. I laughed. I couldn’t believe it. I actually had done it for a brief while! I successfully left my own body! 

It's been two weeks since the first time I left my body. I was getting better at it. I was able to last longer outside my body. It started off just a few seconds, but now I could remain out for over an hour before I was forced back into my body. Whatever “it” was, it felt like a muscle. The more I used it, the stronger it got. 
One night I was brave enough to finally leave the room my body was in. I Worked my way towards my door and tried to open it. My band went right through! 

“I wonder,” I thought to myself.

I tried to walk through the door and to my amazement it worked! I found myself in the small hallway outside my room. I was like a ghost! I could go through anything because I was not in a physical form. At that moment I had an idea. 

“I wonder what my landlord's wife is up to right now,” I said to myself. 

They lived directly above me. It was only midday and I knew that he wasn't home. Instead of taking the stairs I had another idea. In this form, if i can move through doors and walls, I Should be able to move through ceilings as well! I concentrated as hard as I could and found myself slowly floating off my floor, and straight through the ceiling. 

I found myself in their kitchen. It was such an average looking kitchen. You wouldn't think that they were owners of any property. My landlord was an asshole. He always tried to act like he was rich, flashy cars, flashy dress wear. Yet his kitchen was so...plain. I laughed. It was all a show for other people.  I made my way through the kitchen and through his apartment. His living room was just as dull. A tv, a couch, a plant or two lying around, but nothing else. No pictures, no paintings, nothing. I kept moving until I saw a closed door.

“Must be the bedroom,” I thought to myself.

I tried using the knob only for my hand once again, to go through it. 

“Of course,” I laughed to myself. I still had to get used to being in this form. I walked through the closed door only to be paralyzed with a pleasant shock. Here was my landlord's wife, with a man I had never seen before. I couldn't believe my luck. The first night I was brave enough to leave my room I found my landlords wife having an affair! 

“Choke me John! Punish me! I've been a bad, bad girl!” She yelled. 

I laughed like I never laughed before but then quickly tried covering my mouth. I didn't want them to hear me. To my suprise, they didn't even react. Perhaps I couldn't be heard either! It made sense, my actual mouth and vocal chords where a floor below. This was exactly what I needed. Now I could have absolute proof that this whole experience was real and not in my head. Now I jad some dirt to test it. The last two weeks I kept questioning if it was real or not. Before I could do anything else, I felt myself get sucked through the floor, and then through a door, and back into my body. 

I Gasped for air. This was the longest and farthest I had ever gone. While catching my breath I repeated to myself “John, his name was John,”.

The next day I knocked on my landlords door when I knew she would be there. To my delight she opened the door. 

“Hey,” I said with a big smile.

“The fuck you want,” she said with annoyance.

“I need an extension on the rent. I'll have it for you guys next week,” I said with the same big smile.

“For fucks sake, aren’t you supposed to be the responsible one?” She angrily said.

“Sorry, I just had some shit happen recently and for the first time I'm gonna be a bit late with rent. It's not that big of a deal.” I said with the same goofy smile.

“So fucking irresponsible! Aren't you single with no kids?? Where does your money go?!” She angrily asked.

“No you don’t understand. John said it was ok,” I then said.

Her eyes widened at the mention of his name. I could tell reality sunk in for her when I mentioned his name. 

“I ..I don't know who that is,” she weakly replied.

I smiled an even greater smile. This was my confirmation. This whole astral projection was fucking real! 

“Look John said it was no problem. I'm just telling you instead of your husband because I know you are oser to John than him,” I said with a nasty smile. 

She couldn’t reply.

“Don't worry, we don't have any problem. Ill have the rent for you next week,” I said then added “ you bad girl,”.

Her eyes widened with fear. She must have thought in that moment I was a stalker or something, bit now I owned her.

“Ok,” she whispered “Next week is fine,”.

With that I turned around and went back to my apartment. Even though I was smiling, I was in shock. Now I had confirmation that this was all real. It wasn't in my head. AI was actually leaving my body and was free to go anywhere. At this very moment a whole new world had just opened up to me. There was no limit to what I could do with this ...”ability”. 


By now I was a pro. I could now leave my body and return whenever I wanted to. I would sometimes spend hours just walking around anywhere I wanted. It was amazing. In this world, I could go anywhere I wanted. I could even float above the ground and fly up anywhere. The laws of physics no longer applied in this world. That girl from the bar was right, this was life changing. I was able to enter anyone's home and watch them without them knowing I was there. During this time I learned a lot about the people in my life. Yousef, my deli guy, had a fetish for feet. I watched him in his house looking up women's feet on the internet, almost daily. The girl who worked at the coffee shop I went to every morning was a cutter. No wonder she always wore long sleeves. I know it's fucked up to invade people’s privacy but I was addicted.

I was having the time of my life. Then one day I got a little spooked. I was watching two women sitting outside a restaurant eating. I was in my spirit form, but for some reason I was drawn towards them. I stood right by them and tried to listen in on their conversation. They were just talking the usual nonsense, work, guys, nothing of interest. I was about to leave when one of them looked in my direction, and winked. I looked behind me to see no one there. 

“Theres no fucking way,” I thought to myself. 

I tried floating away back to my building, and she followed me with her eyes the whole time, with a smile on her face.

That girl scared me but she raised many questions. Why could she see me? Is she someone who can do the same thing? Would I also be able to see people with time? I didn't have any answers and I had no one to turn to for advice. I took a few days from astral projection, I was still pretty creeped out and thought it would be best for a break. 

I sat at home and decided to give Sal a call. I hadn't really hung out with him for a while, since I started my new...hobby. He didn't answer his phone. Not five minutes later I got a text from him. 

It read “ I know what you have been doing. You are playing in the devil's realm. God did not intend for us to be in that world. I can no longer see you while you do this. Please stop, it will not end well for you if you continue. I say this as someone who really cares about you, STOP,” 

I didn't know how to react to this. I tried calling him but got the voice message saying the number was no longer in service. My best friend, my only friend, had abandoned me. 


I went to work the next day. I wanted to talk to Sal. To my surprise he wasn't there. Our boss, Danny, told me Sal quit the day before. No two weeks, no nothing, just collected his stuff and left. 

“You didnt know?” Danny asked with surprise.

I just shook my head. 

“I don't know what's going on with him, he ignores all my texts and calls,” I replied.

But I didn know partially what was going on. Work was uneventful. I kept thinking about Sal the whole time. I went from sad to angry. My best friend turned his back on me for what?! I decided I would pay him a visit that night and see what he was up to. I would use my new ability to do a bit of reconnaissance work. 

I got home and quickly went to my bedroom. I closed the windows and doors to make it as quiet as possible, i was able to astral project with noise but it took me longer. It was easier to do it in silence.I closed my eyes tightly and focused. After a few moments I felt it, that weightlessness feeling. I opened my eyes and stood up. I looked at the floor and saw my body sitting still. 

“Time to go,” I said to myself with a smile.

It was a few days since I had done this, I forgot how much I loved this feeling, full freedom. I made my way to Sal's home. It took me about a half hour. I smiled as I almost arrived. A few weeks ago I would have been too weak to last this long, I would have been forced back into my body, and now look at me. 

“A master,” I thought. 

I saw Sal’s building. I made my way up the stairs. At this moment I forgot I could float up, gravity didn't affect me in this form. But I was still new to this. I arrived in front of his door. I felt a little guilt. I Was about to invade my best friends privacy, but I had to see him. I reached for the doorknob and as I did my hand once again went right through it. 

“Dumbass,” I said to myself. 

I walked right through the door. I didn't see him. I walked through his hallway looking for him. I knew he was somewhere in here. His lights were all on. I walked towards his bedroom. As I entered I saw him, on his knees, praying. I smiled.

“Must be getting ready for bed,” I thought to myself. 

But I realized that something was wrong He was praying, in another language. Latin perhaps? His hands were clenched tightly and he was rocking back and forth.He kept praying, and very intensely. One minute passed, then five minutes, then ten. I Was getting more and more worried. What was going on with my friend? I always knew he was religious, but this was...disturbing. 

“Sal what's wrong with you?!” I shouted desperately.

He kept on praying. I took my hand and foolishly tried to put it on his shoulder. It went right through him, but Sal suddenly jumped and let out a scream. I jumped back as well just as startled. 

Did he feel me? Sals eyes looked around the room frantically. 

“Whos...Whos there?!” He yelled out. 

“Sal, relax its just me!” I desperately shouted. 

He kept looking around the room, eyes wide in terror. He couldn't hear or see me. I tried desperately to calm him. I again reached for him, to help calm him. Again my hands just went right through him, but he jumped. His eyes widened even more with fear and he started running. 

It all happened in slow motion. He ran out of his bedroom into the living room, where he tripped over his desk chair. The same desk next to one of his windows, an open window. I saw him lose his balance and slowly fall right out of the window. I heard his loud scream of terror followed by a “crunch” sound, and then ...silence. I jumped out the window, I knew I couldn't get hurt in this state. Sals lifeless body greeted me on the street level. His arms and legs were bent in shapes that was not natural. His eyes, though opened, showed no life, but the same terror I saw in them right before he fell. I couldn’t move. People were now swarming his body from all over. Frantic voices were on their cell phones trying to call for help. I just stood there in shock, unable to look away from his lifeless eyes. 


Then out of nowhere, Sal slowly got up! He looked at me, and then to my horror, he looked down at his own mangled body. He gave me a sympathetic smile as he then started to ascend into the night sky. I tried to follow him. 

“Sal! Im so sorry! Wait!” I screamed out. I flew up after him, trying to catch up. I wanted to grab him to let him know this was an accident. I Didn't mean for him to die!
I was getting closer and closer, within inches of him, when he just disappeared before my eyes. I didn’t understand what happened, but I did know one thing. Sal was gone from this world 




I left the city after Sals death. I needed to take some time away from everything that had happened. I ended up going to my mother's house. She still lived with my sisters in a small town not far from the city I was in. It had been almost three years since I had last seen them all. My job kept me very busy. My family all heard about Sal. They all tried their best to be as comforting as possible. We had a big dinner the night I came back home. My sisters all shared their stories with me. My youngest sister was happy to soon start college. My Eldest sister, was excited for a new job she applied for in the city.

I told them about myself and my job. I of course left out my new “hobby”. That night was when everything changed for me. I was in my old room getting ready for bed after a nice dinner with my family. Before going to bed, I decided to go on another adventure. Once in my astral form I first went into my oldest  sisters room. I saw she was texting some guy, obviously someone she liked as she was making plans with him to go to the movies. 

“Boring!” I thought to myself.

Nothing interesting so I moved on. I moved on to my mothers room to find her sleeping. I smiled.

“Sweet dreams Mom,” I whispered softly.

I decided to leave the house, but as I left I was more nervous. Since Sal died, this world, the spirit world, astral world, whatever it was, seemed more grey than usual. The noise from the world, the people, the cars, all seemed to sound lighter than usual, the world seemed more dark than usual. I decided to make my way back home. Maybe everything seemed to change because I was spending a longer amount of time in this realm. I made my way to my mother's old house, through the front door, and then into the room I was spending the night. I saw my body, sitting there, crossed legs. I made my way over but to my horror I just went right through. It was the same if I tried to walk through a door or when I accidentally walked through someone in this form. I tried again and again and failed every time. My confusion then turned into panic. For the first time I was unable to return to my body! No matter how many times I tried, I was trapped outside my body!




I sat there for hours watching my own body. I didn't know what to do, I didn't know what was wrong. Should I just concentrate and visualize myself returning, the same way I would leave my body? Morning had arrived. I heard my family all getting up to start their day. I then froze in terror. I, no not me, my body got up! I just stared in fear and awe. I saw myself walk to the door and open it and walk down the hall. I quickly regained some composure and started to trail my own self. I hesitated, was that even me?

“ No there's no way!” I thought.

“Im me! Im here! I don't know what that...thing is!” I thought to myself.

I followed “it” to the kitchen. My mother was already there making breakfast for everyone. 

“Good morning!” She said cheerfully. “Did you sleep well?”

To my horror “it” replied, “ I slept great! Better than I have in a while!” with an evil smile. 

“NO MOM! THATS NOT ME! THATS NOT ME!” I yelled with desperation. 

She obviously couldn't hear me. 

I charged at my own body, trying to punch and kick, anything to stop the son of a bitch who was controlling my it.It was all for nothing, as every attempt went right through it. 

“I made some pancakes for you! I know how much you love them,” my mother said. 

It took a bite and then smiled that same nasty smile. 

“This is amazing! Best thing I've tasted in years!” It said.

My mother laughed.

“That's because you could never cook to save your own life!” She laughed.

Again I tried swinging my fist at it. I tried over and over, yelling “MOM PLEASE DONT LISTEN TO IT! THATS NOT ME!”

“GET OUT! GET OUT OF MY BODY! ILL FUCKING KILL YOU!” I shouted.

It was useless, it again had no affect. No one could feel me, no one could hear me, I was shut out. 

“Thanks for the pancakes!” It said and with an evil grin added “mom”. 

“I'm gonna head out for a bit,” it continued.

I started to cry. I had no power to do anything. All I could do was watch. 

“Alright dear, stay out of trouble!” My mother said.

“Always,” it replied.

It headed towards the door and I followed. Right before it stepped out it stopped and turned around to face….me. It let out an evil smile and said a simple 
“ thanks”.

 With that it stepped out into the world.



I had no choice but to follow it. I was determined to get my body back, some way, somehow. I knew my best bet was to just stay with it and try to learn all I could. It just walked around what seemed like randomly. It stopped at a starbucks and ordered a drink. Then it moved on to a deli and tried a little of every candy in sight. It stopped at almost every shop of every street. Eventually we reached a library. I saw it pick up the pace and move towards it. It had logged onto a computer and stayed there for hours. It was looking up the events of the last 80 years or so. From wars to politicians. I horrifying realized what it was doing, it was getting itself up to date on all the events it must have missed! 

I couldnt help myself, I yelled at it again “what the fuck do you want from me!!” 

It ignored me. I knew it was aware of my presence, how else did it know to give me that sadistic smile earlier. Hours turned into days. I just followed it, with no power to stop it. It tried everything, museums, restaurants, even concerts. It was making up for lost time. 

My world was turning more and more grey with each day I was in the spirit world.It got to the point where even noise died down. I could still hear the outside world if I focused enough on an object. But I knew it was only a matter of time before the world would go silent. I kept following it, as the world faded more and more I made sure to put all my focus on my body and whatever took over it. 

One day it looked at me. I froze, it always ignored me,what now? 

“It will only get worse. Soon all you will see is an abandoned city and an abandoned world. The people, the moving cars, all will soon disappear, you will be cursed to walk forever alone and unable to die,” it said. 

I didn't bother responding, I knew there was no point. 

“I am sorry but I was trapped there for so long, but then I saw you. I've been watching you and following you, waiting for the perfect moment to try and take over,” it continued. 

“Unless I leave you will never be able to return to your body. And I'm sorry to say I don't ever plan on returning to that world. I suffered enough in that...purgatory,” it said.

“Soon even I will disappear from your sight, no matter how hard you try to focus,” 

It smiled.

“Ive been there, I know, all I can tell you is look to the light if you wish to return,”

And with that he walked away. I knew it was useless to follow. I accepted my fate and accepted the fact that my body was lost to me. This darkening world was no my new reality.




I didnt know how long it had been now, weeks, months. I was in what seemed like purgatory, and all alone. I was still free to go anywhere I wanted, but there was nothing left to see. It was just like that thing said, nothing but deserted buildings and darkness. I was still alone. The world I saw was dark and cold. Cold...what I would give to actually feel cold again. I couldn't feel anything anymore. I couldn't hear anything or smell. At one point I did feel despair, but now ...now I feel absolutely nothing. I just wandered aimlessly. I had no choice. I couldnt ask for hell, I couldnt kill myself, all I could do was wander. 

Then one day it happened. A small light in the distance. I moved as fast as possible. I remembered what that thing said, “look to the light,”. As I got closer I saw the light was coming from one of the buildings. I moved faster towards it and through the last remaining door that separated me from that light. As soon as I walked in I saw that same light being sucked back, into a body! I was in shock. I could still see them, even though they were dark I could still see that person. The first person in god knows how long!

Im that very moment it all made sense to me. This was that persons first time astral projecting! Just like my first time, I didn't last long before being forced back into my body. This must have been how that thing found me! When you enter this world you must become visible to all who were here! 

With my new “enlightenment” I had gotten a new idea. An evil, but necessary, idea. If I followed his man long enough, if I waited for him to get stronger and be able to abandon his body long enough, perhaps I could use that as my chance to finally return to the real world. I could finally leave this place and be free! 

I tell you this story as a cautionary tale. Don’t try new things that you don't fully understand. This universe is larger and more grand than anyone could imagine and it’s secrets are...limitless. When you talk to your loved ones, be it your mother or father, your husband or wife, your son or daughter, be cautious. They may not be who they seem.

He saw me eyeing the girl at the end of the bar.

“I got a hobby,” I laughed, still watching her.

“I meant something besides...well you know,” he replied. 

“Maybe a hobby with more meaning, something you find interesting,” he continued. 

“What? My current hobby isn't interesting enough?” I asked.

“Obviously not, if it was enough, I wouldn't have to have to hear you bitch every night about how much your life sucks,” Sal replied.

“Fuck off Sal,” I replied, unable to hide my annoyance.

Sal and I worked together, a simple office job. The pay was good and hours were a simple nine to five. Once we got out of work for the day we always went to the same bar for a few drinks. Life wasn’t bad...it was just so fucking boring. Every year that fled us, I got more and more depressed. Is this all I am ever going to do?  For the rest of my life? 

Sal and I always talked about this, usually started by me. For some reason he never had the same fear as me. Though he understood my frustration in life, he was still so content with his. It drove me mad. How the fuck was he so content with everything? We were both single, never married, never had any kids. Hell we both never even left our city, let alone state. We both followed the same path in life. Graduated high school, went to college, and then got a “good” but boring ass job. Our parents must have been so…”proud”.

“It sucks man. I feel like a goddamn goldfish, swimming in circles until it's time to be flushed down the toilet,” I said. 

“Come on, it's not so bad,” Sal replied. “We got a comfortable living,” he finished.

Sal always tried to be the voice of reason. 

“Thats the fucking problem! It’s comfortable. Comfortable usually means boring,” I said.

“Take a vacation then,”

“That’s only temporary,”.

“Go back to school and get a new degree”

“Takes too much time and money”.

“Oh for fucks sake! Sell drugs and become a kingpin then! Like ‘Breaking Bad’!” Sal finally said in exasperation. 

“Hmmm maybe I should!” I replied, trying to sound sarcastic.

Sal didn't know if I was joking or not.

“That was sarcasm,” I mocked.

At that moment, I noticed the girl get up and start walking towards us. My heart jumped a bit in excitement. I opened my mouth to say something, but she quickly cut me off.

“I'm not here for that,” she quickly said. 
My smile disappeared. 

“Oh my god, shut down!” Sal laughed.

“Shut the fuck up Sal, ” I frustratedly said. 

“What can we do for you then?” I asked her.
 
“I didn't mean to, but I couldn't help overhearing what you guys were talking about. Your friend is right you need a hobby,” she said.

“Wow what great insight! My problems are fucking solved!” I said, my tone dripping with sarcasm.

“Let me finish, asshole. I was in a similar situation as you. I tried a lot of crazy shit to bring some excitement to my life. Nothing worked until I tried one thig that changed my life forever,” she said

“What...what did you do?” Sal asked in a quiet and nervous tone.

She smiled.

“Tell me, what do you guys know about astral projection?”




I started laughing. I was never a religious or spiritual person, so that was my first instinct. 

“What is that, like meditation?” I asked.
She smiled.

“It’s...a method. A way for your spirit to temporarily leave your body,” she answered.

Sal looked very uncomfortable. He was always a religious man who took his faith seriously. 

“That sounds like the work of the devil. Your soul is only supposed to leave your body when you die,” he quietly said.

She turned to him.

“Maybe this has nothing to do with god or the devil. We, humans, are spiritual beings in a universe we know nothing about. This is just a way to possibly help us gain some new insight on life,” she replied to him.

Sal didn't reply. He just stared at her with the same nervous look. 

I laughed again. 

“You guys are both hilarious arguing over different fairy tales. Tell you what, if I ever drop acid or some other crazy drug Ill try your little astral projection. It should be fun in that state of mind,” I said with another inconsiderate laugh.

“Look you're the one complaing about life. Im just offering you something to try. You don't have to believe in it, but there's no harm in trying something new, especially in your state of mind,” she said.

“You boys enjoy your night,” she said and turned to leave.

“Wait what's your name?” I asked her.

“It doesn't matter, we won't see each other again,” she cooly replied. 

And with that she was gone. Sal looked more relaxed now that she left.

“Look I know your not a believer but no matter what, do not listen to her. Her idea is...dangerous,” Sal suddenly said.

“Whatever Sal, you know I think both of you are full of shit,” I replied.

“Good,” he simply said.

I lied. It's true I didn't believe either of them, but part of me was interested. I always prided myself on being as logical as possible. It's why I called myself an agnostic. Sure I didn’t believe in a god, or gods for that matter, but I admit I was to stupid to say they don't exist either. I wasn’t arrogant, just because I didn't believe in anything outside this life, that doesn’t mean there isn't anything out there. I hated to admit it, but this whole “astral projection” did peek my intrest. 

When I arrived home I went online and read all I could about it. It was like she said. Astral Projection was a way for your spirit or soul to leave your body for a time. All sources said something different about where your soul goes. Some say you just remain in this world but can go anywhere you choose. Others said you move into the world of purgatory. Another source said you enter another dimension and can see the true nature of the universe.

“What a bunch of bull. What the fuck am I doing?” I scolded myself. 

I turned off the computer and went to bed, I had work early the next day. All night I tossed and turned. I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about the girl from the bar and what she said. The worst thought entered my head and that was the “What if?”. 

What if she was right? What if against all my beliefs, there was something else out there? What if this was what I had been searching for? What...fucking...if?
I decided right then and there that if I was right and it was all bull I had nothing to lose. I decided that night that I would give this “astral projection” a try,



I took the next week to do as much research as possible, Before I even attempted anything, I wanted to have as much information at my disposal. I learned how astral projection was not just simple meditation, but also that you had to visualize yourself leaving your own body. Just like meditation, I had to be at complete peace with myself, no thoughts in your head aside from your goal. I tried for weeks, for hours everyday, all for nothing. I was starting to get fed up, 

“This is some bullshit, what am I doing?” I yelled at myself. I was ready to give up, but then I remembered what I read online. 

“You must be patient and at complete peace,” it said.

I took a deep breath and closed my eyes. I forced myself to clear my mind of everything. My job, my parents, my life, my reasons for doing this, every thought was shut out from my head. For the first time in my life I had no thoughts. For the first time, I found peace. 

I thought about my goal. I tried hard to visualize myself leaving my body. I focused on what felt like hours, when I suddenly realized something. I wasn’t breathing! With that realization I opened my eyes in panic when and couldn’t believe what I saw. My panic was replaced by astonishment. I was looking at….myself. 

I could see myself sitting with crossed legs, in the middle of my room. I was hovering a few feet from my body and the floor. I wasn’t breathing but I could see my body was. I could see my physical forms chest inhaling and exhaling calmly. While I stared in disbelief, all of a sudden I felt a force start pulling me back into my body. I couldn't fight it! It was over within a few seconds. I opened my eyes and gasped for breath. My heart was racing. I looked around the room and then at my own hands. I felt myself calm a bit and collapsed on the floor. I laughed. I couldn’t believe it. I actually had done it for a brief while! I successfully left my own body! 

It's been two weeks since the first time I left my body. I was getting better at it. I was able to last longer outside my body. It started off just a few seconds, but now I could remain out for over an hour before I was forced back into my body. Whatever “it” was, it felt like a muscle. The more I used it, the stronger it got. 
One night I was brave enough to finally leave the room my body was in. I Worked my way towards my door and tried to open it. My band went right through! 

“I wonder,” I thought to myself.

I tried to walk through the door and to my amazement it worked! I found myself in the small hallway outside my room. I was like a ghost! I could go through anything because I was not in a physical form. At that moment I had an idea. 

“I wonder what my landlord's wife is up to right now,” I said to myself. 

They lived directly above me. It was only midday and I knew that he wasn't home. Instead of taking the stairs I had another idea. In this form, if i can move through doors and walls, I Should be able to move through ceilings as well! I concentrated as hard as I could and found myself slowly floating off my floor, and straight through the ceiling. 

I found myself in their kitchen. It was such an average looking kitchen. You wouldn't think that they were owners of any property. My landlord was an asshole. He always tried to act like he was rich, flashy cars, flashy dress wear. Yet his kitchen was so...plain. I laughed. It was all a show for other people.  I made my way through the kitchen and through his apartment. His living room was just as dull. A tv, a couch, a plant or two lying around, but nothing else. No pictures, no paintings, nothing. I kept moving until I saw a closed door.

“Must be the bedroom,” I thought to myself.

I tried using the knob only for my hand once again, to go through it. 

“Of course,” I laughed to myself. I still had to get used to being in this form. I walked through the closed door only to be paralyzed with a pleasant shock. Here was my landlord's wife, with a man I had never seen before. I couldn't believe my luck. The first night I was brave enough to leave my room I found my landlords wife having an affair! 

“Choke me John! Punish me! I've been a bad, bad girl!” She yelled. 

I laughed like I never laughed before but then quickly tried covering my mouth. I didn't want them to hear me. To my suprise, they didn't even react. Perhaps I couldn't be heard either! It made sense, my actual mouth and vocal chords where a floor below. This was exactly what I needed. Now I could have absolute proof that this whole experience was real and not in my head. Now I jad some dirt to test it. The last two weeks I kept questioning if it was real or not. Before I could do anything else, I felt myself get sucked through the floor, and then through a door, and back into my body. 

I Gasped for air. This was the longest and farthest I had ever gone. While catching my breath I repeated to myself “John, his name was John,”.

The next day I knocked on my landlords door when I knew she would be there. To my delight she opened the door. 

“Hey,” I said with a big smile.

“The fuck you want,” she said with annoyance.

“I need an extension on the rent. I'll have it for you guys next week,” I said with the same big smile.

“For fucks sake, aren’t you supposed to be the responsible one?” She angrily said.

“Sorry, I just had some shit happen recently and for the first time I'm gonna be a bit late with rent. It's not that big of a deal.” I said with the same goofy smile.

“So fucking irresponsible! Aren't you single with no kids?? Where does your money go?!” She angrily asked.

“No you don’t understand. John said it was ok,” I then said.

Her eyes widened at the mention of his name. I could tell reality sunk in for her when I mentioned his name. 

“I ..I don't know who that is,” she weakly replied.

I smiled an even greater smile. This was my confirmation. This whole astral projection was fucking real! 

“Look John said it was no problem. I'm just telling you instead of your husband because I know you are oser to John than him,” I said with a nasty smile. 

She couldn’t reply.

“Don't worry, we don't have any problem. Ill have the rent for you next week,” I said then added “ you bad girl,”.

Her eyes widened with fear. She must have thought in that moment I was a stalker or something, bit now I owned her.

“Ok,” she whispered “Next week is fine,”.

With that I turned around and went back to my apartment. Even though I was smiling, I was in shock. Now I had confirmation that this was all real. It wasn't in my head. AI was actually leaving my body and was free to go anywhere. At this very moment a whole new world had just opened up to me. There was no limit to what I could do with this ...”ability”. 


By now I was a pro. I could now leave my body and return whenever I wanted to. I would sometimes spend hours just walking around anywhere I wanted. It was amazing. In this world, I could go anywhere I wanted. I could even float above the ground and fly up anywhere. The laws of physics no longer applied in this world. That girl from the bar was right, this was life changing. I was able to enter anyone's home and watch them without them knowing I was there. During this time I learned a lot about the people in my life. Yousef, my deli guy, had a fetish for feet. I watched him in his house looking up women's feet on the internet, almost daily. The girl who worked at the coffee shop I went to every morning was a cutter. No wonder she always wore long sleeves. I know it's fucked up to invade people’s privacy but I was addicted.

I was having the time of my life. Then one day I got a little spooked. I was watching two women sitting outside a restaurant eating. I was in my spirit form, but for some reason I was drawn towards them. I stood right by them and tried to listen in on their conversation. They were just talking the usual nonsense, work, guys, nothing of interest. I was about to leave when one of them looked in my direction, and winked. I looked behind me to see no one there. 

“Theres no fucking way,” I thought to myself. 

I tried floating away back to my building, and she followed me with her eyes the whole time, with a smile on her face.

That girl scared me but she raised many questions. Why could she see me? Is she someone who can do the same thing? Would I also be able to see people with time? I didn't have any answers and I had no one to turn to for advice. I took a few days from astral projection, I was still pretty creeped out and thought it would be best for a break. 

I sat at home and decided to give Sal a call. I hadn't really hung out with him for a while, since I started my new...hobby. He didn't answer his phone. Not five minutes later I got a text from him. 

It read “ I know what you have been doing. You are playing in the devil's realm. God did not intend for us to be in that world. I can no longer see you while you do this. Please stop, it will not end well for you if you continue. I say this as someone who really cares about you, STOP,” 

I didn't know how to react to this. I tried calling him but got the voice message saying the number was no longer in service. My best friend, my only friend, had abandoned me. 


I went to work the next day. I wanted to talk to Sal. To my surprise he wasn't there. Our boss, Danny, told me Sal quit the day before. No two weeks, no nothing, just collected his stuff and left. 

“You didnt know?” Danny asked with surprise.

I just shook my head. 

“I don't know what's going on with him, he ignores all my texts and calls,” I replied.

But I didn know partially what was going on. Work was uneventful. I kept thinking about Sal the whole time. I went from sad to angry. My best friend turned his back on me for what?! I decided I would pay him a visit that night and see what he was up to. I would use my new ability to do a bit of reconnaissance work. 

I got home and quickly went to my bedroom. I closed the windows and doors to make it as quiet as possible, i was able to astral project with noise but it took me longer. It was easier to do it in silence.I closed my eyes tightly and focused. After a few moments I felt it, that weightlessness feeling. I opened my eyes and stood up. I looked at the floor and saw my body sitting still. 

“Time to go,” I said to myself with a smile.

It was a few days since I had done this, I forgot how much I loved this feeling, full freedom. I made my way to Sal's home. It took me about a half hour. I smiled as I almost arrived. A few weeks ago I would have been too weak to last this long, I would have been forced back into my body, and now look at me. 

“A master,” I thought. 

I saw Sal’s building. I made my way up the stairs. At this moment I forgot I could float up, gravity didn't affect me in this form. But I was still new to this. I arrived in front of his door. I felt a little guilt. I Was about to invade my best friends privacy, but I had to see him. I reached for the doorknob and as I did my hand once again went right through it. 

“Dumbass,” I said to myself. 

I walked right through the door. I didn't see him. I walked through his hallway looking for him. I knew he was somewhere in here. His lights were all on. I walked towards his bedroom. As I entered I saw him, on his knees, praying. I smiled.

“Must be getting ready for bed,” I thought to myself. 

But I realized that something was wrong He was praying, in another language. Latin perhaps? His hands were clenched tightly and he was rocking back and forth.He kept praying, and very intensely. One minute passed, then five minutes, then ten. I Was getting more and more worried. What was going on with my friend? I always knew he was religious, but this was...disturbing. 

“Sal what's wrong with you?!” I shouted desperately.

He kept on praying. I took my hand and foolishly tried to put it on his shoulder. It went right through him, but Sal suddenly jumped and let out a scream. I jumped back as well just as startled. 

Did he feel me? Sals eyes looked around the room frantically. 

“Whos...Whos there?!” He yelled out. 

“Sal, relax its just me!” I desperately shouted. 

He kept looking around the room, eyes wide in terror. He couldn't hear or see me. I tried desperately to calm him. I again reached for him, to help calm him. Again my hands just went right through him, but he jumped. His eyes widened even more with fear and he started running. 

It all happened in slow motion. He ran out of his bedroom into the living room, where he tripped over his desk chair. The same desk next to one of his windows, an open window. I saw him lose his balance and slowly fall right out of the window. I heard his loud scream of terror followed by a “crunch” sound, and then ...silence. I jumped out the window, I knew I couldn't get hurt in this state. Sals lifeless body greeted me on the street level. His arms and legs were bent in shapes that was not natural. His eyes, though opened, showed no life, but the same terror I saw in them right before he fell. I couldn’t move. People were now swarming his body from all over. Frantic voices were on their cell phones trying to call for help. I just stood there in shock, unable to look away from his lifeless eyes. 


Then out of nowhere, Sal slowly got up! He looked at me, and then to my horror, he looked down at his own mangled body. He gave me a sympathetic smile as he then started to ascend into the night sky. I tried to follow him. 

“Sal! Im so sorry! Wait!” I screamed out. I flew up after him, trying to catch up. I wanted to grab him to let him know this was an accident. I Didn't mean for him to die!
I was getting closer and closer, within inches of him, when he just disappeared before my eyes. I didn’t understand what happened, but I did know one thing. Sal was gone from this world 




I left the city after Sals death. I needed to take some time away from everything that had happened. I ended up going to my mother's house. She still lived with my sisters in a small town not far from the city I was in. It had been almost three years since I had last seen them all. My job kept me very busy. My family all heard about Sal. They all tried their best to be as comforting as possible. We had a big dinner the night I came back home. My sisters all shared their stories with me. My youngest sister was happy to soon start college. My Eldest sister, was excited for a new job she applied for in the city.

I told them about myself and my job. I of course left out my new “hobby”. That night was when everything changed for me. I was in my old room getting ready for bed after a nice dinner with my family. Before going to bed, I decided to go on another adventure. Once in my astral form I first went into my oldest  sisters room. I saw she was texting some guy, obviously someone she liked as she was making plans with him to go to the movies. 

“Boring!” I thought to myself.

Nothing interesting so I moved on. I moved on to my mothers room to find her sleeping. I smiled.

“Sweet dreams Mom,” I whispered softly.

I decided to leave the house, but as I left I was more nervous. Since Sal died, this world, the spirit world, astral world, whatever it was, seemed more grey than usual. The noise from the world, the people, the cars, all seemed to sound lighter than usual, the world seemed more dark than usual. I decided to make my way back home. Maybe everything seemed to change because I was spending a longer amount of time in this realm. I made my way to my mother's old house, through the front door, and then into the room I was spending the night. I saw my body, sitting there, crossed legs. I made my way over but to my horror I just went right through. It was the same if I tried to walk through a door or when I accidentally walked through someone in this form. I tried again and again and failed every time. My confusion then turned into panic. For the first time I was unable to return to my body! No matter how many times I tried, I was trapped outside my body!




I sat there for hours watching my own body. I didn't know what to do, I didn't know what was wrong. Should I just concentrate and visualize myself returning, the same way I would leave my body? Morning had arrived. I heard my family all getting up to start their day. I then froze in terror. I, no not me, my body got up! I just stared in fear and awe. I saw myself walk to the door and open it and walk down the hall. I quickly regained some composure and started to trail my own self. I hesitated, was that even me?

“ No there's no way!” I thought.

“Im me! Im here! I don't know what that...thing is!” I thought to myself.

I followed “it” to the kitchen. My mother was already there making breakfast for everyone. 

“Good morning!” She said cheerfully. “Did you sleep well?”

To my horror “it” replied, “ I slept great! Better than I have in a while!” with an evil smile. 

“NO MOM! THATS NOT ME! THATS NOT ME!” I yelled with desperation. 

She obviously couldn't hear me. 

I charged at my own body, trying to punch and kick, anything to stop the son of a bitch who was controlling my it.It was all for nothing, as every attempt went right through it. 

“I made some pancakes for you! I know how much you love them,” my mother said. 

It took a bite and then smiled that same nasty smile. 

“This is amazing! Best thing I've tasted in years!” It said.

My mother laughed.

“That's because you could never cook to save your own life!” She laughed.

Again I tried swinging my fist at it. I tried over and over, yelling “MOM PLEASE DONT LISTEN TO IT! THATS NOT ME!”

“GET OUT! GET OUT OF MY BODY! ILL FUCKING KILL YOU!” I shouted.

It was useless, it again had no affect. No one could feel me, no one could hear me, I was shut out. 

“Thanks for the pancakes!” It said and with an evil grin added “mom”. 

“I'm gonna head out for a bit,” it continued.

I started to cry. I had no power to do anything. All I could do was watch. 

“Alright dear, stay out of trouble!” My mother said.

“Always,” it replied.

It headed towards the door and I followed. Right before it stepped out it stopped and turned around to face….me. It let out an evil smile and said a simple 
“ thanks”.

 With that it stepped out into the world.



I had no choice but to follow it. I was determined to get my body back, some way, somehow. I knew my best bet was to just stay with it and try to learn all I could. It just walked around what seemed like randomly. It stopped at a starbucks and ordered a drink. Then it moved on to a deli and tried a little of every candy in sight. It stopped at almost every shop of every street. Eventually we reached a library. I saw it pick up the pace and move towards it. It had logged onto a computer and stayed there for hours. It was looking up the events of the last 80 years or so. From wars to politicians. I horrifying realized what it was doing, it was getting itself up to date on all the events it must have missed! 

I couldnt help myself, I yelled at it again “what the fuck do you want from me!!” 

It ignored me. I knew it was aware of my presence, how else did it know to give me that sadistic smile earlier. Hours turned into days. I just followed it, with no power to stop it. It tried everything, museums, restaurants, even concerts. It was making up for lost time. 

My world was turning more and more grey with each day I was in the spirit world.It got to the point where even noise died down. I could still hear the outside world if I focused enough on an object. But I knew it was only a matter of time before the world would go silent. I kept following it, as the world faded more and more I made sure to put all my focus on my body and whatever took over it. 

One day it looked at me. I froze, it always ignored me,what now? 

“It will only get worse. Soon all you will see is an abandoned city and an abandoned world. The people, the moving cars, all will soon disappear, you will be cursed to walk forever alone and unable to die,” it said. 

I didn't bother responding, I knew there was no point. 

“I am sorry but I was trapped there for so long, but then I saw you. I've been watching you and following you, waiting for the perfect moment to try and take over,” it continued. 

“Unless I leave you will never be able to return to your body. And I'm sorry to say I don't ever plan on returning to that world. I suffered enough in that...purgatory,” it said.

“Soon even I will disappear from your sight, no matter how hard you try to focus,” 

It smiled.

“Ive been there, I know, all I can tell you is look to the light if you wish to return,”

And with that he walked away. I knew it was useless to follow. I accepted my fate and accepted the fact that my body was lost to me. This darkening world was no my new reality.




I didnt know how long it had been now, weeks, months. I was in what seemed like purgatory, and all alone. I was still free to go anywhere I wanted, but there was nothing left to see. It was just like that thing said, nothing but deserted buildings and darkness. I was still alone. The world I saw was dark and cold. Cold...what I would give to actually feel cold again. I couldn't feel anything anymore. I couldn't hear anything or smell. At one point I did feel despair, but now ...now I feel absolutely nothing. I just wandered aimlessly. I had no choice. I couldnt ask for hell, I couldnt kill myself, all I could do was wander. 

Then one day it happened. A small light in the distance. I moved as fast as possible. I remembered what that thing said, “look to the light,”. As I got closer I saw the light was coming from one of the buildings. I moved faster towards it and through the last remaining door that separated me from that light. As soon as I walked in I saw that same light being sucked back, into a body! I was in shock. I could still see them, even though they were dark I could still see that person. The first person in god knows how long!

Im that very moment it all made sense to me. This was that persons first time astral projecting! Just like my first time, I didn't last long before being forced back into my body. This must have been how that thing found me! When you enter this world you must become visible to all who were here! 

With my new “enlightenment” I had gotten a new idea. An evil, but necessary, idea. If I followed his man long enough, if I waited for him to get stronger and be able to abandon his body long enough, perhaps I could use that as my chance to finally return to the real world. I could finally leave this place and be free! 

I tell you this story as a cautionary tale. Don’t try new things that you don't fully understand. This universe is larger and more grand than anyone could imagine and it’s secrets are...limitless. When you talk to your loved ones, be it your mother or father, your husband or wife, your son or daughter, be cautious. They may not be who they seem.

I remember a good amount of stuff about her, though.

* Her thumbnails are almost always black backgrounds.
* Her videos, at least, back then were only audio. Still image of a girl against black background, very similar to the thumbnails.
* She was small back then. Under a million subs (I know, wide range), probably under 500k if I remember correctly.
* In many videos, she has a Latina accent that comes out in certain words, and I believe the fact that she is Latina is is mentioned in the thumbnail of another video I saw but didn't watch.
* She has a somewhat low voice.

**Video I Remember The Best**

* The video I remember the best is one where her character asks the listener if they can be partners in a group project-- I believe one about the periodic table?
* Her character says she finds it uncomfortable to talk with so many people around
* Her character becomes overwhelmed by the loud classroom around them, and asks to go get coffee and talk there.
* EDIT: This video did not end romantically, unlike some of her other ones.

1g09jn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/chronicfatigue/comments/1g09jn7/after_ten_years_of_severe_chronic_fatigue_i_am/,After ten years of severe chronic fatigue I am healing!,"Hiii, I have no idea how I was never a reditter as there is so much info on here that I desperately wanted when I was struggling and sick with severe chronic fatigue. But I am glad I have found reddit now so I can share my story.

I want to share because I know what it's like to feel stuck and desperate with health challenges that seem impossible to overcome. I had severe chronic fatigue for years, it's been an almost ten year journey back to health for me. For years I thought I would never run or do sport again, or travel or work again. I am doing all of those things now!! 

Let me tell you that I tried EVERYTHING to get my health back! No expense was spared in the pursuit of regaining my health. First I did all the mainstream treatments, sent to psychiatrists because doctor's insisted I was depressed, immunologists who offered nothing, and then the infamous CBT and graded exercise therapy at a Fatigue Clinic here in Sydney. None of these treatments helped me and I found myself getting worse and worse.

In the first year of illness I gradually progressed from fatigued & working a little to becoming mostly bed bound, I had just finished university and had a highly competitive graduate position that I had to give up. I could barely read texts on my phone and was in pain 24/7. The brain pain was the worst, I felt like I was being tortured, plus the nerve pain. I'd never wish this pain upon anybody. I basically just lay in bed all day, vegetating and struggling to watch TV or do anything. The only movement I would do in a day was getting from my bed to the toilet, sometimes the lounge and back. I couldn't have friends visit because the pain from having to concentrate on conversations was too much. I struggled with this for a few years. 

Eventually I found holistic medicine and naturopaths and integrative doctors who could help me. I tried every diet and supplement in the books. I was diagnosed with Lyme Disease and went overseas twice for Hyperthermia and plasmapheresis. After over 6 years of herbs and antibiotics I had improved but I was still unable to work and mostly housebound. I tried everything, eradicating mould, marcons, MTHFR, herbs, IV vitamins, acupuncture, kinesiology, chiropracters, osteopathy, traditional Chinese medicine, ART trained practitioners, multiple diets which I followed to the tee with no cheating, colonics, daily coffee enemas the list goes on... I forget some of the things I did because I tried it all.

I had heard about nervous system work over the years but rejected it because I thought it was rubbish. I thought that this meant that my symptoms were fake and all in my head and this triggered me after my initial experiences trying to find doctor's to take me seriously. Eventually after coming back from hyperthermia treatment in Germany and then a concussion (when it rains it pours ehh) I finally thought I would give brain retraining a go.

I am so glad I did because it truly ended up being the missing piece of the puzzle for me. Learning to regulate my nervous system has allowed my body to finally heal and I am now out in the world doing so many things I used to dream about. I believe all the physical things I did prior and the diet and supplements I continue to take are helping but the deeper I go into this journey the more I can see how important the mind body connection is. I truly believe the nervous system is the root cause of chronic fatigue and other chronic illnesses for so many people. 

I just spent almost three months solo traveling europe recently, I felt so free and happy. I completed a hike that was 7 hours, plus days out biking all day, swimming, eating whatever I wanted. it was truly a dream and at times I had to stop and let myself shed tears of pure joy and happiness at being back out in the world

  
Please don't hesitate to reach out! I know that desperation and feeling of being sick and helpless but I know that you can overcome this and heal! I know so many people who have healed using nervous system regulation and I want more people to know about it!! I am writing this for the version of me who was sick, helpless and desperately searching for hope and answers

  
Sending big love to all of you  xx",4,1728529796.0,chronicfatigue,1,0.83,False
1g09iz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/lexapro/comments/1g09iz2/lexapro_helped_fix_my_life/,Lexapro helped ‘fix’ my life,"So I started on 5mg of lexapro at the very start of 2024 in January, when they prescribed me it they told me to stay on it for 9 months. At that time, I was doing veerrrry badly. My anxiety was so bad I couldn’t sleep, couldn’t eat, my body hurt all over from the stress and my hair was falling out. 

I hit my breaking point and was literally crying on the phone to my doctor begging for medication. They prescribed me lex. Getting on it was HORRIBLE. Worst 2 weeks of my life. Most of the major side effects subsided after around 6 weeks. 

Things sort of stagnated after that. And I guess I really see now what people mean when they say antidepressants don’t cure your mental illness, they just give you the mental clarity to help fix it. 

When I was younger, I was sexually abused by a family member. Before taking lexapro, I’d only ever told one person, and that was a friend I’d fallen out with years ago. Nobody in my current life knew, it was a secret that I carried around and desperately hid from everyone. The ways I ‘coped’ with that were far from healthy. I knew one day it would come back to bite me, that one day it would all spill out. 

In my first week, when I was still getting horrible withdrawals from the lexapro, I realised that what I feared was happening. I’d pushed my trauma down for years and I couldn’t push it down any longer. It was coming out in all this anxiety I had, and I needed to do something. 

So I messaged a friend that same night, who I knew had been through something similar, and told her what happened to me. And finally, it wasn’t a secret anymore. 

Eventually I picked up the pieces of myself. I bought some rosemary oil for my scalp which helped my hair thicken up. I did stretching to help with all the body pain. I made efforts to start going outside again (I was too anxious to leave the house for quite a while). It wasn’t easy and didn’t always go well, sometimes I’d leave to go for a walk and I’d have to turn around because I felt so anxious. Sometimes I’d try and have a nice time in a coffee shop but the whole time I’d be struggling not to have a panic attack.

But I kept at it, I’d do research on reddit forums and the internet to learn how to get better. The youtube channel ‘Therapy in a Nutshell’ really helped me with anxiety, I spent time trying to learn her techniques. I basically learned every anxiety relief technique out there, and even tried making up my own. 

I bought a book about CSA to learn more about my trauma. It had a treatment plan you could follow, but the first step would involve me actually telling someone in real life about it, and although I tried I could never do that. 

I let go of my therapist who I’d been seeing since last year. Which sounds counterintuitive but she hadn’t been helping me in the slightest for months and clearly wasn’t equipped to help me with my issues. Now I wasn’t paying for therapy, I used the money to start going to the gym again which helped immensely. I built up muscle, started eating better and became all physically fit again. It really helped my anxiety. 

By this point, 9 months had passed, and I had been counting down the months to get off lexapro since I had a pretty intense love-hate relationship with it. So I tapered down over a couple weeks, and now I’m off it completely.

And, in a weirdly cyclical way, the week I first came off it, I finally worked up the courage - I took the first step and told my mum about the sexual abuse I suffered as a kid. And now, I’m going to get therapy with a therapist thats actually equipped to handle that, and I will finally heal from what happened to me. 

For years, I felt like my life was on pause, because it more or less was. It is impossible to move on from the past if you’re constantly living in fear from it. But for the first time ever, my life is moving forward. Do I feel happy? Not really. I feel all sorts of things- quite a lot of them bad! Yet I’m finally doing something sensible with my life and as much as I never wanted to admit it, I don’t think I would’ve got here without my prescribed 9 months of 5mg lexapro.

Thank you for reading if you did.

going to very brief here because i’m tired of asking for advice lmfao…

I (25F) met a guy (26M) by matching on  Raya, following him on IG and he DMed me. We texted all day and the next day. He’s a musician with a couple million followers, and he had a concert (he’s on tour) that day so he said he’d like me to go. I went, had a great time, and then went over to his apt after. We hung out, talked, and ending up hooking up. I drove him to the airport, and he texted me an hr later saying “what a lovely night” “excited to see you when I get back” etc. and we texted for the next 3 days, and I left him on read for 12 days because he said “well I can’t wait to hangout when i’m back” and I assumed that meant that he didn’t need to talk until then. (he had 3 shows, 6 interviews, and threw a first pitch at an MLB game) I knew he was busy and I was too, so I was using this as time to learn to grow out of my anxious attachment. 

12 hrs after he landed back in LA, he called me at 1pm and asked to see me. said he was at a coffee shop nearby reading his bible. (this makes me think he actually likes me.. seems wholesome and was during the day) I was on set, so I couldn’t but he called me again that night and asked me to hangout with him and his friend (even more famous than him). disclaimer: I only add the fame information because I don’t think 2 celebrities would be comfortable inviting over just a random girl/hookup if they didn’t trust/like me. 

I went over, stayed the night with him at his apt again, and we had some deep and intimate conversations. learned about each other, and cuddled/shared intimacy. and it felt good. the next morning he was in a hurry, had a ton of things to do that day so I said bye and he kissed me 3x. I called him the next day and asked if he was free to see him before we both leave town again for 12 days.

His 2 best friends know about me as we’ve spoken on the phone in front of them and met them both. he says we should do things that take place during the day, but simply haven’t had the time as we were both in town for only 2 days at the same time since we met. 

this week, he’s on the east coast at a premiere and going to an event with family. we didn’t make plans to see each other next. i’m not sure what to do. we don’t owe each other anything, and I don’t want to scare him away by reaching out if he doesn’t want anything. but i’m interested in him and don’t want to give off the impression i’m not. but I also don’t want to bother him :’) advice please!!

This an attempt at creating my own reddit cheating story. It did turn out longer than I intended. Mights have gotten cared away with details. So I will be posting in multiple parts. I hope its enjoyable. Be gentle. 

  
**My girlfriend of one year cheated on me. I never predicted what would happen next.**  


This story takes place over the course of several years. So it’s a bit long. Please be patient with me.

So, before I go into this story I need to lay out some history in order to create some context. Pretty much my entire life I have suffered from bad depression and social anxiety. I am now 38, but when I was 30 I got diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. For those of you who don’t know what that is, it is a personality disorder that results in someone having a very hard time regulating their emotions. It’s believed to have stemmed from some form of childhood trauma or abandonment. It usually results in impulsive behavior, emotional outbursts, a lack of self identity and a pattern of unhealthy and unstable relationships, be it friends or romantic relationships. For those of you who do know what it is, please don’t villainize it. I can guarantee you that whoever you knew that had it has been struggling emotionally far longer than you know. And also more than likely severely regrets whatever they did in order to ruin the relationship. They more than likely have not reached out to mend things because of embarrassment or a fear of rejection.

Okay, now that we have that out of the way, onto the story. So I met Sarah roughly 4 years ago. My friend Ali, who I had not talked to in several years, had reached out and wanted to check in on me. I was surprised since I was just under the assumption they were tired of my mood swings and decided to cut me out of their lives for good. She wanted to know how I was doing and if I wanted to come to a party they were having at their place this weekend. We talked for a bit and I let her know things had been a bit rough. 

At this point my depression was so bad that I never did anything except go to work and come home. I did not talk to anyone or hangout with anyone. I was all alone. So at the urging of my therapist, I accepted the invitation. 

That weekend Ali’s husband, James, came and picked me up and took me back to their place. The party had not started yet, but there were a few familiar faces, and there was definitely one I had never seen before. It was Sarah. Now right off the bat I was very intimidated by her, because she was absolutely gorgeous! I mean in my head she was miles out of my league. Everyone I knew was happy to see me and they all gave me hugs, it felt good, but awkward. I was introduced to Sarah. She was a friend of someone I knew and it was actually her first time at Ali and Jame’s house. She looked at me, smiled and said hi. I said hi back but then quickly looked away. I was too nervous. After a little while more people showed up and the party was underway. 

Now everyone I knew drank, and to excess. But I had quit drinking years before. So being basically the only sober person at the party was…well weird and a bit uncomfortable. See I’m not a fan of small, cramped and loud spaces. And that’s what the inside of their house felt like. So after a while, when I was feeling overwhelmed, I stepped outside and sat at a table in their backyard. After about 10 minutes or so of trying to decompress, I heard the door open and then close. I turned to see who it was, and it was Sarah. She walked up to the table and asked if she could join me. I was super nervous, and sadly, a bit skeptical. My past relationships, platonic and romantic, had left me constantly on edge and a bit mistrusting. But I said it was no problem and she sat down. She asked me how I knew everyone, and I told her I have known Ali since I was 18, and I met everyone through her. But we don't talk as much these days. She asked me why, but I deflected the question. We just continued to sit there talking. The longer it went on, the more relaxed I was becoming. After what felt like 5 minutes, but was actually an hour, Ali came out to see where I had gone and found me and Sarah talking. She asked if everything was okay and I told her it was, I just was decompressing from feeling overstimulated inside. After that Sarah excused herself and went inside. I followed shortly after.

I stayed at the party until about midnight. That was when my social meter just hit zero, and I had to head home. Everyone else was drunk, so I needed to call an Uber to take me home. I said my goodbyes to anyone who was coherent enough to understand, and I stepped out front to wait for my ride. I didn’t even notice but Sarah came up from behind and sat down next to me. She asked what I was doing, so I told her. I commented on how she didn’t seem as drunk as everyone else. She explained that while she did drink, she wasn’t a real heavy drinker. This immediately appealed to me. We kept talking until my Uber showed up. I told her to have a good night and went home. 

The next day I was off work, just sitting at home drinking my coffee when I got a text. Which was weird because I never got texts. And what was weirder was that it was a number I didn’t know. Turns out it was Sarah. She said she enjoyed talking to me, so she got my number from Ali. Again I was skeptical of her. Why would she want to talk to me? I was no one interesting or special. I didn’t get it. 

I responded and we just spent the next hour or so texting back and forth just talking about nothing. I had noticed the night before that she just seemed like someone who was really easy to talk to, and it was only proven today. So over the course of the next several weeks this became a daily thing. We would text back and forth most of the day. Eventually she asked if I wanted to go grab a coffee sometime. I reluctantly agreed. We met up at a local cafe and spent the next two hours just talking and laughing. It was during this conversation that my BPD got brought up. She told me that she actually had an aunt who had BPD, and she understood how difficult it is to live with. That made me feel relieved. She told me about how things had been a bit rough for her lately as well. Her apartment ended up having black mold, so she had to move out. But then she was laid off from her job. So she was staying with her mom till she got back on her feet. 

So, Sarah and I became fast friends. Now, I have a problem where when a pretty girl shows me positive attention, I tend to over analyze and overthink everything. And I definitely did that with Sarah. I had developed this huge crush on her, and it was probably very obvious. And between my constantly shifting emotions and the overthinking things, I from time to time would have breakdowns. It had been three months since Sarah and I had met. And that is when my breakdowns tend to happen the most. And like clockwork, they did. I would get jealous of other guys, but keep it to myself. I would think that her and other people were only spending time with me because they had pity for me. That she was talking bad about me behind my back. 

One day Sarah could see that I was feeling extra emotional that day. She asked me what was wrong and I told her it was nothing. She insisted I talk about it. And after some back and forth I gave in. I told her about all the thoughts and feelings I was having. I left out the part about me having a crush on her, but other than that, I spilled my purse out on her doorstep. After I was done she kind of just sat there staring at me. It went on for what felt like forever. Then she reached out and pulled me in for a huge hug. It kinda freaked me out and tried to jump back, but she just grabbed me and pulled me in tightly. She told me that she would never do that to me and she knew that what I was feeling was not my actual feelings, but my trauma coming to the surface. Now, if I didn’t have a crush on this girl before, I certainly did now!

I'm 39 and have never been in a serious relationship.  

  
I think part of what hurts is when I go out and see all these couples, happily chatting in coffee shops, grocery shopping together, just being normal.  I've always been around normalcy but never been able to partake in it.  And as I get older I don't know...it gets harder to feel optimistic or hopeful about being able to walk this tough journey with someone else.  

I am not a good looking white guy, so that also limits both my dating and friendship chances.  

It's odd...I really don't have high expectations or expect something special.  I guess I just yearn to actually really like someone (and vice versa).  Does this feeling ever get easier ?  It just seems like the stuff everyone else gets to do so easily...is such a pipe dream for someone like me.

Should I tell him? Even though I've been 10 months clean.

Long story incoming/something to get off my chest and onto 'paper'


My parents got divorced when I was 12. My mom moved pretty far away and I used to live with my dad. I've had a relatively normal childhood despite this I feel like. My parents used to fight and be awkward for the first few years (since my mom cheated on my dad).

My little brother and older sister were struggling really bad with this when we were younger, they both seeked professional help and they have given it a place in their lives. I on the other hand was never busy with any of this and just lived my life all the way up to when I was 21 years old and moved out of the house to live on my own. I was doing fine, listened to a lot of psychedilic rock music with my friends. They had done a lot of shrooms and acid and whatnot previously and I up until that moment in my life had never used any drugs. I was super curious and used acid with them once, 1 tab, in a forest where we rented a small cabin. It was the most magical experience ever!

I should have left it here. This was not the case. I started using acid one day a month at first, then once a week and finally I started upping the doses from a single 100ug tab to multiple tabs at 500ug total. This was over a course of 2 years. I also tried some shrooms and 3mmc in that time.

Mentally I was doing really bad. Work was not going well, I started to distance myself from everyone in my life and I was using alot of acid. My brain was completely fogged and I was getting super depressed. In that time I also broke up with my then girlfriend and I started using more.

Then one day. When I took the 500ug dose I had an ego death. My soul left my body, and i started evaluating my whole life. I came to the conclusion I missed my mom throughout my childhood and I never gave that a place in my life. The next day when I was sober I called up my mom, met her for coffee soon after and had a really good talk with her about the whole situation. Told her everything! The drugs, the problems I've had and we talked it all out. She also missed me in her life and we are actually meeting up alot more and include each other in our day to day. My brother and sister also know this all and I've talked to them both about this.

That day I used the 500ug was the last day I've used any drugs. This was 10 months ago. My mind has never been this clear before and I feel at total peace with myself and my past situation.

My dad however, I've never said a word about any of this ever. Despite him being the closest person in my life. I keep having this feeling in me that I need to tell him my story aswell. I don't want to keep him out of the loop. Another side of me says I shouldn't tell him, I'm through the bad situation and I will never use drugs again.

What do you guys think is the best option? I'm kinda scared I might hurt my dad emotionally. But i feel like it is something I should tell him.",1,1728527797.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

And it's always something super random, like recently it was rotisserie chicken skin, the other time it was overcooked pasta of a specific shape that I don't remember the name of. It's not that I actually feel this taste, but it's like I expect to feel it. Like I just took a bite of that specific food or see it in front of me and am anticipating this taste or texture in my mouth. And it's literally almost all I can think about at the moment. I'm imagining how I'm eating that food, imagining in the most flattering almost p*rnographic detail. The only thing that helps is distracting myself for a long enough time with studies or drinking something caffeinated, ideally black coffee.

I don't know what might cause it. People say that something similar happens when you're vitamin deficient, but my bloods were fine and I honestly don't think that between my binging and psychotic orthorexia I have any deficiencies. I have also had trouble with periods where I only recently got one after two years of them missing (not entirely weight related, I've been weight restored for over half a year), so maybe it's something hormonal, but I've done hormonal panels in the past and there was nothing abysmal there either. And with my 200 mg of Zoloft and 200 mg of Topamax combined I should really not be having this problem.

I f’d up this morning having not enough coffee yet and ended up deleting a datacenter when I meant to delete just a couple of VMs (we’ve all been there, right? RIGHT?!?). This was a “remote” site with a 2-node cluster and around 20 VMs, however it also was a vSAN one with a remote witness. The removal of course removed the witness and about half of the VMs ended up unresponsive.  Pretty sure my pulse about doubled when I saw the ‘delete datacenter’ task in the console. 

So after taking a few calming breaths and letting the rest of the team know I made a boo boo, I engaged support with a critical ticket. Within 15 minutes, I was working with an incredibly helpful storage expert and we were able to recreate the cluster and get things back up in another half hour. No data loss, no additional outages, no ‘sfc /scannow’. 

Been in this field for over 20 years and it’s humbling that no one is immune from the occasional mistake…you just have to be honest about it with your team and those affected, and then get to work fixing it. Hopefully learn something from it too…

I’ve always been a tad gassy 🤷🏻‍♀️ but I’m noticing that it’s been really really bad for the past year or so. Lots of gas, bad smelling, and stomach pain if I hold it in. I’ve tried to think about what I’ve consistently used/eaten daily and a Matcha Collagen powder really stands out to me. I end up having 4-5 cups of it a day because I’ve got an 8 month old baby and need the caffeine 😅 Some posts/reasearch talk about diarrhea, constipation, gas, and bloating. So I’m gonna test this theory out.

But I need my matcha daily (coffee makes me anxious) but I absolutely HATE the plain matcha powder that you have to whisk - partly for taste (too strong) and partly for the routine of it - the matcha collagen is so easy to put in a mug and pour hot water over it and it’s ready, no whisking!

Any recs for a replacement situation? Is there anything else that exists these days? I’d even switch to something like chai but they’re always loaded with sugar and that isn’t good for the skin! Is there something magical that exists? 🤔 ",0,1728527400.0,30PlusSkinCare,4,0.5,False

I definitely do not have any feelings for her and we also haven't been in touch since so there's no way for me to know if she's with/seeing someone. All I want is to meet her for a coffee for a few mins - check how she's doing and go back to no contact.

She's very clingy and there's a high chance of her mistaking that I want to give us another try, the chances of which happening are less than 0% if you ask me.

Do you think that it is a good idea to say hi, check up on her and then go back to living to my life.

Personally, it can either be a very friendly catch-up or one of the biggest mistakes of my life.

Feeling a lot better, mentally and physically. Am still a little tired, but just starting getting some strength to work out again, finally. 

I worked out a lot before, but was so tired and lethargic. Luckily I am only working part time, but have been having quite a few interviews/exams. I feel a lot more focused and that heart dropping anxiety for something that isnt even a big deal is completely gone. Feel like my body is finally rehydrating, that was my bigfest reason for quitting caffiene, that and it masks any issues that you have physically and mentally. 

Also I just started drinking some Pero, it's a coffee alternative, caffeine free. I make it with honey, a little heavy cream, cinnamon, and nutmeg. It's a nice little dessert. Going to be a go to when winter hits.

Good luck everyone, think it only gets better after 30 days.

- it felt like the cece reveal was so long before but it was one episode and didn’t even answer all of the questions that we had. 

- why did they move on from Lesley stone so fast 

- not one person thought to call Sara’s mom and ask the situation…?

-trauma is so downplayed in the show, the girls often tried to quieten han for expression how Charles was a psycho for Ali’s sake but cece LITERALLY kidnapped and tortured then. They didn’t spend much time healing, like at ALL.

- tanner was an awful detective. 

- also how did toby not get any type of promotion within those 5 years but lorenzo did???? 

- Shauna was never addressed properly, like…how did aria just get away with that???

-how did the moms get out of the basement?

-how did Jessica fake Charles’ death, take cece to the funeral  after getting special permission granted for her leave, and then read it her as Charlotte…like WHAT???? HOW does that even work, explain it to me, not ONE answer for that. 

- what happened to the whole company fund thing that Rhys was running 

-how did Andrew have so much footage inside the dollhouse? Did cece plant it or did he uncover it and if so why couldn’t the police do that to find them…

-Ezra, Malcom and Ezra’s mom… what happened to that storyline it got dropped after we found out Ezra was trying to still see Malcom but his mom just never came back despite being so adamant about wanting to be involved in it all

-how did Ezra go from being a desperate high-school  teacher who was broke as hell to owning the coffee show 

-the whole beauty pageant thing was so random…

- personal opinion: I cannot stand Alison and season five is so pointless and boring and filled with so many random storylines that contributed absolutely nothing (except monas death). I loved Ali when I watched before but it’s clear how horrible of a person she is and the entire shift of her trying to- and failing - to be a soft caring church goer is just….insane???

- oh and Holbrook??? What was that about??? He went from being kind to Hanna to whatever that was

Time agent Orion Starfleet Captain who takes malicious compliance to its extremes with a pair of ""for the love of God Captain Ozera if you don't get your bare grimy spacepunk pirate feet off my floor and put some fucking red and black standard issue boots I'm gonna float you before I have my morning coffee"" 
""why yes admiral right away, red AND black"" 😈

Not gonna get to it this year, but because they're bolt on soles I'm gonna make custom Starfleet delta soles for them by the time gencon rolls around and have some fucking SICK one of a kind Captain's boots

However as time passed I started to feel a bit lonely without being able to see friends in person. Lately I have been trying to get to know people more at my work and other events but not quite finding a good friendship connection (and people around my age). That brings me here seeing if I can find someone to chill at a coffee shop with or a fair or other outdoor events with. I'm very much a quite person and have a very mellow vibe but I'm not shy. I am open to having all sorts of conversations, listening to others, and want to positive and uplifting for others. 

I work full time as an IT support tech and use my evenings and weekends to practice and learn hobbies. I've been investing into quite a few hobbies since trying to be less online. Learning crochet, learning photography, practicing digital art, learning Japanese again, \*trying\* to read more, and recording music. Most recently I've been working on getting more active with walks and bike rides (I'm 6'4 240 with a bit of a belly that I'm trying to shrink down) and taking dance classes which have been a lot of fun! It's a lot of different things but if any of those stick out to you I'd be happy to focus more and improve on one.  
  
I do play video games though not as much anymore with the above activities and not too many multiplayer games but I have a PC and a Nintendo Switch to play on. I only watch anime on occasion as well these days but I am a One Piece fan! (take what you will with that)

I'm not looking for anyone too specific since I consider myself Ace, except for that you'd be around my age +/-5 years or so, preferably if you don't smoke cigarettes, and someone with good positive energy! If any of that interests you feel free to send me a message :) Thanks for reading",1,1728526467.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.66,False
