After trying so hard to make ends meet at the cafe, we consistently come up short every month to cover all the bills, with rent being the largest. That gap has been getting smaller, but we haven't yet seen enough of a trend to tell us we would eventually break even soon enough to keep putting more money in with no end in sight.      

Retail and restaurants have been challenged since COVID. State employees and catering have been helpful, but the real need is more local housing and that's still years away.

So, we decided that Monday will be our last day open. We learned a lot, met really great people, and do not regret the attempt. Maybe it would have succeeded in a different location or with better facilities, but as is, we just couldn't find a sustainable path forward. 

We made wonderful friendships with those who ate here and made us your coffee and game spot.  Thank you. Come by this weekend to bid farewell to the team and play one last game at There and Back. 

Capital Books is still doing well and will stay open and continue some of the There & Back activities. We'll host game nights and tournaments, our themed dinners (possibly at Empress with a full kitchen and not the tiny kitchen we've been working from), and neighborhood activities. We are not giving up on Downtown and running a business here. We're just having to let this one go. ",4,1731017124.0,Sacramento,0,1.0,False

We need Help!

Photos:

* pic 1 is a shot from my living room capturing kitchen and dining area.  
* pic 2 is a flat 360, however  [Here is a Link to view it properly](https://app2.ricoh360.com/viewer/bdd6d1f6-05bf-4993-9f3a-477095bc2a51)  I numbered most of the walls on link so its easier.
* pic 3 is a screen grab of roughly what we're planning to replace the sideboard with.

Some Info:

* Flooring: We just redid them, its why things like the liquor cabinet is empty, boxes above counters and the rug in living room is empty.    [Torlys Monaco Oak](https://residential.torlys.com/collections/laminate/rivera/).   The new floor has good grain with mild texture. It has a greyish tone, I don't see yellows or reds.
* Floorboards: they're white. They look brilliant white beside my tanned walls, but if I hold up a piece of paper to them, they're more of a slight slight cream. The color-match paint ordered by the floor installers says ""Sherwin William Semi Gloss yellowish Trim"". There is some other information for the colour match, but I'm guessing its basically white with a touch of ""deep gold"" 
* Ceilings:  11'4"" in this area.  
* I have a very large South facing window that allows a lot of diffused light.
* kitchen cabinets: an oak grain, tinted dark brown.  I wish the cabinets were taller for more storage instead of 4+ feet of wasted space
* *The dining area is going to have a significant change*. The 8 person table replaced with a 6 person extendable table.  The sideboard shall be replaced by Ikea built-ins.  This area will house all our coffee/tea/liquor, their glassware as well dining room table items like place mats etc.   Questions on this area below.
* The living room: not much change here, the side table and coffee table will eventually go but no rush.  I'm sick of looking at the Ikea canvas but we can't afford good art, especially  at that size.  This may end up getting an over hall into floating shelves with some plants, a couple large prints that aren't as big, etc.

My  partner wants white walls.  I was thinking White or Grey, which are just a spectrum of shades of white to get lost in.   But the floors are already kind of grey.  Grey seems to be a fad for the last couple years.  I don't want the house to look dated because I had chosen something trendy.

  
questions!

1. What color should we paint?  we both want neutral, how white of a white? or how much should it slide into greys or browns?
2. accent walls?  
   * no accent walls?
   * I thought an accent on wall 8. Or wall 7 and 8.  but don't know where to stop on wall 7.  perhaps a different wall all together?
   * color or material? I'm at a loss on this one.  A solid color, neutral or a pop of color? a different paint is easy enough to budget, the other ideas can be a slippery slope.  Maybe a geometric wallpaper? Maybe some kind of texture like those thin wood vertical slats or just 1x4's that are painted and installed with a design?
3. Ikea cabinets?  
   * We're thinking about flat blue or maybe black with grain?  We like the Grey, but there's too much grey talk already to add more tones of it. 
   * should our kitchen cabinet looks be considered in this decision?   
   * I feel like the color here directly relates to the accent wall decisions.  
   * I want that one Ikea cabinet to be high for very rarely used glassware.  How high is too high before it looks odd?  the wall by the stairs/fridge as well as wall 6 is 97 inches if that should be considered.
   * The smorgasbord of random things on wall 8 will be gone.  Replaced with one or two large pieces, and maybe some floating shelves.  (note the liquor cabinet will no longer be needed)
   * for counter we like Ikea's butcher block, as well as homedepot has a some oak or acacia butcher block.  (I assume all are laminates)
4. Does the new dining table need to tie into anything? The Ikea cabinets or counter?  the kitchen cabinets or counter? the floor or paint?  It will be wood, should I avoid yellow or red tones?
5. For the Kitchen, could I take off the crown molding and add a level of cabinets? I can't match what's there.  should they match the Ikea cabinets? or maybe both areas can have the same brown VADHOLMA Wall open unit.  but that might look odd in Kitchen.



wow.  this is a lot, maybe i should have broken the post apart, but its an open concept area...

I was 16 when I first watched GG and i liked how he just mustered up the courage to ask Nicole out - now I wonder why he couldn't extend the same courage for lorelai- when I was 16 I thought it's maybe because he LIKED HER TOO MUCH now I'm 19 and I've had my fair shares or lukes and Chris's and I can say for certain it's because he didn't like her enough 
I personally liked someone like alex(the coffee guy) for lorelai,her and luke just doesn't seem right, although we're lead to believe he's all in - he really isn't and out at the first sight of trouble

WELL it does- luke unlike Christopher is a good person, most of Christophers actions are insufferable but all's forgiven because he's charming

I M33 and my ex F30, were together for 9months last year, she broke up and I got her back after 2 months of no contact. 8months later she has broken up again.
This time is different, there was a lot of closure from her side, and although I stated I don't want the breakup, it really does seem final.

Now, the issue. We live in a small island, and in the same bay. We are going to run into each other more often than not. I just did, at our usual coffee place 20mins ago.

The thing is that after the first breakup, I put in the work, I knew what to do (on paper) to have a chance at getting her back, and it worked. Now, I don't want to move from a position where a reconciliation would be a thing in the near future, but from a place where It is really done. Again, on paper, I know what to do, but seeing her driving past, or at places where I'm also going to be at, is going to slow down the process massively.
This is, without even taking into consideration having to see them with other people down the line.

Is there anyone that had a similar situation and would have some real practical ways that you were comfortable with this?

For the record, I prefer to be comfortable having to see her, rather that avoiding her, cause it would be cutting me from enjoying places and people.",1,1731016981.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

(i am safe, begin working with a therapist for over a year now, solid support system, and have no desire to break my sobriety.)

my mama passed during the height of covid and the stress of the last presidential election, so this anniversary just feels so much more volatile. 
all of this to say, i’m just missing my mama terribly. she was a beautiful, kind soul and we were just starting to enjoy the years of mother-daughter closeness after my crazy puberty filled teenage years (lol) 
she would have loved that it was time for the holidays again. she would have been so excited to meet my cousins first baby in a few weeks on thanksgiving. she would have been so stoked that it was time for the holidays again; to decorate and go shopping. she would have LOVED binge watching the secret lives of mormon wives with me. 

whenever i was having a hard time and crying a lot, my eyes would puff really badly and sometimes get close to swelling shut (a genetic blessing i inherited from her) so when that happened, she and i would play hooky, hit up some goodwills and vintage shops, get ridiculously sweet coffees, and treat ourselves to a nice lunch. so tomorrow, my partner and i will be doing all of these things in memory of her. i will laugh, i will cry, and i will choose to reach for the memories of my mother, and feel all the love i have for her.

All weird drama aside, I messed up by not clocking in, didn't I? I'm entitled to compensation for being there and discussing my role, parts, equipment, etc. It was all business related.

I ordered this lamp off of eBay back in August, with an estimated delivery of September. It was shipping from the UK to the US. There was no tracking (first red flag), but the seller was super responsive when the item didn't arrive. So far he's called me (left a voicemail because I didn't recognize the number) and we've texted back and forth quite a bit. He keeps saying there have been issues with customs and has been working on getting me a tracking number. I don't understand why, if I had been scammed, he wouldn't just take the money and run at this point (it's past the return window and not covered by eBay's ""money back guarantee"").

1gm2dqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1gm2dqd/aio_about_my_wifes_eating_etiquette/,AIO about my wife's eating etiquette?,"I'm (34M) wife is (37F). I have been with my wife for 9 years, married for 5 years. I would describe my wife as a sloppy eater. Not trying to make fun of her, but she eats like a 5 year old. She lacks awareness of how she's eating and gets angry at me when i point out the messes she makes with food. Would like to find out if I'm overreacting to this.

I will list out some examples and history of what happens. Anytime she eats something that contains sauce, it ends up on her chin and cheek areas and she never notices it's there and will walk around like that. The sauce also ends up on her shirt and in her hair. She has long hair that lays against her chest so if sauce drips off her food it ends up in her hair very easily. Again she never notices the messes on her. A lot of times we both eat meals on the couch in front of the TV and most of the time small scraps of food will get on the couch or on the floor in front of the couch. She has a problem of not eating over her plate so the food easily drips onto her shirt, couch, or the floor. When i eat on the couch i pull the coffee table toward the couch so i can set my plate on it and i lean forward eating over my plate that's sitting on the coffee table. That way if food does spill it gets back onto the plate or the coffee table. This sloppy eating of hers carries over to restaurants, family and friend events. It does get embarrassing at times.

Over the last month or so we've both been eating a lot of queso cheese dip. As she's eating there are small bits of cheese dip that drip onto our couch. It's white queso so it looks like we have cum stains on our brown couch. It's now to the point where I'm embarrassed to have people over cause they might think we have reckless sex on the couch and get cum on it. Everytime she makes a mess she of course does not realize it. Everytime i point this out she snaps at me stating i am lecturing her. When i do point out the messes she makes i always advise that she needs to eat over her plate to prevent messes from happening so of course she points out i'm lecturing her. This snapping at me has been going on the entire nine years i've known her. I ask her why she gets so defensive about it and she says it's because i sound like her parents getting onto her. When i do get onto her about the messes i dont' yell or scream, but i do use a stern dad sounding voice. I use this stern voice to express my frustration. I'm not going to speak happily to her while she makes these messes.

I'm getting tired of seeing no improvement on this, seeing our couch getting ruined, tired of her snappy attitude when i point this out. I always have to vacuum her crumbs off the couch because she does not want to clean up her crumbs after she's done eating. She says she will clean the crumbs off later in the day. I believe the crumbs should be cleaned off right away after eating so we don't get ants or mice in the house. When we're at a restaurant with her mom her mom will point out the food mess on her face and actually grab a napkin to wipe her face. That is a very cringey thing watching a 37 year old woman getting her face wiped off by her own mother. Makes her look so childish. I know we all occasionally get some food on our face or on the floor, but with my wife it's like this almost everytime she eats. She has awareness on everything else in life, but with eating she turns into a 5 year old with no awareness of the messes she's making. I really don't think she's on the spectrum, but i can't figure out what her deal is. It was never enough of a dealbreaker for me to end things with her in the beginning, but now with our couch getting ruined i'm starting to lose some respect for her as she doesn't seem to care about respecting the nice expensive couch we own. It's not so much about the sloppy eating but her bad attitude towards me when i point these things out and her lack of awareness. This has become a real marital issue that needs to be rectified.

Is there any special words or phrases that i can use that gets her to see my point and get her in gear to take better care of her eating etiquette? Hopefully i described this situation with good detail. I'm happy to provide more detail if needed. Is there a way to express my frustration without sounding stern? But i feel in order to express my frustration a stern sounding voice is needed. I feel as long as i'm not yelling or screaming it's not mis-treating her. She probably does feel embarrassed hearing her husband trying to teach her better eating etiquette because this is something you only hear when you're a small child. 

TLDR; Wife is a sloppy eater and does not realize she's making a mess. How can i effectively get though to her so she can better take care of herself? Am i overreacting to this?",1,1731016733.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

\- How am I really feeling today?

\- What’s one thing I need for my mental well-being right now?

\- What’s rolling around in my brain space?

I also have coffee every day with butter and half & half. And I include non-sweetened electrolytes. 

I am on week 4 of this diet and in the beginning I was very hungry and snacking on spoonfuls of butter. I am not worried about calories. I just eat when I am hungry. The last few days though I notice that I am really not that hungry. This morning I had my coffee, ate a couple breakfast sausage patties, and for lunch I had maybe 1/4 lb of ground beef.. which I had to force myself to eat. Not because I didn’t like it, I just was really not hungry at all. I am 5’3” and weigh 126lbs. I am in NO WAY trying to lose weight. Is it normal to go through bouts of not being hungry? 
I’m not used to this at all. Before I was on this diet I basically lived in my kitchen snacking all day long, and I was always thinking about food. So it is nice to feel satiated, but I am worried about losing weight if I don’t have an appetite to eat as much.

I was raised on the principle that you don't tell people what to do with their lives unless they ask for it. I am 34 year old gay, atheist, democrat living with my husband in Northern California. I know N. CA is much more conservative than the rest of the state, but I never expected this to actually happen to me. 

My brother was in CA (2hrs away) this week and the only night he was free to meet up was the night of the election. Got a room at his hotel, had fun, woke up to be disappointed. I take my coffee with a dash of sugar and a heaping amount of misery to go outside and smoke a cig. I went and sat on the curb that was kind of backed up to a corner of the building, away from entrances and windows, wanting to be alone. Then, this seemingly normal guy comes up to ask for a light. I stood up to get it out of my pocket and the next few minutes were as normal as they could be. He seemed a little jittery, or excited maybe, but I soon realized in this chat that he was just feeling the opposite of me about the election results. Whatever. Btw, this guy was about 6 inches taller than me.

Then he starts talking about how there isn't unity anymore because  -get this-  ""they stopped allowing churches to ring bells for all to hear, thus throwing off the frequency of the people"" 

Direct. Quote. I kid you not.

I was feeling a bit numb from the election (and one too many drinks with bro) that I just kinda let him say what he was saying. At first I thought ""wow, let's see where this goes"" but that went south pretty quickly. He started getting closer, using his hands to gesture a lot more, casually tapping me on the shoulder like we've known each other forever, talking about how great god is. Then, he starts referring to me as his ""brother in christ"". At this point I am fully backed into the corner and that's when he put his hands on me. It happened so fast. I don't know if I disassociated for a few seconds or not but I literally cannot remember the moment this escalated. It's a little fuzzy and incomplete in my memory.

First, he had a hand on my shoulder, then his other hand on my chest, then a hand moved to my face, then the other down my arm, all the while praying for me, and I lost it. I put my arms up and swiped them down my front to get his hands off of me. He looked so surprised! He actually looked at me like I was crazy. 

I said ""Please don't touch me.""

His. Response. To. That. Was: ""Sorry man, what's that about? Were you abused as a child?""

Wtf?

I didn't know if this guy was on something, high on drugs, high on christ, high on trump or whatever but I was in flight mode at this point. What if he was high on something? I was cornered with a lunatic. He could have a knife. I don't know what this guy is capable of and I am shaking. I am not the strongest, but I could tell this guy could overpower me with ease.

I pushed away from him, and went back in the hotel as fast as possible, not looking back. 

Wtf. What the actual fuck. I went in my room, called my husband and freaked the fuck out. I notified the front desk people when I checked out a few minutes later. Hit the road as fast as I could.

These people exist. These people that think it is totally appropriate to walk up to a stranger and tell them that they aren't right because they don't have christ in their lives. And then they touch you. 

But now, looking back on it, should I have done more? Should I have called the police or at least ask the hotel to look at surveillance footage in case this guy comes back?

I just feel so violated.

# What’s a Bitcoin QR Code, Anyway?

First things first, let’s talk QR codes. Those little black-and-white squares have been around for years, mostly used to direct people to websites or menus. But with Bitcoin, they’re taking on a new life! A Bitcoin QR code can contain your Bitcoin wallet address, making it easy for others to scan and send you funds without the fuss of copy-pasting a long string of numbers and letters. Think of it as a magic portal to your crypto wallet!

The Bitcoin QR Code Generator app is here to help you create these codes with zero fuss. Just enter your Bitcoin wallet address, and *voilà!* You get a sleek, scannable QR code that anyone can use to send you Bitcoin instantly. Plus, it’s totally free, so you can use it as often as you like.

# Why Use a QR Code for Bitcoin Transactions?

If you’re still copy-pasting Bitcoin addresses, it’s time for an upgrade! Bitcoin QR codes make the process much smoother. Here are a few reasons why switching to QR codes is the way to go:

1. **Speed and Convenience** 🚀 Imagine you’re at a coffee shop that accepts Bitcoin. You want to make a quick payment, but typing out a 34-character Bitcoin address? Not fun. With a QR code, it’s scan and go! Your barista is happy, you’re caffeinated, and no one has to wait around.
2. **Better Accuracy** 🕶️ We’ve all been there—one tiny typo in a crypto address can send your funds who-knows-where. QR codes eliminate this problem. With a quick scan, you’re sending or receiving Bitcoin with precision, every time.
3. **Sleek and Professional** 🖤 Sharing a Bitcoin QR code looks infinitely cooler than rattling off your wallet address. Perfect for impressing friends or clients who are just getting into Bitcoin, or for business owners looking to simplify payments.

# How to Use the Free Bitcoin QR Code Generator

It couldn’t be easier! Here’s a step-by-step guide to generating your own custom QR code with our app:

1. **Visit the App** 🖱️ Start by heading over to [https://www.bitcoinqr.io](https://www.bitcoinqr.io). Once you’re on the site, you’ll see the Bitcoin QR Code Generator front and center.

4. **Download and Share** 📲 Save your QR code as an image, print it out, or share it digitally. You can add it to business cards, social media profiles, or even put it up on a website. The possibilities are endless.

# Ways to Use Your Bitcoin QR Code

Wondering where your new QR code can come in handy? Let’s talk real-world applications:

* **Businesses and Freelancers** 🛒 Perfect for business owners or freelancers who want to accept Bitcoin payments without the fuss. Just display your QR code in-store or on invoices, and let customers pay with a quick scan.
* **Social Media and Websites** 🌐 Put your QR code on your profile, add it to your website, or print it on flyers if you’re promoting an event that accepts Bitcoin. QR codes make it easy for supporters to donate or pay instantly.
* **Gift Cards or Invitations** 🎁 Got a friend who loves Bitcoin? Send them a custom QR code with a small amount of Bitcoin loaded on it as a gift. It’s a cool way to introduce others to crypto and makes a unique gift they’ll remember!
* **Fundraisers and Donations** 🤝 Hosting a charity event or fundraiser? QR codes make it easy for donors to contribute quickly. No more lengthy explanations about crypto wallets—just scan and give!

# Tips for Making the Most Out of Your QR Code

1. **Label Your QR Codes** 🏷️ If you’re creating multiple QR codes for different purposes, label them to keep track of where the Bitcoin is coming from. This is especially handy for business owners with several revenue streams.
2. **Promote Your QR Code** 📢 Don’t just make a QR code and forget about it! Share it everywhere that’s relevant. The more you display your Bitcoin QR code, the more chances you have to receive payments.
3. **Make It Easy for Your Audience** 💡 If you’re promoting your QR code online, add a little explainer text for those new to Bitcoin. Let them know it’s easy to scan and secure.
4. **Customize It** 🎨 Feeling a bit creative? Add a unique border or background to your QR code. Make it reflect your brand or personality, so it stands out and attracts more attention.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

I know I f up in terms of cleaning most of the time.

My wife looks at these instances and constantly belittles me by shouting at me stating that I’m a spoiled brat and it gets on my nerves. Of course I have no expectations from her that she’d put the dishes in the sink immediately and am perfectly fine with any of her choices. I often get the feeling that maybe I should improve myself. I even tell her that she doesn’t have to shout or belittle me but can only tell me to do something and I’d do it immediately. I don’t know if I’m not proactive enough or if the belittling is too much.

For context, My wife used to have servants at her place but after moving to the US, she’s forced to do some chores herself. She hates it.

Angry Birds was just some guy, after all. Your app is genuinely useful, well-thought-out, and fills a real need that Tesla hasn't addressed. Here are some suggestions to further enhance it:

1. **Payments Tutorial & Apple Pay Integration**: Consider including a brief, guided tutorial for setting up payments. Currently, it's not obvious how to use this feature. Better yet, integrate Apple Pay as a default payment option, as it's trusted, secure, and simplifies the payment process for users.
2. **Transparency & Data Usage Confidence Builders**:
   * **Data Use Explanations**: It’s 2024, and privacy is a huge concern for users, as many apps continue to abuse data practices. Include explanations during the setup process about how user data is used or not used. Highlight any data privacy measures and reassure users that their data is not stored, sold, or misused.
   * **AI and EULA Clarity**: Explain clearly whose AI you are using and what users are consenting to in terms of data processing and usage. Provide a plain-language summary of the EULA, with an emphasis on whether their data is used to train other AI systems.
3. **Calendar Access for Contextual Stops**:
   * Integrate calendar access to enhance route planning. For example, if a user has an upcoming meeting, the AI can suggest a coffee stop that fits within the time available before the meeting starts. Offering granular permission controls can help users decide which events to share.
4. **Reminders Integration**:
   * Leverage reminders with locations and times to optimize trips around errands or appointments. Smart notifications can also prompt users when it's time to leave, factoring in real-time traffic conditions.
5. **Media and Playlist Integration**:
   * Allow users to create or select playlists for their journey, using the phone’s media library or Tesla’s compatible streaming services. Integrating voice commands for hands-free media management would further enhance the driving experience.
6. **HomeKit Integration**:
   * For users who are not MyQ subscribers, integrating HomeKit would enable smart home controls, such as opening or closing garage doors, adjusting thermostats, and more, all while approaching or leaving home.
7. **Contacts Access for Navigation**:
   * Enabling navigation directly to a contact's address by simply saying ""Drive to Steve's house"" would simplify route planning. Provide privacy options so users can control which contacts are shared with the app.
8. **Weather Insights for Destinations**:
   * Offer users weather information at their destination to help with planning. For example, suggest indoor stops if bad weather is expected, or alert users about rain or snow conditions.

It started with really bad pre-syncope symptoms, just happened out of the blue one day. It was so bad I could barely do anything without feeling like I was going to faint. I suppose some of it is on me, coz I had a bad habit of not eating for a day or two and then eating something small. Usually unhealthy too, but not always. 

My symptoms:

* Blood pooling in feet (still have this on the sides of my feet, bit it seems to be getting better slowly but surely).

* Blurry vision and visual auras

* Pre-syncope

* Severe heat intolerance (hot baths or showers).

* Unable to bend my neck certain ways for fear of passing out.

* Random spells of dizziness

* Random tinnitus spells

Anyway, the doc told me to up my salt and eat more often, add caffeinne or coffee to my daily routine. He actually suggested energy drinks like Red Bull. I told him I cannot have energy drinks as they tend to mess me up quite badly. 

The next part I am guna heavily disclaimer coz I am not a doctor nor any kind of health professional.

I was basically just like ""I cannot live like this"", and started looking for natural elements to heal myself. Now look, I know some of you are already rolling your eyes so hard.... I myself used to be a skeptic of this, but here is what I found:

I had to start a little low impact exercise routine. I am nearing my 40's and am female. Girls, if you get older you need to adjust exercise to your age, you aren't 20 anymore.

I started eating a light breakfast of yogurt. One with good cultural bacteria is preferable.

For lunch, I have yogurt again, a bit more than breakfast portion, and to this I add one teaspoon of Vitamin B1, thiamine aka Unfortified Nutritional Yeast. And I also take one SlowMag (slow release magnesium supplement. Multivitamins dnt work).

For dinner I have some type of meat, some veg that I have cooked myself or like stirfry (stirfry with butter and NOT plant oil!), and only about a handful of carbs, I prefer potato but egg noodles is also great. If you like rice, I suggest brown rice NOT white. With my dinner I also take one Digestive Enzyme supplement and one tablet of milk thistle (please read up on this as it releases estrogen, it helps me with my perimenopausal symptoms too, but is not for all people and esp not for pregnant or lactating women!).

It has taken about a month and a half for me to start seeing results... but they are there. I can now enjoy my hot baths, I am not gassy and bloated anymore. I dnt get dizziness or pre-syncope symptoms anymore. The tinnitus is much less than before and I sometimes dnt even notice it anymore. My bp is stable and I dnt really have to do calf muscle stretches anymore before I get up to go somewhere. All in all, 4 little nutritional changes and one dietary change has basically performed miracles for me. 

I am not claiming it will work for everyone, I am not claiming anything. I am just asking what you have to lose. I havent had one low bp dip in a long time. And I have been sleeping so good at night. Sometimes I will have little moments, but then I look at the clock, and be like ""yep, havent eaten, havent taken our supplements... this is why we feel shit."" Then I do my thing and I am back to norrmal again. 

I am also guna leave this vid here for people who have bad low bp, these 3 simple exercises to bring low bp up has saved me from pre-syncope many times. 

I just hope my insights on my own problems helps someone else out there, and if anyone has good blood pooling solutions that work, I am all ears.

1gm1jj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gm1jj4/not_all_imaginary_friends_are_friendly/,Not All Imaginary Friends Are Friendly,"Have you ever known true fear? No, I’m not talking about the heart palpitations you get when watching a scary film, or even the extreme discomfort that say a fear of heights or spiders may bring on. I’m talking about raw, unfiltered terror. If you haven’t then allow me to describe it to the best of my abilities. It’s like having a split personality, one side of you is paralysed, numb to everything around you, every sound muffled and distorted, even your own thoughts. On the other side of it your mind is simultaneously screaming at you, neurons firing in overdrive as it begs your nerves to release their death grip on your muscles and let you get away. I’ve experienced such a feeling once. I’d only known Katie for a few weeks but when I awoke at 3am to see her kneeling astride me on my bed, the painfully wide, manic grin that split her face bouncing as she gave those deep , earsplitting, inhuman giggles. Behind the kitchen knife raised over my chest, her gaze was locked onto mine, empty but for the cold, furious madness dancing within her almost glowing blue eyes. If my sister hadn’t shrieked from the doorway at the sight, snapping me out of it long enough to instinctively punch the distracted girl in the face before throwing her to the floor and making a run for it, I know my life would have ended that night. It was pure luck that my little sister had fought with her parents earlier that day and begged to crash at mine for the night. Pure luck that she had woken to use the bathroom when she did and heard the giggles. Pure luck that I’m alive to write this now. However, what I’ve learnt over the past few days has taught me a valuable lesson. 

I thought nothing would come close to the fear I felt that night, somehow, living through such an event made me feel stronger. Until I read those damned books. Until I started questioning my own mind, my own… sanity. I thanked my lucky stars every day since that I’d remained in the world of the living. Now though? Now I’m starting to think I’m the unlucky one…

Apologies because this is going to be long. 

I first met Katie almost exactly four years ago. From the moment I laid eyes on her I felt this strong protective urge which made sense considering the circumstances. I was walking home from work on a Friday night following a blazing row with my boss that I was pretty sure would mean more job hunting in the near future. I’ve never been good at holding down employment. The weather reflected my mood, the cloying, gray clouds seemed to smother any light coming from the street lamps while the downpour of rain drenched my clothes leaving them clinging tightly to my defeated form. I hadn’t realised one of my shoes had suffered a tear until part way into my walk but the wet squelch every time my sodden right roof met the pavement was a constant reminder. I was only about five minutes from home, the bottle of whiskey in my cupboard mentally calling to me after my shitty day when I heard it. Barely audible over the raindrops thundering against the floor, there was sobbing. I slowed and looked around before I spotted her. Sat huddled against the wall in a small alleyway was a young woman. Her hands were clasped against her ears as if trying to block out the world while she rocked back and forth, uncontrollable sobs wracking her tiny, soaked body, strands of hair clinging to her cheeks matted with both rain, and the tears freely flowing from her eyes. She was pretty, even in the state she was in it was easy to see how attractive she was. That probably helped in my following decision. I like to think I’d have done the same for anyone but I often didn’t make the best choices in life and the way I’ve treated people has left me with plenty of regrets, I’m ashamed to say. Shaking some water from my hair (not that it made the slightest difference) I sighed quietly and walked over to her. 

She didn’t notice my approach, between the palms clasped to her ears and the tightly shut eyes, I was all but invisible to her. It was only when I reached out and gently touched her arm did her soft, brown eyes spring open in surprise, looking like a startled animal debating whether or not to flee. I stepped back, hands raised in a peaceful gesture with what I’d hoped was a kind smile on my face. Her gaze remained firmly locked on me and I suddenly had doubts as I realised how out of my depth I was.

“Are… are you ok?” I’d asked, flinching as I finished upon realising what a stupid question it was. The girl regarded me for a few more seconds before shaking her head as fresh sobs began to bubble up. I wanted to run away, I wasn’t equipped to deal with this, this was so far out of my comfort zone that all I wanted was to be far, far away. But I didn’t. There was something about her, her frail, tiny build, looking even smaller in the curled up position. The kindness swimming behind the distraught veneer in her eyes. This was someone without a malicious bone in their body, to just abandon her like this would be human. “S-sorry, I don’t want to be rude but I want to help… I’m Will…” I trailed off helplessly. The ghost of a smile appeared on her lips if only for half a second.

“Katie,” she whispered back hoarsely after a few seconds, “and thank you, but I don’t think you can help.” Despite the situation, the warmth and authenticity of her tone made me glad I hadn’t run, increasing that protective instinct I felt towards her.

“Well, at least let me call you a taxi to get home, sitting out in this can’t be helpful, unless you’re a secret mermaid,” I tried to joke and cheer her up, instantly cringing at how decidedly unfunny it was. But she laughed, it was a short, weak laugh, I’m sure she was only doing it to be nice, or maybe she was laughing at the weakness of my humour but either way, it thrilled me to see that momentary cheer slipping through her devastated facade before she crumpled once more, whispering about how she couldn’t go back to that place, even the thought of it seemingly terrifying her. 
“I only live round the corner, if you want to at least get out of the rain I can fix you a coffee.” I mentally facepalmed as I said it. As if she would just accept an invite to someone’s house who up until two minutes ago she’d never laid eyes on. 

“Ok..” she sniffed, a little warily, fixing me with those glistening, trusting orbs. In that moment I wanted to keep her safe from all the evils of the world, I hated the fact that such an innocent looking, trusting person could be in so much pain. I held out a hand and she gingerly took it, letting me help her to her feet. That was how I met Katie.

Upon returning to my house, she had slumped exhausted into a chair, gratefully accepting a towel while I muttered an embarrassed apology about the mess (which she waved away, of course) before going to flick the kettle on. It was only when she took the mug that I realised how badly she was shivering, she must have been outside for hours. The grateful smile I got after fetching her a blanket made my heart melt a little. I nearly dropped my mug when she explained the source of her misery. Her older brother had been found dead in a park that very morning. I remembered hearing of his death when I got to work, the latest in a string of vicious murders that had rocked the area over the past few months. The prevailing rumour had been that he’d been walking home drunk after a night out and passed out in a park bench only for his cold, mutilated corpse to be discovered by an unfortunate jogger early the next day. Upon telling me this, she had once again dissolved into helpless tears. Me, with my limited skills interacting with women, had decided the most comforting thing I could do was lean forward and gently pat her shoulder (yes I know, pathetic really). The tight hug she pulled me into as she sobbed into my chest filled me with a calming, blissful sensation I only ever experienced with her. 

Throughout the evening I slowly got more information from her. She lived with her brother, at least she had, hence why she couldn’t face going home. After a couple of hours, I asked if she was hungry and offered to order a takeaway. Sure, I had food, but I didn’t think offering her a pot noodle was the best course of action. She’d smiled and nodded but insisted that she would cover the cost to thank me. I tried to disagree but she wouldn’t budge and that was how we ended up huddled beside each other, eating Chinese and watching Netflix within four hours of meeting each other. I offered her the spare room that night. My roommate had moved out about a week back so the room was empty, and it had a bolt on the door I reassured her. I could tell she didn’t want to be a burden but the exhaustion after her day had begun to get overwhelming so she agreed and thanked me with a peck on the cheek. Katie ended up staying with me all weekend and it was the happiest I'd been in a long time. Seeing her slowly coming out of her shell and gradually begin to smile more gave me an indescribable rush.

On the Sunday night she said she was ready to go home, but shyly asked if I could come with her. I agreed without hesitation. She had sobbed upon entering her apartment, despairing at seeing her brother's things that he’d never lay eyes on again. Once more, I comforted her and helped to calm her down. She begged me to stay the night with her and once again, my agreement came without delay. When she tiptoed into the living room at midnight, just as I was nodding off on the couch, and asked me to come and share her bed because she felt so alone in there, I didn’t need to be asked twice. I wrapped her up in a tight hug beneath the sheets, only giving the weathered looking stuffed toy on her bed a glance, before she turned to me, thanked me again and gave me a soft kiss, this time on the lips. We had sex for the first time that night. Yes I know, you might think I was taking advantage of her being so vulnerable, and the thought crossed my mind many times but she was very much the instigator. I like to think it was her way of distracting herself. Not that I was complaining, it had been a very long time and being with her was mind blowing. 

We saw each other every day for the next three weeks and I felt like I was living the high life. Every day she grew back into herself more and more, that tiny, shy smile I’d seen that day in the rain blossoming over time into a joyous beam. I’d never met such a gentle and caring soul. Katie loved nothing more than going for walks in the park and scattering food for animals. I’ve never seen someone happier than she would be when she was petting someone’s dog. The time we saw a dead bird by the side of the road she’d cried and cried, insisting we take it away and bury it. Honestly, I found that to be more than a little far but I simultaneously loved her for it. Yes I know, we’d hardly known each other for long but I already knew I loved her, I’ve never loved anyone like that and doubt I ever will again. 

I also learnt a lot about her past. It made sense how well she was getting over her brother’s death when I learnt of her childhood. She had grown up with her father, she didn’t remember her mother, the woman having left when she was still a baby. From what I can gather, all she had wanted was a son, she had no wishes for a daughter and had one day just walked out with Katie’s brother, Mark. Her father had forbidden his wife’s name from even being spoken in his house. I had felt so angry that someone could just abandon such an incredible girl but I was relieved to hear that her upbringing was so happy. As she put it, her father showered her with more love and attention than any other parent could begin to manage. Unfortunately he had passed away a couple of years prior. Mark had reached out to her a year later and they’d started seeing more and more of each other until they got a place together, making up for all those lost years.

It was just over three weeks since I’d met Katie that I awoke to see her there with the knife. Not an hour before I had drifted off with her snuggled up against me and now there she was about to snuff my life out like a match being clasped between two fingers. You know how the story goes from here. By the time the police arrived, she was rocking back and forth in the corner, bawling and screaming, constantly cursing ‘Greg’, whoever that  was. When I discovered that Katie was responsible for all the murders that had been terrorising the city, I didn’t believe it. How could such a small, frail, gentle soul be behind such atrocities. Evidence doesn’t lie though, and it was damning. I was there for the entire trial, the whole process I felt my world crumbling. The Defense listed disorder after disorder and I felt sick to my stomach. Sick with pity, this wasn’t her fault, it… it couldn’t be. I tried so many times to meet her eyes but she’d never look at me, instead rocking back and forth in the dock while she sobbed uncontrollably and muttered about Greg. I don’t think anyone was too surprised when she was sent to a mental hospital but I felt the remaining shards of my heart break.

I visited her just once. Visits were forbidden for the first month but as soon as I could I went to see her. She looked good, but she could barely meet my eyes. There was a doctor nearby but she had no restraints or anything, I guess due to her stature she wasn’t seen as any kind of risk. At first she wouldn’t even look at me until I begged her to do so. When she did, our eyes were only locked for a second, those soft hazel irises bringing a light back into my life momentarily before she burst into tears and turned, running from the room calling herself a monster. The Doctor gave me a sympathetic smile and turned to jog after her. When he returned and informed me she wouldn’t be returning and didn’t want to see me ever again, I didn’t even try to hold back my own tears. 

Every day felt horrendous without Katie, I never moved past her and when I met Lewis, I jumped at the opportunity I had been given. Lewis was a friend of a friend, he seemed like a pretty boring guy and I’d probably have never thought twice about him. I got stuck next to him in the bar, trying to make awkward small talk. When he revealed that he worked at the same hospital Katie was being held at, I damn near jumped for joy. Just like that I made it my mission to get close to Lewis, if only for the constant updates I could get about Katie’s progress. I know he found it a little strange, and he even said as much to me once, but when I explained a little of our personal history he relented, conceding that she was one of the sweetest people he’d ever met.

I learnt that her first year there she’d been erratic at best, some days kind, friendly and eager to please but others she’d just scream and shout and rage against Greg. He asked if I knew who Greg was since all the staff there were at a loss but I was just as stumped. Since then however, she’d been making excellent progress. Her meltdowns had steadily become more infrequent until they had completely stopped almost a year ago. When I learned that Katie’s case would be coming up for consideration into her entering a supervised living arrangement I let out a genuine whoop. 

Three days later Katie killed herself. It was the 29th October and it was all over the news. Apparently she had stabbed herself in the face and neck so viciously and so many times that it was impossible to identify the body by sight alone. I reacted the only way I could, by spending the next week totally drunk with one question in my distraught mind. Why? It was a week after the news broke that Lewis found me, clutching an almost empty bottle of whiskey in the corner of a bar we hit regularly. He gently prized the bottle from my fingers as I looked up at him with unfocused eyes. The pitying smile on his face made me ashamed of myself and I’ve never hated myself more than I did in that moment. Pulling out a chair across from me, he put his bottle of Corona down on the table while placing a glass of water in front of me and telling me to drink. I did. Lewis offered his condolences as was to be expected before hesitating, his voice taking on a more serious tone.

“Look man, I know how much she meant to you so I’ve got something here, don’t tell anyone though because it could cost me my job.” Lewis muttered, looking straight at me. I straightened up, the booze fuelled haze clearing somewhat as I focussed on him. “She uh, she wrote, wrote a lot in her diary, she had a big box of them going back to when she was younger. They were in the pile of stuff to be incinerated because there was no next of kin but I grabbed the box… thought maybe, you’d be interested…” he trailed off as I nodded furiously, it would be nowhere near having her with me but it was something, some small part of her. Mark nodded knowingly and slid a small box over to me. I made my excuses to leave as soon as possible, desperate to get home and see the books. Mark didn’t seem surprised and told me he’d see me soon. 

When I got home, I opened the first one in the box and immediately recoiled. There was a crude, childish drawing inside the cover. It was a man, absurdly dressed in an orange and blue pinstripe suit. He had long brown hair with a far too small top hat perched upon it. I recognised it vaguely and made the connection to that aged stuffed toy Katie kept on her bed. The drawing however, was unnerving, it had a manic, almost feral grin, open in soundless laughter while his crudely drawn, almost familiar, piercing blue eyes seemed to stare deep into my soul. Underneath the drawing were two words. ‘Giggling Greg’. I started reading and whatever hope I had in humanity, whatever optimism lived inside me was crushed, slowly, painfully ground into nothing as the harsh reality of this world burnt itself into my retinas. I’m going to transcribe a few of the entries for you below, the ones I think are most important to try and understand the events surrounding Katie. I must warn you, reading these made me feel sick to my stomach.

Note: I’ve fixed the spelling and grammar errors in the earlier entries.

Dear Diary, I finally turned seven! Well actually it was yesterday but I was too excited to write in you then! Do you like my drawing, that’s my imaginary friend, Giggling Greg. He always looks after me when I feel sad and makes me feel better after Daddy gets cross. He looks just like Daddy’s toy that he said he had when he was a boy. He never lets me play with it though because it’s old and I might break it. I wanted to have a party and invite people over but no one wanted to come. I’m so lucky to have Greg and Daddy as friends or I’d have none. I was so happy when I got the big cuddly dog. He fits in my bed with me and he’s called spot. I love dogs so much! Daddy didn’t get angry at all, I think it’s because he wasn’t drinking that yucky drink that makes him talk funny. He can get very mean when he drinks that and it’s scary but he’s always really nice after and makes me feel better.


September 4th 2010

Dear Diary,
I had my first day at big school today. It was very scary, I don’t know anyone and some of the older kids are so big and grown up. Luckily, Greg was there with me, making me feel safe. I have lots of new teachers, most of them are really cool but I hate my science teacher, she’s already given us homework. Daddy asked if I made any friends but I didn’t. He says it’s weird that I don’t have any but I have Greg. Last time I told him about Greg when I was nine though he got very angry and told me I was too old for imaginary friends. On the plus side at least he got me makeup for the first time to say sorry, he got me some sparkly lipgloss and concealer because he said I couldn’t hide my face from people. I don’t talk about Greg anymore but he’s still my best friend, he always looks out for me and says what I’m too scared to. It always makes me laugh when he starts giggling. Anyway I have to go now and do my science homework (YUK!)


April 3rd 2016

Dear Diary,
I accidentally mentioned Mum today and Daddy got very angry, asking me why I was banging on about that stupid fart who didn’t give a shit about us. I felt really bad for upsetting him but I didn’t like him being so mean (you know how much I hate bad language). It’s really stressful at the moment because my exams are starting soon so I’m doing lots of work. At least everyone at school is distracted by that though so they’re mostly leaving me alone. Jessica’s still a horrible bully though. Today she surrounded me with her friends and they kept on shoving me and slapping me. It didn’t really hurt, Daddy hits me much harder when I do something silly and I know that doesn’t matter because he always tells me how much he loves me so why should this matter. I couldn’t help but cry though which just made them laugh more. Luckily lunch was ending so they had to leave me alone. Greg was very angry, he kept saying he’d punch and kick those girls so much that it’d make Daddy proud. I told him not to be mean but he was giggling while he said it so I know he was joking.

 Damnit! I’ve just seen the time, I was so focussed on studying that I didn’t realise it was so late. Dad will be home any minute and I forgot to make dinner for us! This is going to hurt, why am I such an idiot?! Greg keeps telling me to stand up to him but it’s my fault.



January 2nd 2018

Dear Diary,
Sorry it’s been so long, my head’s been in pieces. Daddy died last week. They said he took loads of sleeping pills and it was suicide, that he was already weak from how much he drank. I don’t understand, he never seemed suicidal. Greg keeps saying he doesn’t think it was suicide while giggling, he can be so weird sometimes! Then again, I’m 18 and my only friend is an imaginary one so maybe we’re as bad as each other? I miss my Daddy so much. He loved me so much and was so kind. Even when he got really cross when he was drinking, he’d always be so regretful after hurting me and made me feel so special. The funerals this weekend and I’m dreading it, saying goodbye to Daddy forever. What will I do with my life now? 


November 1st 2020

Dear Diary,
It’s been a crazy week. I’m ashamed to say it but I nearly ended it all when I found about about Mark’s death. All of our childhoods apart only to reunite and then have him taken away from me again. The pain is indescribable. Greg was very nasty, he didn’t like Mark, kept saying we should get rid of him, kept accusing him of trying to steal me. It annoys me how possessive Greg can be but I worked out long ago he’s with me for the long run. I just hope he likes Will. I met him the same day I heard about Mark. He’s absolutely amazing. He showers me with attention and does everything for me. I can’t believe I met someone so perfect. It’s only been a week but I feel like I’ve known him my whole life. I told him about Daddy, how special he was. I didn’t mention the times he got angry though, I know Will won’t understand and I’d hate to make him upset. 

Greg still isn’t sure about Will but I really hope he comes round, he has to, I’ve never met such an amazing person. I hope he doesn’t realise I’m a freak like everyone at school did and run away, I don’t know how I’d cope knowing I lost him. He’s been so good helping me cope with the loss of Mark and he treats me like a normal human! I’m going to meet him now, I’ll check in again soon.


November 13th 2020

Dear Diary,
Kill Will, Kill Will, Kill Will. That’s all I’ve been hearing the last few days. I don’t understand, why doesn’t Greg like him? Why would he say such things? He’s ‘giggling’ when he says it, but it isn’t nice, not like it used to be. Maybe it never was? I put my foot down today though. Greg kept saying that Will only likes me because I’m damaged goods beaten by Daddy. I hate how nasty he is and I finally put my food down. I told him I don’t need him anymore, I have Will and he’s a better, kinder man than Greg can ever dream of being. Greg went very quiet and called me a weak willed little whore still in the grasp of her Daddy’s dead fingers and I yelled at him to ‘Piss off.’ (Sorry diary, you know how much I hate swearing but I was so cross) It worked, Greg’s finally gone. I’m free now, free to enjoy my life with Will.



January 16th 2022

Dear Diary,
They finally let me have you back. I’m sorry. I’m sorry it’s been so long but a lot has happened. I don’t want to tell you right now, I’m not ready but I will. I lost Will. It’s my fault, I’m a monster. He came to see me the other day and I couldn’t face him. I watched him leave from my window, he was in tears and so was I but he can’t be near me, I can’t hurt him like the others. But it wasn’t me, it was Greg. I mean, I did it, but Greg made me, he didn’t go for long, he came back. He nearly killed Will. I can’t put him at risk, he’s so much better without me. Being in this hospital is more than I deserve, you don’t know how bad it is, I deserve to be dead, I’m a stain on the world. The doctors here keep listing all these illnesses but I’m not crazy. I’M NOT. IT'S ALL GREGS FAULT. HE DID THOSE HORRIBLE THINGS, I WASNT THERE I UNDERSTAND NOW! THE TIMES WHEN I DONT REMEMBER ANYTHING GREG IS IN CONTROL! I’m going to sleep, the light hurts, the silence hurts, my mind hurts and Greg won’t shut up. I hope I dont wake up tomorrow.


May 3rd 2023:

It’s not fair, Will’s still putting in requests to see me. Why won’t he move on, I love him so much why won’t he let himself be happy? Greg won’t shut up, calling him a pathetic freak like me. I wish I could scrub him from existence. I hear his giggles every day and every night, the stream of ranting, raging filth coming out of his mouth. There were some frogs in the garden near the pond, they’ve been there for about a week and I loved sitting and watching them for hours. I blacked out yesterday, again and when I came too in my room, Greg told me he squished them all. I went out this morning and saw their broken bodies. I cried so much, I hate hate hate Greg, why did I have to imagine him? Why? Why did Daddy have that stupid doll? I wish he’d let me play with it and break it, even if he’d put me in a coma it might have meant Greg won’t exist. I said that and Greg was very angry. When I came too he’d slammed my face against the wall so hard my nose broke. 

No one else knows this but Greg killed Daddy. He finally admitted it to me. I think I knew all along but he made me crush those pills up and put them in Daddy’s Whiskey. Why? First Daddy, all those other people, then Mark, then almost Will and now the frogs? For what? All of them were Greg. ALL OF THEM! I HOPE HE ROTS IN HELL ALONGSIDE ME THE SICK FREAK! I’ve accepted I’m going to hell. Even if God understands that Greg killed those people he’ll never forgive me for how I’ve hurt my beautiful Will. No not mine, he can’t be, no matter how much I want him, how much I love him. He deserves better than a freak like me.


28th October 2024

No no no no no. I heard them talking about it today. They think I might be able to leave this place soon. I can’t, I can't, it's not safe. I said I shouldn’t be allowed out yet but they said it’s just because it feels like home here now. I’m such an idiot! I hated the pitying looks they were giving me, like they were disappointed in me. I stopped ranting at Greg, just letting his venomous filth wash over me, convincing them I wasn’t a freak. I’m pretty sure I can make enough of a scene at the hearing to convince them to keep me here, but Greg said he’ll take over and make sure they let me out. He promised me that as soon as we’re out of here, he’s going to kill Will and make it hurt, to remind me I’m his. He can’t. He CANT DO IT. I need to stop him. I think I know how but I’m scared. I deserve it though, for bringing this monster into the world. I know it will crush Will. He has such a good heart and I know he thinks the world of me. I just pray he can eventually move on. 

The thought of Will with someone else tears me up more than anything Greg’s done, I know it’s selfish but it’s true. If anything I’m glad he’ll never know what I’m about to say because I think it would destroy him but I truly, deeply love him. In another world I could imagine a life with him, having a family, growing old together, devoting my heart and soul to him as I know he would to me. But not in this world. BECAUSE OF GREG! I HATE HIM. I HATE HIM SO MUCH! HE THINKS HES SO CLEVER AND IN CONTROL! Tomorrow he’ll get the shock of his life. I’m sorry Daddy. I’m sorry Mark. I’m sorry Diary. I’m sorry Will.



I finished reading them all a couple of days ago. I haven’t left my house. I haven’t showered. I haven’t eaten. I’ve just sat there, numb, dead to the world. We call ourselves the most sophisticated species on the planet yet how could we fail such a gentle, beautiful mind. Cause it to crack so badly. Katie truly was an angel, with everything that happened and she still managed to be such a beautiful person. She was right, her words have destroyed me. Irreparably so. 

I saw the first person I’ve seen since I was given the diaries earlier. It was a delivery man, delivering the coil of rope I ordered. I screwed up tying a noose on my first couple of attempts but you really can learn anything online. I looked at it when I was done. Knowing I’d be meeting the same fate as my Katie. Feeling hot, furious rage bubble up knowing how the system had failed someone suffering from a lifetime of abuse and mental illness. As my anger spiked, my boot lashed out, striking my coffee table, sending it, and the stack of diaries to the floor. I froze. One of them had fallen open. ‘Giggling Jack,’ stared at me with those pale, strikingly blue eyes and it hit me like a ton of bricks. That familiarity I felt when I first laid eyes on the picture. I’d seen those eyes once before. Staring at me behind the blade of a kitchen knife…

Hey fellow solo devs! Just released my game and wanted to share my experience of building it with AI, plus the eternal struggle of being an indie solo dev. Grab your coffee, this is a story of ambition, AI, and questionable life choices.

# The ""Great"" Idea

Was binging Netflix at 2 AM (as you do when you're a solo dev with no work-life balance) and saw this word game on ""Devil's Plan"" - a show where contestants compete in various mental challenges (great show btw). Tried to find it on App Store, but couldn’t find anything. As an iOS developer, I thought: ""Hey, I could build that!"". I decided to challenge myself to built an initial version in 7 days using AI as much as possible. I know my therapist thinks I’m crazy.

# The AI Experiment

Decided to go all-in with AI because:

1. I'm solo
2. I'm tired and lazy occasionally
3. It seems like fun

Used Cursor with Claude AI and honestly It felt like finally having a teammate... who sometimes tries to push to production at 3 AM without tests. Still better than some of my past co-workers though!

# The Reality of Solo Dev + AI

Current metrics after launch:

* Downloads: 5
* Active Users: 3 (me, mom, and someone who probably installed by mistake)
* Revenue: Enough to buy a quarter of a coffee
* Hours of Sleep Lost: What sleep??

# The Development ""Process""

**Day 1:** 

AI builds working prototype in 15 minutes just by simply explaining the rules to the AI. 

Me: suspicious staring at code for 2 hours

**Days 2-7:**

* Morning: Code review with AI
* Afternoon: Debug AI's ""creative"" solutions
* Evening: Question career choices
* Night: Polishing, polishing, polishing

# The Tech Stack

* Swift, SwiftUI
* Architecture MVVM + Clean-ish Code
* Firebase for authentication and server db
* RevenueCat to handle in-app purchases (optimistic, I know)
* Mixpanel analytics (to track my mom's user journey)
* Coffee (the real MVP)

# The Solo Dev Struggles

* Had full team meetings with myself
* Played both good cop and bad cop in code reviews of myself and AI
* Created a Slack channel just to post memes to myself

# The App

* The app is called **Devil’s Words Association Game**
* It’s a simple word association puzzle game, yet quite challenging.
* No ads (because I respect my nonexistent users)
* No subscriptions (revolutionary, I know)
* Clean UI (because I can't design complex ones)
* Available now on App Store. Here is a [link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/devils-words-association-game/id6737246063?pt=2248795&ct=reddit.SoloDevelopment.08-11-2024&mt=8) if you bother.

# What I Learned

1. AI is like having an intern who works for free (well $20/month) and doesn't need snacks. It can be brilliant at times, better, faster more efficient than you, but in most cases it needs a gentle but very persuasive push into the direction you want them to move. 
2. Building with AI is surprisingly fun when you're used to talking to rubber ducks
3. Solo dev + AI = Still lonely, but with better code completion
4. App Store reviews are more stressful when you know 66% of your users personally

# The Roadmap

If I somehow hit 1000 downloads (currently at 5, so... making progress!):

* More levels (AI can generate them while I sleep)
* Better app icon (current one is a bit yuck)
* More features, not sure what atm

# The Marketing Plan

1. Post on Reddit ✅
2. Tell my mom to tell her friends ✅
3. ???
4. Profit (still waiting on this part)

# Would love your feedback:

* How's the gameplay?
* Is the UI too minimal or just ""I'm a solo dev"" minimal?
* Any features you'd add?
* Marketing tips? (besides telling my mom's book club)

# The Truth About AI and Solo Dev

Is AI replacing developers? Nah. Is it making solo development less lonely? Also no, but at least now I have someone else to blame when the code breaks.

Let me know if you want to hear more about specific parts of the development process, or try the app and tell me where you got stuck. Also accepting prayers for my App Store rankings! 🙏

	•	Is there a particular setting where you feel more comfortable being approached (public places, community events, coffee shops.)?
	•	What kind of introduction feels most  genuine and respectful to you?
	•	How can someone show interest without coming off too strong or making you feel uncomfortable?

The past: My PCOS symptoms have heavily been hormonal acne - lower jaw especially but when it was bad - back, chest, under the chin and felt like playing whack-a-mole. I was doing chemical peels that always felt like it was putting a bandaid on a bullet hole. I'm in year 5 of a PhD now - but when i had periods of eating inconsistently, surviving on coffee and extreme stress during grad school I quickly gained >30 pounds (going from 140 to 175 ish, 5'8"", 27 y.o.). During this period I had such bad hair thinning. In the space of a few years I wouldn't even recognize myself in pictures. 

things I have tried that didn't work 

* gluten, dairy, and egg free diet for low inflammation (did this for 4 years with clean eating) 
* Running being my go to form of exercise (I was a cross county runner in high school and never really went out of my comfort zone) 
* I tried to go 100% alternative route - acupuncture paired with supplement schemes that I was consistent with for at least 6 months, even under the guidance of a nurse practitioner who did lab work and offered wholistic treatment. Some supplements that I tried that didn't work for my PCOS (ovasitol, NAC, DIM,  magnesium, zinz, etc). 

What has worked so far: 

* skin: found a dermatologist who was knowledgable about hormonally rooted acne and didn't push accutante. Over 6 months we tried new topicals (winlevi - almost a topical spironolactone, which helped getting to about 80% decrease but I wasn't happy with the constant hormonal breakouts) and slowly ramping up spironolactone. I started in 100 mg for first few months (at first I didn't think it was working for acne on face, only really controlled body acne). Went up to 125 mg then 150 mg from months. At month 6 for the first time since I was in middle school I didn't have any acne. In addition to spirinolactone I use my typical regime of tretinoin  + was prescribed topical cream for spot treatments (benzoyl peroxide + clindamycin). I finished my second round of micro-needling (going 1X per month right now). This is the first time in my adult life that I have consistently left my home without makeup. 
* health-food : I tried to kickstart a diet that would be anti-inflammatory that would work for me by doing the AIP protocol (essentially a removal of all potential inflammatory foods and then an introduction of removed foods until you identify what is causing inflammation). With the food you can eat for the first 4 to 6 weeks it leaves you with a heavy protein, vegetable, healthy oils, vegetables. The biggest change I noticed was that my face no longer looked inflamed. Unfortunately I had an emergency appendectomy at the beginning of the reintroduction phase so I didn't really finish it out but I have incorporated eating high fiber-high protein + low added sugar diet. As a vegetarian + busy grad student-I am supplementing with a protein shake in the morning for now but I have found there are good amount of clean protein powders out there and you can still make it whole food by making it yourself. My current protein shake recipe is 2 scoops of protein powder (naked pea) + 1 frozen banana + liquid adjusted to preferred thickness (water, soy milk etc). 
* health-exercise: I have always struggled to have confidence in the gym or to find the time or energy to go. After working all day I rarely feel like I have the energy to make dinner and work out - even when I tried more accessible workout schemes like the 12-3-30 - especially when my energy was low. Although a bit pricey - i started doing lagree classes which are intended to be high intensity but low impact using resistance to build strength - especially core strength. Rather than pay for a gym membership and doing a few yoga classes a month, the only membership I purchased was to my lagree studio. I started with 2X a week (very tough coming back from abdominal surgery). If anyone is thinking of trying lagree but is intimidated I would say that in my experience the instructors are very friendly. Even though you are in a room with everyone with mirrors in front and back -everyone in my study is definitely only really looking at themselves. Since coming back from surgery I have to take a lot of breaks and a lot of the easier options and no instructor has ever tried to push me beyond that. I have now bumped it up to 3 to 4X a week since forcing myself to take 50 minutes every ocuple days to myself is a good mental break for me + benefits of building strength for what feels like the first time ever. Since the workout is full body (core, arms, legs) I never have to worry about planning out a strength training regime and how to increase my weight. I just show up to class with the intention to do the exercises with the correct form for as long as I can. Additionally, although I am not an apple-watch girl, I bought a $50 watch for heart rate & steps (amazfit from amazon). Rather than caring about how fast or far I run, I know just try to get enough walking in the day and a few days of running at zone 2 heart rate (for cardio health, minimizes stress, and optimized fat burning - at least according to the internet). This combination had been working really well for me. Rather than focusing on the scale (which between the MANY diets doctors have put me on and weight fluctuations is not always mentally friendly for me, but tracking my progress with body measurements and how much easier it is to run a certain distance within the heart rate zone has been the best encouragement. I lost 15 pounds down to 160 from 175 lbs before my surgery following this regime - but a month of not being able to do more than walk for 15 minutes and not even open heavy doors lead to a little bit of weight gain back to 168. However for the first time gaining this weight isn't stressful to me because I know I have something that works whereas a few years ago - no matter how hard I worked I could maintain the weight but never lose it. 
* health-stress: Even though I always say exercise and eating healthy is the first thing to go when I'm busy I've had to admit that when I start to get stressed, I only make myself worse when I stop those things that are keeping my health in check. Having an exercise class that I sign up for is the  thing that helps motivate me not to drop it - and then when i do take that time at class (no phone, no podcast, no TV, no emails, no talking on the phone) its almost meditative because I have to focus on just doing the move correct. 

TLDR: Found a good dermatologist and trusted the process, started microneedling now that my acne is gone for the first time in my adult life, found a strength training (lagree) and low intensity cardio regime that worked for me, used wholistic life style changes like eating food that makes me feel better, stopped being afraid of some assistance from western medicine but didn't give up on the wholistic approach.

Or am I overblowing ""normal"" stuff?","Hello, all. I am hoping to have some input on whether I ought to pursue the possibility of a diagnosis or if these are just things that ""normal"" people struggle with. :) So if anyone feels kind enough to skim through and give me opinions, I would be so grateful. I can relate so hard to some things from this community, but others don't fit or are so mild they seem not worth counting. I also have aspects of me that don't seem to fit at all. I truly don't know. I've tried to be thorough on stuff I thought might be pertinent, and I know it's long. lol.

**Taking things super literally:**

Example: as a young teenager, I asked my grandmother (who hated junk food) where to put the soda my grandfather had just bought. Her answer: ""In the trash"". So I did, in all sincerity, even though I thought it was weird and a little wasteful to put 4 unopened 2-liters into the trash can as soon as they were bought. Never questioned it.

Or my husband will ask a super simple question of our toddlers, to try to get a response from them or hear them think through it out loud, and I will answer him thinking he genuinely just wants/doesn't know the answer.

**Mild sensory issues:**

I say mild because most of the issues I can ""endure"" without any ill effects beyond lots of mental/physical discomfort. 

I rip all my tags out, and have as long as I can remember. 

Can't stand stickiness on me. Sometimes just makes me cringe, sometimes near panic. Worse now as an incredibly overstimulated adult, even though it bothered me as a child. 

My skin always feels like it doesn't ""fit right."" That's the best way I can describe it. I'm always adjusting the skin meeting around my neck, elbows, between my toes, under my arms, etc. 

I have ""Even-itis"", as we called it in my family. Having to make things on the body even. I get one hand splashed with water, and it is very uncomfortable until I splash the other in the exact same place. Stuff like that. 

**Being in my own world:**

As a toddler, I paced in circles tapping my forehead saying aloud ""What am I thinking about?""

Lots of similar stuff: extreme forgetfulness, daydreaming, trouble sticking with tasks or hyper focusing to the exclusion of everything else, but lots of that is easily chalked up to ADD which I am nearly certain I've got. Just not sure about ASD :)

Highly imaginative, especially as a child. 

**Intelligent:**

I don't have illusions about being a genius, but I'm on the upper end of ""normal"" people, based on percentiles on national tests while in school, how I ""perform"" in games, debates, tests of logic etc in everyday life and such. I'm just well known to those around me as a ""smart person."" I think this has possibly helped me to cope well since I'm able to fill in the blanks of many things that aren't intuitive by logic, memory, deduction etc.

**Social:**

I don't have close friends. I always wanted to know how to giggle in bed with girl friends late into the night, but I didn't know how. It was like a foreign language that I couldn't speak. My good friends were people that would play imaginative games with me, but we wouldn't have conversations about feelings, boys, life dreams etc. Well, sometimes I would awkwardly bring up such things because I felt like that's what friends ""should"" talk about, but it wasn't natural. 

As an adult, I definitely have people I enjoy spending time with, and some I would consider good friends, but we don't get together or anything. I never seek out company apart from my husband. We do see our families fairly often, and I love both families very much, but I don't seek out the interactions and I am ok to really never see anyone again except for my husband and kids. They are the only ones I truly ""miss"" if we are apart.

The thought of getting together with a friend at a coffee shop or something is uncomfortable and sometimes terrifying. Like, what would we talk about? Would it be full of awkward moments where I try to figured out what would be an appropriate thing to say/ask? If there's an issue I'm concerned about, or something going on in their lives that I think they might want to talk about, I will spend the whole time thinking about how to broach the subject. I end up either never saying anything about it, or awkwardly blurting it out in a weird way.

Have to take breaks at social gatherings, though not to extreme lengths. Depends on the group and what else has been going on. As a teenager I used to disappear during events to ""commune with nature"" or find a quiet spot to mull things over, sing, play the flute etc. I need quiet times. The thought of a week full of activities and social engagements makes me panic. Especially back to back activities. My husband doesn't understand why I start to hyperventilate when we're planning out a busy week. Again, this is something that has worsened as an adult. I always needed quiet times, but I was more able to get them as a child. It's hard to know if these issues were always present to this extent but I never had to fully encounter them because of the abundance of free time, time outdoors, quiet times etc. in childhood. I was homeschooled so I never dealt with a busy, bright, loud school environment on a regular basis.

I am currently very overstimulated, almost all of the time, due to life circumstances. It's hard to know how many of these issues are related to neurodiversity and how many of them are simply due to stress and overstimulation from my every day life. 

**I catastrophize situations. **

Once I burned bread as a teenager and plotted running away from home before my mother found out. I was in hysterics. Of course, once she learned of the burnt bread, I was mildly reprimanded for carelessness and that was the end of it. And I wondered why I made such a big deal out of it. 😂 but I do such things all the time. My husband will bring up a small issue and I will spiral into depression that our marriage is over. 

**Research/fixations**

I have to research everything before purchasing or making a decision. Need to buy a $5 item on Amazon? Research and compare reviews for half an hour. 

Once I have an interest, I want to learn everything about it. And then I assume everyone else in the world would be just as fascinated as I am so I tell them about it.

Sometimes I will get an idea in my head, and I just have to learn about it, researching on an extreme level.  Can't think about anything else. It takes so much effort not to lock myself away in my room without food or a break all day, sometimes multiple days, and sometimes I still do, when I'm not stopped by outside circumstance.

**I can be so oblivious to what is going on around me.** 

I'm constantly trying to hand my husband drinks or food while he is physically engaged other wise . Like, ""Here, honey. I see you're under the washing machine trying to fix something with both hands but I'm still trying to hand you your iced tea that I brought you while chattering at a million miles an hour because I genuinely haven't put two and two together.""

I don't have good situational awareness. My husband goes out of his mind while watching me navigate a busy store with a cart. I truly try to be polite and considerate, but I am constant cutting in front of people, narrowly missing others, standing in the middle of the aisle, etc. This is something I am improving on, but it is really hard and has been a long journey. lol.

1gm0z15,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1gm0z15/i_caught_a_catfish/,I caught a Catfish,"I (47F) am newly single. After 16 years of an emotional abusive marriage, I finally had the courage to tell my then husband that I didn't want to be married to him anymore. It took a solid year for me to regain some confidence in myself. I thought, hey, lets check out a dating app. Worst case scenario, I have a cool story.

So I make a profile on Hinge, like you do, at the beginning of October. Current pictures and honest about what I'm looking for and my life goals. I should add that I work in Information Security, it'll come into play later. Two days in, this Asian Adonis of a man named Luke likes one of my pictures. I'm under no delusions of my hotness scale. I'm not ugly, but I'm a big white girl. That someone who was carved out of a rock thought I was beautiful was caution flag number one. We talk for a couple weeks, move our conversation to personal numbers, continue to get to know each other. I ask about pet peeves, he says when people outside the relationship start interfering. Strongly hinting that details of our relationship should be just between us. Caution flag number 2, I as for clarification. He knows about the abuse I've suffered from my EX and I immediately thought this was an isolation tactic. He assures me that's not what he meant and I can see/talk to whoever I'd like. 

We continue to talk and start to worry that this man is too good to be true. He has a lucrative lumber career, so he's not asking for money. He knows that I want to take our time, so he's not pressuring me into anything. But there are inconsistencies. His profile says he's Korean, but he tells me he's Vietnamese. His dog's name changes from Bobby to Murphy. When I ask detailed questions about what is work looks like, he can't give a straight answer. I chalk most of these up to language barrier since English isn't his 1st language. He's 51 and has been in the US for 18 years. So I ask for a coffee date. I don't want to waste each other's time if it turns out he really doesn't like what he sees. He says he's working really hard on a new proposal for some work and can we do a Skype call instead. I think that's weird, you can't escape your day for a one hour coffee date, but I say sure. It was really weird. He was sitting at his desk with his computer behind him and he was Skyping from his phone in a position like you would take a selfie. There are some audio issues, but eventually we get it sorted out. But he's moving weird. Like really stiff weird. His lips move and his eyes blink and there's a little wiggle in his shoulders and head, but it's not looking natural. He ends the call in less than a minute. Caution flags are now turning to red flags. Throughout this entire time, any time he sends me a picture, I do a reverse image check. To this point, nothing has matched.

After years of being treated like I didn't matter, it was refreshing to have someone tell me I'm beautiful and interested in my day and stuff. We talked about mental health and life goals and everything. I was starting to feel sexy again, a feeling that I thought I'd lost forever. But I didn't let those feelings completely blind me to what I was seeing. We're into four weeks of talking by now. He's telling me he loves me. I tell him thank you, but I can't respond the same. I'm just not there yet. He asks why. I tell him it's because we haven't meet in real life. I only know this one version of you. I don't know ""public"" you. Like how you treat others in public settings, etc. This week he says he's going to Organ to pitch this proposal that he's been working weeks on. His flight is on Wednesday at 9:40am. That morning at 8:30am, I get a message from him letting me know he's leaving now for the airport. In my head, I immediately think that can't be right, how are you still at home for a 9:40 flight. You start boarding like 30 minutes and you haven't even gone through security check points. But I say, okay hon, be safe. I get another message of him at the airport at 9:30 saying their doing boarding and he sends me a picture.

The next day, I run that picture though reverse imaging and I get a hit. I find this man's Facebook profile, that turns out not to be his. It's another decoy. On Facebook he's Kim Klaus. But I also see his Instagram. ""Luke"" has been using this guy's Insta to make a fake dating profile. I see other images here that were cropped for the dating profile. Of course I'm a little bummed Luke wasn't real, a part of me was hoping this was a real connection. So, I slid into the Real Guy's DMs and said hey, you don't know me but. . . and let him know that his images were being used on dating apps and to make a fake Facebook page.

""Luke"" doesn't know that I know he isn't real. I have every intention of stringing him along. I asked Real Guy if he wanted to help or have updates or want to see the images of him I have. I haven't heard back yet. I tried to upload a picture of me, but it doesn't format well.

Wanted to share a few things about me and my fast:

I have previously accomplished a 2.5 day fast but the mental cravings would always tempt me.   
I have to mention this was a long time ago, and I've only ever done two fasts and missed my goal on both of them.

  
This time around, I actually told my parents, still live with them at 26, and that honestly made things so much easier.

Previously it was kind of a secret situation so apart from surviving the mental challenge, I also had to dodge eating around my family which was super hard.

With that being said, my fast started 10pm this last sunday, so its currently day 4 and its been about 90ish hours.

First and second day were actually kind of easy, compared to the first time I tried fasting, and day three I felt a little bit weak, but I was drinking my minerals. I've got to say that I forgot about potassium, and haven't had any since I started. This got me kind of worried so I ordered some NU-salt which will be arriving tomorrow (it was supposed to get here today :( ). 

However, I've taken Sodium and magnesium each day with my 2ishL of water.

Yesterday I dreamt I broke the fast and was so dissapointed in myself, but luckily it was a dream. Today I sometimes get a bit hungry but it's really not noticeable.

The real issue is that i've started daydreaming with delicious food and my thoughts often drift to food and how good it is, and how much I didn't appreciate food. FOOOOOOOD. 

I also got some keto strips and on day 3 I was fully in ketosis according to the color chart, so that's nice. I plan on doing a strict keto diet for at least 2 months after my fast is over.

During the week, it's been easy with work, but I'm afraid I will get tempted to eat something during the weekend.

I've looked in the mirror and the result is amazing, so much inflammation is gone, which is what keeps me going every morning.

I didn't weigh myself before starting but I was probably 105kg so like 230Ib. I will update at the end. So far everything is going fine.

Something notable is that at day 3, I got such intense focus that it was kind of overwhelming, kind of like being on some stimulant or a lot of coffee and also I was fealing a tiny bit light headed.

Day 4 that is gone and the focus is constant but not overwhelming.",0,1731012968.0,fasting,1,0.5,False

I’m trying to be sociable and fun, but nothing works. I certainly don’t look bad, people always tell me I’m smart, and I do believe I’m quite funny (sometimes) and kind.  

I’ve got so many instances of me going to an event/to practice hobby, approaching someone (my age), talking them, being funny (I hope), smile, being open and attentive etc. I always think we connect pretty well, I ask for a contact, we both agree that “oh we shall meet some day”… then I would initiate once, they’d be sick or busy, and it’ll never happen.  They won’t reach out themselves.

I know I could be more insisting, invite them again, text first all the time… but is it ok that I’m always the one doing this? Why not a single person, other than men in clubs, liked talking to me enough to ask for my contact and text me first, and ask me to meet? Are they faking that they enjoy talking to me, or am I not getting the clues? If so, then I don’t get why and would absolutely liked someone telling me what’s wrong with me. 

I do have like 2 friends and 3 acquaintances I  meet once every two months. All these people know me for ages since school or so, but I meet them rarely and in general I feel we’re growing apart. I desperately need new contacts, but I just can’t. At school, I’ve had many girl- friends, though I was always shy in groups.

A week ago I went to an event for students. I made 6 acquaintances overnight, suggested each of them to exchange Instagrams. I was soo happy, we had nice talks, I made people laugh, with three of them we had common interests and agreed to meet and talk again. I didn’t text first just cause I’m tired of the same situations, and no one texted me. There’s another event today that I discussed with each of them, irl they were like “yeah absolutely you should come, let’s meet there”, and I told them I’m new in the city and had no friends, and I asked to text me if they coming … nothing. It’s not that I feel entitled get these texts or invites, but I’m just sad no one ever thinks “wow she’s nice I’d like to meet her again”.

Tomorrow I’ll text some of them first, ask if they would like to go get a coffee. Hope the answer won’t be “sorry I’m sick/busy today” and then they’ll never reach back to me. Please tell me I’m just silly and should reach out to them first. ",2,1731012933.0,socialskills,8,1.0,False

**Day 7: Early life and death of Goro Takemura**

You may love him, you may hate him, you may both, but either way it’s hard to deny that Takemura is a very interesting character who most likely won’t leave you indifferent to him. He’s so integrated into the story that it’s hard to imagine that ... he didn’t even exist until 2019, meaning he was created around two years before game’s release. Although the overall concept of Goro as a Corpo with a strong, traditional Japanese values, loyal to a fault to Saburo and seeking revenge on his killer, remained mostly unchanged, in such a short time his storyline went through pretty significant alterations.

The most noticeable are the ones related to his... death. We all know how it all works in the final game, basically it’s something that, as a big fan of original Deus Ex, I like to call „Paul Denton scenario”, meaning a hidden choice between doing what game’s seems to want you to do or doing what your instincts tells you, which ultimately determines the fate of a major character.

Originally however a different solution was proposed, something more similar to systems that can be observed in the crucifixion quest or Claire questline, in which the end result is affected by the dialogue options that you picked earlier, something akin to a point system. So depending on whether we questioned his blind loyalty to Arasaka at the construction site, spared Oda’s life and one more choice, it would determine whether he runs away with V from Arasaka’s ambush or not.

Honestly, this story idea was kind of absurd, since after making all the wrong choices, Takemura was going to stay and let himself be killed, because of honor... and that was like the only justification of his. So I don’t hink it would be controversial to say that the final version of this sequence makes a lot more sense.

[Ah, Takemura, just the way I remember him](https://preview.redd.it/dfsccqpqljzd1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3938008358f0003a41297e6b21c289e49ac9d1e)

Even saving him from death in this scenario wouldn’t spare him from the writer’s cruelty. While in the final game there is at least one ending that allows Goro to stay alive, originally he supposed to die even after choosing Arasaka’s path. In that version of events, Hanako was hiding everything about Saburo’s engram from V all the way up to confronting Yorinobu. Only then she was to reveal her plan to plant her father into her brother’s body. Takemura supposed to be opposed to that, believing that Saburo would never stoop so low, and he would try to stop her, only to get shot by Hanako for his troubles. Ultimately they decided to spare him, expand his role in this finale and to even include him in the Devil’s ending, which worked for the better I think.

**Now’s the time for the question**, when you played for the first time, did you managed to save Takemura or maybe you missed this possibility?

So I first moved to NYC to attend film school at NYU from 2004-2008, yet stayed in NYC until 2011. In the beginning, I only managed to score 4 dates via OkCupid, all of which went nowhere and ending with me being ghosted, which was understandable as I had hitherto no experience dating whatsoever. I was a complete dork (which I’m fine with and even take a bit of humble pride in), and only got my very first girlfriend when I was 22-years-old, which only lasted a few months. I then moved to LA in 2012, where I only dated 1 girl seriously for about 3-years (which was my longest relationship). I moved back to NYC (Williamsburg) back in early 2022, just to be closer to my parents, extended family, and old high school friends in Connecticut. Ever since then, I’ve tried OkCupid, Hinge, Coffee Meets Bagel, Bumble, and Tinder, but only scored 2 first-dates in the past 2 years. While I wasn’t ghosted by both of these women after the first date, they did let me down easy, which I appreciated, but I’ve been single ever since. 

I certainly don’t think I’m the most handsome guy in the world and am only 5’7” tall, but I do stay very fit, exercise, and eat well, and have been told a few times that I’m a good conversationalist with a chipper attitude, which is nice to hear. I work as a freelance architectural/interior design photographer, which, while not pulling in millions by any means, does allow me the freedom to pursue my own projects and craft my own schedule. Besides the standard fare of reading and watching obscure films/documentaries, my favorite activities are photographing landscapes with my large-format film camera, playing the piano (which I’ve done since I was 6-years-old), and compose abstract/impressionistic music (with manuscript paper at the piano stand, painstakingly notating in one note at a time). I adore composing and playing (especially playing anything by Liszt, Ravel, Rachmaninoff, Scriabin, Medtner, Bach, Schumann, and above all, Chopin). I’m a very good jazz pianist as well. I’m also a resolute gallery hopper and stay in the galleries around Chelsea so much that I practically live there, but it does kinda suck going to gallery after gallery alone all the time.

I’m pretty happy with myself, but life is rather lonely in NYC for me overall, even with my small coterie of friends, who don’t really date. I don’t consider myself an incel, I certainly do not hate women (or anyone else for that matter) or hold toxic views, nor do I think that I’m owed anything by anyone.

So what is it that I might be doing wrong? I’d love to hear any suggestions!

1gm0toc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gm0toc,"AIRBNB trying to contact me for a $2,000 damage reimbursement #airbnb #help ","I stayed at a place for 2 nights (Oct. 26-28) with my friends and everything was great and went smoothly up until a day after we had left the place. We had only stayed for two nights because we were attending a music festival, so the majority of the time we were out. We stayed at the airbnb mostly just to get ready for the day or to sleep. On both of those nights, my friends and I were trying to see how we could use the tv upstairs and downstairs, to watch movies or just connect our phone to any sort of entertainment. I had texted the Airbnb hosts on how to turn on the TVs because we couldn't find any remote that would be compatible with it, and she responded and said we need to use the amazon firesticks. We literally never ended up finding ANY of them and just played card games instead. Also keep in mind that the day that we left, we cleaned the place so good, and made sure to put everything back the way that it was when we first found it. We even put an effort to wash the robes they provided for us in the laundry. Because we had such a great experience at this lovely airbnb and it was a beautiful space, I was just about to write a five star review and plan another time to come back until I get a notification from my phone the next day. The next day after we left, I saw that she was trying to request a reimbursement charge for $26 because apparently there were some really tiny incense burn marks on her coffee table upstairs. She was trying to charge us for a leather repair kit for the furniture ($26). We literally didn't even burn incense on that table at all, but I was willing to pay it because I just didn't want to drag it out and honestly the charge wasn't as bad.So when I check my phone after they hosts told us that they are missing a firestick remote upstairs, and I told them that we never even got to watch TV cause we couldn't find it. But she didn't believe me. Then moments later I see that the hosts canceled their $26 reimbursement retrying to request a reimbursement for $2,039.99. $39 for the missing fire stick remote that we never got a chance to use at all and never saw it, and then $2000 to go get her coffee table reupholstered. I just didn't respond back to them, and it's been like 2 weeks and i just finally gotten like 3 missed calls from airbnb support. Help, what do I do? I feel like they're just trying to scam people out here. ",0,1731012812.0,AirBnBHosts,3,0.33,False

1gm0tgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ControversialScandals/comments/1gm0tgk/shuuble_was_in_the_wrong/,Shuuble was in the wrong,"    To start this off I am referencing the whole Wilbur Soot and Shubble scandal recently see I couldn't talk about this early on because of how fresh it was and how bad the backlash was. Let me say thisas a sort of summary I think Shubble was an asshole for what she did. I will give you my reasons for why I feel that way but firstly I want to say that while writing this I am a neutral party in this situation, I tend to look at situations like these very objectively and with as much empathy as I can but not being over empathic. So letsstrt with reason 1!♡

1. To start off I was told growing up that you should never post your personal life online and to be very careful about what you post online. I saw the effects first hand how a simple post online could ruin someone both emotionally and physically. What im saying is that what irked me at the start when the drama was still fresh was the fact that Shubble chose to do a live stream on Twitch to vent about her relationship with her ex boyfriend. I mean I get if you need to vent and talk to someone about what you went through but she had other choices she could've gone and do a message and unsent, called a friend or family, or even posted anonymously on Reddit. She had other options but decided to live stream to vent about the relationship.

2. Form what I saw she was mostly talking about his house and how dirty it was but my point being shes like 3 years older than him. Its the fact that if you dont like how someone lives you can just leave either to stay with freinds and family ( and for anyone who wants to make the argument that she wasnt in america and had no access to freinds or family she couldve stayed at a hotel or an inn im sorry but there are options or she couldve just flown back home i realize a ticket back is a lot of money but if anyone has seen that video of this kid who realized its cheaper to fly to his school rather than drive thats the point im making.) I dont want to say that the house wasnt that bad because after watching horders the TV reality show you kinda get a bit desencatized to all of it but the reality of it is that no matter how bad it was leaving is an option ( and to anyone saying that she was being verbally abused so she couldn't leave my response to that is the fact that when you stop being so sensitive to what someone is saying you kinda find that you can really just leave. For example the phrase "" Im going to kill myself if you leave me"" the normal response would be "" oh no dont do that... Ect. "" the proper response to that is "" great so im going now u wanna a dount before i leave? Coffee? Carton of cigarettes? No. Great well hope u know that this was great but would never do this again 4/10 stars. Byeee!"" and you leave. Why be sensitive about someone you dont like at some point you gotta take things like a champ and not a toddler. And to reinterate you should lack empathy im sure there going through it but whether they are or not is not YOUR prpblem. I realize that may seem insensitive but thats just the truth of it.

3. Okay so the funny thing is that most people are learning that you can get fired or even not be given a job because of the things you post online. This woman basically ruined any form of income that this man had over a relationship that she didnt like and that didnt work out l. Something that I also noticed and a lot of people go back this quote by Wilbur bit he says that we all know the carefully curated versions of him and not the real him. Mind you hes right in the sense that, thats how it is in the kind of buisness hes in and the fact that he held that idea is not wrong most people hold that value of seperation in best interest. The fact that she outeded so much of his personal life on stream and semmed to have no regrets is something i cannot fathom someone doing without any malicious intent. You cannot know something about someone talk aboit it live knowing its personal and just post it online like its your right. Like you dont have to consult someone ebfore you do this type of thing. 

Thats my three reasons why but if you want more let me know because this is getting a little long and i can only type so much before I get biased.",1,1731012796.0,ControversialScandals,0,1.0,False

I'm struggling to get my life together, I've been doing better but my relationships with people have still been hard. I grew up in an abusive home, I was manipulated, sexually assaulted, and neglected. I moved around a lot so making close friends was hard. As an adult I just went from one crappy job to another with a lot of time spent unemployed in between. I'm in a long term relationship, engaged, and im going to school trying to get my life on track and I'll graduate when I'm 30.
The main problem I'm having is that I can't seem to make friends. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, I've had a problem with it my whole life. I've gone tp therapy and I've had two therapists say the same thing ""there's something you're doing wrong, I just can't figure out what it is. Maybe it's your adhd."" And it might be adhd? I can't really afford treatment right now.  
For some context, this is how my past 4 attempts at making friends have gone:
Met a girl at a cousin's wedding, we had a good time talking, started chatting on social media, and then 2 weeks later she blocked me. I have no idea what I did. I even had my partner and another friend look at the chat, trying to figure out what I did and no one could find anything. We were laughing, having a good time, then I was blocked. 
Another attempt was with a girl from school. We met up, had coffee, she said she wanted to exchange numbers, wanted to hang out more, I said yes, then she ghosted me. There was nothing between that. She was excited, wanted to be friends, then wouldn't ever talk to me again.  
Another attempt was at a mediation group. This one girl kept staring at me and it made me uncomfortable, but I tried to talk to her and I figured maybe she was just a little awkward because she was super nice. We talked about Asian markets we've both been to, I told her about my favorite one and she asked if it was near this one highway. I told her ""I'm actually not sure, I don't drive much so I sometimes get confused where some things are in relation to others."" She rolled her eyes at me and has been aggressive towards me ever since. She's super nice to literally everyone else at the mediation group, she's just so hostile towards me. I asked my therapist about this and she said that saying I don't drive much is just a weird thing to say, but couldn't explain why and couldn't tell me why that meand this girl would be mean to me. 
Last is my sister in law. She has always insulted me and been aggressive towards me, but constantly says she thinks of us as friends. I've asked her why she insults me all the time and told her it needs to stop but she just cries and says she doesn't know what I'm talking about. Everyone really likes her, she's so sweet to everyone, except me. 
I don't know what the deal is. It's driving me crazy because I know it's something with me, my therapist even knows it's something with me, but no one can seem to figure out what. 
I do have 2 friends but one of them constantly reminds me that I don't really have anyone else so it puts me down and makes me feel weird. 
I hate this and im so uncomfortable. I dont know if I just need to let go and accept that I won't be able to make friends, but im extremely alone. My partner doesn't think anything is wrong with me, but I know they're biased...
I've had good luck with making friends with people who are a little older than me (40ish up to 70ish in age) but due to the age gap between us sometimes it's hard to make a good connection, but I really like the conversation we have. They're just not people I can text and ask to get coffee or go to a bar or something. 
I don't know what I'm hoping to get out of posting this here but I've felt lost for years. If I could have any help I'd appreciate it...",1,1731012595.0,socialskills,0,1.0,False

It sat on the worktable in front of me, wrapped in a layer of brittle, brown parchment that smelled faintly of mildew and old varnish, with a wax seal—red, chipped, official-looking—stamped on the front. *For the attention of Magdalene Driscoll,* written in the small, careful script of someone who doesn’t want their name connected to this delivery. I traced the address with my thumb, feeling a prickle of excitement.

The museum was quiet, colder than usual, with that familiar smell of dust, varnish, and the ever-present tang of metal from the displays around me. All around, cases of glass and steel stood like silent, forgotten sentinels in the dim light, each one filled with relics of another age—half-melted candle molds, tarnished sextants, peculiar tools that looked like they’d been assembled from spare parts in someone’s attic. I heard the creak of the floorboards settle and imagined the exhibits behind me listening as I worked.

A message from Tamsin had arrived earlier that day, her voice crackling over the line as if her words were being dragged through static. Tamsin held a Ph.D. in Industrial Archaeology, specializing in 19th-century mechanical innovations and esoteric technology. Her research focused on unconventional inventors who operated on the fringes of Victorian science, particularly those whose inventions blurred the lines between science, art, and the occult. She liked to call it ""studying dead men’s toys,"" which never failed to annoy purists.

""Hey, Maggie! Just wanted to give you a heads-up,"" Tamsin had said, sounding more animated than usual. ""Remember that inventor we talked about—Winslow? Well, guess what? A journal of his just surfaced, full of sketches and notes on his inventions. I thought of you right away! It's on its way over now—you’re going to love it.""

I’d laughed it off then, but now, sitting alone with the package, I felt a sliver of apprehension. The stillness pressed in as I peeled back the parchment, revealing an old leather-bound journal underneath, its edges worn and cracked. I ran my hand over the cover, which felt almost soft, as though it had been handled by a hundred hands before mine.

The first page crackled as I opened it, and a musty, almost sweet scent puffed up—a mix of faded ink, dried paper, and something else, something metallic, like old blood. My fingers tingled as I turned the page, and there, in thick, dark strokes of ink, was the name: *Ivor Winslow, 1829*.

A thrill ran through me. I’d heard of Winslow, that much was true. Tamsin and I had laughed over rumors of his work—devices that supposedly let you “see beyond the veil,” things people claimed let you peer into other realms, glimpse spirits. It was all nonsense, but this… this journal made it feel solid, real. Winslow’s words sat heavy on the page, a warning as much as an invitation.

***Journal Entry, 7th February, 1829***

*At last, I have refined the diagrams for what I now denominate The Warden’s Glass, a contrivance designed to unveil the hidden substrata beneath the human countenance; to pierce the common veil and afford a glimpse into the architecture which, I am convinced, courses beneath the surface of mortal flesh. This apparatus, if assembled to the precise specifications I have delineated, may permit the wearer to behold not merely the tissue of our corporeal form but that elusive quintessence which lingers therein, half-visible yet wholly inscrutable.*

*The device itself demands the placement of two primary lenses—one convex, one concave—set within a brass frame that holds them at a separation exact to a quarter of an inch; such a distance has proven critical, for without it, the apparatus serves merely to magnify the mere superficies, yielding naught but an ordinary amplification. My initial trials, I regret to note, yielded only this, much to my chagrin; I shall not soon forget the unfortunate episode involving the dissection of a housecat, whose secrets were, alas, not laid bare by the preliminary lenses.*

*Further, I have introduced a third lens, set obliquely, and treated with a thin coating of silver nitrate—a substance which, I surmise, shall act as a filter for those more spectral elements which lie dormant to the unassisted eye. This treatment, I hypothesize, shall lend to the viewer a rarefied perception, one that transcends the bounds of mere organic scrutiny and hints at the immaterial. I have yet to comprehend fully the nature of this spectral substratum, though in prior observations, I have beheld faint vapours—fleeting emanations—particularly around those in the final throes of life, and, in one instance, upon a cadaver but hours deceased.*

*Yet, even as I commit these particulars to paper, there emerges within me a sensation not solely of elation but of something altogether more severe, as if some primeval warning lingers at the fringes of consciousness. The phrase, To see what lives beneath, haunts my thoughts incessantly, suggesting more than mere flesh or sinew; it alludes to an uncharted realm that may lie upon the precipice of the observable, awaiting its own dreadful unveiling.*

*There remains upon this very page a faint smear, left from an earlier accident in the course of the experiment; it is a smudge of blood, thin and dried, mingled with the residue of silver nitrate—a token, as it were, of the very boundary I seek to cross. Blood, yes; yet blood is but the beginning, the primal fluid from which my investigations must spring, leading me down that path where substance yields, finally, to essence.*

*To-morrow, I shall resume these trials, urged forth by a conviction both unrelenting and yet laced with apprehension, as though bound by some spectral thread; it tugs, invisible yet undeniable, drawing me onward into shadows where no man has ventured and whence no man may return unscathed.*

I turned the page, feeling the brittle edge scratch lightly against my thumb; a faint itch surfaced at the bridge of my nose, and I scratched it absently, my eyes falling once more upon Winslow’s neat, precise script. The ink looked darker here, almost oily, sinking into the parchment with an unsettling intensity. The next entry lay before me, waiting. I took a steadying breath.

***Journal Entry, 15th February, 1829***

*The apparatus, now augmented with certain modifications, has yielded the most extraordinary results; indeed, what I have observed may strain credulity, yet it must be recorded with the utmost fidelity, for the sake of both science and posterity. Upon this day, I dared to engage The Warden’s Glass upon a human subject—none other than myself—and thus set forth to test whether my theories held substance or were mere phantasmagoria borne of fevered ambition.*

*At first, there was naught but an unsettling disquiet, as if I had peered through a dense mist; shapes appeared, nebulous and indistinct, floating at the periphery of vision. I adjusted the lenses with trembling fingers, aligning them precisely; a curious vertigo ensued, a spinning sensation, brief yet palpable, as though I had plummeted from some great height within my very soul.*

*Then, as the vertigo subsided, I beheld—oh, how shall I describe it?—an apparition, not wholly human, but a shade of myself, clinging to the contours of my face, my hands, my form; it seemed a dark mirror of flesh, pale as death, as though some ghastly double had emerged from within, lurking beneath the skin. There were my eyes, yet hollowed and glistening with a malign intelligence not my own; there were my hands, twisted and elongated, as if stretched by unseen forces to an unnatural shape. This other self regarded me with an expression so dark, so hideously knowing, that a thrill of terror ran through my frame.*

*Yet, the spectacle did not end here; the vision grew stranger, still more grotesque, and I perceived upon my limbs faint trails—pale, winding veins—pulsing not with the warmth of blood but with a thin, sickly light; it traced across my skin as though some inner fire burned weakly within, struggling for release. These veins converged upon my heart, which throbbed visibly beneath the Glass, as if yearning to break free of its bony cage. Indeed, I swear I saw it, my heart itself, beating with a sickly rhythm and tinged with a hue I dare not name; it seemed a creature alive unto itself, malicious, hungry, and ever-watchful.*

*Such was the horror of this vision that I was compelled to tear the Glass from my face, lest I descend fully into madness. My breath came in short, gasping bursts, my hands numb with fright; it was as though I had glimpsed some heretofore hidden world, one that exists beneath our every waking moment, unknown to us, and yet profoundly, horribly real.*

*I write these words with trembling hand, for I know not what next I shall uncover should I continue these trials; yet I am driven by a force I scarcely comprehend, an unquenchable thirst to understand the dark inner workings of our being. There is something—some force or essence—that dwells within each of us, some shadow-self that lurks beyond perception, ever present, and I am determined to unearth it, though it cost me my reason, or my very soul.*

*Tomorrow, I shall endeavor to increase the refractive power of the lenses, to deepen the magnification, and perhaps unveil that which lies even further beneath; for there are layers upon layers yet unexplored, and I feel compelled to venture into these unfathomed depths, however treacherous they may prove.*

*May these notes serve as testament to my efforts, and as a warning to any who may follow; for there is, I suspect, a price to such knowledge, one that has already begun its dark toll upon me.*

I checked my watch—10:42 p.m. Just about time to pack up, call it a night and head home. That was the logical thing to do, of course, but the thought came and went like smoke, barely registering. I was stuck here, rooted to the spot with the journal practically pulling me in. The brittle pages caught the dim light in a way that dared me to leave it unfinished, to abandon Winslow and whatever strange things he’d uncovered. Instead, I turned another page, my pulse picking up.

My eyes landed on his sketches, meticulous and exact. He’d drawn out the *Warden’s Glass*—lenses sketched in sharp detail, measurements scrawled along the sides like the work of a man in a hurry. Below were lists of chemical compounds he’d tried, with a line or two about their “effects on perception,” in a mix of English and Latin that seemed to straddle the line between science and something close to mysticism. 

**Tinctura Salis Nitri**

* **Description**: A tincture derived from purified *sal nitrum* (saltpeter), thrice distilled in a copper alembic; proportioned as 3 drams saltpeter to 1 drachm copper. Purported to “steady the pulse and prepare the nerves for heightened vision.”
* **Dosage**: 12 drops, administered upon the tongue ere the handling of the *Warden’s Glass*.
* **Observation**: “Observed upon trial—a mild clarity of thought, yet tingling persists at the extremities. Requires further refinement.”
* **Latin Notation**: *Per visum maiorem, sed cum tremore* (For greater sight, but with trembling).

**Vapor Mercurii Sublimati in Vinum Plumbum**

* **Description**: A mist derived from calomel (mercury chloride) vapor, suspended in lead-infused wine at a ratio of 2:1 (wine to calomel); believed to “illuminate hidden recesses within the flesh.”

Winslow’s notes showed a fervor that bordered on obsession; he outlined doses, mixtures, ratios, specifics so precise they were almost unnerving. The parchment held dark stains—residue from his experiments, or maybe just the ink reacting to the years.

Then I hit the next entry, and immediately, the tone shifted. The ink was darker, almost pressed into the paper with a weight that practically dripped frustration—or fear. I took a breath, feeling a chill creep up my arms, and read on.

***Journal Entry, 22nd February, 1829***

*It is with great dismay, mingled with some measure of indignation, that I pen today’s account, for my recent revelations concerning the Warden’s Glass have met with scorn and derision among those I once counted as both colleagues and friends. The very mention of my observations—the vision of that dark being, that infernal double I beheld through the lens—was met with laughter, outright mirth, as if I were a common charlatan recounting tales of phantoms and spirits to gullible children. Even Dr. Abner Hollis, whom I had regarded as a mind of singular curiosity, dismissed my findings as fanciful delusion, urging me to “rest” and “let the fever pass.”*

*There is but one, Mr. Roderick Elwood, whose ear was inclined toward my words with more than passing interest; indeed, he listened as I recounted my ordeal with a silent intensity, his gaze fixed, thoughtful, as though he too had once glimpsed into some dark crevice of the soul. Mr. Elwood, a fellow student of optics and physiology, is a man of sober mind and unyielding curiosity; he has spent many years in the examination of light and refraction, often proposing theories both strange and inspired, yet rooted always in science and logic. At my behest, he agreed to come to my laboratory, to view himself through the Warden’s Glass and see if my account held merit.*

*Upon his arrival, I noted a strange solemnity upon his countenance, as though he approached some sacred rite. I placed the Glass in his hands, noting with satisfaction his careful grip upon the device, his movements precise and respectful, for he understood the nature of invention, of risk. When he at last held the lenses before his eyes, I waited, scarcely daring to breathe, as he peered into his own reflection, his gaze unwavering.*

*Yet, as the moments passed, his expression remained impassive, unmoved; indeed, his features betrayed no trace of horror nor recognition of that shadow-self I had glimpsed so vividly. At length, he removed the Glass and regarded me with a bemused smile, expressing no horror, no dread, but instead a mild disappointment; he claimed to have seen nothing untoward, nothing to suggest the “revelations” I had described with such fervor. He suggested, perhaps too kindly, that my vision had been the product of fatigue or nervous excitation, and recommended I abandon the apparatus for a time, lest it lead me further astray.*

*This revelation—this failure—has left me at once baffled and resentful, for it suggests that the Glass reveals not to all but only to certain eyes, or perhaps certain souls.*

*I am loath to abandon my inquiries, for in them I sense some deeper truth—a truth both terrible and irrevocable. Tomorrow, I shall proceed with another trial, perhaps upon a third party or upon some creature devoid of reason, that I may discern whether this apparition is unique to me alone. Let this entry serve as both testament and warning, for should my findings reveal some singular corruption within my person, I know not what end awaits me, save one of horror.*

I really should’ve been heading home by now; this journal wasn’t paying my overtime. Winslow’s journal had me in a strange grip, as if the lines of ink themselves were threads, winding tighter and tighter around me. I pulled the lamp closer, allowing the warm pool of light to spill across the worn pages, and I turned to the next entry with a growing sense of anticipation.

***Journal Entry, 24th February, 1829***

*To any who might follow my steps through these pages, let this entry serve as a testament to the precarious and beguiling path upon which I now tread. Today, I conducted my latest trial with the Warden’s Glass, and I am yet shaken by the result, unable to decide if the vision I beheld is truth or some horrid delusion crafted by a fevered mind.*

*Having resolved to test the apparatus upon another, I enlisted the company of Mr. Leopold Grant—a figure of some notoriety within the town and not unfamiliar to those versed in local gossip. Accused, albeit never convicted, of unspeakable acts against a woman and child, Grant remains a shadowed presence in our community, a man cloaked in accusations, though no judge’s gavel has ever fallen against him. Despite his standing, I confess a fascination with his intellect, for he speaks with an eloquence that belies the baser rumors surrounding him; his discourse is, in fact, often compelling, with insights that I might describe as mordant, even penetrating, if not for the faint whiff of arrogance which always accompanies his speech.*

*Mr. Grant is a man of many convictions, particularly in matters of social order and the so-called ""rights"" of mankind. He regards the world, as he put it in our discussions today, as “a vast tapestry wherein each thread is not woven by man, but dictated by nature’s own hand.” A peculiar view, yet I found myself reluctantly compelled by his arguments, for he spoke with such fervor on the inherent hierarchy of all living beings, on the natural superiority of the “enlightened few,” that for a moment, I found myself nodding in unthinking assent. It is a view, I must admit, that grows more common in our age—this conviction that certain men are fated for greatness, while others are destined to serve. Such beliefs disturb me; yet, in Mr. Grant’s company, I confess I felt strangely willing to listen.*

*It was with no small sense of foreboding, therefore, that I handed him the Warden’s Glass, knowing his nature but curious to observe if he, too, might glimpse his inner form as I had. I prepared a dose of Tinctura Salis Nitri, administering twelve drops upon his tongue precisely as prescribed. He accepted the tincture without protest, though I noted his lip curled slightly at the bitterness; still, his gaze remained fixed upon the Glass with a peculiar intensity, as though he anticipated some spectacle or revelation unique to himself.*

*At last, he held the lenses to his eyes, his features poised in cold anticipation. I watched him carefully, scarcely daring to breathe as he peered into his reflection, his gaze unwavering, his form statuesque, and his lips set into a thin line of contemplation. The silence stretched between us, thick as a shroud, and I waited for some flicker of recognition to pass over his face.*

*But it was I—not he—who beheld the horror.*

*Through the Glass, I caught sight of his reflection, twisted and blackened, a shadow-self that I dare scarcely describe; for in his visage I beheld not mere flesh, but a mask of malice, as if his inner being had warped his features into a grotesque semblance of humanity. His eyes, dark as pitch, seemed to absorb the light, drawing it inward to feed some monstrous emptiness within; his mouth curled into a smile, but it was a grimace of hollow triumph, a sneer stretched tight as if over bone. The flesh about his throat bore dark lines, winding like chains, as though some inner violence had left its imprint upon his very spirit.*

*I struggled to remain calm, to keep my face impassive, though every nerve in my body urged me to recoil. Mr. Grant lowered the Glass, glancing toward me with a faint expression of curiosity. “Is all well, Mr. Winslow?” he inquired, his voice low and untroubled. For a moment, I stood rooted to the spot, fighting the urge to confess the vision that had chilled me to my marrow.*

*But no words came. Instead, I forced a smile—weak, strained—and assured him all was well, that the Glass was simply an instrument, nothing more. He seemed satisfied with my answer, his mouth twitching into that familiar, unsettling smirk as he handed the Glass back to me, remarking idly that he “had hoped to see something truly remarkable.”*

*And thus, I let him go, saying nothing, betraying nothing, though my mind shrieked with horror at what I had beheld. I should have told him, should have confessed my vision, for he deserves, at the very least, to know the depths of his own corruption; yet, perhaps cowardice or some lingering fascination stayed my tongue. Even now, I cannot shake the image from my mind, nor can I fathom why the Glass should reveal such horrors to my eyes alone.*

I stifled a yawn, rubbing my eyes and reminding myself that any sensible person would’ve left hours ago. But here I was, still anchored to Winslow’s strange, unsettling world. I’d gotten used to this, I suppose—staying long after everyone else had clocked out, losing myself in archives and journals, just as I’d done back in grad school. My old study partners used to make fun of me for it, always the last one hunched over some musty old book while they grabbed drinks. But they’d gotten lazy after a few years; most of them were happily cataloging exhibits or doing desk work now, their curiosity worn down to a dull nub. Maybe I wasn’t exactly Miss Popular, but if that’s what they thought it took to be “likable,” I didn’t care.

I flipped to the next page, feeling the spine shift strangely beneath my fingers—a bit heavier than the rest, a peculiar thickness at the back that I hadn’t noticed until now. I pressed a little, thinking I’d feel something odd beneath the leather cover, but nothing seemed amiss. Just the pages and that sense of old weight, dense and ominous in a way I couldn’t quite explain. Maybe it was just my mind playing tricks on me, tired as I was, but it felt like the journal itself was pressing back, heavier somehow the deeper I got into Winslow’s entries.

Leaning into the lamp’s glow, I turned the page. The flicker of the light seemed to make the ink shift on the page, as though his words were still wet, fresh and almost alive. I took a breath, pushed my glasses up my nose, and read on, drawn in by that same strange, nagging pull.

***Journal Entry, 10th March, 1829***

*A fortnight has passed since the night of Mr. Leopold Grant’s visit, and I find myself gripped by an unease that no science nor rational philosophy can dispel. The Glass, in its cold and indifferent clarity, has revealed a dreadful truth—one I had, until now, successfully cloaked in the comfort of denial. Leopold’s visage, that foul, contorted shade I glimpsed, was no fleeting mirage; it was, I am convinced, a manifestation of his true essence, made visible to me alone.*

*Yet, how did I fail to heed the warnings? The rumors of his alleged misdeeds have lingered about him for years, staining his reputation like a faint shadow one might dismiss in passing, but which clings persistently to the air. There were whispers of a woman, a child—of lives cut short by a silent hand and buried by the cruelty of indifference. He eluded judgment, defended by technicalities and the absence of witnesses, and emerged unscathed in the eyes of the law. And here I was, deceived by his charming eloquence, his wit, even his mind, so coldly rational yet disturbingly vibrant. It sickens me to think that I too might have been charmed into silence, lulled into complacency by my own foolishness.*

*No longer, however, will I rest on such foolish conceits. I have devised a plan to expose the truth, to force this revelation upon the eyes of others who, like myself, have failed to see the wolf among us. I shall host an evening gathering at my own residence, an affair of unusual festivity; and I shall invite a select company—those men and women I deem most respected within our society. This will be a congregation of the learned, the curious, and those of firmest moral standing, for I must secure witnesses of unquestionable judgment; only then can the weight of Leopold’s corruption be laid bare for all to behold.*

*I shall prepare carefully, extending invitations to each guest with utmost discretion, lest the nature of my purpose be misconstrued. I have chosen them with utmost care; there is Dr. Abner Hollis, once a friend, whose skeptical eyes may lend credence to the spectacle I shall unveil, though he regards me now, I believe, with disdain. There is Mrs. Lavinia Crawley, a woman of high social standing, outwardly prim yet keen for the private scandal; perhaps she will delight in the unmasking of our mutual friend. Mr. Edward Salloway shall be among them, a man of inflexible conviction and a strict adherent to logic, whose presence shall serve as a bulwark against any claims of exaggeration or hysteria. And there is Miss Eleanor Finch, an artist of prodigious skill, whose temperament is both studious and unafraid, a woman with a keen eye for shadow.*

*The invitations have been sent, and I have taken pains to craft them in a manner both cordial and mysterious, hinting at a grand spectacle which might arouse their curiosity. Though I am seldom one to host gatherings, I trust that the unusual nature of this event, combined with their intrigue in my scientific pursuits, shall draw them here.*

***17th March, 1829***

*The night of the gathering has come and gone, and I am yet in a state of agitation, a turmoil so profound I scarcely know how to order my thoughts upon this page.*

*They arrived in finery, exchanging pleasantries in the candlelit corridors of my home; I greeted each with cordiality, concealing the quiet dread that gnawed at the edge of my mind. Leopold was among the last to arrive, sauntering in with that insufferable air of familiarity, as though he and I were kin of the closest order. He clasped my hand, a broad, arrogant smile spread across his face, and I felt a shudder seize me, an impulse to pull away, to banish him from my sight; yet I smiled, swallowing the disgust that welled within me.*

*Wine flowed freely, and soon laughter and the low hum of conversation filled the rooms; yet beneath it all, a tension simmered, invisible to all but myself. I waited until the hour was late and their spirits sufficiently loosened before making my suggestion—that we adjourn to the lower chambers where my laboratory lay, for I had “a marvel” to show them.*

*They laughed, teased me as expected, yet curiosity won out, and they followed, descending into the dimly lit room where my apparatus awaited. The laboratory was arranged with deliberate care: the Warden’s Glass rested upon a velvet-draped pedestal, surrounded by vials and tinctures whose oils glimmered faintly in the gaslight, casting shadows that flickered against the walls. I had prepared the room as one might a stage, each object meticulously placed, each light angled to create an atmosphere both scientific and foreboding.*

*One by one, I offered them the Salis Nitri, observing with satisfaction as each obligingly took a measured dose; I administered the preparations carefully, precisely as before, knowing that any deviation might compromise the outcome. As each guest took their turn peering into the Glass, I noted with relief that their reflections remained untainted, their forms unchanged; they laughed, finding nothing to remark upon save for a faint dizziness from the tincture’s effects.*

*Finally, it was Leopold’s turn. Yet no sooner had I extended the vial than he declined, laughing as he waved it away. “I have tasted your draught once, Winslow,” he jested, “and I see little need to subject myself again.” His voice, dripping with casual insolence, made my blood pound hotly, yet I forced myself to maintain composure, coaxing him with gentle persistence. He continued to resist, and the others began to laugh at my insistence, though I sensed a flicker of hesitation in his eyes—a trace of something that only deepened my resolve.*

*Before I could press further, a clumsy guest—young Mr. Pettinger, the son of a local magistrate and entirely inebriated—stumbled forward, declaring his eagerness to try the experiment once more. His heavy hand caught the edge of the pedestal; the Glass, my creation, my only means of revealing the truth, toppled to the floor with a sickening crash. In an instant, it shattered, shards of glass scattering across the stone, reflecting a dozen fractured images of my horrified face.*

*Rage surged within me, a torrent so fierce I feared it might consume me utterly. I scarcely remember how I ushered them out, my voice tight, my gestures sharp and unkind. Leopold gave me one last smirk as he left, a look that seared itself into my mind, mocking me, taunting me with the knowledge he had escaped yet again. As the door closed behind the last of them, I stood alone in the darkened room, staring at the remnants of my work, a hollow emptiness settling within me.*

*Yet beneath the emptiness, a darker impulse stirs, a heat that I cannot ignore. I find my mind drifting to thoughts of vengeance, to the image of my hands wrapped around a throat, squeezing, feeling the life drain slowly away. I see it as clearly as I see the room before me: Leopold’s face, contorted in shock, in pain, in horror as I exact upon him the justice he has evaded for too long.*

I closed the journal with a slow, steadying breath, feeling that prickling chill on the back of my neck, the kind that keeps its hold long after the lights go on. Winslow’s words were a trap I was willingly stepping into, deeper and deeper with every page. My shift had ended ages ago—but the idea of going home felt so…trivial. The museum was empty, quiet, and as always during these hours - rare as they are besides occasions such as this one - I liked it that way. The silence wrapped around me like a wool coat, somehow making Winslow’s twisted little world feel all the more real.

I got up, stretched, and wandered down the dim corridors, looking at the exhibits I’d walked past hundreds of times without a second thought. There were glass cases of polished brass instruments, faded maps, and fragments of machines that once hummed and clanked in some distant past, their usefulness as dead as their makers. Some pieces reminded me of that strange mix of people you meet in school—the ones who can’t leave the past alone, whose lives revolve around dusty artifacts, more comfortable with objects than with people. I’d been one of those, too. Still was, I guess.

I thought about the things Winslow had written, the strange way he seemed so formal, so poised, even while talking about horrific things. And yet, the cold detachment didn’t make it any less unsettling; if anything, it made him sound even more unhinged. Like he saw the world through a lens the rest of us weren’t privy to, and that lens wasn’t showing him anything pleasant.

Funny, though. The more I read, the more I could almost understand him. Winslow was someone you’d see wandering the library stacks at university, the one who barely looked at you, who muttered to himself like no one else was there. I’d known people like that. Hell, I’d *been* people like that. Lost in their work, their little pockets of esoteric knowledge, and wrapped so tightly in themselves they couldn’t connect with anyone else. Not that I’d had a huge circle of friends to begin with. They’d called me abrasive, prickly, or “too blunt.” Like that was somehow my problem.

But I’d never cared for the small talk, the endless cups of coffee over gossip about professors or breakups. Too many of them were just waiting for life to get started, like there was some grand event right around the corner. I’d found comfort in the straightforward nature of things like this museum. Artifacts don’t disappoint; they just…are. Just like Winslow’s journal, fixed and constant in its quiet horror.

I wandered past an old brass astrolabe, its darkened surface polished smooth by god knows how many hands, and caught a glimpse of myself reflected in the glass—a little older, maybe, and definitely tired, but the same me that stared back at people a little too directly. 

My mind wandered back to Winslow’s “*Nitre Tincture*” and the mad certainty in his words as he described his plan. The image of his guests in the cold light of his laboratory, not knowing they were about to witness something…something awful. I could almost picture him, adjusting the Glass with one hand, trying to hide his disgust for Leopold with the other. The man had ambition, I’d give him that. And even though he was bordering on deranged, there was something satisfying in seeing him out to prove everyone wrong. That sense of triumph over the ones who doubt you, who turn up their noses at what you know.

After a while, I made my way back to the journal, a little clearer, ready to get lost in it again.

***Journal Entry, 29th March, 1829***

*The deed is done; there is no turning back now, and I write this account with hands steadied by grim purpose. Leopold Grant is dead—by my own hand, and by methods as precise and deliberate as any experiment. I have, at last, silenced the monster within him, though I am aware that in doing so, I may have awakened the same within myself.*

*I encountered him alone, in the shrouded hours between night and dawn, when the streets are silent and only shadows bear witness. I had observed his habits with meticulous care; he often took solitary walks at that hour, basking, no doubt, in the certainty of his impunity. I had prepared my tools—the tinctures and powders that would ensure a swift yet undeniable end, items familiar to my hand but now turned to a darker purpose.*

*Approaching him, I offered my cordial greeting, concealing within it the cold malice that had festered in my heart. He returned my address with that same smugness, that insufferable smile; and yet, even as he spoke, his words rang hollow to my ears. I felt as though the world had narrowed to the beat of his pulse, to the delicate arch of his throat, to the faint gleam of his breath hanging in the air. There, under that shadowed lamplight, I pressed the vial to his lips, insisting it was a draft to ease “the malaise of the spirit.” Ever arrogant, he accepted it without question, swallowing my poison as if it were merely another trifling amusement.*

*The effects were swift, as I knew they would be; his eyes widened, his hand clutched his chest, and he fell to his knees, gasping for air that would no longer serve him. I watched, transfixed, as he convulsed, the once-powerful limbs now twitching feebly, his voice reduced to a mere whimper. The darkness consumed him, and I observed each stage of his passing with a dispassion that frightened me more deeply than the act itself; it was as if I had stepped beyond mere morality, into a realm where justice was the only law.*

*I write these words not from guilt, for I feel none, but from a strange, lingering satisfaction. I have succeeded where the law and society failed. Let this entry stand as testament; he has paid for his sins in kind, and I, though damned, feel a purity in my actions, as though I have struck a balance between the shadows of this world and the light.*

I dropped the journal, my hands suddenly cold, trembling as if I’d touched something forbidden, unholy. Winslow’s words echoed in my mind—a confession. Cold-blooded, calculated murder. This journal wasn’t just a record of experiments; it was his dark, twisted diary, and I’d just read his final, damning entry.

As the book hit the table, something slipped out from between the pages, landing with a soft thud. A flat object, wrapped in parchment. So that’s what had been causing that strange weight shift. I hesitated, heart pounding, before reaching for it. I slid it out from the parchment, cautiously peeling back the layers as it began to glint under the light—a piece of glass, clear but with an almost unnatural shimmer.

Then it struck me. This wasn’t just any piece of glass. It was *the* Glass, a shard of Winslow’s infamous *Warden’s Glass*. Somehow, he’d saved a fragment, hidden it here. But why? He’d never intended for the journal to be found, or did he? Was this some deranged message left for anyone who might stumble upon it? A tool for... what exactly?

As I held it up, the glint caught my eye, refracting the light, casting odd reflections across the walls. I squinted, adjusting it, when something shifted in the glass. I blinked, my mind insisting I was seeing things, but there it was—a faint, twisted image staring back at me. My own face, but… wrong. My features were there, yes, but warped, malevolent, a grotesque reflection filled with a cold, wicked intelligence that wasn’t mine.

I gasped, dropping the glass instinctively; it sliced across my finger as it fell, and a sharp sting brought me back to reality. I watched in silence as a single drop of blood slid down my fingertip, hitting the table with a soft splatter. My breath hitched, relieved it hadn’t splashed onto the journal, as though preserving Winslow’s final words mattered more than the thin line of red beginning to stain my skin.

For a long moment, I just stood there, staring down at the shard on the floor. That face I’d seen—had it been my imagination? Or had Winslow left this glass behind intentionally, some silent invitation to see what he’d seen?",1,1731012417.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False
1gm0o8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1gm0o8a/fellow_busytype_a_women_have_you_ever_chilled_out/,"Fellow Busy/Type A Women - Have You Ever ""Chilled Out"" to Find Relationship Success?","Pretty much the post, but for context, I wrote recently in r/datingoverthirty about trying to figure out active dating as a fairly social 33-year old woman in a major city. The tl;dr was that I really love dating that involves a lot of activities, fun, etc. b/c that mirrors my life. I have a full-time remote job, and as a result, a lot of flexible time that allows me to do quite a bit as a high-capacity person with a decent amount of disposable income. I have three part-time gigs to fund travel/hobbies, volunteer in the schools, am on the board of an advocacy organization, mentor youth in my sport, and train for ultra-endurance events. I also see my family regularly, have a pet, and travel frequently.

Not saying any of this to brag, but to try to illustrate why I've found recent dating difficult and what to do about it. I calendar every single week and leave open space for dates, which has always worked fine in super early dating, but as things progress, I notice that it's tricky to maintain a good balance with men who seem less structured/more freeform.

I try hard to filter out people who are easily overwhelmed, but I also seem to consistently attract men that are excited or impressed by my lifestyle only to then get overwhelmed 2-6 months later. I am extremely happy with my adventurous, chaotic life. It would be nice to have a partner who organically meshed with this lifestyle, but I find that even people who do similar things are way less structured about it than I am (ex., dating someone in my run club, but they 'wake up and run if they feel like it,' vs. I have committed to the run and wake up early to eat ahead of time, have coffee, stretch...lol) I would ultimately like to be more flexible, b/c I understand that relationships require that, but it's hard to know when you're giving up your values/passions for the hopes of someone that may not even work out. 

I haven't had much luck finding people who are involved to the degree that I am, but I also am open to the idea that I'm more looking for someone to balance me out vs. another super involved person. But I've noticed that even though I feel I'm ""making time"" for dating, many men have seemed to want more flexibility and open scheduling than I am used to. This leaves me wondering if I should start clearing out my life to ""make space"" for more dating. Some of that happens naturally in winter/off-season, but then there's an awkward ramping up in springtime. I am scared to let things go just for the potential that a man might be ""worth it"", and even then, scared that I'll be letting go of things that ultimately keep me well and make me a decent person to be around.

For background, I was in a very tumultuous LTR with a person who was dealing with depression and alcoholism in the pandemic. I picked up a lot of these hobbies and activities in 2021-22 to cope with both the difficulty of enjoying time with them and my own tendency towards depression. After a pretty intense breakup and eight-month rebound relationship, I'm genuinely working on dating for something that I could sustain long-term.

What I'm discovering through connecting with different men, reflecting on my late-stage experiences with my ex, and the feedback I got on my Reddit post is that I might be ""doing too much"" for most men. I've ""gotten in trouble"" for, for example, planning a date on a Friday night and then needing to be up at 5 AM on Saturday morning to work a gig or go for a long run. To me personally, spending an entire evening together + falling asleep together is a ""lot of quality time."" But I'm finding that a lot of men I've met and been with feel shortchanged or frustrated by this.

For example, I decided to break it off with the person I was most recently seeing b/c he could not plan dates in advance, which is crucial for me. He would frequently ask day-of to ""hang out"", which was frustrating b/c 1) I enjoy activity dates and don't like hanging out with men I'm newly seeing and 2) I almost always had a plan already made, even if the plan was ""chill in the epsom salt bath and watch Netflix with candles"" He admitted that he struggled with advanced planning, but also said that ""I felt squeezed in between your schedule"". My ex sent me a tirade after we broke up saying ""I slowly felt edged out by the Everything Else of your life: the podcasts, run groups, endurance events, nutritional supplements, athletic literature, work stuff, work trips, second jobs, volunteering activities, et cetera."" (The nutritional supplements piece always makes me laugh lol).

Long story short, I'm wondering what other similar women have done. Has anyone quit activities/roles to have more open space for dating? Has anyone found value in just chilling TF out, even if it's not in your nature? Do you just date other highly structured people? Or find men who don't mind having boundaries around dates/planned activities. Any advice welcomed, I feel truly lost and like I'm constantly the problem.",1,1731012412.0,AskWomenOver30,0,1.0,False

We were leaving today when I over heard a few of them laughing about them putting a dead bird on my tool cart ( this is my own personal tool cart that I bought it's an off brand knack armor cart that locks so no one would fuck with my stuff lmaooo how stupid of me ) 

Anyways I don't fucking like dead animals and this isn't the first time something like this has happened.
 I had no idea they did it this time tho . I don't know exactly when they did it which completely sucks because I've been touching my cart , touching my face , my coffee cup , my nose and eyes , like what in the absolute fuck. 

I was at school Friday and Monday because Im an apprentice still . My grandma was in the hospital Tuesday and I'm her prime/only care taker so I was gone for 3 day in total.  pretty sure that's when they had to have done it . Which its already stressful and scary taking an elderly loved one to the hospital. Not only that but missing work in a career with no sick days , vacation days , or PTO .  

When I got back Wednesday one guy even told me "" oh you missed it they found a dead bird in one on the water buckets"" 

Like you gotta be shitting me right now 

Last time they pushed my cart in to a ROTTING duck . I'm talking foul , rank , ass dead duck that was in a far off corner near nothing and nobody. 

I think I owe myself to give a good revenge on them but I know it'll just make my life so much worse.

1gm0kzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gm0kzq/museum_files_of_the_arcane_the_wardens_glass/,Museum Files of the Arcane: The Warden's Glass,"The package was heavier than I expected. It sat on the worktable in front of me, wrapped in a layer of brittle, brown parchment that smelled faintly of mildew and old varnish, with a wax seal—red, chipped, official-looking—stamped on the front. *For the attention of Magdalene Driscoll,* written in the small, careful script of someone who doesn’t want their name connected to this delivery. I traced the address with my thumb, feeling a prickle of excitement.

The museum was quiet, colder than usual, with that familiar smell of dust, varnish, and the ever-present tang of metal from the displays around me. All around, cases of glass and steel stood like silent, forgotten sentinels in the dim light, each one filled with relics of another age—half-melted candle molds, tarnished sextants, peculiar tools that looked like they’d been assembled from spare parts in someone’s attic. I heard the creak of the floorboards settle and imagined the exhibits behind me listening as I worked.

A message from Tamsin had arrived earlier that day, her voice crackling over the line as if her words were being dragged through static. Tamsin held a Ph.D. in Industrial Archaeology, specializing in 19th-century mechanical innovations and esoteric technology. Her research focused on unconventional inventors who operated on the fringes of Victorian science, particularly those whose inventions blurred the lines between science, art, and the occult. She liked to call it ""studying dead men’s toys,"" which never failed to annoy purists.

""Hey, Maggie! Just wanted to give you a heads-up,"" Tamsin had said, sounding more animated than usual. ""Remember that inventor we talked about—Winslow? Well, guess what? A journal of his just surfaced, full of sketches and notes on his inventions. I thought of you right away! It's on its way over now—you’re going to love it.""

I’d laughed it off then, but now, sitting alone with the package, I felt a sliver of apprehension. The stillness pressed in as I peeled back the parchment, revealing an old leather-bound journal underneath, its edges worn and cracked. I ran my hand over the cover, which felt almost soft, as though it had been handled by a hundred hands before mine.

The first page crackled as I opened it, and a musty, almost sweet scent puffed up—a mix of faded ink, dried paper, and something else, something metallic, like old blood. My fingers tingled as I turned the page, and there, in thick, dark strokes of ink, was the name: *Ivor Winslow, 1829*.

A thrill ran through me. I’d heard of Winslow, that much was true. Unlike the textbook names of other inventors, though, Winslow was known only to a select few—a shadowy figure referenced in half-forgotten papers and obscure footnotes among those in the field. Tamsin and I had laughed over rumors of his work—devices that supposedly let you “see beyond the veil,” things people claimed let you peer into other realms, glimpse spirits. It was all nonsense, but this… this journal made it feel solid, real. Winslow’s words sat heavy on the page, a warning as much as an invitation.

***Journal Entry, 7th February, 1829***

*At last, I have refined the diagrams for what I now denominate The Warden’s Glass, a contrivance designed to unveil the hidden substrata beneath the human countenance; to pierce the common veil and afford a glimpse into the architecture which, I am convinced, courses beneath the surface of mortal flesh. This apparatus, if assembled to the precise specifications I have delineated, may permit the wearer to behold not merely the tissue of our corporeal form but that elusive quintessence which lingers therein, half-visible yet wholly inscrutable.*

*The device itself demands the placement of two primary lenses—one convex, one concave—set within a brass frame that holds them at a separation exact to a quarter of an inch; such a distance has proven critical, for without it, the apparatus serves merely to magnify the mere superficies, yielding naught but an ordinary amplification. My initial trials, I regret to note, yielded only this, much to my chagrin; I shall not soon forget the unfortunate episode involving the dissection of a housecat, whose secrets were, alas, not laid bare by the preliminary lenses.*

*Further, I have introduced a third lens, set obliquely, and treated with a thin coating of silver nitrate—a substance which, I surmise, shall act as a filter for those more spectral elements which lie dormant to the unassisted eye. This treatment, I hypothesize, shall lend to the viewer a rarefied perception, one that transcends the bounds of mere organic scrutiny and hints at the immaterial. I have yet to comprehend fully the nature of this spectral substratum, though in prior observations, I have beheld faint vapours—fleeting emanations—particularly around those in the final throes of life, and, in one instance, upon a cadaver but hours deceased.*

*Yet, even as I commit these particulars to paper, there emerges within me a sensation not solely of elation but of something altogether more severe, as if some primeval warning lingers at the fringes of consciousness. The phrase, To see what lives beneath, haunts my thoughts incessantly, suggesting more than mere flesh or sinew; it alludes to an uncharted realm that may lie upon the precipice of the observable, awaiting its own dreadful unveiling.*

*There remains upon this very page a faint smear, left from an earlier accident in the course of the experiment; it is a smudge of blood, thin and dried, mingled with the residue of silver nitrate—a token, as it were, of the very boundary I seek to cross. Blood, yes; yet blood is but the beginning, the primal fluid from which my investigations must spring, leading me down that path where substance yields, finally, to essence.*

*To-morrow, I shall resume these trials, urged forth by a conviction both unrelenting and yet laced with apprehension, as though bound by some spectral thread; it tugs, invisible yet undeniable, drawing me onward into shadows where no man has ventured and whence no man may return unscathed.*

I turned the page, feeling the brittle edge scratch lightly against my thumb; a faint itch surfaced at the bridge of my nose, and I scratched it absently, my eyes falling once more upon Winslow’s neat, precise script. The ink looked darker here, almost oily, sinking into the parchment with an unsettling intensity. The next entry lay before me, waiting. I took a steadying breath.

***Journal Entry, 15th February, 1829***

*The apparatus, now augmented with certain modifications, has yielded the most extraordinary results; indeed, what I have observed may strain credulity, yet it must be recorded with the utmost fidelity, for the sake of both science and posterity. Upon this day, I dared to engage The Warden’s Glass upon a human subject—none other than myself—and thus set forth to test whether my theories held substance or were mere phantasmagoria borne of fevered ambition.*

*At first, there was naught but an unsettling disquiet, as if I had peered through a dense mist; shapes appeared, nebulous and indistinct, floating at the periphery of vision. I adjusted the lenses with trembling fingers, aligning them precisely; a curious vertigo ensued, a spinning sensation, brief yet palpable, as though I had plummeted from some great height within my very soul.*

*Then, as the vertigo subsided, I beheld—oh, how shall I describe it?—an apparition, not wholly human, but a shade of myself, clinging to the contours of my face, my hands, my form; it seemed a dark mirror of flesh, pale as death, as though some ghastly double had emerged from within, lurking beneath the skin. There were my eyes, yet hollowed and glistening with a malign intelligence not my own; there were my hands, twisted and elongated, as if stretched by unseen forces to an unnatural shape. This other self regarded me with an expression so dark, so hideously knowing, that a thrill of terror ran through my frame.*

*Yet, the spectacle did not end here; the vision grew stranger, still more grotesque, and I perceived upon my limbs faint trails—pale, winding veins—pulsing not with the warmth of blood but with a thin, sickly light; it traced across my skin as though some inner fire burned weakly within, struggling for release. These veins converged upon my heart, which throbbed visibly beneath the Glass, as if yearning to break free of its bony cage. Indeed, I swear I saw it, my heart itself, beating with a sickly rhythm and tinged with a hue I dare not name; it seemed a creature alive unto itself, malicious, hungry, and ever-watchful.*

*Such was the horror of this vision that I was compelled to tear the Glass from my face, lest I descend fully into madness. My breath came in short, gasping bursts, my hands numb with fright; it was as though I had glimpsed some heretofore hidden world, one that exists beneath our every waking moment, unknown to us, and yet profoundly, horribly real.*

*I write these words with trembling hand, for I know not what next I shall uncover should I continue these trials; yet I am driven by a force I scarcely comprehend, an unquenchable thirst to understand the dark inner workings of our being. There is something—some force or essence—that dwells within each of us, some shadow-self that lurks beyond perception, ever present, and I am determined to unearth it, though it cost me my reason, or my very soul.*

*Tomorrow, I shall endeavor to increase the refractive power of the lenses, to deepen the magnification, and perhaps unveil that which lies even further beneath; for there are layers upon layers yet unexplored, and I feel compelled to venture into these unfathomed depths, however treacherous they may prove.*

*May these notes serve as testament to my efforts, and as a warning to any who may follow; for there is, I suspect, a price to such knowledge, one that has already begun its dark toll upon me.*

I checked my watch—10:42 p.m. Just about time to pack up, call it a night and head home. That was the logical thing to do, of course, but the thought came and went like smoke, barely registering. I was stuck here, rooted to the spot with the journal practically pulling me in. The brittle pages caught the dim light in a way that dared me to leave it unfinished, to abandon Winslow and whatever strange things he’d uncovered. Instead, I turned another page, my pulse picking up.

My eyes landed on his sketches, meticulous and exact. He’d drawn out the *Warden’s Glass*—lenses sketched in sharp detail, measurements scrawled along the sides like the work of a man in a hurry. Below were lists of chemical compounds he’d tried, with a line or two about their “effects on perception,” in a mix of English and Latin that seemed to straddle the line between science and something close to mysticism. 

**Tinctura Salis Nitri**

* **Description**: A tincture derived from purified *sal nitrum* (saltpeter), thrice distilled in a copper alembic; proportioned as 3 drams saltpeter to 1 drachm copper. Purported to “steady the pulse and prepare the nerves for heightened vision.”
* **Dosage**: 12 drops, administered upon the tongue ere the handling of the *Warden’s Glass*.
* **Observation**: “Observed upon trial—a mild clarity of thought, yet tingling persists at the extremities. Requires further refinement.”
* **Latin Notation**: *Per visum maiorem, sed cum tremore* (For greater sight, but with trembling).

**Vapor Mercurii Sublimati in Vinum Plumbum**

* **Description**: A mist derived from calomel (mercury chloride) vapor, suspended in lead-infused wine at a ratio of 2:1 (wine to calomel); believed to “illuminate hidden recesses within the flesh.”
* **Application**: Inhaled sparingly ere observation. Caution advised, as mercury’s influence upon the constitution is known to be deleterious.
* **Observation**: “First trials reveal a subtle brightening in perception, though a dull ache ensues. Mild unease follows.”
* **Latin Notation**: *In corpore visio, tenebrae patent* (In the body, vision opens to shadows).

**Pulvis Lapidis Philosophi, admixtus cum Oleo Absinthii**

* **Description**: A powdered facsimile of the *lapis philosophorum* (Philosopher’s Stone), created through pulverizing native sulfur with oil of absinthe in a ratio of 3 to 1. Purported to sharpen the mental faculties to an extraordinary degree.
* **Dosage**: A small pinch upon the tongue, not to be administered more than twice per fortnight.
* **Observation**: “Immediate effect—awareness heightens, with a ‘second sight,’ though evanescent; faint illusions present to the mind.”
* **Latin Notation**: *Per lumen infernum lumen celatur* (Through infernal light, hidden light is revealed).

**Elixirum Fulmini, Miscere cum Spiritu Terebinthi**

* **Description**: A volatile admixture of spirits of turpentine with tincture of fulminated silver, at a ratio of 3 scruples turpentine to 1 scruple silver. Said to “cleanse the ocular sphere, removing impurities in sight.”
* **Application**: Applied delicately about the eyes using a cloth; vapor inhaled at a distance.
* **Observation**: “Excessive luminance detected in immediate vision, though violent throbbing persisted until following day.”
* **Latin Notation**: *Oculi aperti, cor videt* (Eyes open, heart sees).

**Pulvis Stramonii cum Lacte de Belladonna**

* **Description**: A powder derived from dried thorn apple (*Stramonium*), mixed with an extract of belladonna at a ratio of 2 grains to 1 grain respectively. Purported to allow perception of “phantasmal entities.”
* **Dosage**: A pinch stirred into water or wine, taken with sustenance to avert any ill humors.
* **Observation**: “Pupils dilate; slight euphoria, accompanied by mild hallucinations of forms obscured by shadow.”
* **Latin Notation**: *In somnis, veritas occulta* (In dreams, hidden truth).

**Essentia Aetheris Aquae Regiae**

* **Description**: An essence distilled from *aqua regia* with an admixture of ether, in a proportion of 5 parts *aqua regia* to 1 part ether. Said to unveil that which “lies beneath the flesh.”
* **Dosage**: To be inhaled directly from the bottle, not to exceed three breaths.
* **Observation**: “Dangerous in excess; a potent elixir causing immediate vertigo and narrowness of vision. Fleeting effect, to be used sparingly.”
* **Latin Notation**: *Corpus mutatur, anima apparet* (The body changes, the soul appears).



Winslow’s notes showed a fervor that bordered on obsession; he outlined doses, mixtures, ratios, specifics so precise they were almost unnerving. The parchment held dark stains—residue from his experiments, or maybe just the ink reacting to the years.

Then I hit the next entry, and immediately, the tone shifted. The ink was darker, almost pressed into the paper with a weight that practically dripped frustration—or fear. I took a breath, feeling a chill creep up my arms, and read on.

***Journal Entry, 22nd February, 1829***

*It is with great dismay, mingled with some measure of indignation, that I pen today’s account, for my recent revelations concerning the Warden’s Glass have met with scorn and derision among those I once counted as both colleagues and friends. The very mention of my observations—the vision of that dark being, that infernal double I beheld through the lens—was met with laughter, outright mirth, as if I were a common charlatan recounting tales of phantoms and spirits to gullible children. Even Dr. Abner Hollis, whom I had regarded as a mind of singular curiosity, dismissed my findings as fanciful delusion, urging me to “rest” and “let the fever pass.”*

*There is but one, Mr. Roderick Elwood, whose ear was inclined toward my words with more than passing interest; indeed, he listened as I recounted my ordeal with a silent intensity, his gaze fixed, thoughtful, as though he too had once glimpsed into some dark crevice of the soul. Mr. Elwood, a fellow student of optics and physiology, is a man of sober mind and unyielding curiosity; he has spent many years in the examination of light and refraction, often proposing theories both strange and inspired, yet rooted always in science and logic. At my behest, he agreed to come to my laboratory, to view himself through the Warden’s Glass and see if my account held merit.*

*Upon his arrival, I noted a strange solemnity upon his countenance, as though he approached some sacred rite. I placed the Glass in his hands, noting with satisfaction his careful grip upon the device, his movements precise and respectful, for he understood the nature of invention, of risk. When he at last held the lenses before his eyes, I waited, scarcely daring to breathe, as he peered into his own reflection, his gaze unwavering.*

*Yet, as the moments passed, his expression remained impassive, unmoved; indeed, his features betrayed no trace of horror nor recognition of that shadow-self I had glimpsed so vividly. At length, he removed the Glass and regarded me with a bemused smile, expressing no horror, no dread, but instead a mild disappointment; he claimed to have seen nothing untoward, nothing to suggest the “revelations” I had described with such fervor. He suggested, perhaps too kindly, that my vision had been the product of fatigue or nervous excitation, and recommended I abandon the apparatus for a time, lest it lead me further astray.*

*This revelation—this failure—has left me at once baffled and resentful, for it suggests that the Glass reveals not to all but only to certain eyes, or perhaps certain souls.*

*I am loath to abandon my inquiries, for in them I sense some deeper truth—a truth both terrible and irrevocable. Tomorrow, I shall proceed with another trial, perhaps upon a third party or upon some creature devoid of reason, that I may discern whether this apparition is unique to me alone. Let this entry serve as both testament and warning, for should my findings reveal some singular corruption within my person, I know not what end awaits me, save one of horror.*

I really should’ve been heading home by now; this journal wasn’t paying my overtime. Winslow’s journal had me in a strange grip, as if the lines of ink themselves were threads, winding tighter and tighter around me. I pulled the lamp closer, allowing the warm pool of light to spill across the worn pages, and I turned to the next entry with a growing sense of anticipation.

***Journal Entry, 24th February, 1829***

*To any who might follow my steps through these pages, let this entry serve as a testament to the precarious and beguiling path upon which I now tread. Today, I conducted my latest trial with the Warden’s Glass, and I am yet shaken by the result, unable to decide if the vision I beheld is truth or some horrid delusion crafted by a fevered mind.*

*Having resolved to test the apparatus upon another, I enlisted the company of Mr. Leopold Grant—a figure of some notoriety within the town and not unfamiliar to those versed in local gossip. Accused, albeit never convicted, of unspeakable acts against a woman and child, Grant remains a shadowed presence in our community, a man cloaked in accusations, though no judge’s gavel has ever fallen against him. Despite his standing, I confess a fascination with his intellect, for he speaks with an eloquence that belies the baser rumors surrounding him; his discourse is, in fact, often compelling, with insights that I might describe as mordant, even penetrating, if not for the faint whiff of arrogance which always accompanies his speech.*

*Mr. Grant is a man of many convictions, particularly in matters of social order and the so-called ""rights"" of mankind. He regards the world, as he put it in our discussions today, as “a vast tapestry wherein each thread is not woven by man, but dictated by nature’s own hand.” A peculiar view, yet I found myself reluctantly compelled by his arguments, for he spoke with such fervor on the inherent hierarchy of all living beings, on the natural superiority of the “enlightened few,” that for a moment, I found myself nodding in unthinking assent. It is a view, I must admit, that grows more common in our age—this conviction that certain men are fated for greatness, while others are destined to serve. Such beliefs disturb me; yet, in Mr. Grant’s company, I confess I felt strangely willing to listen.*

*It was with no small sense of foreboding, therefore, that I handed him the Warden’s Glass, knowing his nature but curious to observe if he, too, might glimpse his inner form as I had. I prepared a dose of Tinctura Salis Nitri, administering twelve drops upon his tongue precisely as prescribed. He accepted the tincture without protest, though I noted his lip curled slightly at the bitterness; still, his gaze remained fixed upon the Glass with a peculiar intensity, as though he anticipated some spectacle or revelation unique to himself.*

*At last, he held the lenses to his eyes, his features poised in cold anticipation. I watched him carefully, scarcely daring to breathe as he peered into his reflection, his gaze unwavering, his form statuesque, and his lips set into a thin line of contemplation. The silence stretched between us, thick as a shroud, and I waited for some flicker of recognition to pass over his face.*

*But it was I—not he—who beheld the horror.*

*Through the Glass, I caught sight of his reflection, twisted and blackened, a shadow-self that I dare scarcely describe; for in his visage I beheld not mere flesh, but a mask of malice, as if his inner being had warped his features into a grotesque semblance of humanity. His eyes, dark as pitch, seemed to absorb the light, drawing it inward to feed some monstrous emptiness within; his mouth curled into a smile, but it was a grimace of hollow triumph, a sneer stretched tight as if over bone. The flesh about his throat bore dark lines, winding like chains, as though some inner violence had left its imprint upon his very spirit.*

*I struggled to remain calm, to keep my face impassive, though every nerve in my body urged me to recoil. Mr. Grant lowered the Glass, glancing toward me with a faint expression of curiosity. “Is all well, Mr. Winslow?” he inquired, his voice low and untroubled. For a moment, I stood rooted to the spot, fighting the urge to confess the vision that had chilled me to my marrow.*

*But no words came. Instead, I forced a smile—weak, strained—and assured him all was well, that the Glass was simply an instrument, nothing more. He seemed satisfied with my answer, his mouth twitching into that familiar, unsettling smirk as he handed the Glass back to me, remarking idly that he “had hoped to see something truly remarkable.”*

*And thus, I let him go, saying nothing, betraying nothing, though my mind shrieked with horror at what I had beheld. I should have told him, should have confessed my vision, for he deserves, at the very least, to know the depths of his own corruption; yet, perhaps cowardice or some lingering fascination stayed my tongue. Even now, I cannot shake the image from my mind, nor can I fathom why the Glass should reveal such horrors to my eyes alone.*

I stifled a yawn, rubbing my eyes and reminding myself that any sensible person would’ve left hours ago. But here I was, still anchored to Winslow’s strange, unsettling world. I’d gotten used to this, I suppose—staying long after everyone else had clocked out, losing myself in archives and journals, just as I’d done back in grad school. My old study partners used to make fun of me for it, always the last one hunched over some musty old book while they grabbed drinks. But they’d gotten lazy after a few years; most of them were happily cataloging exhibits or doing desk work now, their curiosity worn down to a dull nub. Maybe I wasn’t exactly Miss Popular, but if that’s what they thought it took to be “likable,” I didn’t care.

I flipped to the next page, feeling the spine shift strangely beneath my fingers—a bit heavier than the rest, a peculiar thickness at the back that I hadn’t noticed until now. I pressed a little, thinking I’d feel something odd beneath the leather cover, but nothing seemed amiss. Just the pages and that sense of old weight, dense and ominous in a way I couldn’t quite explain. Maybe it was just my mind playing tricks on me, tired as I was, but it felt like the journal itself was pressing back, heavier somehow the deeper I got into Winslow’s entries.

Leaning into the lamp’s glow, I turned the page. The flicker of the light seemed to make the ink shift on the page, as though his words were still wet, fresh and almost alive. I took a breath, pushed my glasses up my nose, and read on, drawn in by that same strange, nagging pull.

***Journal Entry, 10th March, 1829***

*A fortnight has passed since the night of Mr. Leopold Grant’s visit, and I find myself gripped by an unease that no science nor rational philosophy can dispel. The Glass, in its cold and indifferent clarity, has revealed a dreadful truth—one I had, until now, successfully cloaked in the comfort of denial. Leopold’s visage, that foul, contorted shade I glimpsed, was no fleeting mirage; it was, I am convinced, a manifestation of his true essence, made visible to me alone.*

*Yet, how did I fail to heed the warnings? The rumors of his alleged misdeeds have lingered about him for years, staining his reputation like a faint shadow one might dismiss in passing, but which clings persistently to the air. There were whispers of a woman, a child—of lives cut short by a silent hand and buried by the cruelty of indifference. He eluded judgment, defended by technicalities and the absence of witnesses, and emerged unscathed in the eyes of the law. And here I was, deceived by his charming eloquence, his wit, even his mind, so coldly rational yet disturbingly vibrant. It sickens me to think that I too might have been charmed into silence, lulled into complacency by my own foolishness.*

*No longer, however, will I rest on such foolish conceits. I have devised a plan to expose the truth, to force this revelation upon the eyes of others who, like myself, have failed to see the wolf among us. I shall host an evening gathering at my own residence, an affair of unusual festivity; and I shall invite a select company—those men and women I deem most respected within our society. This will be a congregation of the learned, the curious, and those of firmest moral standing, for I must secure witnesses of unquestionable judgment; only then can the weight of Leopold’s corruption be laid bare for all to behold.*

*I shall prepare carefully, extending invitations to each guest with utmost discretion, lest the nature of my purpose be misconstrued. I have chosen them with utmost care; there is Dr. Abner Hollis, once a friend, whose skeptical eyes may lend credence to the spectacle I shall unveil, though he regards me now, I believe, with disdain. There is Mrs. Lavinia Crawley, a woman of high social standing, outwardly prim yet keen for the private scandal; perhaps she will delight in the unmasking of our mutual friend. Mr. Edward Salloway shall be among them, a man of inflexible conviction and a strict adherent to logic, whose presence shall serve as a bulwark against any claims of exaggeration or hysteria. And there is Miss Eleanor Finch, an artist of prodigious skill, whose temperament is both studious and unafraid, a woman with a keen eye for shadow.*

*The invitations have been sent, and I have taken pains to craft them in a manner both cordial and mysterious, hinting at a grand spectacle which might arouse their curiosity. Though I am seldom one to host gatherings, I trust that the unusual nature of this event, combined with their intrigue in my scientific pursuits, shall draw them here.*

***17th March, 1829***

*The night of the gathering has come and gone, and I am yet in a state of agitation, a turmoil so profound I scarcely know how to order my thoughts upon this page.*

*They arrived in finery, exchanging pleasantries in the candlelit corridors of my home; I greeted each with cordiality, concealing the quiet dread that gnawed at the edge of my mind. Leopold was among the last to arrive, sauntering in with that insufferable air of familiarity, as though he and I were kin of the closest order. He clasped my hand, a broad, arrogant smile spread across his face, and I felt a shudder seize me, an impulse to pull away, to banish him from my sight; yet I smiled, swallowing the disgust that welled within me.*

*Wine flowed freely, and soon laughter and the low hum of conversation filled the rooms; yet beneath it all, a tension simmered, invisible to all but myself. I waited until the hour was late and their spirits sufficiently loosened before making my suggestion—that we adjourn to the lower chambers where my laboratory lay, for I had “a marvel” to show them.*

*They laughed, teased me as expected, yet curiosity won out, and they followed, descending into the dimly lit room where my apparatus awaited. The laboratory was arranged with deliberate care: the Warden’s Glass rested upon a velvet-draped pedestal, surrounded by vials and tinctures whose oils glimmered faintly in the gaslight, casting shadows that flickered against the walls. I had prepared the room as one might a stage, each object meticulously placed, each light angled to create an atmosphere both scientific and foreboding.*

*One by one, I offered them the Salis Nitri, observing with satisfaction as each obligingly took a measured dose; I administered the preparations carefully, precisely as before, knowing that any deviation might compromise the outcome. As each guest took their turn peering into the Glass, I noted with relief that their reflections remained untainted, their forms unchanged; they laughed, finding nothing to remark upon save for a faint dizziness from the tincture’s effects.*

*Finally, it was Leopold’s turn. Yet no sooner had I extended the vial than he declined, laughing as he waved it away. “I have tasted your draught once, Winslow,” he jested, “and I see little need to subject myself again.” His voice, dripping with casual insolence, made my blood pound hotly, yet I forced myself to maintain composure, coaxing him with gentle persistence. He continued to resist, and the others began to laugh at my insistence, though I sensed a flicker of hesitation in his eyes—a trace of something that only deepened my resolve.*

*Before I could press further, a clumsy guest—young Mr. Pettinger, the son of a local magistrate and entirely inebriated—stumbled forward, declaring his eagerness to try the experiment once more. His heavy hand caught the edge of the pedestal; the Glass, my creation, my only means of revealing the truth, toppled to the floor with a sickening crash. In an instant, it shattered, shards of glass scattering across the stone, reflecting a dozen fractured images of my horrified face.*

*Rage surged within me, a torrent so fierce I feared it might consume me utterly. I scarcely remember how I ushered them out, my voice tight, my gestures sharp and unkind. Leopold gave me one last smirk as he left, a look that seared itself into my mind, mocking me, taunting me with the knowledge he had escaped yet again. As the door closed behind the last of them, I stood alone in the darkened room, staring at the remnants of my work, a hollow emptiness settling within me.*

*Yet beneath the emptiness, a darker impulse stirs, a heat that I cannot ignore. I find my mind drifting to thoughts of vengeance, to the image of my hands wrapped around a throat, squeezing, feeling the life drain slowly away. I see it as clearly as I see the room before me: Leopold’s face, contorted in shock, in pain, in horror as I exact upon him the justice he has evaded for too long.*

I closed the journal with a slow, steadying breath, feeling that prickling chill on the back of my neck, the kind that keeps its hold long after the lights go on. Winslow’s words were a trap I was willingly stepping into, deeper and deeper with every page. My shift had ended ages ago—but the idea of going home felt so…trivial. The museum was empty, quiet, and as always during these hours - rare as they are besides occasions such as this one - I liked it that way. The silence wrapped around me like a wool coat, somehow making Winslow’s twisted little world feel all the more real.

I got up, stretched, and wandered down the dim corridors, looking at the exhibits I’d walked past hundreds of times without a second thought. There were glass cases of polished brass instruments, faded maps, and fragments of machines that once hummed and clanked in some distant past, their usefulness as dead as their makers. Some pieces reminded me of that strange mix of people you meet in school—the ones who can’t leave the past alone, whose lives revolve around dusty artifacts, more comfortable with objects than with people. I’d been one of those, too. Still was, I guess.

I thought about the things Winslow had written, the strange way he seemed so formal, so poised, even while talking about horrific things. And yet, the cold detachment didn’t make it any less unsettling; if anything, it made him sound even more unhinged. Like he saw the world through a lens the rest of us weren’t privy to, and that lens wasn’t showing him anything pleasant.

Funny, though. The more I read, the more I could almost understand him. Winslow was someone you’d see wandering the library stacks at university, the one who barely looked at you, who muttered to himself like no one else was there. I’d known people like that. Hell, I’d *been* people like that. Lost in their work, their little pockets of esoteric knowledge, and wrapped so tightly in themselves they couldn’t connect with anyone else. Not that I’d had a huge circle of friends to begin with. They’d called me abrasive, prickly, or “too blunt.” Like that was somehow my problem.

But I’d never cared for the small talk, the endless cups of coffee over gossip about professors or breakups. Too many of them were just waiting for life to get started, like there was some grand event right around the corner. I’d found comfort in the straightforward nature of things like this museum. Artifacts don’t disappoint; they just…are. Just like Winslow’s journal, fixed and constant in its quiet horror.

I wandered past an old brass astrolabe, its darkened surface polished smooth by god knows how many hands, and caught a glimpse of myself reflected in the glass—a little older, maybe, and definitely tired, but the same me that stared back at people a little too directly. 

My mind wandered back to Winslow’s “*Nitre Tincture*” and the mad certainty in his words as he described his plan. The image of his guests in the cold light of his laboratory, not knowing they were about to witness something…something awful. I could almost picture him, adjusting the Glass with one hand, trying to hide his disgust for Leopold with the other. The man had ambition, I’d give him that. And even though he was bordering on deranged, there was something satisfying in seeing him out to prove everyone wrong. That sense of triumph over the ones who doubt you, who turn up their noses at what you know.

After a while, I made my way back to the journal, a little clearer, ready to get lost in it again.

***Journal Entry, 29th March, 1829***

*The deed is done; there is no turning back now, and I write this account with hands steadied by grim purpose. Leopold Grant is dead—by my own hand, and by methods as precise and deliberate as any experiment. I have, at last, silenced the monster within him, though I am aware that in doing so, I may have awakened the same within myself.*

*I encountered him alone, in the shrouded hours between night and dawn, when the streets are silent and only shadows bear witness. I had observed his habits with meticulous care; he often took solitary walks at that hour, basking, no doubt, in the certainty of his impunity. I had prepared my tools—the tinctures and powders that would ensure a swift yet undeniable end, items familiar to my hand but now turned to a darker purpose.*

*Approaching him, I offered my cordial greeting, concealing within it the cold malice that had festered in my heart. He returned my address with that same smugness, that insufferable smile; and yet, even as he spoke, his words rang hollow to my ears. I felt as though the world had narrowed to the beat of his pulse, to the delicate arch of his throat, to the faint gleam of his breath hanging in the air. There, under that shadowed lamplight, I pressed the vial to his lips, insisting it was a draft to ease “the malaise of the spirit.” Ever arrogant, he accepted it without question, swallowing my poison as if it were merely another trifling amusement.*

*The effects were swift, as I knew they would be; his eyes widened, his hand clutched his chest, and he fell to his knees, gasping for air that would no longer serve him. I watched, transfixed, as he convulsed, the once-powerful limbs now twitching feebly, his voice reduced to a mere whimper. The darkness consumed him, and I observed each stage of his passing with a dispassion that frightened me more deeply than the act itself; it was as if I had stepped beyond mere morality, into a realm where justice was the only law.*

*I write these words not from guilt, for I feel none, but from a strange, lingering satisfaction. I have succeeded where the law and society failed. Let this entry stand as testament; he has paid for his sins in kind, and I, though damned, feel a purity in my actions, as though I have struck a balance between the shadows of this world and the light.*

I dropped the journal, my hands suddenly cold, trembling as if I’d touched something forbidden, unholy. Winslow’s words echoed in my mind—a confession. Cold-blooded, calculated murder. This journal wasn’t just a record of experiments; it was his dark, twisted diary, and I’d just read his final, damning entry.

As the book hit the table, something slipped out from between the pages, landing with a soft thud. A flat object, wrapped in parchment. So that’s what had been causing that strange weight shift. I hesitated, heart pounding, before reaching for it. I slid it out from the parchment, cautiously peeling back the layers as it began to glint under the light—a piece of glass, clear but with an almost unnatural shimmer.

Then it struck me. This wasn’t just any piece of glass. It was *the* Glass, a shard of Winslow’s infamous *Warden’s Glass*. Somehow, he’d saved a fragment, hidden it here. But why? He’d never intended for the journal to be found, or did he? Was this some deranged message left for anyone who might stumble upon it? A tool for... what exactly?

As I held it up, the glint caught my eye, refracting the light, casting odd reflections across the walls. I squinted, adjusting it, when something shifted in the glass. I blinked, my mind insisting I was seeing things, but there it was—a faint, twisted image staring back at me. My own face, but… wrong. My features were there, yes, but warped, malevolent, a grotesque reflection filled with a cold, wicked intelligence that wasn’t mine.

I gasped, dropping the glass instinctively; it sliced across my finger as it fell, and a sharp sting brought me back to reality. I watched in silence as a single drop of blood slid down my fingertip, hitting the table with a soft splatter. My breath hitched, relieved it hadn’t splashed onto the journal, as though preserving Winslow’s final words mattered more than the thin line of red beginning to stain my skin.

For a long moment, I just stood there, staring down at the shard on the floor. That face I’d seen—had it been my imagination? Or had Winslow left this glass behind intentionally, some silent invitation to see what he’d seen?",4,1731012176.0,nosleep,1,0.83,False

1gm0hbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1gm0hbk/my_past_best_friend_had_a_thing_with_our_high/,"My past best friend had a ""thing"" with our high school teacher","Yeah, my highschool best friend, Em, went on dates with our English teacher.

  
Em, who was 18 at the start of their conversations, had come to me one day and jokingly asked that she was ""flirting"" with Mr. Es, maybe aged mid-40s?. Em was sometimes like that, call basic interactions as flirtatious, but of course, they never actually *were.*

  
Mr. Es was her AP English teacher. There were times, quite often tbh, that she'd arrive late to his class, and she'd try to make it up by buying him Starbucks. He'd be leniant on her, you know, giving her passes on certain quizzes that maybe he wouldn't for other students. I cannot really say much on this as I never took his class so I'm not entirely sure if he'd do the same for others.

  
Mr. Es' background was that he was a family man, but according to Em, he wouldn't talk much about his wife. He'd share anecdotes about his son, but ""never mention his wife"". She went as far as to say he didn't wear his wedding ring so he must be ""available"". It all felt icky to me. To make it worse, she went online and stalked the hell out of him. Found his address, information on his wife, and family members. 

  
Well, fast forward to a few hangouts, and the only time we got to actually sit down and chat was filled with this idea and her what-ifs with him. She couldn't stop fantasising about Mr. Es. It didn't help that the tiktoks she'd send him were about people's (romantic) preferences being older men. Well, he'd heart those. Kinda weird...

  
Anyway, she'd jokingly ask him to go running together, and he agreed to take her, as in, pick her up from her house and then drive to a park to run together. She also offered him a coffee after and said, ""might take you up on that offer.""

  
Once they actually started going on dates, they'd go out of town so no one recognises them, she couldn't post on her socials about their times together... because he was her teacher. She'd ask around for advice about how to handle it, but she'd lie to pretty much everyone because she knew it was wrong, 'least morally.

  
When it fizzled, man, she went off the rails. Always crying, excessive drinking, sneaking into bars and clubs. I couldn't be there for her as it became a lot for me to handle very early on. Luckily, she had someone else to lean on, but that didn't go well either. She'd panic at not having a response within 2-3 hours despite him coaching, teaching, and having a son to take care of. Not to mention, his WIFE! He was a family man above everything and even told her that he would never divorce his wife. Dunno what that was about tbh.

  
I couldn't cope with her anymore. It drained me to hear about the same thing and in detail. I didn't want to hear about them making out, or their dates, or read their messages. I had my own problems to handle, but she never cared about how I was doing.

  
Anyway, been holding onto this for a few years now. Thanks

1gm0ghn,https://www.reddit.com/r/h3snark/comments/1gm0ghn/why_i_finally_left/,Why I finally left,"I'm honestly sad. Maybe that sounds dramatic but I unsubbed after being a dedicated viewer and supporter for 5+ years. I bought teddy fresh, told other people to buy it. Talked about the podcast to my friends. Watched almost every episode. I never thought I would be here.

I really liked Ethan. I related to Ethan's journey with mental health and weight loss, I loved his no holding back commentary and his sense of humor. I respected how he built this show from the ground up, going from not being able to buy green peppers to risking it all in a lawsuit to defend other YouTube creators with fair use. 

What happened?

First off, Ethan has never been good at taking the L. He's always been really slow to see other people's points of view and know when he is wrong. But it was never impossible like it is now.

Somehow he has descended into this place where the crew actually seems scared to be honest with him at all. The button incident made this all the more obvious. They can no longer push back for fear of it reflecting poorly on them as an employee, rather than as what it should be, which is open and free, fun, debate and discussion between personalities which all come together to make the show great.

The crew seems like they don't even want to talk anymore. It feels like everything they say is through a filter of ""will this set him off.""

When they are reduced to being just employees and Ethan is just the boss, it no longer has the vibes of being a fun safe open discussion between peers. The employees are just acting to try and please someone. Maybe that is what Ethan thought he wanted. Everyone agreeing with him, surrounded by yes men. But who does that benefit? What does that turn the show into when the whole premise is to be unfiltered fun? It's not unfiltered anymore when no one can speak their mind. It's not fun when you're scared of getting chewed out or fired. And yeah of course they are still his employees. But that didn’t used to be all they were.  

And that brings me to AB and Lena. They always say that we are being parasocial and weird when we worry about them and that they are fine. Maybe that's true. Or maybe they just don't see it yet.

It was a running joke on the show that Ethan was mean to AB. Where's the joke? It's not a gag when it's actually happening in real life behind the scenes. AB put a ton of work into that powerpoint and Ethan acted bored and salty the whole time. But Ethan's commentary and the researcher coming together is what makes it entertaining. Ethan put all the weight of the entertainment value on the research part when HE was the one NOT DOING HIS PART. He was supposed to provide the jokes and the commentary that combined with the drama and news make it entertaining. But he just sat there bored, clearly in a mood, and then blamed others that it wasn't fun. This has happened multiple times. Blaming others when he was the one causing the problem.

I don't like the way they treat Lena. She is funny! I feel like she should have been promoted by now. She's a full on personality who is part of so many memes and has had lead roles on so many segments but she's still getting Ethan's coffee? It's also just embarrassing imo. Why can't he just get his own coffee before the show? Isn't Lena a friend? Or at the very least a little more important than how she is treated?

And lastly...

Listen, I really don't care about politics. I’m sorry but I've never liked Hasan. He's always come off as super pretentious to me. I didn't watch leftovers. And frankly, I get where Ethan is coming from to some extent. His wife is from Israel, she has family still there, he lived there, worked there, has friends there, met his wife and got married there. It's probably a personally special place to him.

But you know where else is probably personality significant to him? America. And has he ever held back criticizing the wars this country has been in? Ummm. No! He made an entire podcast criticizing the policies of a country he loves. He was never a blind nationalist. He even admits he doesn't agree with the principles behind what Israel is doing yet he turns around and defends every action they take along the way. Why? Actually why? It is so out of character from who I thought he was.

Special mention - The poker stream. I love poker, I watched the whole thing. But the irony of how he promoted poker and showed gambling apps while in the past criticized others who did the same thing. Kinda funny. 

And so that's where we are. 

Jordan Peterson told him that trying to do the right thing all the time would lead him down a path where his audience had higher and higher standards that he would eventually not be able to meet and that it would led to his downfall.

Is that what this is? How can it be when I haven't changed? I was ready to fight on Ethan's side through this Hasan thing. But he doesn't want fans who are critical thinkers. If he did, he'd at the very least listen to what they are saying before he shuts them down.  
  
It's not all politics or a morally superior fan base. That's part of it but it's not the root of it imo.

The fans are always to blame in Ethan's eyes. But I thought that they were making the show for us? Right? Isn't that the point? 

But Ethan told us to leave, to stop watching if we don't agree. And he is getting exactly what he asked for.  

  
It's just sad. He doesn't care about the fans who supported him year after year through countless controversies. I unsubbed last week. I am still hoping that he might someday realize what he is doing and get out of this. But I donno man. I donno.",129,1731011861.0,h3snark,11,0.94,False

I was having a long sit on a bench; you were walking your dog and had passed me a couple times.

You hesitated but moved on, and as I watched you walk down the hill with your dog I started bawling. Truthfully, life is hanging heavy on me right now (like so many folks), and today is one of those days where it's hard to keep going. Your kindness was very touching; I wish I could have told you how much it meant that you stopped to ask. I feel like I didn't do a good job convincing you that I'm alright, so here I am whispering into the void that I'm safe, I'm stable, and I'm very fortunate to have an abundance of support around me; all is going to be ok, even if I don't quite feel like it at the moment.

Only child of a possible NMom and an EDad who died by suicide when I was 15. After my dad’s death, my mom’s abuse became even more extreme. Since my Dad died by suicide and I am an only child, my mom fell into a victim mindset. I believe this is covert narcissism. She has manipulated me since I was a kid through guilt and shame. To this day, I deal with a lot of internalized guilt and shame. 

After I graduated college and saved up for a year, at 24 I moved out of my mom’s apartment and into a new apartment with my partner about an hour away from her. We are still happily together and he has seen me through this complicated relationship with my mom. Moving out of my mom’s place has shown me how fucked up my childhood and adolescence was. I am still coming to terms with it. 



2024:

In January, my partner and I got a puppy who has been a fantastic addition to our lives. I have been spending most of my time at home over the past several months training him. My mom has come over twice and I have gone to her apartment once a month in this past year. She has not been understanding about my limitations/time restraints and even treats our puppy with disdain and neglect. 

The visits on the weekends are always 5+ hours long and are always unpleasant. She happily watches soccer on the TV, show me tabloid articles, call her friends in front of me, and complains to me. Literally zero questions about my life, my partner, his job, my studies, or our puppy. 

Last summer, my partner had to have surgery. Though he has been recovering very well, he isn’t able to independently walk our dog. Also, my partner can’t risk our dog biting him at his surgical site (which has already happened a few times) and therefore, I am the person who primarily cares for the dog, especially when my partner is at work. 

A week before the surgery, I told my mom that I would not be able to see her as much, as care for my partner is a priority. She told me that she understood but it predictably went in one ear and out the other. 

Meanwhile, my mom’s apartment is becoming more and more dilapidated. Her landlord has dementia and the landlord’s family is planning on selling the home soon. I have been getting calls from my mom in the past few months about how there are holes in the living room wall, a hole in the ceiling, there’s asbestos in the basement that she has been exposed to. The holes, I think, are from botched construction jobs that the family hasn’t completed. I honestly don’t know, whenever I ask directly, I never get a complete answer from my mom. 

Since my mom told me this, I have been ramping up my efforts to get her out of her apartment and find her a decent place to live. She has money, though she refuses to tell me how much. I show her potential areas and houses that are practical, but she never follows up. She is not, by her own admission, doing any research to get herself out of her apartment. She spends her mental energy calling me and complaining about the state of the apartment and how her landlord is stealing various pieces of mail from her.

The conversations since the surgery have gotten more and more tense, filled with my efforts to help her get out of this apartment and her complaining that I was not visiting her enough. I have heard the whole narcissistic narrative that she has constructed. She doesn’t listen to my “excuses” anymore about my partner’s recovery. She doesn’t want to meet at a cafe or a restaurant. She doesn’t want to come over. She is adamant that I go and see her. 



Oct. 20th:

On Oct. 20th, I received a call from my mom. She was, predictably, upset with me because I haven’t seen her in a while. It was another weekend that was spent by herself. She complained that I was spending time with my partners parents too much (She doesn’t know anything about my relationship with my partners parents, it was purely speculation) and she feels left out. 

She asked why I think it’s okay to not help her in her situation with her house. I calmly explained to her that I do not think it’s safe for me to go over to her house and expose myself to asbestos. She said that she wished she never told me that, I’m using it as an excuse, and that she isn’t even sure it’s asbestos- since it’s not confirmed, come!

Predictably, she forgot the biggest reason why I am not coming over which is my partner’s recovery from surgery. She was too busy focusing on her own feelings to rationally remember the reason why I can’t come to see her. 

I reminded her that we would be more than happy if she came here to us. 



Oct. 23rd:

I invite her for coffee by her workplace while my dog was being groomed. She accepts. It was a normal conversation, though she reminded me of the various things in my own personal life that she is disappointed with (mostly that I don’t have a job at the moment. She doesn’t care that I am studying to go to grad school) She then packed on pressure to visit my extended family for Thanksgiving and Christmas this year. I never see them and I don’t intend to this year. We already spoke about this. I extended an invitation to my mom that she can be at my apartment for both of those holidays, we would love to have her.

I invited her to come to our apartment on the following Sunday, we would be having a Halloween celebration with our dog. She said that she would love to come, but when I double checked with her, she said that she would rather stay home.



Oct. 29th:

Since my mom did not come on Sunday, my partner and I continued on with our day as planned. I sent my mom a few pictures of my dog in his Halloween costume and thought nothing of it. She responds that he was very cute, nothing seemed out of the ordinary.

On October 29th, my mom texted me while at work, complaining that she was “very sad”. I got a bit concerned, so I called her. She answered and said that she was angry with me…because, you guessed it, she didn’t see me last Sunday. I pointed out that she was the one who cancelled, not me. I would have loved to see her. But she side-stepped that and proceeded to yell at me even more pointed accusations and insults. She asked, “What are you doing to help me get out of this apartment?” And that was when I started to get angry. I raised my voice and listed off everything that I have been doing and how absolutely downright unfair it is for her to ask this of me. 

I finally broke down in tears while telling her how hard this is for me. I wish for one normal conversation where I don’t have to defend myself and my choices, but instead all that I am getting is a mom who is constantly upset with me and won’t listen or help. While crying, I said, “Why are you doing this to me? Why can’t you just be a mom for a moment? I don’t deserve this.” 

She talked over me throughout me crying and started to demand to see me this Sunday. She just kept repeating until she was yelling again, “I need to see you, I NEED TO SEE YOU, I AM COMING TO  SEE YOU THIS SUNDAY, I AM COMING TO SEE YOU THIS SUNDAY, I AM COMING TO SEE YOU THIS SUNDAY.”

I was crying, and at this point panicking because of how hysterical she was getting, so I told her to stop yelling. She just kept repeating the above phrase. I got so panicked that I hung up the phone. I cried on and off for the entire evening. 



Oct. 30th until today:

I drafted a message to her, but my partner advised me to not send it, which was wise. I needed to sleep first and get my mind in order. 

Now, she keeps calling me- from Oct. 31st-Nov 2nd, she has been calling me (with a few text messages) almost nonstop. She left me a voicemail on Saturday sounding genuinely worried if I was safe. I texted her a very brief message saying that I was safe, just taking space away from her. I am not ready to speak to her. She asked again to see me the following day, but I said no. I needed time. She called me again today, but I did not answer.



It feels like I am reliving all of the abuse from my childhood at once. I am feeling so unsafe in my apartment, the only safe home that I have ever been in. Anytime she calls me, my anxiety heightens to a tremendous level where my heart starts beating fast and I start shaking. I can’t think straight and it takes me about 10-15 minutes to come back into my body. I feel genuinely afraid. 

Even in these brief respites where she is not calling me, I can never relax. I don’t want to block her just in case something is seriously wrong. My birthday is this Sunday and hers is the following Sunday, I feel like we are going to have to speak soon and I don’t know what to say. 

Thank you for reading. What should I do? I feel so lost and completely helpless.

I've never really analyzed a blood test before so I wanted to discuss a bit and maybe figure out why I have the results I do. Thank you in advance for any comments/assistance :)

I'm surprised to see this as I don't eat much red meat, have a drink maybe twice a year (I am currently sober and plan to stay that way), have never used tobacco or any drug of any kind. I was vegetarian for about 10 years before beginning to have meat again in 2023.

*Family history:* Both parents have diabetes as well as high blood pressure. Grandparents as well on the maternal side.

**My typical diet and exercise routine is such:**

*Diet:* I eat 1200 calories a day, sometimes less. I try to do 16 to 20 hour fasts everyday. I eat usually banana and a protein yogurt for breakfast, nothing for lunch, and a big salad with chicken/salmon, a bit feta cheese, assorted veggies and no dressing. Another breakfast I have often is black coffee with sourdough bread and hummus/peanut butter and some strawberries. 

I drink about 6 cups of water a day, maybe more because I'm a big water drinker. I do not consume fast food ever and stay away from fried things. 

When I go out to eat with friends (about once or twice a week max) I usually do an extended fast/OMAD and try to eat healthy, usually a vegetarian or chicken/salmon dish. I try to split dessert or just not order it. 

*Exercise:* I go on my stationary bike about 4 times per week for a period of 20 to 30 minutes, and then do some Youtube aerobic exercises about 3 times a week for about 15 to 20 minutes. I usually get around 7k steps a day just with my daily commute. 

*Etc:* I am 115lbs, 5 feet tall and my waist is 28 inches. 

*Additional info:* I do actively struggle with an eating disorder. I am not currently in any recovery program, please be kind. I currently do not take any vitamins or supplements, but I ordered a fish oil supplement and a multivitamin to try and lower my levels. I get about 7 hours of sleep per night and my job is not very stressful.

1gm0bw3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gm0bw3,Ajmal Kuro : Most Honest Review on the internet ,"Short review (for lazy people like myself):

Ajmal Kuro is like a 'Curry made in Hurry'. Don't buy it. It's not a good fragnance for the price. ₹2000 for 90ml of kuro is not justified when you have so many other better options. It's the red flag of perfumes, it smells bad, it smells pungent, it smells like boric acid. Avoid it, if possible.

Detailed review (For upvotes) :

So I wrote a review of Ajmal Kuro along with nine other perfumes a few days ago, which you can check out here(if this link doesn't works, you can check my profile too).
 https://www.reddit.com/r/DesiFragranceAddicts/s/9v1FSahMXT

That review was based on my initial impression on the fragnances and some people in the comments suggested to macerate the perfume and wear only one perfume in a day, to properly judge it. So that's what I did and here's a more detailed review of Ajmal Kuro.

Since my last review, Kuro has grown(macerated/matured) as a fragnance in my almirah and I have also grown as a person (Olfactory skills). So my opinions about Kuro have also evolved a bit.

On Amazon Kuro is priced at around 2400₹ for 90ml and  in grey market you can get it under 2000₹ maybe for 90ml.

With the first whiff I can understand kuro is a combination of some intense spices and wood and some other smell in the background which I am not able to identify along with oud, it's a new smell for my nose(the complex opening).

The opening is extremely spicy. It opens with some combination of cardamom and black pepper. I made few people around me smell it and asked them which spice can you smell and none of them was able to identify black pepper. But, I can identify it. Infact the opening is black pepper dominant. The complete complex opening becomes like boric acid due to the combination but if you try to identify them seperately, I would say black pepper is dominant.

I saw some other reviews of kuro and they mentioned the opening contains saffron as well but I can't smell any saffron in the opening. Also, it doesn't contain any 'richness' as mentioned by few. If I compare it with Lataffa Asad which is also known for the spices that it contains, Asad smells much more premium and rich compared to kuro. Kuro smells like a cheap perfume to me. If I do a blind test, according to me most people would say Asad is expensive than Kuro.

Some reviews also say there's a floral heart note and they mention flowers like rose and lavender, which seems like a joke to me. I can't smell them at all. I really like lavender but I think it's anyways incompatible with the other notes of kuro, so it's good if they have unnoticable presence.

In the dry down, there's something citrus in the middle and base notes, not leamon, something like bergamot which is not going well at all with the top note.


Kuro is an extremely heavy scent. Suitable with formal wear for an old fashioned or atleast for an older and mature guy. It's extremely masculine scent. I don't recommend it but if you are stubborn I would say only extremly masculine/mature men and women who ride Bullet motorcycle should wear it.

To me it's an example of a poor craftsmanship. Like a chief who will make 'curry in a hurry'. The chief will put random quantity of ingredients to meet the deadline, it seems like that's how Kuro was created.

It's not a mass pleaser at all. It's really shocking to me because some people say it's a copy of Dior Sauvage which is a mass pleaser as per the reviews(I have never smelled Sauvage) .

In my humble opinion, kuro might be an accuired taste for some people just like black coffee. You have to brainwash yourself until you start liking it.

It's so harsh, strong and masala intense that when I smell it closely from my wrist, it creates a burning sensation in my nose like the hair inside my nose are burning. If you spray more, it might even be suffocating for you and people around you.

It doesn't has any 'freshness' elements atleast in the opening. Which is another negative aspect about it.

It contains some Oud as well. I have an attar which is called Purple oud (combination of lavender and oud), I bought that attar from a local shop and the oud in it smells so calming and pleasant but the oud in kuro is too pungent or animalic and off putting. I don't know if it's due to the quality of oud they have used(I don't think they have used bad quality oud because my attar costs like 300₹ for 6ml and kuro is for 2000₹+ ) or is it because of the overall combination they have used.

 
They have used the Right bottle for perfume, dark. Because I can imagine a old and mature masculine man in black suit who choose not to marry ever wearing something like this). They can use my photo as well that's actually a better representation of how it smells. Like some black pepper heavy masala box. I am sure It's a turn off for women as well.

In the later Drydown stage, some new pungent smell starts to come maybe due to ambroxan (a synthetic ambergris molecule) or i don't know what smell it is, it's new smell for me which I am not liking at all.

The only good thing about it is Longevity is amazing, projection is also amazing. I did one spray on each wrist and I was able to smell it after 8hr+ if I take my nose closer to my wrist.

I don't know why few people are saying it's versatile perfume according to me it's for , Colder season and it's a night perfume because it's so warm.

I asked three people how I smelled while I was wearing it, one of them said I smell like vomit. Another person said you are smelling really bad and it's better to not wear any perfume than wearing this and finally my sister who has really good olfactory skills she can identify many notes which I can't, she said I smell disgusting what are you wearing.

Final rating: Earlier I gave it -10/10 now I don't think it's as bad, the boric acid aspect of it has reduced a bit. I would give it -8/10 now.

Final Conclusion: Not recommended.

Note: I am new to fragrances, and I have only smelled some 50 fragnances till now so take my reviews with a pinch of salt and my nose is not a trained nose as well. You can ask to experts of this sub before coming to the decision of buying/not buying Kuro.",4,1731011531.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,18,0.63,False

1gm05qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/HypotheticalPhysics/comments/1gm05qo/here_is_a_hypothesis_does_moving_through_time/,Here is a hypothesis: Does Moving Through Time Create Energy?,"When we think about time, it usually feels like something that just flows around us — a constant river we all travel along. But what if time isn’t just a passive dimension? What if, by moving through it, all the matter in the universe is actually generating a tiny bit of energy? Imagine time as a sort of cosmic “road,” and all matter as cars moving forward on that road. If there’s friction on a real road, it produces heat — so could the movement of matter through time also create subtle energy effects?

1. Time’s One-Way Street: The Arrow of Time

In the world around us, we experience time in one direction only: forward. You pour milk into coffee, and it mixes, but it doesn’t unmix. This forward direction is often called the “arrow of time.” Scientists say it’s tied to entropy, or the tendency for things to go from order to disorder. Just as a clock only ticks forward, so does the universe — and everything in it, from atoms to stars, follows this forward flow of time.

2. Time and Friction: Could Moving Through Time Create Energy?

Now, here’s where things get interesting. In our everyday world, moving through a medium creates energy through friction. Imagine a meteor entering Earth’s atmosphere — it heats up and burns because of friction with the air. Or think about the heat created when you rub your hands together. What if moving through time creates a similar effect, just much smaller?

Could the act of matter moving forward in time create a faint, almost undetectable form of energy? This idea might seem out there, but it’s not so different from other ideas in physics that connect movement with energy.

3. Examples of How Matter and Time Already Interact

Time isn’t entirely separate from matter; in fact, they interact in fascinating ways:

Gravity and Time: Gravity doesn’t just pull things down; it actually affects time itself. Around massive objects like black holes, time moves slower. This means that matter and time are already interacting in ways we can observe. It’s a bit like a heavy rock causing a dip in a trampoline; the weight bends the surface and affects everything around it.

Quantum Fluctuations in “Empty” Space: At tiny scales, even “empty” space isn’t truly empty; it’s filled with fluctuations and energy blips. Scientists call this zero-point energy, and it’s a reminder that the universe is full of interactions happening at a level we don’t normally see. If time itself has any active role, it might interact with matter in ways that create faint energy at a similarly small scale.


4. The Hypothesis: Time as an Active Force

This brings us to the big idea: if time isn’t just a passive backdrop but something matter actively “moves” through, it could have a small but real impact. Imagine every atom, every particle, every galaxy experiencing a slight “drag” as it moves through time. This drag could create an almost invisible energy field. We might think of it as a background hum, produced simply by the forward journey of everything in the universe through time.

5. What Could This Mean for Our Understanding of the Universe?

Although this is a new way to think about time, it touches on some of the big questions science is trying to answer. We don’t know what exactly drives the universe’s expansion, nor do we fully understand the subtle “background” energies like dark energy that seem to affect space itself. Could some faint, time-related energy play a part?

Conclusion:

While this idea is just a thought experiment, it invites us to rethink time as more than a clock ticking forward. What if time itself, in some hidden way, contributes to the energy in the universe? By seeing time as an active force rather than a passive one, we may open the door to new ways of understanding the fundamental nature of the universe — and our place within it.



This is my theory, but due to me being dyslexic, I did get help with AI to help me write this. This is not the AIs idea, nor did it give me this idea. I just want to discuss it with someone who has an open mind and doesn't automatically dismiss my idea just because.

 If you can say this can be disproven, please do so, but don't just tell me I'm wrong with no facts to back it up. That isn't helpful, it isn't scientific, and it goes against the principles of science and scientific discovery. I'm just a business man, looking for a discussion that isn't one sided.

1gm01xb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gm01xb/faceless_mary/,Faceless Mary,"Hey nosleep. I’m Trish, I’ve lurked on this subreddit for a while now, reading everyone’s experiences and what not. I always was skeptical of them, until about a month ago. I’m in high school, junior year to be exact, and at homecoming something happened.

My best friend, Mary, was always a bit of a recluse. Even when we were five she would fake being sick just to stay at my house for the day. Even after our parents stopped talking to each other my dad would always let her stay the night despite his own issues with her parents. I never knew what happened between them, I don’t think I ever will after what happened.

Mary liked to prank people, a lot. She got in trouble with so many of our teachers because of her pranks. I remember this one day in our freshman year, she was pitching a scheme to me. She wanted to glitter bomb our homeroom teacher, ended up suspended for a day because of it.

I think that fueled her pranks, honestly I wish it never did. I wish she just stopped. I wish she didn’t get worse. She kept pranking our teachers, kept getting suspended and getting detentions. It got worse. I didn’t think anything of it when it happened, I was like a frog in a slowly boiling pot. I didn’t realize how bad it was until it was too late. How could I?

She stuck to her glitter bombs for a long time, it was harmless minus the mess. No one would think anything of it. I certainly didn’t. When she started taking interest in those more advanced glitter bombs I didn’t care. It was just glitter. In our sophomore year she started taking a mechanics class.

She was so excited about it. She’d rush to my house after school each day and have me make things with her. I didn’t fully get all of it, but Mary was so happy. Even when she started bringing car parts over I didn’t think anything of it.

One time she came over and slammed this car engine onto the coffee table, I nearly fell out of the couch at the slamming noise.

“Be careful, that’s an old table!” My dad called from the kitchen. He always avoided her when she came over.

“Sorry, Mr. Davidson!” Mary called back, before whipping her head over to me. She blew some of her black hair out of her face, smiling wide. “Guess how much I got this for!”

I sighed, moving to stand up. “There’s a dump right by your house, I know you got it from there.”

“Actually that closed, dangerous conditions or something I don’t know. Nah, Mrs. Forrest gave it to me!” Mary said. “Completely free of charge. She phrased it as a school project, but apparently it’s not exactly for a grade.”

“Not exactly?”

“She phrased it weirdly.” Mary shrugs.

“Ah. So what do you need to do to it?” I asked.

Mary beamed. “Clean it out, get rid of some dents and the rust.”

“That doesn’t sound fun.” I point out

“Doesn’t mean I can’t make it fun.” Mary retorted

I shrugged, not knowing how to reply to that. For the rest of the day Mary and I worked at it until she had to head home. I never liked working at car parts, but she loved it. Mary always loved the mechanical aspect of things. Maybe she should’ve been a suspect when things first started to happen.

Mrs. Forrest, Mary’s mechanics teacher, ended up hospitalized three months later. I never learned too many of the details, but I remember when the cops came to my door. They asked me if I knew her, knew anyone who had a grudge against her in her class, all of that. Apparently a fuse blew while she was grading a project, and she couldn’t remember which one went off.

Everyone knew it was some sort of foul play, but no one knew who it was. I never suspected Mary, and maybe it never was her, but everything else lined up so well. She just seemed so worried. She was my best friend, how could I suspect her? Why would I? Surely the police would figure it out and make an arrest, but they never did.

More incidents occurred, all to teachers. Mrs. Forrest was the only one who taught Mary, but all of them had a similar case. Something blew in their house, and their face became heavily scarred as a result.

After the fourth incident, Mary started acting weird. She became fixated on her face. Whenever she came over she’d pick and scratch at it. Her face became red and raw. My dad started to buy her face creams, and he even considered talking to her parents. I didn’t know why he worried so much. I didn’t know why then.

Once the school year ended, the incidents stopped. Mary became more aggressive to other students in our year, but never to me. Then junior year began. It was going to be our first year having a prom. We were gonna go together, as we always did with homecoming.

Even then, we still treated homecoming as serious as we could. We went dress shopping where we always did. It was this small store owned by Ms. Ellen and her grandkids. Ms. Ellen would always make the most intricate dresses, and we loved them.

We were looking through the store, every year Ms. Ellen would make something new and we were excited to see what it was. This time all of her dresses had some sort of bow motif. Mary found a sleeveless red dress with a large frilly skirt, the waist was wrapped with a black ribbon with a bow in the back. It was beautiful, and Mary looked beautiful in it when she tried it on. I ended up with a blue dress, it was the same design as Mary’s, but with a white ribbon instead.

Mary seemed blank that day, staring into space almost every minute. I wasn’t bothered, she always spaced out. Yet this was different. It was longer, and she seemed focused on whatever she was staring at. Once I saw her moving her jaw up and down, almost like a dummy being puppeteered to talk.

It was creepy, but maybe it was nothing. I ignored it. I ignored every sign until it was too late, until homecoming came and I saw what she became. Maybe if I noticed sooner, maybe if I said something, maybe she’d be ok.

Homecoming was the same as always, at first. I got there before Mary, sticking by the food table as I waited for her. Music was going, and it covered up the squeaking of shoes on the gym floor. It was dark, only being lit up with colored spot lights.

I was focused on the doors, and soon enough they opened. Into the gym stepped Mary. She was completely barefoot, dirt and grass sticking to her feet, her hair was barely brushed, draping down her masked face, yet her dress was perfect, having no stains or tears. It was almost like a doll you played with too much.

For some reason, I didn’t walk over to her. My feet were glued to the ground. She slowly moved her hand to her face, her fingernails looked sharp and like they were stained with something. Mary carefully removed her mask, hair falling to the side.

She didn’t have a face. It wasn’t there. I mean it was there but it just wasn’t. Instead of the red and raw skin, there wasn’t any skin at all. Instead rough, patchy, bleeding flesh. She tore off her own face.

A chaperone quickly went to check on her, while another took out his phone to presumably call an ambulance. Before the chaperone approaching her could even get a word out, Mary lunged at her. She was like an animal, tearing at the screaming chaperones face.

The homecoming turned to chaos. Some braver students attempted to shove Mary away, only to get stabbed by the knife she wielded. I can’t believe I didn’t notice it at first. Many ran, the chaperone calling 911 got through. I’m still convinced that’s why so many survived. I doubt we would have without him. Mary got off of the chaperone she had mauled, and began to charge at whoever she could. She stabbed, she tore, she fought. Mary was like an animal. I didn’t run like so many others. No one tried to get me.

Soon enough, Mary and I were the only breathing things in that room. Bodies littered the ground, their faces all bloodied or gone. Mary limped forward towards me, I guess someone got a lucky hit. She tilted her head, hazel eyes shining in the remaining lights.

I finally managed to convince my body to cooperate, taking a step backwards. “Mary..?” I began slowly.

She let out an animalistic grunt, the muscles around her eyes contracting in what I could only assume was a smile.

For some reason, she didn’t seem like a threat to me. Don’t get me wrong, I was terrified, but I just knew she wouldn’t hurt me. Somehow I knew. I didn’t step closer, I wasn’t stupid, but when she got right in my face I didn’t step away.

She reached a hand up to my hair, tracing through it. Her fingers twirled through the blonde and her muscles contracted in that smile. Her fingers were sharp, almost like claws. I’m not sure what happened, I don’t think I’ll ever know what happened.

When the sirens approached, Mary jerked away from me and ran. Police rushed into the gym, and when they saw me as the only living thing there they took me away and wrapped me in a shock blanket. It wasn’t cold, but the heavy and uncomfortable fabric soothed me. I told the police what I saw, and when the other survivors confirmed the story the police got off my back.

There weren’t too many causalities, according to the police. Apparently only a few people actually died before making it to the hospital, I think our local news put it to three deaths? I don’t think anything’s made it to the big news networks, we’re a small town and it’s not like death is uncommon these days. They’d want something big, I don’t really know if this qualifies.

They’re still looking for Mary, and even if they haven’t found her it’s only been a month. We all know she’s still out there. They would have more answers, but when the police went to her parents house they found their fate. According to the police there were symbols tattooed on their backs.

I know my dad knows something about it, but he won’t tell me anything. He says it’s not worth it. He says Mary’s gone now. I know she’s not. I know she’s still out there, still in this neighborhood, still lurking. I know she won’t hurt me, but anyone could be next. I don’t know what to do. I still care about Mary, and I know she cares about me but I can’t just go after her can I?

I’m scared, I just want my friend back. How am I supposed to go back to school? How am I meant to recover?

I don’t know. Everything went away, everything I cared about left me and my dad doesn’t even care enough to tell me what he knows.",5,1731010824.0,nosleep,1,0.78,False

I understand no one here is my realtor and would just appreciate anyone’s advice if they feel like giving it, thanks!

We are 28f and 30m (no children except cats and dogs) looking for a very walkable neighborhood maybe close to bars/breweries, a college campus, and good non-chain restaurant food. Close to a LGBT community, DnD clubs, coffee shops, etc is a bonus as well. Anywhere with great atmosphere, diversity, and culture. 

We will probably rent in the meantime but are moving from Mississippi so our budget isn’t amazing right now probably looking under $1400/mo (hopefully not too tall of an order)

Also, if there is another city or town that fits the bill please let me know! Thanks so much 🥹",17,1731010360.0,norfolk,37,0.73,False

I recently bought this bracelet from AliX for a Mod I am going for a lady. While resizing I noticed the bracelet has no more links I can remove (some are permanently fixed) so my only option left is trying to see if I can move (in the photo) clasp towards the other side.
Can anyone please help as I am not sure which side will be able to move and if it's even possible.
The railing inside the clasp suggests it's possible.
I will buy coffee or beer (PayPal) if your suggestion works 🙏🏽",4,1731010232.0,SeikoMods,5,1.0,False
