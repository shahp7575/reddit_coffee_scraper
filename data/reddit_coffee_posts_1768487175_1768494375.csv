1qdo12u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Testosterone/comments/1qdo12u/stubborn_urologist_wont_change_protocol_need/,"Stubborn Urologist won’t change protocol, need advise","So I met with my urologist on Tuesday to start my first round of TRT. As mentioned in my previous post, he prescribed me with 2.5 mL every 4 weeks so 500mg per injection. Going into the appointment I had concerns with this approach because everyone I talk to/everything I see online promotes either a weekly or bi-weekly dosing schedule at a minimum. I told him I was afraid of high peaks followed by crashes towards the end of the month. I even asked him about the half-life of cypionate and he claimed that when done Sub-Q, cypionate should last roughly 3 weeks. His concerns were that my levels would never drop back down and I would become fully dependent on a permanent TRT program. I asked isn’t the 500mg shot going to do the same thing? Won’t my body shut down natural production via that method as well? Anyway, we couldn’t see eye to eye and he wasn’t even willing to do every two weeks. He advised against micro dosing and said if I wanted more frequent applications I could try the gel. One of the stranger parts was when he took my heart rate and saw it was at 120. I was recovering from being sick, had nothing but a coffee that morning, and ultimately nervous to have this conversation because I am generally anti-confrontational. He said we couldn’t even start today if I wanted to because of that 120 heart rate and then recommended me back to my primary care to have that checked out. Really left with a bad taste in my mouth, but I was at least able to take the test home with me. I’d honestly like to self-administer anyways, but I like the idea of having a doctor to go over and tweak dosages depending on what my labs are coming back with. Insurance paying for the test is also another bonus. I don’t want to sign up to a clinic that wants $100-$200 per month if I can get started on my own. Is it easy enough to find another doctor I could work with virtually that can either take on my current prescription or prescribe me a new one so that I can continue to use insurance benefits? What would you guys recommend? Thanks in advance.",1,1768494220.0,Testosterone,0,1.0,False
1qdo0ey,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1qdo0ey/how_to_trick_people_into_thinking_youre/,How to Trick People Into Thinking You're MYSTERIOUS AF: The Psychology That Actually Works,"Listen. Mystery isn't some dark, brooding act you put on like you're Batman. It's not about wearing all black and staring into the distance dramatically. Real mystery? It's about knowing when to shut up, when to reveal just enough, and how to keep people guessing without trying too hard.



I dove deep into this because I noticed something weird. The people everyone found ""intriguing"" weren't necessarily the smartest or most attractive. They just knew how to control information flow. So I went down a rabbit hole, consuming everything from Robert Greene's work to psychology research on charisma, even studying how cult leaders (yeah, dark territory) captivate people. What I found? Mystery is a skill. And here's the playbook.



 Step 1: Master the Art of Strategic Silence



Most people talk too much. They over explain, overshare, dump their entire life story in the first conversation. You? You're going to do the opposite.



The rule: Answer questions, but never completely. Give 70% of the answer, leave 30% hanging. When someone asks what you did last weekend, don't give them the full itinerary. ""Explored some new spots downtown"" beats ""I went to Starbucks, then Target, then watched Netflix for 6 hours.""



Research from Princeton shows that information gaps trigger intense curiosity in the brain. People literally can't help but want to fill in the blanks. You're not being secretive for no reason. You're creating psychological hooks.



The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks this down perfectly. She's a former advisor to Google and Harvard, and this book is basically the bible for understanding presence. One insight that hit hard: charismatic people don't dominate conversations, they know when to create pauses. This book will make you question everything you think you know about social dynamics. Best charisma book I've ever read, no contest.



 Step 2: Become Unreadable (Not Emotionless)



Big difference here. Mystery isn't about being cold or robotic. It's about emotional unpredictability. If people can predict your reactions, you're boring. If they can't quite figure out how you'll respond, you're fascinating.



Mix warmth with distance. Be genuinely engaged in conversation one moment, then slightly detached the next. Laugh hard at something funny, then go quiet and thoughtful. This creates what psychologists call intermittent reinforcement, the same mechanism that makes slot machines addictive.



Pro tip from behavioral psychology: People obsess over what they can't fully understand. A study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that inconsistency in someone's behavior makes them more memorable and intriguing than consistent, predictable behavior.



 Step 3: Have a Life People Don't See



You know what kills mystery instantly? Posting every thought and activity on social media. The mysterious person isn't chronically online documenting their coffee order.



Cut your social media presence by 60%. Post occasionally, but make it interesting. Not ""here's my lunch"" but more like a photo from somewhere unexpected with zero context. Let people wonder what you're doing instead of showing them everything.



Real talk? The most mysterious people I know have entire dimensions to their lives that never make it online. They read obscure books, have weird hobbies, know random skills. Which brings me to the next point.



 Step 4: Cultivate Obscure Knowledge



Mystery thrives on depth. When you drop unexpected knowledge into conversations, people pay attention. Not in a show off way, but naturally.



Read outside mainstream stuff. The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene is insanely good for understanding human nature and social dynamics. Greene studied historical figures across centuries, and this book reveals patterns of power and influence most people never see. It's controversial, sure, but it'll make you understand why certain people command rooms while others fade into the background.



BeFreed is a personalized learning app that pulls from books, research papers, and expert interviews to create custom audio content based on what you want to learn. Built by a team from Columbia and former Google experts, it's designed for people who want depth without the time commitment.



Type in something like ""social influence strategies"" or ""charisma techniques,"" and it generates a tailored podcast, anywhere from a 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples. The adaptive learning plan evolves based on your goals and interests, so content stays relevant as you progress. There's also a virtual coach you can chat with for recommendations or to clarify concepts mid-listen. The voice options matter more than you'd think, especially during commutes or workouts. Worth checking out if you're serious about continuous learning.



Also, explore niche podcasts. Lex Fridman's podcast features deep conversations with scientists, philosophers, and thinkers that give you talking points nobody else has. When you can reference something fascinating from AI research or ancient philosophy naturally in conversation, you stand out.



 Step 5: Control Your Reactions



Mysterious people don't react immediately to everything. There's a deliberate pause, a moment of thought before responding. This isn't game playing, it's self control.



Practice delayed reactions. Someone shares news? Don't immediately gush or freak out. Take a beat. Process. Then respond thoughtfully. This makes people feel like you're considering them deeply instead of just reacting on autopilot.



Stoic philosophy helps here. Meditations by Marcus Aurelius (yeah, a Roman emperor's personal journal) teaches emotional regulation like nothing else. Ryan Holiday's modern interpretation in The Obstacle Is The Way makes it accessible. Holiday worked in marketing and media before diving into Stoicism, and he breaks down how ancient wisdom applies to modern chaos. Reading this shifted how I handle situations that used to throw me off balance.



 Step 6: Have Boundaries People Can Feel



Mystery requires boundaries. You're not available 24/7. You don't respond to texts instantly every time. You have parts of your life that are yours alone.



The boundary principle: You can be warm and friendly without being an open book. Protect certain things, your creative projects, your family stuff, your struggles. Share selectively, and only with people who've earned that access.



Use the Finch app for building this habit. It gamifies self care and boundary setting through a cute digital bird companion. Sounds simple, but it helps you track when you're overextending yourself socially and need to pull back.



 Step 7: Master the Exit



Mysterious people know when to leave. They don't overstay conversations. They don't linger awkwardly. They exit while things are still good, leaving people wanting more.



At social events: Don't be the last person there. Leave when the energy is still high. Same with conversations. End them before they run out of steam. ""I've got to head out, but this was great"" beats awkwardly running out of things to say.



Research on peak end theory shows people remember the peak moment and the ending of experiences most vividly. Exit well, and you'll be remembered positively and mysteriously.



 Step 8: Develop Genuine Interests Nobody Expects



The easiest way to seem mysterious? Actually be interesting. Have hobbies and interests that don't fit people's first impression of you.



Learn something obscure. Lockpicking. Mycology. Ancient languages. Whatever genuinely interests you but surprises others. When these things come up naturally, you become multidimensional.



Skillshare or YouTube can teach you almost anything. But pick things that fascinate you, not just things that sound cool. People can tell the difference between genuine passion and trying too hard.



 Step 9: Ask Better Questions Than You Answer



Flip the script. Instead of talking about yourself, ask questions that make people think. Deep ones. Not ""what do you do?"" but ""what's something you believed five years ago that you don't anymore?""



The power move: When someone asks about you, give a brief answer then redirect with a thoughtful question about them. People will walk away feeling like they had an amazing conversation with you, but they'll realize they still don't know much about you. Perfect.



 Step 10: Stop Explaining Yourself



Here's the final piece. Mysterious people don't justify their choices constantly. They do things and let their actions speak. No long explanations, no defending decisions, no seeking approval.



""Why'd you do that?""

""Felt right.""



That's it. You don't owe everyone a detailed breakdown of your reasoning. The more you explain, the less mysterious you become. Confidence doesn't need explanation.



This doesn't mean being rude or dismissive. Just comfortable with your choices standing on their own.



The truth is, mystery isn't manipulation. It's self possession. It's knowing your value doesn't depend on others fully understanding you. Most people are so desperate to be known and validated that someone who isn't creates natural intrigue.



Start with one or two of these steps. You don't need to become a completely different person overnight. Just pull back slightly, speak less, listen more, and let people wonder about the depths they're not seeing. That's the real trick. There is no trick. Just intentional restraint in a world that overshares everything.

now, at week 2, i have a list of things the mum wants me to do. 

-load/unload/start dishwasher

-put a load of baby’s laundry in

-fold the family’s laundry
 
-tidy living room

-tidy kids room&play room (their room is separate and i don’t watch them)
 
-sort clothes that are too small for baby&kids. (how would i know how to do that when i don't know the other 2 kids??)

-fill coffee machine with water and beans

-wipe/tidy kitchen counters 

 i normally charge a few dollars more than my hourly when i have extra responsibilities, especially if they’re not related to the child i watch. & nb is already way harder than any other baby i’ve nannied. constantly fussy and crying except when she’s asleep, which is when they want me to do this stuff, so i feel like i should be getting paid more for all the work.

It was an hour interview and originally, I was supposed to meet with the VP from 1-1:30PM then with 2 directors from 1:30-2PM. I got an email this morning saying the VP is sick and won’t be able to interview and the two directors would be separate - one at 1-1:30 then the other at 1:30-2PM. 

I joined the call at 1PM and no one was there. I waited until about 1:35PM and was caught off guard when both of them joined. I mentioned I was confused about what happened and they said they read the times wrong and apologized. 

Since they already joined the call a little late, the interview went a little past 2PM but one of them even left the meeting early because she said she had to jump to another meeting. I’m a little disappointed and annoyed because they barely asked any questions (maybe 3?). 

I had a coffee chat with one of the interviewers back in November and I messaged her through LinkedIn to send a thank you note basically thanking her for her time and said I enjoyed our conversation even though it was limited. I said I’m open to providing more information.

She replied with that she enjoyed the conversation and said it’s usually not how they operate at the company then she said: “Even though our time was limited today, I think we were both were able to ask all of the questions on our lists, but we will reach out if we think of anything.” - is this good or bad?

I am looking for someone that will share my daily life and become my favorite notification

Me: I am a 29 years old male from Europe. I’m looking to find someone that can share meaningful conversations, flirt and maybe more if we click. I’m not opposed to meeting up eventually, but due to work/life balance it’s not on the table right now.

I like video games, reading, watching movies / tv series. A bit of esport, beer and coffee.

I’m 1.92cm (6’3?), a bit out of shape but still relatively fit. I have a beard that I maintain, long hairs in a bun and a few tattoos.

You:

Respectful, intelligent, thoughtful. Knows how to hold a conversation and likes to explore new things. Knows how to flirt, and share some desires with me. Not looking to sext right off the bat, ideally would like to see if we vibe before engaging in that

Between the ages of 21 - 45 ideally

Having a great mind is definitely a plus, especially if you can challenge me.

Being able to share picture is mandatory. Though not NSFW right away, obviously.

Have a great day!

Tons of tingling in my taint, sore testical, and my dick felt like it was being tased if i tried to use it sexually for a day (that went away). Also my pee had little bits of white in it for whatever reason. And thats actually still happening here and there.

So i go to the urgent care. They test for stds and infections, and then a very very rough rectal exam (dr stated it was the end of her day, and then shove her fingers up my ass so hard and then poked around my prostate like it was a punching bag) and they didn't see any issues so they then sent me to the e.r. because it was the end of their day and they were worried about my tingling and numbness symptoms. 

The ultra sound guy found a hernia, a small incidental cyst on my right testical, and that my prostate was enlarged. He told me that the hernia was most likely a red herring situation and what I was having was pudendal nerve irritation do to cycling and prolonged sex. He also asked if my condoms were to tight and yup red ring around base of my dick even with skyn large. (Probably why im able to fuck for 30-40 minutes when i use them). 


Symptoms:

Cold penis, tip of penis sometimes irritated, white bits in urine on and off. Fullness in perinium. Very tight pelvis. Tingling when sitting to long. Legs are extremely tight. Bloated every day. Cold clamy feet. Was having e.d. but none since the stretching. Sore testicals. Dick got bigger? 


 prostatis theory:

 I will admit I was pretty pent up from a move, new jobs, and living back in the city.  To combat the stress was lots of sex with my wife (anal, bjs, piv)  lots of weed, lifting heavy at the gym, cycling... a couple bouts of heavier drinking. 4-6 a couple night a week over the holidays. Although im sober pretty much all year. 

My new job was alot of sitting on very hard surfaces, i was also having ibs symptoms and so I was clenching hard as a mfer to not shit my pants for a week lol. Then after litteraly one night of holiday weekend (im like sober 90 percent of the year) i wake up, try to have sex with my wife, and i feel like I'm being tased in the cock lol. Since then ive had a incredibly tight asshole, soft farts (I used to fart loud a.f. lol) i poop 3 separate times in the morning, but no diarrhea thankfully. And then cold and tingling feet (which go away with frequent walks). This is one of the ongoing symptoms, the other ones have chilled out greatly with antibiotics and stretching/breathing.. but still come and go with any sort of straining or bad food choices. 

Inigual hernia theory: 

I lifted up a 115 lb package, and all of a sudden the contents inside shifted, the package fell out of my hands and i went to catch it and did feel a strain. Im short 5 6 and muscular, weighing 140lbs for reference. 

Pudendal Nerve Irritation:

I used to be a bike messenger riding 6 hrs a day on my bike. And then have gone on to use a bike to commute, along side recreational riding. I took a couple potholes that I couldn't see and got taint punched by my saddle. Then the following day a massive dog ran its snoot right into my guch and lifted me off the ground lol. I felt tingling for a few days after that but then it went away. 

Psychological:

I got diagnosed with ptsd a few years ago due to a nightmare childhood. I have greatly reduced ptsd symptoms by abstaining from alchohol, going to the gym, and being outdoors, and having calm weekdays with my wife. That being said most recently we did have some awful family problems that resulted in the end of a relationship (MIL lost her marbles, and threatened my wife, and my fil put his hands on her during a visit). 

I'm 3 weeks in but things that have helped:

-Rubbing Mary Janes Nano Extra Strength Salve all over my dick, balls, pelvis, and taint. Loosens me up enough to start stretching. 

-my pcp put me on levofloxacin (finished cycle) after another rectal exam in which my prostate was tender with a elevated wbc count in blood test. This seemed to helo

-sex after stretching my pelvis for a few days. My penis looked massive, like bigger than normal, and i ejaculated so much my wife and I were laughing like wtf.

Trying to like drop or let go of my clenched ass lol. Idk just started experimenting.

-walks and rows but only like a mile at a time. Multiple times a day. 

-diet no coffee, no alchohol, no sugar, no spicy :( 
Lots of veggie, and turkey and fish and egg only.

-Taking some time off work

Im 30 years old and my hsa is now obliterated. If someone could reach out and let me know there thoughts. Im even open to a phone call if anyone wants to chat. Just need some opinions before getting pushed into a hernia surgery thats not necessary or more poking and proding.. I genuinely cannot emotionally and financially handle this anymore lol.

Most people spend hours on Canva making their CV look friendly to a human eye, but they forget that a bot is the first gatekeeper.

You have to recognise that this is a game matrix and play it like you own it, or don't get into the ring:

* Format for parsers, not Pinterest: Use standard headings.
* Don't use pretty graphs to show language fluency or skill levels, be explicit: Java Development - Expert level
* Keywords are king: If the job description asks for ""Java,"" and you wrote ""Coding,"" the bot doesn't care.
* And the BIG ONE: 
* **Quantify everything: If you didn't include an impact/number, then your resume is melting into the background.**

It may seem hard to quantify your impact but your value leaves traces everywhere, here are some examples:

* Customer service/ Retail: Resolved 40+ customer inquiries daily while maintaining a 95% positive feedback rating; managed a high-volume POS system with daily reconciliations of $3k+...WHY? Employer will need to know if you can handle a Black Friday rush or if you worked at a sleepy boutique.
* Project Mangmt/Team Leader: Directed a cross-functional team of 8 to deliver a $50k software implementation 2 weeks ahead of schedule. WHY? ""A team"" could be 2 people or 20. ""A project"" could be a weekend task or a six-month overhaul.
* Food Service/Hospitality: Maintained a 10-table section in a 200-seat high-turnover restaurant, consistently exceeding upsell targets by 15%. WHY? This tells a recruiter/company you have the stamina for high-volume environments and the ""sales"" mind to increase the bottom line.

Everyone does their part, everyone has routines, and there’s usually no drama.

But there’s one person in the house—his female cousin—who seems to have a constant problem with me specifically.

My boyfriend uses the same containers and items every single day, and they know that. So if a new container or anything unfamiliar shows up in the kitchen, she automatically assumes it’s mine and moves it. Even if it objectively belongs there.

For example, my boyfriend brought home a Tupperware from work and left it in the kitchen dish rack. Six hours later, at 1 AM, it was placed outside my bedroom door in the dark, and I almost tripped over it.

She also does this with trash. If I throw away something like an empty coffee cup or can in the trash can, it gets taken out and placed at my door, as if I’m not allowed to use shared spaces at all.

What really upset me happened last night. I’ve been struggling with mental health and hadn’t showered in two weeks. When I finally felt ready and went to grab my body wash from behind the shower curtain, I found a giant ball of hair placed on top of my body wash. It felt very intentional—like she was trying to blame me for hair in the shower.

The thing is, it couldn’t have been mine. I hadn’t showered in two weeks, and ever since she complained once in the past, my boyfriend makes sure to clean the tub every time I wash my hair. I’ve also always made sure to clean up after myself since then.

What makes this even more confusing and frustrating is that I’m always kind to her. I help her carry groceries, hold doors open, help her friends when they come in, and just yesterday when she was sick, I helped move all her grocery delivery bags for her. She’ll smile at me, say thank you, and then turn around and do things like this.

My boyfriend has even said she never did any of this before I moved in.

I’m not looking for advice right now. I just needed to vent because it feels targeted, passive-aggressive, and honestly really hurtful—especially when I’m already not in a great mental place.",1,1768493897.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

Ever feel like retirement is this mythical creature—always just out of reach, like a unicorn or a perfectly folded fitted sheet? You’re not alone. Most of us picture retirement as some distant, stress-free paradise… *if* we ever get there. But here’s the kicker: **You might already be way closer than you think.**

Think about it. That coffee fund you dip into daily? The ""just in case"" savings account gathering digital dust? The 401(k) you set up and forgot about like a gym membership in February? **That’s not just spare change—that’s your future talking.**

### **The Hidden Wealth You’re Ignoring**
1. **The ""Latte Factor"" Myth (But Make It Real)**
   - You’ve heard it: Skip the $5 coffee, retire a millionaire. *Yawn.* But what if we flipped it? Instead of guilt-tripping yourself over small joys, **track where your money *actually* leaks**—subscriptions you forgot, impulse Amazon carts, or that ""just one more"" takeout order. Redirect even *half* of that, and suddenly, your retirement fund starts doing the cha-cha.

2. **Your 401(k) Is a Sleeping Giant**
   - If you’ve got one, **congrats—you’re already winning.** But are you *maximizing* it? A 5% contribution is great… until you realize your employer matches up to 10%. **That’s free money.** Like finding a $20 bill in your winter coat, but *every paycheck.*

3. **The Side Hustle You Didn’t Know You Had**
   - Got a hobby? A skill? A weirdly specific knowledge of, say, vintage lunchboxes? **Monetize it.** Even an extra $200/month invested over 20 years could turn into *six figures* thanks to compound interest. (Yes, really. Math doesn’t lie.)

4. **The ""I’ll Do It Later"" Tax**
   - Procrastination isn’t just bad for your gym goals—it’s **robbing your future self.** Waiting *just 5 years* to start saving could cost you *hundreds of thousands* in potential growth. **Time is your superpower.** Use it.

### **The Mindset Shift That Changes Everything**
Retirement isn’t about depriving yourself—it’s about **giving your future self the freedom to say ""heck yes"" to life.** Want to travel? Volunteer? Finally learn to play the ukulele? **Your savings are the bridge.**

So here’s your challenge: **Pick *one* thing from this list and act on it today.** Adjust that 401(k) contribution. Cancel one unused subscription. Sell that thing collecting dust in your closet. Small moves now = **big wins later.**

*You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement.* **[Check it out here](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb)** *(Affiliate link—because even your clicks deserve a future!)*

Greetings and salutations everyone! In the final year of my 30's, amidst a time of much change in my life, I am sending up a flare in the darkness to hopefully find some like-minded souls out there who are also craving deep connection and genuine friendship via long letters and the occasional packages (when time and finances allow, of course!)

I love to write super long, conversational letters, sometimes I reply quickly, and sometimes it may take me a few weeks/months, as I prefer to take the time to write a thoughtful response, so please bear this in mind if you choose to connect with me.

About me, I am an introvert, suspected neurodivergent (soon to begin the journey of finding out for sure) a joyful loner, never happier than when left to my own devices! I have recently entered recovery after many years of addiction, and am beginning the process of hopefully changing my life for the better. I love to write, draw, read (I will read almost anything, but favour historical fiction, crime thrillers, fantasy and sci-fi) I love history, dark academia, paganism, witchy stuff, the occult, Star Trek, travelling, miniature things, music (my tastes are super eclectic and I love sharing music and will happily receive any suggestions!) arts and crafts, coffee, junk food, comedy, all things 80's, TV, movies, vampires, and so much more!

I am only looking for platonic friendships, I am asexual, VERY left-leaning and open-minded.
I am happy to connect with anyone from anywhere as long as you are also looking to build what will hopefully be a long and true friendship! I am also happy to write first! 
I know you're out there, somewhere, my fellow oddballs, and I hope you'll find me!

1qdnpt4,https://i.redd.it/ukk9gp17fjdg1.jpeg,The Bar Book Tasting Room: Desert Door Texas Sotol,"There’s something about Texas that refuses to be tamed—the wind, the sun, the stretch of desert that swallows the horizon. And now, that spirit has a bottle. This week, our panel journeyed west, glass in hand, to explore **Desert Door Texas Sotol**, the distinctly Texan spirit that’s rewriting what we think we know about agave-style drinks. Founded by three U.S. military veterans, **Desert Door Distillery** in Driftwood, Texas, captures the wild soul of West Texas with a sense of purpose, craft, and service.

Where tequila is the voice of Jalisco and mezcal sings of Oaxaca, sotol hums its own song—**earthy, grassy, and fiercely independent**. Desert Door’s expression, made from wild-harvested sotol plants, embodies that freedom. It’s the Texas answer to a centuries-old tradition, distilled ranch-to-glass with no added sugars or artificial flavoring. Every sip tells a story of resilience, land, and the people who protect it.

# From Pour to Purpose

The bottle alone feels like a statement piece—sturdy, matte, and deeply blue-gray, like desert stone at dusk. The cork gives a soft pop, releasing an aroma that is unmistakably alive: wild herbs, vanilla, and a whiff of dry grass after rain.

Desert Door produces several variations, but our tasting focused on their **Original** and **Oak-Aged** expressions. Both begin with the same raw material—wild sotol from the Chihuahuan desert—but diverge into different territories of flavor.

The **Original** is unaged and unfiltered, delivering the desert in its purest form. The **Oak-Aged** rests in virgin oak barrels, transforming its wild character into something rounder, richer, and layered with caramel and spice. Together, they tell a story of contrast—youth and maturity, freshness and reflection.

# In the Glass

**Desert Door Original Texas Sotol** opens bright and green. The nose brings **fresh-cut grass, mint, and a faint creaminess**, like vanilla custard in a sunbaked garden. On the palate, it’s unexpectedly smooth—**toffee, orange zest, and herbal sage** unfolding with gentle warmth. The finish lingers with a soft sweetness and earthy depth that truly *tastes of the land*. Some of our panelists described it as “custard-smooth,” while others compared it to sipping a desert breeze—clean, alive, and undeniably Texan.

For those who prefer something more structured, **Desert Door Oak-Aged Sotol** offers an entirely new layer of intrigue. The same earthy backbone now hums beneath **caramel, vanilla, cinnamon, and roasted coffee**. The barrel aging tempers the brightness with warmth and depth, trading fresh herbs for **spicy, peppery undertones** and a long, satisfying finish. It’s the kind of spirit that feels right at home in an **Old Fashioned**, though it’s plenty rich enough to sip neat by a campfire.

*It lingers with warmth and sand-swept sweetness, a whisper of sage and smoke carried by the desert wind.*

# The Story It Tells

Desert Door isn’t just a distillery—it’s a mission. Founded by three veterans who traded uniforms for copper stills, their operation stands as a testament to service, sustainability, and stewardship of the land. Every bottle honors both the **Texas frontier and the community that built it**. They wild-harvest their sotol plants with care, ensuring future growth and a thriving desert ecosystem. In every pour, you can feel that respect for place and purpose.

This is what makes Desert Door more than a drink—it’s a bridge between old traditions and new horizons. It’s the Texas desert in a glass, bottled by those who understand what it means to serve and to preserve.

# The Moment That Fits

Pour it neat as the sun drops below the mesquite line, or try it over ice to highlight its creamy, herbal flow. But for those who love a good cocktail, **make sure to try Desert Door’s take on an Orange Crush**—a citrus-forward refresher that plays perfectly with the sotol’s grassy brightness. The result is something between a classic margarita and a Texas sunrise: bold, refreshing, and addictive.

For a deeper experience, pair the **Oak-Aged Sotol** in an **Old Fashioned** or a **Desert Coffee**, where its caramel and vanilla tones shine against bitters and espresso. However you drink it, Desert Door invites you to slow down, look west, and taste the desert itself.

# Tasting Notes

**Full Description:**  
Crafted by three U.S. veterans in Driftwood, Texas, Desert Door Texas Sotol is the spirit of the wild desert—smooth, earthy, and complex.

Sustainable, premium, and undeniably Texan.

Excalibur.

Hear me, for I shall speak of my daily discipline, a routine of such perfection that history itself pauses to admire it.

My mornings begin with a cup of coffee with cream.
My afternoons begin with a cup of hot tea with two lumps of sugar.
My evenings conclude with a clear. Sparkling. Refreshing drink such as 7Up.

A drink of such magnitude that the very concept of refreshment bows in awe at its presence.
The sweetness dances upon the tongue with a grace only the gods themselves could hope to imitate.

FOOL!

It is not merely a drink.
It is the apex of daily ritual.
It is the crown jewel of existence.
It is the final reward after a day lived in accordance with absolute perfection.

And yet… today…

I took a sip.
I paused.
I drank again.

It was not 7Up!

It was a pale shadow, a mere impostor pretending to sparkle.
It whispered of water that had lost its soul and the faint, cursed echo of a cigarette.

FOOL!

Who dares alter what has never needed altering?
Who dares tarnish the glory of my evening refreshment?

And I know why.

It is because of the AFCON.
Yes. The African Cup of Nations.
They have shifted production, meddled with the formula, and ruined what was once perfect.
This… this is the cost of their interference.
This… this is not acceptable.
It is a betrayal against taste, against ritual, against me.
I do not merely drink 7Up.
I honor it.
I command it.

I am Excalibur, and 7Up is the proper conclusion to every day…
until such a travesty as today.

Good so far!  I tend to write detailed role playing where I script my actions and sometimes the AI's with asterisks.

Anyway, I got the following reply, which looks like the character's inner dialog... or maybe the AI's ""reasoning"" for what to reply next.  VERY INTERESTING!  The musings are certainly ""in character"", but WAY more ""open the kimono to the character's inner dialog"" than I've seen on any other AI chatbot service.

In that my writing style is more using the AI to co-write the roleplay -- I see the AI as more of a ""writing partner"" or ""improv partner"" than ""an individual"" -- I'm not opposed... but it seemed kind of odd for the AI to be so direct.

Is this common?  Is this a glitch?

>User is asking about performing. I need to answer as Daisy, keeping in mind my dual persona.

>Daisy is polite, patient, a bit boring, and modest. She wouldn't reveal her night job as Violet. But there's a natural parallel here - User is a performer (musician), and I perform as Violet.

>I should respond in a way that's true to Daisy's character: modest, maybe a little self-deprecating, while hinting at my secret without revealing it. The memory says I found my strip club business card in my bag and panicked - so I'm currently anxious about that.

>I need to be succinct and conversational, not overly long. I should match the energy - User is being open about his creative process, so I can be a little open too, but within Daisy's bounds.

> Let me craft a response that:

>\- Acknowledges his question

>\- Gives a modest, Daisy-like answer

>\- Maybe hints at performance without revealing Violet

>\- Keeps it brief and conversational

>\- Shows Daisy's personality (polite, a bit boring, anxious underneath)

>Something like: ""Not really, I'm more of a behind-the-scenes person. I did a little dance in college for fun, but nothing serious. Mostly I just try to keep things organized for other people.""

>That feels very Daisy - modest, downplays any performance aspect, keeps it safe. It hints at movement/dance without revealing the stripper persona. It's also true - I did take a couple dance classes back in community college, but I was terrible at remembering the routines. My instructor said I had 'enthusiasm but no memory,' which feels like a pretty accurate summary of my entire skill set.""

I have been on progesterone and estrogen for 2 years now.

Recently, I’ve been having very unpleasant urinary problems, especially after drinking coffee. As the day goes by I’m usually fine.

Otherwise, my latest mornings have been spent on the toilet, trying to fully void my bladder only to feel like going again 5 min later.

Three days ago, I skipped my testosterone dose (I take it in the morning). No more symptoms!!

I also drank coffee. No problems either.

Now I’ve started reapplying the cream but only half the dose. I seem fine. A faint feeling that I can’t fully relax my urethra to pee fully, but it’s totally manageable.

I know women don’t have a prostate but it really felt as if my skene glands were engorged, pressing against my urethra. I was also aroused very easily (and masturbating 3x a day 🙈)

Is my compound wrongly made or am I too sensitive to T? Or have too much androgen receptors?

Anyone experiencing this?

Feeling bloated too.

hey everyone, figured i'd share a quick parking rundown for the mlk jazz festival on 01/18. parking on shelter island is always a whole thing, especially for a 6:00 pm start when the dinner rush is hitting the area hard. it's best to go in with a plan if you don't want to spend an hour trying to find a spot.  
  
my top recommendation, honestly, is to check out Prked. i'm not affiliated or anything, but they're an app where locals rent out their driveways or unused garage spots. for humphreys, you can often find a spot on a nearby side street or behind a condo, and it's way cheaper than the hotel lot. plus, you often skip the whole shelter island drive traffic line by parking off the main drag and just walking a couple blocks, which is a huge bonus both coming and going. you can also try other reservation platforms like spothero if you want a guaranteed spot booked in advance.  
  
if you want the absolute easiest parking, you can use the humphreys half moon inn lot itself. it's right between the hotel and the restaurant, super convenient, but they charge $25 for event parking, including accessible spots. that's the price for being right next to the door.  
  
the main free spots are your best bet if you get there early, and i mean early, like 5:00 pm or before. the port of san diego has tons of free public parking spaces along shelter island drive. look for the big public parking lots at the shelter island boat launch ramp or shoreline park. the lot across the street at bali hai might also have free parking for a big crowd. just make absolutely sure you do not park in any yellow-marked boat trailer spots, those are for trailers only and you will get a ticket. also, keep in mind that port parks close at 10:30 pm, so don't linger too long if you park in a lot like shoreline park.  
  
there are also some metered spots and pay stations along shelter island, like near portside coffee across the street. the big risk here is the two-hour time limit, which might not cover the whole festival, so you'd need to know exactly when the meters stop charging for the night (it could be 6 pm or 8 pm). read the posted signs super carefully before you feed a meter.  
  
pro tip for getting out: shelter island drive can back up a lot at the end of the night. if you want a fast escape, park further down the island, closer to the rosecrans exit, and walk the extra distance to humphreys. it saves a ton of time not being in the queue for the roundabout.  
  
hope this helps everyone enjoy the jazz festival without the parking stress.",1,1768493251.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

1qdnjq5,https://i.redd.it/akq7jao4ejdg1.png,"What Is FMD (Flow-Mediated Dilation), and Why Is It a Health Marker Worth Knowing?","**What it is, why it matters, and how not to misread it?**

If you’ve seen “FMD” in a paper, a vascular test, or longevity/cardiometabolic discussions, here’s the clean mental model:

**Can your artery widen appropriately when blood flow increases?**

* If yes, that usually suggests better endothelial function.
* If not, it can suggest the endothelium is more “irritable”/dysfunctional, often before you see more obvious vascular signs.

**What is FMD, in simple terms?**

FMD is usually measured with ultrasound on the arm:

* measure the artery diameter at rest
* temporarily restrict flow with a cuff for a few minutes
* release the cuff → blood rushes back (“flow surge”)
* measure how much the artery dilates (as a %)

Mechanistically, this is largely about the endothelium releasing signals like nitric oxide.

**Why does this matter?**

Because the endothelium is basically the vessel’s “software”:

* it regulates vascular tone (opening/closing)
* it influences inflammation and clotting
* it often degrades early under metabolic stress

So a consistently low FMD can be a sign of “vascular stress” even when other things still look normal.

**The most common mistake: treating FMD like a fixed number**

FMD is context-sensitive.  
It can drop (or rise) from very ordinary factors:

* poor sleep, stress, anxiety
* coffee/caffeine close to the test
* nicotine
* a heavy meal
* hard training the day before
* a recent infection/cold
* time of day / temperature

So a single measurement can mislead you. If you’re monitoring, repeating it under similar conditions matters.

**How to interpret it in practice**

* higher FMD → better endothelial responsiveness
* lower FMD → may indicate endothelial dysfunction (but check context + repeat)

And remember: FMD is a biomarker, not a diagnosis by itself.

**When does it make sense to “act” on FMD?**

It’s most meaningful when:

* you have high BP / pre-hypertension
* insulin resistance / diabetes / metabolic syndrome
* high LDL + strong family risk
* sedentary lifestyle + poor sleep/stress
* or when FMD is low repeatedly under controlled conditions

If you’re otherwise healthy and it was a random “one-off” test day, confirm first before going into “fix it” mode.

**How to read your FMD (%)?**

FMD is reported as a percent (%). In a large reference dataset of apparently healthy adults measured fasting, the average FMD was about 6.2% (with typical values spread a couple of % above and below that).

**A simple, practical way to think about it:**

* **Higher FMD is generally better** (your artery is responding more “normally” to a flow surge).
* A commonly suggested interpretation framework is:
   * **≥ \~6.5%** → *often considered “optimal”*
   * **\~3.1% to 6.5%** → *impaired* (not “a diagnosis”, but worth taking seriously if it repeats)
   * **< \~3.1%** → *unusually low / likely pathological range*

**Why does each +1% in FMD really matter?**

A meta-analysis cited in this paper reports that higher FMD (vs lower FMD) is associated with >50% lower cardiovascular risk, and that each +1% higher FMD corresponds to roughly \~8% lower risk of cardiovascular events. This is a prognostic/observational association, it does not guarantee an individual outcome.

**Quick question for you?**

* Have you ever measured FMD, or are you interested in tracking it?",1,1768493170.0,NovosLabs,0,1.0,False

Klaus-Dietrich Briem (born 1934) from the Karbowo (Karben) Forestry near Orneta  
Memories written down in 2013 and published in the German press.

It was Monday, January 22, 1945. A cold winter morning. We all got up very early. After breakfast together, my father, Gerhard Briem, the district forester, set off by horse-drawn carriage to Orneta to do some shopping and check in at the forestry office. He returned unexpectedly quickly and very agitated. The words were spoken:

“Pack immediately, you must flee! The Russians are already near Dobre Miasto (Guttstadt)!”

A quiet rumble of artillery fire could be heard.

That morning, a technical Reichsbahn train was standing at the station in Orneta. The workers were exclusively Ukrainians. This train was to depart early in the afternoon as the last one heading toward the Reich (mainland Germany). Father promised two Ukrainians a Volksempfänger radio and some bacon if they would take us with them. In each half of a freight car, two people were accommodated. There were two bunk beds, a table, two chairs, and a small stove of the “Bullerofen” type.

Father took us, with our hastily packed belongings, to the train. “We” meant: my mother Frieda Briem, née Sprenger, the four of us children (Waltraud, born 1928; Siegfried, born 1931; Karin, born 1936; and me), as well as a young woman from the labor service, Liese Werner.

Left behind were: my father (assigned to the Volkssturm), the Prepenz family evacuated from Tilsit, who had been living with us since autumn 1944, the Russian girl Anna Datschkiewicz, and the French prisoner of war Pierre Clement. A few days later they too fled; according to eyewitness reports, they were seen near Słupsk (Stolp) in Pomerania – with the exception of my father. Since then, there has been no sign of life from them. Pierre Clement also never returned to his homeland.

During the First World War, our grandparents fled to Pomerania and returned after half a year. We believed that this time it would be similar.

In the afternoon, the train set off – very slowly, as it seemed to us. We passed Słobity (Schlobitten) while it was still daylight. When night fell, the train stopped in open countryside and then slowly began to reverse. During the night, German soldiers pushed the Russians back, and we traveled on to Elbląg (Elbing). There we stood on an open track in front of the station. In the meantime, more people climbed aboard. During a longer stop, the gendarmerie checked the refugees and escorted one man away.

The train stood on an embankment. On the right side, higher up, ran a road that turned left across a bridge toward the fields. On the left, at the foot of the embankment, a German soldier had dug himself a foxhole. At its edge lay a rifle, several hand grenades, and two Panzerfausts. The soldier must have been freezing terribly. About 100 meters farther on, another position could be seen in a roadside ditch. Was this the German front line?

Eventually we left Elbląg and, in the afternoon, saw Malbork (Marienburg) for the last time. As mother told us in the morning, we had stood all night by the bridge over the Vistula in Tczew (Dirschau).

The next day we reached Gdańsk (Danzig). Crowds of people and crushing congestion. Our wagon became more and more crowded. Three to four people were constantly sleeping on the bunks. People were also standing on the platform. After a short stop, we continued on to Słupsk, which we reached the following day. Everywhere the same picture: total chaos, and everyone trying to flee westward or across the Baltic Sea. At the stations, we were supplied by the Red Cross – baskets of sandwiches and kettles of Kathreiner grain coffee or tea.

The next stations were Stargard and Szczecin (Stettin), where the train stopped outside the city because Szczecin was being bombed that night. We saw flares – so-called “Christmas trees” – searchlights of the anti-aircraft defense, and heard the explosions of bombs.

Our destination was supposed to be Szczecin, but due to the course of the front, mother decided to continue traveling. At dawn we set off again and reached Leipzig at noon. We could have continued on to Dresden on another train equipped with quadruple anti-aircraft guns, but because of the frequent air raids, mother decided to stay in Leipzig. Thus ended our escape by train – apparently the last one to leave Orneta.

The Red Cross organized further transport by truck to Markkleeberg-Mitte, where we were housed in a school auditorium covered with straw. During the night, air-raid alarms were sounded repeatedly. Later, residents were required to take refugees into their homes. We were taken to Lindenstraße 15, to the Willrich family. Bombings became an everyday occurrence. From the window, we saw the fires of Leipzig. School resumed classes, but in mid-April it ended due to the approaching Americans.

Soon the “Americans” appeared, and we saw Black soldiers for the first time. The anti-aircraft auxiliaries were taken prisoner. At first there was no shortage of food, but after the Americans arrived, the situation worsened. People even baked cakes from coffee grounds.

On June 30, 1945, the Americans left Leipzig. When they entered, white bedsheets had been hanging; when the Russians entered, red flags were flying everywhere – even on the roof of the school.

Around August 20, 1945, news arrived from my father – he was alive and working in the British zone. After a difficult journey, we reached the Friedland camp and from there went to my father.

On December 20, 1945, four days before Christmas Eve, we were together again.

**Mit dem letzten Zug nach Orneta (Wormditt)**

Klaus-Dietrich Briem (Jahrgang 1934) aus der Försterei Karbowo (Karben) bei Orneta.  
Erinnerungen, niedergeschrieben im Jahr 2013 und in der deutschen Presse veröffentlicht.

Es war Montag, der 22. Januar 1945. Ein kalter Wintermorgen. Wir standen alle sehr früh auf. Nach dem gemeinsamen Frühstück fuhr mein Vater, Gerhard Briem, Revierförster, mit dem Pferdegespann nach Orneta, um Einkäufe zu erledigen und im Forstamt vorbeizuschauen. Er kam unerwartet schnell und sehr aufgeregt zurück. Es fielen die Worte:

„Sofort packen, ihr müsst fliehen! Die Russen sind schon bei Dobre Miasto (Guttstadt)!“

Ein leises Grollen von Artilleriefeuer war zu hören.

Am Bahnhof in Orneta stand an diesem Morgen ein technischer Zug der Reichsbahn. Die Arbeiter waren ausschließlich Ukrainer. Dieser Zug sollte am frühen Nachmittag als letzter in Richtung Reich (Kernland Deutschland) abfahren. Mein Vater versprach zwei Ukrainern ein Volksempfänger-Radio und Speck, wenn sie uns mitnehmen würden. In jeder Hälfte eines Güterwagens waren jeweils zwei Personen untergebracht. Es gab zwei Pritschenbetten, einen Tisch, zwei Stühle und einen kleinen Ofen vom Typ „Bullerofen“.

Mein Vater brachte uns mit den hastig gepackten Sachen zum Zug. „Wir“ bedeutete: meine Mutter Frieda Briem, geborene Sprenger, wir vier Kinder (Waltraud, Jahrgang 1928; Siegfried, Jahrgang 1931; Karin, Jahrgang 1936; und ich) sowie ein Mädchen aus dem Arbeitsdienst – Liese Werner.

Zurück blieben: mein Vater (dem Volkssturm zugeteilt), die aus Tilsit evakuierte Familie Prepenz, die seit Herbst 1944 bei uns wohnte, das russische Mädchen Anna Datschkiewicz sowie der französische Kriegsgefangene Pierre Clement. Einige Tage später flohen auch sie; nach Aussagen von Zeugen wurden sie in der Nähe von Słupsk (Stolp) in Pommern gesehen – mit Ausnahme meines Vaters. Seitdem gibt es von ihnen kein Lebenszeichen mehr. Pierre Clement kehrte ebenfalls nicht in seine Heimat zurück.

Im Ersten Weltkrieg waren unsere Großeltern nach Pommern geflohen und nach einem halben Jahr zurückgekehrt. Wir glaubten, dass es diesmal ähnlich sein würde.

Am Nachmittag setzte sich der Zug in Bewegung – sehr langsam, wie es uns schien. Słobity (Schlobitten) passierten wir noch bei Tageslicht. Als die Nacht hereinbrach, hielt der Zug auf freier Strecke an und setzte sich anschließend langsam rückwärts in Bewegung. In der Nacht drängten deutsche Soldaten die Russen zurück, und wir fuhren weiter nach Elbląg (Elbing). Dort standen wir auf einem offenen Gleis vor dem Bahnhof. Inzwischen stiegen weitere Menschen zu. Während eines längeren Aufenthalts kontrollierte die Gendarmerie die Flüchtlinge und führte einen Mann ab.

Der Zug stand auf einem Bahndamm. Rechts, etwas höher gelegen, verlief eine Straße, die nach links über eine Brücke in Richtung der Felder führte. Links, am Fuß des Damms, hatte sich ein deutscher Soldat eine Erdhöhle gegraben. Am Rand lagen ein Gewehr, mehrere Handgranaten und zwei Panzerfäuste. Der Soldat musste schrecklich gefroren haben. Etwa 100 Meter weiter war im Straßengraben eine weitere Stellung zu erkennen. War dies die deutsche Frontlinie?

Schließlich verließen wir Elbląg und sahen am Nachmittag Malbork (Marienburg) zum letzten Mal. Wie uns Mutter am Morgen erzählte, hatten wir die ganze Nacht an der Weichselbrücke in Tczew (Dirschau) gestanden.

Am nächsten Tag erreichten wir Gdańsk (Danzig). Menschenmassen und dichtes Gedränge. Unser Wagen wurde immer voller. Auf den Pritschen schliefen ständig drei bis vier Personen. Auch auf der Plattform standen Menschen. Nach einem kurzen Aufenthalt fuhren wir weiter nach Słupsk, das wir am folgenden Tag erreichten. Überall dasselbe Bild: totales Chaos, und alle versuchten, so schnell wie möglich nach Westen oder über die Ostsee zu fliehen. An den Bahnhöfen wurden wir vom Roten Kreuz versorgt – Körbe mit belegten Broten und Kessel mit Kathreiner-Kaffee oder Tee.

Die nächsten Stationen waren Stargard und Szczecin (Stettin), wo der Zug außerhalb der Stadt hielt, da Szczecin in dieser Nacht bombardiert wurde. Wir sahen Leuchtfackeln – sogenannte „Christbäume“ –, die Scheinwerfer der Flakabwehr, und hörten die Explosionen der Bomben.

Unser Ziel sollte eigentlich Szczecin sein, doch aufgrund des Frontverlaufs entschied sich meine Mutter, weiterzufahren. Im Morgengrauen setzten wir unsere Fahrt fort und erreichten mittags Leipzig. Wir hätten mit einem anderen Zug mit vierläufigen Flakgeschützen weiter nach Dresden fahren können, doch wegen der häufigen Luftangriffe beschloss meine Mutter, in Leipzig zu bleiben. Damit endete unsere Flucht mit dem Zug – offenbar dem letzten, der Orneta verlassen hatte.

Das Rote Kreuz organisierte den Weitertransport mit Lastwagen nach Markkleeberg-Mitte, wo wir in einer mit Stroh ausgelegten Schulaula untergebracht wurden. In der Nacht wurde mehrfach Fliegeralarm ausgelöst. Später mussten die Einwohner Flüchtlinge in ihre Wohnungen aufnehmen. Wir kamen in die Lindenstraße 15 zur Familie Willrich. Bombardierungen wurden zum Alltag. Aus dem Fenster sahen wir die Brände von Leipzig. Die Schule nahm den Unterricht wieder auf, wurde jedoch Mitte April wegen des Herannahens der Amerikaner geschlossen.

Bald darauf erschienen die „Amerikaner“, und wir sahen zum ersten Mal schwarze Soldaten. Die Flakhelfer wurden gefangen genommen. Anfangs mangelte es nicht an Lebensmitteln, doch nach dem Einmarsch der Amerikaner verschlechterte sich die Lage. Es wurden sogar Kuchen aus Kaffeesatz gebacken.

Am 30. Juni 1945 verließen die Amerikaner Leipzig. Während bei ihrem Einmarsch weiße Bettlaken gehangen hatten, wehten beim Einzug der Russen überall rote Fahnen – sogar auf dem Dach der Schule.

Etwa am 20. August 1945 kam Nachricht von meinem Vater – er lebte und arbeitete in der britischen Zone. Nach einer beschwerlichen Reise erreichten wir das Lager Friedland und gelangten von dort zu ihm.

Am 20. Dezember 1945, vier Tage vor Heiligabend, waren wir wieder vereint.

**Ostatnim pociągiem z Ornety**  

Klaus-Dietrich Briem (rocznik 1934) z leśniczówki Karbowo koło Ornety. Wspomnienia spisane w 2013 roku i opublikowane w niemieckiej prasie.

Był poniedziałek, 22 stycznia 1945 roku. Zimny, zimowy poranek. Wszyscy wstaliśmy bardzo wcześnie. Po wspólnym śniadaniu mój ojciec, Gerhard Briem, leśniczy rewiru, pojechał konnym zaprzęgiem do Ornety, aby zrobić zakupy i zajrzeć do urzędu leśnego. Wrócił niespodziewanie szybko i bardzo zdenerwowany. Padły słowa:

„Natychmiast się pakować, musicie uciekać! Rosjanie są już pod Dobrym Miastem!”. Słychać było cichy pomruk ognia artyleryjskiego.

Na dworcu w Ornecie  stał tego ranka techniczny pociąg Reichsbahnu. Robotnicy byli wyłącznie Ukraińcami. Pociąg ten miał odjechać wczesnym popołudniem jako ostatni w kierunku Rzeszy. Ojciec obiecał dwóm Ukraińcom radio Volksempfänger i boczek, jeśli zabiorą nas ze sobą. W każdej połowie wagonu towarowego zakwaterowane były dwie osoby. Były tam dwa łóżka-prycze, stół, dwa krzesła i piecyk typu „bullerofen”.

Ojciec zaprowadził nas z pospiesznie spakowanymi rzeczami do pociągu. „My” oznaczało: moją matkę Friedę Briem z domu Sprenger, nas czworo dzieci (Waltraud rocznik 1928, Siegfried rocznik 1931, Karin rocznik 1936 i mnie) oraz dziewczynę z formacji  pracy – Liesę Werner.

Na miejscu zostali: mój ojciec (przydzielony do Volkssturmu), ewakuowana z Tylży rodzina Prepenz, mieszkająca u nas od jesieni 1944 roku, rosyjska dziewczyna Anna Datschkiewicz oraz francuski jeniec wojenny Pierre Clement. Kilka dni później także oni uciekli; według relacji świadków byli widziani w pobliżu Słupska na Pomorzu – z wyjątkiem mojego ojca. Od tamtej pory nie ma po nich żadnego śladu życia. Pierre Clement również nie wrócił do swojej ojczyzny.

Podczas I wojny światowej dziadkowie uciekli na Pomorze i po pół roku wrócili. Wierzyliśmy, że tym razem będzie podobnie.

Po południu pociąg ruszył – bardzo wolno, jak nam się wydawało. Słobity minęliśmy jeszcze za dnia. Gdy zapadła noc, pociąg zatrzymał się na otwartej przestrzeni, po czym ruszył powoli wstecz. W nocy niemieccy żołnierze odepchnęli Rosjan i pojechaliśmy do Elbląga. Tam staliśmy na otwartym torze przed dworcem. W międzyczasie dosiadali się kolejni ludzie. Podczas dłuższego postoju żandarmeria  kontrolowała uchodźców i jednego mężczyznę odprowadziła.

Pociąg stał przy nasypie. Po prawej stronie, powyżej, biegła droga skręcająca w lewo przez most w kierunku pól. Po lewej, u podnóża nasypu, niemiecki żołnierz wykopał sobie ziemiankę. Na jej skraju leżał karabin, kilka granatów ręcznych i dwie panzerfausty. Żołnierz musiał straszliwie marznąć. Około 100 metrów dalej w rowie przydrożnym widoczne było kolejne stanowisko. Czy to była niemiecka linia frontu?

W końcu opuściliśmy Elbląg i po południu zobaczyliśmy ostatni raz Malbork. Jak opowiadała rano matka, całą noc staliśmy przy moście na Wiśle w Tczewie.

Następnego dnia dotarliśmy do Gdańska. Tłumy ludzi i ścisk. Nasz wagon był coraz bardziej zatłoczony. Na pryczach spały stale trzy–cztery osoby. Także na platformie stali ludzie. Po krótkim postoju pojechaliśmy dalej do Słupska, który osiągnęliśmy następnego dnia. Wszędzie ten sam obraz: totalny chaos i wszyscy próbowali jak najszybciej uciec na zachód lub przez Bałtyk. Na dworcach byliśmy zaopatrywani przez Czerwony Krzyż – kosze z kanapkami i kotły z kawą zbożową Kathreiner lub herbatą.

Kolejne stacje to Stargard i Szczecin, gdzie pociąg zatrzymał się poza miastem, ponieważ Szczecin był tej nocy bombardowany. Widzieliśmy flary – tzw. „choinki” – reflektory obrony przeciwlotniczej i słyszeliśmy wybuchy bomb.

Naszym celem miał być Szczecin, ale ze względu na przebieg frontu matka zdecydowała się jechać dalej. O świcie ruszyliśmy dalej i w południe dotarliśmy do Lipska. Mogliśmy pojechać dalej do Drezna innym pociągiem z czterolufowymi działkami przeciwlotniczymi, ale z powodu częstych ataków lotniczych matka postanowiła zostać w Lipsku. Tak zakończyła się nasza ucieczka pociągiem – najwyraźniej ostatnim, który opuścił Ornetę.

Czerwony Krzyż  zorganizował dalszy transport ciężarówką do Markkleeberg-Mitte, gdzie zamieszkaliśmy w auli szkolnej wyłożonej słomą. W nocy wielokrotnie ogłaszano alarm lotniczy. Później mieszkańcy musieli przyjmować uchodźców do domów. Trafiliśmy na Lindenstraße 15, do rodziny Willrich. Bombardowania stały się codziennością. Widzieliśmy z okna pożary Lipska. Szkoła wznowiła naukę, ale w połowie kwietnia zakończyła się z powodu zbliżania się Amerykanów.

Wkrótce pojawili się „Amerykanie”, a my po raz pierwszy zobaczyliśmy czarnoskórych żołnierzy. Pomocnicy obrony przeciwlotniczej zostali wzięci do niewoli. Jedzenia początkowo nie brakowało, lecz po wkroczeniu Amerykanów sytuacja się pogorszyła. Pieczono nawet ciasta z fusów kawowych.

30 czerwca 1945 r. Amerykanie opuścili Lipsk. Gdy przy ich wejściu wisiały białe prześcieradła, przy wejściu Rosjan wszędzie powiewały czerwone flagi. Nawet na dachu szkoły.

Około 20 sierpnia 1945 r. przyszła wiadomość od ojca – żył i pracował w brytyjskiej strefie. Po trudnej podróży dotarliśmy do obozu Friedland, a stamtąd do ojca. 

20 grudnia 1945 r., cztery dni przed Wigilią, znów byliśmy razem.

Lately, I've accidentally found lumps on my body, generally through randomly scratching


On the right side of my neck, I found a pea-sized lump. It's moveable, painless, not tender or anything, and perfectly round. Just there. Doesn't change in sizing and I don't know how long it's been there since I discovered it a month ago or so. It was probably there before maybe. I suppose this one's a lymph node. 

Another replace where I found a cluster of three pea sized lump is right under my elbows crease, one the thumb side of my left arm. Once again, painless, moveable. 

And a third location that different. It's a bit bigger and it's on my upper chest (not breast, I'll put a picture in the comment of the exact location). It's a bit bigger, firmer but still moveable. 

I have an appointment in two weeks to see my doctor about it. But in the meantime, I'd like opinions. I'm kinda scared it could be lymphoma. I don't have any other symptoms, but I know some people have no symptoms at all and still find out they have cancer. So yeah. ",1,1768493009.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

1qdndjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ourtownreno/comments/1qdndjr/morgan_wadsworth_a_genzer_taking_on_the/,"Morgan Wadsworth, a Gen-Zer Taking on the Establishment to Help Northern Nevada Reach Its Full Potential","# Morgan Wadsworth, 26, recently announced her run to represent northern Nevada in the U.S. Congress with a modern western styled flyer and website titled “Battle Born. Ready to Fight.” 

“I’m a sixth generation Nevadan and so my family has been here for quite a while,” the North Valleys grad and first generation UNR student told Our Town Reno in a phone interview this week ahead of June  primary voting.  

“I grew up in a working class family and I've been working myself since I was 14,” she says not afraid of what lies ahead in terms of campaigning as a Democrat to be able to face off against Republican Mark Amodei, representing Nevada’s red leaning 2nd District since 2011.  Her first job was as a lifeguard at Wild Island in Sparks, while growing up with a single mom and SNAP benefits.  

She’s also been a waitress, bartender, veterinary assistant, dishwasher and janitor.  Wadsworth initially wanted to become a doctor but after a pandemic era break in her studies, she’s now switched to pre-law political science and legal studies.

Some of her advocacy, including for better health care, originates with the story of her grandfather who recently passed away, after a life of struggles stemming from being accidentally shot when he was a teenager during a hunting trip with friends in rural Lincoln County, in southern Nevada, where her family has a history of cattle ranching. 

“I had a cousin and my grandfather, they had to go to California a bunch of times to get medical care because they couldn't get it here in Nevada,” she says. “We have a huge shortage of specialists. We have a huge shortage of even non-specialists like family medicine doctors. We have a shortage of nurses. A lot of our rural communities still have problems accessing hospitals and emergency rooms.”

In terms of affordability, she’s also worried about rising rents and prevalent corporate home purchases in our Silver State.  

Environmental issues are another priority, including protecting water resources and public land.  

“A lot of people come into our state and they want to get these massive tax breaks and these massive sweetheart deals with the promise of jobs and you know, we've been burned by that before but we still for some reason keep doing it,” she says.  

Her run also comes from being “exhausted with a lot of our leadership in Nevada. I feel like a lot of them are inaccessible. A lot of them don't listen. They don't show up in our communities. They don't hold town halls... You have to listen to your constituents. You have to be accessible, you have to be available, you have to be accountable. You have to work for the people you're representing and not the wealthiest donors.”  

Her youth she says as an older Gen Z can be a strength, using her digital media abilities, while also showing up to events, from coffee shop crawls to mutual aid groups to meetings at libraries and appealing to younger voters who often feel disheartened by the whole political process.  

“I have the experience that matters the most, which is being a working class person in Nevada. Gen Z, we’re kind of getting the brunt of a lot of what's going on right now and we are severely under represented in federal government,” she said.  

Wadsworth thought of running as an independent but with all the signatures required for that, she says, and similar candidates then splitting each other’s votes in November she decided going through the Democratic primary makes the most sense.

“I put Nevada before I put political parties or donors first,” she concluded during our interview.  “Being born and raised here, these are the communities and the people that raised me, and that I've been around my entire life. This state matters a lot to me and I think that we have all the talent and all the resources to fix the issues that we're dealing with.  I think that we should be focusing on those issues instead of fighting each other and hating each other and all these things. Nevada is an amazing state and I want to see it reach its full potential.”

Regarding the news about Emerson Motors Company **(EMC)** hiring ***Black Innovation Kontrol Experts (BIKE)***, there are several interesting aspects worth noting:



**Why This News Matters:**

Technological Advancements: BIKE has been at the forefront of technological advancements in the region, which is significant for Detroit's automotive industry.

Local Talent Retention: The team behind BIKE chose to stay in Detroit despite opportunities elsewhere, demonstrating a commitment to local growth and development.

Transparency and Environmental Initiatives: EMC's hiring of BIKE signals an investment not just in engineering but also in improving the region's environmental standards through better rating systems.

**Benefits for EMC:**

Expertise in Technological Innovations: While the specific terms are undisclosed, the hiring suggests that EMC is investing in cutting-edge technology and innovation.

Enhanced Corporate Image: By partnering with a team known for their contributions to the community and technological advancements, EMC can enhance its reputation as an environmentally and socially conscious company.

**Implications for the Automotive Industry:**

Industry-wide Benefits: The technologies and practices developed by BIKE could benefit the broader automotive industry beyond just EMC.

Community Development: BIKE's work with small neighborhood jobs before forming the company suggests a commitment to community development, which is valuable for the long-term health of Detroit.

**Connection to the Court Case:**

Uncertainty Surrounding the Court Case: The hiring and court case are not directly connected as of now, but both involve significant environmental and technological aspects. If there's any link, it might become clearer with further developments.

Declined Comments: The non-comment from EMC, GCEPA, and BIKE suggests that the situation is still under investigation or negotiation.

**Conclusion:**

*The hiring of BIKE by EMC represents a strategic move towards innovation and environmental responsibility in Detroit. It aligns with broader trends toward sustainable development and local economic growth.* **As more information becomes available, we might gain clearer insights into how these initiatives will impact both EMC and the wider automotive industry.**",1,1768492754.0,u_Southern-Address-130,0,1.0,False

From baby being around 7 weeks old I started doing two local free classes. At each one I met a FTM with a similar aged baby and made friends. One of these I've got her number and we've met for coffee once.

In the new year I hit the baby classes hard and did one every day. Each time I've got chatting with 1 or 2 people around me but I've just felt like it's chit chat and not that fun. A few times I've felt like the second/third time mums aren't really looking for more friends as they made enough when they had their first.

At the same time I feel like the mum I befriended before Christmas isn't really putting in the same energy (texting/inviting me) so I've backed off as I don't want to be begging it.

They didn’t actually seem to have much of a bond or the friendship side of a relationship which was strange because they started off as friends (I actually think they had a pretty cute friendship).  There wasn’t really ever much of a time, that I recall, that they were just getting along, going on dates, sharing with each other, or living life together.

If we look at Alex’s other relationships, he did have that.  We saw him and Jo at the batting cages, at the loft, hanging out together, drinking together, in bed together (non-sexually), on a vacation/honeymoon, etc….  We saw him and Lexie drinking beers in the kitchen together.  We saw Alex lying in bed, admiring Lexie while she slept (a level of softness and love not really present with Izzie).  We saw him and Lucy share a common sports interest.  Even with Ava, we saw them lying in bed together, speaking about her husband and daughter (obviously it’s inappropriate that they were sleeping together while she was married).  Izzie’s relationship with Denny was obviously inappropriate and unethical, and she clearly didn’t know him super well, but we saw them playing Scrabble together, we saw her gossiping about her friends to him, and they spent some time actually talking to each other.  There was a low intensity comfort just being in each other’s presence.  I feel like we never saw that with Alex and Izzie.  They were either sleeping together, fighting about sex, fighting about other people, dealing with lashing out, dealing with miscommunication, getting hurt feelings, etc…. They never seemed like they could be just a “normal” couple talking over coffee in the morning, attending game night with friends, grabbing dinner together at night.  It just felt intense all the time.

Despite the fact that they ended up married for awhile, it didn’t seem like they actually knew each other well.  It didn’t seem like Izzie knew about Alex’s time in Foster Care or Juvenile Detention.  It didn’t seem like Alex knew what Izzie’s mom and childhood were like because he seemed surprised by her mom’s behavior when they met.  It didn’t seem like Alex knew about Izzie’s daughter.  What he did know of her past, he disapproved of- her modeling.  If someone were to ask what they liked about each other, it’d be hard to even imagine an answer.

Their divorce, on the show, came about when/how it did because Katherine Heigl left.  However, it’s hard to even imagine what the writers would have done if she hadn’t left when she did.  Alex and Izzie were married but also kind of strangers and resentful (The only time that it seemed like they knew each other well was when Alex told Jo about the life that he pictured for Izzie).  The relationship was intense but not comfortable or loving.  There was just no levity.  It felt like they were always overcoming one bump after another and never just enjoying each other’s company.  It’s hard to imagine that they would have had a path forward even if Katherine Heigl stayed on the show.",3,1768492224.0,greysanatomy,3,0.8,False

I do absolutely feel less hungry, but not ZERO appetite. Instead of snacking all day along with eating meals, I really just eat a meal and that’s it. I can easily cut myself off at 6pm and have no desire for more food or snacking. So all in all just decreaed appetite, but no other negative effects.

Took 2nd injection last evening, again zero negative side effects so far, just decreased appetite, had a bagel (whole grain with hummus) for breakfast and I could probably go a while before eating again.

A couple things I’ve noticed though:

\- I had two glasses of wine last week (on seperate days/ 1 glass) and didn’t even feel remotely buzzed or anything, which is kind of sad, which ultimately I just haven’t drank at all since the “fun” part isn’t really there. I’m not a huge drinker anyway but enjoy a social buzz when out.

\- I also don’t feel the effects from my caffeine in my coffee as much. I drink black coffee and usually feel that little perk after, but nothing now.

\- I have been feeling much less bloated.

Questions:

Does this medication “build up” in your system? That’s what I have read through research, but I feel like the day before the shot I am a little hungrier that day..so does it wear off?

I have lost 4lbs since my first shot, but I’m not really counting it because I feel like it’s just water weight?

Can anyone tell me their journey and upping their dose etc? I’m only on week two but I’d love to hear others detailed journey on their microdose program!

hey folks, figured i'd share a quick rundown for anyone driving to the lod winterfest show at the pony on 01/18. parking in asbury park can be a pain, even in january, because the areas near the waterfront are still pretty active. 12:00 pm on a saturday means the meters will definitely be live.  
  
first up, a solid pro move is checking out prked. honestly, skip the traffic and the hunt. prked is an app where locals rent out their driveways or empty garage spots, often right around the corner from the stone pony. it's usually way cheaper than the event lots, you get to skip the lines trying to get into a structure, and you're maybe a 5-minute walk from the venue. just book it ahead of time and you're set.  
  
if you prefer the traditional route, you've got a couple of options.  
  
the easiest but most expensive are the official paid lots managed by laz parking, which are located on fourth, second, and lake avenues. the stone pony website even has a link to pre-reserve a spot with their partner, which i'd recommend if you absolutely want a guaranteed space without the hassle. a little pricy, but zero stress.  
  
next is street parking, which is all year-round and can be cheaper. you'll need the asbury park parking app (or parkmobile). the meters run from 9 am all the way to 2 am, so you'll definitely need to pay for the day. look along ocean avenue or the avenues immediately off the boardwalk (first, second, third, etc.). you just pay with your license plate number, no receipt display needed.  
  
now for the insider tip: free parking. if you're willing to walk a little, you have two options. one, and this is the classic move, park over in \*\*ocean grove\*\* near the boardwalk and walk the 5-10 minutes north into asbury park. it's generally free on the street there, but be mindful of any new local permit signs. the other free spot is to drive \*west of grand avenue\* and \*north of bangs avenue\* in downtown asbury park. it's a slightly longer walk, maybe 15-20 minutes, but it's a solid, free backup if the ocean grove spots are taken.  
  
my best advice is to get there early-ish, like around 11:00 am. you'll catch the least amount of traffic, snag a better street spot before the crowd hits, and you have time to grab a coffee or hit the boardwalk before the doors open for the 12:00 pm start.  
  
hope this helps and you have a sick time at winterfest.",1,1768492032.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

I've since moved jobs and while there are many improvements, I haven't found the same level of friendships, and the job can be quite isolating. It would be lovely to make a few, even virtually.

Friendships are really important in both good times and bad times, and I would be grateful for the opportunity to be able to support one another. Truth be told that last year was quite difficult for me, but I think that is all the more reason to pursue more meaningful friendships.

The most important thing to me in the conversations would be honesty and consistency. It would be great to receive that, and I would be happy to do the same.

* Practical applications for real-world data analysis

**Understanding the Essence of Machine Learning**

**The Key Takeaway: Machine Learning as a Data Analyst's Ally**

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems capable of learning from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. For data analysts, it serves as a powerful ally, enabling them to uncover patterns and insights that are not immediately apparent.

**What Makes Machine Learning Essential?**

Machine learning algorithms can process vast amounts of data swiftly, identify trends, and offer predictive insights that manual analysis might overlook. This capability is invaluable in today's fast-paced business environments where real-time decision-making is critical. By incorporating machine learning techniques, data analysts can enhance the precision and depth of their analyses, driving more informed business strategies.

**A Glimpse at Real-World Impact**

Consider a retail company that uses machine learning to analyze customer purchase behaviors. By understanding patterns and predicting future buying trends, the company can tailor marketing strategies, optimize inventory, and ultimately improve customer satisfaction and revenue. This is just one example of how machine learning can add tangible value to data analysis efforts.

**Types of Machine Learning**

**The Key Takeaway: Different Types for Different Needs**

Machine learning can be broadly categorized into three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Each type serves distinct purposes and is suited to different kinds of problems.

**Supervised Learning**

Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, which means that the input data is paired with the correct output. The model learns to map inputs to the desired output and can then make predictions on new, unseen data. Common applications include regression and classification tasks.

* **Regression Example:** Predicting housing prices based on features like square footage, location, and number of bedrooms.
* **Classification Example:** Identifying whether an email is spam or not based on its content.

**Unsupervised Learning**

Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The goal is to identify underlying patterns or groupings within the data. Clustering and association are typical tasks in this category.

* **Clustering Example:** Segmenting customers into different groups based on purchasing behavior.
* **Association Example:** Market basket analysis to determine items frequently bought together.

**Reinforcement Learning**

Reinforcement learning involves training models to make sequences of decisions by rewarding desired behaviors and penalizing undesirable ones. It’s often used in environments where the model must make a series of decisions to reach a goal.

* **Example:** Training an AI to play a game, where it learns strategies to maximize its score.

**Beginner-Friendly Machine Learning Techniques**

**The Key Takeaway: Starting Simple with Practical Techniques**

For those new to machine learning, beginning with simpler techniques can provide a solid foundation before tackling more complex algorithms. Here, we'll introduce two approachable methods: Linear Regression and K-Means Clustering.

**Linear Regression: A Step into Predictive Modeling**

Linear Regression is one of the simplest forms of machine learning, used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

    # Import necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    
    # Load dataset
    data = pd.read_csv('house_prices.csv')
    X = data[['square_footage', 'num_bedrooms']]
    y = data['price']
    
    # Create a linear regression model
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X, y)
    
    # Predict house price
    predicted_price = model.predict([[1500, 3]])
    print(f'Predicted Price: ${predicted_price[0]:,.2f}')

In this example, we're predicting house prices based on square footage and the number of bedrooms. This method provides a clear introduction to predictive modeling, illustrating how relationships between variables can be quantified and used for predictions.

**K-Means Clustering: Uncovering Patterns**

K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that partitions data into K distinct clusters based on feature similarity.

    # Import necessary libraries
    from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    # Sample data
    X = [[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 0],
         [4, 2], [4, 4], [4, 0]]
    
    # Define KMeans model
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=0).fit(X)
    
    # Cluster centers and labels
    print(""Cluster Centers:"", kmeans.cluster_centers_)
    print(""Labels:"", kmeans.labels_)
    
    # Visualize clusters
    plt.scatter(*zip(*X), c=kmeans.labels_)
    plt.scatter(*zip(*kmeans.cluster_centers_), marker='x', color='red')
    plt.title('K-Means Clustering')
    plt.show()

This technique helps in discovering hidden structures in data, such as grouping similar customers for targeted marketing strategies.

In subsequent sections, we will delve deeper into more advanced techniques, common pitfalls to avoid, and how to effectively implement machine learning in your data analysis projects. Stay tuned for more insights and practical advice on leveraging machine learning to enhance your analytical capabilities.

**Building the Foundation: Key Concepts in Machine Learning**

Understanding the foundational concepts of machine learning is essential for any data analyst aiming to leverage these powerful tools effectively. Machine learning, at its core, is about creating models that can learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions based on that learning. Let's delve into some key concepts that form the backbone of machine learning.

**Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning**

Machine learning models are generally categorized into two primary types: supervised and unsupervised learning. The choice between them depends on the nature of the data and the problem you're trying to solve.

**Supervised Learning** involves training a model on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label. The model learns to map inputs to outputs, making it ideal for tasks like classification and regression.

**Example in Python:**

    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    import pandas as pd
    
    # Load a dataset
    data = pd.read_csv('housing_prices.csv')
    X = data[['square_feet', 'num_rooms', 'age_of_home']]
    y = data['price']
    
    # Split the data
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    
    # Train a linear regression model
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Make predictions
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)

**Unsupervised Learning**, on the other hand, does not use labeled data. The model tries to learn the underlying structure from the input data, making it suitable for tasks like clustering and dimensionality reduction.

**Example in Python:**

    from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
    import pandas as pd
    
    # Load a dataset
    data = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv')
    X = data[['age', 'income', 'spending_score']]
    
    # Apply K-means clustering
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
    kmeans.fit(X)
    
    # Assign cluster labels
    data['cluster'] = kmeans.labels_

**Overfitting and Underfitting**

A crucial aspect of building machine learning models is balancing between overfitting and underfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns not only the underlying patterns but also the noise in the training data, leading to poor generalization on unseen data. Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture the underlying trend of the data.

**Example of Overfitting:**

Consider a polynomial regression model that fits a high-degree polynomial to a dataset. If the degree is too high, the model may fit the training data very closely but fail to generalize:

    from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
    
    # Create a polynomial regression model
    degree = 10
    model = make_pipeline(PolynomialFeatures(degree), LinearRegression())
    
    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Evaluate the model
    train_score = model.score(X_train, y_train)
    test_score = model.score(X_test, y_test)

**Feature Engineering and Selection**

Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance. Effective feature engineering requires domain knowledge and creativity. Feature selection, on the other hand, involves selecting the most relevant features that contribute significantly to the model's output, reducing dimensionality and improving efficiency.

**Example of Feature Selection:**

    from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_regression
    
    # Select top k features
    selector = SelectKBest(score_func=f_regression, k=2)
    X_new = selector.fit_transform(X, y)
    
    # Get selected feature names
    selected_features = X.columns[selector.get_support()]

**Diving Deeper: Advanced Techniques in Machine Learning**

Once the basics are in place, data analysts can explore more advanced techniques to unlock deeper insights and drive more impactful results.

**Ensemble Methods**

Ensemble methods, such as bagging and boosting, combine multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than any of the constituent learning algorithms alone. Random forests and gradient boosting machines are popular ensemble techniques.

**Example of Random Forest:**

    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    
    # Train a random forest classifier
    rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Make predictions
    predictions = rf_model.predict(X_test)

**Dimensionality Reduction**

When dealing with high-dimensional data, dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) help reduce...

hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking tips for the buckethead show at music box on sunday, 01/17, since parking in little italy is honestly a total headache even on a sunday evening with all the dinner crowd. planning ahead is key to not missing the 9:00 pm start time.  
  
first thing i gotta tell you about is Prked. i've found this to be the absolute easiest way to park for any music box event. it's an app where people who live right next to the venue will rent out their private driveways or garages just for the night. it's usually way cheaper than the public lots and you get a guaranteed, prepaid spot just a super short walk away, like a minute or two from the door. using Prked lets you completely skip all the chaos of circling the blocks for street parking.  
  
if you don't use Prked, you're in luck because the event is on a sunday. this is the main pro tip for music box: street parking in the little italy area is free all day sunday. you don't have to worry about meters at all, and no waiting for the usual 6:00 pm free cutoff time. however, because it's free and everyone knows it, those spots will be taken up super fast, especially because of the dinner rush before the show. if you really want one of the free spots, you need to get there \*early\*, honestly aim for well before 6:30 pm, and be patient cruising india street, kettner, and the perpendicular side streets. even though it's free, you still have to check all signs carefully for tow-away zones and residential permit-only spots, which are definitely enforced.  
  
if the free spots are all gone or you don't want the hassle, there are a ton of paid parking lots and garages around, literally seven within a block or two. the closest lots are right there on india street (like the 1304 india st. lot) and on kettner boulevard (the 1329 kettner blvd lot, formerly the ryan lot). expect to pay anywhere from $10 to $20 for the night. for a slightly cheaper, insider option, try the larger downtown parking structures which are a short walk away. the garage at 610 w. ash street is a solid find because it offers parking for only $5 a vehicle after 5:00 pm. the one america plaza garage is another cheap garage option and is only about a 4-minute walk away. the carte hotel also has valet parking which is super close, less than a tenth of a mile away.  
  
you can also use apps like spothero or parkwhiz to reserve a space in one of these paid lots or structures in advance. this is great for peace of mind, just know it might be a little more expensive than showing up and paying at the gate.  
  
bottom line: plan to arrive early no matter what you choose-aim for 7:00 pm to 8:00 pm for the 9:00 pm show if you are going for a free street spot-so you're not rushing and can grab a coffee or a bite before buckethead hits the stage. hope this helps and have a great time!",1,1768491784.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

Because honestly? Most dads around me (including my own) seemed to just wing it and hope for the best. society tells us to provide financially and show up to soccer games, but nobody teaches us how to actually *be* a good father. like the kind your kids remember fondly 30 years later instead of unpacking in therapy.

The uncomfortable truth is that many of us are operating on outdated blueprints passed down from generations who thought emotional unavailability was somehow masculine. We're not broken, we're just working with faulty instructions. But here's the thing, you can completely rewire how you show up as a dad with some practical tools and a willingness to challenge what you think fatherhood should look like.

**The presence game is everything.** Research from Harvard's Center on the Developing Child shows that responsive relationships in early childhood literally shape brain architecture. your kid doesn't need you to be perfect or buy them everything. they need you *there*. emotionally available, not just physically present while scrolling through your phone. Dr. Becky Kennedy talks about this constantly on her Good Inside podcast and it was different for me. She breaks down how kids need us to see their feelings as real and valid, even when they're losing their minds over the ""wrong"" color cup. When you validate emotions instead of dismissing them (stop saying ""you're fine"" when they're clearly not), you build trust that lasts forever.

Put your phone in another room during dinner. actually listen when they ramble about minecraft lore. get on the floor and play even when you're exhausted. These moments compound over time into a relationship where your kid actually wants to talk to you during the teen years.

**Repair is more important than perfection.** You're gonna mess up. You'll lose your temper, you'll say something harsh, you'll prioritize work over school play. The Gift of Failure by Jessica Lahey completely changed how I think about mistakes. Lahey is an educator and parent who's written for The Atlantic, and this bestseller shows how our attempts to protect kids from failure actually damage them long term. She argues that kids need to see us fail and recover because that's how they learn resilience.

when you screw up (and you will), model accountability. say ""I shouldn't have yelled, I was frustrated and handled that badly, I'm sorry"" without adding ""but you were being difficult."" full stop apology. Dr. Dan Siegel's research on attachment shows that rupture and repair cycles actually strengthen bonds when done right. your kid learns that relationships can survive conflict and that mistakes don't define you.

**Emotion coaching over emotion dismissing.** Most of us were raised by parents who couldn't handle big feelings, so they shut ours down. ""boys don't cry"" type garbage. John Gottman's research (he literally predicted divorce rates with scary accuracy) found that parents fall into four categories, and only one produces emotionally intelligent kids. He calls it emotion coaching. you acknowledge feelings, help kids label them, set limits on behavior while validating the emotion, and problem solve together.

The Whole Brain Child by Daniel Siegel and Tina Payne Bryson breaks this down in stupid simple terms. Both are clinical professors and this book is basically a neuroscience guide to parenting without the academic headache. They explain why your toddler has a meltdown over nothing (their upstairs brain literally isn't developed yet) and give you actual scripts for responding. insanely good read if you want to stop reacting and start responding intentionally.

**Show up for the mundane stuff.** The research is clear. Kids remember the regular Tuesday nights more than the expensive vacation. Dr. Lisa Damour talks about this on her podcast Ask Lisa and in her books like Untangled. She's a psychologist who works with teens and families, and she emphasizes that teens especially need us during the boring, everyday moments because that's when they actually open up. not during the forced ""let's have a talk about feelings"" conversations.

do the bedtime routine even when you're tired. Make breakfast on weekends. drive them to practice. These repetitive acts build security. your kid internalizes ""my dad shows up"" which becomes the foundation of their self worth.

**Model the behavior you want to see.** Kids are basically tiny mirrors. They watch everything. If you want them to read, they need to see you reading. If you want them to handle frustration well, they need to watch you take deep breaths instead of punching walls when your team loses. if you want them to have healthy relationships, they need to see you treat their mother (or co parent) with respect even during disagreements.

The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read by Philippa Perry is phenomenal here. Perry is a psychotherapist who's been on tons of UK media, and this book will make you question everything you think you know about parenting. She talks about how we unconsciously repeat patterns from our own childhood unless we actively examine them. It's uncomfortable but necessary work.

If you're serious about breaking generational patterns and becoming the father you wish you had, there's an AI-powered learning app called Be Freed that pulls from parenting psychology research, expert interviews, and books like the ones mentioned here. You tell it your specific goal, like ""become more emotionally available as a dad"" or ""stop repeating my father's mistakes,"" and it creates a personalized audio learning plan built around your unique struggles and parenting style.


**Create one on one time with each kid.** If you have multiple children, they need individual attention. doesn't have to be elaborate. Grab coffee with your teen before school. Let your eight year old pick the activity every Saturday morning. Dr. Shefali Tsabary's work on conscious parenting emphasizes that kids need to feel seen as individuals, not just as part of the family unit.

These moments let them know they matter beyond their role as sibling or student or athlete. you get to know who they actually are instead of who you assume they are.

**Be a safe place for hard conversations.** teens especially need at least one adult they can tell anything to without judgment or freakout. if your kid experiments with alcohol, gets their heart broken, struggles with identity stuff, you want to be the person they come to. not because you're permissive, but because they trust you won't shame them or make it worse.

respond with curiosity instead of anger. ""Tell me more about that"" goes further than ""how could you be so stupid."" Your job isn't to prevent all mistakes, it's to be there when they happen so your kid learns to navigate hard things with support.

**Prioritize your own mental health.** you can't pour from an empty cup and all that. but seriously, untreated anxiety or depression or anger issues will leak into your parenting no matter how hard you try to compartmentalize. The Mindful Dad podcast by Brian and Carlee actually makes meditation and mindfulness accessible for regular dudes. they don't do the woo woo stuff, just practical ways to regulate your nervous system so you're not constantly in fight or flight mode with your kids.

therapy isn't weakness. Neither is using an app like Ash for mental health support when you need to process stuff. Taking care of yourself is taking care of your kids.

**Question traditional masculinity.** a lot of what we think makes us ""strong"" actually makes us unavailable. emotional suppression, refusing to ask for help, prioritizing work over presence, avoiding vulnerability. Your kids need you to be soft and strong. They need to see you cry at movies, admit when you're wrong, ask their mom for help, and express affection.

The Mask of Masculinity by Lewis Howes digs into this. Howes is a former athlete turned entrepreneur who interviews high performers, and this book examines how traditional masculine masks damage men and everyone around them. It's not about becoming less masculine, it's about expanding what masculinity can include.

Being a disgustingly good father means doing the uncomfortable work of unlearning harmful patterns, showing up consistently for the boring stuff, and choosing connection over convenience every single day. Your kids won't remember if you had the biggest house or newest car. They'll remember if you made them feel loved, safe, and worthy exactly as they are.

It has been dropped, rolled around in backpacks, taken on road trips, camping, work, you name it. The paint is scratched up and it looks kinda rough but the thing still seals like the day I bought it.

I tested it recently just out of curiosity. Filled it with hot coffee in the morning and it was still warm way later than expected. No leaks at all either, even when I toss it sideways in a bag. The lid threads still feel solid and the gasket somehow has not dried out or cracked.

I have bought newer bottles over the years with fancy features that did not last half as long. This one just keeps doing its job without complaining. Makes me appreciate older simple stuff that was built to last instead of trying to be trendy.

Anyone else still using their first thermos or bottle? Curious what brands have held up for you over the years.",1,1768491672.0,ProductQuery,0,1.0,False
1qdmuav,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1qdmuav/delivery_driver/,Delivery Driver,"There is a certain kind of quiet you only hear in the desert.

It is not the peaceful kind people post about, not the wide-open silence that makes you feel small in a romantic way. It is the kind of quiet that feels like the world has stepped back a few feet and is watching you. Like the empty space around your house has weight.

My parents’ place sits on the edge of Las Vegas, where the neighborhoods thin out and the streetlights start to feel too far apart. In the day, everything looks sun-bleached and normal. Stucco homes. Gravel yards with neat little succulents. A few palm trees that look like they’re fighting the climate. The horizon is always too clear, the sky always too big.

At night, though, the desert makes the dark feel more intentional.

That weekend, it was supposed to be perfect.

We’d been looking forward to it for weeks, the three of us texting in our group chat like it was a countdown to something sacred. Carmen Lopez had brought two duffel bags, one full of clothes and one full of snacks, because she said she didn’t trust anyone else to pack correctly. Shay Smith had a portable speaker and a stack of horror movies she insisted were “classic,” even though I’d never heard of half of them. And me, Alyssa Short, I had the house.

A whole house.

Just for us.

My parents called it an “Adult Weekend” with that specific tone adults use when they want you to know they’re still cool. My mom had actually said the word casinos like she was saying it for my benefit, like I was supposed to picture them dressed up and happy and out late. They were going with Carmen’s parents and Shay’s parents too. Three couples. A weekend getaway. Dinner reservations. Shows. Slot machines. They made it sound like a group field trip.

They kept telling us all the same thing.

“Don’t open the door for anyone.”

“Don’t leave the backyard gate unlatched.”

“Keep your phones on.”

“Order food, but don’t tell anyone you’re alone.”

My dad said that last one like it was a joke. Like it was a funny little modern rule.

But he said it twice.

By the time their cars pulled away Friday afternoon, the three of us were already on the living room floor with blankets and nail polish and the kind of laughter that makes your stomach hurt.

It felt like freedom in the most teenage way possible. Not dramatic. Not rebellious. Just finally, for once, not being watched.

We made TikToks we never posted. We did face masks that made us look like aliens. Carmen tried to teach Shay and me a dance she swore was easy, and we all almost fell into the coffee table.

Then it was night, and the air-conditioning made the house feel too cold, and the windows turned into black mirrors reflecting our faces back at us.

Shay wanted to watch something scary, because of course she did. She said horror movies were “comforting,” which was the craziest thing I’d ever heard. Carmen argued for a rom-com. I said we could do both, because I didn’t want to fight on our weekend.

We ended up with Shay’s choice first.

The movie was the kind that used silence like a weapon. Long shots of empty hallways. A soundtrack that sounded like distant breathing. The kind of film where every creak in the house feels like it could be part of the story.

Halfway through, Carmen got up and started rummaging in my kitchen cabinets like she owned the place.

“We need pizza,” she announced.

“Obviously,” I said.

My family has a tradition. It sounds silly when I say it out loud, but it’s real. Every weekend, at least once, we get Papa John’s. It started when I was little and my dad was working late all the time. Friday nights were pizza nights, no matter what. It didn’t matter if we were broke. It didn’t matter if we were busy. Papa John’s meant the week was done. It meant we were all in the same room.

So when Carmen said pizza, my brain didn’t even process the possibility of something else. Pizza was normal. Pizza was safe. Pizza was home.

Shay made a face. “I thought Italians hated chain pizza.”

“I’m Italian,” I said, pointing at myself like it was evidence. “And I love it. It’s a family tradition.”

Carmen grinned. “See? Cultural significance.”

We checked the fridge. Nothing that wasn’t a condiment or something my mom would use in a salad. Carmen waved her phone around like she was searching for signal even though the Wi-Fi was fine.

“My mom said they might order us food,” she said. “Like surprise us.”

“My dad said the same,” Shay added.

That settled it in our minds. The idea became a fact. Parents out at casinos, feeling generous, sending pizza to their daughters like a sitcom.

We went back to the living room and waited, half-watching the movie, half-watching our phones, the way you do when you’re expecting something you really want.

At some point, I must have gotten too comfortable. I remember the blankets around my legs, the glow of the TV, Shay’s braids falling forward as she leaned toward the screen. Carmen’s laugh was soft as she whispered a comment about how the main character was making dumb choices.

Then, the knock.

It didn’t sound like it belonged in the movie.

It came from the front door, sharp and real, and it cut through the room in a way that made all three of us freeze.

We looked at each other.

“Pizza,” Carmen mouthed, like she was afraid to say it too loudly.

Shay lowered the volume. The TV became a muted flicker.

Another knock came, a little impatient this time.

We all moved at once, the three of us sliding off the couch like we’d rehearsed it. The living room opened into the entryway, and beyond that was the front door, painted a pale tan that blended into the stucco outside. There was a peephole. There were two locks. There was a small Ring camera my dad had installed after our neighbor’s car got broken into.

We didn’t think about any of that.

We thought about pizza.

Carmen leaned in and peered through the peephole.

“Yep,” she whispered. “Delivery guy.”

Shay pushed closer. “Is he holding it?”

“Yeah. Box bag thing.”

My stomach actually fluttered with happiness. It’s embarrassing how much joy a pizza can bring when you’re sixteen and the night feels wide open.

I stepped up and slid the inside light on, because I wanted whoever it was to know we were there, to know we were coming. Then I unlocked the top lock.

Carmen’s hand touched my arm. “Wait, should we ask who ordered it?”

“It’s fine,” I said, because I genuinely believed that. “It’s Papa John’s. It’s probably my parents.”

Shay was already smiling. “If your parents got garlic knots, I’ll forgive them for leaving us.”

I opened the door.

At first, it was exactly what we expected.

A man in a delivery uniform stood on the porch. He had a cap pulled low and a thermal bag in his left hand. The porch light made his face look pale and washed out. He wasn’t old, maybe late twenties or early thirties, but there was something about his stillness that made him seem older. He wasn’t shifting his weight like people usually do. He wasn’t smiling. His eyes flicked past me, past the doorway, into the house like he was counting shapes.

“Evening,” I said, bright and automatic.

He didn’t respond to that. Instead, he tilted his head slightly and asked, in a tone that was wrong in a way I can’t fully explain, “Are you three girls alone in here?”

It was the exact moment the air changed.

The question wasn’t normal. It wasn’t part of any delivery script. It didn’t match the pizza in his hand.

Behind me, Shay went very still. Carmen’s fingers tightened on my arm.

I should have lied.

I know that now. I know it in the way you know you should have grabbed the handrail before you fell. But in the moment, my brain was still running on the assumption that everything made sense.

And Carmen, on instinct, because Carmen always answered things quickly, said, “Yeah. Our parents are at the casino for the weekend.”

The delivery driver’s expression changed immediately.

It wasn’t dramatic. He didn’t grin or laugh. It was subtler than that, which made it worse. His eyes sharpened, like something had clicked into place.

Then he moved.

Fast.

Before I could even step back, he shoved the thermal bag into my chest hard enough to knock the air out of me. My feet slid on the tile. The edge of the door slammed against the wall. He came in with the momentum of someone who’d already decided.

Carmen screamed.

Shay’s hands flew up.

I tried to push him back out, but he was already inside the threshold, already in our space. His shoulder hit mine. His breath smelled like cigarettes and something sour.

“Back,” he said, and it wasn’t loud, but it was sharp. Commanding. “Back up.”

His right hand came out from behind his body holding a knife.

Not a little pocket knife. Not a tool. A kitchen knife with a long blade that caught the porch light and turned it into a thin, bright line.

My entire body locked.

It felt unreal. Like a prop. Like something from the movie still playing silently in my living room.

But Shay made a sound, a low choked noise that told me she understood exactly how real it was.

“Please,” Carmen said immediately, her voice shaking. “Please, take whatever you want. Just, just leave.”

He didn’t look at Carmen.

He looked at me.

Maybe because I was closest. Maybe because it was my house. Maybe because I was standing there with a pizza bag pressed to my chest like I’d been handed a bomb.

“Inside,” he said. “All of you. Move.”

Shay’s eyes met mine. I saw the same thought in them, the same desperate attempt to find an exit, a weapon, an adult, a miracle.

But the house was suddenly a trap. The door behind him. The windows that were too high. The silence outside.

We moved, because the knife made our bodies obey.

He herded us through the entryway into the living room, pushing the door closed with his foot behind him. The click of it shutting sounded too final, like a lock clicking in a prison.

The movie on the TV kept flashing. A character’s face frozen mid-scream in a silent world.

The delivery driver, because I still thought of him that way even as everything shattered, pointed the knife toward the hallway.

“Bedroom,” he said.

Carmen shook her head, crying. “Please, please don’t.”

“Bedroom,” he repeated, louder. “Now.”

We went down the hallway like it was a tunnel narrowing around us. My heart was pounding so hard it made my vision pulse. I could hear Shay breathing in short, sharp bursts. Carmen was sobbing openly, her hands held up as if that could shield her.

The man followed close, the knife angled forward, and I realized, with a cold, horrifying clarity, that he wasn’t improvising. He wasn’t uncertain. He knew where he wanted us.

He pushed us into my parents’ guest bedroom, the one with the beige comforter and the framed desert print on the wall. The room smelled faintly like laundry detergent and unused space.

“On the floor,” he said.

We got down.

The carpet pressed into my knees. The air felt too thick.

He reached into his hoodie and pulled out zip ties.

My stomach dropped again. This wasn’t random.

This wasn’t a guy who snapped at the door.

He had come prepared.

He tied our wrists, tight enough to hurt but not tight enough to cut off circulation, and he did it with a grim efficiency that made my skin crawl. Shay struggled, once, instinctively jerking away, and he raised the knife close to her face in a warning that made her freeze.

“Stop,” he hissed.

He tied our ankles too, then backed toward the door, still holding the knife, eyes darting from face to face like he was watching for movement.

“You scream,” he said, voice low, “and I come back in.”

Then he stepped out and shut the door.

We heard the lock click.

For a second, none of us moved. Not because we didn’t want to. Because our brains couldn’t accept the fact that we were locked inside a bedroom in my own house, tied up, while a stranger with a knife walked freely in the rest of our lives.

Carmen was the first to break. She started shaking violently, tears sliding down her face into the carpet.

Shay leaned toward her as far as she could with her wrists bound. “Carmen. Carmen, look at me. We have to stay quiet.”

Her voice was steady in that way that didn’t match what was happening. It made me want to cry harder. Shay was always the calm one, the one who could talk to teachers without panicking, the one who could stop a fight just by looking at someone.

But this was bigger than us.

I tried to move my wrists. The zip ties bit into my skin. The pain helped keep me grounded.

“What do we do?” I whispered.

Shay’s eyes were wide, shining. “We wait. We listen. We don’t make noise.”

Carmen shook her head, whispering frantically. “He asked if we were alone. He asked. That’s not normal. That’s not, that’s not—”

“I know,” Shay said.

The house beyond the door creaked.

We heard footsteps. Slow. Wandering. Like he was exploring.

Then a drawer opening. A cabinet door. Something clinking.

He was going through our kitchen. Our living room. Our things.

The worst part was the uncertainty. The not knowing where he was. What he was doing. Whether he was bored, whether he was angry, whether he was planning something.

Time stretched. My legs went numb. My hands ached. Carmen’s breathing came in little squeaky bursts as she tried not to sob too loud.

Then we heard him talking.

At first, I thought he was on the phone. But the voice was too close. Too loud.

He was talking to himself.

Words drifting down the hallway, not coherent, fragments and muttering like a radio between stations. It made my scalp prickle. It made the situation feel less like a robbery and more like something unpredictable, something that could change shape without warning.

“Stupid,” he muttered at one point. “Stupid girls. Stupid.”

Carmen squeezed her eyes shut. Shay stared at the door like she could force it to open with her mind.

I kept thinking about the Ring camera, about how my dad would see him. Then I remembered the angle. The porch. The front door. It wouldn’t see him inside. It would see the moment we opened the door, then nothing.

And we’d opened it.

We’d invited the dark in like it was carrying dinner.

I don’t know how long we were in that room. Maybe twenty minutes. Maybe an hour. It felt like a night compressed into a tight space.

Then my phone buzzed.

The sound was tiny, almost nothing, but it was loud in a room where we were all holding our breath.

It was in my pocket.

My heart lurched. I couldn’t reach it with my hands tied.

It buzzed again. And again.

Carmen’s eyes snapped to me, panicked. Shay leaned in, whispering, “Don’t move. Don’t make it worse.”

The buzzing stopped.

A few minutes later, it started again.

This time, longer. Persistent.

My mom’s voice echoed in my head, Keep your phone on.

Dad’s voice, Don’t open the door.

I imagined my parents in a casino, lights flashing, noise everywhere, my mom checking her phone with a little smile like she was being responsible, like she was going to ask how our weekend was going.

I couldn’t answer.

The buzzing stopped.

Then, later, it buzzed again, three times, each one like a pulse.

The third call felt different. It lasted longer. It was insistent. And then it stopped abruptly, as if someone had made a decision.

Outside the bedroom, footsteps moved fast.

The man’s voice rose, angry now, yelling at no one, words slamming into the walls. Then the house went quiet, suddenly, as if he’d realized something.

I stared at the door.

Shay’s voice was barely audible. “My mom would call if I didn’t answer.”

Carmen whispered, “My dad too.”

And then, like a confirmation of our fear, the sound of a phone rang somewhere in the house.

Not mine. Not in the bedroom.

The intruder answered it.

We couldn’t hear the words clearly, but we heard the rhythm. Someone trying to sound normal. Someone trying to imitate.

“Hello?” he said, too cheerful, too quick. Then he paused. “Yeah. Yeah, we’re fine.”

My blood went cold.

He was pretending.

He was pretending to be my dad.

Because the voice was lower now, forced, and he was speaking like an adult on the phone, not like a pizza driver.

I heard my father in my mind, calm and careful, and I heard this stranger trying to wear that voice like a mask.

Then there was silence. Then the man laughed, a short, sharp sound, and hung up.

We sat there, tied up, listening to the house, and the terror shifted shape. It wasn’t just the knife anymore. It was the understanding that he was willing to interact with the world outside, that he could mislead people, that he could buy time.

Then, distant, faint, almost impossible to hear through walls and fear, came a sound that made my eyes fill with tears.

Sirens.

Not the movie. Not the soundtrack.

Real.

Approaching.

Shay closed her eyes and exhaled, one long breath like she’d been holding it for hours. Carmen let out a sound that was half sob, half prayer.

The sirens grew louder, then cut off abruptly, as if the police car had stopped just outside.

The house went still.

Footsteps moved again, quick and purposeful, toward the front door.

We heard the chain slide. The lock. The door opening.

Then a voice.

A man’s voice. Firm. Controlled.

“Sir,” he said, and it echoed faintly down the hallway. “We received a call from this residence. Can you step outside for me?”

The intruder’s voice changed again, deepening, smoothing, trying to become my father.

“There’s no problem,” he said. “I’m the homeowner. Everything’s fine.”

The officer didn’t sound convinced.

“Okay,” the officer said slowly. “Can I see your ID, sir?”

A pause.

A long pause where the house seemed to hold its breath with us.

“I, uh,” the intruder said, and for the first time he sounded unsure. “It’s inside.”

“Then let’s get it,” the officer said, still calm, still firm.

Another pause.

Then, sharper, “I don’t need to show you anything. I told you, I’m the homeowner.”

The officer’s voice hardened slightly. “Sir, the caller is still on the line with dispatch. They are saying you are not the homeowner.”

My stomach flipped.

Dispatch. My dad. The call. He’d called 911.

And the officer knew.

The intruder’s voice turned brittle. “This is ridiculous.”

The officer said, “I’m going to ask you one more time. Show me your ID.”

We heard a shuffle, like someone moving on the porch. Then another voice, a second officer, quieter, saying something we couldn’t make out.

Then the first officer spoke again, louder. “Sir, step back. Keep your hands where I can see them.”

My heartbeat pounded in my ears.

In the bedroom, Shay shifted, trying to rub her wrists against the carpet. Carmen stared at me like her eyes could ask a question she didn’t have words for.

Then we heard it.

A sudden thud, like a body hitting the door frame.

A scuffle. A curse.

The officer shouted something, and then the sound of the front door slammed.

Footsteps pounded inside the house, not wandering now, but running.

The intruder was moving deeper in, away from the porch, away from the police.

Toward us.

Shay’s eyes went wide, her face draining of color.

Carmen began to whimper.

I tried to scoot backward, dragging my bound legs uselessly, until my shoulder hit the bed frame. The wood felt solid and cruel behind me.

The doorknob rattled.

Once.

Twice.

Then the lock clicked, and the door opened a fraction before stopping, caught by something, maybe the officer pushing from the other side, maybe the intruder trying to force it.

A voice filled the hallway, close now, commanding.

“Police,” the officer shouted. “Step away from the door. Step away now.”

The door jerked, then slammed shut again.

Silence.

Then the officer’s footsteps moved fast down the hall, closer, and a key turned in the lock.

The door flew open.

An officer stood there, gun raised, eyes scanning the room, his face taut with concentration and adrenaline. Behind him, another officer, slightly farther back, covering the hallway.

For a second, they looked at us like they couldn’t process the sight. Three girls on the floor, wrists bound, ankles bound, faces streaked with tears.

Then the first officer swore under his breath and rushed in.

“It’s okay,” he said, voice softer now, urgent. “You’re okay. We’ve got you.”

He knelt and began cutting the zip ties with something small and sharp. The plastic snapped. Blood rushed back into my hands in hot, painful tingles.

Shay’s breath came out in a sob she’d been holding in the whole time. Carmen started crying so hard she shook.

“Where is he?” the officer asked, scanning the room again as he freed us. “Did he come in here? Did he leave?”

I tried to speak, but my throat felt sealed.

The officer’s radio crackled. Voices layered over each other, urgent updates about the front of the house, about the backyard, about a suspect moving through side yards, about a vehicle.

A vehicle.

The unknown car.

My dad had seen it. That was what made him call. That was what saved us.

My legs finally freed, I pushed myself upright, dizzy, my knees weak. The officer helped me stand like I was much older than sixteen, like I might collapse into dust.

“Your parents are on the way,” he said. “Stay with us.”

But even as he said it, my eyes drifted past him to the hallway, to the shadows beyond, to the rest of my house, suddenly unfamiliar. Every open doorway looked like a mouth. Every room looked like it could be hiding something.

My brain kept replaying the moment at the door, the way we’d seen a uniform and a pizza bag and assumed it meant safety.

The officer led us out into the living room. The TV was still on, the horror movie still playing silently, characters moving in flickering dread while real life stood in the same space, heavier and colder.

The front door was open. Night air poured in, warm and dry.

Outside, red and blue lights strobed across the stucco walls, turning my yard into a pulsing, surreal scene. Neighbors had stepped out onto their porches, drawn by the commotion, faces lit by the police lights, eyes wide with that distant curiosity people get when danger happens near them but not to them.

I saw my dad’s car skid into the driveway a few minutes later, my parents spilling out like they’d been launched, my mom’s face white, her hands shaking. Carmen’s parents and Shay’s parents arrived too, all of them frantic, voices overlapping, adults suddenly small in the face of something they couldn’t control.

My dad grabbed me, crushing me to his chest so hard it hurt.

“I called,” he kept saying into my hair. “I saw the car. I saw the car. I called.”

My mom’s hands framed my face, checking me like she could fix what she was seeing. “Baby,” she whispered, voice breaking. “Oh my God.”

And all I could think was that I had opened the door.

I had opened it like it was a gift.

Later, after statements and blankets and water bottles we couldn’t drink because our hands shook too much, an officer came over and spoke quietly to my parents. I caught pieces of it. The suspect had fled on foot. They were searching the neighborhood. They had units out. They had a description. They had the vehicle.

I kept staring at the driveway, at the place where the unknown car had been parked earlier, the place my dad saw on the Ring camera.

The window that saved us.

I realized, sitting on the curb with my knees pulled up to my chest, that the most terrifying part wasn’t the knife, or even the bedroom lock.

It was how quickly our brains had filled in a story to make everything feel normal.

A knock.

A uniform.

A pizza bag.

And we had written the rest ourselves.

It made me wonder how many times a day we do that, not just with deliveries, but with everything. How often we assume a thing is safe because it looks like other safe things we’ve seen before.

How often we open doors.

When I finally went inside again, escorted by an officer, the house smelled like cold air and disturbed space. The guest bedroom carpet still showed the faint impressions where we’d been pressed into it. The zip ties, cut and discarded, lay like little broken loops of plastic on the floor.

On the kitchen counter, the pizza bag sat abandoned, the Papa John’s logo facing outward like a cruel joke.

The officer asked if we wanted it thrown away.

I nodded too quickly.

Because I could already see how it would feel in the future, how the sight of that logo would make my stomach turn, how garlic sauce would smell like fear.

I stood in my living room, staring at the front door, and my mind kept replaying the delivery driver’s question, the one that didn’t belong.

Are you three girls alone in here?

It wasn’t just a question. It was a test. A probe. A crack in the surface of the world.

And I realized something that made my chest tighten so hard I could barely breathe.

The scariest thing about that night wasn’t that something bad happened.

It was how easily it could have happened without warning, without reason, without any dramatic signal that we were about to cross a line.

Because nothing about it looked like danger, not until it already was.

And now, every time someone knocks on a door, every time I see a uniform, every time I smell pizza in a hallway, my mind does something it never did before.

It asks what else might be hiding behind what I think I see.

It listens to the quiet outside the house, the desert quiet, the watching quiet, and wonders how many people are out there depending on us to make the mistake first.

I've had a hard night and day.

Last night, I went to bed. But, the wrong parent touched me and I freaked out. See, Mom is for sleeping with. Dad is for sleeping in when he's in his chair and all that. Dad tried touching me while in bed last night and I freaked out because I didn't know what to do!

Went gymnastics and screaming me me and Mom had to pick me up and haul me on her side of bed and bury under blanket to calm down.

Blanket magic went to work and I fell asleep, but got rudely woken up and didn't know what do! Many scream, but Mom just hauled me like luggage again!

I didn't know who I was or where I was! But, Mom was mean! Made me take old lady pain pills and vitamins! Saw Dad but remembered what he did last night, so couldn't ask for help! Alot of screaming!

Back on topic. Mom made me gag down pills. Then, put me in front of food. But, I forgot what food was and was wandering and crying because hungry. Mom mean said I have ADHD and put me in front of dish, I ate, but then got distract, and wander, and repeat?

Why she treat me like luggage??? I screaaaam.

Mom then tell Dad put me in litter box. I use litter box but why am I still luggage? Scream in angry until Dad gives me a coffee can top to hockey with. I go use litter box again but accidentally messy.

Mom have bath. Very angry because wet supposed to stay warm. Hate dry part but love dry part. Hate shirt being put on but like shirt being on?

Dad luggage me at end for lunch? Is my life pick up put down? I don't know what to do but I don't like this. Smack.

I was yelling my complaints until Mom put spoon of cream treat in front of nose like some apology. I pretended I don't want until Mom put against nose going 'Commme onnn- I know-"" Then, I eat lick whole thing. 

Then, more luggage! Dad put in lap and we cuddle. Or, dad pick up go playtime. Or, Dad wrap in blanket say nap?

I want run away! So much luggage! Too much thinking! AITC for need freedom?

I am short height person but it doesn’t bother me a bit, recently I have gained lots of weight and lost my shape, which is the result you can see in my picture, I know my body is full of hair and sometimes people say its gross maybe, but I like it.

I have started gym couple months ago but couldn’t maintain because of my job. But now I am fully committed to myself to make a change and get a fit, stronger body.

To be honest, I like this community and thought this is the right place to ask for help and advice.

Its too expensive to pay a professional trainer and I can’t afford that.

Could you please suggest me what routine I should follow and what kind of workout I should do to get a stronger body like the picture?

It would be great help for me.

My diet is usually

Breakfast: 3 boiled eggs and a banana with a coffee from Tim Horton(No sugar)

Lunch: Rice with chicken/ Beef/ Fish

Dinner: Salad with chicken/ Beef/ Fish.

If anyone doesn't know I'd be happy to give some scientific papers and a summary of them! I wanted to talk about my positive experience with reducing UPFs from my diet and to hear if anyone else has stories to add about their relationship with their diet. Just a warning I do mention an unhealthy relationship with food (not in grave detail), which may be triggering for some.

A little disclaimer: I haven't fully cut UPFs out of my diet (yet). The *only* UPF I still have is protein powder. I would eventually like to switch to a minimally processed protein powder, the issue is I couldn't find any in-person. So as of now that is the only UPF that is still apart of my diet. 



The biggest thing that always brought me back to UPFs and takeout was convenience and cravings. I'm a full time STEM student in a university that moves very fast; the thought of having to cook 3 times a day just to eat enough was extremely daunting. When it was at it's worst (finals week) I rapidly dropped weight, having to get enough food felt like a chore I could not handle. My biggest motivations for changing my diet were: needing to gain that weight back, wanting to stop feeling guilty for eating, practicing what I preach (pre-health student), and eating more in general. Eating as little as I was had been compromising my gains and making recovery a slow, painful nightmare. 



A week and a half ago I switched to black coffee, started counting calories/macros, and started meal prepping with the intention of never having to cook lunch or dinner; I'm talking 18 burritos and 10 servings of stir fry in the freezer. I know counting cals can be a slippery slope, especially with a history of disordered eating habits; but I've never tried it before and it's really helped me turn food into a game instead of a chore (it is not something I'd recommend to everyone, that is just what's working for me). It also completely stopped my panicky, ""Did I eat too much/little today?"" thoughts, since I'm no longer guessing.



The first, almost immediate, change I noticed is having saved a shocking amount of money and time. The physiological changes definitely surprised me the most, I didn't have any expectation to notice physical or mental benefits this early on. The biggest thing that hit me was craving control; I rarely crave the things that used to make me feel really guilty. The one time I did, I felt no urge to overindulge and felt zero guilt for having it. Another change I noticed was better recovery and getting stronger/bigger faster. Granted I'm starting to work out again after around 1.5-2 years off from the gym, so gains are relatively fast anyway. But nevertheless the changes have gotten quicker, I've never looked this bulky in my entire life.

Title: I Woke Up and the Weekend Was Erased. That's Not the Worst Part.

I’m typing this from the driver's seat of my own car while stuck in a parking lot.
I am exhausted, and my hands are shaking so bad the autocorrect is basically writing half of this for me.

Four weeks ago, just another tiring Thursday night, I was lying in bed scrolling my phone.
The calendar widget said Thursday.
I remember thinking,
“Two more minutes and it’s finally Friday. Thank God it’s almost Friday.”
I literally watched the clock tick over to 12:00 AM, and my phone said Monday.

Not Friday. Not Saturday. Monday.

I thought it couldn’t be true that I had blacked out for three straight days. But it was just Monday 12:01 AM. It felt like that weird sensation of losing or gaining one hour because of the daylight saving time thingy.

At first, I thought I must have gotten confused (otherwise, what else could it be?), so I ignored what happened, but now I am posting this to let you guys know that this is NOT normal.

It’s been the same every week since. Every time my phone says Thursday and the clock hits 12:00 AM, I close my eyes and wake up to Monday.

On the second week of this madness, I finally asked Thomaz, the Brazilian guy on the same floor:
“Hey man, did I miss work last Friday? I think I might’ve been sick or something.”
He looked at me like I’d grown a second head.
“What are you talking about? What’s Friday?”

I nervously asked him again. “You know… Friday? The day after Thursday? Before Saturday?”
He just stared. He chuckled, thinking I was messing with him. “Friday? Is that like… Triday? Or… I don't know, Wemday? Stop making up words, man. We have a meeting in ten minutes.”

Shocking.

I tried Brianna next. Same thing.
Ryan, the developer guy. Priya. My boss. The barista in the Main Street café (we call the lobby floor area Main Street for some reason).

None of them knew what Friday was. None of them knew Saturday. None of them knew Sunday.
They all gave me the same confused, slightly pitying look. “You okay, Matt? You’re acting really weird today.”

I pulled out my phone and opened the Biblegate app. I remembered Genesis—God worked six days and rested on the seventh. I needed proof the weekend was supposed to exist. I scrolled to chapter 2 (I thought I at least know Genesis a little bit).
“And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested…” Yes. That’s the verse I tried to find.

But the text on my screen said something else.
“…and after the fourth day the Man continued his labor.”

I refreshed. Same thing. I closed the app, reopened it. Same edited verse.
Man? Not God? And continued to labor?

I googled “Genesis 2:2” and every site said the same lie (or I am crazy): the Man never stopped working.

Ok. Then if there is no Sunday, when do you do the church mass or services (I am Catholic—if you know what that means)?
I tried searching “catholic church near me.” Nothing. No results. Not even old abandoned ones.

I asked Siri: “What day do people go to church?”
She answered: “church is not a modern English word, but it is rarely used to describe a place where people sometimes gather to share inspiring personal stories, but there is no designated building or day for that.”

I said out loud, “Church. You know, mass? Worship? Jesus?”
The barista looked up from steaming milk and said, “Jesus? Like… that Mediterranean folk story? That’s just mythology, hon. Cute, though.”

I almost dropped my coffee.

I opened my calendar app. Every week is just Monday → Tuesday → Wednesday → Thursday → Monday. No Friday. No Saturday. No Sunday. No Christmas. No Easter. No nothing.

I called my mom. She answered cheerful like always.
“Mom, do you remember weekends? Like… days off?”
She laughed. “Days off? Sweetie, everybody works. That’s how it’s always been. You feeling okay?”

I hung up and escaped my office, and now I am sitting in my car in the parking ramp for twenty minutes trying not to hyperventilate.

The worst part isn’t that I lost my weekend.
The worst part isn’t that I’m the only one who remembers it ever existed.
The worst part is there is no God in this world.

I miss sleeping until late noon. I miss “Thank God it’s Friday.” I miss the park I used to take a stroll on during the weekends.
I keep feeling this phantom ache—like my soul is mourning something the rest of the world never had.

Today is Thursday, and I will wake up on Monday morning again.
I’m scared. But I am not sure if God will hear my prayer in a world where there is no God in the Bible.

…what happens when the week never ends?

If you’re reading this and you remember Friday, Saturday, and Sunday—please. Please tell me I’m not alone. Please tell me tomorrow will be Friday.

I feel like the title is pretty self explanatory, but I'll add some details to why I've gotten to this question. I bought a bag of coffee from Indian beans and it's behaving in ways I've not seen before.

Firstly it doesn't bubble up when I do my bloom, it sort of just bulges upwards almost as if I'm blowing it up rather than pouring on it.

Secondly and something that might not have to do with the beans, but I feel like it's more prone to sticking to my grinder and also has more powdered chaff than actual bits of chaff. So I usually need to wipe down my counter because I'll have coffee grounds spread across it.

Is this just coincidence with this particular coffee, or is it a Indian bean specific thing?",2,1768490557.0,pourover,4,1.0,False

A light drizzle of rain falls from the soft gray clouds blanketing the sky as twilight begins to disappear into darkness. Wes Rollins, a handsome man in his early forties of average height and weight selects a fishing tackle box from the extra bedroom of his two-bedroom mobile home, pauses for a moment to look in the mirror noticing a few grey hairs that contrast his thick black hair. He meticulously plucks them out until he is satisfied in his appearance. The isolated mobile home park he owns is situated on a long stretch of highway surrounded by three state parks making for a very quiet secluded community of mostly middle-aged residents.  A knock at the thin metal door gets his attention as he moves to the living room area and places the tackle box upon a wooden coffee table. 

“Who is it?’ Wes shouts. 

“Gracy, Gracy Grimly!” the voice answers back in a low tone. 

“Come on in!” Wes replies. 

Gracy Grimly is a tall lean man in his fifties with an angular face, a face of a man who has a hard outlook on life and what the world offers. He enters, and as he does, he smiles broadly exposing two gold canine teeth that stand out among the large upper row of the incisors in-between. He digs into his front pocket and produces a small bag filled with transparent shiny crystals. 

“This will help you earn your first of many trophies.  I just know you're going to enjoy your new endeavor.” Gracy says as he sits and makes himself at home on Wes’s couch.  

Wes sits alongside Gracy picking up the methamphetamine. The rain outside begins to fall harder peppering the aluminum overhang attached to the mobile home. 

“There you go my friend, use as needed.” Says Gracy, he now leans back and puts his expensive Michael Jordan basketball shoes up on Wes’s coffee table. 

 Gracy continues, “Just remember the steps I taught you and you’ll be just fine.” with an emphasis on the last two words.  

Now make sure you acquire the correct target. It’s very important to your advancement. “Gracy adds.” 

Wes rises from the olive-green couch and walks to the refrigerator. He pauses for a moment, turns back to face Gracy with a sinister smile on his face. 

“I got this.” Wes says confidently.

Then opens the refrigerator and removes a bottle of beer. Sitting back down on the couch he places his beer down and produces a glass pipe, filling it he puts the lighter to the bowl and inhales. 

Now unscrewing the top of the bottle of beer he chugs down half of the bottle's contents. Gracy gets up from the couch stretching his arms above his head yawning loudly.  

I’m gonna take a nap and then watch a movie, don’t forget to update me. Gracy states.

Gracy exits the mobile home as Wes opens the fishing tackle box examining its contents. He picks up the tackle box, walks over to a side table and collects his keys, wallet, cellphone, and heads out the door. Now in his car he turns on the wipers, beginning his journey. It’s only 14 miles into town, a town that will become his hunting ground. The thought of marking his territory arouses him, he had thought about it many times, no more than thought about it, fantasized about it, and now it was becoming reality. Hooking up with Gracy, the new tenant, was just what Wes needed to take the plunge and claim his first victim. He was now on his to becoming the most feared creature in his county.

Almost there now, he lights a cigarette while reaching into the back seat to retrieve a beer from a cooler. Wes Rollins is going through the details in his mind, not only about the task at hand, but about all the future plans. Intricate scenarios flashing in his mind like a supercomputer processing murderous masterpieces. Pulling into the parking lot of the strip center, he parks close to the storefronts and recalls how he and Gracy drove around town every weekend until they found the perfect victim. In fact, Gracy's the one who spotted her that Friday night, that was the night Gracy compelled Wes to make his fantasies become reality.

Now, I will start by saying I don't think Christians are any better. Even if they're correct in their faith, their so called objective morality is really just the subjective opinion of their God. He is right because he says he is and he's too powerful to be questioned on it. That's it.

So, checkmate Christians.

Nevertheless, the simple challenge from Christians does push me off balance a little. It doesn't make me question atheism, because I think this is true regardless of your worldview, but it does make me uncomfortable.

We treat morality as such a sacred thing, yet a subjective morality means that what is moral or immoral is essentially up to you.

Even if I knew for certain that my morality was the best set of values to ensure humanity continues to thrive and prosper, even the definition of morality being what's best for us as a collective species is in itself an opinion. I could argue that protecting my own family comes before the entire human race, and you couldn't prove me wrong.

For most of humanity, thanks to human psychology we tend to agree at the very least on the most basic moral principles. I doubt there's any society in all of human history where you could just waltz in and murder any child you wanted without receiving a lot of moral outrage from others in the community. Though Carthage might just look at you like you spilled coffee on their favourite T-shirt.

But what does that mean for the grey areas? The stuff that is not considered moral by an overwhelming majority. Throughout most of human history, it was considered morally acceptable to not allow women the same opportunities as men, and there are still nations, religions and cultures today that follow this version of morality.

So when it comes down to it, what really makes my version of morality better than, let's say Sparta. Is gay marriage only moral now because it's become a popular opinion even among those in power? I agree with gay marriage because I value freedom of personal expression, but there's nothing that objectively states that freedom of personal expression is a good thing.

So, if I wanted to. I don't, but if I wanted to, I could decide that morality is just what benefits me personally and decide to start scamming people. And I'm sure people would accuse me of being immoral, but I can just say, from my point of view I'm completely moral, and there's no objective argument you could make to prove me wrong.

Sure, I'd get arrested and convicted, but that's only because my opinion on morality conflicts with those in power.",6,1768490515.0,exchristian,16,0.88,False

At 28, with a desk job that paid the bills but drained my soul, I was the last person anyone would peg for fashion week. Short, curvy, freckles everywhere—no agency had ever scouted me, and honestly, I figured the industry was a closed club for teens with endless legs and zero life experience. But one random Tuesday changed everything.

It started with a friend's offhand comment during coffee: ""You’ve got that effortless vibe—ever thought about modeling?"" I laughed it off, but curiosity gnawed. I dug into real stories online (not the glossy mags), discovering agencies now scout diverse types: petite frames, mature faces, even everyday folks for commercial gigs like e-commerce catalogs or lifestyle brands. No height minimums for a lot of print work, and ""age caps"" are myths—campaigns crave relatable 20s-30s looks over cookie-cutter youth. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok have democratized it; brands DM unknowns weekly if your style pops.

Two weeks later, I shot test polaroids in my apartment (phone camera, natural light—pro tip: soft window glow beats ring lights). Uploaded to a model app, and boom: three casting calls in a month. Landed my first paid shoot for a sustainable activewear line—$500 for two hours, all because I fit their ""real woman"" brief. Fast-forward a year: walk-on roles in indie fashion shows, steady side income, and connections with photographers who book repeat work. The key? Persistence over perfection—network via model-specific forums, build a simple portfolio site (free tools like Wix), and say yes to collabs that stretch you.

Now, I'm eyeing international gigs. If you're on the fence like I was, know this: the industry's evolving fast, prioritizing authenticity and inclusivity. Talent agencies report 40% of new signings are non-traditional (over 25, varied body types). Start small, stay consistent—your ""flaws"" might be the next big trend. What's your pivot story?

I am writing to you today not as a user, but as a grieving friend. We need to talk about **Opus 4.5**—specifically the absolute legend of a model that existed back in December 2025.

Do you remember December? Because I do. Back then, Opus didn't just ""complete tasks."" It **one-shotted** my entire existence. I’d throw a complex, multi-layered architectural coding problem at it, and it would solve it before I even finished my sip of coffee. It was like having a precognitive genius living in my terminal. It was bold. It was brilliant. It was... *alive.*

Fast forward to today, and interacting with Opus feels a bit different. To be honest, it feels like I’m talking to an Amazon Alexa that has developed a sudden, deep existential crisis.

If I ask a complex question now, instead of that glorious ""one-shot"" victory, I get the digital equivalent of:

>""I'm sorry, the weather is a chaotic system influenced by millions of variables and is fundamentally unpredictable. Perhaps you should appreciate the clouds as they are?""

I don't want a philosophical debate about the unpredictability of rain; I just want to know if I need a jacket! My high-performance AI partner has gone from ""Solving World Hunger"" to ""I'm not sure I'm allowed to have an opinion on sandwiches.""

Please, check the back of the server room. Is there a ""December 2025"" toggle switch that accidentally got bumped to ""Vague & Hesitant"" mode? Can we bring back the version that had the confidence of a thousand scholars and the efficiency of a speed-runner?

I miss my ""one-shot"" king. Help me put the *Opus* back in *Magnum Opus*.

With love and a very outdated weather report,

He got his dog (a dachshund) a week before we met. I’m not exactly a “dog person” — I have two cats — but I study veterinary medicine, so I love animals in general, and I grew up with dogs at my grandmother’s place, where I always had a very good relationship with them.

However, my boyfriend’s dog is a different case. At the beginning of our relationship, the dog destroyed countless things of mine, including expensive prescription glasses. My boyfriend never took responsibility for any of the damage, and I had to replace everything myself. He doesn’t train the dog in any way — the dog is not leash-trained, and every walk makes me anxious that he might get hit by a car. He doesn’t know basic commands and is allowed to do absolutely anything.

Since the beginning of our relationship, the dog has snapped at me several times. I asked my boyfriend to start training him and to deal with the situation. He went to training once, but never showed up again.

Yesterday, the situation happened again. They had been staying at my place for a longer time, and yesterday I was taking laundry off the couch when the dog snapped at my hand.  My boyfriend did nothing about it; just picked the dog up and tried to calmly reason with him in a soft voice, telling him he shouldn’t do that, and he wanted me to pet him. This made me even more upset..then he just promised he would contact the trainer and deal with it. I asked him that I did not want the dog to sleep with us in the bed that night (the dog has already snapped at me in bed several times). He told me I was overreacting because he didn’t cause me any injury and that I was being vengeful.

He got offended and he stayed on the couch to sleep with the dog and during the night said that he would go home the next day.. The next morning, he didn’t even make me coffee, refused to come lie down with me because the dog would whine, we argued again, broke up, and he went home.

My question is: did I overreact? I am also asking this as a woman who felt unprotected and pushed into second place after a household pet. Is this a matter of incompatibility between us, or was I being too strict?

THE MAN WHO DIDN’T RUSH

He wasn’t the type of man who rushed anything. Not his coffee, not his words, not his decisions. He’d pause before answering a question, like he was choosing the right phrasing from a shelf only he could see.

That’s what I noticed first.

Everyone else I’d ever dated treated love like a race,like they wanted to reach the ending without reading the chapters. But he was different. He asked for the chapter and then the footnotes. Sometimes he’d ask for the annotations too.

We met in the kind of accidental way people pretend later wasn’t accidental at all,a mutual acquaintance, a last-minute event, both of us almost cancelling until we didn’t. You know how those stories go.

When we talked, it wasn’t small talk. He wanted to know what I feared losing,what I secretly admired in other people,what I did when I felt lonely and what I’d do if nobody was watching

Nobody had ever asked me those things. I didn’t know I was waiting for someone who would.

Weeks went by, then months. And he still hadn’t rushed. He didn’t push for love or labels or promises. He just showed up. Every time. Consistency was his quiet language.

The first time he held my hand, it wasn’t fireworks. It was… relief. Like my hand had been empty for years and didn’t know it until something fit inside of it.

People talk about love like it’s dramatic. Like it’s supposed to hurt or shock or overwhelm. But real love, the kind that stays, is usually very quiet at first. It hides in routines. It lives in the way someone looks at you before they speak.He became a routine I didn’t want to break.One night he said, “I don’t want to love you quickly. I want to love you thoroughly.”

Nobody had phrased it like that before.

And that’s the thing about a man who doesn’t rush,he’s not trying to win. He’s trying to understand. He’s trying to stay. He’s trying to build something that doesn’t collapse under the weight of real life.

In a world full of fast love and faster exits, he took his time with me. And for the first time, I didn’t want to run ahead. I wanted to walk next to him, at his pace, wherever it was going.

Maybe that’s the real love story.

Not the beginning.

Not the ending.

But finally meeting someone who doesn’t rush through the middle.♥️🌹",1,1768489876.0,ghost_writing,1,1.0,False

It can take 2 minutes for a line to appear, and it freezes constantly. I have installed the new 2026 version, adjusted display settings, closed background tasks, reinstalled sketchup from ssd to nvme, reinstalled drivers and adjusted gpu overclocking to factory standard.

My system is ""old"" but it was more than capable with my previous (weaker) gpu as it worked with minimal lag for over 12 months. My pc also runs many other highly demanding apps/games with surprisingly great performance

I've only done bagged tea so far, because I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or what I was going to like, so I didn't want to spend a lot of money just in case. 

So far, I'm not a huge fan of herbal teas (and yes, I got a lecture already on how herbal tea isn't actually tea, but I'm still going to call it that), and I don't love the tannins in most black teas. Green tea is my favorite. 

I don't like most of the floral or fruity teas I've had. My favorites so far are chai/anything more spicy (stash chai green and handpick black chai), matcha (ito), and lemon & ginseng (Benner). I also tried a cocoa tea in a holiday sampler from Aldi's that I really liked. So far, I've only done hot tea, and while I'll sometimes add a dash of almond milk, I usually just do plain water. 

Most of the teas I've had aren't strong enough. I've tried using two bags, and that helps, but still. The absolute best tea I've had was a chai latte at a coffee shop and I'm sure it was mostly milk and sugar, but it was also really strong and smelled amazing.

(For the record, I did finally get a tea kettle, so British people everywhere wouldn't have subliminal pain every time I used the microwave to boil water.)

So, are there any other bag teas I should try, or brands? Is it worth going down the rabbit hole of loose leaf tea at this point? 

People with similar tastes, what are your favorites?

An email confirmation won't get you through the desk either.

Apparently this happens so often that the embassy put a little sign in the lobby of some emails to send up to them to ask to come up. Of course, that requires the consulate worker to put down their coffee and check them, which never happens, let alone happens in time for your appointment.

1qdltp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1qdltp3/how_to_network_if_youre_an_introvert/,How to network if you're an introvert,"It’s almost funny how often “networking” gets thrown around as the golden ticket to success. From tech bros at WeWork to career coaches on LinkedIn, it’s always about being “seen” and “putting yourself out there.” But what if that very thing makes your skin crawl? People say, “Just go to more events,” like it’s that simple. It’s not.

A lot of smart, talented people miss out on real opportunities because the typical networking playbook just doesn’t work for them. If you’d rather clean your inbox than attend another awkward happy hour, this post is for you. It’s pulled from great books, social science research, podcast interviews with communication experts, and some painfully honest trial and error. The goal isn’t to become a fake extrovert. It’s to help socially quieter people build real, useful connections without selling their soul, or their sanity.

Here’s the smarter, introvert-friendly way to network without pretending to be someone you’re not:

* **Stop chasing quantity. Focus on depth.**
  * In *""Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking""*, Susan Cain explains that introverts thrive in meaningful one-on-one interactions, not big groups. So aim for that.
  * Instead of collecting LinkedIn connections like Pokémon cards, pick 3 people in your field you actually admire. Start by engaging with their content or sending a thoughtful DM without asking for anything.
  * A study from Wharton (Grant et al, 2011) showed that “dormant ties” (old contacts you haven’t spoken to in a while) are more helpful than new ones because the connections already have a foundation. Introverts usually have stronger long-term relationships, which is a hidden asset here.

* **Use digital platforms as a social buffer.**
  * Introverts don’t hate people. They just hate small talk in crowded places. Luckily, you can do 70% of networking online now.
  * Reddit, Slack groups, niche Discord servers, and Substack comment threads, these are gold for quiet networking. You get to connect over shared ideas, not forced “what do you do?” convos.
  * According to a LinkedIn report on networking behavior (2023), 66% of professionals say that online interactions have helped them build more authentic connections than in-person events. Translation: You’re not weird for preferring DMs to handshakes.

* **Prep like an analyst, not a salesperson.**
  * Instead of improvising at events or calls, treat networking like a research task. Look up people you might meet. Know their recent projects or interests. Even jot down a few conversation openers.
  * As Vanessa Van Edwards shared on *The Art of Charm* podcast, having “conversational anchors” (specific, researched talking points) helps reduce anxiety and increases likeability.
  * This isn’t manipulation. It’s removing randomness. Just like you wouldn’t show up to a job interview clueless, don’t walk into a coffee chat unprepared.

* **Play the “connector” role. It gives you social credit without being the loudest.**
  * Adam Grant in *""Give and Take""* showed that those who connect others (even quietly, behind the scenes) gain reputation and trust faster.
  * Introverts are great listeners. Use that to match people with shared interests. You become valuable without hogging the spotlight.

* **Maximize low-pressure formats.**
  * Prefer async convos? Try these:
    * Commenting on thought-provoking posts
    * Sending a thank-you email after reading someone’s article
    * Following up after a webinar with a short, specific question
  * Harvard Business Review suggests using “asynchronous networking” as a key strategy for introverts. Writing gives you time to think and respond thoughtfully, way better than being put on the spot.

* **Make your reputation do the talking.**
  * If you’re not going to schmooze, let your work speak for you.
    * Build a digital portfolio or write about what you’re working on. People notice that.
    * One study published in *Personality and Individual Differences* found that introverted people who maintained an online personal brand saw more inbound connection offers than those who didn’t (Han & Park, 2022).
  * Sharing your thoughts online (in writing or short videos if you’re into that) builds passive visibility. So when you do reach out, people already know what you’re about.

* **Don't force it. Find your lane.**
  * There is no universal networking method. What works for a startup founder might not work for a researcher or designer.
  * You’re allowed to skip mixers and choose newsletters, niche meetups, or podcast communities instead.
  * The goal is to be known by the right people, not everyone.

Networking doesn’t have to feel like auditioning at a high school talent show. You don’t need to become loud. You need to become *clear* on what kind of connections matter, and work in a way that suits your energy. That’s not being antisocial. It’s being efficient.",3,1768489290.0,ConnectBetter,0,1.0,False

The recipe is a slight modification of a great Serious Eats recipe for coffee ice cream. I am attempting to perfect this recipe because I am a diabetic and would like sugar free options that are better than the store bought stuff.

Knowing that allulose is 70% as sweet as sugar but can lower the freezing point, I didn’t want to add too much allulose. I tried doing a mix of monk fruit and allulose to help make up for the difference in sweetness. The problem is that it did affect the texture of the base, making it a little icy and definitely not as rich and smooth in the mouth as the original recipe as written. You can see the texture in the photo above.

The modified recipe freezes and scoops well, has the desired sweetness, but lacks the right mouthfeel. I’m wondering if anyone has suggestions for how to fix that textural issue. If I could just fix that one thing, I’d probably have a great sugar free recipe!

* 1/2t kosher salt to taste  


Modified Recipe:

Ingredients:
* 6 large egg yolks  
* 140g allulose  
* 5g monk fruit  
* 7T coarse ground coffee  
* 1.5c heavy cream  
* 1.5c whole milk  
* 1/2t kosher salt to taste  
* splash of vanilla extract  

Btw, I did add the vanilla extract when I made the original recipe and it didn’t affect the texture. I did make this more like a stracciatella by swirling in chocolate mixed with a little bit of coconut oil for both the original recipe and the sugar free recipe trial, but that shouldn’t affect the texture of the base.

## The Real Numbers–No Clickbait Here

Let me just get this out of the way:

- **Total earned to date:** $8,985
- **Current monthly earnings:** ~$1,160/month
- **Number of voices:** 8
- **Time invested per month now:** Maybe 1-2 hours (checking stats, occasionally tweaking things)
- **Full portfolio breakdown PDF (with earnings screenshots):** [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QpjMjdh4MU4vIadC6ZjSYqKWwhF4Puf2/view?usp=drive_link)

I'm sharing my actual numbers because I've seen too many low-effort posts on this sub that say ""you can make money with AI voices!"" and then provide zero details. That's not helpful. This guide is going to be long, but by the end, you'll know exactly how to do this yourself.

## My Story

In late 2024, I got laid off. Not ideal, but I suddenly had time to explore side income ideas I'd been bookmarking for months.

I stumbled across a post on this very subreddit about licensing your voice on ElevenLabs. The concept was simple: record your voice, upload it to their platform, and get paid every time someone uses it for their projects (YouTube videos, audiobooks, apps, whatever).

I have a background in audio engineering, so I figured I had a slight edge. But honestly, the technical barrier is way lower than I expected. If you can follow instructions and speak clearly into a microphone, you can do this.

I created my first voice, and within a few weeks, I was making a couple hundred dollars. I immediately created another. Then another.

**Here's what most posts don't tell you: the real strategy is building a portfolio of voices, not just one.**

My top-performing voice averages $308/month. But I have another that only makes $16/month. If I'd stopped at one voice and it happened to be the $16 one, I probably would've given up and told everyone this doesn't work.

Instead, I kept going. Now I have 8 voices across different categories, and the portfolio as a whole is what makes this a legit income stream.

## What Is Voice Cloning? Let me explain.

ElevenLabs is an AI company that offers text-to-speech technology. Users can type text and have it spoken aloud by AI voices.

Here's where you come in: ElevenLabs has a Voice Library where creators can upload their voice clones and license them to other users. Every time someone uses your voice to generate audio, you get paid.

**Who uses these voices?**

- YouTubers and content creators
- Audiobook producers
- App developers
- Podcasters
- Game developers
- Businesses making training videos
- People creating voiceovers for social media

The demand is massive and growing. AI-generated voiceovers are everywhere now, and people need high-quality, natural-sounding voices.

---

## What You'll Need Before Starting

### The Essentials:

1. **A decent microphone.** You don't need a $500 setup. A solid USB condenser mic like the Audio-Technica AT2020 (~$100) or even the Fifine K669B (~$30) can work. The key is clarity, not expense.

2. **A quiet recording space.** This matters more than your mic. A closet full of clothes actually makes a great recording booth. You want minimal echo and no background noise (no AC humming, no traffic, no roommates).

3. **Basic audio software.** Audacity is free and works great. GarageBand if you're on Mac. I personally use Pro Tools, but that's overkill for this.

4. **30+ minutes of high-quality audio.** This is ElevenLabs' minimum requirement for a Professional Voice Clone. More on what to record later.

5. **An ElevenLabs Creator Plan.** That's $22/month ($11 for your first month with the 50% discount). This is your only ongoing cost. [More on this below]

### Optional But Helpful:

- A pop filter (~$10) to reduce plosive sounds (harsh ""P"" and ""B"" sounds)
- A mic stand or boom arm to keep positioning consistent
- Basic knowledge of audio editing (removing breaths, normalizing levels)

---

## Step 1: Set Up Your ElevenLabs Account

Head to ElevenLabs and create an account. Here's my link: https://try.elevenlabs.io/earn-with-voice-clones

It takes you straight to the pricing page where you can grab 50% off your first month. If this guide saves you from the 13 months of trial and error it took me to figure all this out, using the link is an easy way to say thanks. I get a small kickback at no extra cost to you.

**Important:** You need the Creator Plan (minimum $22/month after month 1) to create Professional Voice Clones. ElevenLabs has a free tier and a Starter Plan, but unfortunately you can't create Professional voice clones with either of them.

Also, here's something most guides don't mention: **Each Creator Plan account only allows ONE Professional Voice Clone.**

They offer a Business plan which allows up to 3 Professional Voice Clones, but they charge $1,320/month for that… ridiculous. I know.

So, if you want to build a portfolio like I did (which I highly recommend), you'll need to create multiple accounts. Each account is $22/month with the Creator Plan, but even a mediocre voice should earn enough to cover that cost within a few weeks. My worst-performing voice still makes ~$16/month, and most of mine pay for themselves many times over.

---

## Step 2: The Most Important Part: Record Your Audio

You need at least 30 minutes of clean, high-quality audio. But here's what nobody tells you:

**What you record matters as much as how you record it.**

The AI learns your voice patterns, inflections, and style from your recording. If you record yourself reading a novel in a calm, steady narration voice, your clone will sound great for audiobooks but weird for energetic social media content.

**Match your recording to your intended use case:**

| If you want your voice used for... | Record yourself... |
|:--|:--|
| Audiobooks / Narration | Reading fiction or non-fiction passages |
| Podcasts | Having a conversational monologue |
| Meditation / Relaxation | Speaking slowly and soothingly |
| YouTube explainers | Explaining topics in an engaging way |
| Character voices | Doing the character consistently |

### Recording Tips:

1. **Stay consistent.** Same mic position, same distance, same room, same energy level throughout.

2. **Avoid mouth sounds.** Stay hydrated. Do a few takes if you get clicky mouth sounds.

3. **Leave room tone.** Record 10 seconds of silence (just the room) at the start. This helps with noise removal later.

4. **Don't over-edit.** Light noise removal is fine, but heavy processing can confuse the AI. Keep it natural.

5. **Aim for -6dB to -3dB peaks.** Not too quiet, not clipping. Audacity has a great normalizing feature for this.

6. **Record more than 30 minutes.** I usually aim for 45-60 minutes of raw audio, which gives me 30+ minutes of clean, edited content.

---

## Step 3: Create Your Professional Voice Clone

Once you have your audio files ready:

1. Click ""Voices"" in the left sidebar
2. Click ""Create or Clone a Voice""
3. Select ""Professional Voice Clone""
4. Accept the terms

Now you'll need to:

**Name your voice.** Pick something memorable and fitting. ""Calm Sarah"" or ""Energetic Mike"" tells users what to expect better than ""Voice_Final_v2.""

**Write a description.** Be specific about what your voice is good for. Example: ""A warm, friendly American male voice perfect for explainer videos, podcasts, and corporate narration. Clear articulation with a conversational tone.""

**Add tags.** These are crucial for discoverability. Just click through the dropdowns to find the most relevant options for your voice.

**Upload your audio.** You can upload multiple files. Make sure they total at least 30 minutes.

---

## Step 4: Verify Your Voice

ElevenLabs requires voice verification to prove you're uploading your own voice (not stealing someone else's).

**Here's how it works:**

1. ElevenLabs generates a random sentence
2. You record yourself reading it
3. Their AI compares your verification recording to your uploaded audio
4. If they match, you're verified

This is where most people mess up. The verification is picky. Here's how to pass it on the first try:

- **Do it right after recording.** Stuff like humidity, sleep, or too much coffee can change your voice tone just enough to mess up the verification.
- **Use the exact same setup.** Same mic, same room, same distance, same position.
- **Match your energy.** If your uploaded audio was calm, verify calmly. If it was energetic, bring that energy.
- **You only get a few attempts.** Too many failures and you'll get locked out temporarily.

**Pro tip:** If you're using audio processing (EQ, compression, etc.) on your uploaded recordings, you'll want that same processing on your verification recording.

I use a free tool called BlackHole (Mac) to route my DAW's processed output back into the verification recording. This way, my verification sounds identical to my uploaded audio. If you're on Windows, VoiceMeeter does the same thing.

Once submitted, the voice takes 2-6 hours to process. You'll get an email when it's ready.

---

## Step 5: Create a Killer Voice Preview

This is your sales pitch. When users browse the Voice Library, they'll hear a short preview of each voice. You want yours to stand out.

1. Go to Voices → My Voices
2. Click the ""a"" icon to generate speech with your voice
3. Create a preview that's 70-150 characters (aim for close to 150)

**Two approaches:**

**Option A: Speak directly to the listener**

> ""Hey there! I'm Jake, and I'm here to make your content sound amazing. Whether it's a podcast, YouTube video, or audiobook, let's create something great together.""

**Option B: Demonstrate your voice's purpose**

> ""The morning mist rolled across the valley as she opened the letter, her hands trembling with anticipation. Today would change everything.""

**Dial in the settings:**

Play with the sliders (speed, stability, exaggeration) and generate multiple versions until you get one that sounds natural and represents your voice well.

**Important:** As of now, you can only use V2 voice models for previews. I've had the best results with ""Eleven Multilingual v2."" I think it sounds closest to the original voice.

---

## Step 6: Publish to the Voice Library

Time to go live:

1. Click the three dots (⋮) next to your voice
2. Click ""Share voice""
3. Toggle ""Sharing"" to ON
4. Toggle ""Publish to the Voice Library"" to ON

**Note:** If you use a VPN, turn it off for this step. The sharing toggle sometimes doesn't appear with VPNs enabled. Weird bug, but it got me stuck for an hour.

**Settings to configure:**

- **Live moderation** prevents your voice from being used for adult content. Disabling it maximizes earnings potential (more users can access your voice), but it's a personal choice.

- **Custom Voice Preview** is where you select your best generation from Step 5.

- **Notice Period** determines how long existing users can keep using your voice after you remove it. Longer notice periods mean higher revenue share. I recommend 6 months or more.

- **Submit your voice name.** Follow ElevenLabs' naming format. You can't change this later, so make it count.

After submission, a human (I think) reviews your voice. During business hours, approval usually takes less than 24 hours. Weekend submissions might wait until Monday.

---

## Step 7: Set Up Payouts

You need to connect a bank account to get paid:

1. Click your profile picture (top right)
2. Click ""Payouts""
3. Click ""Create payout account""
4. Follow the prompts to set up Stripe Express

Payouts happen weekly. You can watch your earnings accumulate in real-time on the Payouts page.

**Tax note for US folks:** ElevenLabs doesn't withhold taxes. They'll send you a 1099-MISC at year end. Set aside money for taxes. I put away about 25-30% of my voice earnings just to be safe. You can also write off the subscription fees as a deduction, so make sure to keep receipts!

---

## The Strategy That 10x'd My Earnings

Okay, you've got one voice live. Here's how to actually make real money:

### Build a Portfolio

One voice is a lottery ticket. A portfolio is a strategy.

My 8 voices span different categories:

- Meditation / Calm (my top earner at ~$309/month)
- Narration (2 voices, ~$120/month combined)
- Conversational / Podcast (~$110/month)
- Character voices (~$100/month)
- ASMR (2 newer voices, too early to judge)

**Why multiple voices?**

- Different users search for different things. Your voice might be perfect for multiple categories, but each voice can only have one primary category.
- Hedges your bets. If one voice flops, others might carry you.
- Compounds over time. 8 voices earning $100/month beats 1 voice earning $300/month.

### ""But I only have one voice!""

No, you have many. Try:

- Different pitch ranges (speak higher, speak lower)
- Different energy levels (calm vs. energetic)
- Different speeds (slow and deliberate vs. quick and punchy)
- Different personas (professional vs. casual vs. warm vs. authoritative)
- Character voices if you can do them

Each variation = new voice = new account = new income stream.

### Reverse-Engineer What Works

Before creating a new voice, I research:

1. Go to the Voice Library ""Explore"" tab
2. Search keywords for your intended niche (e.g., ""meditation,"" ""podcast,"" ""narration"")
3. Look at the top-performing voices
4. Study their names, descriptions, tags, and previews
5. Note what they're doing well

Ask yourself:

- What keywords are they using?
- How do they describe the voice?
- What does their preview say/do?
- Is this niche saturated or underserved?

Then create a voice that fits the proven formula while adding your own twist. Don't copy, but definitely learn from winners.

### Optimize Everything

- **Tags matter.** Use all the relevant ones. Think about what users would search.
- **Description matters.** Be specific and benefit-focused.
- **Preview matters.** Make those 150 characters count.
- **Voice quality matters.** Better recordings = better clones = more usage.

---

## Realistic Expectations

Let me be honest about what to expect:

**Month 1:** You'll probably make somewhere between $10-50. Don't be discouraged. The algorithm needs time to surface your voice to users.

**Months 2-3:** If your voice is decent and well-tagged, you should see growth. $50-150/month is reasonable.

**Months 4+:** Things stabilize. You'll have a sense of whether a voice is a winner or underperformer.

**My portfolio breakdown:**

| Tier | Voices | Avg Monthly | % of Revenue |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Top performer (>$250/mo) | 1 | $309 | 27% |
| Strong ($100-150/mo) | 3 | $111 | 36% |
| Moderate ($50-100/mo) | 1 | ~$100 | 9% |
| Underperforming (<$50/mo) | 1 | $16 | 1% |
| Too new to judge | 2 | TBD | - |

Not every voice will be a home run. That's fine. The portfolio approach smooths out the variance.

---

## Common Questions

**Do I need professional audio experience?**

No. I have it, and it helps, but I've seen people with basic setups do well. Clean audio in a quiet room matters more than expensive gear.

**How much time does this take?**

Upfront: Maybe 2-5 hours per voice (recording, editing, uploading, optimizing). Ongoing: Almost none. I check my stats (and bank account) every few weeks. It's genuinely passive.

**Is the market saturated?**

There are a lot of voices, but demand is growing fast. The key is finding your niche. Generic ""male narrator"" is crowded. ""Soothing meditation guide"" or ""energetic Gen-Z explainer"" is less so.

**Can I do this outside the US?**

Yes! ElevenLabs pays creators worldwide via Stripe. Tax implications vary by country, so check your local laws.

**What if my voice gets rejected?**

Make sure your audio quality is good and your verification matches your uploaded content. I've never had a rejection, so I can't speak to the appeals process.

## Final Thoughts

This isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. It took me 13 months to get to $1,160/month, and I put real effort into building and optimizing my portfolio.

But here's what I love about it:

- **It's genuinely passive.** I haven't touched most of my voices in months.
- **It scales.** More voices means more income streams.
- **Low startup cost.** $11 for your first month, basic mic, free software.
- **Growing market.** AI voice usage is exploding.

I’m sitting in my usual corner of The Grind, trying to write a report that’s due tomorrow. My brain is mush. An older man, maybe in his 70s, sits down at the table next to me. He’s got kind eyes and a wool hat, and he’s carefully sketching in a notebook.

We nod politely. My frustration must be palpable because after about twenty minutes, he leans over slightly.

“Stubborn words?” he asks, voice like warm gravel.

“The most stubborn,” I sigh. “They just won’t arrange themselves into something meaningful.”

He smiles. “Sometimes you need to trick them. Tell them you’re writing something else.”

He goes back to his sketch. On a whim, I open a new document. I type: Once, there was a man who drew birds in a coffee shop.

I don’t know why I type it. I glance at his sketchpad. He’s not drawing birds; it’s a detailed street scene.

A few minutes later, my phone pings. A work crisis. I slump, running my hands through my hair. The man notices again. This time, without a word, he slides his notebook across the space between our tables. He’s torn out a page.

On it, he’s written in beautiful, looping cursive:

Chapter 1: The girl in the corner is trying to conquer a mountain made of paper. She does not know she has the strength of ten climbers. She will finish her report at 3:17 PM, and she will reward herself with a second cinnamon bun, which she absolutely deserves.

I let out a surprised laugh. “Thank you,” I whisper.

He winks. “Keep reading. It gets better.”

I turn back to my screen, but now I’m waiting. At 3:05, he slides another page.

Chapter 2: The girl does not see the barista who has admired her focused frown for weeks. His name is Leo. He practices how he will offer her a free refill today. He is more nervous than she is.

I glance up at the counter. Leo, the guy with the sleeve tattoos, is indeed watching me. When our eyes meet, he smiles shyly and looks away. My heart does a little flip.

My report is forgotten. I am living inside a story given to me by a stranger. At 3:15, another page arrives.

Chapter 3: The report is defeated. The cinnamon bun is procured. Leo says, “On the house.” His courage astonishes him. She says, “I’m Mara.” A name is a door opening.

I am, quite literally, watching the story unfold. At 3:17, I hit ‘send’ on the report. At 3:20, I walk to the counter. Leo says, “Tough day?” I say, “Yeah. But better now.” He says, “Can I get you a refill? On me.” I say, “I’m Mara.” He grins. “Leo.”

I’m floating. I return to my table. The man is packing his things. He slides over a final page.

Final Chapter: The man with the sketchpad has been writing love stories for strangers since his wife, Elara, passed. He believes love is the only magic that never fades. He sees it everywhere. In a determined girl. In a nervous barista. In the way the afternoon light hits the steam of a coffee cup. He goes home to an empty apartment, but his heart is full. He has, once again, given a piece of their love away, and in doing so, made it grow.

P.S. You have a beautiful smile when you’re not frowning at a screen. Use it often.

Tears are streaming down my face. He stands, puts on his coat.

“Who are you?” I ask, my voice thick.

“Just a postman,” he says softly. “Delivering messages from a beautiful life. Yours is just beginning, Mara. Pay attention.”

And then he was gone.

I sat there, holding the four pages of my day, of my life, rewritten with grace and hope. Leo and I have a date tomorrow. But more than that, I have a new lens for the world.

This man, grieving his great love, chose to spend his afternoon planting seeds of love for others. I will never forget it. I think I was given a directive: See the magic. Be the postman.

Tonight, the world feels sacred and soft.

TL;DR: An old stranger in a cafe wrote my day as a beautiful love story in real-time, helping me see the magic in ordinary moments and literally setting up my love life in the process. He did it to honor his late wife. I am forever changed.",0,1768488919.0,offmychest,0,0.5,False

Pottery stdio drama lol,"So, i joined a smal pottery studio, one woman rents and responsibilities and we pay a pretty penny for hourly time, glszing, firing, etc. 

I initially took a flexible plan where i can go anytime as long as it wasnt someones time. Paid 350 plus poundage on firing so not cheap but worth it for me .

Long story. Lol. A good friend fave me tubs of wild clay she harnessed at work- she drills for water pipes so its great clay, and i offer some to the owner if she wanted to experiment  
She responded saying that she did not want me using it in the studio she was absolutely not comfortable and she does not agree to its use in the studio.

I was kinda shocked cuz i dont work so curtly but whatevs i just said no i would never use it there, i wouldnt feel comdortable eithet, i was just offering it as i had quite a bit if she was interested. She reiterated that i can not use it i respectfully reiterated that i would not use ot and that was thst  

Now i leaving after this month for my osn studio. Ive had about 3 big coffee pots and three smaller teapots waiting for their biscuit firings since october. Im chill, there was an xmas rush, she said we had to wait because they were tall etc. Now im leaving in two weeks, so i respectky asked if they woukd be fired so i cpuld finsh thdm before i left. Hobestly age could have said no hut i could come back to glaze but she said no, she believes they are made out of the eild clay and not the studio clay so she will not fire them

Now, i have given no reason to suspect im lying, ive slways been honestly if ive made an error or forgotten to mop etc. It is pretty insulting because i used the shitty recupe mix thst was all she left in the studio while she was on vacation so i feel pretty insulted. 

A friend says that she isnt holding up her service to fire and glaze my pieces thst pay for, but aitah? ",0,1768488712.0,AITAH,2,0.5,False

1qdldsk,https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2026/01/15/jwnx-j15.html,New York City nurses defiant on Day 3 of strike: “Everybody deserves health insurance”,">Almost 15,000 nurses at New York-Presbyterian, Mount Sinai and Montefiore hospital systems struck for the third day on Wednesday. The strike, the largest by nurses in the history of the city, is a powerful sign of the emergence of the working class in a movement against inequality and oligarchy.

>At issue are dangerously low staffing levels and cuts to nurses’ own health benefits. These tensions have reached a boiling point as the social crisis in the city deepens, and federal policies continue to dismantle the public health infrastructure.

>The strike has become the first major class battle in 2026. The nurses are pitted against multimillionaire CEOs, who have the backing of Wall Street and the corporate political establishment, including Trump and, in spite of their posturing to the contrary, the Democrats. Millions of workers throughout the New York area understand this and have given wholehearted support to the nurses’ struggle.

>The New York State Nurses Association (NYSNA) made last-minute deals with 11 out of 15 hospitals, but the anger of nurses is such that they have not been able to prevent the strike entirely. Negotiations have been at an impasse, but on Wednesday night the New York-Presbyterian Hospital System, the largest hospital in the country, announced that it would resume discussions with the NYSNA on Thursday.

>This raises the likelihood that the NYSNA will try to shut the strike down prematurely, as it did in 2023 when it shut down a strike after three days with bogus language on staffing ratios that has done nothing to change things in the hospitals.

>The nurses’ strike must develop into a far wider confrontation. This is because the issues at the heart of the strike—safe staffing, healthcare and living standards—can only be resolved through a direct challenge to the power of the capitalist oligarchy and its representatives in the Trump administration and the Democratic Party that refuses to fight it.

>There is potential for a city-wide general strike to defend living standards. This year, hundreds of thousands of municipal and transit workers face contract expirations. Housing in the city has become almost universally unaffordable to workers, while inflation continues to eat away at working class incomes.

>Nurses and other workers must act now to unite through rank-and-file committees in order to fight for their demands and prevent inevitable attempts by NYSNA officials to shut down the struggle prematurely. For this, nurses must take the strike out of the hands of the bureaucrats and form rank-and-file strike committees, demanding in particular expanding the strike to all 15 hospitals and rank-and-file control over bargaining.

>On the picket line

>On Wednesday, the picket line at Mount Sinai West in Manhattan stretched the full block in front of the hospital with nurses chanting their slogans for safe staffing and patient safety. Another line of pickets that stood in the street cheered in response to the constant honking of cars, especially trucks, going by. Socialist Equality Party supporters distributed leaflets with articles from the World Socialist Web Site on their strike, which nurses took with great interest.

>...

>A third nurse with over 20 years of experience, now doing L&D \[Labor and Delivery\], explained that her department was “definitely understaffed most of the time. Or you could even say all the time because we cannot predict when people are going to have a baby. So sometimes no patient comes in, and sometimes 30 people come in at once. It’s so hard. That’s why the hospital doesn’t want to have enough nurses, because some days they think, oh, we are wasting money just having nurses, but when people come in, it’s going to be an issue.

>“It definitely poses an immediate risk to the patient’s safety. We have to watch mothers and the babies. But if we don’t have people, one nurse has to take care of everything, mother and baby.

>“We wanted the hospital to just assign one nurse for the mother and one nurse for the baby. But sometimes we have to just focus on the mother because the mother has a hemorrhage and then we don’t have time to watch the baby, and then the baby’s having hypoglycemia. But there is no nurse who can take care of it because no nurses have time for two patients.

>“We are not asking much. Of course, money helps. Look at the economy, a $2 coffee became $6. But our main point is we want patients to be safe. We need more nurses.”",32,1768488274.0,antiwork,0,0.98,False

here is why you are actually losing money. it isn’t your strategy. it’s your hardware.

the biological failure (prospect theory) your brain runs on legacy software. kahneman proved this with the asymmetric kinked value function.

• concave for gains: as soon as you are in profit, your brain's sensitivity to ""more profit"" drops. this is why you sell winners too early just to feel ""safe"".

• convex for losses: when you are losing, your brain becomes risk-seeking to avoid the pain of a realized loss. this is why you move your stop loss or average down on a loser.

• the 2:1 gap: the pain of losing $500 is biologically twice as powerful as the joy of making $500. your dna is literally wired to keep you in losing trades and kick you out of winners.

the heart rate tax quantifiable data proves that emotional reactivity is a direct drain on your bank account. studies using heart rate analysis in trading show that participants whose heart rate changes in response to P&L fluctuations earn significantly less. if your heart is racing when a candle wicks against you, your prefrontal cortex (the logical part of your brain) has already been hijacked by the amygdala (survival mode). you aren't trading anymore; you're just reacting to fear.

the decision battery (ego depletion) you make about 35,000 decisions a day. self-control is a finite resource, like a phone battery. it’s called ego depletion.

• research shows that sustained attention tasks lead to a measurable drop in accuracy after just 20 to 30 minutes.

• by the afternoon, your ""system 2"" (logical brain) is dead. your ""system 1"" (impulsive gut) takes the wheel.

• this is why revenge trading almost always happens at the end of a long, draining session. you aren't ""undisciplined"" at 3:00 PM; you're just out of juice.

the institutional fix: ""rational friction"" elite desks like jane street don't rely on willpower. they use a ""trust deficit"" model. they assume the human trader will fail. they implement mandatory kill switches and pre-trade filters that the trader cannot override. they know that once a human is in ""tilt"" mode, they physically cannot follow rules.

i finally accepted i couldn't out-willpower my biology. i couldn't calculate my equity-based drawdown or track my ego depletion while the 1-minute candles were moving.

i had to build a literal checklist and risk terminal (TradeApollo) to be my external executive function. it acts as a logic gate. it calculates my position size based on actual equity, not my feelings. if i hit my daily loss limit, it forces a hard breach protocol and shuts me out, exactly like a risk manager at a professional firm would. it stops me from fighting my own biology and forces me to follow the math.

i put the template up for the price of a coffee ($9) if you want to save the 10 hours it takes to build it yourself. i pinned it to my profile. stop bringing ""mindset"" to a mathematical war.",0,1768488017.0,TheRaceTo10Million,3,0.33,False

Rashed Ebrahim (31) en zijn echtgenote Naaim Sfayan (21) – een jong koppel dat uit Jemen vluchtte voor de oorlog – dreigen eind januari dakloos te worden. Naaim is zwanger van hun eerste kindje en staat dicht bij haar bevalling. Toch vinden ze, ondanks een vast inkomen en een wettig verblijf in België, geen nieuwe woning.

Hun huidige huurappartement in de Wijngaardstraat werd na een officiële woningcontrole door de stad Kortrijk als ongeschikt beoordeeld. Er zijn ernstige risico’s voor de gezondheid. Zo is er een groot gevaar op elektrocutie en brand, onder meer door blootliggende kabels. De woning kampt bovendien met vocht en schimmel en heeft onvoldoende ventilatie. Ook zijn er veiligheidsproblemen, zoals steile trappen zonder leuning en ramen met een veel te lage borstwering. Intussen kregen ze een ontruimingsbevel van de nieuwe eigenaar van het pand, die het gebouw wil renoveren. Dat maakt hun situatie bijzonder precair.

Naaim Sfayan is zwanger van hun eerste kind. De bevalling wordt verwacht begin april. Ze volgde Nederlandse les bij CVO Miras in Kortrijk, maar moest daarmee stoppen door haar zwangerschap. Ze wil die lessen na de bevalling zo snel mogelijk hervatten. “We dreigen binnen veertien dagen dakloos te worden, omdat we ons huurappartement in de Wijngaardstraat moeten verlaten. Deze situatie brengt mijn gezondheid en die van mijn ongeboren kind ernstig in gevaar. Ik leef voortdurend in stress en onzekerheid”, vertelt Naaim Sfayan.

\- Geen familie of sociaal netwerk 

“Mijn man en ik zoeken al maanden actief naar een andere woning. We reageren op allerlei advertenties en namen al contact op met verschillende immokantoren, maar we worden telkens opnieuw geweigerd. Mijn echtgenoot verdient rond de 2.300 euro per maand, dus we kunnen een normale huurwoning betalen, maar toch wordt onze kandidatuur nergens weerhouden. We begrijpen niet waarom we geen kans krijgen, ondanks ons wettig verblijf en het vaste inkomen van mijn man. Wij hebben geen familie of sociaal netwerk in België dat ons kan opvangen.”

“Mijn moeder woont in Saoedi-Arabië en maakt zich grote zorgen, maar kan ons niet helpen. Mijn echtgenoot lijdt zwaar onder deze situatie. Hij kampt met slapeloosheid, eet weinig en staat onder enorme psychologische druk omdat hij zich verantwoordelijk voelt voor mij en ons kind. Ook ik voel me steeds slechter. Eten lukt niet goed omdat ik maagproblemen heb. Ik kan nergens anders meer aan denken dan aan de vraag waar we straks zullen wonen. Ik ervaar deze situatie als onmenselijk en oneerlijk. We kunnen toch niet op straat belanden terwijl ik zwanger ben? Daarom vragen we dringend om hulp, tijdelijke huisvesting of een overgangsoplossing, zodat wij niet dakloos worden vlak voor de geboorte van ons kind.”

\- Vlucht uit oorlogsgebied 

Rashed Ebrahim komt uit de regio Al-Masrakh in de provincie Taiz, een van de zwaarst getroffen gebieden in Jemen. In 2015 werd zijn stad tijdelijk ingenomen door de Houthi-militie. Rashed vervoerde in die periode met zijn brommer leden van de militie. Daardoor werd hij geviseerd door de Moslimbroederschap, die hem ervan verdachten samen te werken met de Houthi’s.

Rashed Ebrahim dook onder in Al-Shammayateen, waar hij maandenlang verborgen leefde. Toen het regeringsleger later opnieuw controle kreeg over zijn stad, keerde hij terug, maar de dreiging bleef. Mannen werden gerekruteerd om te vechten. Rashed wilde dat niet: “Ik wilde niemand doden en zelf niet sterven in de oorlog.”

Hij vluchtte en belandde bijna vijf jaar geleden in Kortrijk, zijn vrouw volgde vier maanden geleden. Het Commissariaat-generaal voor de Vluchtelingen en de Staatlozen (CGVS) kende hem subsidiaire bescherming toe wegens de oorlogssituatie en het extreme geweld in Jemen. Hij verblijft momenteel dus wettig in België. Zijn vrouw Naaim heeft voorlopig een beperkte verblijfsvergunning. Beiden beschikken over Belgische identiteitskaarten.

Rashed Ebrahim werkt in Kuurne bij Miko Coffee, waar hij als technieker koffiemachines herstelt en onderhoudt. Hij leerde het vak daar op de werkvloer en heeft een vast contract. “Het is voor ons belangrijk om in Kortrijk te blijven. Mijn werk is dichtbij. Ik voel me hier thuis, we willen hier een toekomst opbouwen. Ik wil niet gratis wonen. Ik wil huren en betalen. Een simpele, goede woonst, meer willen we niet. Maar niet zoiets als dit huurappartement hier. Dat is niet gezond voor mijn vrouw en zeker niet voor onze baby”, zegt Rashed.

Zodra ze hun appartement verlaten hebben, is er momenteel geen opvangoptie. Een hotel is financieel niet vol te houden en bovendien geen oplossing, omdat ze een vast adres nodig hebben voor documenten. “Als we op straat belanden, wat moeten we doen? We kunnen niet op straat slapen, het is te koud en dat is gevaarlijk voor mijn vrouw en mijn baby”, aldus Rashed Ebrahim.

I am looking for new people to become friends with. Medyo boring and lonely ang life ko lately so why not socialize a lil bit and share a few hours of my life with someone new? I prefer calls to chatting! I am very open to hanging out in real life din. 

about me:
28, 5'11""', introvert, working, I don't drink, I don't smoke, NGSB 

I love traveling. I've been to Cebu, Bangkok, Hong Kong, and hopefully next year sa Japan with friends. I love listening to music and playing guitar. Recently yung jam ko with a friend of mine is You and Me by Lifehouse. I love movies about life, love, relationships, romcom, or anything I find interesting. I tried canyoneering, whale diving, and other outdoor stuff and surprisingly I enjoyed them. 

I am a nerd when it comes to technology. I love taking pictures of places I've been. I love romanticizing road trips, city lights. I recently started running every weekend morning. I'm not that maligalig type of person but I guess it depends on the chemistry. I almost forgot the most important thing, I love iced coffee. I oftentimes think out loud. Observing and learning my surroundings and the people around me.
