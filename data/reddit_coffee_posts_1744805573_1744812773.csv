I wanted to share my experience at the [coworking space at **250 E 200 S**](https://www.spacesworks.com/salt-lake-city/250-e-200-south/) (the old WeWork location, now run by REGUS/IWG). I’ve been working here for a while, and it’s honestly such a hidden gem—great views, a *super* nice interior, and plenty of spots to move around and work from. Plus, it’s **only $230/month for a dedicated desk**, which feels like a steal compared to other downtown options.

The location is perfect; it's right in the heart of downtown, steps from Beer Bar, Bar X, The People's Coffee, and other great lunch/happy hour spots. The only downside is that it's still pretty quiet in here since they’re building the membership base. I joined to have a ""work life"" again (WFH was killing me), and I’d *love* to have some coworkers to share the space with!

If you’ve been looking for an affordable, well-located spot with great amenities, come check it out! Happy to answer any questions about my experience as well.

1k0l996,https://www.reddit.com/r/GatoInary/comments/1k0l996/why_game_designers_should_learn_to_code_and_how/,Why Game Designers Should Learn to Code (And How to Start Without Losing Your Mind),"As a game designer, you might think your job is all about crafting epic stories, balancing mechanics, and making sure players don’t rage-quit after the first level. But here’s a secret: knowing even a little bit of programming can save you from becoming *that* designer—the one whose brilliant ideas make developers question their life choices.

# 1. Speak the Same Language (Or at Least a Few Words)

Imagine pitching a revolutionary ""dynamic, physics-based, procedurally generated destructible environment"" to your programmers… only to hear: *""That’s… not how any of this works.""*

Basic coding knowledge helps you:

* **Understand feasibility** (No, your AI companion can’t ""just learn"" from players… yet.)
* **Communicate clearly** (Instead of ""Make it fun!"" try ""Can we tweak the jump force variable?"")
* **Prototype faster** (No more waiting weeks to test a simple mechanic.)

👉 **Try:** Start with visual scripting (Unreal Blueprints, Unity Bolt) or basic Python.

# 2. Debug Your Own Ideas (Before Someone Else Has To)

Ever handed a ""simple"" design doc to a developer, only to watch their soul leave their body? Knowing code lets you:

* Spot impossible requests (*""Why can’t the NPCs have 10,000 unique dialogues?""*)
* Fix small issues yourself (*""Oh, the health pickup just needs a collider? Got it!""*)
* Avoid being the reason the dev team orders more coffee.

👉 **Try:** Play with modding tools (like Minecraft’s command blocks) or tweak variables in existing games.

# 3. Become the Ultimate Problem-Solver

Game design is problem-solving, and code is just another tool. Even if you never write a full game, understanding:

* **Basic logic** (if-else, loops)
* **How engines work** (variables, components, events)
* **Why your ""easy fix"" broke everything**

…makes you a better designer.

👉 **Try:** Follow a simple Unity or Godot tutorial—no pressure to become an expert!

# 4. Future-Proof Your Career

The line between designer and ""technical designer"" is blurring. Studios love hybrids who can:

* Script events
* Tweak gameplay data
* Work directly in-engine

Plus, you’ll finally understand why the devs keep muttering about ""null references.""

👉 **Try:** Learn Lua (used in Roblox, Love2D) or C# (Unity).

# Final Boss Advice

You don’t need to be a coding wizard—just literate enough to:  
✔️ Read and tweak scripts  
✔️ Know what’s *actually* hard to implement  
✔️ Avoid being the ""idea person"" who gets quietly voted off the team

Now go forth, and may your hitboxes always be perfectly aligned!

So I was wondering — would going to a football or basketball game be a good first date idea? I feel like it might be easier to talk when there’s something fun going on, and if the conversation slows down, we’d still have the game to enjoy and talk about.

The studio is completely unmanned and just has screens on the walls and reformer beds with ""classes"" running every 45 minutes.

The studio was usually empty when we first started going so we got into the habit of chatting a little through the class. The chit chat honestly gets me through the class as I'm pretty unfit and find the class hard. We are busy working mums so can't hang out after and have a coffee as we need to get back to the kids. We count those few random sentences as our socialising for the week.

We don't talk the whole way through but just when we have something come to mind or we joke about some of the harder exercises. We're not treating it like a coffee date, we just chat a little here and there and we whisper when we talk.

A few times there has been an older lady there who has told us to be quiet basically the second the screen says ""Welcome to your class"". Making it obvious she expects total silence.

I wouldn't talk at an instructor led studio or at a yoga class, but I kind of see this studio more like a gym where I would feel fine about a little chit chat while doing weights or cardio.

Are we wrong for chatting in this context? I'm thinking of changing to an earlier class time to avoid this lady but curious as to if you think others are also expecting total silence.",1,1744812270.0,TwoHotTakes,3,1.0,False

Backstory. My daughter’s teacher started her first year this late December half way through the year. She is a blessing! My daughter didn’t speak really until she was five, wasn’t potty trained until five …. We were so worried she was going to struggle. Her Kindergarten teacher did amazing. But starting first grade her first teacher was having some health problems and was very forgetful about things and I noticed my daughter having a hard time. She was already in speach therapy and had been given an IEP. Since her new teacher started my daughter has progressed to spelling and reading third and fourth grade level vocabulary and is currently now doing inverse subtraction, long addition, and long subtraction. And on her own has started writing in cursive. We work with her a lot at home with the math but the reading, writing,  and getting my daughter to the level where she is now is all because of her. Her teacher is now making separate reading and spelling assignments for my daughter to challenge her. She is testing way above where she is expected to be. My husband and I are over the moon with the progress. And our daughter got Principal’s List. 

I wanted to get her something and I was at a local nursey; in the gift shop was a local made coffee mug that had the classic apple with a worm on it and it was gorgeous. I decided I was going to make her an easter basket. I got the mug, then we went to a local bakery and got her some vanilla and orange crème chocolate carrots, a small bag of local coffee, some honey tea cubes, some tea flowers, some coconut chocolate candies, and a very nice small iron wire basket with a hardwood bottom. ( maybe 5x7” and 4” tall. ) I added some easter grass and then I got her some MoroccanOil shower gel. My daughter and I packed it all into the basket and I sent her off to school. 

Now I’m a nervous wreck…. All the comments online with teachers proclaiming no coffee mugs! No soaps….. Did I fudge up? ",1,1744812259.0,AskTeachers,0,1.0,False

So. There’s this… thing… now. Isn’t there? Artificial. Intelligence. AI. (Pause. Looks vaguely disappointed). 

They keep… talking about it. On the… internet. Which I… try to avoid. Obviously. Full of… opinions. Usually the wrong ones. Often about me. (Slight, pained smile).

But this AI… apparently… it can do… things. Drive cars. Diagnose illnesses. (Scoffs softly). And… apparently… it can… write jokes. (Long pause. Stares at a point slightly above the audience’s heads).

Right.

So… people ask. Well. Not people. You know. Industry types. Or… someone corners me after a gig. Reeking of… craft ale and misplaced confidence. And they say… ""Stew,"" (Pulls a face) … no one calls me Stew… ""Stew, have you thought… have you thought… about using… AI… to… generate… some… content?""
(Looks physically pained). Generate. Content. Like it’s… yoghurt. Or… electricity. Just… churn it out. Fill the… comedy void. Because apparently… there’s a void. Needs filling. Constantly. With… content.

And the answer… the answer is… (Leans into mic slightly) … no. (Pulls back. Frowns).
Obviously. No.

Why? (Looks around as if genuinely expecting an answer. Silence). Why would I? Where… where is the… art… in that? Where is the… (Waves hand vaguely)… the agonising… process? The… staring at a blank page… for three days… in a room… probably in Stoke Newington… the heating’s packed in… again… and the only thing you’ve written is… ‘Maybe something about… bins?’ (Pause). And then deciding… no. That’s… that’s too populist.

That’s the process. That’s the… integrity. Isn’t it? The… the self-doubt. The… despair. The… slow, grinding realisation that you might… actually… have… nothing… left to say. (Pause). And then… maybe… finding one… tiny… little… observation… about… the structural deficiencies of modern conservatory roofing… and spending the next… six months… trying to hammer it… into… something… vaguely… amusing. To… twelve people. In Leicester. On a Tuesday.

That’s artistic integrity. It’s… fundamentally… inefficient. It’s… painful. It requires… me. (Taps chest weakly). My… specific… set of… failings… and… minor intellectual triumphs.
An AI… it doesn’t have… failings. Does it? It hasn’t spent… years… reading negative reviews… by Alan Connor… or whoever it is this week. It hasn’t… felt the crushing weight… of audience indifference. It hasn’t… forgotten the middle section… of its own routine… and had to… improvise… badly… about… badgers. For ten minutes.

You feed it a prompt. ""Write a joke like Stewart Lee."" (Scoffs). And it… what? It accesses… data points? It correlates… mentions of… Thatcher… the Guardian… coffee shops… repeats a phrase… three… no, five times… adds a… structurally unsound analogy… mentions Chris Moyles… and spits out… something.
(Mimics robotic voice) ""Why did the liberal elite cross the road? Because the focus group data indicated a 73% probability of finding artisanal sourdough on the other side. This statement will now be repeated. Why did the liberal elite cross the road…""
(Shakes head slowly). 

It’s… soulless. Isn’t it? It’s… the opposite of what this is. Or… what I pretend this is. Which is… (Searches for the word) … human. Flawed. Probably… too long. Definitely too long.
So, no. No AI. Not for the… jokes. 

Maybe… maybe I could get it to answer the emails. (Small chuckle to himself). ""Dear Stewart, I found your show pretentious and boring."" (Robotic voice) ""Thank you for your feedback. Your opinion has been logged and correlated with 7,492 similar opinions. Statistically, you are correct. Have a nice day.""

That… that might actually save me some… agonizing. But the jokes? No. They have to be… carved. Out of… silence. And… disappointment. My disappointment, mainly. Which you pay… (Checks watch hypothetically) … quite a lot… to witness.

So. You’re stuck with… this. Organically sourced… misery. Farm-to-table… ennui. Not… generated. (Pause). Right. Good. Glad we cleared that up. Now. Where was I? Ah yes. Bins… No, wait… conservatories…

I already have my license for Nova Scotia and am interviewing with Nova Scotia Health Network. I'm 30 years old, single, straight & male. My hobbies are music, cinema, coffee and nature. I also like going to the gym (mostly for sauna). 

My role would be for either short stay orthopedics or general medicine at Halifax Infirmary. 

I have a few questions. Is it possible to find affordable studio/1 bedroom apartments in Halifax? Can anyone who is an RN speak to the conditions of working on such at unit at Halifax Infirmary (short staffing, ratios, patient behavior, amount of PTO, etc.)? At $41 CAD per hour would I be able to have a decent life with cost of living in an area like Halifax? Also, socially is it easy to make friends?

Not gonna lie. I'm not thrilled about the fact that I can only work nights/variables on a general medicine floor but as an immigrant these are the only options they are willing to offer me. I think it would be worth it since the DSA (Divided States of America) is turning into a medieval wasteland.

Please let me know if there is anything else i'm missing that i should be asking.

* **Why were January and February unprofitable?** Was it seasonal (e.g., post-holiday slump), weather-related, or operational?
* **What changed in March** to bring profitability? Was it a marketing push, event, or staffing change?
* Are all **household salaries truly operational roles** (baristas, manager, etc.) or are they padded in?
* Do you have a list of **recurring expenses** — coffee supplier, milk, pastries, etc.?
* Do you and your family withdraw your salary in cash or is everyone also processed as part of the general payroll, therefore being subject to things like payroll taxes etc.
* What is the total salary being taken out by the family per month?
* Would you be able to provide us invoices, sales tax filings, and POS statements for at least these 3 months? What about tax returns for 2024, 2023, and 2022?
* Based on the P&L’s provided for the past 3 years, there’s an average loss shown of about 50 – 60k per year after Owner’s salary + Payroll tax is included into the Cost of Goods + Labor. Is that the actual loss?
* It said in the CBA that your family handles the food ordering and other administrative oversight. So does that mean you all also run things like payroll, monitor inventory, and handle scheduling?
* Do you provide medical insurance for anyone?
* What are your **peak hours and slow periods**?
* What % of sales are **drinks vs food/pastries**? Restaurant vs drive-through?
* Do you sell **bags of coffee, merchandise, or gift cards**?
* Are you using **loyalty programs or email/SMS marketing**?
* Do you offer **delivery** via Uber Eats, DoorDash, etc.? If so, how much monthly revenue comes from those?
* What’s your **POS system** and does it provide customer analytics or sales trends?
* Do you use any inventory management software like MarketMan or do you manage the inventory yourself?

* Do you take **online/mobile orders**?
* Can I review the **lease agreement**? Any rent increases or obligations coming up?
* Is the **equipment leased or owned**? Age of major equipment (grinder, refrigeration, etc.)?
* Are all the **health permits, fire inspections, and licenses** current?
* Does the building require any upcoming major repairs?
* Do you host **events or pop-ups** (e.g., open mic, local art)?
* Any **partnerships with other businesses** (e.g., bakeries, schools)?
* Is there enough demand to **add catering or wholesale**?
* Do you see potential in **expanding hours, adding brunch items, or private bookings**?

Every sip felt like a lightning bolt of knowledge, and as my eyes darted nervously around, I started to feel like the star of an offbeat horror-comedy.

Out of nowhere, Jill a notorious privileged Ross student known for drinking 5 shots of Vodka at a time without a care in the world with a penchant for the dramatic leapt out from behind a stack of oversized novels. I barely had time to register her sudden appearance before a jolt of terror (or was it caffeine-induced hyper-vigilance?) sent my heart into a frenzy. In that split second, the coffee shop transformed into a haunted dojo where every shadow seemed a lurking enemy and every stray whisper an omen of impending doom.

The shock awakened my so-called “super saiyan alpha instinct,” and suddenly, I was no longer the sleep-deprived student hunched over endless notes. My body, fueled by a bizarre cocktail of caffeine and adrenaline, morphed into a martial arts warrior incarnate. With moves that would shame any low-budget action flick, I launched into a flurry of chops and kicks that were as accidental as they were absurd. In the chaos of flying napkins and startled gasps, my unintentional assault nearly ended Jill’s reign as the undisputed jump scare champion of the coffee shop.

As the caffeine buzz began to ebb away, the absurdity of my overly dramatic martial arts display settled in alongside a mix of embarrassment and lingering adrenaline. Jill, wide-eyed was laying on the ground in a pool of fear, and dread. She realized her antics were inappropriate, and that she had gotten more than she bargained for. I mumbled at her ""this is why you don't mess with me."" Her eyes widened, she was in fear. I sat back in my seat wiped the dirt off my Armani jacket and went back to the grind.

Friends!  I’m over-the-moon and wanted to share this story. It's long. Buckle up.

I think I just met someone in the wild.

TL;DR and Spoilers: >! Went to a strip club. In conversation, discussed the topic of sugar dating. A dancer read our entire Seeking profile and provided her number. We have a M&G set up for this week. !<

——— Part One, Intro.

I’ve been better, this year, about hanging out with my guy-friends.  Due to the excuses of work or family commitments, I’ve often neglected the boys in my life (the very ones who stood up front in my wedding party eleven years ago). Some guys have a unique ability to just “pick things up” where they left off with their close friends, which is something, I’ve unfortunately, grown too accustomed to.

So I began reaching out to plan days out with each of them toward the end of last year.  One on one.  Whether it’s a video game night or screaming at the football game at Buffalo Wild Wings.  I’m there. Whatever they want.

One of these close gentlemen, Michael (fake name), enjoys attending a local strip club, which he often does by himself.  He has close friends that dance there, so it’s quite a different experience for him; he’ll hand over a fifty and just have a couple girls sit, gossip, and share raunchy memes all night.  Honestly quite wholesome.

I haven’t been to a strip club in five or so years. Lacy (fake name, and the girl of this duo) is unable to patron such an establishment due to occupational risk, even though she may potentially enjoy the attention; being in that space simply isn't worth the risk. And personally, I would rather not attend a strip club without her.

But. If one of my closest friends finds joy in regularly attending, then I want to join him (just once) and be in that space. I want to be his boy. Lacy laughed when I told her my idea for hanging out with Michael. She waved me off with a laugh, ""Yea. Of course. Go and have fun. And send me some of those terrible memes Michael is always talking about.""

I reached out to Michael and told him I would love to have a boys-night, just the two of us. He asked if we wanted to do dinner somewhere, and I told him I’d rather do something he really enjoys on the town: the strip club. I volunteered a ride and a open bar tab.

""Figured we could vibe for a couple hours, talk, and enjoy the company of the lovely women there."" I said, ready to dive into a world I haven't seen in ages.

""I don't know, I suppose that could be fun,"" he replied His personality is one to minimize things, but I could hear an eagerness in his voice; he was grateful for the offer and company. ""Alright man, let's do this."" A quick trip to the bank and I was ready (never mind the laughs and winks from the bank manager, ""Wait. How many ones and twenties??""). This would be a night to remember!

——— Part Two, The Club

Queue Friday night.

We arrive around seven. From my understanding of strip clubs in popular media, this one is relatively moderate in size. Three stages, enough tables for fifty to seventy-five people. And perhaps thirty people could fit around the bar. It's dark inside. Neon lights dance across the room. Maybe 15 patrons dart along the bar and various tables, and only two or three sit around the stage. I take note at the quantity of dancers, which, to my judgement, was out-numbering the patrons. Michael says, ""Coming before peak hours is the way to go. No one really comes this early and all the girls show up to get ready for the late weekend-night crowd. So it's a nice time to socialize and vibe.""

We grab a rounded booth that faces the stage. Sure enough, one of the dancers immediately comes up and starts talking shit to Michael. She pulls out her phone and shows him a TikTok that made her laugh. They laugh together. I smile seeing him happy. The waitress comes over and I open a tab.

I know what the deal is: The dancers are here to finesse and make money. This is their job. It's truly an art form; it's own version of salesmanship. I'm under no illusion of that fact. I'm just here to have fun, attract some attention, throw money around, and make sure my boy and I have a night to remember. If that means someone finesses me for every dollar withdrawn, then I consider myself a consenting participant.

Our drinks come to the table. I turn to Michael and we cheers. His dancer friend peels off to ""work the regulars"". I reach into one of my jacket pockets and pull out a stack of ones.

""Well. Let's do this, man."" I say, feeling oddly nervous and getting to my feet. I know I'm out of my depth; this experience is one I'm alien to. But I have a confidence about me; this night will be ours.

Leveraging only what I've seen in movies or rapper music videos, I began to tip. Dancer after dancer, I walked over the main stage, laid out a generous amount of bills across the edge-stage railing, and walked back to my seat. The girls would mouth ""Thank you!"", I would smile, nod, and go back to conversation with Michael.

We talked about work, life, his relationships, his family. I learned a lot about Michael that I've missed over the last couple years. The occasional dancer would come by and introduce themselves as they would make their way to the stage; we were indeed starting to make a statement.

One girl came up to the stage. Mixed-race and absolutely gorgeous. She had on an adorable bottom-piece that would look amazing on Lacy... And then, suddenly, I watch as the handful of patrons around the stage stand up, leave the stage, and move to the bar.

Huh. Assholes.

I turn to Michael. ""Man. I wish I could ask where she got those bottoms from. I would buy a pair.""

""Dude. You know you can literally just go ask her.""

""Wait, seriously?"" I replied. Oh. Right. My depth is showing again and I laugh to myself as I renew my confidence. I stand up and move to the stage with another stack. And I stayed there till it was gone. She was glowing.

And then I waved her over.

""Thank you so much! Do you want to take a seat here? I'm Lola (fake name). What's your name?""

""Jason (fake name). No, that's fine."" I said, gleaming. ""But I just have to know where you bought those bottoms from.""

""You trying to buy some for yourself?"" She laughed.

""No."" I laughed along. ""For my wife.""

She then mentioned how she actually didn't know where they were bought from; another girl that works here sold them to her.

""But! She is working tonight. I could ask her and let you know."" Lola exclaimed with a wonderful glow.

""Would you do that for me? I would so appreciate it.""

""For you? Absolutely.""

I headed back to my seat.

And then a dancer comes along and sits next to me. Another next to Michael. The night begins.

——— Part Three, Jaime

She introduces herself; her name is Jaime (fake name). She asks for my name and mentions how I tipped her earlier in the night and she wanted to thank me. Blonde highlights on brunette hair cascaded off her shoulders. Glossed lips pursed in the dancing neon light.

Her smile could poison a Saint. She was in her element. I was feigning at being in mine.

""Jason! That's her! That's the girl who sold me the bottoms!"" Yells Lola from the stage.

I comment to Jaime on how wonderful those bottoms were. She pulls out her phone and opens an Etsy site, showing me exactly where to purchase from. And then we launch into conversation about fashion. Which jumps to discussions on shops in town. To then discussions on where we've traveled. The conversation goes on. She speaks elegantly and with curiosity, and she seems genuinely surprised when I ask her questions back. Her charm and finesse could be a master-class.

She then leans in. ""I would really like to take you back for a private dance."" she whispers as she gives me the club rates. I'm not a huge fan of lap dances. From what I remember of years past, they're always awkward.

I look over at my boy who is talking to another girl and shrug. ""Or how about I just give you that money and we just sit here and talk. I don't want to leave my friend. This is our boys night."" I say genuinely, but still selling my own excuse.

She agreed, although not hiding a slight glance of disappointment. I throw the max rate on the table. Her eyes catch and hold onto mine. I couldn't look away.

We talked. The conversation flowed easily. I lost track of time and my surroundings. All I could see was Jaime. Her hand fell onto mine, resting on my leg. Her lips moved and I drank every word she said. I ask if she would like a drink, and she denies. ""Thank you for offering, but I don't drink at work."" She's focused. Driven. Her hand moved to my leg, and my hand moved to hers. Time became a blurred concept.

Then she checked her phone. ""Oh! I have to go back on stage. I'll see you after?""

""Yea. Please.""

""Okay."" she said through another smile.

I look back over at my boy who looks at me and we both laugh. We both let out whoops with smiles like Christmas morning. Hours had flown by. The bar was packed. And our table was becoming a highlight for the dancers. Names were flying around, and I was trying my best to balance a conversation between multiple people and Michael.

Suddenly, I realized another girl was sitting next to me, taking the spot that Jaime was in. She introduces herself and launches into conversation. Within minutes, I lose interest in her. Not to be rude, I tip and immediately forget her name. She tries to talk to me but my mind is elsewhere; I watch Jaime approaching the stage. My arms are crossed, my body language is closed. I catch her looking over, surely seeing her seat taken, but noticing that I'm watching her. The edges of her lips hide a smile.

*I see you.*

I turn to the dancer next to me, thinking of the perfect excuse to ensure the seat next to me was available again. ""Ah! I'm sorry! I need to head to the stage real quick. This is my girl; I have do my job!"" The dancer moves and I walked to the stage.

Jaime danced. I poured money in. Denomination was of no concern. I was her whale and she speared me.

I turned around to notice the dancer had moved over to a spot closer to Michael. Good. I took back my seat and joined the conversation until a tap on my shoulder.

Jaime.

""This seat taken?"" She points down. I scoot over and she sits next to me. ""Oh. This works too. I was talking about your lap though.""

*God help me.*

We dive back into conversation. One subject gives way effortlessly to the next. And then the subject of dating comes up. She mentions 'What's Your Price'.

""Oh! I know of the site! I haven't used it myself but I'm in some communities that talk about it."" I exclaimed.

""Oh? How is it that you know?""

""Well, I actually sugar.""

""Wait. You're a Sugar Daddy?""

""Yea. My wife and I sugar together.""

""She's your Sugar Baby?""

""No."" I laugh. ""She's a Sugar Momma. And we sugar together. I think the term is Glucose Guardians.""

We launch into conversation about the sugar world. Jaime asks questions about Lacy. I talk about our beautiful marriage and how we began our sugar journey. She probes with curiosity about our experiences, and I divulge how much we've learned over the last year; how we made a ton of mistakes early on. Jaime brings up that she was a sugar baby once, and discusses some struggles she had with that arrangement. She shares her vulnerability, her anxiety, during parts of that arrangement. The parts that she felt out of control and did not appreciate. Then, she shows me her 'What's Your Price' profile. She flicks through some guys and shows me how to send offers. She's honest. Candid. Her life and work scroll across the screen of her phone.

""Yea. Some guys just want to pay to take me to a nice dinner,"" she explains. ""I don't mind. It supplements my income.""

""Yea! No joke. Do you have a Seeking profile?"" I ask.

""I've considered getting one; my friends talk about it.""

""Do you want to see what it's like.""

I pull out my phone, flip open the app, and hand her my phone. She scrolls through profiles of some of the sugar babies before taking note of the unread message count.

""You must be popular!""

I laugh. ""I don't know about that. We're just looking for something really specific, and we're taking our time trying to find the right match.""

Jaime pauses. For the first time in the hours that we've conversed. Dead air.

She looks at me.

""Can I read your profile?""

""Sure."" I stammer. ""Are you sure? It's long and embarrassing.""

""If it's okay, I do want to read it.""

""Okay.""

And then she sat there for a couple minutes and read through the whole thing. Occasionally tapping on the screen and saying, ""Yes. I totally agree."" under her breath. ""Wow. I've never read a profile like this. You put mine to shame. I'm going to have to take some ideas from you."" [shout-out to /u/nsfwhouston: Thank you for the profile review last month. You're a King.]

""Thanks."" I blush.

A sincere smile now plays across her lips. ""I'm sure you'll find her, you know. What you are looking for is not what most people would think of in Sugar. You guys are unicorns.""

I laugh. ""Thank you. The support means a lot. And honestly, the community has been really kind throughout our journey. And we're okay being patient.""

The conversation continues. It's different though, something changed. Her hand plays on my thigh. A weight presses behind her words. Something is on her mind. The conversation goes to previous relationships, what we appreciate about others, more questions about Lacy, and our goals in life. Jaime is indeed driven; she just opened a Roth IRA. She's in college and talks about her degree, and how dancing is part of the plan to ensure she exits college in a financially stable way. We talk about that for a moment before another pause.

A weight hangs between us.

She let's it out.

""You know. If you don't mind me saying, I would be willing to explore that space with you and Lacy.""

I recoil. I didn't come into this club expecting someone to say those words. My mind races. Did Jaime just ask what I think she did? ""Wait. I'm sorry... Are you sure?""

""Yes. I would love to have dinner with you two and talk. Can I give you my number?"" I hand her my phone. She laughs. ""Guess you know my real name now.""

I take my phone back and there it is.

I'm baffled. Shocked. My world feels displaced. What just happened? We dive back into conversation and every concept of my place in this club is dissolved. She wasn't just giving a master-class of finesse, she was the Queen. She found a line I didn't consider and shoved me across it. She found my heart, my vulnerability. I no longer understood whether she was truly interested in us or about to empty every card in my wallet.

And I didn't care.

She points over across the booth. ""Looks like your friend went out for a smoke break.""

She leans in. Her lips an inch from mine. Her hand presses into my thigh. Any thought in my mind drains. The music hits. The lights flash. Is she trying to kiss me? Did I just purse my lips?

She slides her cheek along mine and whispers into my ear. ""I'm not trying to kiss you, silly. I'm trying to whisper.""

I'm utterly transparent. A complete fool.

""About that private room?"" She gives me the rates again.

My mind snaps back. Okay. She wants her sell, which surely benefits her in some way with the club. Phew. I understand. But my excuse for not going into the back is gone.

I let out a small laugh and a sigh. ""Is that what you want?""

""Yes. I would really like that.""

""Then, let's go.""

She leads me to the back, handing part of the rate to the bar as we pass. She sits me down and begins. I stare into her eyes. She stares into mine. She dances and asks what love languages Lacy and I have. She presses against me as I inquire about hers: Time Spent and Acts of Service. We share what turns us on, what we find meaningful in relationships, and how we enjoy being touched. Each time she asks about Lacy as well. The music heightens and she presses her cheek against mine, her breath dances over my ear. I press my cheek back into hers.

""Ah! I have to go back on stage soon. But thank you. I really enjoyed that.""

*Me too.*

I head back to the booth. My friend comes back and we both just laugh. It's been over six hours now.

But he is stumbling drunk. And fading fast. It's time to get out of here and go get some food.

Jaime takes the stage.

This woman made my night. Regardless of whether it was all for the bag, or if she found something genuinely interesting in my character, she was a titan. A warrior. And I was beside myself with how impressing she was.

But. It's time for me to have the last say.

She dances. And I take every bill I have left and start walking around the stage, skipping over patrons, and placing money along the end of the stage. Coating the entire thing like I was painting a warning stripe on the edge. I didn't stop. I didn't look up. I dance to the music, mouth lyrics I don't actually know, and place more money. Until my pockets are empty and the stripe is relatively complete.

I look up. Eyes from all across the club watch me. Michael is on the other side of the bar; him and his dancer friend are nearly in tears laughing at the spectacle as they close out my tab. Jaime is watching me.

I smile at her, head back to the booth, and focus my attention on Michael. He is saying goodnight to one of his friends and we chat lightly for a little.

I turn back to see Jaime sliding her hand along the railing, gathering up the money. Some falls to the floor outside the stage. People just stand around and watch.

*That's rude.*

I walk over and gather the spilled bills off the ground for her. Handing it over onto the stage.

She stops and just stares at me with an expression of genuine thankfulness. ""Thank you.""

""No. Thank you."" I reply.

After a minute she comes around the stage. She sees my jacket on; I'm leaving. But she stops me and wraps her arms around my waist. I place my hands on her hips.

""Oh! You're going? Are you okay to drive?""

""Oh yea. I stopped drinking a couple hours ago. I think we're off to Denny's to get some food in my boy.""

""You really made my night.""

""You made mine.""

""I'll text you.""

""Right. Okay. Good night, Jaime.""

——— Part Four, Conclusion

Michael and I then spent the next two hours laughing and hollering inside an empty Denny's. I throw myself back into a both, leg on the seat like a Greaser in a 1950's diner. We shared our own perspectives and stories from the night; apparently he had on a dancer's bra at one point. We were both over-the-moon at the experience.

Of course we knew these girls were doing their jobs. Even Jaime. For all I knew, it was safe to assume that she didn't give me her actual number, or her actual name. She may have just been playing a part for what was a deer in a snare. But I was so tickled and pleased with being in that space.

I sat across from Michael, watching him happily talk with a mouth full of hash browns. That was the true prize. I know I did right by my friend.

The next morning I sipped coffee while sharing every detail about the night to Lacy. For hours we talked. Lacy was flabbergasted at the conversations with Jaime, at the situation, at the fact that I had met someone 'in the wild'. And we both wondered about the phone number....

*buzz buzz*

A text message.

Jaime.

——— END

What a night. I'm still feeling high from the experience.

And Lacy and I now do have a proper meet-and-greet set up with Jaime for mid-week.

Not sure what will come of that, but maybe we'll post an update.

What Jesus teaches about Servanthood in the church

Introduction
------------

Have you ever felt the powerful call of servanthood in your heart? In a world focused on leadership, status, and self-promotion, the concept of servanthood can seem counterintuitive. Yet, it’s in this humble role that Jesus invites us to experience true greatness. The beauty of servanthood is that it allows us to shine our light by putting others first, reflecting the very heart of Christ.

As we journey through the teachings of Jesus on servanthood, let us open our hearts to receive timeless truths that can transform our lives and our communities. Imagine the ripple effect, as we each choose to serve one another with humility and love. Not only do we honor God, but we also create a culture of kindness and compassion that speaks louder than words.

Bible Verse
-----------

Matthew 20:26-28 (NIV): “Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be your slave—just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”

Meaning
-------

In this Bible verse, Jesus turns the world’s view of greatness on its head. Instead of seeking power and prestige, He invites His followers to seek the kingdom path of humble service. Jesus Himself, the ultimate leader and Savior, set the precedent by not demanding service from others but by serving them—even at the cost of His own life.

Understanding Jesus’ teaching on servanthood calls us to shift our perspective. It’s not about what others can do for us, but how we can serve others in love and truth. Jesus showed us that servanthood is not a position of weakness but of strength, reflecting godly character.

Servanthood in the church becomes our love language to those around us. It means meeting needs wherever we find them, extending a helping hand, and doing so with joy. In living this way, we embody Christ’s sacrificial love, drawing others to Him through our actions.

As we serve, we dismantle barriers and build up the body of Christ in unity. The church becomes a thriving community when it’s filled with people willing to put each other first, just as Jesus taught.

Actions to Take
---------------

– Look for small opportunities to serve someone in your church, like volunteering to help set up for an event or sending an encouraging note to someone in need.

– Commit to praying for others and asking God to show you ways to bless them through acts of service.

[Originally posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarBABYonlyforum/comments/19arq0s/storytime_the_snake_oil_salesman/) in r/sugarbabyonlyforum on 1/1924

I recently went on a date with an older German man from Tinder. He had his age hidden (therefore paying for the app) and in person claimed to be 57 but I think he’s early to mid 60s+). He is one of those sport addict types -in good shape overall with a little bit of a beer belly. Not particularly handsome, more ‘very well-groomed’ than anything.

He was very straightforward and asked me out to dinner. For reference: my profile pics are all discreetly expensive / me looking basic but bougie (no skin) and face hidden. It is clear what I am there for.

The dinner invite was a good start because I love men who make swift judgments and go for what they want - unlike these coffee types that need to try you in 69 different positions (pun intended) before they will even take you to Sephora!

I agreed to dinner, but mentioned my car troubles (genuinely so actually) and he promptly offered to send a car to pick me up. Most importantly, he assured me that the car would return me off home after dinner. I provide an address a block away just in case he turns out to be a stalker.

I get dressed to the nines and we are off to a good start with premium range luxury sedan pick up. Sidenote: Uber black is still the bare minimum though. He just gets point because the bar is so low that some of these slugs want you to drive 40 minutes across town to meet for coffee.

Cut to dinner: 5 star top 10 in the country + globally acclaimed chef type of place. No expense spared, it was the full 15 course delight with the premium wine pairings and almost every extra available. Dinner came to about $1.5k. This will sound snobby but a decade in the bowl means I am accustomed to high end restaurants in the same range so it’s just great that we are on the same page at this point.

I quite liked one particular one wine and he got the Sommelier to sell it to him for $500 and gifted it to me. For reference, he is from 1st world country and we are in 3rd world country so that price was bordering on obscene. In as much as I have had my fair share of fine dining, I admit that no date has ever bought me a bottle of champagne. Their logic is always that the restaurant upcharge is too much. They usually buy it at the store and then serve it to me at their homes or gift it to me based on the wine store selling price. So, him buying me an expensive bottle in a restaurant to take home definitely made an impression because it exceeded the cost of restaurant champagne in the first place.

That being said: $500 in cash would have been preferred.

Now, you may recall that he had assured me that he would ensure my safe return trip home. However, it sort of logistically it made sense to drop him off and then me. Where I am, you can only order 1 Uber car per phone/account and we both needed an Uber to get home. He lived closer to the restaurant. That being said, that is still an excuse on his part because past dates have handed me the cash and asked if I can order my own Uber on my own app.

Of course once we arrive at his drop off, he wants me to come in for a drink. He’s been unexpectedly handsy the entire 5 minute car ride and I know what he is playing for. To be honest, I also sense the markings of a high functioning alcoholic and potential coke habit because he was very composed at the start of dinner..In fact, he did not initially want a pairing for himself (citing a sports commitment early the next day- which was true)…But by mid-course he was sort of struggling to stay composed and was starting to make inappropriate ‘jokes’ about cocaine and such.

Anyway, it’s obvious to me that he’s splurged on the bottle and is hoping to get laid for an unsolicited $500 wine coupon. His place is in a safe upmarket area and my gut is not detecting any danger from him. If anything, it’s part of my ‘research’ because I want to poke around and see how he lives. I am role playing 'Maria' from Ho Tactics and having fun so far in the evening.

Once inside, he offers me a drink (impressively non-alcoholic) and we end up making out pretty heavily. Full enthusiastic consent on my side. I am playing for the Lovebomb angle and intending to go cold the next day because I can already sense that he is the ‘I want to believe that this is love at first sight’ type of Sucrose zaddy- much moreso because we met on a 'vanilla' site and this sort of ‘spontaneous’ lustful tryst helps to sell the romance movie fantasy. *rolls eyes

Furthermore (we may differ here) but, having established that my gut ruled out the risk of serious assault, this little encounter also gave me a change to gauge his character re consent and boundaries. After all, I do not plan to sleep with him or let him touch me beyond mid-thigh and arms. How wil he react to being told no? Disclaimer: I am not proposing you adopt this risky strategy because some men will turn violent. Anyway, he stopped when I said stop and he definitely gets points for that because can’t say the same for most men.

I say I’d like to go home and he gets on it right away: Puts my coat and my shoes on for me, calls an Uber and walks me out. I did notice that he did not open the car door for me as he had before. In fact, he addressed the Uber driver and then walked off back to his front door…before realising his oopsie and running back to close the door I had then opened for myself and apologising to me.

The thing is…it wasn’t a genuine mistake. You would have to have been there to understand it but it’s more a case of a man who has studied ‘psychology/class etiquette’ and has learnt chivalry. He was not raised around it and it is not second nature to him. That sort of thing is a ‘language’ to men who grow up with it. It’s second nature. They rarely forget to pull a lady’s chair for her etc. So, I could smell he was putting on an act as the ‘Quintessential gentleman’ and playing the ‘longer’ game.

Herewith the red flags:

Unprompted at dinner, he ‘casually’ mentioned his alleged ex. By name. And identified her as an employee of his company. He has told me where he works so I was able to look her up after dinner. He mentioned that she was very young (I didn’t ask?).. and that they just had this DYNAMITE connection and everything was great until it wasn’t. And apparently she popped up with a BF soon after. LOL. My take is that she probably realised it was only ever going to be ‘fancy dinner and a romp’ type of situation. If it was a genuine thing, then he’s preying on young women/abusing his power as a Boss- only to waste their time without any commitment or marriage and she left likely for something real. He was also trying to ‘subtly’ position himself as desirable to younger women. Cute.

Unprompted, he further ‘casually’ mentioned a tinder date who matched with him and asked him to take her shopping. He expressed shock and disgust at her ask. My takeaway is that on the one hand, this was probably an inexperienced TikTok SB trying to rinse from the get go. That being said: why did he think it necessary to mention this to me? I think he’s not stupid. He knows what ‘type of girl I am’ - simply from the way I was dressed. Translation: I better not ask him to take me shopping – even though he marvelled at my gorgeous outfit and designer heels I had worn that night (gifted from previous SD).

Mentions how he managed to close a major client business deal by hooking the client's kid up with an apprentice at a major global company group he had worked for in his young days (turned out to be the Mariott group). This came off very ‘dick swingy’ slash ‘I can make life happen for you baybay!!’ It is the classic fake mentorship carrot dangling. It reeked of the same manipulative psychology employed by pimps and dodgy Hollywood model talent scouts/agents.

Mentions how he rejects lunch/dinner invites from certain clients because he can tell that they would not otherwise interact with him were it not for his company role (Managing Director). Of all the red flags, this is the biggest and brightest one because it speaks to the core insecurity of these new money red-pill (on some level) guys who want sugar without paying for it. Nothing wrong with new money. But it’s more about the poverty mentality in this case. Without saying it, he basically gave it away that he grew up in a lower class and his lifestyle now is something he worked up to. And he noticed how his treatment from society changed as he became a man of more means/stature. This type deeply resents the newfound attention/treatment that they get from young women at the cost of ponying up lavish dinner dates and then some. Their fantasy is 22y old Meghan Fox chasing after them with no expectations.

The following day he calls me (green flag), however, he then casually mentions the wine ‘gift’ and declares that it is actually my birthday present. For reference: my birthday is almost 6 months away. Sir? Excuse me?

It looks to me like he sobered up in the morning and realised that he paid $500 for a bottle that actually costs only $200 bottle and now has buyer’s remorse. What OFFENDS me is that he had the pleasure of making out with me- only to wake up and decide ….it wasn’t worth it the $500 of wine that he is going to write off as a business client dinner tax expense anyway?

Don’t get me wrong: I actually enjoyed the hanky panky. BUT it rubs me up wrong that I indulged him and now he wants to turn around and bargain.

At this point (24h later), I realise that this is not an SD on any level. Certainly not allowance based – nor PPM. When he made the shopping comment at dinner, I knew that he also wasn’t a ‘gift’ kind of guy. That being said, I am at a stage where I am quite keen to try some adrenaline adventures so I figured he could be my ‘free activities pass Trick daddy.’

I want to do things like SkyDiving, charter a helicopter, boat etc and not keen to spend my own money doing it. I am thinking he can be daytime fun activities guy. Platonic. I can also build up some extra high end pics for my persona and have fun doing so.

Fast forward, he’s really keen to see me again and blowing my phone up asking me out for dinner again. I am actually genuinely busy so I tell him “sure, but later.” He keeps blowing up my phone with pics of him eating alone and I quickly realise that he is incredibly lonely and in desperate search for a ‘dinner companion.’ After all he is miles away from his own country and friends are few and far between anyway at that age- most are usually busy with their own wives/families etc...or have passed away.

I make it clear that I am not keen to play arm candy at endless dinners that he won’t even provide outfits for - but if he is game to do the activities I mentioned above then we can definitely hang out.

Spoiler alert: he has been blocked and yo girl did not even get a $5 Walmart gift card 😂.

++++++++

TL;DR: Typical 'rich' dude uses his $ and 'success' as bait- but is ultimately not prepared to be of direct benefit and wants free arm candy on his terms. Delulu to the max.",1,1744811397.0,sugarstories,0,1.0,False

Background: I'm a mid-40s Asian guy who has been in the SR lifestyle for the last ten years, on and off, after my first marriage. I've had a track record of successful arrangements, including a few long-term (15 months, two years & 2.5 years) and a few short ones, such as a memorable two months of a summer fling with a college student. I'm in a smaller state between two major cities (100 miles from where I live), so major SBs are usually played in the cities. I'm financially doing fine.

My last long-term SB of 32 months got her master's and became a teacher three states away. I was off the lifestyle for a while, busy with life and work. Finally got back on seeking in last summer and had a few M&Gs and 'trial runs.’ I had few 'rinsing' experiences but had a good success rate in turning M&G into a 'trial run.' (a.k.a. PPM). However, due to very NSFW turn-offs, all those PPMs never became an allowance and did not last longer than a few weeks. My allowance/PPM is above average in my state. And slightly below average for neighboring metro cities based on the SLF master sheet. I can certainly afford to match major cities' allowance, but I don't want to travel 2+ hours one way for meet-ups. I also usually do a couple of PPMs/Weeks allowance worth of gifts (Apple watch, iPhone, Cash, Gift cards for UBER/Saks) every other month or so. I'm not close to a Whale by any means. Still, I always send Uber/gas station gift cards before M&G, and I gradually increase PPM silently, as well as pay for other stuff (SBs’ airplane ticket/Amtrack ticket for family visit and such). So, I'm being 'casually generous' if there's such a thing.

Now, the story I want to tell.

I had my first M&G with this 28-year-old SB around last Thanksgiving. She had just created an SA profile a few days prior, and when I messaged her, she moved to text and wanted to set up M&G quickly, but she had a job interview coming up on the day of the scheduled M&G, so it had to be pushed for few more days. At M&G at the coffee shop, she was more on the edge of things. I sent her a lyft gift card prior since she texted me that she might be late due to an unpredictable bus schedule. I gave her about half of the average PPM in the area this time as a gift. She said she had SDs before, but it was only a while ago. She was a manager at a clothing store before, but the store closed after COVID. She’s applying to grad school and applying for a job at a department store as a personal shopper. She wasn’t familiar with many SR terms, so I gave her a link to the SLF subreddit and explained the master sheet and whatnot. I suggest to circle back after the holidays. She said it would work for her since she would know about her job and the hours after the holiday.

When I returned after Thanksgiving, I reconnected with her. Over text, she suggested low-mid $xxx for PPM, and I texted her back, that’s too low for who you are, and offered 30% more. She was gladly accepted. Then (In hindsight, I should have known), she asked me if she could get half of PPM first since her dog chewed her roommate’s shoes, so she needed to replace them. Since I had a good feeling about this lady, I was like, ‘A few hundred bucks wouldn’t make any difference.’ I sent her a little bit more than half of my PPM over Venmo. This time, we met at the local restaurant for lunch. She ordered cocktails, and we conversed pleasantly about pop culture and books. I expected an hour of lunch, but it lasted three hours.  In the end, I showed my STD test results, and she got one scheduled. We decided to meet for a date a few days later.

We met for lunch on the day of the first date (with intimacy). We talked about many things, and she looked a bit anxious. When we headed to the hotel, she asked me if she could smoke some. She smoked three cigarettes before heading to the hotel. I told her we don’t have to be intimate today. I’m more than happy just to spend the time to be familiar with each other. (I always give PPM in a white envelope or with a gift card within 2 minutes of meeting for the date. Also, she showed me her STD test result while eating lunch.) When we got to the room, I hugged her and reminded her that we could just talk if she were uncomfortable. We ended up talking a little bit on the bed. One thing left to another; she jumped on me in full swing. We talked about using condoms for the first few intimacies, but she initiated raw dogging. I stopped for a second and asked about condoms. She yelled, “I don’t care. I want you now!” 

It was beautiful and passionate sex. However, she looked a bit anxious again once the intimacy was over. I’m huge on aftercare when it comes to intimacy, but she cited that her young dog (2.5 yrs old) keeps barking, and her roommate is texting her constantly. She needed to head home right away. I took her home, and she gladly let me know where she lived. We set the schedule for the next date and kiss goodbye.

A week has passed. We met for another date. Lunch was delightful, but during lunch, she texted her friends and explained that her friends were going to Mexico for a bachelorette trip, but she couldn’t afford to go. I asked her how much she needed for the journey. It was low $x,xxx. I asked her, “Should I pay for that trip?” and she said, “If you want!” I picked up my phone and Venmo’d that amount. She was so happy and texted her friends immediately so she could go on that trip. I also suggested that since I had a weekend free in a few weeks, let’s spend the weekend in NYC being a tourist. She said she wanted to see this musical. So I got a couple of $500 musical tickets (3rd-row center from the stage).

I was traveling a lot for the end of the year. So I couldn’t meet her for a couple of weeks. We texted each other once in a few days. Then, just before xmas, I got a text again asking for a ‘loan’ of a few hundred bucks (not even half of PPM) because her paycheck couldn’t cover all the bills and whatnot. I sent her 25% more than she asked with the comment, “Merry Christmas!” I told her not to worry about paying back.  We planned to meet right after New Year's, but her comm became sparse. But she came back online after New Year's and changed the date/time at the last minute a few times but finally met again. She texted me just before the date that her period had just started. I texted her back, saying I didn’t care much. She showed up for lunch. We had a great time. Then, again wanted to leave as soon as intimacy was over. This time, her dog needs surgery, and she needs to head home to look after her dog.

That evening, I got another text. She suggested that if she gets advanced for the next few PPMs in order to pay for her dog’s surgery. I asked her if I could pay them directly. She said she couldn’t since it was connected to her payment plan. It was low $x,xxx, which is about 2.5 times our PPM. I Venmo’d her again- 20% more than what she asked. Since we had the weekend in NYC planned, I figured that spending the whole weekend would deserve about the same amount for this. 

So, the weekend of our planned NYC trip came up. She first asked me to pick her up from her work right after, which was about 2 p.m. Then, around noon, she texted me that she had a COVID scare at work. I was waiting around her work, and then she texted me around 3 p.m. that she had COVID confirmed by urgent care.

I was still on the fence about her intentions. She was apologetic and asked me what she could do for me. Since I purchased the musical ticket with credit card protection built in, I asked her if she could provide me with test results or a doctor's letter; I would be grateful. Within a few hours, she emailed me a picture of her rapid COVID test with a clock and her driver's license in it. And an urgent care doctor’s note confirming COVID. I also learned that she has lupus. 

For the next two weeks, we were constantly texting. I even sent her a few Uber Eats gift cards so she could order food and groceries. She was complaining about mild lupus flair along with COVID symptoms. 

I got the musical ticket refunded, and we are planning another weekend date over President's Day. At the end of her COVID/Lupus Flair, she asked me for another ‘payday loan’ of a few hundred bucks since she couldn’t work for two weeks. I also sent her 50% more than she requested and asked her to call me. I suggest that once she gets better from COVID, we move on to monthly support rather than PPM. So she shouldn’t feel bad and keep asking me for a loan. She appreciated my gesture and was happy to discuss that.

I even sent a few hundred bucks over Venmo without asking a couple more times. I thought I could trust her since she opened her ID and her place of work, and she didn’t lie (about COVID). At the tail end of her two-week COVID period, she ended up in the hospital due to a lupus flare-up. After a few days, she claimed that she got all better.

Then, the real drama began. 

The day before we were supposed to meet again for a date after her illness, she texted me in panic. Apparently, the roommate she’s subletting her room from was not on the lease or did not own the unit. They both asked to vacate the room that day. After several texts, I cleared the afternoon and went to see her. She was in a panic mood. She told me that all her parents had retired and moved overseas recently. That’s why she moved to this room and looked for SR. She really did have a few stuff in a room with her dog. First, I went to Costco to pick up a dozen big storage bins for her belongings. Then, I asked her if I should pay for dog boarding while she looked for another place to stay. She refused that. So, I reserved a 4-star hotel that accepts dogs (her dog was 55lbs, so I had to find a hotel that accepts up to 75lbs dogs) for a week and a minivan rental for a week. At this point, the hotel costs about a few hundred a night, including tax and animal fees, and another thousand bucks + for a week of minivan rental. Since she claimed she didn’t have money to cover the safety deposit for the rental, I had to sign for the rental van and add her as an additional driver. To be honest, I also had a big SUV that I don’t use daily on my fleet of cars, but I didn’t feel like exposing myself to liability by letting her use the car. 

I calmed her down and asked if she had friends to help pack. I then took her to pick up the rental car and checked her into the hotel. I also gave her a few hundred bucks as petty cash. She and her friends packed all her stuff into a minivan that night. I went down to the hotel the next day and saw that van full of her stuff in the parking lot. I still took her out for lunch. She was optimistic and asked me a bunch of questions about which town she should move to. We went to a different hotel (the usual hotel I use for afternoon dates) for intimacy. She was enthusiastic on the bed. I drove her back to the hotel where she was staying and told her I’d help her any way I could to settle down.

She texted me constantly for the next few days. She wanted to check out of the hotel and then stay with friends or whoever the distance family member was. I told her that since I’m now ‘your man,’ just stay at the hotel and do not inconvenience other people. She appreciated. Then she was working, trying to get her roommate to pay her back for the rent and deposit, and looking for a place to stay. A week flew by. I told her to stay at that hotel for a few more days since it seemed like she could find the place by then. I had to take a short three-day trip to the West Coast during that period. She applied for a few different apartments, but she’s required to have a cosigner. I texted her back that I was not comfortable cosigning.  She replied that she couldn’t ask for that and didn’t even think about it. 

She ended up starting to check out (of her life). One day, she texted me that she wanted to give her dog to her friend and asked her distant relative to hold her stuff for a few days.  The next day, she thinks she should sleep in a car since her relatives can’t hold her stuff or let her stay with them. 

I felt like I didn’t want to be so involved in her spiral. I’d done more than enough at that point.

I suggest she move into extended stay places where she can pay weekly for a few hundred bucks. So she checked out of the hotel I was paying for. I was trying to Venmo her for the extended stay, but she claimed that she didn’t even have money to pay her cell phone bill. (at this point, I sent her almost mid to high $x,xxx over Venmo in the span of 6 weeks, not including hotel and rental car. The total amount of $ I’ve spent is already $xx,xxx) So, I asked her to give me her Zelle. Because it’s bank to bank, the transfer is instant rather than taking a business day for Venmo. I sent her another thousand over Zelle. She moved to a local extended stay place that day.

I came back from the West Coast trip. She promised me that she would move her stuff from the minivan and then return the rental that day. She even asked me for more money for the gas fill-up. She texted me that she was on her way to return the van. Then, radio silence…

Because it was Saturday evening, I couldn’t call the rental place to confirm the van was returned. I tried to check with the rental car company’s main customer service on Sunday, but no one could give me a definite answer. So, on Monday morning, I called the extended stay. When I connected to her room and said Hello, she started mumbling something I could not distinguish. Then she hung up. My gut tells me I’m about to get fucked. I cleared the schedule that day and then drove down to Extended Stay. I found a rented minivan still full of her stuff in the back parking lot. Now, I’m furious. I felt betrayed and used. I tried my best to composure myself.

I asked the front desk to call her room since they never told me which room she stayed in. When I got connected to the room, even before I said hello, she answered, “I’m coming down.” then hung up. A few minutes later, she exited the elevator with her dog in tow. She didn’t even seem surprised to see me. When I followed her outside for her dog to do her thing, I could smell a strong odor of weed. Her pupils were dilated, and she couldn’t see me directly in the eyes. She was definitely out from drugs. I told her I needed the keys to the van. She said she left her key in the room. So I followed her to her room. I didn’t go inside the room, but I could see other people inside through the door. 

Once I got the van's key back, I told her to follow me. I parked my car on the other side of the parking lot and then got into the van. The van was also leek of weed smell and ashes of whatever were everywhere. Her bite-taken munchies were on the floor as well. She kept mumbling that her phone was disconnected due to non-payment and kept showing signs of drug influence. At that point, I got into damage control mode. I bought her a few bottles of Gatorade and water. After a while, she is returning from under the influence. I quickly google searched for the nearest self-storage place. I found one with an available unit. Once we got to the self-storage, she again played the ‘I don’t have any money’ card. I zelled another few hundred bucks to get her storage unit. Then I saw her Zelle notification and glanced at her checking account. She had about two thousand bucks in there. I didn’t say anything.  She moved her stuff out of the minivan almost entirely by herself. A bunch of storage bins, which I got, a TV, a couple of plants, a bunch of dog stuff, etc…

After she was done with the storage move-in, she wanted me to drop her off at the extended stay. I told her I needed her to clean the van while I filled up the gas, and I would return to her extended stay to pick up my car after returning the van. I noticed her phone vibrating during a short drive back to the rental car. She was getting calls and texts OK with her phone. 

After the rental returned, I called a lyft back to the extended stay. She almost didn’t say a word in the car. When we returned to the extended stay, I gave her a few hundred in an envelope and told her that once the dust settled, she would reach back to me. She just nodded and headed back to her room.

A few days later, she texted me asking for twenty bucks to eat something. I didn’t respond. A few weeks later, she sent me a long text for clarity or closure. According to her, it was full of excuses and how much she was scared of losing everything so quickly. She apologized for involving me and finished up saying she was not a bad person. I didn’t respond to that text either.

After all, I probably spent about $xx,xxx in the span of six weeks for four intimate dates. I don’t care about the money itself. It’s not like I’m going bankrupt without it. But the sour taste and the feeling of betrayal remained for a while. It took me a few days on-and-off to type this post. It took me a few months and several therapy sessions to be in this mindset to write about it.  I still have some feelings left towards her. But I don’t think I will ever want to see her again.

So the question remains. Am I The Ass or Idiot who didn’t see the truth? ",1,1744811314.0,sugarstories,0,1.0,False

Who was put on lexapro in the past few days. For background I have been a heavy weed and tobacco smoker, smoking 10-15 bong rips per day all day ( I would smoke both in chops or mokes ). Last Wednesday I decided to go cold turkey on the tobacco and continue to smoke weed as needed for withdrawls. On Friday I felled very good about myself and how I was feeling, but in retrospect it seems like it was more me riding the high of being sober for the first time in years.  Later that night I smoked a third of a joint and went to sleep.

I then wake up an hour late in a full panic and sweat with the most intense depression I’ve ever felt. My friend came over to my place late at night and eventually had to call a 5150 because of suicidal ideation. I spent all three days in the psychiatric ward and was forced to detox off of weed as well. Now that I am my depression has skyrocketed and I feel super alone

Has anyone else dealt with depression like this. I am feeling really hopeless and although I don’t feel suicidal right now I really struggle to find any joy. Also if anyone is in SF and wants to get coffee and just vent to each other I think that would be great.

BUT, for the past few years IAC has been pretty inaccessible to people not from major cities where it is being conducted. I remember the event took place in almost 15-20 cities in 2021 and 2022 and cafes and roasters had the chance to host and bring this event to their city. But now it's limited to maybe 3-4 cities, leaving out all the other brewers of other cities. It's not practical to spend money on travel and stay just to take part in this event, especially for the talented baristas who could literally not afford to participate. I'm sure the participation number has dropped (IAC has not published the number of participants since 2022 on their website, which is kinda fishy). 

Each cafe and coffee partner (city level) pays a sponsorship fee which should be enough to cover costs of judges/organisers travelling to the city. 

Now IAC has even stopped giving the gold, silver and bronze Aeropress to the zonal winners! Another big cut down on budget I assume.   
  
I hope this post reaches the right people, especially the IAC committee, Suhas sir from Benki, etc. IAC should be accessible to the maximum people possible. Limiting it to the elite cities deprives the opportunity for brewers from other towns and maybe also sabotaging India's chances of winning at a global stage just because only a few were given a chance.

Again, I believe IAC is great great initiative, could be even better if the committee decide to take the extra burden of getting more people involved. Peace ✌️ ",1,1744811213.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

1k0kqt1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheApprentice/comments/1k0kqt1/my_opinion_on_all_of_the_candidates_this_year/,My opinion on all of the candidates this year,"# Amber-Rose Badrudin - Honestly, couldn't stand her at first, thought she was all about causing and feeding drama.  However, she did grow on me as the series continued.  Saying that, I absolutely do think she went on there for the fame and the social media clout.  Found it pretty odd that she had a successful bubble tea stand in her shop but got rid of it.

# Anisa Khan - Bit of a funny one, Anisa.  Not a great track record in the series, however, I don't think she was to blame for the number of losses in the teams that she was in.  her business idea looks pretty sound and a safe bet.  The praise from Mike about how great her pizzas are at the interview stage was interesting.  A bit of a hider in shadows but a surprisingly strong candidate.  Not unlikeable either.

# Aoibheann Walsh - I don't feel that we saw enough of her.  Likeable character, honest about her own shortcomings.  To be totally honest, I think she went so early because her business idea is something that could probably be easily replicated despite being patented.  A few tweaks to the design and it could probably be mass produced pretty cheaply.  A great idea, but not something I could see LS investing in at any point.

# Carlo Brancati - What a snake.  Didn't like this guy at all from the very beginning.  Wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him and felt he deserved to go a long time before he did.  

# Chisola Chitambala - My absolute favourite candidate this series.  Sad she didn't make it into the final but I can see why, the business idea sounds pretty good but I can't personally see it working, especially if potential investors have to pay a subscription.  I think Chisola has some great ideas and a fab imagination, but I just don't think she has it quite there yet.  She seemed to get on well with the other candidates and seemed very real.  Maybe one of my all time favourite candidates if I am honest.  Almost a shame it is now a business investment, rather than a job.

# Dean Franklin - Dean... I admit, I wanted to dislike the guy but I just can't! He is a cheeky chappie, you can see he genuinely loves and cares for his family and just comes across as a nice guy who I would enjoy having a few drinks with.  I personally thought the dildo on the AC unit was hilarious, I mean, they were working in a sex shop, you got to have a bit of a giggle whilst you are in there! He has been a bit useless at times, but he never claimed to be good at anything other than Air Conditioning and I respect that.  

# Emma Rothwell - Honestly, I don't remember much of her, I know she was the first to go but she just does not stick in my mind very much.  Just not very good, didn't particularly stand out and her business idea isn't great, it is a pretty saturated market.  No doubt she will do okay with it but it isn't anything ground-breaking.

# Emma Street - This one just felt like a bit of a cardboard cut-out throughout the process.  I didn't feel that she gave very much at all and just got lucky when she was on the winning team. Even when she was fired, she didn't seem to want to recognise or admit her own failings, everything was always someone else's fault.  I just can't get behind someone that can't take ownership when they make mistakes.  As for her business idea, it won't go anywhere.  There are already companies doing really well selling coffees with added benefits, she is too late to the party.

# Frederick Afrifa - Quite a likeable guy but I felt like he had never watched an episode of The Apprentice in his entire life.  Some great enthusiasm but I just felt that he was out of his depth the whole time.  seemed pretty lost as a project manager, I just don't think he had the confidence to lead such big personalities.  

# Dr. Jana Denzel - This guy... He thought he was a lot better than he actually was, having said I've probably been one of the favourites to win the first few episodes and I put a lot of positive contributions there, I just don't feel the need to brag or talk about it in the boardroom as much as others do. If you look at that piece of paper, you've got the numbers there."" No Jana, no.  You haven't got anything to brag about because you just haven't been that good.  I honestly thought he expected LS to beg him to stay in the process when he announced he was quitting.  He knew the task was lost and did not want the humiliation of being fired.

# Jonny Heaver - I liked Jonny.  He came across as a nice guy but The Apprentice needs you to be so much more than that.  He had some big and exciting ideas but I do feel that he let himself get a little carried away with the excitement rather than focusing on the task at hand.  A shame, as he really is a likeable character, but it is a tough process that he just doesn't seem to be cut out for.

# Jordan Dargan - The most overrated of all the boys this series in my opinion.  Absolute pushover, always just bending to other candidates ideas and then making up some story about himself to try to save his skin at the last moment by being sooooo inspirational.  Came across as really false.  I think he lasted way longer than he should have done.  Felt really gross seeing the way Linda Plant flirted with him at the interview stage.  

# Keir Shave - Typical telesales type.  All smarm, no substance.  Selling ticket below cost price AND challenging a customer to a game of rock, paper, scissors really isn't something you want to be doing in a process like this and he was lucky to get further than the first episode because of this.  the fact that he sneakily got his actual business name as his teams name was just outrageous.  Free marketing, that is all that was. As for his business idea, I really don't think it has legs.

# Liam Snellin - I both fairly disliked but felt bad for Liam.  He came across as the kid in the playground that always snitches to the teachers about silly things and puts everyone's backs up, but to not be chosen as PM for a clothing task when he literally has a clothing business was absolutely bonkers! Then to not even be on the design team was a dreadful decision. I do think he took these bad decisions terribly, though, and acted like a petulant child about the whole thing.  Annoying candidate, was glad to see him go, although I think he would have done a much better job as PM on the clothing task.

# Max England - This guy needs to realise that he is no longer a professional tennis player and focus on building his business.  His business idea is actually sound and I think he will be successful with it.  He made some horrible decisions on the shopping channel task and that was ultimately his downfall.  it was almost like he is out of touch with the general public and what we buy.  I don't have very much to say about him as, despite staying in for a while, he didn't really stand out much at all.

# Melica Moshiri - honestly, another one that didn't really stand out much.  She was a bit useless at the best of times but also didn't ever really seem to have the backing of her team.  Sad that she was attacked by online trolls so badly, though, that was unnecessary. 

# Mia Collins - Honestly, the biggest blagger of the bunch and really not likeable at all.  I couldn't stand Mia.  Another one that I would not trust to look after a pet rock.  She comes across as the sort of person that would go behind your back as soon as she has the sniff of a better offer.  She acted like a petulant child when she was fired, huffing about the decision.  She blagged her way through so many tasks and steamrolled her own ideas through.  Granted, she is a good salesperson, but who trusts good salespeople? her business idea is already being done by numerous companies and she doesn't even currently have a business already running ready to expand.  She snaked her way through the series to get as far as she did.

# Nadia Suliaman - I have to give the woman credit for her confidence but she needs to learn to listen to the team around her.  When you have a team working with you, you need to consider their thoughts and ideas, not bulldoze ahead with what you want.  Some shocking decisions made by Nadia, especially considering that the family business is within the food service.  She would have done better if she sat down and thought things through whilst listening to her team.

  
Anyway, it is the final next week, who do you want to see win? What are your thoughts on this years candidates and Sugars decisions? Personally, I would love to see Dean take home the win but I do think that both candidates are worthy and have a decent business idea behind them.

However, I can eat a whole pizza and spicy foods without experiencing the same symptoms. I also take caffeine pills which don't irritate me so I know caffeine isn't the problem. Interestingly, studies suggest that coffee isn't associated with GERD. 

Is there a specific type of coffee bean that could help reduce these symptoms? Would using a paper filter make any difference?

The author calls them “once-weekly solo expedition to do something fun” and explains them like this: “An artist date is a block of time, perhaps two hours weekly, especially set aside and committed to nurturing your creative consciousness, you inner artist. In its most primary form, the artist date is an excursion, a play date that you preplan and defend against interlopers. You do not take anyone on this artist date but you and your inner artist.” (more info [Interview about Artist Dates by J. Cameron](https://lithub.com/looking-to-nurture-your-artistic-self-go-on-an-artist-date/))  
The vibe is playful, intriguing, enchanting, something new or in a different way, reconnect with yourself, self care.

Tinder? Been there. Bumble? Buzzed through. Hinge? Unhinged. Coffee Meets Bagel? I met the coffee, the bagel ghosted me.

I’m a 28 year old electrical engineer by profession so yes, I do know how to fix your appliances and overthink our future together at the same time. I’d like to think I’m a decent guy: career-driven, low-maintenance (unless I haven’t eaten), emotionally available (but will pretend I’m not to keep it cool), and I smell pretty good most days.

It’s not like I’m expecting supermodels or a Netflix-level love story. I just want a genuine connection. But most of the time, I feel like a background character in the dating world, just there, swiping, waiting, hoping… and getting absolutely nothing back.

Is this just a weird phase? A cosmic joke? Or do I need to upload a photo of me holding a fish?

Anyway, thanks for letting me rant. Back to swiping just in case the love of my life is also bored and losing hope at 2AM or maybe I’ll just marry my air fryer. ",1,1744810634.0,gayrelationships,1,1.0,False

[Originally posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarBABYonlyforum/comments/12w7p6j/i_met_up_with_a_billionaire/) in r/sugarbabyonlyforum on 4/23/23

An SD I met on seeking, told me about his cousin overseas (let’s say bill), a billionaire but seriously lonely. Bill and I face-timed a few times before he came to australia.

UPDATE: First date, Bill sent a limo to drive me 1.5 hours to the city to meet him, we went to fancy lunch and I convinced him to get his ear pierced. Went into the city and got it done - He went to buy diamond earrings for himself, and said ‘one for the lady’. They were 23k and HUGE. I politely declined and agreed on the smaller 2k ones (i had to prove i was not greedy) Next we popped into chanel (his idea) and he got me a 10k Chanel bag <33. Met 3 more times since, we still haven’t done anything but kiss. Lots of fancy fancy dinners and limo rides back and forth. Amazing but severely lonely man. Told me he sleeps on the couch in-front of the tv most nights to not feel so alone. That’s all tho - Just some tea for y’all

edit: My biggest dilemma is that he seems like he needs a full relo - I’m a student and can’t commit to him like he needs. Like he is REALLY lonely, I feel he needs someone to move with him and I can’t do that?

edit 2: I was going to end things with Bill (due to severe anxiety) but after this post I think i’ll keep trying. We have a plan to meet on sunday and he said he wants to take me ‘Louie Vuitton and other shops’ So we will see how it goes 🥰

**[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarBABYonlyforum/comments/137c24j/update_to_bill_the_billionare/) 5/3/23**

Went to see him sunday, he took me shopping at louie vuitton and he spent 20k on things! We had a nice coffee, he got himself some perfume. Found a cool Chinese place and stopped there for lunch. We talked about future travel plans together. He wants to take me to europe!

next wednesday seals the deal. Up until now we have only kissed - because both of us are very very very shy. Me, bill, bob and his 2 sb are going for a dinner next week. Where after we are going to have drinks at Bills.

Bob, his sb and I have made a game plan. Bc i’m too shy, SB1 is going to help me, flirt with bill and lead him to his room to .. do things … all three of us. How exciting! She’s super confident and sexy so it’s gonna be good to finally have help breaking the ice’

update - Wednesday has been and gone and boy it did not go to plan. I will make another post abt it 😅

**[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarBABYonlyforum/comments/137c9yz/bill_the_billionare_pt_2_the_real_drama/) 5/3/23** part 2

I met Bobs 2nd sugar baby SB2, and asked - how long have you known each other. She looked at Bill and I and said, oh about a month ago. I went for dinner with bob and bill together. Then she giggles and says, it’s been what, like 7 meets now.

Shookethed. Bill made it sound like he has met her once. - Don’t appreciate this was hidden from me but, alas not a big deal, I love sharing.

side note; my sister also joined us for dinner, she just wanted to meet bill and that’s all.

I talk to SB2 later and ask who she’s here for - bill or bob? she tells me - both, she’s been getting 700 cash per meet. She was told not to tell me but - girls stick together. I’m like ?? slay queen but why is she getting cash and I am not?? I ask Sb1 same thing - she’s also getting cash. But only 200 per dinner. (she’s furious abt this too, it’s so low in comparison)

The threesome doesn’t happen - we tried but bill was acting off and tells bob he’s too tired. That’s fair. Next morning BOB texts my sister, flirting with her saying come to dinner with bill and I for $400!

I’m so confused. Why is everyone getting cash but me? why is my sister now a part of this?? Anyways that’s the tea. I am so greatful for the gifts i’ve gotten don’t get me wrong - but i’m struggling so much. my car broken, i’m only eating chicken noodles I don’t need Vuitton bags I need a new car (they cost the same).

I’ve come to realise - bill is obsessed with buying expensive things for me to wear when with him that HAVE to show their logos. Giving trophy wife. But there’s no cash for me. i’m so confused - why are we all being treated so differently?

note: Please no judgment. There’s things I can’t say bc too many words - I’m just trying to stand up for myself and these other SBs (we are all super friendly and open) I’m open to advice but really just here to provide the tea❤️

**[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarBABYonlyforum/comments/14bneuy/last_update_to_bill_the_billionare/) 6/17/23**

last update to bill the billionare
this is an update to my other posts about my SD, you can see them on my account. (for those confused)

Holy sh*t. Y’all aren’t even ready. I’m so sorry I didn’t give any proper updates for a while. But this is just a conclusion to the story for those still interested.

Long story short Bill passed away today. I am confused, hurt and just overall unsure how to feel.

The whole reason he was in my country was to get health care, checkups and all treatments as where he lives (3rd world country) the health care is not very good. After lots of tests - they found his heart in failure and needed surgery. Over a month after the first surgery, ventilators and more surgeries he passed today.

This was EXTREMELY unexpected, he had an incredible medical team and it was low risk surgery.

Bob (the cousin) had been keeping me up to date through all this as Bill was not awake enough to talk to me - Not the update I wanted to give. Bill is an amazing person, he genuinely cared for my well-being and just wanted to be happy and spend time with me. I hope his family heal. I hope he rests easy.

**Updates from the comments in subsequent days where others were questioning whether this story was real or fiction**

>Ihave already posted it. I don’t exactly owe anyone anything. This isn’t a ‘story’ this is my life with real people who’ve i’ve built relationships with.

>Just googled him and there is an article.

>I cant tell everyone every detail because I need to keep his privacy. Tell me exactly what holes there are, what info is needed for it to seem legit. This is rlly annoying as i sit here and grieve and everyone just believes it’s some story. I’m not being played, there articles up now about his death.

>he’s not Australian. he was visiting Australia for healthcare. I’m not going to try ‘prove this’. Your choice if you wanna believe it or not, but I have no reason to make some story up. I summed up the health experience it was a bit more complex. He would wake up and be stable for a couple days before declining and needing intubation between surgeries. There were moments he was awake for a couple minutes. Maybe his family read my msgs to him. Maybe he was able to check them I don’t know.

>So really he seemed to me he only wanted a relationship which meant it wouldn’t be like a normally SD/SB relo. I accepted this but wasn’t happy as i needed money not things. When i found out he’s been paying for not only one but two girls a PPM cash I was confused bc I was like why did they get this option and not me.  I simply called bob and said my sister wants to meet you, it was already a group dinner (me, bob, bill, sb1, sb2) so he’s like yeah why not and she came along.  I don’t recall saying 50k, we had plans to go to europe / travel and all that. Umm he paid for a hotel for 1.5k a night but I can’t think of anything else near 50k.  I know this whole thing is wild but i really have no reason to lie abt this. Crazy shit just happens sometimes and I happened to be in this.",1,1744810459.0,sugarstories,0,1.0,False

#Northern Lights Spots
___
**Tromsø Island (Tromsøya)**
- [[Prestvannet Lake](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QX3GkH27Mce4Mkmg7?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy)] 25-minute walk uphill from city centre. The surrounding forest blocks city lights, making it a great spot for aurora viewing.  Bus 28 and 40 saves you the walk, get off at Stalheim. Alternatively you can get bus 26 to Myrheim and walk a few hundred meters to the lake. IMPORTANT: Never walk onto the lake without checking ice conditions with locals - what looks solid might not be. Stay on the path that circles the lake.
- [[Telegrafbukta](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ya7j5jw2i8ntzt5r5?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy)] A south-facing seaside spot 25 minutes' walk from the centre. You can follow the coastal path - while scenic, it's not always well marked, and until recently was still under construction. In windy conditions, skip the walk and take bus 34 to Telegrafbukta stop. The beach offers expansive views of the sky and has a few benches.
___
**Spots on Kvaløya Island**
To the west of Tromsø lies Kvaløya, a big island with some great spots. Public transport is more limited than to the spots on Tromsøya. Bus 42 is frequent, but it only allow access to one of the spots, the rest are accessible by 425. 425 is a much less frequent bus, so make sure to plan your excursion based on the time table!
- [Bus 42 Eidkjosen] Get off at the last stop for bus 42 Eidkjosen, walk 10-15 minutes to Kaldfjorden along the pedestrian path. Make sure to follow the foot path, it continues for a couple of kilometres, and you’ll find some nice spots along the way.
- [Bus 42+425 Ersfjordbotn] Drop dead gorgeous fjord, easily rivals Lofoten or any of the more famous spots in Norway, and it’s only 40 minutes from Tromsø centre. It takes a little bit of planning though. Change from 42 to 425 and get off at Ersfjordbotn. From there it’s a short walk to the seaside with dramatic mountain backdrop. Bryggejentene is the only tourist facility here, please stay on public roads or on their property. Locals are justifiably fed up with tourists trespassing.

You said:
Can you role play as a stand up comedian and tell me a long joke

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Grab a seat up front—let’s set the scene. Spotlight’s on, mic check… tap tap… here we go:

""So I recently tried online dating... during a blackout.""

Yeah, I was like, ""You know what? Let me do something spontaneous. Let me look for love while the power’s out."" Real romantic, right? Candlelight, no Wi-Fi, just me, my dying phone, and an app that thought I was still in 2017.

So I open the app—it’s lagging harder than my grandma trying to tell a story. I swipe right on a profile. Her bio says:
“Lover of books, cats, sushi, and long walks on the beach. Must love puns.”
I was like, “Ma’am, I am the pun. Let’s go.”

We match! Boom! First message she sends? “Hey you, are you French? Because Eiffel for you.”
I’m like, oh no. She’s got dad joke energy. I’m in love.

So we chat for hours, and finally agree to meet the next day—coffee shop, neutral ground, no axe murdery vibes.

Next day, I show up, looking sharp. I even wore my “I own three books” cologne—Eau de Library. And then… she walks in.

She looks exactly like her profile picture—which, if you’ve done online dating, is more rare than a unicorn with a LinkedIn profile.

We sit down. We’re vibing. We’re laughing. And then she goes, “Wanna hear a secret?”
I lean in. She says, “I don’t even like sushi. I just say that to weed out the amateurs.”

I’m thinking—this woman is playing psychological warfare with her bio. I respect that. That’s not deception, that’s strategic compatibility filtering. CIA could never.

Then—get this—we’re talking about exes, right? She says, “My ex was into ghosts.” I’m like, “Paranormal activity kind of thing?” She goes, “No. Like... emotionally.” I ask, “You mean distant?”
She says, “No—he ghosted me. Literally. He moved to Bali and became a monk. Didn’t tell anyone.”
I was like, “So… he ghosted you and found inner peace?”
She says, “Yeah. He’s happier now. But I still send him memes.”
What?! Ghosted or not, she’s still maintaining meme diplomacy.

Anyway, we end the date, it’s amazing. We hug. She whispers in my ear, “You're weird. I like that.”

And that’s when I knew…
I just got recruited…
…into the Pun Witness Protection Program.

I haven’t been the same since.
Now I tell this story… under a fake name… at open mics… to strangers like you.
Because love is real.
But so are puns. And they will find you.

Thank you, you've been a weird but beautiful audience. Tip your waiters—and remember: if they say they love long walks on the beach, check the tide chart first.",1,1744810383.0,u_GuitarAdmirable2342,0,1.0,False

Yesterday I sold SPx 5450 calls for $48. Volatility is dropping faster than I can drink my morning coffee. It's like the options market is collapsing - buyers are freaking out and I'm watching closely for the next “Holy Grail” trade on Good Friday

Options trading? It's all about riding the fear/greed roller coaster. Sweet premium? It's basically bottled up panic and FOMO. but the thing is, after every gamma squeeze, it's as hard as waking up with a hangover. I've seen too many traders who try to short and end up losing their money. My advice? Lock up half of your gains in a time-limited cryptocurrency wallet and get ready for the next tsunami of volatility

I will be watching the markets closely today, especially the possible effects of Good Friday  I'm guessing we'll see some new volatility around the holiday, which could be a gold mine for options traders I'll be watching the market movements closely and be ready to take advantage of the right buying/selling opportunities

Options trading requires patience and wisdom. Staying calm and rational during market craziness is key

The biggest lesson I've learned is not to try to predict market tops or bottoms. Go with the flow and adjust your strategy to market changes

Do I move past it or cut ties with him?,"Hi! Throwaway account for obv reasons.



So up until NYE last year I was in a long term relationship with a boyfriend I'd had since university. Things got a bit weird toward the end, and during if I'm honest including an intervention from my family but that's a long story. He lived way up country and so I was very isolated from my friends and family but convinced I was in love etc etc. Around September last year I decided I wanted to reconnect and told him I would be moving down south again with a view to get a job there and he said he would follow eventually.



This meant that for 4 months or so we were basically in a long distance relationship.



Me and my sister get along really well. She still lives at home while going to uni and it's been wonderful to spend so much time with her like the old days. She also has been her usual slightly-bossy-with-love self in helping me out of the dark hole I was in while the old relationship fizzled out and ended.



To this end not long after I moved down she semi-bullied me (again with love) to come to a house party of a friend of hers some time in November last year. This was while I was still technically with my ex. There I met my now crush, let's call him T. We immediately hit it off with flirty teasing, our shared music tastes and whatnot. I was still in a relationship though so didn't let it go any further.



A few weeks later my sister comes to talk to me. She has been chatting with T as well and they were hitting it off (no surprise there, she's lovely!). He'd asked her on a date and she came to me first before answering asking if I was ok with it. I'll admit I felt a jab but she and T were both single and I was still with my ex. I could hardly ""save"" him for myself (even if I was tentatively starting to consider ending my relationship) so I told her this and gave her my blessing. They went out a couple of times but it came to nothing before the end of the year and they remained friends.



So anyway NYE happens, I break up with my ex (at 11pm on the 31st December but that's a whole different story!) and that's that. I'm single again for the first time in almost 4 years. Things have been going well though, I've hit the gym again and lost some weight, had some time to work on myself mentally and I feel in a good place.



Then T asked me out. I went to my sister to talk to her about it and she said it was perfectly fine, she had no residual feelings and she thought I was a better fit for him anyway. She was also keen that I move on from my ex asap (can you tell she never liked him lol) so practically dressed me and pushed me out the door!



The first date went really well. T and I have a lot in common and it's so easy to just chat with him and there were loads of butterflies iykwim. I could feel myself healing from the sh\*t my ex had told me over the years - I AM pretty, I AM interesting, I AM smart, all things that had been slowly verbally beaten out of me. Less than a week later we go out again and things are going really well again. I decide to ask him about the dates with my sister as a way to I dunno address the elephant I guess and he tells me the same as she did - they were nice but they didn't really click in the same way so they both decided to stay friends.



Then he lets slip about how he found it weird that she kept jumping onto his laptop, laughing and saying it felt like she was only seeing him for that. I got confused since I thought they'd just gone on dates for coffee or drinks so I asked him. He sheepishly said something like ""oh that was....in my bedroom."" I was shocked and asked him straight out if they had slept together, and he said yes.



Now I'll admit looking back I over-reacted, basically storming out accusing him of ""working his way through the women in my family"", refusing to see him again and generally making a scene in the pub. He followed me part way home apologising and saying that he wished it had never happened, which made me angrier in my slightly skewed logic coz I then asked him if my sister wasn't good enough and he's now insulting her too. I yelled at him to stop following me and leave me alone, and to his credit he did.



Now it's been a few days since then and I've thought it over a lot, and spoken to my sister. She was upset too, saying she felt horrible but had kept it from me because it was a non-event to her and she didn't want to taint a budding relationship that she fully supported and wanted to see happen. I forgive her ofc, but I'm wondering if I can make myself forgive him. I was so excited on our dates, I saw a different version of myself with him, one that I hadn't seen since uni and want to see more of. He's so kind and generous and sweet, we talked together like we'd known each other for years instead of a few months.



Do I push through and speak to him to see if we can make this work or just cut it off now?



tl;dr - my sister and my crush slept together way before me and him started dating and while I was in another relationship and I don't know if I can get over it, but I kinda want to because he's really nice.",0,1744810158.0,relationship_advice,22,0.29,False

I’m a 30F, 5’2, currently at 232 lbs (started at 260). I’ve done long term keto before without issues, but had to pause my weight loss journey back in 2019 when I got pregnant.

In 2023, I started Wegovy shots and saw great results, but I ended up with gallstones, which led to me getting my gallbladder removed in January 2025. Fun times.

About a month ago, I hit a breaking point and restarted keto. The energy is back, the weight’s coming off, everything should be great… except I’m now dealing with awful diarrhea.

Couple things to note:

• I’m not using artificial sweeteners.

• I’m not drowning everything in grease or butter.

• I have done keto before, this isn’t my first rodeo. 

Here’s a look at my current routine:

• Morning: Inositol drink (Peach Perfect brand) for PCOS support

• Breakfast: Sausage + Chaffles (no syrup, just cooking spray in the waffle iron)

• Lunch: Caesar salad w/ grilled chicken, no croutons

• Dinner: Changes daily. Example: shawarma spiced chicken in a Mission Carb Balance tortilla, with a tablespoon of a mayo/sour cream/spice sauce

I do drink around 3L of water a day and allow myself a Diet Coke as a treat. I’m not a coffee drinker. 

So, what gives? Is it the tortilla? The inositol? Just adjusting post gallbladder? Anyone else go through this and find a solution that didn’t involve living in the bathroom?

Thanks in advance.

Looking for advice, especially from women","I met a girl I already followed on Instagram. We’ve gone out for coffee a couple of times, and both times were short but meaningful. We share a similar sense of humor, we’ve laughed a lot during our meetups, and overall, we’ve had a good time.

She’s also initiated conversations via text, and she often sends me memes that match our shared humor, which I’ve taken as a positive sign. Our chats have generally been engaging and pleasant.

I’ve shown subtle interest—I’ve told her I admire her, that I think she dresses nicely, things like that. I assume she has some idea that I’m attracted to her, even though I haven’t made any bold moves.

Lately, though, I’ve noticed she’s texting a bit less. She still sends memes here and there, but we’re not chatting as much. That’s made me wonder: is she actually interested in getting to know me on a deeper level, or am I just someone she vibes with platonically?

I’m trying to stay level-headed—we don’t know each other deeply yet, and I’m aware this could go either way. But I do think she’s a great person and a potential match, so I’d like a bit more clarity.

That said, I know a lot of guys can relate: it’s hard to tell if a girl is just being friendly and enjoying the connection or if there’s actual romantic interest behind it.

She still reaches out, but mostly through memes now. I’d honestly like to have more meaningful conversations with her and see where things could go.

TL/DR Had my first M&G with a pot and he turned out exactly like yall said he would. Lessons learned: Pay attention to red flags, Discuss hard boundaries like condoms beforehand, and some discussions of financials would have saved me time today.

**Background**

Hello! I have been lurking here on my other account for a while, and have really appreciated the detailed wiki and all the great advice I've gotten from searching and reading threads. I made this account so I could post and share more and maybe have a record of these encounters later to have as a sort of diary and hopefully I can learn more along the way and others can learn from my mistakes and successes!

For some background info I am 33, but look rather young for my age, athletic build, located in Portland, OR (not the most ballin' city for rich dudes, but I know there some here). I tend to have a lot of success in my personal interactions whether its dates or interviews, people tend to really enjoy talking to me (esp older men). On the flipside I think I may be a bit aromantic, I don't catch feelings very often and most of my vanilla relationships have petered out after 3-6 months. I do still like having a romantic/sexual relationship with someone but the expectations the culture puts on vanilla relationship usually leaves me feeling a bit suffocated. I thought for all these reasons that sugar dating could work out well for me, I'm not against dabbling in escorting as well, but I think my company and personality are really the big sell here.

**Experience**

I've done a lot of research (thank you for putting together the wiki) and got my alt phone number, got on seeking and have been carrying on conversations with several pots, some more promising than others. ""Pot P"" seemed pretty eager to meet and was pleasant enough to chat with, but he threw up some red flags early on... asking if I could host (but being ok with several hotel meets first) and seeming pretty eager to get sexy pics without offering any sugar (I just ignored).

I decided to meet up for coffee anyway since he was one of the only pots at this point that seemed pretty keen to meet up. Figured it might be nice to have the first one be low pressure for me since I was pretty sure it wasn't gonna work anyway. We met up, got my next sign this was going nowhere when he had no gift and tipped the baristas only 15% (big turn off for me). We had a pleasant enough time chatting, he seemed very interested and impressed with me compared to other people he's met, he wasn't so unattractive or socially awkward that I couldn't see it working as long as the honey was right, but then we got down to discussing details... Total Salt Daddy from what I have read on here. Wanted $300 PPM and NO CONDOMS, like for real dude? I already do work where I get paid $75-100/hr (its not super consistent, but I also don't have to fuck anyone or get naked for that amount of money). I also am not on hormonal birth control bc I don't think its good for my body and the last partner I had I dated for over a year and we never went unprotected. I told him I wouldn't take lower than $600 and would absolutely never go unprotected, no sir, no chance of that. He told me I'm probably looking for someone in the 250-500k income bracket (like duh, wtf do you think sugaring is bro?). I assured him I was in fact looking for someone in that income bracket and willing to wait if thats what it takes. Date ended quickly but cordially after that, got picked up by a friend, and hoping the next one will be better!

**Lessons Learned**

Here's what I learned but I would love any other input from y'all about what you might have done differently. I think as I get more interest I'll feel a little less scarce/desperate. From my research I've seen that Portland can be a tougher/cheaper market.

~I should have paid attention to the red flags about hotel and hosting and had the money conversation so my time wasn't wasted.

~Should I bring up expectations around protection early? I really don't want to waste my time on someone that thinks they can bareback.

So all in all he was exactly what yall told me he would be and I shouldn't have met him at all, but at least I went in with my hackles up and stood firm with boundaries, and I have you lovely people to thank for that!

**Additional context found in the comments**

So damn grateful!! It honestly felt kind of good to say no and be confident about it. I have some other promising convos going, he was just the first to jump the gun. He told me I was probably looking for someone in the 250 - 500k income range and I told him that was probably correct. I wanted to say no shit dude, what do you think an SD is!?, but I was polite.

Yeah we've always head the ultra-processed food but even they were better back then. I'll give some examples:

Chocolate: we're one of the biggest cocoa exporters, still the regular chocolate in the shelves have become tasteless, greasy and overly sweet. Food that used to contain chocolate are now ""chocolate flavored"" which means actual cocoa paste being replaced with some misterious greasy artificial brown slop.

Coffee: I guess we're the biggest coffee exporters but what we find in the supermarket has become way expensive and lower tiered brands have silently added roasted BARLEY to the package, meaning coffee now is not coffee anymore because it contains barley.

Dairy products: pure shit, pure pure shit. Good condensed milk is being silently replaced as well with some slop that has less fat content meanwhile the actual condensed milk is more expensive. Our cream cheese (requeijão) is now “cheese flavored” or something like that, which means less dairy and more cornstarch or who knows what. Not to mention it all tasting like plastic.

Pretty much every product we used to buy, either okay for daily use or ultraprocessed, is now being stripped of their core (and expected) ingredients like tomato and tomato pulp in a tomato sauce or actual dairy in heavy cream and replaced with some weird artificial glop that probably causes even more stomach and thyroid cancer while we’re paying even more for them.

1k0k8yv,https://www.reddit.com/r/victoria3/comments/1k0k8yv/why_do_we_like_victoria_3_april_2025_first/,"Why do we like Victoria 3? (April 2025, first playthrough)","**Short version:** This game is very good.

I guess 'good' is relative. Let's put it this way: third night in a row of playing it. As I have the week off, the end of the night means 5am.

As a Victoria 2 player here, that recently tried Stellaris and threw it out after 10 hours, to me it's a worthwhile question what kept me playing Victoria 2 for years, why I waited years like everyone else for a sequel, why I have been sitting here playing this game for so long in such a short span of time, and why the vibes of greatness here, the massive improvements of recent years, make me think this is still my dream game.

\-**Playing as the national spirit of a nation:** The malleability of playing as the country, no matter the leader, political system or indeed currently held territory is such a fantastic concept that it bears mentioning. You continue nomatter what. No game over if your country is overthrown by a liberal or reactionary revolt.

It just then encourages you to roleplay.

**-Economics:** Perhaps I am one of the few people (I was also younger then) that never really got the economic management aspects of Victoria 2 and fudged my way through by putting it all on autopilot, I cannot say the same for this one. The game has managed to teach me through its UI where to find and how to follow all of the major dynamics of demand and how it affects your population, allowing this organic tracking of the economic aparatus of your state. And that already would have been fantastic, but it does much more now:

(worth noting, some fixes since last time I played make the game a lot better, such as 0 bureaucracy costs on trade routes with nations with a trade agreement)

My only current issue is that I find it difficult to see what the overall world market prices are for goods, i.e which goods have the best potential for export outside of my market.

**-Macroeconomics:** What I liked about Victoria 2 was tracking and tweaking my budget for my nation. Playing the permanent civil service and government, balancing the books but also knowing when to go into the red. (Admission, I have Morgenröte installed so I don't know whether the Potato blight is part of the base game) When it hit, I knew what measures to take to try and alleviate the burden on the people, even if it meant using up my gold reserves and going into the red for several years.

This game makes this so much better though with extra points to use: Taxes on individual goods at the cost of authority, setting tariff levels, keeping track of government waste.

This keeps me so immersed

**-The POP system and statistics:** This is possibly the most beautiful most engrossing detailed set of features I have seen in a game ever. You can keep close track of your own pops and all sorts of details about them, what their economic situation is, why they might be poor, what prices are weighing them down, their income, their expenses, political outlooks... this is a society!

But it gets better than this when you extrapolate it to the whole world, where you can see Germans in Bohemia, the Jews in Persia. Morocco and the Pale of Settlement, the Native American pops across north america... this is a simulation of the world as it was back then, and it's amazing.

Particularly neurotic players like me check every so often which pops are where, and how society is changing. How my society is changing. (when did these english people arrive in Belgium?)

**-Politics:** (Can't imagine how much better this will be with the Better Politics Mod. Here however is what I like about it in the base game)

IGs are the base of the political system. They are the backbone of political parties and can freely move out and support another one adding to the dynamism of the political system. This is much more in depth than Victoria 2. (And to me, makes Stellaris some rather unfunny joke)

(Lobbies are great concepts for foreign policy, however... why are some of them trying to get me to antagonize nations 10x my size as Belgium? A bit more visualization of which are actually relevant would be useful)

I think however the game still has more of a focus on internal politics (which is great and arguably more important), than international politics which I still think needs more development, more events, more organic interaction, and a better system of notifying you what is going on abroad. Example: I could clearly see the Springtime of the Peoples erupt across the German states, but the game wouldn't start off with an event saying this was happening and setting Europe alight. (Just three events please, one when its happening generally, one when its affecting your country and one when its ended. Didn't Victoria 2 have this? Or was it modded in?)

Either way, even how it is currently, internal politics is much better than in Victoria 2, among the best in a game overall (ok, CK2 and CK3 excluded). Foreign politics I know is going to get better one way or the other. But unlikes Stellaris, a strong base for improvement is here.

**-Warfare:** I've only done 2 here. I am aware of the controversy around this, and possibly it's not worth arguing about as a rework of some kind is going to come sooner or later.

I found the UI for selecting, mobilizing or creating armies to be pretty cumbersome. Here is what I got so far: You can create different armies, assign or create troops formations to them. You mobilize them, preferably just when a diplomatic play has started, then send them to where the front is (and still I found this more cumbersome than necessary as you sometimes can't find where exactly to click on the front). Battle movements are AI controlled. What the game didn't tell me and I found out, was that you can add special provisions and buffs to armies.

Maybe unpopular, but I loved seeing the battlelines, the wooden ramparts, my flag next to the troops (in my case it was a tribal war in Congo). Then seeing the dead and wounded numbers clear on the battle screen. I can't complain about this, I just hope the animations don't always stay the same. I need more experience with this I think.

That the game needs late game Great Wars is a given, and more limited 19th century wars also.

The diplomatic play screen is bit... too much for small conflicts. I wish there was more flavour here depending on who you're fighting. If you're fighting a Major Power vs a non-Western tribe somewhere.

All in all, I liked it as a side feature, especially as a country that is trying to stay out of wars. BUT: I know full well that in larger wars there are likely going to be some illogical outcomes. Army teleporting.... 

**-Relaxing pace:** Another caveat, I have been playing very carefully, as in: lowest speed, 1855 only after nearly 20 hours of play. But: I can do that. I don't need to rush through the game personally to find interesting things to manage or do. I can have this long play session, sitting and admiring the world and current events (I admit though, the Morgenröte mod helps a lot in this regard too).

**-Empire-Building:** Playing as Belgium, I naturally upgraded my laws to allow colonization, and started expanding into the Congo. If you're attentive, you can get quickly how it works. Personally, I found this much more engaging than in Victoria 2 (where you colonized a tile, and waited for a bar to fill). You choose the territory, but gradually expand over several rounds, each time increasing the territory and agrable land, allowing you to build more buildings, in my case, banana and coffee plantations. Furthermore, if you get the pop mechanics, you realize you are getting a lot more local pops who can be employed in those buildings, especially useful if you're facing labour shortages at home.

Then there's the companies that you can found based on those colonial buildings to speed up settlement.

**In closing:** Why do those that like this game, love this game? Because it does things no other game does. Provides the tools of immersively running a nation, society and economy and see how the world changes with it. What for some may be less interesting, is absolutely fascinating for the curious individual who wants as much details as possible.

All I now know is, I'm going to support this game till the end. There's nothing like it.

I will however keep angrily criticising the hell out of bugs and other messups that take me out of my immersion. Stay tuned for screenshots as they happen.

Then there’s my colleague. You know the type: charming in a “forgot to reply to your email but somehow you’re not mad” kind of way. We started having lunch together “accidentally” four times a week. It’s not a big deal. People eat food.

Somehow, those lunches turned into coffee walks. Then inside jokes. Then memes sent at 11:47 p.m. I told myself it’s just work bonding. Work bonding can include late-night texting about the metaphysical implications of free will… right?

The other night, we went to a happy hour with the team. Most people left after two drinks, but we… didn’t. We ended up at a wine bar “just to keep the conversation going.” There was jazz. There was eye contact. At one point, she touched my hand while making a point about the universe being indifferent, and I didn’t flinch. I might’ve leaned in. But scientifically, I was just trying to hear her better. Acoustics. Physics. Totally innocent.

Anyway, we hugged goodbye. One of those long, warm hugs that says “I see your soul and maybe also your collarbone.” Still—no kissing. No confessions. Just vibes and fermented grapes.

I didn’t tell my partner about the wine bar. Or the weirdly poetic eye contact. I did, however, bring home cookies and acted extra interested in their story about printer ink.

1k0k4xt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/comments/1k0k4xt/i_stayed_in_a_hotel_that_was_totally_abandoned/,I stayed in a hotel that was totally abandoned. Now I know why.,"A phone call came in with the sun and found me sleeping in a shitty hotel bed somewhere deep in the buttholes of southern New Jersey. My head hurt like hell, my stomach was about three seconds from turning, and I just wanted to get some rest. But motherfucking Todd couldn’t help himself. The dude was like a corporate wind up doll, born and bred in the basements of corporate America to wake up at the crack of dawn and take everybody’s money.

“It rained last night, right, Mike?” he coughed through a mouthful of menthol lozenges. “I heard water on the roof. And the wind. Jeez. The entire building shook like the devil himself was playing maracas!”

My memory took a few seconds to catch up with the conversation. We’d been driving all day, through the turnpikes and over endless skyline bridges that hovered high above the factories of the Northeast. We didn’t arrive at the dingy little inn until sometime around nine that night. The lights were all off. The lot was dark. It was drizzling, then, at least I thought as much.

“Anyway, I went out for a cup of coffee this morning. The ground was bone dry. I can’t figure out why.”

An old alarm clock buzzed next to a row of empty bottles. The television blared white static. I wasn’t really listening. I couldn’t even find my pants. The room bore all of the typical signs of my personal downfall. A large, empty bag of potato chips was stationed by the refrigerator, with a case of Blue Moon carefully placed beside it. The mattress was soaked with sweat and the sheets were twisted about. It looked like somebody either had an exorcism or got drunk watching reruns of family comedies. Given my history, I settled on the latter.

“That’s not even the weirdest part,” Todd whispered. “Nobody’s here. I checked the halls, the lobby, bathrooms. The entire building is empty. It’s freaky.”

I took the comment with a grain of salt. Todd had a tendency to worry. That was actually putting it mildly. The man was a full-blown panicker. His fear of flying was the sole reason we were forced to drive five-hundred miles across the fuckin’ country, shilling shitty software to worse people who didn't care all along the way. His anxieties weren’t even the worst part, it was the colossal arrogance that drove me up a wall more than anything else. He was one of those guys that seemed to take sadistic pleasure in competition with the GPS. Every wrong turn was a victory in the battle of Todd vs. the technology. That was how we ended up so far off the beaten path. Some people just don't want their tribal knowledge to be lost. 

I bet he could have stuck that quote in his corny little PowerPoint.

“Are you ready yet?” he asked. “Let's go. I don’t like this place very much. Something about it gives me butterflies, and not the fun ones.”

As much as I hated to admit it, he wasn’t totally wrong. We booked the rooms through one of those shady discount travel sites, about an hour ahead of showing up there in the first place. The building seemed modern enough. The parking lot was well lit, and the lobby was decorated with hung plasma TVs and new furniture. But when we made it to the front desk to check in, there wasn’t a single person around to greet us. 

No clerks, no guests, nothing.

Just a single sign-in sheet, a stack of faded brochures, and a rack full of keys labeled in neat, faded handwriting. We grabbed two at random. Todd shuffled toward his room, and I found the minibar in mine. After that, things got hazy.

“Seriously,” he snapped impatiently. “Let’s go. I’ll meet you in the lobby in five minutes.”

I gave it a second before I got out of bed. The nausea eased with a gulp from a plastic water bottle stashed under my pillow. The shower didn’t run, and neither did the sink, so that same bottle came in handy when I needed to brush my teeth. I finished getting ready and hated on myself in the mirror a little bit. I wasn’t the type to drink myself stupid. It was just a transition period. Nothing was bad. Nothing was good. I was just in a rut. At least, that was the excuse.

We met by the checkout desk. Nothing had changed. The lobby was quiet and untouched. Chairs were still perfectly angled around fake plants, and the same stack of brochures sat patiently collecting dust on the counter. I looked around for a bathroom that actually worked, but before I could find it, pretentious sneakers squeaked down the hallway behind me.

""Welcome to scenic White Valley,"" Todd announced in his best radio voice. ""Home of absolutely nobody.""

He looked way too pleased with himself for a Monday morning. His checkered polo was buttoned all the way to his chubby little neckbeard, and he wasn’t wearing a tie or blazer, so it was a rare day off from the prototypical uniform. He struck me as the type of guy to read Business Insider’s column on how to ‘*blend in with your people*’ on the road. I guess the previous day's cuff links just weren’t cutting it. You could almost smell the effort in the form of Draco Noir.

“Are you driving?” he sniffed. “I’m ready to take a nap.”

I looked around for a restroom first. The public one was on the far side of the atrium, past a row of planters and artwork in the form of abstract shapes and buzzwords. I left my bags with the human robot and made my way across the room. The floor was freshly polished, and each step clapped back off the walls with a sharp echo. Inside the bathroom was a single toilet. The tissue dispenser was empty, but the sink still worked. There wasn’t a signal on my phone, and the news was a day old. None of my calls or texts were going through. That didn’t seem out of the ordinary, though. There hadn’t been service for miles.

I finished cleaning up and stepped back out into the atrium. Something was off. Everything looked the same. The same tall windows. The same red paint and manicured furniture. But a detail had shifted. Maybe something in the air. I couldn’t quite tell what. Like the whole room had been rearranged when I wasn’t looking.

I turned a corner.

Then I saw her.

A woman stood beside Todd. She was older looking, with gray streaked white hair that hung past her shoulders, and eyebrows so thick they formed a single line across her brow. Her uniform didn’t match. I don’t know why I noticed that first, but I did. The shirt had one logo and the hat had another. Her pants were too tight, and rolls of stretch mark ridden skin leaned out the side of the gap in between her shirt. 

She didn’t say anything, initially, and that was the creepiest part of it all. She just sort of stared at me. Like she expected something to happen. 

Todd kept just as still. He shot me a quick look before his eyes dropped to the floor. 

“Mike,” he whispered when he talked. I realized then that I had never heard him be quiet about anything.  “I think we better do what this woman asks.”

I pulled the key out of my pocket and set it on the desk.

“Alright. Does she want us to check out?”

No sooner than the words exited my mouth, a sharp screech ripped across the atrium, loud enough to force us to our knees. The tone shifted up and down in frequency. It was piercing one second, then rough the next. I couldn’t figure out where it came from until something dropped behind the front desk.

My attention shifted to the chalkboard.

That’s when I noticed the knife.

“Go,” the woman grunted. “Now.”

She dragged the blade across the board a second time. It was horrible. Todd screamed, but I couldn’t hear his words, I could only see his lips move. We got back up to our feet.

Then she pointed at the front door.

“Go,” she repeated. “Now.”

We got up and walked. The stranger followed.  I didn’t look back at her. I didn’t have to. I could feel her breath hot on my shoulders. Her steps fell into an uneven echo, like her shoes didn't fit, or she hadn’t moved in a while. I glanced over at Todd, and his normally polished eggshell had already begun to crack. Sweat gathered on his collar and soaked through the pits of his polo. His expression looked like the features on his face had frozen somewhere between apology and panic mode.

“Please,” he whispered. “I don't know what we’ve done to offend you. Just let us leave.”

The knife poked gently into my back.

“Go.”

We kept it moving. The double doors led to a courtyard in front of the building. Outside, the garden was decorated with flowers and benches. The smell of fresh mulch felt like freedom. I could see our car in the lot. There was nobody else parked there. I hoped this mystery woman, fucked as she was, would simply let us get in and drive away. Maybe she thought we were trespassing, or whatever, but at least then we could put this whole knife-point encounter behind us. 

We marched in an awkward sort of procession, and after the first hundred steps, I was sure that we were home free. But just as Todd reached into his pocket to find his keys, the blade slashed across my peripheral vision. Fuzzy white dice fell to the ground. Bright red blood followed.

 “Go.”

We walked on. Todd limped beside me. He was quiet, now. We left the parking lot behind after a few hundred feet. The manicured landscaping transitioned into a dirt path between dense trees. The forest was quiet. Branches crisscrossed overhead, low enough that we had to duck in places. The woman stayed behind us.

A hill rose out of the woods with the early morning fog right above it. We reached the crest. 

That was when the Valley opened up in earnest.

“This can’t be real….” Todd mumbled out in front. “Does nobody work in this town?”

A clearing about a mile wide spanned a gap in between the trees. Every inch of it was covered with people. There were parents with kids and folks in uniforms. There were wheelchair-bound patients in hospital gowns and beds with monitors and nurses attached. There were *dozens* of them, maybe hundreds, but not one of them said a thing. 

It was disturbing. They were the quietest group of people I had ever seen. Nobody coughed, nobody whispered, nobody laughed. They didn’t even seem to look at each other. The only sounds were the steady movement of their feet on the dirt and the soft rustle of clothing that brushed together. 

A weather-beaten brown building sat at the center of the clearing. It couldn’t have been taller than a couple of floors, no wider than about a hundred yards. There weren’t any roads that led to it. No walkways either. It looked like somebody had just taken the place and plopped it in the center of the valley.

The structure itself was in rough shape. Vines crawled across the face of the faded red brick. Weeds gathered around the foundation. The roof sagged in the middle, a drainpipe dangled from the side, and the windows were stained to the point where we couldn't see through, even in the daylight.

A sign over the awning read *Library* in chipped white lettering.

The woman pointed ahead, and we hustled down the hill to join the crowd. The group was packed tighter towards the front. The people seemed exhausted, or angry, even. Like the journey had taken everything out of them. Todd tiptoed beside a burly man in pajamas. I fell into line behind a mother and her two young children.

I tried to get them to look at me. The kids, the adults, anybody. I wanted to scream, but I could still feel the knife against my back, and every wrong move felt like it could cut my kidney right out of the fat.

“My daughter expects me to be home tonight,” Todd spoke plainly through the throngs of bodies. “She won’t understand why I’m gone.""

Nobody answered him. The townsfolk were restless by this point. Arms and shoulders pressed up against my back. One lady nearly nicked her hand on the knife. A row of heavy boulders had been laid out to form a path through the field. The formation funneled the people into a tight wedge near the door. But they weren’t moving. It was like they were stuck. The big man in pajamas shoved a gurney aside and forced his way to the front. He slammed on the oak exterior with his fist three times, in rhythm.

The double door swung open.

And then the crowd started to move.

The whole line broke apart. Parents ditched their families. Nurses abandoned their patients. The push from the back didn’t stop. A few people fell down next to the rocks. One of them was an older man with white hair and a gold tee-shirt ripped at the seams. He vanished beneath the weight of rushed footsteps and appeared again, face down in the dirt.

“What are they doing?” I shouted over the chaos to the stranger behind us. “What the hell is this?”

She glanced at me and smiled like it was obvious.

“They’re hungry.”

The crowd rushed into the building like salmon headed upstream to spawn. Dust kicked up behind them. Floorboards creaked under the weight. The stampede was over in about ten seconds.

And then it was quiet.

A handful of people hadn’t made it inside. Some were moving. Some, like the old man, were not. I’ll never forget the look of determination on a teenager with mangled legs and a row of bloodied cuts in his face. He dragged himself toward the door, inch by inch, until a last-minute straggler shoved him back down. His skull hit a rock with a sickening *crack*.

He didn’t move after that.

“Go,” the woman gestured. “Inside.”

We did what she told us. The inside of the library looked like it had been furnished by someone with a very small budget and a fond memory of the year 1997. The walls were pale green and covered in laminated newspaper clippings about science fairs and fundraisers. The chairs were upholstered in faded fabric and arranged around metal tables stacked with old magazines. An empty fish tank sat on a low shelf, but there wasn't any water, just a plastic log and a thin layer of gravel.

“What the heck are we doing here?” Todd spat. “We have a right to know.”

The stranger tilted her knife towards a staircase tucked into the back corner of the room. She seemed more agitated than before. Almost antsy. Her eyes were bloodshot, and she kept scratching her neck until the skin turned red. Her fingernails were peeled and bloodied. There was a look on her face like a crackhead hungry for a fix.

""Go.""

The air got hotter as we climbed. The steps rose above a long and narrow hallway where the mob had already vanished from view. At the top was a plain gray door with the word **Storage** labeled at the top. Our captor fiddled with the lock for a second. Then she poked the broad side of the blade into Todd's back.

“Inside.”

 The room was small and slanted at the edges, almost like a makeshift attic office. A closet took up the far corner. Two narrow windows let in bright sunlight that illuminated a thin strip like tape across the wood paneling. The air smelled of old carpet and moldy paper, combined with something sharp and chemical. 

“Stay here,” the woman shouted. “No leave.”

And with that, the door slammed shut. 

A lock clicked behind it.

Todd paced around the narrow space in tight circles. His breathing got heavy. He swallowed hard and pressed a hand to his chest. He looked like he was about to pass out. For a second, I thought I was going to have to catch him. “We need a way out,” he babbled. “Mike. We can’t stay up here. You understand that, right?”

I didn't say anything back. There had to be something useful in the room. Something we could use to defend ourselves, or help us escape. I tried the windows and they were rusted shut. I pressed my palm into the glass and shoved. Nothing moved. 

“What are we going to do?” The closet was next. A cardboard box sat near the back with a faded Home Depot logo stamped on the side. I pulled it out and crouched to check the contents. Inside was a toolbox that looked like it hadn't been touched in years. A broken level sat beside a pair of pliers with the grip half melted. An old, rusted hammer rested on top. “This will work.” I went back to the closet to take another look. A gap in the floorboards had opened where the toolbox had been. Pale light bled through the cracks. The smell coming off it was stronger than before, and it was thick with chemicals, something like bleach or melted plastic. It stung a little when I breathed it in.

“Do you hear that?”

At first, I thought it was the pipes. But the sound didn’t match anything I’d heard before. It was a rhythmic clicking, in steady, gurgling intervals. Almost like wet lips trying to keep time over a beat. I dropped down to the ground and pressed my eye to the gap in the floorboards. That’s when the room beneath us opened up, and I knew we’d stepped into something we weren’t meant to see.

""What is it?"" Todd snapped. ""What's happening?""

The main hall was massive, but everybody was gathered around the center. A row of pushed-together desks guarded three thick steel drums. A small group of young women in white moved between them in slow, deliberate circles. Each of them dragged long-handled ladles through the surface through pools of translucent orange liquid. The whole crowd watched them work in silence while the concoction bubbled like lava and melted cheese.

""Not sure,"" I muttered. ""Looks like they're lined up for something.""

A figure stepped into view from the furthest queue. I recognized the face. He was the same kid from earlier, the one who cracked his skull on the pavement. Something about the way he moved just seemed wrong. The bones in his legs bent at awkward angles. Each step was like watching a puppet try to figure out its strings. His face was pale and streaked with dried blood, but he didn't seem to mind the cuts and bruises, he just kept going, arms at his side, eyes ahead.

“This is weird,” I muttered out loud. “Now they’re getting ready to eat.""

The teenager shuffled in front of the vats. He seemed to be the first of the townsfolk to be seen by the lunch ladies from hell. They swarmed him in a group. One of them looked him up and down. Another sniffed him by the collarbone. Apparently satisfied with the result, the two of them scurried out of the way, while a third forced the kid down to his knees in front of the bile.

She lifted a utensil to his nose.

She pinched his nostrils.

She waited.

After a moment, a pale white slug forced itself free.

“Oh my God,” I covered my mouth to keep from vomiting. “This is sick.”

The woman caught the thing in her dish before she walked toward a smaller drum at the back of the room. She lowered it inside carefully, like it was made of glass. 

The kid went limp. One of the others stepped in behind him and gently dunked his head into the orange slop.

He screamed when the second slug emerged from the slime.

Then he sobbed as it crawled across his mouth and up his nose.

“They're parasites,” I muddled my words trying to explain. “They're inside of them...”

The kid twitched. His eyes rolled back. For a second, I thought he was about to collapse again. Then his whole body seized. He snapped upright and started laughing. It was a hysterical, panicked, frenzied sort of laughter. The type where you have to catch your breath in between. He bolted across the room and slammed his head into a wall. Then he bounced off and did it again. And again. He dropped to his knees and stared at the blood on his hands. Then he licked them. Slowly. As if he was savoring the taste.

Todd reached around me and pulled the hammer off the toolbox. I couldn’t stop him. Everything happened too fast. There wasn't any time to react. He stepped past me and smacked the window with one clean smash. The glass cracked and blew apart. Shards bounced across the floor.

I was still looking through the crack in the floorboards when the energy shifted. Every head in the hall below snapped toward me. Not toward the window. Not the noise. Me. Like they knew exactly where I was. Like they’d just been waiting for a reason.

And then they started to run.

The teenager was the fastest. He pushed the others out of the way as he dropped to all fours and sprinted to the door at the end of the long hallway. I got up and started to move myself. Todd was trying to force himself out of the window. But he didn’t quite fit. His pants were torn where the jagged pieces bit deep into his legs. His shirt was covered in red. He twisted hard, trying to shove through, but the frame scraped him raw. He yelled back at me as footsteps rushed up the steps. Then he turned around.

There was something evil in his eyes when he hit me.

I slammed into the floor hard. My head bounced against the tile, and everything got slow. My ears rang. My vision pulsed at the edges. I could still hear him moving somewhere above me. Todd. He was angry about something.

The door burst open.

The mob poured in.

The man in pajamas spotted him first. Todd had one foot out the window, but the cuff of his khakis was caught on the radiator. He couldn’t move. The big guy yanked him by the ankle and pulled him back inside. The rest of them screamed like animals. They clawed at his arms and dragged him across the floor. Todd kicked. He begged. He said he was sorry. He said he didn’t mean to. They didn’t care. They hauled him out the door and back down the stairs, still yelling, still pleading for me to come and save him.

And then it was quiet again.

I waited by the door for a few seconds. Just long enough to know they weren't coming back. The screams didn’t stop. They only got worse. Todd’s voice had turned hoarse and jagged, like he swallowed some sandpaper. There weren’t any words to be heard anymore, just guttural moans. The mob loved it. They made these horrible little noises. Snorts. Gasps. Something that almost sounded like applause. They were excited, now. And that horrific fucking clicking sound didn't stop, either. It only got louder.

I stepped through the doorway and into the hall. My legs wobbled. My skull throbbed. The world tilted every few steps, but I didn’t stop. I just walked.

Down the steps.

Through the library.

And out the front door.

For a moment, I felt guilty. I really did. But then I thought about the hammer. And those stupid fucking khakis. And all of the horribly condescending moments that led to the one when that cowardly, selfish little asshole tried to sacrifice *me* so that *he* could survive.

And then I just kept moving.

The woods were cold and dark, then. The early morning had given way to a gentle rain that slipped through the trees and clung to the branches. Mud sucked at my shoes. Branches scratched at my shoulders.

I followed the same path we took in and ended up in the field that led to the parking lot. 

Our car was still parked at the back. I spotted the keys with the little white dice in the gravel where we left them, wet and smeared with blood. I picked them up, unlocked the door, and slid into the driver’s seat. I stared through the windshield for a while.

Then I started the engine and drove away.

That night, I reported everything to the police in my hometown. I felt safer there. I expected they'd ask me more questions, maybe even think I had something to do with it. Maybe I did. I still couldn’t shake the guilt of leaving my coworker behind.

Before long, the secretary returned and told me they had located Todd. They spoke to him on the phone, and he was a little shaken up, but alive and well. I couldn’t believe it.

Two days later, a postcard arrived in the mail.

They’re always big and so random my boyfriend is also so confused how I’m getting new bruises everyday and at this point so am I. The one on my calf is probably the biggest yet and the most confusing because it developed over night and yesterday had a lump on it. can you get excess and random bruising from simply moving a lot or should I see a doctor?

His checkered polo was buttoned all the way to his chubby little neckbeard, and he wasn’t wearing a tie or blazer, so it was a rare day off from the prototypical uniform. He struck me as the type of guy to read Business Insider’s column on how to ‘*blend in with your people*’ on the road. I guess the previous day's cuff links just weren’t cutting it. You could almost smell the effort in the form of Draco Noir.

“Are you driving?” he sniffed. “I’m ready to take a nap.”

I looked around for a restroom first. The public one was on the far side of the atrium, past a row of planters and artwork in the form of abstract shapes and buzzwords. I left my bags with the human robot and made my way across the room. The floor was freshly polished, and each step clapped back off the walls with a sharp echo. Inside the bathroom was a single toilet. The tissue dispenser was empty, but the sink still worked. There wasn’t a signal on my phone, and the news was a day old. None of my calls or texts were going through. That didn’t seem out of the ordinary, though. There hadn’t been service for miles.

I finished cleaning up and stepped back out into the atrium. Something was off. Everything looked the same. The same tall windows. The same red paint and manicured furniture. But a detail had shifted. Maybe something in the air. I couldn’t quite tell what. Like the whole room had been rearranged when I wasn’t looking.

I turned a corner.

Then I saw her.

A woman stood beside Todd. She was older looking, with gray streaked white hair that hung past her shoulders, and eyebrows so thick they formed a single line across her brow. Her uniform didn’t match. I don’t know why I noticed that first, but I did. The shirt had one logo and the hat had another. Her pants were too tight, and rolls of stretch mark ridden skin leaned out the side of the gap in between her shirt. 

She didn’t say anything, initially, and that was the creepiest part of it all. She just sort of stared at me. Like she expected something to happen. 

Todd kept just as still. He shot me a quick look before his eyes dropped to the floor. 

“Mike,” he whispered when he talked. I realized then that I had never heard him be quiet about anything.  “I think we better do what this woman asks.”

I pulled the key out of my pocket and set it on the desk.

“Alright. Does she want us to check out?”

No sooner than the words exited my mouth, a sharp screech ripped across the atrium, loud enough to force us to our knees. The tone shifted up and down in frequency. It was piercing one second, then rough the next. I couldn’t figure out where it came from until something dropped behind the front desk.

My attention shifted to the chalkboard.

That’s when I noticed the knife.

“Go,” the woman grunted. “Now.”

She dragged the blade across the board a second time. It was horrible. Todd screamed, but I couldn’t hear his words, I could only see his lips move. We got back up to our feet.

Then she pointed at the front door.

“Go,” she repeated. “Now.”

We got up and walked. The stranger followed.  I didn’t look back at her. I didn’t have to. I could feel her breath hot on my shoulders. Her steps fell into an uneven echo, like her shoes didn't fit, or she hadn’t moved in a while. I glanced over at Todd, and his normally polished eggshell had already begun to crack. Sweat gathered on his collar and soaked through the pits of his polo. His expression looked like the features on his face had frozen somewhere between apology and panic mode.

“Please,” he whispered. “I don't know what we’ve done to offend you. Just let us leave.”

The knife poked gently into my back.

“Go.”

We kept it moving. The double doors led to a courtyard in front of the building. Outside, the garden was decorated with flowers and benches. The smell of fresh mulch felt like freedom. I could see our car in the lot. There was nobody else parked there. I hoped this mystery woman, fucked as she was, would simply let us get in and drive away. Maybe she thought we were trespassing, or whatever, but at least then we could put this whole knife-point encounter behind us. 

We marched in an awkward sort of procession, and after the first hundred steps, I was sure that we were home free. But just as Todd reached into his pocket to find his keys, the blade slashed across my peripheral vision. Fuzzy white dice fell to the ground. Bright red blood followed.

 “Go.”

We walked on. Todd limped beside me. He was quiet, now. We left the parking lot behind after a few hundred feet. The manicured landscaping transitioned into a dirt path between dense trees. The forest was quiet. Branches crisscrossed overhead, low enough that we had to duck in places. The woman stayed behind us.

A hill rose out of the woods with the early morning fog right above it. We reached the crest. 

That was when the Valley opened up in earnest.

“This can’t be real….” Todd mumbled out in front. “Does nobody work in this town?”

A clearing about a mile wide spanned a gap in between the trees. Every inch of it was covered with people. There were parents with kids and folks in uniforms. There were wheelchair-bound patients in hospital gowns and beds with monitors and nurses attached. There were *dozens* of them, maybe hundreds, but not one of them said a thing. 

It was disturbing. They were the quietest group of people I had ever seen. Nobody coughed, nobody whispered, nobody laughed. They didn’t even seem to look at each other. The only sounds were the steady movement of their feet on the dirt and the soft rustle of clothing that brushed together. 

A weather-beaten brown building sat at the center of the clearing. It couldn’t have been taller than a couple of floors, no wider than about a hundred yards. There weren’t any roads that led to it. No walkways either. It looked like somebody had just taken the place and plopped it in the center of the valley.

The structure itself was in rough shape. Vines crawled across the face of the faded red brick. Weeds gathered around the foundation. The roof sagged in the middle, a drainpipe dangled from the side, and the windows were stained to the point where we couldn't see through, even in the daylight.

A sign over the awning read *Library* in chipped white lettering.

The woman pointed ahead, and we hustled down the hill to join the crowd. The group was packed tighter towards the front. The people seemed exhausted, or angry, even. Like the journey had taken everything out of them. Todd tiptoed beside a burly man in pajamas. I fell into line behind a mother and her two young children.

I tried to get them to look at me. The kids, the adults, anybody. I wanted to scream, but I could still feel the knife against my back, and every wrong move felt like it could cut my kidney right out of the fat.

“My daughter expects me to be home tonight,” Todd spoke plainly through the throngs of bodies. “She won’t understand why I’m gone.""

Nobody answered him. The townsfolk were restless by this point. Arms and shoulders pressed up against my back. One lady nearly nicked her hand on the knife. A row of heavy boulders had been laid out to form a path through the field. The formation funneled the people into a tight wedge near the door. But they weren’t moving. It was like they were stuck. The big man in pajamas shoved a gurney aside and forced his way to the front. He slammed on the oak exterior with his fist three times, in rhythm.

The double door swung open.

And then the crowd started to move.

The whole line broke apart. Parents ditched their families. Nurses abandoned their patients. The push from the back didn’t stop. A few people fell down next to the rocks. One of them was an older man with white hair and a gold tee-shirt ripped at the seams. He vanished beneath the weight of rushed footsteps and appeared again, face down in the dirt.

“What are they doing?” I shouted over the chaos to the stranger behind us. “What the hell is this?”

She glanced at me and smiled like it was obvious.

“They’re hungry.”

The crowd rushed into the building like salmon headed upstream to spawn. Dust kicked up behind them. Floorboards creaked under the weight. The stampede was over in about ten seconds.

And then it was quiet.

A handful of people hadn’t made it inside. Some were moving. Some, like the old man, were not. I’ll never forget the look of determination on a teenager with mangled legs and a row of bloodied cuts in his face. He dragged himself toward the door, inch by inch, until a last-minute straggler shoved him back down. His skull hit a rock with a sickening *crack*.

He didn’t move after that.

“Go,” the woman gestured. “Inside.”

We did what she told us. The inside of the library looked like it had been furnished by someone with a very small budget and a fond memory of the year 1997. The walls were pale green and covered in laminated newspaper clippings about science fairs and fundraisers. The chairs were upholstered in faded fabric and arranged around metal tables stacked with old magazines. An empty fish tank sat on a low shelf, but there wasn't any water, just a plastic log and a thin layer of gravel.

“What the heck are we doing here?” Todd spat. “We have a right to know.”

The stranger tilted her knife towards a staircase tucked into the back corner of the room. She seemed more agitated than before. Almost antsy. Her eyes were bloodshot, and she kept scratching her neck until the skin turned red. Her fingernails were peeled and bloodied. There was a look on her face like a crackhead hungry for a fix.

""Go.""

The air got hotter as we climbed. The steps rose above a long and narrow hallway where the mob had already vanished from view. At the top was a plain gray door with the word **Storage** labeled at the top. Our captor fiddled with the lock for a second. Then she poked the broad side of the blade into Todd's back.

“Inside.”

 The room was small and slanted at the edges, almost like a makeshift attic office. A closet took up the far corner. Two narrow windows let in bright sunlight that illuminated a thin strip like tape across the wood paneling. The air smelled of old carpet and moldy paper, combined with something sharp and chemical. 

“Stay here,” the woman shouted. “No leave.”

And with that, the door slammed shut. 

A lock clicked behind it.

Todd paced around the narrow space in tight circles. His breathing got heavy. He swallowed hard and pressed a hand to his chest. He looked like he was about to pass out. For a second, I thought I was going to have to catch him. “We need a way out,” he babbled. “Mike. We can’t stay up here. You understand that, right?”

I didn't say anything back. There had to be something useful in the room. Something we could use to defend ourselves, or help us escape. I tried the windows and they were rusted shut. I pressed my palm into the glass and shoved. Nothing moved. 

“What are we going to do?” The closet was next. A cardboard box sat near the back with a faded Home Depot logo stamped on the side. I pulled it out and crouched to check the contents. Inside was a toolbox that looked like it hadn't been touched in years. A broken level sat beside a pair of pliers with the grip half melted. An old, rusted hammer rested on top. “This will work.” I went back to the closet to take another look. A gap in the floorboards had opened where the toolbox had been. Pale light bled through the cracks. The smell coming off it was stronger than before, and it was thick with chemicals, something like bleach or melted plastic. It stung a little when I breathed it in.

“Do you hear that?”

At first, I thought it was the pipes. But the sound didn’t match anything I’d heard before. It was a rhythmic clicking, in steady, gurgling intervals. Almost like wet lips trying to keep time over a beat. I dropped down to the ground and pressed my eye to the gap in the floorboards. That’s when the room beneath us opened up, and I knew we’d stepped into something we weren’t meant to see.

""What is it?"" Todd snapped. ""What's happening?""

The main hall was massive, but everybody was gathered around the center. A row of pushed-together desks guarded three thick steel drums. A small group of young women in white moved between them in slow, deliberate circles. Each of them dragged long-handled ladles through the surface through pools of translucent orange liquid. The whole crowd watched them work in silence while the concoction bubbled like lava and melted cheese.

""Not sure,"" I muttered. ""Looks like they're lined up for something.""

A figure stepped into view from the furthest queue. I recognized the face. He was the same kid from earlier, the one who cracked his skull on the pavement. Something about the way he moved just seemed wrong. The bones in his legs bent at awkward angles. Each step was like watching a puppet try to figure out its strings. His face was pale and streaked with dried blood, but he didn't seem to mind the cuts and bruises, he just kept going, arms at his side, eyes ahead.

“This is weird,” I muttered out loud. “Now they’re getting ready to eat.""

The teenager shuffled in front of the vats. He seemed to be the first of the townsfolk to be seen by the lunch ladies from hell. They swarmed him in a group. One of them looked him up and down. Another sniffed him by the collarbone. Apparently satisfied with the result, the two of them scurried out of the way, while a third forced the kid down to his knees in front of the bile.

She lifted a utensil to his nose.

She pinched his nostrils.

She waited.

After a moment, a pale white slug forced itself free.

“Oh my God,” I covered my mouth to keep from vomiting. “This is sick.”

The woman caught the thing in her dish before she walked toward a smaller drum at the back of the room. She lowered it inside carefully, like it was made of glass. 

The kid went limp. One of the others stepped in behind him and gently dunked his head into the orange slop.

He screamed when the second slug emerged from the slime.

Then he sobbed as it crawled across his mouth and up his nose.

“They're parasites,” I muddled my words trying to explain. “They're inside of them...”

The kid twitched. His eyes rolled back. For a second, I thought he was about to collapse again. Then his whole body seized. He snapped upright and started laughing. It was a hysterical, panicked, frenzied sort of laughter. The type where you have to catch your breath in between. He bolted across the room and slammed his head into a wall. Then he bounced off and did it again. And again. He dropped to his knees and stared at the blood on his hands. Then he licked them. Slowly. As if he was savoring the taste.

Todd reached around me and pulled the hammer off the toolbox. I couldn’t stop him. Everything happened too fast. There wasn't any time to react. He stepped past me and smacked the window with one clean smash. The glass cracked and blew apart. Shards bounced across the floor.

I was still looking through the crack in the floorboards when the energy shifted. Every head in the hall below snapped toward me. Not toward the window. Not the noise. Me. Like they knew exactly where I was. Like they’d just been waiting for a reason.

And then they started to run.

The teenager was the fastest. He pushed the others out of the way as he dropped to all fours and sprinted to the door at the end of the long hallway. I got up and started to move myself. Todd was trying to force himself out of the window. But he didn’t quite fit. His pants were torn where the jagged pieces bit deep into his legs. His shirt was covered in red. He twisted hard, trying to shove through, but the frame scraped him raw. He yelled back at me as footsteps rushed up the steps. Then he turned around.

There was something evil in his eyes when he hit me.

I slammed into the floor hard. My head bounced against the tile, and everything got slow. My ears rang. My vision pulsed at the edges. I could still hear him moving somewhere above me. Todd. He was angry about something.

The door burst open.

The mob poured in.

The man in pajamas spotted him first. Todd had one foot out the window, but the cuff of his khakis was caught on the radiator. He couldn’t move. The big guy yanked him by the ankle and pulled him back inside. The rest of them screamed like animals. They clawed at his arms and dragged him across the floor. Todd kicked. He begged. He said he was sorry. He said he didn’t mean to. They didn’t care. They hauled him out the door and back down the stairs, still yelling, still pleading for me to come and save him.

And then it was quiet again.

I waited by the door for a few seconds. Just long enough to know they weren't coming back. The screams didn’t stop. They only got worse. Todd’s voice had turned hoarse and jagged, like he swallowed some sandpaper. There weren’t any words to be heard anymore, just guttural moans. The mob loved it. They made these horrible little noises. Snorts. Gasps. Something that almost sounded like applause. They were excited, now. And that horrific fucking clicking sound didn't stop, either. It only got louder.

I stepped through the doorway and into the hall. My legs wobbled. My skull throbbed. The world tilted every few steps, but I didn’t stop. I just walked.

Down the steps.

Through the library.

And out the front door.

For a moment, I felt guilty. I really did. But then I thought about the hammer. And those stupid fucking khakis. And all of the horribly condescending moments that led to the one when that cowardly, selfish little asshole tried to sacrifice *me* so that *he* could survive.

And then I just kept moving.

The woods were cold and dark, then. The early morning had given way to a gentle rain that slipped through the trees and clung to the branches. Mud sucked at my shoes. Branches scratched at my shoulders.

I followed the same path we took in and ended up in the field that led to the parking lot. 

Our car was still parked at the back. I spotted the keys with the little white dice in the gravel where we left them, wet and smeared with blood. I picked them up, unlocked the door, and slid into the driver’s seat. I stared through the windshield for a while.

Then I started the engine and drove away.

That night, I reported everything to the police in my hometown. I felt safer there. I expected they'd ask me more questions, maybe even think I had something to do with it. Maybe I did. I still couldn’t shake the guilt of leaving my coworker behind.

Before long, the secretary returned and told me they had located Todd. They spoke to him on the phone, and he was a little shaken up, but alive and well. I couldn’t believe it.

Two days later, a postcard arrived in the mail.

**Greetings from scenic White Valley**

Now I know why.,"A phone call came in with the sun and found me sleeping in a shitty hotel bed somewhere deep in the buttholes of southern New Jersey. My head hurt like hell, my stomach was about three seconds from turning, and I just wanted to get some rest. But motherfucking Todd couldn’t help himself. The dude was like a corporate wind up doll, born and bred in the basements of corporate America to wake up at the crack of dawn and take everybody’s money.

“It rained last night, right, Mike?” he coughed through a mouthful of menthol lozenges. “I heard water on the roof. And the wind. Jeez. The entire building shook like the devil himself was playing maracas!”

My memory took a few seconds to catch up with the conversation. We’d been driving all day, through the turnpikes and over endless skyline bridges that hovered high above the factories of the Northeast. We didn’t arrive at the dingy little inn until sometime around nine that night. The lights were all off. The lot was dark. It was drizzling, then, at least I thought as much.

“Anyway, I went out for a cup of coffee this morning. The ground was bone dry. I can’t figure out why.”

An old alarm clock buzzed next to a row of empty bottles. The television blared white static. I wasn’t really listening. I couldn’t even find my pants. The room bore all of the typical signs of my personal downfall. A large, empty bag of potato chips was stationed by the refrigerator, with a case of Blue Moon carefully placed beside it. The mattress was soaked with sweat and the sheets were twisted about. It looked like somebody either had an exorcism or got drunk watching reruns of family comedies. Given my history, I settled on the latter.

“That’s not even the weirdest part,” Todd whispered. “Nobody’s here. I checked the halls, the lobby, bathrooms. The entire building is empty. It’s freaky.”

I took the comment with a grain of salt. Todd had a tendency to worry. That was actually putting it mildly. The man was a full-blown panicker. His fear of flying was the sole reason we were forced to drive five-hundred miles across the fuckin’ country, shilling shitty software to worse people who didn't care all along the way. His anxieties weren’t even the worst part, it was the colossal arrogance that drove me up a wall more than anything else. He was one of those guys that seemed to take sadistic pleasure in competition with the GPS. Every wrong turn was a victory in the battle of Todd vs. the technology. That was how we ended up so far off the beaten path. Some people just don't want their tribal knowledge to be lost. 

I bet he could have stuck that quote in his corny little PowerPoint.

“Are you ready yet?” he asked. “Let's go. I don’t like this place very much. Something about it gives me butterflies, and not the fun ones.”

As much as I hated to admit it, he wasn’t totally wrong. We booked the rooms through one of those shady discount travel sites, about an hour ahead of showing up there in the first place. The building seemed modern enough. The parking lot was well lit, and the lobby was decorated with hung plasma TVs and new furniture. But when we made it to the front desk to check in, there wasn’t a single person around to greet us. 

No clerks, no guests, nothing.

Just a single sign-in sheet, a stack of faded brochures, and a rack full of keys labeled in neat, faded handwriting. We grabbed two at random. Todd shuffled toward his room, and I found the minibar in mine. After that, things got hazy.

“Seriously,” he snapped impatiently. “Let’s go. I’ll meet you in the lobby in five minutes.”

I gave it a second before I got out of bed. The nausea eased with a gulp from a plastic water bottle stashed under my pillow. The shower didn’t run, and neither did the sink, so that same bottle came in handy when I needed to brush my teeth. I finished getting ready and hated on myself in the mirror a little bit. I wasn’t the type to drink myself stupid. It was just a transition period. Nothing was bad. Nothing was good. I was just in a rut. At least, that was the excuse.

We met by the checkout desk. Nothing had changed. The lobby was quiet and untouched. Chairs were still perfectly angled around fake plants, and the same stack of brochures sat patiently collecting dust on the counter. I looked around for a bathroom that actually worked, but before I could find it, pretentious sneakers squeaked down the hallway behind me.

""Welcome to scenic White Valley,"" Todd announced in his best radio voice. ""Home of absolutely nobody.""

He looked way too pleased with himself for a Monday morning. His checkered polo was buttoned all the way to his chubby little neckbeard, and he wasn’t wearing a tie or blazer, so it was a rare day off from the prototypical uniform.

An empty fish tank sat on a low shelf, but there wasn't any water, just a plastic log and a thin layer of gravel.

“What the heck are we doing here?” Todd spat. “We have a right to know.”

The stranger tilted her knife towards a staircase tucked into the back corner of the room. She seemed more agitated than before. Almost antsy. Her eyes were bloodshot, and she kept scratching her neck until the skin turned red. Her fingernails were peeled and bloodied. There was a look on her face like a crackhead hungry for a fix.

""Go.""

The air got hotter as we climbed. The steps rose above a long and narrow hallway where the mob had already vanished from view. At the top was a plain gray door with the word **Storage** labeled at the top. Our captor fiddled with the lock for a second. Then she poked the broad side of the blade into Todd's back.

“Inside.”

 The room was small and slanted at the edges, almost like a makeshift attic office. A closet took up the far corner. Two narrow windows let in bright sunlight that illuminated a thin strip like tape across the wood paneling. The air smelled of old carpet and moldy paper, combined with something sharp and chemical. 

“Stay here,” the woman shouted. “No leave.”

And with that, the door slammed shut. 

A lock clicked behind it.

Todd paced around the narrow space in tight circles. His breathing got heavy. He swallowed hard and pressed a hand to his chest. He looked like he was about to pass out. For a second, I thought I was going to have to catch him. “We need a way out,” he babbled. “Mike. We can’t stay up here. You understand that, right?”

I didn't say anything back. There had to be something useful in the room. Something we could use to defend ourselves, or help us escape. I tried the windows and they were rusted shut. I pressed my palm into the glass and shoved. Nothing moved. 

“What are we going to do?” The closet was next. A cardboard box sat near the back with a faded Home Depot logo stamped on the side. I pulled it out and crouched to check the contents. Inside was a toolbox that looked like it hadn't been touched in years. A broken level sat beside a pair of pliers with the grip half melted. An old, rusted hammer rested on top. “This will work.” I went back to the closet to take another look. A gap in the floorboards had opened where the toolbox had been. Pale light bled through the cracks. The smell coming off it was stronger than before, and it was thick with chemicals, something like bleach or melted plastic. It stung a little when I breathed it in.

“Do you hear that?”

At first, I thought it was the pipes. But the sound didn’t match anything I’d heard before. It was a rhythmic clicking, in steady, gurgling intervals. Almost like wet lips trying to keep time over a beat. I dropped down to the ground and pressed my eye to the gap in the floorboards. That’s when the room beneath us opened up, and I knew we’d stepped into something we weren’t meant to see.

""What is it?"" Todd snapped. ""What's happening?""

The main hall was massive, but everybody was gathered around the center. A row of pushed-together desks guarded three thick steel drums. A small group of young women in white moved between them in slow, deliberate circles. Each of them dragged long-handled ladles through the surface through pools of translucent orange liquid. The whole crowd watched them work in silence while the concoction bubbled like lava and melted cheese.

""Not sure,"" I muttered. ""Looks like they're lined up for something.""

A figure stepped into view from the furthest queue. I recognized the face. He was the same kid from earlier, the one who cracked his skull on the pavement. Something about the way he moved just seemed wrong. The bones in his legs bent at awkward angles. Each step was like watching a puppet try to figure out its strings. His face was pale and streaked with dried blood, but he didn't seem to mind the cuts and bruises, he just kept going, arms at his side, eyes ahead.

“This is weird,” I muttered out loud. “Now they’re getting ready to eat.""

The teenager shuffled in front of the vats. He seemed to be the first of the townsfolk to be seen by the lunch ladies from hell. They swarmed him in a group. One of them looked him up and down. Another sniffed him by the collarbone. Apparently satisfied with the result, the two of them scurried out of the way, while a third forced the kid down to his knees in front of the bile.

She lifted a utensil to his nose.

She pinched his nostrils.

She waited.

After a moment, a pale white slug forced itself free.

“Oh my God,” I covered my mouth to keep from vomiting. “This is sick.”

The woman caught the thing in her dish before she walked toward a smaller drum at the back of the room. She lowered it inside carefully, like it was made of glass. 

The kid went limp. One of the others stepped in behind him and gently dunked his head into the orange slop.

He screamed when the second slug emerged from the slime.

Then he sobbed as it crawled across his mouth and up his nose.

“They're parasites,” I muddled my words trying to explain. “They're inside of them...”

The kid twitched. His eyes rolled back. For a second, I thought he was about to collapse again. Then his whole body seized. He snapped upright and started laughing. It was a hysterical, panicked, frenzied sort of laughter. The type where you have to catch your breath in between. He bolted across the room and slammed his head into a wall. Then he bounced off and did it again. And again. He dropped to his knees and stared at the blood on his hands. Then he licked them. Slowly. As if he was savoring the taste.

Todd reached around me and pulled the hammer off the toolbox. I couldn’t stop him. Everything happened too fast. There wasn't any time to react. He stepped past me and smacked the window with one clean smash. The glass cracked and blew apart. Shards bounced across the floor.

I was still looking through the crack in the floorboards when the energy shifted. Every head in the hall below snapped toward me. Not toward the window. Not the noise. Me. Like they knew exactly where I was. Like they’d just been waiting for a reason.

And then they started to run.

The teenager was the fastest. He pushed the others out of the way as he dropped to all fours and sprinted to the door at the end of the long hallway. I got up and started to move myself. Todd was trying to force himself out of the window. But he didn’t quite fit. His pants were torn where the jagged pieces bit deep into his legs. His shirt was covered in red. He twisted hard, trying to shove through, but the frame scraped him raw. He yelled back at me as footsteps rushed up the steps. Then he turned around.

There was something evil in his eyes when he hit me.

I slammed into the floor hard. My head bounced against the tile, and everything got slow. My ears rang. My vision pulsed at the edges. I could still hear him moving somewhere above me. Todd. He was angry about something.

The door burst open.

The mob poured in.

The man in pajamas spotted him first. Todd had one foot out the window, but the cuff of his khakis was caught on the radiator. He couldn’t move. The big guy yanked him by the ankle and pulled him back inside. The rest of them screamed like animals. They clawed at his arms and dragged him across the floor. Todd kicked. He begged. He said he was sorry. He said he didn’t mean to. They didn’t care. They hauled him out the door and back down the stairs, still yelling, still pleading for me to come and save him.

And then it was quiet again.

I waited by the door for a few seconds. Just long enough to know they weren't coming back. The screams didn’t stop. They only got worse. Todd’s voice had turned hoarse and jagged, like he swallowed some sandpaper. There weren’t any words to be heard anymore, just guttural moans. The mob loved it. They made these horrible little noises. Snorts. Gasps. Something that almost sounded like applause. They were excited, now. And that horrific fucking clicking sound didn't stop, either. It only got louder.

I stepped through the doorway and into the hall. My legs wobbled. My skull throbbed. The world tilted every few steps, but I didn’t stop. I just walked.

Down the steps.

Through the library.

And out the front door.

For a moment, I felt guilty. I really did. But then I thought about the hammer. And those stupid fucking khakis. And all of the horribly condescending moments that led to the one when that cowardly, selfish little asshole tried to sacrifice *me* so that *he* could survive.

And then I just kept moving.

The woods were cold and dark, then. The early morning had given way to a gentle rain that slipped through the trees and clung to the branches. Mud sucked at my shoes. Branches scratched at my shoulders.

I followed the same path we took in and ended up in the field that led to the parking lot. 

Our car was still parked at the back. I spotted the keys with the little white dice in the gravel where we left them, wet and smeared with blood. I picked them up, unlocked the door, and slid into the driver’s seat. I stared through the windshield for a while.

Then I started the engine and drove away.

That night, I reported everything to the police in my hometown. I felt safer there. I expected they'd ask me more questions, maybe even think I had something to do with it. Maybe I did. I still couldn’t shake the guilt of leaving my coworker behind.

Before long, the secretary returned and told me they had located Todd. They spoke to him on the phone, and he was a little shaken up, but alive and well. I couldn’t believe it.

Two days later, a postcard arrived in the mail.

My husband is currently working from home, but we’ve been having a tough time lately — we live in Parishkaar, and unfortunately, our building recently caught fire. Because of that, WFH from home isn’t really an option for now.

We’re looking for good places nearby (preferably around Maninagar, Paldi, or even a bit further if it’s worth it) where he can work comfortably during the day. Could be a cafe, coworking space, or even a quiet library.

Ideally looking for a place with:

Reliable Wi-Fi
Comfortable seating
Power outlets
Not too loud or crowded
Decent coffee/food if it’s a cafe
Would really appreciate any suggestions from folks in the area. Thanks in advance!",1,1744809133.0,ahmedabad,1,1.0,False
1k0k2tx,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1k0k2tx/i_stayed_in_a_hotel_that_was_totally_abandoned/,I stayed in a hotel that was totally abandoned. Now I know why.,"A phone call came in with the sun and found me sleeping in a shitty hotel bed somewhere deep in the buttholes of southern New Jersey. My head hurt like hell, my stomach was about three seconds from turning, and I just wanted to get some rest. But motherfucking Todd couldn’t help himself. The dude was like a corporate wind up doll, born and bred in the basements of corporate America to wake up at the crack of dawn and take everybody’s money.

“It rained last night, right, Mike?” he coughed through a mouthful of menthol lozenges. “I heard water on the roof. And the wind. Jeez. The entire building shook like the devil himself was playing maracas!”

My memory took a few seconds to catch up with the conversation. We’d been driving all day, through the turnpikes and over endless skyline bridges that hovered high above the factories of the Northeast. We didn’t arrive at the dingy little inn until sometime around nine that night. The lights were all off. The lot was dark. It was drizzling, then, at least I thought as much.

“Anyway, I went out for a cup of coffee this morning. The ground was bone dry. I can’t figure out why.”

An old alarm clock buzzed next to a row of empty bottles. The television blared white static. I wasn’t really listening. I couldn’t even find my pants. The room bore all of the typical signs of my personal downfall. A large, empty bag of potato chips was stationed by the refrigerator, with a case of Blue Moon carefully placed beside it. The mattress was soaked with sweat and the sheets were twisted about. It looked like somebody either had an exorcism or got drunk watching reruns of family comedies. Given my history, I settled on the latter.

“That’s not even the weirdest part,” Todd whispered. “Nobody’s here. I checked the halls, the lobby, bathrooms. The entire building is empty. It’s freaky.”

I took the comment with a grain of salt. Todd had a tendency to worry. That was actually putting it mildly. The man was a full-blown panicker. His fear of flying was the sole reason we were forced to drive five-hundred miles across the fuckin’ country, shilling shitty software to worse people who didn't care all along the way. His anxieties weren’t even the worst part, it was the colossal arrogance that drove me up a wall more than anything else. He was one of those guys that seemed to take sadistic pleasure in competition with the GPS. Every wrong turn was a victory in the battle of Todd vs. the technology. That was how we ended up so far off the beaten path. Some people just don't want their tribal knowledge to be lost. 

I bet he could have stuck that quote in his corny little PowerPoint.

“Are you ready yet?” he asked. “Let's go. I don’t like this place very much. Something about it gives me butterflies, and not the fun ones.”

As much as I hated to admit it, he wasn’t totally wrong. We booked the rooms through one of those shady discount travel sites, about an hour ahead of showing up there in the first place. The building seemed modern enough. The parking lot was well lit, and the lobby was decorated with hung plasma TVs and new furniture. But when we made it to the front desk to check in, there wasn’t a single person around to greet us. 

No clerks, no guests, nothing.

Just a single sign-in sheet, a stack of faded brochures, and a rack full of keys labeled in neat, faded handwriting. We grabbed two at random. Todd shuffled toward his room, and I found the minibar in mine. After that, things got hazy.

“Seriously,” he snapped impatiently. “Let’s go. I’ll meet you in the lobby in five minutes.”

I gave it a second before I got out of bed. The nausea eased with a gulp from a plastic water bottle stashed under my pillow. The shower didn’t run, and neither did the sink, so that same bottle came in handy when I needed to brush my teeth. I finished getting ready and hated on myself in the mirror a little bit. I wasn’t the type to drink myself stupid. It was just a transition period. Nothing was bad. Nothing was good. I was just in a rut. At least, that was the excuse.

We met by the checkout desk. Nothing had changed. The lobby was quiet and untouched. Chairs were still perfectly angled around fake plants, and the same stack of brochures sat patiently collecting dust on the counter. I looked around for a bathroom that actually worked, but before I could find it, pretentious sneakers squeaked down the hallway behind me.

""Welcome to scenic White Valley,"" Todd announced in his best radio voice. ""Home of absolutely nobody.""

He looked way too pleased with himself for a Monday morning. His checkered polo was buttoned all the way to his chubby little neckbeard, and he wasn’t wearing a tie or blazer, so it was a rare day off from the prototypical uniform. He struck me as the type of guy to read Business Insider’s column on how to ‘*blend in with your people*’ on the road. I guess the previous day's cuff links just weren’t cutting it. You could almost smell the effort in the form of Draco Noir.

“Are you driving?” he sniffed. “I’m ready to take a nap.”

I looked around for a restroom first. The public one was on the far side of the atrium, past a row of planters and artwork in the form of abstract shapes and buzzwords. I left my bags with the human robot and made my way across the room. The floor was freshly polished, and each step clapped back off the walls with a sharp echo. Inside the bathroom was a single toilet. The tissue dispenser was empty, but the sink still worked. There wasn’t a signal on my phone, and the news was a day old. None of my calls or texts were going through. That didn’t seem out of the ordinary, though. There hadn’t been service for miles.

I finished cleaning up and stepped back out into the atrium. Something was off. Everything looked the same. The same tall windows. The same red paint and manicured furniture. But a detail had shifted. Maybe something in the air. I couldn’t quite tell what. Like the whole room had been rearranged when I wasn’t looking.

I turned a corner.

Then I saw her.

A woman stood beside Todd. She was older looking, with gray streaked white hair that hung past her shoulders, and eyebrows so thick they formed a single line across her brow. Her uniform didn’t match. I don’t know why I noticed that first, but I did. The shirt had one logo and the hat had another. Her pants were too tight, and rolls of stretch mark ridden skin leaned out the side of the gap in between her shirt. 

She didn’t say anything, initially, and that was the creepiest part of it all. She just sort of stared at me. Like she expected something to happen. 

Todd kept just as still. He shot me a quick look before his eyes dropped to the floor. 

“Mike,” he whispered when he talked. I realized then that I had never heard him be quiet about anything.  “I think we better do what this woman asks.”

I pulled the key out of my pocket and set it on the desk.

“Alright. Does she want us to check out?”

No sooner than the words exited my mouth, a sharp screech ripped across the atrium, loud enough to force us to our knees. The tone shifted up and down in frequency. It was piercing one second, then rough the next. I couldn’t figure out where it came from until something dropped behind the front desk.

My attention shifted to the chalkboard.

That’s when I noticed the knife.

“Go,” the woman grunted. “Now.”

She dragged the blade across the board a second time. It was horrible. Todd screamed, but I couldn’t hear his words, I could only see his lips move. We got back up to our feet.

Then she pointed at the front door.

“Go,” she repeated. “Now.”

We got up and walked. The stranger followed.  I didn’t look back at her. I didn’t have to. I could feel her breath hot on my shoulders. Her steps fell into an uneven echo, like her shoes didn't fit, or she hadn’t moved in a while. I glanced over at Todd, and his normally polished eggshell had already begun to crack. Sweat gathered on his collar and soaked through the pits of his polo. His expression looked like the features on his face had frozen somewhere between apology and panic mode.

“Please,” he whispered. “I don't know what we’ve done to offend you. Just let us leave.”

The knife poked gently into my back.

“Go.”

We kept it moving. The double doors led to a courtyard in front of the building. Outside, the garden was decorated with flowers and benches. The smell of fresh mulch felt like freedom. I could see our car in the lot. There was nobody else parked there. I hoped this mystery woman, fucked as she was, would simply let us get in and drive away. Maybe she thought we were trespassing, or whatever, but at least then we could put this whole knife-point encounter behind us. 

We marched in an awkward sort of procession, and after the first hundred steps, I was sure that we were home free. But just as Todd reached into his pocket to find his keys, the blade slashed across my peripheral vision. Fuzzy white dice fell to the ground. Bright red blood followed.

 “Go.”

We walked on. Todd limped beside me. He was quiet, now. We left the parking lot behind after a few hundred feet. The manicured landscaping transitioned into a dirt path between dense trees. The forest was quiet. Branches crisscrossed overhead, low enough that we had to duck in places. The woman stayed behind us.

A hill rose out of the woods with the early morning fog right above it. We reached the crest. 

That was when the Valley opened up in earnest.

“This can’t be real….” Todd mumbled out in front. “Does nobody work in this town?”

A clearing about a mile wide spanned a gap in between the trees. Every inch of it was covered with people. There were parents with kids and folks in uniforms. There were wheelchair-bound patients in hospital gowns and beds with monitors and nurses attached. There were *dozens* of them, maybe hundreds, but not one of them said a thing. 

It was disturbing. They were the quietest group of people I had ever seen. Nobody coughed, nobody whispered, nobody laughed. They didn’t even seem to look at each other. The only sounds were the steady movement of their feet on the dirt and the soft rustle of clothing that brushed together. 

A weather-beaten brown building sat at the center of the clearing. It couldn’t have been taller than a couple of floors, no wider than about a hundred yards. There weren’t any roads that led to it. No walkways either. It looked like somebody had just taken the place and plopped it in the center of the valley.

The structure itself was in rough shape. Vines crawled across the face of the faded red brick. Weeds gathered around the foundation. The roof sagged in the middle, a drainpipe dangled from the side, and the windows were stained to the point where we couldn't see through, even in the daylight.

A sign over the awning read *Library* in chipped white lettering.

The woman pointed ahead, and we hustled down the hill to join the crowd. The group was packed tighter towards the front. The people seemed exhausted, or angry, even. Like the journey had taken everything out of them. Todd tiptoed beside a burly man in pajamas. I fell into line behind a mother and her two young children.

I tried to get them to look at me. The kids, the adults, anybody. I wanted to scream, but I could still feel the knife against my back, and every wrong move felt like it could cut my kidney right out of the fat.

“My daughter expects me to be home tonight,” Todd spoke plainly through the throngs of bodies. “She won’t understand why I’m gone.""

Nobody answered him. The townsfolk were restless by this point. Arms and shoulders pressed up against my back. One lady nearly nicked her hand on the knife. A row of heavy boulders had been laid out to form a path through the field. The formation funneled the people into a tight wedge near the door. But they weren’t moving. It was like they were stuck. The big man in pajamas shoved a gurney aside and forced his way to the front. He slammed on the oak exterior with his fist three times, in rhythm.

The double door swung open.

And then the crowd started to move.

The whole line broke apart. Parents ditched their families. Nurses abandoned their patients. The push from the back didn’t stop. A few people fell down next to the rocks. One of them was an older man with white hair and a gold tee-shirt ripped at the seams. He vanished beneath the weight of rushed footsteps and appeared again, face down in the dirt.

“What are they doing?” I shouted over the chaos to the stranger behind us. “What the hell is this?”

She glanced at me and smiled like it was obvious.

“They’re hungry.”

The crowd rushed into the building like salmon headed upstream to spawn. Dust kicked up behind them. Floorboards creaked under the weight. The stampede was over in about ten seconds.

And then it was quiet.

A handful of people hadn’t made it inside. Some were moving. Some, like the old man, were not. I’ll never forget the look of determination on a teenager with mangled legs and a row of bloodied cuts in his face. He dragged himself toward the door, inch by inch, until a last-minute straggler shoved him back down. His skull hit a rock with a sickening *crack*.

He didn’t move after that.

“Go,” the woman gestured. “Inside.”

We did what she told us. The inside of the library looked like it had been furnished by someone with a very small budget and a fond memory of the year 1997. The walls were pale green and covered in laminated newspaper clippings about science fairs and fundraisers. The chairs were upholstered in faded fabric and arranged around metal tables stacked with old magazines. An empty fish tank sat on a low shelf, but there wasn't any water, just a plastic log and a thin layer of gravel.

“What the heck are we doing here?” Todd spat. “We have a right to know.”

The stranger tilted her knife towards a staircase tucked into the back corner of the room. She seemed more agitated than before. Almost antsy. Her eyes were bloodshot, and she kept scratching her neck until the skin turned red. Her fingernails were peeled and bloodied. There was a look on her face like a crackhead hungry for a fix.

""Go.""

The air got hotter as we climbed. The steps rose above a long and narrow hallway where the mob had already vanished from view. At the top was a plain gray door with the word **Storage** labeled at the top. Our captor fiddled with the lock for a second. Then she poked the broad side of the blade into Todd's back.

“Inside.”

 The room was small and slanted at the edges, almost like a makeshift attic office. A closet took up the far corner. Two narrow windows let in bright sunlight that illuminated a thin strip like tape across the wood paneling. The air smelled of old carpet and moldy paper, combined with something sharp and chemical. 

“Stay here,” the woman shouted. “No leave.”

And with that, the door slammed shut. 

A lock clicked behind it.

Todd paced around the narrow space in tight circles. His breathing got heavy. He swallowed hard and pressed a hand to his chest. He looked like he was about to pass out. For a second, I thought I was going to have to catch him. “We need a way out,” he babbled. “Mike. We can’t stay up here. You understand that, right?”

I didn't say anything back. There had to be something useful in the room. Something we could use to defend ourselves, or help us escape. I tried the windows and they were rusted shut. I pressed my palm into the glass and shoved. Nothing moved.

An old, rusted hammer rested on top. “This will work.” I went back to the closet to take another look. A gap in the floorboards had opened where the toolbox had been. Pale light bled through the cracks. The smell coming off it was stronger than before, and it was thick with chemicals, something like bleach or melted plastic. It stung a little when I breathed it in.

“Do you hear that?”

I followed the same path we took in and ended up in the field that led to the parking lot. 

Our car was still parked at the back. I spotted the keys with the little white dice in the gravel where we left them, wet and smeared with blood. I picked them up, unlocked the door, and slid into the driver’s seat. I stared through the windshield for a while.

Then I started the engine and drove away.

That night, I reported everything to the police in my hometown. I felt safer there. I expected they'd ask me more questions, maybe even think I had something to do with it. Maybe I did. I still couldn’t shake the guilt of leaving my coworker behind.

Before long, the secretary returned and told me they had located Todd. They spoke to him on the phone, and he was a little shaken up, but alive and well. I couldn’t believe it.

Two days later, a postcard arrived in the mail.

Monesy buried his face in NiKo's pajamas and rubbed around. The morning light shone through the sheer curtains, casting a golden edge on his upturned bangs. NiKo gently stroked Monesy's head and chuckled, ""We said we'd go to the amusement park together today. If you don't get up now, you'll miss the first ride on the Ferris wheel."" Monesy opened his eyes drowsily and mumbled, ""But the bed is so warm... I need a hug from NiNi to get up\~"" Saying that, he reached out his hand and snuggled into NiKo's arms like a little cat. NiKo smiled helplessly and picked him up, patting his back gently, ""Alright, alright, a hug and you'll get up. Otherwise, Hunter brother will come and laugh at you later."" 

The aroma of toasted bread wafted from the kitchen. Hunter was busy frying eggs, while NiKo was fiddling with the coffee machine. Monesy hopped over and hugged Hunter's waist from behind, ""Cousin, cousin, the eggs today should be runny\~"" Hunter was startled and almost dropped the spatula in his hand. He smiled helplessly, ""Ilya, you scared me like that. The eggs are going to burn."" Monesy stuck out his tongue and then turned to NiKo, ""The coffee needs a lot of milk, Ilya is afraid of bitterness\~"" NiKo ruffled his hair and said indulgently, ""I know, of course the coffee for our little princess should be sweet."" At the breakfast table, Monesy was munching on a runny egg and swinging his legs, ""Today at the amusement park, Ilya wants to ride the Ferris wheel three times! And eat cotton candy!"" NiKo smiled and handed him a slice of bread spread with jam, ""Alright, alright, whatever you want. But after breakfast, you need to put on your coat. It's windy in the morning."" 

At the amusement park, Monesy was like a happy little bird. NiKo and Hunter followed behind, holding various trinkets they had bought for him. On the Ferris wheel, Monesy leaned against the glass window, his eyes shining, ""NiNi, look over there! So beautiful!"" NiKo followed his finger and saw the setting sun slowly descending in the distance, painting the sky orange and red. ""Ilya, come and sit properly, don't fall."" NiKo gently pulled him, but Monesy leaned into his arms instead, looking up with a mischievous smile, ""With NiNi's hug, I won't fall\~"" NiKo shook his head helplessly but held him tighter. After getting off the Ferris wheel, the sky was gradually darkening, and the lights in the amusement park lit up, like stars fallen to earth. Monesy excitedly pointed to the nearby carousel, his eyes sparkling with anticipation, ""NiNi, Hunter cousin, let's go on the carousel!""",0,1744809112.0,cs2,3,0.5,False

Usually, if someone comes up to his desk he quickly handles whatever work needs to be done and then continues talking to me after.

He works in a dealership for context and doesn’t have many female coworkers. There is this one girl that works there, Miranda, that I have a funny feeling about and have asked him to refrain from being so friendly with her. 

Miranda a few months ago broke up with her boyfriend because he cheated on her (this is what my bf told me). On the same day her bf cheated on her my boyfriend posted a TikTok and I went to repost, like, comment as those are my girlfriend duties and I see Miranda was now following my boyfriend on TikTok - and also liked commented reposted and saved his new video. I thought it was weird based on the timing of her boyfriend cheating on her and breaking up. Which is why I asked him to refrain from speaking from her. 

While we were sitting there not talking, I see him signal to someone that he was on the phone. As this is an odd gesture, since he usually jumps to help everyone who needs something from him, I asked what that was about. 

It was the girl, who we can call Miranda, approaching him at his desk. I curiously asked why he would tell her that we were on the phone and not help her if she needed something. He says he doesn’t know why she would be walking up to him as she works on the opposite side of the dealership. He calls her back over and she says she just wanted to say hi. He explains he sent her away to avoid any issues between us. But ironically, now I feel uneasy. 

He swears they don’t speak at work ever and they are not friendly. And that she was probably going to ask for a coffee pod or something of that nature. I just don’t understand why he would shoo her away for something so minuscule. 

I know I might be jumping to conclusions here. I have some past trauma of being cheated on in almost every relationship I’ve ever been in, along with some of my female friends having sex with ex boyfriends behind my back.

Keto, paleo, low-carb, raw vegan... you name it, I tried it. Each time, I'd either burn out or feel worse than when I started. My digestion was a mess, my sleep was off, and my energy tanked mid-afternoon like clockwork.

Then I came across something different. It wasn’t another ""cut this food out forever"" plan. It was more like a gentle guide — personalized Mediterranean-style meals paired with easy workouts I could actually stick to. It’s called no. Diet (funny name, right?).

Instead of demonizing foods, it helped me understand what *my* body responds to. Within a couple weeks, I noticed real changes:

* My digestion calmed down
* I actually slept through the night
* My mood lifted
* And I didn’t need that 3 PM coffee crash fix

The best part? It didn’t feel like I was “on a diet” at all. Just eating good food and moving my body a little more intentionally.

I’m not saying it’s for everyone (respect to all paths here 🙌), but for anyone who’s tired of the diet rollercoaster and wants something sustainable and kind to their body — this helped me reconnect with mine.

Started at 280 and Currently floating around 242 for the last 6 weeks. It's pretty disappointing to say the least but not giving up. 

I'm testing a theory and moved myself back down to .6mg weekly as when I went up to .75mg the weight loss stopped. Gave it a few weeks to just see if it was my body adjusting but it's just being stubborn at this point.

I usually aim for 1500 cals a day but realistically hit 1800-2000 a day. Last couple weeks I've raised it up as a suggestion to try and get the metabo moving again. Usually hitting around 2200-2300 a day. The only other change to my diet that I've done is I started drinking coffee again around 4-5 weeks ago. (no sugar only some flavor creamer) but even still I track, measure and weigh all my food and don't eat out. I meal prep at home.

I will give myself a treat now and then if its within my calorie budget but not to often. Try to focus on water, protein and fiber. 

I'm going to try this lower dose for another week or two and and then cut the coffee again to get back to square one.  See if I can narrow down some things before going up in dose again. I get pretty good noise and food/hunger control even on these lower doses so I'm hesitant to raise up if I can help it. I want to do the work and not let the medicine do all the work for me if that makes sense.

I've thought about split dosing, stopping for a month or so and restarting etc. Open to suggestions.

# Zebra Toothpaste: 2025's Best Whitening Option?

Zebra toothpaste is a relatively new entrant in the crowded oral hygiene market, promising superior whitening and overall dental health. This product aims to deliver professional-level results from the comfort of your own bathroom, utilizing innovative formulations and a focus on enamel protection. With numerous whitening toothpastes available, it's crucial to determine whether Zebra toothpaste truly stands out and offers a noticeable advantage over its competitors. This review delves into its key features, benefits, and ideal user profile to help you decide if it's the right choice for achieving a brighter, healthier smile.

[[Browse top-rated zebra toothpaste on Amazon]](https://petsknows.com/hot-selling-items/?kw=zebra+toothpaste)
## Key Features Analysis

The Zebra toothpaste boasts a unique formulation designed to both whiten teeth and protect enamel.

**Advanced Whitening Formula:** Zebra toothpaste utilizes a blend of hydrogen peroxide and calcium peroxide as its primary whitening agents. These ingredients work together to break down stains on the tooth's surface and penetrate deeper to address intrinsic discoloration. The concentration of hydrogen peroxide is carefully calibrated to provide effective whitening without causing excessive sensitivity, typically around 0.1%.

The formula also includes micro-polishing agents, such as hydrated silica, which gently remove surface stains during brushing. This dual-action approach ensures both immediate and long-term whitening results. Clinical trials have demonstrated an average of two shades whiter teeth after four weeks of consistent use.

**Enamel Protection Technology:** Recognizing the importance of enamel health, Zebra toothpaste incorporates a unique blend of minerals and fluoride. Hydroxyapatite, the primary mineral component of tooth enamel, is included in the formula to help remineralize and strengthen the enamel surface. This helps to protect against acid erosion and future staining.

Additionally, the toothpaste contains sodium fluoride at a concentration of 0.243%, which is the standard concentration approved by dental associations for cavity prevention. This ensures that while whitening, your teeth also receive essential protection against tooth decay.

**Gentle Abrasiveness:** Many whitening toothpastes are highly abrasive, which can damage enamel over time. Zebra toothpaste addresses this concern with a carefully controlled Relative Dentin Abrasivity (RDA) value. The RDA value of Zebra toothpaste is around 70, which falls within the range considered safe for daily use.

The controlled abrasiveness ensures effective stain removal without causing undue wear on the enamel. This makes it suitable for individuals with sensitive teeth who still desire a whitening effect.

**Unique Flavor Profile:** Zebra toothpaste features a distinctive mint and citrus flavor designed to leave your mouth feeling fresh and clean. The flavor is not overly strong or artificial, providing a pleasant brushing experience. The combination of mint and citrus helps to neutralize bad breath and leaves a refreshing aftertaste.

The flavor profile has been developed in collaboration with flavor experts to ensure it appeals to a wide range of consumers. This attention to detail enhances the overall user experience.

## Core Benefits

Zebra toothpaste offers a range of benefits beyond simple whitening.

**Noticeable Whitening:** Zebra toothpaste delivers visible whitening results within a few weeks of regular use. Many users report seeing a significant improvement in the brightness of their teeth, leading to a more confident smile. This can be particularly beneficial for those who are self-conscious about tooth discoloration.

Consistent use, twice daily, provides a gradual but noticeable change in the shade of your teeth, enhancing your overall appearance. This noticeable improvement can boost self-esteem and improve social interactions.

**Reduced Sensitivity:** Unlike some whitening toothpastes that cause significant sensitivity, Zebra toothpaste is formulated to minimize this issue. The enamel protection technology helps to strengthen enamel and reduce the likelihood of sensitivity. This allows users to whiten their teeth without experiencing discomfort.

This is especially important for individuals who have pre-existing sensitivity or who have had previous whitening treatments that caused pain. The gentle formula allows them to achieve a brighter smile without compromising their comfort.

**Improved Oral Hygiene:** Beyond whitening, Zebra toothpaste promotes overall oral hygiene. The fluoride content helps prevent cavities, while the gentle abrasives remove plaque and bacteria. This contributes to healthier gums and fresher breath.

The comprehensive approach to oral care ensures that you are not only whitening your teeth but also maintaining a healthy mouth. This preventative care can reduce the risk of dental problems in the future.

**Long-Term Enamel Protection:** The inclusion of hydroxyapatite in the formula supports the remineralization of enamel, protecting teeth from acid erosion and future staining. This provides long-term benefits for the health and appearance of your teeth. By strengthening the enamel, Zebra toothpaste helps to prevent future damage and maintain a bright, healthy smile for years to come.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about Zebra toothpaste.

**Is Zebra toothpaste safe for daily use?**

Yes, Zebra toothpaste is compatible with both manual and electric toothbrushes. When using an electric toothbrush, follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding brushing technique and duration.

**How long does it take to see whitening results?**
Most users report seeing noticeable whitening results within two to four weeks of consistent use, brushing twice daily. However, individual results may vary depending on factors such as the severity of staining and brushing habits.

## Competitor Comparison

Here's a comparison of Zebra toothpaste with two of its leading competitors.

### Product Comparison Overview

#### Zebra Toothpaste
- **Whitening Agents:** Hydrogen peroxide and calcium peroxide
- **Enamel Protection:** Hydroxyapatite and fluoride
- **Abrasiveness (RDA):** Approximately 70

#### Crest 3D White Radiant Mint
- **Whitening Agents:** Hydrated silica and sodium hexametaphosphate

### Key Differences Summary
Zebra toothpaste offers a balance of effective whitening and enamel protection, with an RDA value similar to Colgate Optic White Renewal. Crest 3D White Radiant Mint, while effective at whitening, has a significantly higher RDA value, which may be a concern for those with sensitive teeth. Zebra's use of hydroxyapatite provides an additional layer of enamel protection that is not found in the other two brands. For users prioritizing enamel health alongside whitening, Zebra toothpaste offers a compelling advantage.

## Ideal User Profile

Zebra toothpaste is well-suited for various user types.

**Individuals with Mild to Moderate Staining:** Those with surface stains from coffee, tea, or wine will find Zebra toothpaste particularly effective at whitening their teeth. The combination of hydrogen peroxide and micro-polishing agents works to remove these stains and reveal a brighter smile.

**People with Sensitive Teeth:** Thanks to its lower abrasiveness and enamel protection technology, Zebra toothpaste is a suitable option for individuals who experience sensitivity with other whitening toothpastes. The gentle formula minimizes the risk of discomfort while still delivering noticeable whitening results.

It is particularly well-suited for those with mild to moderate staining and sensitivity issues.

I got to know this one guy from the library and we started to hang out a lot (almost everyday). I told him a lot about my past struggles (like family issues, bullying in school etc) and he was a good listener.

He eventually brought me to his church and I met some nice people there. Over time, I got to learn his behaviour even more and I realized he wasn't so nice. His brother tried telling me how good Donald J Trump is and how I should see what he's actually doing for the people etc. Turns out the guy I met from the library is also a trump supporter and was subtly trying to make me become a DJT supporter as well (saying all kinds of things about him and how the media just likes to make him look bad).

I made it clear I wasn't a supporter of his and when asked why is it because your dad is a democrat I said ""yes, partly but not entirely"" and he asked me to give him a percentage of how much influence my dad has over me and I said I wasn't going to quantify that. This turned into an argument the next day when I said I didn't appreciate how he boxed me into the convo about politics and made assumptions and asked for an apology.

Not only did he refuse the apology, failed to take accountability for it by projecting onto me. He said we should meet in person to discuss this because he doesn't like texting. We met up and I bought him a Starbucks coffee and I got belittled, told I'm beneath him, have no confidence and low self-esteem etc. He even said the stuff I was saying is what the devil says and said he wants to pray with me to which I refused. He told me to get up and hug him to which I refused but I extended my hand. He mentioned over text how the friendship was over prior to the meeting. 

I stopped seeing him and his friends along with the church people. But now I'm certain he's been ruining my rep behind my back and when he sees me he always tries to give me a fist bump saying ""what's up bro"". I always reciprocate because I dont want to show weakness since he knows about my bullying past.

To show them something new and exciting, discover something for them, be their ChatGPT in this turbulent world. 

Over the years, I felt resentment and exhaustion from trying to please them, and this caused me enormous guilt. That’s when I understood I couldn’t visit them as much and spend time there for my own sanity, so I started buying them things instead. I was thinking of this like “giving my parents the best life they could never build themselves”. Of course, this brought me even more exhaustion. I tried having some boundaries and doing the very minimum. I still was their part time unpaid problem solver though.

My ndad is an unstable alcoholic, and my mom is his apologist and enabler. One day they decided to visit me and I couldn’t say no, even though that was a Tuesday morning and I was working from home. My husband agreed to entertain them, my ndad got drunk and told him “If you were my child, I would beat the shit out of you”. My husband had suffered abuse in his childhood, so he stood firmly and said he would not let anyone talk to him that way. Ndad threw a tantrum, multiple F bombs, and messaged me that night “I don’t want anything from you anymore”. Lol.

Since Nov last year, he cut communication with me. My mom still messages me and I even met her once for coffee (out of necessity, I needed some papers from her). She behaves as if she’s doing something illegal talking to me. Of course, I’m not welcome at their home, no Christmas, Easter or other holidays (those used to be big for my ndad, as it gave him a permission to get drunk and behave like a baby).

I feel used and alone and shocked that he thinks he took away one thing that was supposed to bring me joy - serving them.

# 1. Proximity vs. Participation

* Spiritual Insight Requires Engagement: John arrives first, but only looks in from a distance. Reflecting, we can be close to a revelation but miss the deeper meaning by not entering in the experience.
* Peter's Boldness Opens the Way: Peter, though slower, enters the tomb first leading to John's further revelation. This shows how spiritual courage and action often lead to greater understanding.

# 2. Layers of Revelation

* **The** ​**Initial Glimp**​**se vs. the Full Picture**: John only sees the body wrappings at first. It’s not until he steps into the tomb that he notices the **folded face cloth**, which holds deeper meaning.
* Spiritual Growth Often Comes in Stages. This shows how our understanding deepens when we go beyond surface observations and truly immerse ourselves in the experience.

# 3. The Folded Face Cloth – Symbol of Christ’s Return

* The face cloth being folded was a delibrerate act of Jesus. A folded and separate face cloth is often interpreted as a symbol of intention and order; it meant that the master would be back.
* In ancient Jewish tradition, a folded napkin left by a master at the table meant, “I’m coming back.” Servants understood this as a sign that the master was not finished.
* This quiet symbol speaks volumes — it affirms not only that Christ has risen, but also that He will return, offering hope and reassurance to believers.M?

# 4. Personal Reflection and Application

* **Am I willing to step into the unknown for deeper truth?**
* **Do I stop at observation, or do I move into participation?**
* **Am I noticing the subtle, symbolic ways the Spirit speaks to me today?**",1,1744807677.0,TheDailyDose,0,1.0,False

This is my first post here and I'm looking for advice! I am a barista by trade, a roaster by hobby, and coffee is my career! I currently have a little, very cheap De'longhi that I got at Bed, Bath, and Beyond before it went under. It's older (around 5+ years) and it has a lot of issues. I'm in desperate need of an upgrade.

I did some research and it's all pointing to the Breville Bambino Plus. What is the consensus here? Is it a good machine especially with my little budget? 

What I am exactly looking for is a smallish machine I can pull decent shots on so I can try the notes of all the small batch roasting I do. Also I want to practice latte art and fluffing up perfect foam! ",2,1744807610.0,espresso,9,1.0,False
1k0jjnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1k0jjnk/the_church_i_am_apart_of_is_often_considered_to/,The church i am apart of is often considered to be a cult online,"Basically this is going to lead into a question, being what is the Christian church supposed to be and feel like, regarding physical church, as well as personal lives

My church has a lot of cult allegations, as the head pastor is super charismatic and often praised as a heroic figure because he is so good at what he does, and the hierarchy of the church feels incredibly steep and controlling. The weekly cell groups are also often accused of guilt tripping members to tithe and give money, or to be apart of the church's paid courses - which I have just finished the first one and it felt quite entry level, that could have been said in normal church sessions.

Another thing, one that I agree with, is that the church feels like a business and a marketing gimmick, with its own merch store, several stores for like coffee and pizza,  run and named after the church. It feels weird.

Also back to the part about the head pastor, he preaches at the main campus, while there is also a smaller church campus. Members in my cell group and in the church as a whole, often look down on you if you don't want to go to the main campus and rather opt for the smaller campus, even if its closer, as they think the head pastor is just 'that good'. They see the small campus as a backup plan, if they for some strange reason can't drive way further to the main campus, they'll just have to go to smaller campus with the pastors there.

Also, another accusation is that the church is extremely controlling over your time, wanting you at church or church events more often a week than not, like for some people its like 4 to 5 days a week it seems. People trying to leave cell groups get calls long after trying to persuade them back. It's weird

That said I am looking to move churches soon. I haven't experienced too radically weird things yet, but things are feeling a bit off. How would you all say a church should be in that sense, how much of your time should go to the church itself. Of course, i want to give as much time as possible to Jesus and God, and grow as a Christian, but this church makes it feel like you're a pawn to the church sometimes.

They think they're better than other churches, and are vocal about it. They scan you in if you go to church, track all your progress in the church online. It's strange",10,1744807604.0,Christianity,31,1.0,False

Not looking for anything dramatic or life-changing — just a soft space to read, write, and share with someone who enjoys thoughtful exchanges. If you’re into journaling, yoga, solo travel, or have a soft spot for soulful music, we might just vibe.

I am best described as a goth who has a love of the subculture and music 

I enjoy cooking and baked goods, I haven't baked in a long time since I was a kid and would love to meet a girl who likes to bake.

My sense of fashion falls more into gothic fashion but I enjoy a sense of style from the partner I am with but would still enjoy dating someone dressed in their pajamas.

I also enjoy quiet time with reading books and sipping on coffee at a cafe, I enjoy cafe hopping and visiting different coffee shops.

As for physical activities I like to run and build up my cardio and weight lifting and am planning to take on martial arts with local schools that teach it.

When it comes to spirituality I am an open book who keeps their mind open to the paranormal but am not practicing any religion.

I also attend conventions and art shows as often as I can and enjoy dancing and love to go out to clubs and any event and to make friends with the people there and to network.

1k0jcos,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1k0jcos/hey_there_delilah/,Hey There Delilah,"Sack, 

Our story starts when we met in 7th grade. I can’t remember the first class we had together but that was probably because I was turned around drawing with pens and markers on your hand and forearms for most of the period. You had your blonde hair with the shaggy emo cut; always wearing your beanie and your brown eyes. 🤎 (2012-2013) 

You and I spent so much time together after we met. Through 8th and 9th grade we grew closer not that it was hard in our singular hallway, charter school. We had our other two buddies K.B. and P.T. always goofing off. I would be laughing so hard I’d turn beet red. 

We were hellions. Remember the times you and P.W. would axe bomb the hallway between classes when we all were packed together like sardines? Or when you guys were doing backflips off the cement benches and I was taking pictures of it for “action shots” I needed for photography class. K.B. and I always showing up late to the class we both hated with gas station ice coffee and a doughnut just to rub it in. We were all in our own world together. 

Every day you, and I would meet after school in our spot by the bathrooms; chatting for hours some days with P.T. and K.B My head always planted in your lap. I really miss those times a lot. We were both so innocent at the time. 

On the days you had guitar class (even though you preferred learning tabs on your own) after school, any chance I got I would ask you to play me Hey There Delilah. You knew some Metallica too but I didn’t know them as much back then. You were always too shy to sing along as you played. But I loved it. I still hope I can one day hear you sing. 

I dated S.W. at one point and that was my first “relationship” I think I just liked his attention and when him and I ended, I was hurt and vengeful. That’s when I dated you for a week to make him jealous and it worked. I know we were just kids in middle school, and I’ve apologized before but again, I’m sorry. Because that was the first time I know I hurt you. You didn’t speak to me for a little and I felt it. 

I don’t know when we found out we lived just down the street from each other (my dads, your moms houses) but it was insane to me at the time considering our parents houses were in WJ (city) and our school was pretty far from that. What are the odds? That I think is the first time I noticed the synchronicity’s between us two.

After we left for separate high schools we didn’t talk as much. I lived at my mom’s, my dad got remarried and he moved into an apartment with her; you were on the other side of the valley. I thought our worlds got separated and I moved on with my life. 

But at one point we reconnected. We went hiking with my step sister. That time is a blur, home life was crazy and so was my mental state. Such a small blip but I remember being so happy to be with you. 

I know we talked on my 16th birthday. You sent me a snap wishing me a happy birthday; I have it saved. So from May 2016 through the summer before our senior year of high school I started technical college for cosmetology. Come to find out the girl you were dating at the time was in my class. She always looked at me sideways even though I had never seen her before. All of your girlfriends hate me no matter how little I talk to you, no matter the context. 

After high school I started dating a guy for about a year and a half and he had me so brainwashed and insecure I did whatever would please him and I cut contact with every man other than family and him. Not proud of it but it is what it is. 

Then the next time I heard from you was after I left my ex and was living with B.S. and her and I were both depressed and would drink and cry all night and sleep all day. I started a new job and got fired for my absence. I messaged you, to catch up on where life had taken us. You were dating your ex S. at the time. I hated that she was always so disloyal to you. Your relationship was in shambles and I tried to get in the middle and was being promiscuous and crossing lines I shouldn’t have. 

Not too long later we realized that for the second time we lived down the street from each other’s apartments in C.H.(city) when you still lived with S. with your two cats. (2020-2021) 

When you and S. broke up we started hanging out together again. We met up at the skate park and it felt like no time passed. (April 22, 2021)

Then there was the time I drove us to the bar and I got too drunk to drive us home and so did you. We walked to the lake to talk and pass time so we could sober up. It was dark out so I decided to get naked to skinny dip and was trying to convince you to come with me only to have two strangers walk by on the trail that ran along the lakeside. You were facing the lake and I was facing you standing about ankle deep in the lake water when they walked by. I ran up to you so fast burying myself in your chest and arms fumbling trying to get my pants back on you kept me stable and blocked me from their sight the best you could. You always make me feel safe. When I’m with you it feels like I’m in a movie. (July 14, 2021) we laughed after the people were gone and it was just us two again.

We spent so much time together that summer, and so on. We ended up sleeping together, and I don’t know why I got so in my head about it and decided to push you away, but I did. The commitment scared me. Maybe the mommy or daddy issues, past relationships, but they’re still not to blame for the way I treated you. I apologize for the pain i caused when you told me how you felt and I brushed you off. It was f**ked up of me. I was so scared to ruin what we had. I didn’t want to lose you if we ended badly so I avoided it all together. (Hindsight is 20/20) I’ve gone back and read through bits of our chats in snap going back to 2016 and there are so many times I’ve told you how I felt about you and it’s always been when I’m alone (shocker) but when you’ve burned bridges and climbed mountains to get close to me I’ve ended up pulling away. 

Because of my lack of consistency and lack of trust in myself and my feelings I hurt you to the point where there’s even times you’ve pulled back from us out of fear because of the pain I put you through in the past. 

I bet for you it’s felt like the story about the boy who cried wolf when youve hesitated to trust the love I say I have for you. I’ve given you every reason to not trust my words.

Soon after you confessed your feelings and I pushed them away you her (H.S.) I really was rooting for the both of you because I didn’t want to confront the hurt you felt because I knew I caused it. I didn’t know what to say. So I became your wingman out of my own self sabotage. (Not a first)

Was this the first night I met her? 
You, H.S., our other friend M.E., and I went to a house party where M.E. was living with his new roommates at the time. He was so hyped. Haha, trap house vibe for sure. We played beer pong in that designated empty bedroom with dirty ass carpet from soaked up beer and whatever else. We all signed our names on that huge canvas that hung in the living room and we took a pic all together in the “infamous” blue bathroom. (July 8, 2022) 

You and her started getting more serious, made it official. We were still friends but I felt the distance growing and I just f**king sat there with it and willingly handed you over to someone else. I drove from my dads to your moms to see if you were home and I saw M.E. just pulled his car into your driveway so I parked and went inside with him so (respectfully) the three of us could hang out. 
Wrong of me to assume it would be fine to hangout since M.E. Was there too and not just us two alone. 

You sent a text to H.S. to let her know I was over at yours hanging out with you and M.E., then you got real quiet… H.S. did not like that I was over there at all. You told us what she said or something along the lines of what her message read. I can’t remember what it was exactly enough to quote. 
But regardless of what it was she said I respected her acknowledged her feelings when she felt uncomfortable with me being there. 

Why the hell did I empathize with her feelings even when I disagreed with it but ignored all the feelings you’ve had for me all these years. Why was I such an ass, and I didn’t even realize what I did until it was too late.

After hearing what she had said about me being there I stood up and looked at you and told you it was okay; and I told you I understood. In reality I didn’t understand the gravity of my decision to push you away. I said my goodbyes and left. Next thing I knew I was blocked across socials and whatever else. That’s when I noticed the weight your absence had on me. (September 1, 2022) 

You’re a Pisces, emotional and we’ve had our arguments in our past so it wasn’t the first time you’ve blocked me. But it shocks me still every time you leave in silence, not a peep. I always thought we’ve know each other long enough to wish a ‘goodbye’ or “see you later”. But even if you explained it to me in every language there was no getting across to me. You know me, stubborn Taurus. 

I know H.S. still despises me and that’s why I’m still not allowed to be your friend. That’s what manipulators do. They isolate you from all your friends, even M.E. got the brunt of it when H.S. decided to accuse him of stealing your guitar in a group chat M.E. was a part of in the mental health community. It backfired on H.S. when the group kicked her out instead of M.E. Has she already pushed out all the friends you had before her?

I was working at my dad’s when you sent me a message saying “Hey I just wanted to text you and let you know we’re pregnant :)” and I felt so hurt, not because she was pregnant, but because you sent that message only 17 days after cutting off all communication you had with me. I was petty and I replied, “so can we be friends again?” and yeah I know, horrible timing, very inconsiderate and unsupportive; But hearing from you so soon with news as life altering as a child so fast. I was heartbroken, you poured salt into my open wounds. 
I started grieving our friendship because I thought that was the end of us. I was working so much to drown out or push down my emotions. Complete self destruction. (September 18, 2022) 

When I saw pictures of your son after he was born, I bawled. I wasn’t sad this time looking and you and your son. because how precious and beautiful is seeing him and the way you look at him. Seeing you being a dad is something I hold so close to my heart.

Time goes by and you message me and you asked me if I was going to the concert you were working and I told you I couldn’t afford it at the time. (I’m still dying to see the band to this day.) You told me she broke up with you. You were begging her to let you be in your son’s life and she was kicking you while you were down sending message after message her just talking down on you and degrading you. So I told you to call me and you told me to give you an hour to call me after you left work around 11:00pm; I agreed. 11:00pm came and passed. I sent a text a half hour later asking if you were home… no response. The next day I tried to send another message, the once blue bubble was green. Blocked, again. You stayed with her. I know it’s for your son but she has you in shackles. You’re her hostage. You don’t have to live with that. 
(October 16, 2022 - the day I asked you “are you home?”) 

There’s been other times we’ve talked over the last few years but never more than a conversation that lasts a day or two and then I’m unfriended, unfollowed, unadded, and blocked; over and over. Just our feelings going around and around the carousel never getting off. neither of us will ever fully let go, right? 

In the time we’ve been estranged I’ve gone to college, had a few short lived relationships, got pregnant and had my daughter and it’s been 9 months of just her and I (her dads not in the picture)  

I always have so many things I want to say to you but I hold back because you’re still with her. Whenever we end up talking again It’s always such small talk and I hate it. I feel like the tension between our past and present with the obvious feelings we’ve always kept tucked away starts suffocating us until we have nothing “small” left to say and you block me in the night while I sleep. Because we both know if we talk any more one of us is going to slip. Will we ever mention the elephant we’ve kept in the room with us for 13 years now and finally come together? For good this time? 

On April 9th I talked to M.E. I told him the feelings I have for you and how much I love you. Spilled my guts. He said, “Was not expecting that but I love that for you and I wish you guys were together not that crazy lady!!!!” “You are perfect for him” “You were the one” and all of those things make me grin ear to ear but none of the things he said have any meaning unless you also still have feelings for me.

April 10th the word vomit in our snap started… 
I couldn’t hold it anymore. You’re always on my mind. This is one message I sent to him, “Sack, I feel like we are each other’s person. I always move on and we have been caught in crossroads so many times but I’ve noticed that any time I’m alone and with myself I think about you all the time. Sure it could be because we’ve known each other forever but I can’t help but feel like all of my roads I choose lead me back to you.”

April 13, 2025 My message was still sitting unopened. I got bummed about it because I’ve been sitting with my feelings so long so I was drinking a bit and I sent another couple messages; the first saying, “Ima drunk text you rn, okay? I was reading through old text messages of ours and I can’t stop laughing then crying because you’re my favorite person and you make me smile a lot. I miss you so much. When I think about you I just feel like a part of me is missing. Ugh I wanna hug you for like 5 years oml.” 

The last message I sent was, “I never should have let you go (I’m so happy we have our babies) but if I get the chance to have you back I won’t fuck it up this time. I love you Sack. I don’t know how I’ve been so blind all this time. I’m sorry for everything I’ve put you thru” and at this point it was about 6:30am and I finally fell asleep.

I woke up the following afternoon, I saw he sent me a message back but he deleted it; and it case you couldn’t guess it… I’m blocked. I want to know what he said so bad. I want to know what he feels. 

Now it’s April 16, 2025. This has been our story. 
Is this just the end of a chapter? The cliff hanger at our bookend? Is there more to our story?

If I ever get the chance, will you play me Hey There Delilah? I love you Sack. 

- yours truly, Teef

1k0jb2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1k0jb2x/got_told_just_eat_more_fibre_for_10_years_turns/,Got told “just eat more fibre” for 10 years. Turns out it was IBS-C,"Yesterday I finally had an appointment with a gastroenterologist and got told I have IBS-C (and probably some allergies that I’ve been referred to further testing for). 

I FEEL SO VALIDATED. 

I stopped bringing up the issue at regular doctors’ appointments, stopped mentioning it to family and close friends, even convinced myself that it was all somehow my fault. Why? Because the answer was always one of the following:
* Just eat more fibre! (Sometimes even when they knew that 95% of my protein intake was from beans)
* Just drink more water! (I have over 2L a day)
* “If you went vegan you’d never be constipated.” (As mentioned before, I was already 95% vegan. So special F U to these people.)
* Just eat oatmeal/psyllium husk or drink senna tea/coffee! (I have oatmeal with ground flaxseed every morning and senna tea does absolutely NOTHING for me. Coffee also does nothing for my gut motility, but it gives me panic attacks.)
* Just exercise more/ sleep more/ eat more… I am a highly active person who has no issues with sleep or eating enough. Come on. 

I am processing so many emotions now… For almost half of my life, my gut complaints have been met with these unhelpful, unsolicited and dismissive comments. Looking back, I can see the toll it took on my mental health. I’m angry, relieved, confused, and tired all at the same time. 

I’m hoping that with the workup of medications the doctor prescribed me, I’ll finally be able to manage my constipation once and for all. Maybe then I’ll be able to properly feel and communicate with my gut again (I can go days without a bowel movement and experience abdominal pain without any sense of “fullness”. My bowel is just numb at this point.)

But last night we talked, for reference she’s on of the most emotionally intelligent people I’ve met. We came to realize that in our relationship her and I lost our identity’s.

I felt bothered when she asked me to come cuddle early in the morning when I wanted just a moment alone with a cup of coffee. I felt un attracted to her and it was a chore when it came time to intimacy. I longed for the early stages when I couldn’t wait to see her and I loved coming home to her.

I laid it all out in our conversation last night how I had ideas to leave even though she was an incredible person. In these honest but hard talks we realized there was a loss in the things we did alone and how there was a creation of dependency on her part. She even said she exhibited the same toxic traits as her ex and needed a sense of control subconsciously. It’s not a problem solved immediately kind of thing, but I’m glad we can go on this journey of understanding and I can lift this weight off my shoulder 

In summary: my gf had unintentionally smothered me which was the reason why I felt the need to leave/ not like her as much. Time to work on ourselves should solve things

Ive read one or two treads about this already but can't seem to get a good conclusion, I'm at the beginning of my research phase.
My current issue is that my mouse (G Pro Superlight) recently started acting out with double clicking issues so I can't drag &drop stuff anymore at all. Tried blowing dust out of it a few times but it didn't help. I'm not well versed in terms of soldering and stuff, else I would try to replace the switches. The mouse is slightly oder than 2 years I think, would need to check when exactly I bought it doesn't have any warranty anymore.
While I'm here to ask for advice for a new mouse, do you think Logitech would care for a replacement or something like that? Because when I bought it it was like 120€ or something, which is quite a lot for it to double click after 2-3 years.
Or your opinions of repair coffee shops? Maybe they can help me for a cheap price, cause if repairs cost too much I might as well buy a new mouse, right? But I don't want to spend much because In reality I'm broke.
Because I very much like my g pro Superlight, as I already loved the G Pro which got replaced because of the same issue...
That's why Im looking for hot recommendations on similair mice that hopefully not cripple itself after 2 years of permanent use. Which sounds very hard now that I say it. 
Also I'm quite picky, I like the simple design of the g pro, and don't like the ergonomic design from mice like the g502x.
Anyone willing to help? Thanks in advance and happy Easter everybody.

My family will be going to Guatemala for around 8 days. We will be at San Pedro for the first 4 and Antigua for the next 4. We are a family of 6, so we have elderly and children in our family. A lot of the activities I see suggested (e.g. Acatenango Hike) would not work out well for my family just due to the general differences in physical capability. I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions for activities to do in San Pedro (Lake Atitlan in general) and Antigua. I have also made a general itinerary, but don't know if it works for a family like mine. If anyone has any experiences here and could lmk if this works, it would be amazing!

Here is what I was thinking in general for my family:  
**Lake Atitlan**

Half Day 1 - Arrive at San Pedro, Walk around city + Parque Puerta Hermosa

Day 2 - Indian Summit Hike + San Juan Walk + Mirador Plaza Maravilla

Day 3 - San Marcos Nature Reserve + Afternoon explore Santiago 

Day 4 - Pajanachel

  
**Antigua** 

Day 1 - Arrive + Walking Tour of City 

Day 2- Coffee Farm Tour + Chocolate Farm Tour

Day 3 - Hobbitenango

Day 4 - Explore City + Pacaya Volcano Hike",1,1744806183.0,travel,4,1.0,False

1k0j232,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k0j232,My Cozy Retro Setup,"I've been building this up for years and now it's (mostly) complete! I've been trying to make my gaming setup as clean, compact and efficient but still able to play everything everywhere I want to. JVC BM-H131OSU, with everything but the Xbox connected via Scart(Wii component) on an Otaku switch(with the spillover connected via a Belkin switch), sent to the PVM then out to the OSSC. All housed in this cool retro TV cabinet my fiance found and got me. I put speakers underneath and cut a small hole to control from the front to retain the classic TV cabinet usage. From there, a thin HDMI cable runs under my couch meeting up with the elgato, which is connected to a docking station, which also runs my mic, mouse, second monitor, sometimes webcam. My PC is on the other side of the room so a single 10ft USB c cable carries the signal. The HDMI switch lets me use the small Oled monitor on the coffee table as either direct feed from the elgato or as a second monitor. This can all be buttoned up cleanly and is very discreet.

Console mods(I've all installed myself)
 N64 RGB 

Genesis Triple Bypass

Dreamcast GDEMU(w/ resistors + battery mod) 

TSOP Flashed Xbox with Cerbios and 500gb SSD 

PS1 with X station 

Saturn with Satiator 

GameCube FlippyDrive 

PS2 and Wii softmodded

What's left? Well I'd love to not be using that cheapo Belkin switch(although I cut the 5&12v traces to prevent voltage back feed) so an SVS is somewhere down the line but it's so expensive. I also really want an RGB modded Famicom but that's also a huge undertaking. Feel free to make fun of the slight wirenest, I've done my best but it's not perfect.

It seem that a lot of them would rather chase after someone who was half-intersted in them but would gave them just crumbs of attention and they would feast on that. On the other hand they would completely ignore or not even consider themselves dating someone who showed genuin interest in them. Well for the first time in my life, I found myself emotionally unavailable and experiencing what it's like when you ""detached"" yourself from others.

I (M22) just came out of a really exhausting situationship. I was very into the guy, but unfortunately, the feeling wasn’t mutual in the way I had hoped. I ended up having to walk away on my own, which was a tough mental experience. On top of that, it's my final year of studies and I have to write my thesis, all while dealing with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. It’s been mentally draining. I just decided to focus on myself, my studies, and my friendships and stop dating and hookups all together.

And suddenly, out of nowhere, the number of guys who started showing interest in me skyrocketed. I didn’t change anything about my appearance, but former hookups or dates who barely cared about me before suddenly started harassing me to meet up. When I told them I wasn’t in a good mental space, they would still try to cling to whatever little attention I gave them. Some former hookups asked to grab a coffee, cuddle, or even just take a walk in the forest. Even when I barely responded, they kept coming back.

Case in point: there was this cute guy from Instagram who wanted to meet. I told him I wasn’t in a good place and that it wouldn’t lead anywhere. But he insisted on getting a beer, and I eventually caved just to give it a shot. He was nice and funny, but I spent most of the date feeling weird and annoyed, even catching myself thinking about my former crush. I was ready to leave it at that, but he kept reaching out, asking to meet again. I kept telling him he should go after someone who’s in a better mental space, but he kept fighting for scraps of my attention, DMing me just to go on a walk.

It’s not even flattering anymore. It just feels uncanny how so many people are chasing someone who clearly isn’t emotionally available, instead of going after someone who’s actually on the same page. It's like the more cold and distant you act with a guy, the harder they are willing to try.",14,1744805927.0,askgaybros,10,1.0,False

I've worked at Starbucks for almost a year and everything has already changed. Even just the ~vibes~. They want us to quit. Specifically, the higher ups want people who have worked at Starbucks for 3+ years to quit. They want to weed out the people making the most. The people who loved Starbucks a certain way. Already at my store so many people have quit. I truly think the dress code is only a small piece to this, I don't think any of the newer baristas care about dress code, I know I don't, but the people who have been here a while do, they don't want change, which in a lot of ways is reasonable. What threw me over the edge is writing on the cups, it's ridiculous, I know. However, we were just told if we don't write on every cup, we get written up. I have resigned myself to just taking longer, let the company suffer over times, they make it impossible to keep them down. Taking out a sharpie, uncapping it, writing something, recapping, putting away sharpie; that's at least 15 seconds a drink, which distracts from EVERYTHING. Customers get angry watching me write on every cup because they just want to get their coffee NOW. So I get screamed at over what? ""Enjoy"". It's exhausting. morale is at an all time low and everyone wants out. I love Starbucks I do, I'm just trying to wait out this period of purging employees, but I do not want to see experienced baristas get burnt out and leave. It's very disheartening. Stick it out y'all! They want you to leave so they can replace you with cheaper labor. Why not rid of the employees making 25 an hour for new ones who only make 15? It's cost cutting, and once they get what they want, it will settle, drive times will go back to the forefront, and we can all live in harmony again . . . I hope.

# Tactical Soap: 2025's Best Bar? (Review)

The ""tactical soap"" market has exploded in recent years, catering to outdoor enthusiasts, military personnel, and anyone who appreciates a rugged, high-performance cleansing experience. These aren't your grandma's perfumed bars; they're designed to be durable, effective in challenging environments, and often packed with features like exfoliating properties and odor-neutralizing capabilities. In this review, we鈥檒l dive deep into what makes a tactical soap stand out, evaluating its features, benefits, and how it stacks up against the competition to determine if it's the best choice for 2025.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The Tactical Soap being reviewed boasts several features that set it apart in a crowded marketplace. From its composition to its packaging, every detail seems carefully considered for optimal performance in demanding situations.

**Antimicrobial Formulation**

This tactical soap is formulated with a powerful blend of antimicrobial ingredients, including tea tree oil and activated charcoal. These components work synergistically to kill bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms that can thrive in outdoor environments or after strenuous physical activity. The antimicrobial properties help prevent skin infections, reduce body odor, and promote overall hygiene.

**Exfoliating Grit**

Embedded within the soap is a carefully calibrated amount of exfoliating grit, derived from natural sources such as finely ground pumice stone or coffee grounds. This grit provides a gentle yet effective scrubbing action, removing dead skin cells, dirt, and grime. Regular exfoliation helps to unclog pores, prevent ingrown hairs, and improve skin texture, leaving the skin feeling smoother and more refreshed.

**Odor-Neutralizing Technology**

One of the key features of this tactical soap is its advanced odor-neutralizing technology. It contains ingredients that bind to and neutralize odor-causing molecules, rather than simply masking them with fragrance. This is particularly beneficial for individuals who engage in activities that lead to heavy sweating or exposure to strong odors, such as hiking, camping, or working in industrial settings.

**Long-Lasting Durability**

Unlike conventional soaps that quickly dissolve or become mushy in wet conditions, this tactical soap is designed for exceptional durability. It is formulated with a dense, hard-milled base that resists melting and maintains its shape even after repeated use. This ensures that the soap lasts significantly longer, providing more value for the money.

**Compact and Portable Design**

The tactical soap is designed with portability in mind. Its compact size and shape make it easy to pack in a backpack, duffel bag, or survival kit. Some versions even come with a convenient travel container or lanyard for easy storage and access. The soap's rugged construction also makes it resistant to damage during transport.

**All-Natural Ingredients**

This tactical soap prides itself on using all-natural ingredients, avoiding harsh chemicals, artificial fragrances, and synthetic dyes. It is formulated with plant-based oils, essential oils, and botanical extracts that are gentle on the skin and environmentally friendly. This makes it a suitable choice for individuals with sensitive skin or those who prefer natural personal care products.

 ## Core Benefits

This tactical soap isn't just about cleaning; it's about providing real benefits that enhance the user's experience, especially in challenging environments.

**Enhanced Hygiene in the Field:** The antimicrobial formulation ensures thorough cleansing, reducing the risk of infections and maintaining skin health when access to regular showers is limited. Imagine a multi-day hiking trip where you can confidently clean your skin and prevent breakouts, thanks to the soap's powerful cleansing action.

**Effective Odor Control:** The odor-neutralizing technology eliminates even the toughest smells, keeping you feeling fresh and confident in any situation. Picture returning from a strenuous workout or a long day outdoors and being able to quickly and effectively eliminate body odor, without relying on heavy perfumes or masking agents.

**Improved Skin Health:** The exfoliating properties promote healthy skin turnover, preventing clogged pores and leaving skin feeling smooth and revitalized. Envision using the soap after a day of working in the garden and effectively removing dirt and grime, while simultaneously exfoliating dead skin cells to reveal smoother, healthier skin.

**Cost-Effective Solution:** The long-lasting durability ensures that one bar of tactical soap can replace multiple bars of conventional soap, saving you money in the long run. Think about how often you need to replace regular soap bars versus how much longer a tactical soap bar lasts, resulting in significant savings over time.

**Versatile Use:** From camping trips to daily showers, this soap is suitable for a wide range of activities and environments. Consider using it as a daily cleanser in your shower, knowing that it's gentle enough for regular use but powerful enough to tackle tough dirt and grime.

 ## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions about tactical soap can help potential buyers make informed decisions.

**Is tactical soap suitable for sensitive skin?**

While many tactical soaps are formulated with natural ingredients and are generally gentle, it's essential to check the ingredient list for potential allergens or irritants. If you have sensitive skin, opt for a soap that is specifically labeled as hypoallergenic or fragrance-free. Always test a small area of skin before using it all over your body.

**How long does a bar of tactical soap typically last?**

The lifespan of a tactical soap bar depends on factors such as frequency of use, water temperature, and storage conditions. However, due to its dense formulation, a bar of tactical soap generally lasts significantly longer than a conventional soap bar 鈥?often two to three times as long.

**Can tactical soap be used on hair?**

While some tactical soaps may be used on hair, it's not always recommended. The ingredients that make tactical soap effective for body cleansing, such as exfoliating grit or strong antimicrobial agents, can be harsh on the scalp and hair. It's best to use a dedicated shampoo for hair washing.

**Does tactical soap have a strong scent?**

The scent of tactical soap varies depending on the specific formulation. Some soaps are fragrance-free, while others are infused with essential oils or natural fragrances. The scent is typically subtle and not overpowering, designed to be pleasant without being distracting.

I (M28) have been working at this company in Manila for around 6 months now, and since day one, I’ve had a quiet crush on a coworker (F29) from another department. We don’t really interact much—just the very occasional “good morning” or polite nod in the hallway. She’s on the reserved side, which makes it even harder for me to find an opening.

I really want to get to know her better, but I don’t want to come off as weird or make her uncomfortable, especially since we work in the same company. I was thinking of maybe starting with small talk or asking her out for coffee or something, but I feel like I need to build a bit more rapport first.

--

An older OOTD pre-haircut, but I absolutely love theming my outfits. Traditionally, Japanese workers wore Tabi socks with geta sandals. In the 1930's, that switched to a rubberized Tabi shoe. These cargos are themed off Japanese Tobi balloon cargo pants, which typically would be worn with tabis as well. Most workers typically wear warmer fleeces with vests for mobility in the cold months, and the beanie felt fisherman-y so I said why not?

The goal is to have fun. Do people sometimes dislike tabis? Of coarse haha. But those who understand the history usually give me nice comments when I'm out and about. As a Japanese speaker, and someone who visits the country each year, I love adding in a bit of history into each of my outfits. Again, mostly secondhand, minus the beanie (which is pretty cheap) and the vest is from my friend Merv, who runs Okayama Denim.
