1hzhyd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1hzhyd1/is_it_really_fibromyalgia_and_other_questions_ive/,is it really fibromyalgia? (and other questions i've been asking myself),"hello, guys. i don't often post to reddit but my chronic pain has been worse than usual lately and it's been making me feel very alone, so i figure it might be good for me to talk to some other folks going through similar pains. this is a bit of a long read, so strap in. it turned into more of an essay than i was expecting.

i'm 21 years old, and my body began to fail me at 17, only a few months into my first year of university & very first job, back in 2021.

the pain started in my feet and ankles, which i attributed to standing all day at starbucks, where i worked. my coworkers told me it would get better once i got used to it, and i even got the shoes they recommended. but it didn't. the pain spread to the rest of my legs, and around the same time, i began experiencing chronic vomiting as well. the latter, i later learned was gallbladder dysfunction, and had my gallbladder removed, resulting in significantly less vomiting but far more trips to the toilet. around this time my vision also started to weaken, which led to me getting my first pair of glasses. my pain, however, was not so easily solved. it began to occupy more of my time, more of my life. i was fired from my first job, spent a summer getting worse while i scraped by on my financial aid, and then attempted to get a new job at walgreens. i lasted a week before i was fired for having panic attacks on the clock and having to take frequent breaks to sit down throughout my eight hour shifts. i then got a rather decent job at a coffee shop on campus, which had a *very* lovely manager that was very accommodating for my pain, letting me work shorter shifts and doing less heavy lifting, and even allowing me to have one earbud in to manage my anxiety. unfortunately, only a few months later, i was kicked out of university for being behind on payments. my financial aid wasn't raised when they raised tuition and housing fees, so my excess of aid had turned into a deficit. so, i packed up my apartment, and i drove across the country to move in with my grandparents.

since then, i've been seeing doctors, applying for disability, trying medication after medication, getting denied disability, and being largely dismissed due to my weight (which i gained most of *after* my pain began, but the doctors don't seem to believe me). i use cannabis pretty much every single day just to get by, and i'm on an array of medications that makes me exhausted just to think about.

to top it off: just a few months ago, my boyfriend broke up with me and my best friend of nearly ten years cut me off. they simply could not deal with my mental and physical problems anymore. i don't really blame them for it, though i am still grieving.

honestly it feels like i'm grieving *all the time* because of my chronic pain. i just have this constant, unrelenting grief for the life i could be living right now if i wasn't in so much pain.

in any case, i'm now in a rather lonely position, and my pain has only been getting worse. i'm also now struggling with a combination of allergies and asthma, it would seem, which have additionally made me feel like i've had a bad cold since september. just another thing to worry about‚Äîexactly what i needed.

there are a lot of questions i've been pondering in my lonely hours, spent hazy and fatigued as i try to find something fulfilling to do on my computer, or work on my crochet when my hands don't hurt too much.

* do i actually have fibromyalgia, or do my doctors just not care enough to look further? i got blood test after blood test with little to show for it but my elevated cholesterol (who knew being on food stamps + being in too much pain to cook most days + that autistic sensitivity in me would lead to a pretty terrible diet?) and fatty liver. none of which explains the level of constant, all-over musculoskeletal pain. i saw a specialist, who did a short physical exam on me, diagnosed me with fibromyalgia, seemed skeptical about my use of a wheelchair (which i only use when i'm in significant pain and have to travel a longer distance than i'm capable of), and told me to lose weight & exercise. after that, i've just been trialing new medications meant to treat fibromyalgia. but none of them are working.
* is it worth applying for disability again? i live in the united states‚Äîthere's no guarantee i'll ever be approved and the process is *exhausting*. i had to admit myself into inpatient psychiatric care shortly after receiving my first denial two years ago, and i don't want to go through that mental pain again.
* will i ever be able to live on my own again? i so rarely find the energy to do personal hygiene, much less the bare minimum daily housework of even the smallest apartments.
* do i have any hope of leaving the united states, as a transgender man that may soon be forced to detransition in the case of a nationwide hormone therapy ban? (this will also inevitably lead to my menstrual cycle returning, and along with it my endometriosis, which has been in remission since i started testosterone)
* is there any chance my dream of becoming a pilot will ever come true, when i'm in this state? is there any way i could even be a barista, the ""backup plan"" i thought i could always count on? even if there were some accommodation, my fatigue and brain fog kill all other potential job opportunities i could do despite the pain.

there are....certainly a lot more than this. but these are the major questions on my mind lately. and mind you, i'm not expecting answers from you guys. i know these are all questions that can't be answered in a reddit post, and certainly not by a stranger.

*phew*, this has turned into more of an essay than anything else. it's been a while since i've had the space to fully air all of this out. i don't need any answers from y'all, but i'd certainly appreciate some company in my pain. i just want to know i'm not alone in this. the pain, the never-ending grief for the life you could be living, the isolation, the stress. it's just....a lot. *and* i'll never say no to advice and resources, of course.

i hope you guys are doing well‚Äîat least, as well as we can all hope to be. if you've read this far, take a sip of water. don't forget to take your meds. and you *do* deserve that little treat you've been craving. take your little moments of joy when you can get them.

I bumped into him earlier in the week and we agreed to catch up over coffee on Thursday afternoon during our lunch break. He made a calendar event for it. 

Thursday rolls around, and I send him a message to check if the plans were still on. Nothing.

Given his history with depression and insomnia, I decide to put my pride aside and message his roommate (a mutual friend) on Friday morning to check if he was okay. 

The roommate came back to me said that Mike fine and asked why I was concerned. He mentioned that on Thursday afternoon that Mike made a remark saying ‚ÄúShoot, I forgot about coffee with OP today‚Äù. 

Mike only messaged me to apologise on Friday after he knew I contacted his roommate to save face - he didn‚Äôt message me after he ‚Äòrealised‚Äô he had forgotten later on Thursday afternoon (as his roommate suggests). 

I find it hard to believe he forgot given I messaged earlier in the day to confirm, and Mike is in sales so he is chronically online.

I realised the only time he wants to see me is when he wants something so I‚Äôve decided to cut him off after this. 

TL;DR Friend stands me up for coffee and only apologises when shared friend asks him about it. Tries to mend damage with song suggestions??

It was early 2010s, so long after his time in office, in a London hotel near the US embassy, and we got a booking for President Carter for a couple of nights, with a very specific sheet of instructions regarding room placement, security etc. There was also going to be a room for the Secret Service. 

Amongst all the things requested was a traditional coffee machine (not like a capsule one), so my FOM at the time sent me to a nearby department store to buy a new, fancy machine, rather than use one of the ones we had in stock. Only the best etc. Before I went, I also had a look through the list, and it kind of read to me as though the coffee machine was meant to be placed on the Secret Service's room, but my FOM dismissed my comment, saying it was obviously for the President. 

So off I went shopping, and we set up everything. Before arrival, someone from the Embassy and the Secret Service came to check things, and when they saw the coffee machine, they went 'oh, this would be great for us, the president actually only drinks tea, do you mind if we move this over to our room?'

So there you go, read your spec sheets! 

I also remember a few of us hovering on the lobby, fussing over the faulty elevator, shortly before Carter was due to get back to the hotel on one of his days. One of his entourage was sitting in the lobby and dryly said ""you know Carter's an engineer, he could probably help you with that"". I then also got to be a human door stop and holding the door open as he finally did get back - definitely the closest I'll get to any US president any time soon!

I (19M), we recently moved into a new apartment, and my married neighbor,(29F), was super friendly from the start. She brought us a welcome basket, offered to show me around, and even helped me with a couple of things when I was settling in. It felt nice to have someone nearby who was so helpful.

But over the past few weeks, she has developed a habit of letting herself into my apartment without knocking. The first time, she came in to drop off some parcel that was accidentally delivered to her. I thought it was a little strange, but I let it go because she seemed genuinely kind.

Then it started happening more often. She‚Äôs walked in while I was gaming, napping, and even once when I was half-dressed after a shower. Every time, she‚Äôd act like it was totally normal, saying things like, ‚ÄúOh, I just wanted to see if you needed anything,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI had an extra coffee and thought you might like it.‚Äù

Finally, I decided to talk to her about it. I politely asked her to knock before coming over, explaining that I value my privacy and feel uncomfortable when people come in unannounced.She looked surprised and a bit hurt, saying, ‚ÄúI was just trying to be nice! Most people would appreciate someone looking out for them.‚Äù

Now things feel awkward between us. Some friends think I overreacted and should‚Äôve just been grateful for her kindness. Others say I did the right thing and that her behavior was inappropriate, no matter how nice her intentions were.

On the dramatic side of it (justified at the time, rejection after rejection) I asked myself most weeks, will I ever work in my field again. Not news here but it's a terrible terrible market and has been for years. On the lighter side I found myself whether delusional or not, telling family and friends when they enquired how I was going - that I'm just going through the motions and tackling one day at a time, rolling with the punches, as they were punches one after the next after the next. 

I wanted to post this as a reminder to those that are finding it really tough at the moment and to those that are losing and have lost faith to try and stay above water, the darkness and hopelessness will come to pass. 

These are my take aways from my own journey, much of it would have been posted before but I hope some of it helps / resonates and ultimately I want to say we feel the pain you do and hopelessness that you're going through. 

You aren't alone - this is a beautiful community and I have found much solace in reddit over the last year+ for providing light hearted perspectives as well as particularly this sub that the world is very fucked and from the sub perspective/s, there are many horror stories, some hilarious, others atrocious. 

Some of these lessons are obvious, some may need reminding:

***** Market / Realities / Money *****

1 - this job market is truly fucked (it's not you, it's global, every market) you are not alone. 

2 - if you spend all day every day thinking about how bad it is and your lack of role it will crush you, you have to take a break so you don't overwhelm yourself because it is very hard otherwise. I've gone through bouts of depression, it is normal but don't sit in it for too long. Get out and get some fresh air or sunshine (VD) or even see a mate, break up the darkness in any way you can so it's not constant. Being out among people, even sitting in a cafe or in a park does help. 

3 - if you can, get a part time job, hospitality is a good and honest industry (I went back to making coffee). Whilst it's not related to my formal qualifications, it has given me some walking around money and you're around people - this was probably the single biggest thing that kept me above water mentally for my year of hell. Breaking up your corp applications (if applicable) with some other maybe non related work helps you take your mind of the endless self worth internal thought track and puts some space between the mental gymnastics of actually doing an application and working. 

   There are many people who think just because they went to university and got a degree in x means they never again have to drop back into a services industry or work that shit dead end job to make ends meet, should times get tough. Do what you need to do to get by and fuck anyone that looks down on you or judges you for this, I dealt with this bullshit from folks within my friendship group and community and I don't have time for those people anymore, kicking me when I'm down was brutal and it really fucking hurt, that speaks to their character, not mine. For me the industry I fell back to was hospitality, for you it could be something else. It was one of the first things I did at the start of my now 14 month search which  I complimented with attempted consistent applications (not always successful but I tried). 

   The people that think this approach is beneath them are the ones that fall the hardest should their turn ever come and they're down and out, no this was not ideal but if you have the ability to walk and carry things or even another skill in a seperate industry - use these skills. Many people just can't face up to it but I needed money and my family came first, so I put my ego aside. I realise securing this other job is not a given and I'm grateful that I couls, I take nothing for granted anymore. You have to fight for everything. 

   Through this job I developed a few really nice friendships and as someone in their thirties, the older you get the harder it is to make friends (reality). This was a nice silver lining for me, now I've got a few buddies I can have a beer with that I didn't have before, who know me well now, that in itself is a big deal for me. 

***** Small Goals / Recruiters / Research *****

4 - small goals of applications / cv tweaks or LI bio refreshes each week, every other week is good - whatever it is - small steps but consistent ones as is most practical, a few at a time do help. Don't try and do everything all at once, you'll see failure, you'll go into a hole and that isn't what will help.

5 - recruiters are in my experience helpful sometimes but don't rely on someone else to drive finding you a role. Recruiters can help, but frequently unhelpful and have a universal habit of ghosting, there is very little decency anymore, there should be some if there is an engagement between you and them but that's not the world we live in. When you do get ghosted, tell them to fuck off on your head, then move on. 

   I've spent far too much time being angry at other people for doing this, when if I think about it, I was nothing more than a possible fill to a position, one in a long line of candidates on their screen, just a number. Recruiters serve an input output function. If I view them as transactional which they are, I don't get as angry when they treat me this way, it's just the nature of the beast and the industry

6 - do your own research, your own cross check of roles, is it on LI = yes, is it on the employers site = No - probably a fake add or them trying to harvest data or salary check the market for how low they can actually put the salary, there's been lots of discussion of this in the states and it's hard to deal with so be stringent, vet and if it looks suss, move on. 

***** LinkedIn / Applying / Cover Letters *****

7 - if you find a role on LI, my opinion is don't apply on LinkedIn. Find the real job and apply on the company website, you'll get lost in the noise and your application won't be reviewed if you do it though LI. Given how many people throw applications at job ads, I would be surprised if it was looked at by a human but a recruiter can comment further. 

   Tweak your cv before you submit, if it doesn't align to the role, try and make it align without straight up lying. If you lie on your cv, you will get caught out eventually, it's what the multi round interview process is partly about, not just what's on the paper but who is the person, do they know what they claim to, do they fit the role etc

8 - apply widely (within reason). Not one job here, one job there. It won't work. It is a numbers game and you really do need to pump those numbers. It's the only way.

9 - cover letters are contentious - I would say if you have a role that you're made for, you'll know if it's the one - write a cover letter, one page and tell them why you. That plus a cv (resume), I would hope helps elevate you in the pile of cvs. 

   This has been hit and miss, again one for recruiters. I will ask my HR rep if mine made a difference, I think it did but will confirm and update thread. 

***** Key Words / Simplicity / LinkedIn Hell  / Measures *****

10 - key words - no one is looking at your cv just off you hitting submit unless the hiring manager gets it directly and maybe you have a connection to them / you've LI-mailed them / already have a thread with them. Your cv goes through internal scanning (keyword matching etc), which I'm told frequently doesn't work as it's intended, resulting in people getting binned or overlooked that are a good match. 

   Look at the job ad, then if you have cross over skills but they aren't mentioned on your cv pull some of those words into your cv. You don't need to be fancy about it. Just have a section of ""Key Skills"" then start writing those seperate by a comma or forward slash - that's it. Make it easier for the scanners. 

11 - simplicity -  if a person were to read your cv and can't then at a bare minimum tell you what you do or have accomplished / achieved - how is a hiring manager supposed to know and apply it to their open role? I've spoken to many people about this and they all say the same thing. 

KISS will never get old: Keep It Simple Stupid

   Dont overestimate a hiring manager or recruiters ability to read your cv and know what you do - make it easy to understand. 

12 - be kind to yourself, you're going through in many respects - a traumatic experience. Treat yourself with care and actually take care of yourself, eat right, get proper sleep, temper the use of bad social media (reddit isn't included BUT reddit can be bad as with too much of anything can be). 

13 - turn off all LinkedIn notifications and unfollow people, this is a huge one - I personally could not handle all the self congratulatory, narcissistic, self ejaculation, masturbation horseshit aka the necessary hellscape that is LinkedIn over the last year. 

   It was eating my soul because I had to use it for role searching, so I tapped out of all of it 6 months or so ago. I had a rule of not looking at the LinkedIn feed AND ONLY using the job search / role search function / its power search to find hiring managers to connect and ping about applications I submitted. 

   I unfollowed pretty much my entire community - this was a self protection thing, I couldn't handle seeing other people's shit whether it was another person who landed or whatever, the platform sucked my motivation and self worth so I put a stop to it. I highly highly recommend if you're feeling like shit you do the same. I won't go back, there is no point just like all social media, it sucks enough of my time and for what gain, really? 

   Use it sparingly, if you can, then just get on with the job you eventually land and get the fuck off it there are some roles where that isn't possible as your role is to live on LinkedIn. That isn't the case for me and I am glad, I just don't have the capacity for it and I know many feel the same way. 

14 - measurable successes - for each role you have listed you should have measurable outputs that you can list in bullet form. This is a necessity for every role, look up examples on reddit or Google, you'll find plenty, if you don't have it - what impact have you had in that role? The hiring manager won't be able to tell, spell it out for them. 

**

These are some of my lessons learned and I hope they help you on your journey. This is the first real post I've done to reddit, if this should also go into another sub please let me know where to cross post if that's the right term? 

And most importantly, I would appreciate your feedback and input from your own experience, do you have crossover do these points resonate? Do you disagree, why? Are there things I've missed, no doubt!  

Tldr: vitamin D, family, friends, a side job outside your formal role search, baby steps that are consistent, cv tweaks, don't be too hard on yourself, this is a terrible environment but one step at a time Internet friends, one step at a time. ",5,1736666951.0,GetEmployed,0,1.0,False

Imagine a space where your words turn into melodies, your stories find their rhythm, and your creativity gets the spotlight it deserves. I‚Äôm super excited to share an idea that‚Äôs been brewing‚Äîa Songwriters' Workshop paired with genre-specific music venues around the city. It‚Äôs not just about making music; it‚Äôs about building a community where ideas come alive, with help from some amazing singers and songwriters from across India‚Äîfolks who‚Äôve worked with Netflix and done some pretty cool gigs.

Think about this: writing your own lyrics and seeing them turned into raw, emotional rock or country tracks at places like Curious Life Coffee, or soaking in the smooth, soulful vibes of jazz and its subgenres at Bar Palladio. We‚Äôre planning three shows each evening, from 6 PM to 10 PM, starting with a *pre-show* where songwriters talk about the stories and meanings behind their songs. It‚Äôs a chance to really connect with the genres and the creative process in a way that feels personal and real.

The big dream? To take this all across the country and create spaces like Nashville‚Äôs Bluebird Caf√©‚Äîintimate, inspiring, and all about the music. We want to give musicians a place to experiment, step away from the commercial grind, and dive into their creativity. And honestly, even if this doesn‚Äôt click with the masses, that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs about creating something meaningful for individuals who truly love and appreciate authentic music.

What do you think? Does this sound like something you‚Äôd want to be a part of? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts and ideas to make this even better. Let‚Äôs build something special together.",1,1736666711.0,jaipur,0,1.0,False

1hzhdqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftIdeasForWeddings/comments/1hzhdqe/wedding_tokens_simple_ideas_your_guests_will_love/,Wedding Tokens: Simple Ideas Your Guests Will Love,"Wedding tokens are a sweet way to thank your guests for being part of your special day. While traditional favors used to focus on keepsakes, today‚Äôs couples are choosing practical, consumable, or meaningful gifts that guests can actually enjoy. Let‚Äôs dive into some simple yet thoughtful ideas for wedding tokens that won‚Äôt end up forgotten or in the trash.

# What Makes a Great Wedding Token?

When choosing your wedding tokens, think about what your guests will actually use or appreciate. The best favors are:

* **Consumable**: Food and drinks are always a win.
* **Practical**: Items guests can use, like [candles](https://dreamycustom.com/products/personalized-candle) or [coasters](https://dreamycustom.com/products/marble-wood-engraved-coaster-set).
* **Eco-Friendly**: Options like seed [packets](https://dreamycustom.com/products/personalized-burlap-tote-bags-bridal-party-gifts) or reusable bags are trending.
* **Subtly Personal**: Avoid plastering your name and wedding date all over‚Äîkeep it elegant and minimal.

# Wedding Token Ideas to Try

Here are some simple, guest-approved ideas:

# Edible Wedding Tokens

* Mini jars of honey, jam, or maple syrup.
* Customized M&Ms or chocolates.
* Bags of coffee or tea blends.

# Eco-Friendly Favors

* Seed packets for wildflowers or herbs.
* [Reusable tote bags](https://dreamycustom.com/products/personalized-burlap-tote-bags-bridal-party-gifts) or [bamboo straws](https://dreamycustom.com/products/custom-eco-friendly-metal-straw-set).

# Experience-Driven Gifts

* A photo booth with instant prints guests can take home.
* S‚Äômores kits for weddings with a bonfire.

# Themed or Seasonal Ideas

* [Cozy blankets](https://dreamycustom.com/products/personalized-beach-towel) for fall weddings.
* Holiday ornaments for winter celebrations.

# Unique and Fun Options

* Lottery tickets for a little thrill.
* Custom spice blends with cooking tips.

# Do Wedding Tokens Matter?

Not every couple feels the need to include wedding tokens‚Äîand that‚Äôs okay. If your budget doesn‚Äôt allow it, or if you‚Äôd rather focus on other details, skip the favors guilt-free. Guests are there for you, not for the goodies!

# Final Thought

Whether you go with edible treats, practical gifts, or something quirky, wedding tokens should reflect your personality and make your guests smile. The goal is to give something they‚Äôll love‚Äînot something they‚Äôll leave behind. What‚Äôs your favorite wedding token idea?

I drink hard liquor every night and I can't really remember of it started 2 or 3 years ago. I used to vomit after 3 sips of beer. I was a drug addict but i overcame that and i am drugs free 8 years now. But. 2 or 3 years ago, my grandmother tried to commit suicide. For some reason i went to the local store and decided to buy a liter of heavy liquor instead of buying heroin again. I thought it would last me for a week... The next day I went to buy another bottle of the same poison. I'm functioning very well at work but I'm failing at everything else. None of my friends talk to me anymore. I ruied every relationship that i have over the years. I tried AA but i got into a bad relationship with another alcoholic who almost broke my teeth while trying to get me to break my sobriety.... I relapsed. I cannot get sober since. I'm able to stay sober for a few days during the week.... I have been awarded employee of the month about 4 times the past year and i was wasted during those months... Honestly i really don't know what to do or if i even want help. My kidneys hurt. I can't sleep even if i take my meds and my sleeping medication without alcohol. It's 08 am and i need to wake up in 24 hours to start my shift. I'm the best in my dedicated team. But, i can feel my body deteriorating. I can feel my mental health getting worse and worse. I think i even hallucinated last night while i was trying to fall asleep. My mom is making her morning coffee as i type this and I'm listening to r/letsnotmeet stories on yt while drinking my 10th can of beer. I just want it all to end.... I wish i wasn't this much of a failure. My mother looks at me with digust when she sees me drinking. I cry when i drink. I cry when I don't drink... To be fully honest I'm not sure why I'm typing all of this out.... I don't know... I want help but I want to keep drinking.... It's the only thing keeping me from putting the gun in my mouth and blowing my brains out. My shrink says i feel guilt. I've never felt it before. It's a weird feeling. I started to cry a lot during the past 2-3 years... The alcohol helps me cry... I got promoted recently but the only thing from keeping myself from ending it all is my cat. I'm scared that I'll die before her. I don't know which terrifies me more. Her dying or me dying before her. If there's anyone who would talk to me i would really appreciate it...

My psychiatrist immediately took me off methylphenidate when I told her this. After 2.5 months off meds, I'm on modafinil.

Am sharing here to keep as a log, and see what other's experiences with modafinil are.

Modafinil is a stimulant, but much milder than the ones typically used for ADHD treatment. This drug is mostly used for narcolepsy or other such disorders. It basically helps you stay alert, awake, and also is shown to improve cognition, memory, and decrease impulsivity to a degree.

Today is just my first day on modafinil, and I already feel improved attention and cognition, but I also feel kind of drowsy? Not sleepy drowsy, but like there's a film over my eyes and they feel heavy--- this is the same feeling I get when I drink coffee--- kinda sedated.

I'm going to continue on this medication for 2 weeks and then see my doctor again. Right now we're just seeing whether I can tolerate the stimulant without the anxiety and other issues I had before. If all goes well, my dose will be slowly increased until we find something that gives the benefits I got from methylphenidate, but with much less likelihood of the mood issues.

If anyone out here has tried/currently uses modafinil, what was your experience with the drug? Especially if you've had issues with stronger stimulants, I would love to hear your thoughts.",2,1736665954.0,AutisticWithADHD,0,1.0,False

1hzh06i,https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1hzh06i/portless_iphones_will_be_the_future_for_most_but/,"Portless iPhones will be the future for most, but USB-C iPhones still make sense","Apple has long been expected to transition to fully portless iPhones at some point, and for most users that makes perfect sense. But we‚Äôre seeing growing reports that the iPhone maker is first going to switch from Lightning to USB-C, and that raises a key question.
Is USB-C just a brief interim stage before iPhones go fully wireless, or do USB-C iPhones have a longer future ‚Ä¶ ?

Recent reports
Two recent reports suggest that Apple plans to switch to a USB-C iPhone port next year. Ming-Chi Kuo made the initial report, before Bloomberg corroborated.
Note that neither report means this is definitely happening. Kuo based his on supply-chain reports, and we noted at the time the uncertainties regarding these.
Apple likes to have multiple suppliers wherever possible, to allow it to negotiate better prices, and to reduce risk. If, for example, a major supplier of Lightning ports were to report Apple was planning to cut orders next year, that could mean nothing more than a rejigging of competing suppliers.
Similarly, USB-C suppliers talking about expecting a major boost in orders next year might again simply be Apple or other companies increasing orders with some suppliers while reducing them with others.
Bloomberg‚Äôs report was instead based on internal testing of a USB-C iPhone. I‚Äôm sure that report is accurate, but again, it doesn‚Äôt amount to proof. There is precisely a 100% chance that there have been USB-C iPhone prototypes within Apple‚Äôs labs for years now. Does ‚Äòtesting‚Äô mean simply experimenting with these, or something on a more formal and larger scale?
However, both sources seem reasonably confident in their predictions, so let‚Äôs assume for now that they are correct. What does this mean for the future of iPhone ports? Here are my brief thoughts.
It would be an overdue move
I‚Äôm a big fan of port standardization in general, and of USB-C in particular. My ideal is a day when absolutely all wired connections are USB-C to USB-C, and I can finally ditch five of the six trays of cables I have, not to mention the additional one with assorted adapters.
I was a bit skeptical of Kuo‚Äôs report for this reason. While I‚Äôd welcome it, my immediate question was ‚Äòwhy now?‚Äô. Apple started the switched to USB-C in the Mac back in 2016, and the iPad in 2018, so why wait another four years before the iPhone belatedly follows suit?
In particular, if Apple is heading toward portless iPhones, why go through the disruption now of a wired port change that would last for perhaps two or three years before a fully wireless iPhone?
If the reports are accurate, this is a very overdue move.
Most will be happy with portless iPhones
One possible explanation for the latter point is simply that the portless reports aren‚Äôt true, and Apple plans to stick with a wired charging and data-transfer connection option for the foreseeable future. However, I don‚Äôt buy that, for several reasons.
First, a portless iPhone is absolutely in line with Apple‚Äôs design direction. Sure, things have changed a little since Jony Ive left, but I do believe that his ‚Äúsingle slab of glass‚Äù vision is Apple‚Äôs ultimate goal.

Second, eliminating a port reduces manufacturing cost and complexity. This, too, is absolutely in line with the company‚Äôs ethos ‚Äì as the removal of the headphone jack demonstrated.
Third, removing the port improves reliability. It takes away the biggest entry point for dust and water, which will likely significantly boost the waterproofing standard. Additionally, it ends the fraying Lightning cable issue!
Finally, most iPhone owners don‚Äôt need a port ‚Äì and even fewer will do so in the future. Few iPhone owners ever do any wired data-transfer, and most people can get their charging needs met through overnight wireless charging. For top-up charges, we‚Äôre seeing a growing number of wireless charging pads in cars, coffee shops, hotels, airports, offices ‚Ä¶ you name it. This trend will only continue. Same for power banks with MagSafe charging capabilities.
But there are still people who need a wired port
Apple cannot have things both ways: argue that the iPhone is a suitable camera for professional video use (albeit mostly as a B-cam or C-cam) while at the same time removing the only practical way to transfer significant amounts of 4K (and later 8K) video footage.
If you‚Äôre using an iPhone for pro video shoots, a wired port is a necessity, and USB-C is much better than Lightning.
Similarly, there will be a minority of people for whom wireless charging isn‚Äôt practical. If you are a really heavy iPhone user, and need to go significant periods between charges, then the faster speed of wireless charging may be a necessity rather than a luxury.
So there will always be some who need a wired connection (at least until wireless charging and wireless data transfer offer speed much closer to wired connections), even if they are a minority.
What‚Äôs my best guess?
I can see one of two things happening, at the point where Apple feels ready to make the change to portless iPhones.
First, the standard iPhone model(s) go portless, while the Pro models retain a wired port. This would make for a worthwhile point of differentiation for more serious iPhone users, while the vast majority of consumers will remain happy with wireless charging and AirDrop.
Or second, have the iPhone Pro Max be the only model to continue to offer a USB-C port. This would again be consistent with certain features being exclusive to the largest and most expensive model ‚Äì like sensor shift and 2.5x optional zoom being exclusive to the iPhone 12 Pro Max.

I think Apple could probably take the second approach without upsetting too many people. Videographers are likely to appreciate the larger screen of the Pro Max, while anyone needing to push battery usage to the limits will obviously be buying the Pro Max for its longer battery life. So the two groups who most benefit from a wired port are already likely to choose the top-end model.
So that‚Äôs my bet. Sometime within the next few years, all but the iPhone Pro Max go portless, while the Pro Max gets or keeps a USB-C port. What‚Äôs your view? Please take our poll and share your thoughts in the comments.
Portless iPhones versus USB-C: What's Apple's next move?

Stick to Lightning for years yet

Switch to USB-C for all models

USB-C for Pro/Pro max models, Lightning for rest

USB-C for Pro/Pro max models, portless for rest

maybe she could opt for a latte instead if she wants something with more milk and she just continues to cut me off again and again saying how angry she is and how she only got a few sips in before it was half empty and the only thing going through my mind was ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe people get this way over coffee‚Äù

I offer her a remake and she declines insisting on a refund. So, I tell her we would be glad to give her a refund she just has to go to the front register to get it and she starts going off again how she will not and we will give it to her from the handoff plane.

1hzgz3k,https://i.redd.it/vmqa5cyefice1.jpeg,Nescaf√© Sachets halved in 3 years ,"Three years ago, sachets of Nescaf√© Classic and Nescaf√© Sunrise were a staple at kirana stores. Back then, Nescaf√© Classic was 100% coffee, while Nescaf√© Sunrise was a blend of chicory, Robusta, and Arabica. Since Sunrise wasn't ""pure"" coffee due to the added chicory, it was offered in higher quantities compared to Classic. A ‚Çπ10 sachet got you 8.5 grams of Classic or 10 grams of Sunrise. This was significantly cheaper compared to the 100g glass jars, which cost ‚Çπ300 at the time.

These sachets were supposedly""testers"" for promoting Nescaf√© products. They were convenient, affordable, and a way for people to try the coffee before committing to a jar. While the granules in jars might have been more ""intact,"" sachets were more economical and easier to transport. The sachets often contained finer powder, possibly from leftover scrap after filling jars or granules breaking during shipping, but this didn‚Äôt affect the taste.

Fast forward to today, a ‚Çπ10 sachet now contains just 3.5 grams of coffee‚Äîless than half of what it used to be. This blatant shrinkflation feels almost criminal. To add to the frustration, the price of glass jars has skyrocketed from ‚Çπ300 to ‚Çπ410 in just three years.

I regularly brew my coffee from bean to cup using a V60 and a Timemore C2 grinder, so I‚Äôd like to think I have a fairly refined palate. But on rushed mornings before college, I rely on Nescaf√© sachets for convenience. The thing is, jars and sachets taste almost identical‚Äîso why reduce the sachet quantity to such an absurd degree?

I live in Yercaud, a serene hill station, where my family and I have been residing for the past two years. Our garden has a few coffee plants that have been around for about 6‚Äì8 years, but we are the first ones to harvest them. Last year, we managed to harvest around 5kg of coffee beans. We processed the beans on our own (washing, processing, drying but roasted them in a shop) which I now use daily to brew Espresso, Americano, and Lattes using a French press and Moka pot.

We‚Äôve kept everything natural‚Äîusing only kitchen waste and natural products, without any artificial fertilizers. Although I‚Äôm new to coffee cultivation, I love coffee and believe our beans could have the potential to become a unique brand someday.

I‚Äôm reaching out to this community for advice on:

1. Understanding the composition and quality of my coffee beans.
2. Steps I can take to learn more about coffee cultivation and processing.
3. Insights into the technical aspects or best practices for improving my small-scale coffee setup.
4. Any tools, resources, or testing methods to analyze and refine my coffee.

I‚Äôd love to learn from experienced coffee enthusiasts, professionals, or anyone passionate about coffee. Thanks in advance for your help and ideas!

Though since i haven‚Äôt been able to pull a shot without channeling. 
As well with the exact same bean i grind with a setting of 5 on my breville basket to get a 2/1 ratio around 30s while i have to grind at 2 or even finest to get same results with IMS precision one. 
I usually put about 17gr coffee. 
Another note is that the puck from IMS precision is wet while the puck from stock breville is nice and dry. 

I feel like returning the IMS, i want to blame the grinder and such but i must be doing something wrong. 

Machine is sage, i have already lowered the pressure as low as i could internally without changing the OPV valve. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs probably pulling the shot around 11-12bars. When i got the machine it was way above the ‚Äúespresso range‚Äù

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the coffees are still tasty but i enjoy the process being smooth and beautiful. I like taking time to distribute the coffee evenly with my needle thingy and after tamping enjoy watching it pour beautifully with my bottomless portafilter. 

Anyway, is it normal that the IMS precision basket is requiring me to go much finer in grind setting?

I‚Äôve had a uti once about a year ago and it turned into a kidney infection, it was very bad pain but in my lower back. I could still lay down even though it hurt. I ended up going to the hospital (in Europe, I live in US now) and they gave me antibiotics and an IV pain relief. I felt much better after being on the IV, and barely felt the pain anymore. I didn‚Äôt have insurance and it ended up being ‚Ç¨560 without insurance.

2 weeks ago I started feeling burning when I peed. My mother told me it was just dehydration and to ignore it so I did. I flew 3 days later to go see my boyfriend, no pain just a bit of burning. We had a great time and had sex a couple times, but my vagina started to itch like crazy so I bought yeast infection medication. I took it for about 3 days, then forgot and ended up having sex with him twice. Today, I was flying out. I woke up at 6am with some slight pain in my abdomen, but I just thought it was the Taco Bell from last night. I woke up at 12 with the most intense pain I‚Äôve ever had in my lower abdomen and near my asshole. He took me to urgent care and the doctor said that I had a bacterial infection in my vagina, gave me some antibiotics and told me to take ibuprofen. Keep in mind that I could barely walk due to the pain in my abdomen, and no matter how I positioned myself there was constant pain.

I took the antibiotics and some ibuprofen, went to the airport and couldn‚Äôt even lift my suitcase onto the platform because it hurt so much. I was still able to walk even though my pain was bad. I got onto my flight, pain but it wasn‚Äôt deteriorating. I drank a cup of coffee and all of a sudden the pain got so much worse. I waited for everyone to get off the plane when we landed, since when I tried to stand up it hurt so much in my lower abdomen. I grabbed my stuff and waddled off the plane.

I had a connecting flight which was 9 minute walk away from when I exited. I had to stop 5 times walking there because the pain was too much. I had a breakdown in the bathroom because I tried to pee and it was so painful I had to bite down onto my wallet which barely helped. 

I got onto my next flight and all of a sudden I started to get this sharp pain in my right shoulder, as well as my side. It was so painful I couldn‚Äôt reach to grab my water bottle out of the net thing. It was constant sharp pulsating pain, so severe I wanted to cry. I got up to use the bathroom, couldn‚Äôt even pee because it was so painful and I started crying. Then started feeling hot and nauseous and felt like I was going to throw up.

Now I‚Äôm at home with this terrible pain and I can‚Äôt even lay down or be in any other position than sitting up (which still hurts). The pain is too much and I literally cry and scream when I have to move. My mom thinks I‚Äôm being overdramatic, but I think I need to go to the hospital. Please someone tell me if this is normal for a uti or not.

So my spouse and I are moving to the area in April and I want a good read on different neighborhoods in both cities and¬† suburbs. This is all very subjective of course but getting pointed in the right direction will be very helpful for our end goal of buying a home.

¬†

A little background, I've lived in Seattle, Louisville, Los Angeles and my spouse has lived in Seattle, NYC, abroad. If you happen to also know those spots feel free to use your own comparisons! I've just done what makes sense to me as an organizing principal or descriptive jumping off point. As far as our new neighborhood are looking for some activities/liveliness, a solid cocktail bar or dive, a few good restaurants, walkable (ie has sidewalks the whole way), and hopefully transit connectivity. Adding some measurement to these categories helped so I've included that rubric as well.

¬†

Walkable - has sidewalks within a 10-15min walk to main street

Transit - has a lightrail or rapidride bus plus local bus lines. Better scores for more lines and any bike infrastructure.¬†

Culture - Bars, Restaurants, coffee, venues, movie theaters, anything else cool.

Livability - Parks, Grocery, Library Branches, ability to have a SFH

¬†

Below is how I would describe a bunch of Seattle neighborhoods and would love to see how everyone relates them to areas in Minneapolis & St. Paul. That said I get the sense that St. Paul is like Tacoma or Staten Island - technically close enough to live in but more its own city/place than the related (SEA / NYC) big city its close too. That said I get the sense that St. Paul is also a lot closer than those two and so I don't want to rule it out if it fits.

¬†

But onto the slightly snarky but personally honest description of lots of Seattle neighborhoods -

¬†

Capitol Hill: Is/was the gay-borhood, lots of bars and partying, plenty to do, main hot spot for the whole city. Has a little bit of everything including grocery, specialty stops, coffee, etc. Central in the city and very connected by transit. 4 walk, 4 transit, 4 culture, 4 livability.

* Don't want to live on the main drag here or within two blocks of it. But we do like going out some times. Probably can't afford it but worth knowing where it is.

¬†

Central District: Was the black neighborhood and has been gentrified over the last 15 years. Has its charms and some little hangs here and there. More residential than not and close to some of the more popular neighborhoods. Quiet, nice, and still has some of it's prior community left. 3 on walk, 2.5 on transit, 2.5 on culture, 2.5 on livability

* Would be happy to live in a spot like this. Not the top choice but still a high one.

¬†

Beacon Hill: kinda sleepy, mostly residential, great park(s), a little bit of restaurant/bar night life but zero clubs. Still connected by transit but a little out of the way. 2 on walk, 3 on transit, 2 on culture, 3 on livability.

* Would live here but not top choice

¬†

Fremont: Used to be where the old hippies lived but now it's 1/3 business, 1/3 frat, 1/3 insta-worthy what have you. Still a classic neighborhood of the city and kind of 'the most' MLPS/TC of the neighborhoods. 2.5 on walk, 2 on transit, 4 on culture, 2.5 on livability

* Definitely a strong contender, but is the juice worth the squeeze?

¬†

Ballard: Where hipsters and die-hard townies go to have kids. It does have it all though so you can see why. Might be a little out of the way but kinda worth it. The actual most TC neighborhood in the city, even if you don‚Äôt want to admit it.¬† 3.5 on walk, 2 on transit, 4 on culture, 3.5 on livability

* Like being closer to the city but for a killer neighborhood we'd quickly compromise on that

¬†

Columbia City: It's cute, it basically has everything you need, but it's not hip and it's a little out of the way. Everyone that lives there swears it is where you should be, but you just don't believe them. If you can't live in a cool neighborhood you'll settle for this. 2 on walk, 2 on transit, 3 on culture, 2 on livability

* It‚Äôs a maybe but not a top choice

¬†

Greenlake: Unique to Seattle (hopefully not to the twin cities) to have a community around a lake. Everyone here flocks to walk/bike/swim/etc. Can't be beat in the spring and summer, still pretty great year round. Cute environs. Has the main needs and some good amenities.¬† Basically a great little microcosm of the city. 3 on walk, 2 on transit, 3 on culture, 3 on livability.

* I'm sure living near a lake/water is still expensive but would love to see if we can swing it. Just want to have other stuff nearby.

¬†

Wallingford: Always a little more upscale than it's neighbors but still approachable. All the stuff is concentrated to the main drag, but that keeps the surrounding area a little more homey. A good balance of stuff to do and neighborly environment. Good location in the city, not central but close to downtown. 3 on walk, 2 on transit, 3 on culture, 2.5 on livability.

* Maybe a little on the quiet side, but pretty much right up our ally.

¬†

University District: Its indeed where the university and kids are. It‚Äôs a little low rent, a little too loud, but it's walkable, close to most of the city, and cheap. It's never as great as you remember but it's got it's charm. 3.5 walk, 3 on transit, 2 on livability.

* Quality of life might not be compatible with my age and needs.

¬†

Queen Anne: Old money and old charm, classy all around. Maybe not the heart of the city but a chamber of it or perhaps a main artery. If you can afford to live here it's pretty great. 3 on walk, 3 on transit, 3 on culture, 3 on livability

* I don't think we can afford to live in whatever this neighborhood is, but it's good to have a point of reference.

¬†

West Seattle: a mini city within itself both in location and vibes. A little more laid back and a solid mix residential and urban fabric. Not the coolest but not completely washed, just a pain in the ass to get in & out of during rush hours. 2.5 on walk, 2.5 on transit 3.5 on culture, 4 on livability

* Lived in this area and would again, we don‚Äôt mind a little bubble so long as it has the stuff we want.

¬†

Greenwood/Phinney Ridge: Weirdly linear, almost everything is along one main drag. But it's got lots of great stuff along that line. It's definitely a little chichi and mostly upper-middle class but still has some working class spots as well. Not quite the furthest area that still the city, but close. 2 walk, 2 on transit, 3 on culture, 3.5 on livability.

* Not quite our speed but not the last choice.

¬†

Northgate: Basically the furthest reaches of the actual city. Kind of a horrible mismatch of isolated apartment complexes, big mall parking lots, strip malls, and stroads. It's not a bad or rough area, just kinda the worst parts of unplanned city expansion. 1 on walk, 4 on transit, 2 on culture, 1 on livability

¬†

Ravenna/Roosevelt/Maple Leaf/Wedgewood: Lumping these all in together as they all seem to serve the same function; a nice mostly residential area with little in amenities adjoining a slightly more connected or active neighborhood. All are nice, mixed SLF and apartments, some general small businesses. No great shakes but still nice and in the city. Kinda the burbs. 2 on walk, 2.5 on transit, 1.5 on culture, 3 on livability.

* I'd like to think we are a little more active than these locations but we'd still probably live in areas like this.

¬†

¬†

TL:DR - I described places in Seattle, please match them to places in the twin cities so I'll know where to live when I move.

And I mean probably over my 3+ decades. Unfortunately for me I only learned about SD late in life - but still learned nonetheless which is better than nothing. What I think worked for me, and there are many things:

\-getting rid of old dirty carpeting

\-replacing old mattress, pillows, and bedding

\-washing clothes more frequently, with vinegar to kill nasties

\-eating Kimchi every day. It could be something else, but this one I think works. It's got the beneficial bacteria. There's something wrong with my gut, I'm very likely ASD, and I think SebDerm is completely tied to the gut. Fix this as best you can.

\-Apple Cider Vinegar. Don't overdo this one. Took me awhile to realize ACV can also make my fair skin red. So a mild bath once a week, and pour some in a cup with water and drink once a week. 

\-MCT - rub a tiny bit in the hair and rinse out quick after. Usually requires shampoo to get out. Or just add to food and coffee and ingest.

\-When you see redness or scaly patches, dab and smear the tiniest amount of Clotrimazole cream on it. This likely has different names in various countries, but it's an over-the-counter antifungal. Reduces the redness pretty quick. 

\-If in a cold climate reduce as much skin exposure to sub-freezing air and wind. This one is hard to do, but it definitely helps. The cold wind always brings out the scaling for me. 

\-Get a good sweat at least once a week. It clears out your pores full of fungus. I use a sauna when I can.

\-Wash face with Cerave face cleanser, and lotion with Cerave lotion. Other products work, but this one I use.

\-Vitamins. I stopped taking B6 and Folic. But B12 I think is the one! I'll take 1.5 doses of B12, Zinc, D, C, and Omega. I also take regular doses of Iron, E, and half a B50 complex (which will have the B6 and Folic I mentioned). I also take Biotin which I'm sure helps re-growth. 

\-Exercise, stretch, eat well. Nothing crazy. But will likely help. 

  
Will add if I'm forgetting anything. I can probably make more changes. Cut out beer. Smoking. And bread. But for now these results are 1000x better than where I was last year. ",1,1736662869.0,SebDerm,2,1.0,False

[$500],"Hi, I want to upgrade my current setup but I‚Äôm not quite sure what would be the best, so I‚Äôd like some input of experienced coffee lovers that went through the process.

Some background first: Even though I am the coffee enthusiast, my wife also enjoys coffee and would need to be able to operate the equipment as well. We really only drink milky drink like Flat whites, cappuccinos and sometimes a cortado and this would be our daily use equipment. We currently live in South Africa so we dont have access to everything out there otherwise shipping may become too much, as I am currently on a budget.

I currently have a cheap Russel Hobbs grinder that can just grind fine enough to use in pressurised baskets and might not even be fine enough but as we drink mostly milky drink its still delicious. I am using the Delongi Dedica as my current espresso machine.

So I am currently considering buying the breville barista express (this is also basically top of my budget to give you an idea of what I am able to spend) as its quite a nice all in one machine that is very convenient to use. I am also considering only buying a grinder which would enable me to buy a better grinder and sticking with the delongi dedica for now and upgrading that at a later stage. The only thing is, I am struggling to find a good grinder in my budget that has some dosing control as I would not really want to weigh out each shot‚Äôs beans and single dose grind as my wife will be using the machine as well and although she loves coffee she doesnt necessarily enjoy the coffee making as much as I do.

Let me know what you think I should do. Whatever I do, would have to stay for the next few years before I can upgrade again. 

Some of the brand we do have access to in South Africa are Breville, Lelit, Delongi, Gaggia, Rancilio, Barratza, Eureka, Fellow.

Today, however, during the read through, I said the line as written and though I knew it was approaching, I had a small panic and didn‚Äôt substitute another exclamation.

We dated for 7yrs and married for 15yrs.

In 2006, I caught her cheating on me but she lied that they just went out for a coffee and I stupidly believed and forgave her. She cheated on me 3 more times after that(found some evidence and she confessed). None of these were full blown affair but she went out with them and kissed them a few times. She almost had sex with one of them. They were more like flings. All these happened before we got married when she was 22\~25yrs old. We moved to Canada from USA 15yrs ago and got married. She didn't cheat after we got married.

Of course I didn't believe what she said so I asked her to take the polygraph. She took it and passed. I don't trust polygraph 100% but I will never take it if I know that I am lying. I also took the paternity test and kids are mine.

I thought about it for 3 months and decided to keep our marriage because our kids are too young(4&7yrs old) and she has been a great wife&mother&dauther in law after marriage. And our marriage has also been great.

But she will have a consequence this time.

Initially I thought about one-sided postnup but I heard it is basically useless in Canada.

Should I divorce her and maybe re-marry with a one-sided prenup? She is very remorseful and willing to give up basically everything(custody,assets) if that makes me feel better. She knows how badly she screwed up and basically is waiting for the consequences. I know 100% She won't change her mind when lawyer tries to convince her not to give up those things.

All she wants is to stay with me and the kids. She lost her parents and have no siblings. We are the only family she has now.

I kind of feel bad and mad at the same time that I need to do something to her but I already gave her a chance and she screwed up.",0,1736662730.0,legaladvicecanada,19,0.35,False
