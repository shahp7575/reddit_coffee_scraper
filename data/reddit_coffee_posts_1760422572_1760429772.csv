1o69iz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Defiance/comments/1o69iz5/here_is_the_practical_explanation_about_next_life/,here is the Practical explanation about next life - by Niketananam,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Houston Rockets vs. New Orleans Pelicans: A Preseason Power Play**  
*Same-Game Parlay Breakdown for October 14, 2025*

**Odds Deep Dive**  
The Houston Rockets are the clear favorites here, with moneyline odds hovering around **1.5** (implied probability: \~66.7%) across DraftKings, FanDuel, and BetMGM. The New Orleans Pelicans, meanwhile, sit at **2.6–2.7** (implied probability: \~37–38%), reflecting their shaky preseason start (0-2) and lack of proven stars. The spread is Rockets **-5.5** (most books) to **-4.5** (BetOnline.ag), while the total is locked at **230.5** points.

**Why the Rockets Are Cooking with Gas**  
Kevin Durant’s presence has turned the Rockets’ offense into a five-alarm fire. In his lone preseason game, he dropped 20 points, and his gravitational pull alone elevates teammates like Alperen Sengun (who’s looking like a Turkish titan in the paint) and Amen Thompson (a rookie with the handles of a magician and the shot selection of a spreadsheet analyst). The Rockets are now scoring **130 points per game** in the preseason—up from a pedestrian **104 ppg** in last year’s playoffs. Their offense? A well-oiled jet engine compared to the Pelicans’ go-kart.

**Pelicans: All Rookies, No Brakes**  
New Orleans’ hope rests on 2025 draft darlings Ace Bailey and Walter Clayton Jr., who’ve combined for 42 points in two games. Sounds fun, but it’s also like betting on a pair of hot-dog-eating contest winners to run a marathon. The Pelicans’ veterans—Kevin Love (a once-mighty forward now playing like a guy who forgot his coffee) and Jusuf Nurkic (a solid center but no Durant)—lack the star power to counter

Been following this sub over the last year or so and it inspired me to upgrade my afternoon americano to a V60 switch pourover, and it's been life changing! So firstly, thanks :)

Ok straight to the context... I've been an espresso guy before this and have the D64v gen2 with stock DLC burrs that I use with my Lelit Mara X, and since I switched over to Hario Switch, I've been using the same grinder for pourover as well. Been trying a lot of specialty light roasts from Columbia, Ethiopia, Kenya including some real funky ones and have been loving it so far. Off late I've been mildly annoyed by the constant change in settings on my grinder for my morning flat white (grind setting: 10-15, RPM 1200) to my afternoon pourover (60-70, RPM 800), and also wondering if there's more flavour to be unlocked with a top hand grinder more purpose built for pourover. Research has led me to the 1Zpresso K Ultra.

**In short, is the 1Zpresso K Ultra an upgrade over the D64v gen2 with DLC stock burrs for pourover?** Will it add more clarity to my cup because of fewer fines, or am I just spending money sideways?  
(Looked into the ZP6 as well, but I'm not sure if I'd want all coffees thin and tea-like. Like me a little body). Any and all opinions welcome. Good day gentlefolk!",1,1760428714.0,pourover,0,1.0,False
1o69fgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftViva/comments/1o69fgm/from_burnout_to_balance_how_microsoft_viva_can/,From Burnout to Balance: How Microsoft Viva Can Actually Make Work Better (Really),"Three years ago, I hit a wall so hard that my ‘out of office’ reply practically begged people not to email me again. I'd always brushed off phrases like ‘burnout’—until it knocked at my door. Turns out, a growing chunk of us are right there: exhausted, disconnected, skeptical about yet another ‘workplace solution.’ So, let's ditch the corporate speak and look honestly at whether something like Microsoft Viva is just buzz—or whether it can tip the scale back towards sanity. We're going on a human-sized, quirk-filled journey from overwhelm to balance, blending big data with small moments you’ll recognize yourself in.

# Why Burnout Keeps Beating ‘Best Practices’ (and What That Has to Do with 2025)

Let’s get real about burnout in 2025. The latest **burnout statistics 2025** are more than just numbers—they’re a wake-up call. According to recent data, **66% of American employees are experiencing burnout**. That’s two out of every three people you work with, and it’s not just a passing trend. As one report puts it:

>""About 66% of American employees are experiencing burnout. This highlights how widespread and serious the issue has become.""

So why do all those “best practices” for **work-life balance strategies** keep falling short? The answer is in the details—and the data.

# Anxiety on the Rise: What’s Fueling Burnout?

Burnout isn’t just a buzzword. It’s the broken sleep, the short tempers, and the endless emails that never seem to stop. The **burnout statistics 2025** break down the causes:

* **Economic uncertainty:** 20% of employees say this is affecting their well-being. When the economy is shaky, stress levels skyrocket, and it’s tough to stay motivated.
* **Labor shortages:** 19% are taking on excessive workloads because there simply aren’t enough people to share the load. That means longer hours and more pressure.
* **Lack of proper tools:** 24% don’t have the resources or equipment they need to do their jobs well. This makes even simple tasks more frustrating and time-consuming.
* **Overwhelming workloads:** Another 24% feel buried by more work than they can handle in a reasonable amount of time. The result? Work-life balance goes out the window and exhaustion sets in.

# When “Productivity Hacks” Aren’t Enough

I’ve tried every “productivity hack” out there—color-coded calendars, time-blocking, even apps that gamify my to-do list. But here’s the truth: I just ended up scheduling my stress. No matter how many hacks I tried, the root problems—too much work, not enough support, and constant uncertainty—kept winning.

# Why Typical Well-Being Strategies Fall Short

Most **work-life balance strategies** focus on individual habits, but they don’t address the bigger issues. When **employee well-being** is undermined by structural problems like labor shortages or lack of resources, no amount of meditation or time management tips can fix it. That’s why the stakes for **workplace productivity transformation** are higher than ever. If we want real change, we have to look beyond surface-level solutions and tackle the root causes head-on.

# Hybrid Work, Digital Overload, and the Changing Rules of Collaboration

Goodbye, cubicles—hello, hybrid work environments. The shift to remote and hybrid work isn’t just a trend; it’s the new standard. As someone who’s lived through the transition, I can tell you: digital collaboration tools like Microsoft Viva aren’t just nice-to-haves anymore. **They’re essential for keeping teams connected, productive, and sane.** As one expert put it,

>“Organizations now rely heavily on digital tools to facilitate teamwork. These tools are no longer optional.”

Let’s be real: the perks of remote work are obvious. No more long commutes (I’ve traded my hour-long drive for a 30-second walk to my coffee maker), and there’s more flexibility to fit work around life. But there’s a flip side—*digital overload*. Last week, I attended 30 virtual meetings. By Friday, my cat knew more about my projects than my manager did. The line between work and home blurs when your office is your kitchen table, and the pings from Microsoft Teams or Slack don’t stop just because the clock says 6 p.m.

Hybrid work environments have changed the rules of collaboration. We now depend on digital collaboration tools not just for productivity, but for our *employee experience* and emotional well-being. The challenge? Too much screen time can lead to fatigue, stress, and a sense of isolation—even if we’re technically more “connected” than ever. Flexible work schedules won’t help if we’re glued to our screens or checking notifications at midnight.

This is where Microsoft Viva, integrated with Microsoft 365 and Teams, steps in. Viva isn’t just another app—it’s designed to anchor us amid the chaos. It helps streamline communication, organize knowledge, and even nudge us to take breaks. By surfacing insights about our work habits, Viva encourages us to set boundaries and prioritize mental health. It’s about making digital collaboration tools work for us, not the other way around.

Here’s what I’ve learned about thriving in this new landscape:

* **Embrace flexibility**, but set clear boundaries—your brain needs downtime.
* **Leverage digital collaboration tools** for connection, not just communication.
* **Prioritize well-being**—use features like focus time and wellness reminders in Microsoft Viva.
* **Recognize when creativity strikes**: My best ideas come at 6:37 a.m. in the kitchen, not during “collaboration hour.”

The evolution of the modern workplace means less commuting and more screen time. The balance between flexibility and digital fatigue is fragile, but with the right tools—especially those integrated into Microsoft 365—we can create a healthier, more connected employee experience.

# Microsoft Viva: Actually Useful or Just Another Dashboard?

Let’s be honest—when I first heard about Microsoft Viva, I wondered if it was just another dashboard cluttering up my digital workspace. But after diving into the **Microsoft Viva features** and exploring the **Viva Suite subscription**, I realized it’s not just a jumble of tools. Viva is designed as a unified platform, centralizing learning, analytics, feedback, and communications for teams—especially those navigating hybrid or remote work.

# Not Just a Jumble of Features: Viva Suite Breakdown

* **Viva Learning module:** Curates training content from LinkedIn Learning, Microsoft Learn, and your own company resources—making upskilling part of the daily workflow.
* **Viva Insights analytics:** Uses **AI in the workplace** to surface personalized recommendations, like scheduling focus time or reminding you to take breaks. It’s about supporting well-being, not just tracking productivity.
* **Viva Engage & Communications:** Fosters connection and feedback with social feeds, polls, and announcements—keeping everyone in the loop, wherever they work.

# Holistic, Not Hectic: Supporting Real People

What sets Viva apart is its holistic approach. Instead of just checking boxes, it weaves together **employee experience features** that support both leaders and employees. The feedback loops and analytics aren’t just for managers—they’re designed to help everyone thrive. For example, **Viva Insights** can highlight team stress patterns and suggest actionable steps, while **Viva Learning** nudges you to build skills at your own pace.

# Odd Fact: The ‘Virtual Commute’

One of my favorite quirky features is the *virtual commute*. At the end of your day, Viva prompts you to wind down, reflect, and set boundaries—helping you switch off from work, even when your office is your kitchen table. It’s a small touch, but it really helps prevent burnout.

# Wild Card: Would a Dance Break Lower Stress?

Imagine if Microsoft Viva’s AI nudged you to take a dance break instead of jumping into your next meeting. Would it lower stress? Maybe! While that’s not (yet) a built-in feature, Viva’s focus on well-being and workflow balance is clear throughout the platform.

# Embedded Where Work Happens

Viva isn’t another tab you’ll forget about. It’s built right into **Microsoft Teams** and **Outlook**, so it lives where your work happens—making it easy to access insights, learning, and feedback without context-switching.

>It’s truly an all-in-one platform designed to elevate the employee experience across the board.

With **Microsoft Viva pricing plans** ranging from $2–$12 per user/month (annual commitment), and modules like **Viva Learning** or **Insights** starting at $4 per user/month, it’s flexible for different team needs. Plus, **Microsoft 365 integration** means you’re not adding more chaos—just more support.

# The Human Touch: Why Analytics Alone Won’t Save Your Sanity

Let’s be honest: workplace analytics are powerful, but they’re not magic. I’ve seen firsthand how Viva Insights analytics can highlight trends, flag burnout risks, and even nudge us to take breaks. But here’s the truth—no dashboard, no matter how advanced, can replace a real conversation or a supportive culture. Data doesn’t hug people, but good leadership does—or, it should.

# Viva’s Layers of Insights: What They Offer (and What They Don’t)

Viva Insights analytics are structured across three levels, each with its own strengths:

* **Leader Insights:** These are aggregated, de-identified analytics that give business leaders a high-level view of trends across the organization. As Microsoft puts it,“Leader insights… help identify patterns and inform strategic decisions without compromising individual privacy.” This is great for spotting big-picture issues, but the numbers alone won’t tell you why your team is disengaged or who needs extra support.
* **Manager Insights:** These tools help people managers understand team dynamics, support team health, and boost productivity. They’re fantastic for surfacing patterns—like too many after-hours emails—but it’s still up to managers (and us) to act. That might mean introducing no-meeting days or holding honest feedback sessions.
* **Personal Insights:** This is private data for individual employees, designed to help us improve our own work habits and well-being. Automated prompts can remind us to set boundaries, but let’s be real: ignoring your Slack notifications at 7 p.m. takes guts (ask me how I know).

# Analytics + Action = Real Change

Here’s where many organizations get stuck. Workplace analytics and team support tools are only as effective as the people using them. Employee engagement strategies and manager effectiveness hinge on more than just numbers—they require trust, open feedback, and leadership that goes beyond dashboards.

One of the best ‘insights’ I ever received wasn’t from a report. It was when a colleague noticed my camera was always off in meetings and checked in to ask if I was okay. That moment of genuine care did more for my well-being than any automated reminder ever could.

# How to Bring the Human Touch Back

* Use analytics as conversation starters, not conversation enders.
* Pair data with regular, honest employee feedback.
* Empower managers with team support tools—but train them in empathy and active listening.
* Encourage leadership to model healthy boundaries and engagement.

Ultimately, Viva Insights analytics are a springboard. The real transformation happens when we combine data with humanity, trust, and a willingness to act.

# How to Spot (and Sustain) Real Well-Being in a Digital-First Office

Let’s be honest: in a digital-first office, it’s easy to slip into “always on” mode. But real **employee well-being** isn’t about squeezing more hours out of the day—it’s about setting boundaries, building healthy habits, and using the right **work-life balance strategies**. Microsoft Viva is packed with **employee experience features** designed to help, but the magic only happens when we use them intentionally.

# Boundary-Setting: More Than Just a Notification

Viva lets you configure your work hours, set start and end times, and sync time zones with Outlook. This means your calendar reflects your real schedule—no more late-night meeting surprises. I’ll admit, the first time Viva reminded me to log off, I laughed, then felt guilty for ignoring it. But after a while, I realized these nudges are like speed bumps: they’re not the destination, but they do stop you from crashing along the way.

# Virtual Commutes and Mindful Transitions

One of my favorite **mental health initiatives** in Viva is the “virtual commute.” It’s a digital transition period—just a few minutes to shift gears from work mode to personal life. This helps me mentally prepare for downtime and reinforces the boundary between work and home, especially when I’m remote. Viva’s wrap-up reminders also encourage me to reflect, disconnect, and recharge for the next day.

# Focus Time: Protecting Your Most Valuable Resource

>""Viva Insights encourages us to safeguard blocks of time free from interruptions so we can concentrate on meaningful tasks without constant disruptions.""

With Viva, you can block out focus time directly in your calendar. These protected windows are crucial for deep work and help reduce the stress of constant context-switching. The built-in productivity suggestions in Outlook also help me manage tasks and meetings more effectively, so I can stay focused on what matters.

# Team Culture and Personal Accountability

Here’s the truth: software can nudge, but it can’t force well-being. Sustaining balance takes more than reminders. It’s about team rituals (like respecting offline hours), manager role modeling, and forgiving yourself when you slip up. Real **employee retention improvement** and well-being come from a mix of intentional tech use, supportive culture, and personal responsibility.

* Set clear digital boundaries and honor them.
* Use virtual commutes and wrap-up reminders as daily rituals.
* Block focus time and protect it fiercely.
* Encourage your team to do the same—and lead by example.

Spotting and sustaining well-being in a digital-first office is a persistent effort at every level—tools, teams, and personal choices all play a part.

# Conclusion: Can Microsoft Viva Really Fix Work—or Just Make It a Little Less Broken?

After exploring Microsoft Viva’s features and how they fit into the bigger picture of employee experience, it’s clear that there’s no single tool or platform that can magically “fix” work. Real, lasting change in the workplace is about mindset and culture, not just software. Still, I’ve seen firsthand how Microsoft Viva can make a real difference—when used intentionally and as part of a broader employee engagement strategy.

Viva’s strengths lie in its ability to reduce friction and nudge us toward better habits. For example, the productivity suggestions in Outlook help me manage my tasks and meetings more effectively, so I can focus on what truly matters. The no meeting day plans are another favorite—they give me dedicated time to actually get work done, rather than just talking about work. These Microsoft Viva features aren’t just bells and whistles; they’re practical tools that support healthier work-life balance and a more positive workplace culture.

But let’s be honest: Viva won’t walk your dog, silence your emails after hours (at least not yet), or force your boss to respect your boundaries. Technology can only go so far. Sustained well-being and engagement are multi-layered, and neither tech-only nor culture-only initiatives are enough on their own. The real magic happens when technology, management, and humanity work together. Leaders need to model healthy boundaries, teams need to commit to using these features well, and everyone needs to know when it’s time to log off.

As I’ve learned, workplace change is a marathon, not a sprint. Microsoft Viva is a powerful supporting tool, but it’s not the destination. Employee experience features are only as strong as the commitments teams and leaders make to using them. If you want a workplace where people thrive, technology like Viva can help—but it’s just one part of the formula.

>""You don’t need to be a tech wizard or a mindfulness guru: Microsoft Viva, when used intentionally, can genuinely make work-life easier and healthier. But, as always, the magic is a mix of tools, culture shifts, and knowing when to log off.""

Let’s be real — *bios are dead*. No one wants to read yet another “I love chai and travelling” line on a dating profile. Gen Z dating apps are all about vibes, not resumes. And honestly, opening chats with “Hey, how are you?” feels like the love life equivalent of dry toast. Enter **dating without bios** — a fresh approach where the convo starts with laughter, not LinkedIn-style personality summaries.

# Meet Schmooze: Where Love Meets Laughter

The **Schmooze app** flips the script by turning dating into a meme match-making game. Instead of endless swipes based on looks or a two-line ‘about me,’ Schmooze shows you a stream of memes. You swipe on the ones that make you laugh, cringe, or scream “omg SAME.” The algorithm pairs you with people whose humor matches yours, skipping the awkward “What’s up?” stage and jumping straight into meme flirt culture.

# Why Memes Make the Best Icebreakers

This is not just another **funny dating trend** — it’s a legit connection hack. Memes instantly show your sense of humor, your pop culture taste, and even your chaos level. Where traditional dating apps rely on polished pics and bios (that may or may not be real), meme-first conversations feel authentic and effortless. Suddenly, you’re trading jokes, not ghosting after two days. And honestly? Laughing together over a perfectly timed meme feels way more intimate than bonding over coffee preferences.

# The Future is Meme-Flirting

In a world where ghosting, dry texting, and “wyd” culture run wild, meme-first dating apps like Schmooze feel like a breath of fresh, unfiltered air. They make dating fun again — less pressure, more personality. For a generation fluent in reaction images and sarcasm, meme flirting might just be the native language of love. So if you’re done with bios, boring intros, and forced banter, maybe it’s time to swipe on humor instead. Your soulmate might just share your favorite SpongeBob meme.

He 2-3 times made excuses that we cannot do it, you accept it and mark it return etc.. but I told him to cancel it and did not received the delivery

After few minutes I received the message on whatsapp from amazon that your package is delivered

I talked to customer care on chat (after 4-5 attempts to go through that AI shit) and talked to an agent who refunded for the same 

I was surprised with the confidence of the delivery person to mark it as delivered and keep it in this personal custody

1o69bf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthAustin/comments/1o69bf7/south_manchaca_rumors_music_village_stinson_trail/,"South Manchaca rumors, Music Village, Stinson Trail","Hi yall. I’ve seen some post with some misconceptions about what all is happening on South Manchaca and I though I’d take a moment to set the record straight. My name is Stinson and I’m a looong time South Austinite and a full-time Bubba. I’m the local land developer who has been focused on preserving South Manchaca Road for the past 14 years or so.

Before I start I’d like to share a bit of background on my family’s connection to South Austin. My family patriarchs settled on farmland that is now Peter Pan Golf and Bouldin area back in 1851. Another patriarch got here so early that his business was a ford crossing where the Chisholm Trail cross the Colorado River before Waterloo had any bridges. Another branch of my family settled Davis Lane in the 1840’s. My great-great Aunt, Mollie Dawson, was one of Austin’s first female teachers and later developed many areas of what is now Bouldin. More recently we all grew up on a cattle farm on Manchaca at Davis Lane. All that land is long gone, but we still remain on Manchaca Road, hence my love and connection for South Austin.

In 2019 just before Covid started my business partner came to me and asked if I had a passion project that I would like to see through realization. He said it could be anything that I really cared about even if it’s hardly profitable. I told him that I had always wanted to preserve South Manchaca from becoming overran with dull boring corporate owned 5 story apartments and national restaurant chains. As many of you know this area was never annexed into the city limits which attracted many entertainment venues. The only problem was it was not very walkable and is next to a 55 MPH highway. Unfortunately the area has experienced a lot of pedestrian fatalities over the years due to the lack of sidewalks even before The bars existed. 

Through many restless nights of studying the area maps I realized that most of the lots surrounding Moontower Saloon had a back line that almost made a perfect line. Could this back line become a pedestrian trail tucked safe away from the speeding cars? It would take us many years to find out. So in 2020 we began purchasing as much land in the area just south of Slaughter Lane as we could get in an effort to connect up the proposed trail path.

The area currently is home to Sam’s Town Point, Armadillo Den, Moontower Saloon, Bouldin Acres South, MSB, Reset Bar, Lulu’s, Bohdi’s Hideout, The Hive, Drifter’s Social, Pickle Hub, and SABG. I hear that Cosmic Coffee, Rush Racket Sports, and a lit par 3 golf attraction are soon to open in the area as well. We are rezoning some land on Slaughter Lane facing HEB, and almost all of the rest of Allred Road is rezoning to LR-MU. The energy is gathering for sure.

We met with County Comissioners and City Council members in an effort to figure this much needed pedestrian path out. The only problem was that Travis County development code really didn’t offer a way to create a contiguous and useful place for a safe pedestrian passage anytime in the near future. So we got busy with neighbors to buy or borrow their back line to make a proposed .9 mile walking trail that could connect land on Slaughter lane near Sam’s all the way down to the Slaughter Creek trail system. Most neighbors were delighted to contribute land, while others have been less interested in the idea. All in all we only have one small section that has held out, but we are hopeful that the new land owners will join our efforts soon as they seem to me much brighter than the last lady.

In November of 2024 I filed a petition to remove the area by election from the Austin ETJ, a move that would allow for simpler funding and permitting timelines for the trail development. The area still has the same environmental water quality standards that it had before, same impervious cover limits, and we have all voluntarily decided to dedicate any previously protected live oaks trees into permanent protection through deed restrictions. This was really important to me because I’m a tree hugger and nature enthusiast, some might better describe me as a cowboy hippie, but regardless TREES  ARE IMPORTANT!

The area really doesn’t have an official name, but due to the amount of venues in the area it has been proposed that we adopt Music Village as the new namesake. So that’s the name I’m promoting.

As we enter into 2026 soon I will be building and opening the first section of the trail from Slaughter creek to Lynnbrook Drive. Currently we are self funding the segments of the project but would love it if some local philanthropist or businesses might want to partner with us on this effort. The trail will also feature space for farmers market and vintage trading booths plus much more area parking. I plan to add community chess tables along the trail as well. At the south end of the trails proposed path it will terminate into the Slaughter Creek trail system, which COA has proposed to expand to connect to East Austin trail systems and westward to the Violet Crown Trail. Due to the coming sports attractions we hope to become an outdoors recreational destination.

My hope is that this area will be preserved from big development for many more generations to come and that it will become a hub for community connection for all Austinites.

I have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in effort to environmentally engineer and plan the trail, and will be donating over two acres of land to see this effort through. Selfishly I plan to name the trail sections that I am donating after my late father, Ned Stinson, a lifelong public educator who taught drivers education at Crockett High School until his death in 1991. He cared a lot about public safety and building community in South Austin.

So the next time you pass by the Stinson Trail sign on South Manchaca don’t wonder if this is some dickhead trying to Vegas your South Austin. We are just trying to raise awareness that this area needs critical infrastructure and also trying to promote locally owned businesses that can stave off big development for many more decades to come. Someone recently told me that “South Austin is all of the real Austin that we have left”, and it made me tear up a bit… but then I went to Sam’s where I danced and smiled all night long remembering that we still have this little slice of what Austin used to be about.

So I welcome your comments and criticism  here publicly and privately. I realize this isn’t every person’s  ideal outcome for the area. You won’t hurt my feelings. I welcome new ideas that could enhance this all. I welcome your assistance if you’d like to help my efforts somehow.

\- 32GB DDR5 Viper ELITE 6000MHz RAM

\- ID Cooling AIO

\- 2TB Patriot SSD

\- ADATA XPG 850w 80 Plus Gold power supply



A few months later, I added a Zotac RTX 5080.



The problem started a month ago. I got up, turned on the computer to check some work stuff, went to make some coffee, and when I came back, the PC was frozen. It's really weird, that had never happened before. I tried CTRL+ALT+DEL, but it didn't work. I tried holding down the power button, but nothing worked either. I had to unplug it. When I tried to turn it back on, the red and yellow/orange lights on the motherboard came on, indicating the CPU and DRAM. I tried absolutely everything I could find, but nothing worked. Something had died.

After arguing with the reseller (Maximus Gaming Argentina) because I had thrown away the motherboard box, they agreed to review it. They tested it and it worked correctly. At the same time, they started the RMA process with AMD. No problems. They didn't even ask for the product box (as they did with the ASRock motherboard). DHL came to pick it up, and approximately one week later, they sent me a new, sealed 9800x3d. (I'll clarify a minor detail since I've seen little information published about AMD RMAs in Argentina. Basically, you contact them, they ask for some information, you receive an email to confirm it, but it says you have to send it to Miami, which costs approximately $200. Don't despair because a few days later, SIRCOMPANY will contact you to coordinate DHL pickup at your doorstep at no cost to you.) Back to the topic, I connected the new processor, the same lights came on but a few seconds later they turned off and the PC turned on, not even 6 hours passed since that and playing Monster Hunter Wilds the PC froze again, this time since I was using it I detected it instantly and I was able to turn it off by holding down the power button, after that it turned on, threw the CPU and DRAM error lights but in a few seconds it returned to normal, I will continue testing to see if it was a strong crash of that particular game or if it is processor instability.

I sat on the back porch and watched the sunset filtering through the trees. The wind moved through my hair as I sipped my coffee. And I thought of you.

I let myself remember you. Fully. Quietly. I’ve buried you in my soul like California gold.

Then I whispered your name into the wind, and told it I love you.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

One of them is this one -----> A **social ad mockup generator**. this prolly done by others before. But super proud I was able to do it on my own. :)  
  
Upload your product image (bag, food, jewelry, coffee drink, etc) → choose a vibe → get a ready-to-post ad with captions.

All inside **Google AI Studio**, for free (token-based nga lang... meaning there is a threshold di say free forever).

# Here’s what it does. Yung step by step. May video naman to watch how I do it like super duper easy.

✅ **Step 1 – Generate social media mockups**  
Upload a product photo → pick a preset scene (lifestyle, flat lay, seasonal, minimal, etc.) → choose a channel (Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, Facebook, X) → boom, it creates a realistic ad mockup.

✅ **Step 2 – Add custom background + product placement**  
Upload a product + background image and tell the AI where to place it (e.g. “bottom right, angled with shadow”). It blends perfectly into the scene.

✅ **Step 3 – Auto-generate ad copy**  
Type in your product + tone (playful, luxury, urgent, etc.) and it writes 2–3 captions tailored to the platform — hashtags for IG, casual for TikTok, professional for LinkedIn.

# Why I’m sharing this?

It’s working really well for me I’ve been using it to generate several **product mockups per day** for my friends who have product based businesses for their ads and content testing.

Alam yung best part? It’s completely **free to build** if you follow the same steps inside Gemini AI Studio. You just need an **API key** (if you wish to deploy it and share it to others.

# How to try it

1. Watch the short video demo I attached.  It shows how fast you can make social media ads kahit you dont use canva. Saves hours designing.
2. If you want to **build it yourself**,  sali ka sa TG community (link inside my [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fyIk9YuCIoPsltCzLNC7iIKPs2JJUGTy7icS9P_YTgU/edit?usp=sharing) since Reddit doesn’t allow direct TG links).
3. Or if you’d rather have me **set it up for you**, send me a DM and I can generate your version with your own branding and style. 

# For business owners and freelancers doing social media content for clients...

This can:

* Save time making social content
* Create consistent branded visuals
* Give clients quick mockups before real shoots

If you’re running a small store, freelancing, or doing social ads, I think this is something you’ll want to test.  Anyway, madami pa ako ginawa ng mini apps, I will share them all here in the coming days.

**TL;DR:**  
  
I built a working AI social ad mockup generator using Google AI Studio + Gemini.  
It’s free, easy to replicate, and you can customize it for your business.  
Video demo attached.

1o694ug,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1o694ug/baby_hates_a_soft_boob/,Baby hates a soft boob,"My baby is 11 weeks and we’re struggling with feeds when I’m not super engorged. He seems to only like being on the boob when it’s quite full and hard, like first thing in the morning. Pretty much from the afternoon onwards, he gets fussy and upset when it’s softer, and refuses to latch even when there is milk. I don’t think I have a supply issue—I pump after these frustrating feeds and there is always a decent amount of milk there, 3-4 oz or so. 

This means we end up using bottles way more often than I would like. He takes them just fine and we use an extra slow flow nipple. Often I have to resort to a bottle just because I can’t handle 30+ minutes of screaming, wrestling and boob punching from him multiple times a day. The other day I was out having coffee with some new mom friends and I was shocked at how easily they could feed in public, whereas my baby and I ended up in a (loud) wrestling match, which he won when I caved and pulled out the bottle I’d brought 😅 I was like, ok so this isn’t everyone’s experience…

Has anyone else dealt with this? Did you figure out a way to get your baby to accept a softer boob? It’s immensely frustrating for both of us, and starting to make me sad. ",2,1760427545.0,breastfeeding,2,1.0,False

These days finding frnds is hard. People were busy in their works and no one is ready to give some time and care abt mental state. Now curious to get a female frnd.

Whenever I feel alone I'll just go to mall by, I will have some breakfast, then for a movie, lunch sometimes with biryani, sometimes in California Burrito(When I feel like i should have healty diet, XD), after that some desert may be and roaming over outfit trials and back to home.

This was ok until I started getting feel like talking with someone will make me fine. So I never tried frnd apps or dating apps cuz I don’t have any hope there..I taught I can find someone here but never tried too. Here's my first application : )

I like coffee,biryani a lot...sarcastic mostly, bit introvert, humble, honesty and a well being man in how a girl can spend her valuable time with me happily.",1,1760427510.0,Hyd_DaTinG,0,1.0,False

1o693no,https://www.reddit.com/r/rjpartnersupport/comments/1o693no/here_is_the_purpose_of_mankind_or_human_life_if/,"here is the purpose of mankind or human life, if anyone is searching after it than dont anymore","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1760427414.0,rjpartnersupport,0,1.0,False

1o6920c,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SouthAustinBubba/comments/1o6920c/south_manchaca_music_village_stinson_trail/,"South Manchaca, Music Village & Stinson Trail","Hi yall. I’ve seen some post with some misconceptions about what all is happening on South Manchaca and I though I’d take a moment to set the record straight. My name is J.R.Stinson and I’m a looong time South Austinite and a full-time Bubba. I’m the local land developer who has been focused on preserving South Manchaca Road for most of my life. 

Before I start I’d like to share a bit of background on my family’s connection to South Austin. My family patriarchs settled on farmland that is now Peter Pan Golf and Bouldin back in 1850 and 1851. Another branch of my family settled Davis Lane in the 1840’s. My great Aunt, Mollie Dawson, was one of Austin’s first female teachers and later developed many areas of what is now Bouldin. More recently we all grew up on a cattle farm on Manchaca at Davis Lane. All that land is long gone, but we still remain on Manchaca Road, hence my love and connection for  South Austin.

In 2019 my business partner came to me and asked if I had a passion project that I would like to see through realization. He said it could be anything that I really cared about. I told him that I had always wanted to preserve South Manchaca from becoming overran with dull boring whitewashed apartments and national restaurant chains. As many of you know this area was never annexed into the city limits which attracted many entertainment venues. The only problem was it was not very walkable and is next to a 55 MPH highway. Unfortunately the area has experienced a lot of pedestrian fatalities over the years due to the lack of sidewalks.

Through many restless nights of studying the area maps I realized that most of the lots surrounding Moontower Saloon had a back line that almost made a perfect line. Could this back line become a pedestrian trail tucked safe away from the speeding cars? It would take us many years to find out. So in 2020 we began purchasing as much land in the area just south of Slaughter Lane as we could get in an effort to connect up the proposed trail path.

The area currently is home to Sam’s Town Point, Armadillo Den, Moontower Saloon, Bouldin Acres South, MSB, Reset Bar, Lulu’s, Bohdi’s Hideout, The Hive, Drifter’s Social, Pickle Hub, and SABG. I hear that Cosmic Coffee, Rush Racket Sports, and a lit par 3 golf attraction are soon to open in the area as well. The energy is gathering for sure.

We met with County Comissioners and City Council members in an effort to figure this much needed pedestrian path out. The only problem was that Travis County development code really didn’t offer a way to create a contiguous and useful place for a safe pedestrian passage anytime in the near future. So we got busy with neighbors to buy or borrow their back line to make a proposed .9 mile walking trail that could connect land on Slaughter lane near Sam’s all the way down to the Slaughter Creek trail system. Most neighbors were delighted to contribute land, while others have been less interested in the idea. All in all we only have one small section that has held out, but we are hopeful that the new land owners will join our efforts soon as they seem to me much brighter than the last lady.

In November of 2024 I filed a petition to remove the area by election from the Austin ETJ, a move that would allow for simpler funding and permitting timelines for the trail development. The area still has the same environmental water quality standards that it had before, same impervious cover limits, and we have all voluntarily decided to dedicate any previously protected live oaks trees into permanent protection through deed restrictions. This was really important to me because I’m a tree hugger and nature enthusiast, some might better describe me as a cowboy hippie, but regardless TREES  ARE IMPORTANT!

The area really doesn’t have an official name, but due to the amount of venues in the area it has been proposed that we adopt Music Village as the new namesake. So that’s the name I’m promoting. 

As we enter into 2026 soon I will be building and opening the first section of the trail from Slaughter creek to Lynnbrook Drive. Currently we are self funding the segments of the project but would love it if some local philanthropist or businesses might want to partner with us on this effort. The trail will also feature space for farmers market and vintage trading booths plus much more area parking. I plan to add community chess tables along the trail as well. At the south end of the trails proposed path it will terminate into the Slaughter Creek trail system, which COA has proposed to expand to connect to East Austin trail systems and westward to the Violet Crown Trail. Due to the coming sports attractions we hope to become an outdoors recreational destination.

My hope is that this area will be preserved from big development for many more generations to come and that it will become a hub for community connection for all Austinites.

I have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in effort to environmentally engineer and plan the trail, and will be donating over two acres of land to see this effort through. Selfishly I plan to name the trail sections that I am donating after my late father, Ned Stinson, a lifelong public educator who taught drivers education at Crockett High School until his death in 1991. He cared a lot about public safety and building community in South Austin.

So the next time you pass by the Stinson Trail sign on South Manchaca don’t wonder if this is some dickhead trying to Vegas your South Austin. We are just trying to raise awareness that this area needs critical infrastructure and also trying to promote locally owned businesses that can stave off big development for many more decades to come. Someone recently told me that “South Austin is all of the real Austin that we have left”, and it made me tear up a bit… but then I went to Sam’s where I danced and smiled all night long remembering that we still have this little slice of what Austin used to be about. 

So I welcome your comments and criticism  here publicly and privately. I realize this isn’t every person’s  ideal outcome for the area. You won’t hurt my feelings. I welcome new ideas that could enhance this all. I welcome your assistance if you’d like to help my efforts somehow. Please feel free to reach out anytime neighbor.

1o691zp,https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/1o691zp/some_things_that_actually_helped_me_live_better/,Some things that actually helped me live better with eczema 💬,"Hey guys, just wanted to hop back here with a little update. I’ve had eczema pretty much my whole life, and at some point you just start figuring things out on your own, you know? I’m not a doctor, but I’ve learned a few things the hard way, and maybe some of it might help someone else out there.

For me, food makes a huge difference. If I eat a lot of lamb, spicy stuff, green onions, garlic, or shellfish, my skin almost always freaks out. Same with too much coffee — I love it, but my skin clearly doesn’t. So now I just go easier on those things, especially when my skin’s already irritated.

Another thing I never cared about before was air quality. One day I opened my AC filter and honestly… it was disgusting. I had no idea it got that gross. Now I clean it regularly and keep an air purifier in my bedroom. It’s not a cure, but it actually helps keep things calmer.

Food-wise, I try to eat cleaner when I’m having flare-ups. More fresh stuff, less fried food. If I can, I’ll go organic. Not gonna lie, it’s boring sometimes — but my skin behaves better when I’m not living off takeout.

Also, I’ve mentioned this before: I use a Kaiyan red light device at home. It’s not a medical treatment, but when I use it every day, it really does help me calm the inflammation down. I use red light (630–660 nm) and near-infrared (800–850 nm). But honestly, if you can’t keep it up daily, it’s probably not gonna do much.

That’s what I’ve got for now. I’m sure there’ll be more things I think of later, and I’ll keep sharing as I go. Thanks for reading — hope it helps someone. ❤️",7,1760427228.0,eczema,5,1.0,False

I told my husband my leave is up until mid November, then he made a comment how I should return to work when my LOA is over.

Driving is painful, sweeping and sitting down for too long is a problem too and I have this on and off diziness sometimes comes in randomly.

Now, it's been a couple years since I played, and I've ran into maaaany bugs, especially bugs relating to Inventory, losing items randomly, or items not updating, and ruining any plans to move items around between stations. So i have a couple questions:  
\- Do you like the Idea?  
\- Will you order if you see the Food Truck in chat?  
\- Am I going to be a victim to pirates, who will take over the truck to eat all my hot-dogs that i painstakingly collected one click at a time?  
\- Would you tip the player, for the effort of collecting all the tasty foods and deliver it to your super remote location?  
\- is there a cool place you would love to see the Food-Truck park at to hand out hot dogs to the hungry? maybe a popular spot with lots of players that doesn't have local food stands? (i haven't interacted much with the worlds outside of the stations & missions).

Also, are there any mechanics i should be aware of? I'm not sure how hailing works, i never used the ingame voicechat, so I'll look into that. I assume people say they want to order, and I invite them (or they invite me) into a Party chat, so i can find their coordinates and jump towards them to make the deliveries.  
If you have any more additional tips & tricks to avoid bugs, or make interactions with Players better - both for me & for them - and more immersive, please let me know!",6,1760426782.0,starcitizen,4,0.8,False

# Introduction

Picture this: mornings across millions of homes, offices, and hotels begin with the whistle of boiling water. From quick tea and coffee preparation to instant noodles, soups, and even baby food, electric kettles have quietly become an everyday necessity worldwide. With the fast-paced lifestyle of urban consumers, this product has transformed from a luxury to a household essential.

In this article, we will explore why electric kettle manufacturing is a lucrative business opportunity in 2026, covering its profitability, market demand, competitors, manufacturing process, raw material requirements, government support, and how professional consultancy can help you succeed.

# Why This Industry Is Profitable

* **Lifestyle Shift:** Urbanization, dual-income households, and a preference for convenience products have skyrocketed demand.
* **Rising Middle Class:** Emerging economies like India, China, and Southeast Asia are experiencing a surge in middle-class consumers.
* **Export Potential:** Demand for small kitchen appliances is rising globally, with electric kettles being a fast-growing category.
* **Low Per Capita Penetration in India:** Unlike Europe, where electric kettles are a staple, penetration in India and Asian countries is still growing, offering untapped potential.

The logic is simple: low manufacturing complexity + high consumer demand = profitable venture.

# Current Players in the Market

The electric kettle segment has a mix of global giants and local manufacturers. Some of the leading brands include:

* **Philips** – Premium and mid-segment products.
* **Prestige & Bajaj** – Indian market leaders in household appliances.
* **Morphy Richards** – Focused on stylish, high-quality designs.
* **Kent, Havells, and Butterfly** – Strong presence in affordable and mid-range categories.
* **Chinese OEMs** – Supplying to global retailers with private label branding.

The competitive landscape shows that local manufacturing units can capture market share by targeting affordability, customization, and regional needs.

# Market Demand, Growth Rate & Static Data

* **Global Electric Kettle Market Size (2024):** USD 4.3 billion.
* **Forecast (2030):** USD 6.9 billion.
* **CAGR:** \~7.9% (2024–2030).
* **Indian Market Growth:** Expected CAGR of **9–10%** driven by e-commerce penetration, rising disposable income, and preference for energy-efficient appliances.

Additionally, imports from China dominate 60% of the Indian market, opening opportunities for domestic manufacturers to bridge the supply gap.

# Applications & End-Users

Electric kettles are not limited to homes. They are widely used in:

* **Households** – Tea, coffee, boiling water, instant meals.
* **Offices & Workspaces** – Quick beverages and soups.
* **Hotels & Hospitality** – In-room appliances for guests.
* **Food Outlets & Cafeterias** – Preparing instant beverages.
* **Healthcare & Baby Care** – Sterilizing water, formula preparation.

This versatility ensures consistent and diversified demand.

# Manufacturing Process Overview

Electric kettle manufacturing involves the following steps:

1. **Design & Mold Development** – Shape and size finalized.
2. **Plastic Molding** – Body and handle production through injection molding.
3. **Metal Fabrication** – Stainless steel inner lining and heating plate assembly.
4. **Heating Element Integration** – Electrical coil and thermostat fixing.
5. **Electrical Wiring & Assembly** – Power cord, switch, and auto-cutoff integration.
6. **Quality Testing** – Leakage, heating efficiency, and safety checks.
7. **Packaging** – Branding, boxing, and logistics.

# Raw Material Requirements & Sourcing

Key raw materials include:

* **Plastic Granules (PP, ABS)** – For outer body and handle.
* **Stainless Steel Sheets** – For the inner container.
* **Heating Elements** – Nichrome coil and thermostat.
* **Wiring & Electrical Components** – Switches, power cords.
* **Packaging Materials** – Printed cartons, labels.

**Sourcing Tip:** Plastic and steel are widely available in India through industrial hubs like Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu. Heating elements can be imported or sourced locally from suppliers in Pune, Delhi, and Bangalore.

# Machinery & Plant Setup

A small-to-medium scale unit requires:

* Injection Molding Machines (for plastic parts)
* Sheet Metal Forming & Welding Machines
* Assembly Line Tools
* Testing & QC Equipment
* Packaging Machines

**Space Requirement:** 5,000–10,000 sq. ft., depending on scale. Automation: Semi-automatic setups work well for MSMEs; larger players may opt for fully automated lines.

# Government Support / Subsidies / MSME Schemes

Indian entrepreneurs can benefit from multiple schemes, such as:

* **PMEGP (Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Program)** – Subsidized loans.
* **MSME Schemes for Technology Upgradation** – Helps with machinery purchase.
* **PLI Scheme for White Goods** – Covers components like heating elements and controls.
* **Startup India Recognition** – Tax and compliance benefits.
* **Export Promotion Schemes** – Duty drawback for exporters.

# Challenges & Risks + Mitigation

* **Competition from Imports:** Chinese suppliers dominate the low-cost segment. → **Mitigation:** Focus on quality, local branding, and after-sales service.
* **Price Sensitivity in the Indian Market:** Consumers often choose the cheapest option. → **Mitigation:** Introduce value-for-money products in multiple price brackets.
* **Regulatory Compliance:** BIS certification and safety standards are mandatory. → **Mitigation:** Partner with consultants to handle compliance smoothly.

# Conclusion

The electric kettle industry in 2026 is buzzing with potential. With rapid lifestyle changes, booming demand, government support, and increasing domestic consumption, now is the perfect time to invest in this sector.

If you are ready to explore this opportunity, act now—because the early movers always capture the largest share of the market.

1o68wuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/privatehealthcoveruk/comments/1o68wuz/vitality_health_private_insurance_explained/,Vitality Health Private Insurance Explained,"For anyone researching private health insurance options in the UK, Vitality is a provider that often comes up due to its unique approach. Here’s a brief summary of how their model works.

Unlike many traditional insurers, Vitality is built around a 'Shared Value' concept. The idea is to proactively reward members for living a healthier lifestyle, which in turn can reduce long-term claim risks for the insurer.

The system works through a cycle of engagement:
- You track healthy activities (like steps, gym visits, or health checks) using the Vitality app.
- These activities earn you 'Vitality Points'.
- Points help you move up a status ladder, from Bronze to Platinum, over your policy year.
- Your status and weekly activity unlock rewards like free coffees, cinema tickets, and discounts on gym memberships or an Apple Watch.
- Achieving a higher status may also help reduce your premium increase at renewal, though other factors like age and medical inflation still apply.

It's important to remember that beneath the wellness programme, it is a comprehensive private medical insurance policy designed to provide cover for acute conditions, similar to other major UK providers.

These insights are based on our latest guide which explores the provider in more detail.

For those in the community with a Vitality policy, what has your experience been with balancing the activity tracking against the value of the rewards and the core cover?

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

My friend is turning 50 November 10th and my birthday is November 15th (not turning 50). I just got a text message from his wife today who is also my friend, letting me know that they are having a party for him on my birthday and I’m invited and it was the only weekend they could have it. I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do for my birthday as I was still figuring out what would be fun (its a month away) and we share alot of the same friends who are invited to his party. It sucks because they never mentioned anything to me prior. They said they were sorry. And when I was like well thats a bummer maybe we can do something to celebrate my birthday on an adjacent day his wife responded, “Yeah let’s plan a dinner or something like that as a double bday for the two of you”.

Well Im thinking…can you make your party a double birthday since it is on my actually birthday!?! (I didn’t say that but felt it). Anyway I am super annoyed and I am having a hard processing my feelings about it. Advice would be appreciated. Thank you!",0,1760426080.0,Advice,21,0.5,False

I had a Roomba I7+ with the auto empty and I love it but it was starting to crap out on me, I did some research(annoyed)and chased for some upgrades, go for flow finally.

Yesterday I saw it ranked 2 in 2025 Vacuum War roundup, also hope to give you my experience.

**The Good:**

1. ***convenient:*** The auto-fill and self-cleaning impressed. Cuts down so much housekeeping time. Love that it works diligently even when I'm out.
2. ***cleans well:*** I have it run every other day. Floors stay dust-free, can walk around barefoot without feeling grit, and it handles dried-up coffee spills without leaving streaks
3. ***no hair tangels(seriously):*** This was their big selling point and it delivers. I have two shedding cats, it’s been a lifesaver. I used to constantly pull hair out of my old robot's roller, but with this one, it's a non-issue. Zero clogs or tangles so far. 

**The Not-So-Good:**

1. The dock is pretty massive, so you need to plan where to put it. 
2. The app has a learning curve.

Over all, I am satisfied with it. Hope it can maintain long-term good use.",4,1760426073.0,RobotVacuums,2,1.0,False

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

Catfished by a 50+ man.","I matched with somebody I thought was really funny and witty in the conversations. We were on the same page about meeting quickly, as in a week after matching online.

The first red flag was him being annoyed that I was running 10 minutes late due to being in an Uber. I mean it’s just 10 minutes in the scheme of things om a Sunday, but also I’m getting a $20 Uber to have an iced coffee with him for a date and $20 Uber back)

When I arrived to the café, I almost walked right past him. This man showed up to our date as a 50 something year-old wearing shorts, plastic slides, and a shirt that was collared. I instantly regretted wearing a nice dress heels and putting makeup and jewelry on for a Sunday afternoon date.

Now, this is where things take a turn. I noticed that he was much older than all of the photos in his profile, and he conveniently unmatched us before our date so I didn’t have any reference photos of him when I say older this is what I mean (his profile said 50, he said 51 but I suspect 54) : a lot of hair in the photos, thinning, greasy hair on the date, a big beer belly that when he came in to hug me, the tummy reached me before his arms did, face skin that is so sun damaged, wrinkled, thin lips he may have been ok looking when younger but ridiculously unkempt- now if he had been pleasant, I get it we all have insecurities. It would be OK, but this man loves the sound of his own voice kept calling me darling, and honey kept talking over me and was generally a bit handsy. 

I wasn’t even halfway through my iced coffee when he asked me where this was going, and if I would consider dating him and I was like” I’ve known you for 15 minutes.”  Anyway, I asked him to pull up his profile on his phone and asked genuinely, do you think you look like any of these photos today ? How long were these photos taken , though? I don’t think you look like this anymore and I went through each of these photos some of which featured blonde hair and  now has brown hair, some which featured thick hair and a slim body versus a really old guy‘s body with thinning grey greasy hair. Am I just super vain? 

I just feel like women get so much shit for looking a little bit unlike their profile photos whether they’ve changed their hairstyle or put on 2 to 5 kg and don’t look exactly like the bikini photo that when this man who I’m sure would not spare anybody if the roles were reversed duped me I felt so annoyed.

In the first photo L-R: Lagom P64, P80, 01. Second photo L-R: Lagom 01, Casa, Mini. 3rd photo: CMT’s showroom, showing only a fraction of the gear they had on display.

Sam at Option-O was a gracious host. We brewed a light roast as V60 ground with Casa, P80 with stock Mizzen 800M burrs, and 01 with SSP 102 HU burrs. My favorite was the P80 with the Casa a close 2nd. I guess I’m not a fan of the 102 HU burrs, as the coffee brewed with them tasted overly harsh. Maybe the coffee needed to be dialed in differently with those burrs. We also brewed a medium roast ground on the P80 as espresso using a Decent with a lever profile, which was delicious.

I was very impressed with the P80. It is just a smidge larger than the P64, and it is hard to tell them apart. Burrs are extremely easy to swap. Most steel burrs can be magnetically attached; the burr carriers have pins that go through the screw holes of the burrs to prevent them from rotating on the carriers. The exit chute is cleverly designed to also act as a knocker to dislodge grinds. It looks to me like a big improvement over the P64 for the same price.

# Chapter 1

Author: Rainie Ray

The agony of the iron rod through my chest still lingered, and each breath felt like it tore me apart from the inside. 

Just then, Rebecca Smith's voice, sweet and pleading, filled the room. 

""Dad, I have someone else in my heart. Marrying him–I just can't do it."" 

In my previous life, I had fallen for her Oscar-worthy act and stepped in to take her place without a second thought. In this life, though, I refused to fall for it. I simply watched her perform, my lips pressed firmly in a tight line. 

The room tensed up for a beat. 

Dad–Nash Smith–knitted his brows, his mind obviously racing through the odds. 

I braced myself for a repeat of the past, but then Calvin Porter's icy voice cut through the quiet. 

He moved closer, his eyes briefly softening as they passed over Rebecca, then turned icy again when they landed on me. 

""Mr. Smith, I didn't come here to talk about weddings."" 

Rebecca let out a relieved breath. 

I blinked in surprise. Was it possible Calvin had a second chance at life too? 

""And what brings you here?"" asked Nash. 

Calvin's face was a mask of humility. ""The Porter family went broke, no longer fit for Rebecca. If I can't turn things around in three years, let's call off the marriage deal. Fair?"" 

The air shifted, charged with unspoken thoughts. 

Rebecca drifted closer to me, as if by accident, and as she brushed by, my coffee cup tumbled to the floor. 

She crashed down after it, a perfect picture of distress. 

""Ahh!"" 

Her scream pierced the air, her hand turning a bright, angry red. 

It all happened too fast for me to react. 

A second later, I felt a heavy thud against my shoulder. 

Stumbling backward from the forceful shove, a throbbing pain spread across my shoulder blades as my vision momentarily darkened. 

""How could you be so cruel, Joanna?"" he bellowed with fury. ""I chose Rebecca. If you've got a problem, take it up with me. If you dare hurt Rebecca again, you and I are going to have serious issues."" 

I had never seen such raw anger in his eyes. 

My heart clenched as if gripped by an unseen force, a pain sharper than the memory of a past life's car crash, where a metal rod had impaled me. 

I let out a bitter chuckle. So, he had truly been reborn. 

Digging my nails into my palms, the sharp sting helped me cling to the last threads of my composure. 

Well, at least then he could openly stand by his precious Rebecca. 

However, what he did not realize was that without that fool who was me, blazing trails and clearing hurdles for him, I wondered if he could find success so swiftly again.",1,1760424965.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

Bru became my go-to for a while… until I tried Davidoff. And again, I was like, “What the hell was I drinking before?!” 

Today at the office, I ran out of my Davidoff and had to make a cup using Bru — and OMG, it tasted horrible. I couldn’t even finish it.

We went on two dates, and things felt great.

Before our second date, she wanted to stop talking after a small disagreement. I said ""okay"" because I knew how emotional I am. But then she insisted on meeting face-to-face to explain herself, saying she didn’t want to leave things unfinished.

During the second date, we got physically close, and everything felt natural, emotional and physical chemistry were both strong. Just a few days later, she suddenly ended things, saying career opportunity in about 5 months, in another city might make us upset in the future, so it’s better to stop now and she said that things in her life were ""too uncertain"" right now. It felt like a very small and unclear reason to cut off a relationship that had just started and where we were already close.

Afterwards I texted her, told her I understood what she’s going through and that I could give her time, but I also said I didn’t want to lose the connection we had.

She said:

“I think the decision we made yesterday was right. I’m in a period where I only want to focus on work. I don’t want to hurt you more, so I think it’s best if we stop communicating.”

What confuses me is that she was the one who made plans with me, like inviting me to a concert next month. How can someone go from that to completely cutting things off in just a few days?

I really liked her, and we had something that felt rare, not just attraction but emotional connection too. I can’t tell if she genuinely got scared or just lost interest.

1o68e14,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_monsacparis/comments/1o68e14/from_coffee_runs_to_date_nights_the_shoulder_bag/,From Coffee Runs to Date Nights: The Shoulder Bag That Fits Every Scene,"A [women's shoulder bag](https://monsacparis.com/collections/collection-de-sacs-a-bandouliere-femme) has a strange way of fitting into nearly every moment. You sling it on for a quick walk to grab coffee. It hangs easy when you’re weaving through the city at noon. And somehow, the same bag works when the lights dim and it’s time for dinner. No switching, no stress.

Why Women Reach for Shoulder Bags

Be honest—how often do you really want to carry something heavy in your hands? Not often, right. That’s the quiet reason shoulder bags stick around. They keep the basics close—phone, wallet, lipstick—while letting your hands stay free.

· They don’t weigh you down the way a tote can.

· They move with you, not against you.

· They finish an outfit without screaming for attention.

· They feel right in both casual jeans or a black dress.

Shifting From Day to Night

Morning calls for a light shade, something soft like beige or pastel pink. Evening calls for black, maybe bronze, maybe even a bold red if you feel it. A good women’s shoulder bag doesn’t demand you swap midway through the day. One strap and you’re covered from sun-up to last call.

Color Choices Tell Their Own Story

Some days you want calm. That’s when beige, light grey, or soft pink feel safe. Other times you want presence. That’s when green or red feels right. Bags carry

mood, same as clothes. And honestly, it helps to have a few colors on standby—saves that last-minute panic before stepping out.

Material That Lasts (Or Feels Light)

Leather-look pieces have a kind of old-world charm. They last if you care for them. Fabric blends are lighter, better for long summer afternoons. Some bags mix textures—bit of shine here, matte finish there—which feels modern, even playful. Pick the one that feels like you, not just what’s trending this week.

Details You Notice Later

At first, you see style. Later, you notice the little things. Adjustable straps that stop slipping off your shoulder. Hidden pockets for coins, cards, or secrets. Snap buttons that don’t fuss. Models like Amber or Silvia carry these touches quietly, making the bag part of daily rhythm instead of a chore.

How Do You Know It’s Right for You?

Ask simple stuff. Do you carry books or a laptop often? Then size up. Do you like traveling light, just a phone and keys? Then smaller, compact shapes fit better. Think about how long the bag will stay on your shoulder in a day. That answer tells you more than any label.

Closing Thought

A [women’s shoulder bag](https://monsacparis.com/collections/collection-de-sacs-a-bandouliere-femme) is less about fashion rules and more about freedom. It moves when you move. It holds what you need, and sometimes, it carries a little mood too. From morning coffee lines to late-night walks, it’s there.

Most days I’m running between classes and shifts, and by the time I get a moment to myself, I usually just crash or scroll through my phone. Lately, I started thinking about how to use those rare free hours more productively and maybe earn a bit of extra money.

A friend of mine, who’s really into crypto, mentioned an online project he was experimenting with. He was excited about it and said it only runs until October 20, which immediately made me curious. I’ve tried a few “quick money” ideas before, most of which ended up being total wastes of time, so I wasn’t expecting much. But I figured, why not spend an hour figuring it out?

I set aside some time after a late-night shift, grabbed a cup of coffee, and started going through the instructions. Honestly, it took a little trial to understand the process, but once I got the hang of it, things started falling into place. By the end of the evening, I was surprised to see that I had made about $200 on my very first day. I double-checked everything because it didn’t feel real

I battled you in my battle with him. I've had her back. They took her back. I've had her back. They took her back. I'm just a wits end people and they're trying to take my daughter trying to take my parental rights away. This story is so complicated in so long. Okay I'll start here on the 9th of June 8th 2023. My wife is fried Chicken. I'd come in from work. Had mud on my feet. Went into the bedroom where I had white carpets and I got black mud in the carpets. Well the normal steam cleaner didn't get it out so I went to the kitchen told my wife I was going to the shop to get my gas powered pressure washer and my Shop-Vac and get that stain out the carpet and she said okay. You got plenty of time. I'm frying chicken well when I got back I went in the bedroom, raise the window, cut the ceiling fan on shut the door cranked up the gas power pressure washer and commence it cleaning inside my carpets. Well I guess it's about 15 minutes in. I started feeling dizzy and nauseous and just headache and I said oh my God I got carbon monoxide poison out so I shut everything down I walked out the bedroom. The one looked down the highway. My wife was having a heart attack on the couch. She'd been diagnosed with congestive heart failure a year and a half before and so I run over there to her kneel down in front of her and it was pretty bad so I was going to run to the kitchen cabinet. Get the phone call 911 I guess from the carbon monoxide poisoning and standing up so quick I passed out people and passed out for 4 and 1/2 hours. I passed out with my left leg. I folded under me and I guess I'm not sure. Maybe maybe hit the coffee table or the floor but I've been lacerated the back left half from my tongue. Couldn't talk when I came to it felt like I've been hit with a car. My hips hurt so bad. I still have no damage in my left leg. When I came to my wife was passed and my daughter was asleep in her lap. I couldn't get her all and it hurt too bad so it got to the phone call. 911 told him what was up and they came. But when they get there you got a bald-headed guy and a tank. Top wife beater boxers can't walk. Can't talk leave people. I'm tattooed from the head to the toe cuz I can't walk and talk this man. As soon as I'm f***** up and it took my child. I actually had carbon monoxide poisoning and that's where it all started now a little over 2 years later they told me when my best option would be in Louisiana with my people cuz I lost everything in North Dakota fighting. So come down here to Louisiana and the lady down here with ICPc because she didn't know I was from here. She thought I just moved  from fargo. and I told her look if you did your job right  you would  know I'm from here. So since  she rejected the ICPc North Dakota is trying to take my parental rights because of that. No no. I came to Louisiana and meant all the requirements. I got a ride to place a job. Their name. Trying to fight to get her to me now. I'm in Louisiana. They're in North Dakota and I'm exhausted all my resources. Can somebody please help me? Give me some advice

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

For the most part, I love al(most) my customers. Super easy going and friendly. Every now and then, I get a real peach which leads me to sharing this story.

I had a customer come up and request a birthday drink which I love doing and asking for upgrades since birthday drinks are free and I have no problem doing. But this lady….she was super annoying about it. If you can picture a lady straight out of the Jersey Shore cast with the Valley Girl accent, that was this customer.

In two minutes, this lady kept saying super loud in the store that it was her birthday. I’m good at ignoring people that get super irritating in general when I can but her husband and daughter met with her and with the tone in her voice, she was being super condescending and rude to the both of them. I ignored most of it as that is there conversation but I couldn’t help but hear one thing and I slightly turned my head and saw the disgruntled face on her husband.

Her: You have to be nice to me for a few more hours because it’s my birthday!
Her husband: You’re making it very difficult right now.

I finish making the drinks and hand them off. This lady had the audacity to say to me, “You didn’t wish me a happy birthday.” I looked at her and said, “Well if you weren’t such a bitch to your husband and kept announcing it like you’re the queen of England, I would have.” I have never seen a more happy husband with his wife getting coffee like someone finally stuck up for him but then again, I’m always trying to make people’s day better.",18,1760424342.0,EntitledPeople,6,0.69,False

Hi! I’m looking for somebody to take over my lease for a room in a fully furnished, 2-bedroom, 1-bathroom apartment on the corner of 2nd Street and Armory. 

**Great location!** Centrally located between the Quad, Green Street, Ikenberry / ARC. Also located close to night & Greek life without all the noise!

**One block away from First & Armory bus stop with the 22 Illini / 14 Navy.** The 22 travels most of campus, and the 14 can take you directly to Illinois Terminal for easy transfers to non-campus lines. Also located 2 blocks away from the 1 Yellow and 10 Gold bus stops, which have easy access to Enginering Quad + the mall, and Urbana (respectively). 

**Included amenities:** Fully furnished, in-unit washer & dryer, dishwasher, coffee maker, toaster, rice cooker, full-size oven, balcony, flatscreen TV, central heating and cooling, individual locking bedrooms, detachable showerhead, etc.

I have one outgoing and friendly roommate. The landlord also hosts gatherings every so often like cookouts, and the overall management group is kind and understanding.

**Rent: $875.00 a month, with ALL utilities included.** Yes, this means water, sewer, recycling, etc.

**Other notes:** There is a $200 sublease fee to transfer the lease (background checks , credit check, etc.) and for cleaning between my move out / your move in. This is negotiable! Leases are individual, so my roommates lease is not tied to yours and vice-versa. The lease is for the full year until July 31, 2026.

I don’t believe in telling ghost stories, I don’t read creepypasta, and I sure as hell don’t sit around watching YouTube videos with red circles and arrows pointing at blurry shadows.

But lately, I’ve been thinking about the old lunatic asylum. And I think I just need to write it all out.

This happened back in 1987. I was twenty-four and broke, living in a shoebox-sized studio apartment above a pawn shop on Lorain Avenue, near West 41st in Cleveland. I had no job, no girlfriend, and no idea what I was doing with my life — just a mattress and a black-and-white TV sitting on a milk crate, and a growing pile of unopened bills from Columbia House because I thought twelve cassette tapes for a penny was a good deal.

Fresh off a 120-hour security course at Wooster Business College, I was desperate enough to answer a sun-faded flyer stapled to a telephone pole. It read:

**NIGHT SECURITY – $9.75/hr**  
**CALL ED // 555-6913**

Now, $9.75 an hour in 1987? That was serious money for a guy like me. Most warehouse shifts paid maybe six. I figured it was a scam or some shady private security thing where you had to shake down teenagers for smoking pot in parking lots.

I called the number anyway.

The guy who answered sounded old. His voice had that phlegmy smoker rasp, like he’d been yelling at factory machines for forty years. Said his name was Ed something — I never caught the last name — and told me to come down to the office to fill out an application.

First thing the next morning, I headed straight to the address he rattled off over the phone — Denison Security Associates.

The office sat between a furniture store and a pawn shop. The windows were coated with so much nicotine residue you could barely see inside. The door handle was cold and loose, and a paper sign taped to the glass said **RING FOR ENTRY.**

Inside, the air was thick with the smell of stale coffee, copier toner, and floor wax. A woman with bleached hair and too much eyeliner sat behind the desk, smoking while she typed on a beige IBM keyboard. She didn’t even look up when I came in.

“You here for work?” she asked, ash trembling at the end of her cigarette.

“Yeah. Got my certification a couple of weeks ago.”

“Firearms certified?”

“Yeah.”

She nodded and slid a clipboard across the counter. “Fill that out. Don’t miss the social or they won’t pay you.”

Halfway through the form, a voice from the back shouted, “You certified, kid?”

I held up the blue paper.

“Good enough. C’mon back.”

The man behind the voice was short, thick around the middle, with a tie that had been knotted since 1975. He sat behind a desk piled with clipboards and spare radios. A sign taped to the wall read **DON’T CALL OFF — DEAD IS THE ONLY EXCUSE.**

He looked me up and down. “Got your own piece?”

“Yeah.”

“What kind?”

“.38 revolver. Smith & Wesson.”

He grunted approval. “Good. No paperwork nightmare there. You can start tonight. Cleveland Developmental Center. Graveyard shift. It’s city property, quiet as a tomb. Just don’t fall asleep. They like to check the boiler logs every morning.”

I nodded like I understood what that meant.

He opened a narrow closet, rummaged through a rack of blue shirts, and handed me one still wrapped in plastic. “You’re a large, right?”

“Medium.”

He handed me the large anyway. “Don’t wash it in hot water. They shrink.”

Then he grinned, a yellow-toothed smirk that made the fluorescent light catch the sweat on his forehead.  
“Welcome to Denison Security Associates, kid.”

I walked out of **DSA** with a half-folded application in my back pocket, a navy-blue uniform shirt in a dry cleaner bag slung over my shoulder, and the name *Cleveland Developmental Center* scribbled on a neon pink Post-it note that was already curling at the edges from my palm sweat.

The air outside smelled like wet concrete and car exhaust. There was a dead pigeon by the curb, wing outstretched like it had been halfway through a dramatic monologue before it keeled over.

The Nova was parked where I left it — two spots away from a broken vending machine and across from a chain-link fence holding back three angry dogs and a rusted-out boat on blocks.

I tossed the uniform shirt onto the passenger seat like it might bite me.

Sat there a moment, keys in hand.

No handshake. No formalities. Just “You’re hired.”

That was it.

**No orientation. No tour. No warning.**

I started the car. The engine rattled like a dying shopping cart.

The drive home took fifteen minutes, most of it spent squinting through a cracked windshield that smeared light like bad mascara. The heat barely worked. I aimed the vents at the fogged glass and hoped for the best.

Lorain Avenue looked like it always did in late afternoon — gray, half asleep, stripped of anything hopeful. Corner stores with hand-painted signs. Check cashing joints with paper signs taped inside the windows. Men with sunken eyes and gas station coffee leaning against brick walls like they were waiting for a bus that never came.

When I turned onto my block near West 41st, the sky was already starting to bruise. The clouds were low and heavy, tinged yellow near the edges like they were stained from the inside.

My building sat above a pawn shop that never seemed open, even when the lights were on. The windows were covered with steel mesh and sun-bleached flyers for broken guitars and out-of-box VCRs. The hallway to the stairs always smelled like old lettuce and carpet glue.

The walk up felt longer than usual.

Every step echoed.

My studio apartment had enough room for a mattress, a hot plate, and a dented microwave that sparked if you looked at it wrong. The floor sloped toward the bathroom like the whole place was slowly sinking. You could hear every neighbor sneeze, argue, or flush. I’d lived there for six months and still didn’t know anyone’s name.

I kicked off my shoes, dropped the uniform on the mattress, and sat on the edge of it with my jacket still on.

I didn’t unpack.

Didn’t hang the shirt up.

 I spent the rest of that day sitting on my mattress, chain-smoking Marlboro lights and watching static on the little black-and-white TV I kept on a milk crate. I found myself glancing at the clock way too often, like I was waiting for something to happen. A phone call canceling the whole thing. A knock on the door.

Anything.

By the time the sun dipped below the rooftops outside, the apartment had that dull, blue-grey light that made everything feel underwater. I put on my uniform, threw on my beat-up leather jacket, and pocketed my last working flashlight — the fat metal kind that took four D batteries and could double as a weapon if you held it right.

Then I grabbed my keys and headed down the stairs to my car.

The drive out there took longer than I expected. Cleveland traffic at night isn’t bad, but the Developmental Center was tucked way down on the southeast side, past the factories and the strip malls and into that weird no-man’s land where you start seeing houses with boarded windows and half-collapsed porches. The kind of neighborhoods where nobody trick-or-treated anymore.

I had to check the address twice. The place didn’t show up on my glovebox road atlas, and MapQuest wasn’t a thing yet. All I had was a scrap of paper with some directions scribbled in red ink.

By the time I hit Ridgewood, my headlights were catching bits of trash rolling across the road — newspapers, snack bags, a busted umbrella. The trees lining the street were tall and tangled, casting shadows across the pavement like fingers reaching for the car.

I thought I was lost until I saw the gate.

It was massive — wrought iron, rusted, with a padlocked chain dangling uselessly from one side. Someone had spray-painted over the original “CLEVELAND DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER” lettering, but the outline still bled through like an old bruise. Beneath it, a plywood sign read:

**EMPLOYEES ONLY**

A single orange light flickered above it.

I pulled through the open side gate — someone had clearly cut the chain — and found myself driving into what looked like an entire ghost town.

The cottages were the first thing I saw. A half a dozen of them. Little one-story buildings circling the old asylum. I guess they were meant to be patient housing back in the day, or maybe halfway homes — I’m not sure. But now? Every window was either broken or boarded, every yard overgrown with yellow grass and car-sized weeds. A few still had swing sets or rusted lawn chairs out front, frozen in place like some invisible family had vanished mid-picnic.

I slowed down as I passed. Even with the windows rolled up, it felt like I was driving through something heavy. Like the air itself didn’t want me there.

Then I saw it.

The main asylum building.

Even in the dark, it looked huge. Bigger than I imagined. Five stories tall, built in that old 19th-century gothic style with pointed roofs and narrow windows that made the whole thing look like it was glaring at you. Part of the top floor had caved in — I could see where the roof had collapsed, like a giant had stomped on it — and ivy had swallowed half the brickwork. Every window on the second and third floor was black, but not empty-black. More like **watching**\-black. If that makes any sense.

It was a building that looked like it remembered every scream it had ever heard.

I drove past it without slowing down.

The actual security office was in a newer building — maybe 1960s or 70s construction. A squat, single-floor box with ugly yellow brick and that gravel tar roof every school had when I was a kid. A flickering fluorescent light buzzed above the entrance, and one of the ceiling tiles inside looked like it had fallen through, leaving a dark hole that stared back at me.

There were two cars in the parking lot: a white city-issued station wagon with “CLEVELAND DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER” stenciled on the side, and a beat-up Dodge Dart with one red door.

I parked next to the Dart.

Inside, it was warmer than I expected. The building smelled like old coffee, Pine-Sol, and something else — mildew, maybe. There was a long desk with a battered clipboard on it, a corkboard full of outdated notices, and a row of old black-and-white monitors buzzing faintly behind a wire mesh cage. The screens cycled through grainy camera feeds — mostly dark corridors, empty stairwells, and the occasional flicker of static.

The only light came from a tiny desk lamp and a vending machine humming in the corner. The kind with buttons that clunked when you pushed them and a soda can dropped like a rock into a metal tray.

The guy I was relieving stood up when I walked in.

He was taller than me, with a soft paunch under his security windbreaker and the look of someone who smoked every cigarette down to the filter. His skin had that yellow-gray tint of too much coffee and not enough sleep. He looked me up and down like he was measuring me for a coffin, then nodded.

“You’re the new guy?” he said, without turning fully around.

“Yeah,” I said. “Name’s Patrick.”

He nodded, sipped his coffee, and grunted. “Good luck.”

“Uh... thanks?”

He set the cup down and grabbed his keys from the desk, pocketing a beat-up flashlight that looked older than me.

“You’re replacing Carter,” he said. “The one who got fired. You hear about that?”

I shook my head.

He smirked like it wasn’t the first time he’d told it. “Guy before you threw a party down in the tunnels. Beer, girls, music, the whole damn circus. Then claimed he saw a ghost girl at the far end of C-hall and emptied his piece into the wall.”

I blinked.

“He shot at a ghost?”

“That’s what he told the bosses. Said she was floating. Dressed in white. His exact words were, ‘Her feet weren’t touching the floor.’”

He opened the door.

“Anyway, you’ll probably be fine,” he said, stepping into the dark. “Just don’t go looking for anything down there.”

Then the door closed behind him.

Miller didn’t say goodbye. He just left. His taillights disappeared down the long drive, and I was alone.

I stood there for a minute, not moving. Just listening. The guard station hummed with the quiet sounds of old wiring — the fluorescent buzz, the low whir of the vending machine compressor, the occasional soft *click* as the monitor switched camera feeds.

Outside, it was quieter. Too quiet, if I’m honest. No dogs barking, no traffic, not even wind. Just that kind of thick winter silence that makes your ears ring.

Then the space heater in the corner kicked on with a loud *clunk*, and I nearly jumped out of my skin.

Miller had left a checklist on the desk — handwritten in dark marker.

**1. Check every cottage.**  
**2. Sign the boiler log.**  
**3. Deliver newspapers to the admin building in the morning.**  
**4. NO PARTIES.**

That last line was underlined twice.

There were about six cottages total — arranged in two concentric circles around the asylum. I decided to start with the outer ring and work my way in.

So I bundled up, grabbed the ring of brass keys hanging from a bent nail near the door, and stepped out into the cold.

It was *freezing*.

The kind of cold that feels like it’s trying to saw through your jacket seams and get at the meat underneath. My breath came out in thick clouds, and the gravel crunched under my boots like broken glass.

The cottages were worse up close.

Each one had its own little cracked sidewalk leading up to a chipped cement stoop, most with storm doors that groaned when I pulled them open. Half the outer windows were busted out and boarded over. The interiors smelled like stale air and wet insulation — that distinct rot smell of a building that hasn’t been lived in for decades.

Inside, they were all more or less the same: single rooms with rusting metal bedframes, empty bookshelves, old particleboard desks with drawers that swelled shut from humidity. A few had posters peeling off the walls — Nixon-era safety charts, torn-up anatomy diagrams. One had a rosary nailed above the doorway like some long-forgotten charm to keep something out.

The boilers looked like something salvaged from a sunken ship — big, industrial beasts squatting in the corners of each utility room, all dented metal and riveted seams. Their fronts were covered in mesh grates, and the dials looked like something off a submarine. I checked to make sure the gage was still in the green zone like the laminated cheat sheet said, and waited for that faint rattle and hiss — the sound of gas waking up in the pipes.

Every time I stepped out of one cottage, I found myself hugging close to the next, never stepping too far into the open. Because right there in the middle of the circle — always visible, always looming — was that damn asylum building.

Even from a distance, it made my stomach knot.

By daylight it probably looked like a historical relic. But at night, that place looked *wrong*. Not haunted, exactly — just... hurt. Damaged. Like it had seen things it would never recover from. The upper floors were scorched black in places, like there’d been a fire at some point, and some of the windows had cracked in such a way that they looked like staring eyes. Or screaming mouths.

It wasn’t just old. It was *angry*. And the longer I looked at it, the more I felt like it was daring me to come closer.

So I didn’t.

I stuck to the cottages, one by one. Kept my flashlight low. Did the job. But I also snooped. Couldn’t help it.

There was a strange sameness to each one — like they’d been staged for a low-budget horror movie and no one ever came to shoot. But once in a while, I’d find something personal. A baby shoe, long since hardened with time. A hand mirror with a crack down the center, laid on the floor like someone dropped it mid-step. One had a stack of old magazines — *Good Housekeeping*, *Life*, and a copy of *TIME* from 1971 with the title “THE TROUBLED MIND” on the cover.

The weirdest was cottage #4. That one had a single dusty chair in the middle of the room — just a plain wooden kitchen chair, facing the far wall. Nothing else. No bed, no shelves, no heater. Just the chair. And on the wall it faced, someone had written a word in black marker, over and over again:

**NO.**  
**NO.**  
**NO.**  
**NO.**  
**NO.**

I didn’t linger in that one.

By the time I finished, the cold had crept through my boots and up my legs. My hands were stiff, even in gloves. I returned to the security office and sat there watching the monitors for hours, telling myself I hadn’t seen anything strange. Nothing moved. Nothing blinked. Just empty halls and static-filled corridors. That was it.

When the clock crawled past 6:30, I peeled myself out of the chair and grabbed the bundle of newspapers from beside the door — tightly wrapped in plastic, still a little damp from the cold. It was part of the job. Morning drop-off to the admin building. Simple enough.

The sky was getting lighter but hadn’t turned blue yet. Just that early-morning grey that makes everything look flat and empty. The wind had picked up while I was inside, and my jacket collar kept slapping the side of my face as I crossed the lot. The cottages stood silent around me, looking even more lifeless than they had overnight — like props waiting for someone to turn the lights back on.

The administration building sat across from the security office like it didn’t want to be associated with the rest. A two-story brick box with heavy doors and long windows that reflected nothing but overcast sky. One of the door handles was loose and made a metal-on-metal squeal when I pulled it open.

Inside, the heat blasted me like I’d walked into a laundromat mid-cycle. Stale and too dry. It smelled like scorched dust, burnt coffee, and something vaguely sweet I couldn’t place. The lights were all on — flickering fluorescents that made my eyes ache after a night of nothing but moonlight and black-and-white cameras.

I stepped into the hallway, unsure where to go with the papers. I hadn’t been given much of a tour. I figured I’d just drop one on every flat surface until someone told me I was doing it wrong.

That’s when I saw her.

She stepped out of one of the offices down the hall with a Styrofoam cup in one hand and a folder in the other. She wasn’t startled to see me — just mildly curious.

She looked to be late forties, maybe early fifties, with that kind of no-nonsense face that always looks slightly unimpressed but not unkind. Salt-and-pepper hair pulled back into a practical ponytail, and big square glasses on a thin chain that kept sliding down her nose. Her cardigan had a snag in the sleeve, and her shoes looked like they’d been picked for comfort over fashion about ten years ago.

“Newspapers?” she said, not quite smiling.

I held up the bundle. “First time. They didn’t tell me where these go.”

She took a sip from her coffee and nodded toward the hallway behind me. “Break room gets one. Copy room too. I take two — one here, one there.” Then she glanced at my uniform. “You’re the new overnight.”

“Yeah. Just started.”

She didn’t say “welcome.” She just gave a tiny nod, like that explained everything.

I dropped the papers where she pointed and was about to turn to leave when she added, “Watch your step near the stairwell at the end of the hall. Lock’s sticky.”

I nodded, not sure what to make of that — or her.

She watched me for a second longer than felt normal. Then, without another word, she disappeared back into her office, the sound of paper shuffling fading behind the door.

I didn’t hang around.

Once the papers were dropped off and the morning sky had shifted from gray to pale gold, I headed straight for the Nova. The sun made everything look flatter somehow. Less haunted, maybe. But no less depressing. The buildings — the cottages, the security office, the main facility — all sat there like they were waiting for something. And I didn’t want to be around when it showed up.",3,1760423598.0,nosleep,1,0.81,False

Hey Travel Trotters! 👋

We all know the feeling – temperatures drop, leaves change, and suddenly we're craving those perfectly cozy getaways. But forget Vermont and Maine for a minute – I've stumbled across some fascinating research that completely flips the script on where to find America's coziest vibes!

## The Cozy Cities You Never Expected

Would you believe JERSEY CITY tops the list of America's coziest cities? Or that MIAMI and HONOLULU – places we associate with beach parties and tropical drinks – are actually cozy havens? 

I was skeptical too until I dug into what actually makes a place ""cozy"" beyond just cold weather and fall foliage.

## What Makes a City Truly Cozy?

Real coziness isn't just about temperature – it's about experiences that warm your soul:

🌳 **Nature escapes within reach** – walkable parks where you can enjoy seasonal beauty
☕ **Comfort-focused spots** – think indie coffee shops, bookstores, tea houses, libraries 
🏡 **Hygge-friendly accommodations** – places where you can truly nest
🎨 **Creative activities** – workshops and classes that engage your artistic side during colder months

## America's Top 5 Cozy Destinations (That Will Surprise You)

## Planning Your Cozy City Escape

The best part about these unexpected cozy destinations? They're often more affordable during traditional ""off-seasons"" with fewer crowds!

Some tips for maximizing coziness:

1. **Book accommodations with character** – skip chain hotels for boutique spots or Airbnbs with fireplaces, reading nooks, etc.

2. **Research indoor activities ahead** – many workshops require advance registration

3. **Pack layers** – even Miami and Honolulu have cooler evenings perfect for that light sweater

4. **Seek out local recommendations** – residents know the coziest hidden gems that won't show up on TripAdvisor

5. **Create a coffee shop/bookstore crawl** – nothing says cozy like caffeinated literary wanderings

Chapter 49: Hannibal.

March 28, 2149, Earth Time.

Pursuit Time for Earth: 20 years and 12 days.

Perceived Pursuit Time for the Crew: 17.32 years.

Time to Braking Burn: 35 minutes.

The silence on the bridge of the Sparta-class super-heavy battleship, the Hannibal, was a substance. Thick and heavy, it settled on the shoulders like a leaden cloak and filled the lungs with every breath. It was broken only by the nervous tapping of officers' fingers on their consoles and the almost subliminal, vibrational hum of the powerful engines that had pushed this colossus through the void for over seventeen years. This was her home. Two hundred and sixty thousand tons of sovereign will, armor, and fusion reactors that hummed a familiar, almost lulling song of power.

Seventeen years. A whole generation on Earth. A time in which the children Rear Admiral Lena Kowalska had seen on screens had managed to grow up, fall in love, start families. A time in which her own memories of Berlin, of the smell of turpentine in Karina's studio and the touch of her hand, had become distant, almost unreal, like scenes from a movie watched in another life. This thought, like a nagging ghost, haunted her in the rare moments of silence—a needle of ice in a heart of titanium.

The air smelled of fear and cold, processed steel—the smell of home. Every pair of eyes was fixed on the main holoprojector, where the red icons of the Plague fleet, like drops of blood on black velvet, slowly grew, approaching the inevitable point of confrontation. She felt no fear. After what she had seen in Earth's orbit, after the massacre, fear was a luxury she could not afford. All that remained was cold, surgical precision and the weight of responsibility for eight hundred ships and a hundred thousand souls under her command. Each of those souls, visible as a green dot on her private display, was her personal commitment.

""Brief me on the plan and the system's characteristics one more time..."" Lena's voice was calm, but a steely hardness, forged in the fires of the battles for Earth and Proxima, lay hidden within it. She wanted to hear it again, not for the information, but to feel the rhythm of the coming operation, to make its logic her own.

""Yes, Rear Admiral,"" replied the first officer, Commander Singh, his face illuminated by the cool glow of the tactical screen. He was a veteran of the Battle of Proxima. His calm was an anchor for Lena. ""We will commence braking in 34 minutes. Our target is the Epsilon Eridani system.""

A visualization of the star and its planets appeared on the holoprojector. The orange light of the K2V-type dwarf flooded the bridge with an eerie glow.

Epsilon Eridani System Characteristics
Star Type: Orange dwarf (spectral type K2V). It is slightly cooler and less massive than the Sun, possessing about 0.8 of our star's mass.
Age: Estimated at just one billion years, making it a very young and magnetically active star. Numerous starspots and powerful flares pose a constant threat to unsecured electronics.
Asteroid Belts: The system has four dense asteroid belts, which constitute a natural minefield and potential cover for maneuvers.
Planets: Our long-range scans have confirmed the presence of four planets orbiting the star.
""The chosen braking point is the orbit of the system's outermost planet, but not in its physical shadow. It's an illogical move, but a necessary one to maintain a clear field of fire,"" the officer continued. ""The enemy is over six days ahead of us. They'll already be there. They're expecting us. But they're not expecting this.""

Operational Plan ""Spear of Time""
The plan was audacious in its simplicity and terrifying in its scale. They did not intend to engage in a direct fight with the remnants of K'tharr's fleet and the reinforcements built on-site—altogether about 1,200 Plague ships. Not at first. Their target was the planet—the source of their strength in this system.

""After braking, the Hannibal will immediately commence firing on the second planet, where, as we know from long-range sensors, their main industrial and shipbuilding complex is located.""

The officer pointed to a complex trajectory diagram.

""The Hannibal's main breakthrough cannon will fire with a massive lead. The power of the cannon and the kinetic energy of the plasma projectile beam will negate the scattering effect of the atmosphere, and the bombardment will be effective. According to calculations, before the Plague fleet realizes our maneuver and its objective, we will have fired 63 salvos. These projectiles will travel for the next three weeks toward the planet.""

Lena stared at the simulation. 63 fiery spears, each carrying enough energy to tear a battleship apart, gliding through the void in silence. This wasn't a tactic; it was the poetry of destruction. A soundless, cold, time-stretched annihilation that would force the enemy to watch helplessly as their doom approached.

""The only thing they'll be able to do is block their vector with their own hulls if they wish to save the planet,"" the officer added, a note of dark satisfaction in his voice. ""After firing the salvos, we will re-enter 0.5c and move to sector Delta. There, we will repeat the maneuver, firing another 46 salvos that will reach the target at the exact same time.""

The maneuver was to be repeated twice more from different positions, creating a synchronized shockwave of 178 plasma projectile beams that would strike the planet simultaneously from four different directions. It was a merciless tactic, born of cold, computer logic. A tactic worthy of the Ullaan, not humans. It forced the enemy to watch their impending death for weeks, giving them a choice between agony and suicide.

Lena nodded, feeling the chill of the command chair's armrest under her fingers. The plan was perfect. Brutal, inhuman, but logical. It forced the enemy to choose between two defeats: the loss of their base or a part of their fleet. And she, Lena Kowalska, and the ship Hannibal, were the executioner, just now raising the axe.

""Commander,"" her voice was quiet, but it carried an unquestionable authority. ""Connect me with the command of the transport group.""

The face of Commander Dubois, the commander of the transport flotilla, appeared on the screen. Her eyes, despite their weariness, burned with determination.

""Transport ships and their escort,"" Lena began, looking straight into the eyes of the woman on the screen. ""Change vector and brake at the designated point outside the system. Upon arrival, shut down all non-essential systems and go dark. Await orders under radio silence.""

Dubois was silent for a second, processing the command. This was a one-way ticket. Her people were becoming ghosts, drifting in the void, waiting for a signal that might never come.

""And if..."" she began.

""If we win, you will receive further orders within four weeks,"" Lena finished for her, her voice not wavering for a moment. ""If we lose... if you do not receive a signal, you return to the solar system alone. Understood? That is an order, Commander Dubois. There is no room for sentiment.""

There was no fear on Dubois's face. Only the determination of a veteran. She knew that Lena had just entrusted her with the last mission in case her plan failed: to save the people.

""Yes, Rear Admiral. Good luck. And may the gods watch over you.""

The connection was cut. Lena turned to her crew. Their faces were focused, ready.

""Time to braking: ten minutes. All systems to battle stations. Helmets on and sealed. Let history remember this day. Let's show them how wolves hunt.""

The bridge of the Plague flagship, the Inevitable End, was a temple of cold, brutalist functionality. The air held the metallic scent of recycled oxygen and the barely perceptible smell of dust from systems that had been running at full capacity for decades. K'tharr, a powerful reptile with armor scarred by hundreds of battles, stood as still as a statue, staring at the data from the long-range sensors. His heavy tail beat a steady rhythm against the metal deck—the only sign of his internal tension.

""They're going to brake in orbit, on the side of the fourth planet visible to us. Why in the hells there?"" he snarled, his voice like the grinding of stones.

The standard, logical, only sensible maneuver was to choose the gravitational and physical shadow of a planet to hide behind, to mask one's thermal and energy signature, to prepare for a surprise attack. This move was illogical. It was either arrogant or suicidal. And humans, as the painful lesson from Earth's orbit had taught him, were not suicidal.

""Commander K'tharr... Perhaps they will fire immediately?"" a timid voice spoke from the side.

K'tharr looked at the young cadet, R'thak. Freshly printed, his scales shone with newness, and a naive zeal burned in his eyes. This was to be his first battle. K'tharr usually ignored such remarks, but something in the absurdity of the suggestion made him pause.

""Impossible, cadet,"" he replied with the condescension of a mentor chiding a student. ""The distance is too great. Our simulations are clear. Railgun projectiles have too low a velocity. They would travel for months. And plasma beams..."" he hesitated for a moment. ""Plasma projectiles have a much higher velocity, up to 10% of light speed, but their energy signature is visible to sensors from such a distance like a nuclear explosion. We would have more than enough time for evasive maneuv... ers...""

He broke off mid-word. A sudden chill, colder than the vacuum of space, ran down his reptilian spine. He looked at the cadet with a new, predatory interest.

Unless they're shooting at something that can't dodge.

With a single gesture of his clawed hand, he switched the main holoprojector to a detailed view of the system's second planet—their base.

""But plasma cannons are ineffective for bombarding planets with dense atmospheres. It disperses the plasma. That's basic knowledge!"" he said to himself, but his certainty was already cracking. ""Unless...""

He swore by the Emperor. He remembered the sight from the Battle of Earth. He remembered the chaotic data about a super-heavy battleship and its powerful, central plasma cannon. He remembered the crater on the Moon. A weapon so powerful that even after the beam was weakened by the atmosphere, its impact would still be effective. It wouldn't destroy the planet, but with the precision of divine wrath, it would burn their shipyards from its surface.

""We need to birth new, fresh minds that think outside the box,"" K'tharr turned to R'thak, and a grimace that could pass for a smile full of admiration appeared on his maw. ""Well done, cadet, you've just secured yourself a permanent assignment on my crew! Continue your analysis. And pray to the emperor that our current incarnations survive this battle!""

He looked at the current status of his fleet. He had a total of 1,434 ships at his disposal. It was a force capable of crushing anyone. The generals and advisors whom the Emperor had sent to the front in a rage had performed well. The fear of final death—the erasure of one's consciousness copy—had proven to be an excellent motivator. They had accelerated ship construction and strengthened their defenses. K'tharr felt the fury give way to a cold, predatory confidence.

It won't be as easy with us as it was with our brothers at Proxima, he thought. We know what to expect.

""Commander, new braking vectors! There are many of them!""

""How many?""

""Twenty-three!""

""Not only are they attacking with smaller forces, but they're also splitting their fleet into 23 smaller groups? Simulate the destination of all vectors!""

""The first one remains the same; they'll have a clear view when targeting the planet. The rest will brake at various points in the largest asteroid belt.""

K'tharr froze. This wasn't a simple attack. It was something far worse. A complex, multi-vector operation. One group was meant to protect the super-heavy battleship as it bombarded the planet, while the rest, hidden in the asteroid belts with their systems off, could strike suddenly from any direction.

""We have a tactical genius on our hands,"" K'tharr muttered, and to the astonishment of his officers, his voice held a note of near-admiration. ""To fight and lose against him would be no stain on one's honor. But I do not intend to lose!""

I am a hunter. This thought was the only constant in Al-Farsi's existence. It was not a metaphor. After years spent in a sarcophagus of nutrient gel, connected by a neural interface to every system of the ""Crow 3.0,"" the line between body and machine had blurred, becoming a meaningless, academic distinction. His senses were passive gravimetric sensors, his nerves were fiber optics pulsing with data.

Silence. In the asteroid belt, the silence was absolute, physical. It absorbed every photon, suppressed every radio wave. Axel and his wingmen drifted in this nothingness like ghosts. Eleven carriers, including his own ""Attila,"" had released their swarms, hundreds of ""Crows,"" which now, like a pack of spectral piranhas, lurked in the quarry of space. Each pilot was a solitary island, connected to the others only by an invisible, tactical network. Their task was to support the hidden fleet—the battleships, cruisers, and destroyers that had frozen motionless on the surfaces of the largest chunks of ice and rock, their reactors running on the verge of shutdown.

Monotony. That was the real torture. Worse than the pain of phantom limbs. The waiting. Axel patrolled his designated sector—a cubic fragment of vacuum with an edge of a thousand kilometers. Back and forth. Back and forth, drifting. Each pass was identical: a short burst from a maneuvering thruster, then hours of coasting. He knew every asteroid by heart, every magnetic anomaly, every shadow. They were his neighbors in this cemetery.

In his consciousness, against the backdrop of constant tactical data analysis, music throbbed. Joan Jett. ""An' I don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation!"" A memory the simulation system replayed with manic persistence, an echo of his last request. It was his private act of rebellion, the only thing that wasn't an order, that was his alone.

On the tactical display of his helmet, which was now his only window to the world, the icons of his wingmen flickered. Ghosts. He couldn't see their faces, couldn't hear their voices. Only status confirmations. Green, pulsing points of life in the infinite black.

He was waiting for the order. For the signal that would turn this monotonous watch into a dance of death. He was waiting for the hunt. He was a weapon, and a weapon without a purpose rusts. And he could feel that rust in every circuit, in every fold of his digital conscience.

On the bridge of the Hannibal, there was a different kind of silence. It was not the clean, sterile silence of the void. It was a deep-sea silence, heavy with pressure and unspoken tension. For five days, the ship, along with its entire escort group, had been suspended in the upper, dense layers of a gas giant's atmosphere. It was an ocean of hydrogen and methane, and they were its submarine, submerged at a depth where the atmosphere began to behave more like water than gas.

The hull groaned. Lena heard it constantly—low, vibrational rumbles, cracks, and whimpers of metal fighting against the pressure of dozens of atmospheres. The constant creaking and groaning of the hull kept the crew in a state of perpetual stress. Every sound was like a claw scraping at her nerves. The pervasive smell of sweat and burnt fear mingled with the metallic aftertaste of coffee from the dispenser. Life support was running at a minimum, and the temperature was steadily rising.

The fifth day. The fifth day in the twilight of the red emergency lighting that had become their only sun. The fifth day of listening. All active systems were shut down. They were blind and deaf, relying only on passive sensors that struggled to penetrate the dense, perpetually churning clouds of the planet.

""Report on hull status,"" her voice was quiet, but it cut through the hum of the ventilation like a blade.

""Structural integrity at ninety-two percent, Admiral,"" Commander Singh replied, not taking his eyes off his monitor. ""Stresses on the main frames are within tolerance. We won't last more than another two weeks in these conditions.""

Lena nodded. She knew. They were in a trap they had set for themselves.

The salvos from the main breakthrough cannon had been a success, but only a partial one. They had fired ninety-six shots before the Plague realized their intentions and forced them to flee. Now, those ninety-six spears of fire were hurtling toward the planet, but the enemy had weeks to prepare, to react. And they were stuck here, waiting for that reaction.

The memory of Karina, her laugh and the smell of turpentine, was like an echo from another world. A world where there was sun, wind, and touch. Here, there was only metal, pressure, and waiting.

She looked at the crew. Faces focused, pale in the red light. She saw two young ensigns in the corner of the bridge playing cards on a datapad, wordlessly, their movements slow and mechanical. She saw the thousand-yard stares of veterans who had already lived through too many such moments of silence. A drop of sweat trickled down the back of one officer, bent over his console, before detaching and falling in the gas giant's gravity. They were in the atmosphere at an altitude from the core where the gravity was 1.31 G. From the ceiling, at regular, maddening intervals, condensed moisture dripped. A sign that life support was running on its minimum setting. Drip... drip... drip... Each drop hit the metal deck with a sound as loud as a cannon shot.

They were waiting for the enemy's move. For a sign that their gambit had succeeded, or that they had just signed their own death warrant. Five days in the breath of a giant. Five days on the edge of madness.

Suddenly, one of the listening officers flinched. He lifted his head from his console, his eyes widening in a silent scream.

""Rear Admiral..."" his voice was a strangled whisper. ""We have it. Multiple, synchronized energy signatures. They're coming from behind the planet. They're heading our way.""

Lena felt a knot of ice form in her stomach.

It had begun.

2 days earlier.

Bridge of the Plague flagship, the Inevitable End.

On the main holoprojector, the icons of ninety-six plasma salvos moved like the beads of a fiery rosary. Each point was a death sentence, set to fall upon their base in three weeks. Upon their shipyards. Upon the pride of their empire.

And the ship that had fired them, along with its escort, had vanished. It had dissolved into the thick atmosphere of a gas giant, leaving behind only a contemptuous silence and the echo of its brazen audacity.

""A tactical genius. He's hidden his most powerful weapon in a place we can't reach it, and scattered the rest of his fleet, like a pack of wolves, in the asteroid belt. They're waiting.""

They were waiting for his fleet to give chase to the Hannibal, straight into the jaws of an ambush. They were waiting for him to try to defend the planet, exposing himself to crossfire from hundreds of hidden destroyers and cruisers. Every move was a trap. Every decision led to slaughter.

But the worst part was the inaction. Waiting for three weeks for an execution, for a rain of fire that would turn the work of the empire to dust, was an unacceptable option. It was a dishonor that a warrior of his stature could not afford.

""We will not give them that satisfaction,"" he muttered to G'tharr, his tactical officer, who stood beside him, pale and tense. ""We will not stand by and watch our shipyards burn. We must provoke them. Force them out of hiding. Now.""

His mind, hardened in hundreds of battles, worked with the speed of a combat computer. He couldn't attack the gas giant—that would be suicide. But he could hunt the wolves hiding in the quarry. He had to force them to fight on his terms.

""Order for the entire fleet!"" his roar echoed off the metal walls of the bridge, shattering the tense silence. ""Hunter-killer groups! Form 10 hunter-killer groups! Each composed of five destroyers and ten frigates. Your target: the asteroid belts. You are to sweep every sector. Every shadow. Every piece of ice and rock. Send out two drone motherships; they are to begin patrolling the asteroid belt! After releasing their drones, the ships are to return to the main fleet immediately.""

New vectors appeared on the holoprojector. Dozens of small, aggressive arrows that clawed their way into the chaotic labyrinth of the asteroid belt.

""Your mission: seek and destroy,"" K'tharr continued, a cold, predatory fire igniting in his reptilian eyes. ""You are to flush them out. I don't expect you to destroy them all. I expect you to force them to fight. To make them bleed before the Hannibal's plasma beams reach us.""

He looked at G'tharr, and a cruel grimace appeared on his maw. ""Humans are sentimental, G'tharr. Goth'roh taught us that. They won't stand by and watch us pick off their pack, one by one. Eventually, they will break. They will come out of hiding to save their own. And then... then we will be waiting for them.""

He issued a second order, just as precise and merciless.

""Form a battle group. 20 cruisers, 10 battleships, and 70 frigates. Establish a cordon around the fourth planet. Maximum sensor range. Your task is not to attack. You are to be the eyes. You are to watch. If the Hannibal or any other human ship pokes its head out of that damned gas soup for even a second, you are to lock onto it, engage it, and hold it until reinforcements arrive.""

The plan was simple in its brutality. Provocation. He was releasing the hounds to harry and force the wolves out of the forest, while he, the master hunter, waited with the rest of the fleet, ready to deliver the killing blow. He was risking the loss of some of his forces, but he was gaining something far more valuable—time and initiative.

""Begin the operation!"" he roared.

From the massive hulls of the motherships, smaller, agile drones began to emerge like swarms of enraged wasps. They formed into groups and, with silent fury, threw themselves toward the asteroid belt. The hunt had begun.

K'tharr stood on the bridge, watching his hounds disappear into the darkness. He felt the eyes of the entire crew on him. He knew he had bet everything on a single card—on the psychology of an enemy he was only just beginning to understand. On their impulsiveness, on their honor, on their damned, human need to save their own.

And in the background, on the main screen, the icons of the ninety-six plasma salvos continued their inexorable advance toward their planet and base. The countdown to execution was on. Now, it was a race. A race to see what would come first: the humans' mistake, or the impact of the Spear of Time.

Chapter 49: Hannibal.

March 28, 2149, Earth Time.

Pursuit Time for Earth: 20 years and 12 days.

Perceived Pursuit Time for the Crew: 17.32 years.

Time to Braking Burn: 35 minutes.

The silence on the bridge of the Sparta-class super-heavy battleship, the Hannibal, was a substance. Thick and heavy, it settled on the shoulders like a leaden cloak and filled the lungs with every breath. It was broken only by the nervous tapping of officers' fingers on their consoles and the almost subliminal, vibrational hum of the powerful engines that had pushed this colossus through the void for over seventeen years. This was her home. Two hundred and sixty thousand tons of sovereign will, armor, and fusion reactors that hummed a familiar, almost lulling song of power.

Seventeen years. A whole generation on Earth. A time in which the children Rear Admiral Lena Kowalska had seen on screens had managed to grow up, fall in love, start families. A time in which her own memories of Berlin, of the smell of turpentine in Karina's studio and the touch of her hand, had become distant, almost unreal, like scenes from a movie watched in another life. This thought, like a nagging ghost, haunted her in the rare moments of silence—a needle of ice in a heart of titanium.

The air smelled of fear and cold, processed steel—the smell of home. Every pair of eyes was fixed on the main holoprojector, where the red icons of the Plague fleet, like drops of blood on black velvet, slowly grew, approaching the inevitable point of confrontation. She felt no fear. After what she had seen in Earth's orbit, after the massacre, fear was a luxury she could not afford. All that remained was cold, surgical precision and the weight of responsibility for eight hundred ships and a hundred thousand souls under her command. Each of those souls, visible as a green dot on her private display, was her personal commitment.

""Brief me on the plan and the system's characteristics one more time..."" Lena's voice was calm, but a steely hardness, forged in the fires of the battles for Earth and Proxima, lay hidden within it. She wanted to hear it again, not for the information, but to feel the rhythm of the coming operation, to make its logic her own.

""Yes, Rear Admiral,"" replied the first officer, Commander Singh, his face illuminated by the cool glow of the tactical screen. He was a veteran of the Battle of Proxima. His calm was an anchor for Lena. ""We will commence braking in 34 minutes. Our target is the Epsilon Eridani system.""

A visualization of the star and its planets appeared on the holoprojector. The orange light of the K2V-type dwarf flooded the bridge with an eerie glow.

Epsilon Eridani System Characteristics
Star Type: Orange dwarf (spectral type K2V). It is slightly cooler and less massive than the Sun, possessing about 0.8 of our star's mass.
Age: Estimated at just one billion years, making it a very young and magnetically active star. Numerous starspots and powerful flares pose a constant threat to unsecured electronics.
Asteroid Belts: The system has four dense asteroid belts, which constitute a natural minefield and potential cover for maneuvers.
Planets: Our long-range scans have confirmed the presence of four planets orbiting the star.
""The chosen braking point is the orbit of the system's outermost planet, but not in its physical shadow. It's an illogical move, but a necessary one to maintain a clear field of fire,"" the officer continued. ""The enemy is over six days ahead of us. They'll already be there. They're expecting us. But they're not expecting this.""

Operational Plan ""Spear of Time""
The plan was audacious in its simplicity and terrifying in its scale. They did not intend to engage in a direct fight with the remnants of K'tharr's fleet and the reinforcements built on-site—altogether about 1,200 Plague ships. Not at first. Their target was the planet—the source of their strength in this system.

""After braking, the Hannibal will immediately commence firing on the second planet, where, as we know from long-range sensors, their main industrial and shipbuilding complex is located.""

The officer pointed to a complex trajectory diagram.

""The Hannibal's main breakthrough cannon will fire with a massive lead. The power of the cannon and the kinetic energy of the plasma projectile beam will negate the scattering effect of the atmosphere, and the bombardment will be effective. According to calculations, before the Plague fleet realizes our maneuver and its objective, we will have fired 63 salvos. These projectiles will travel for the next three weeks toward the planet.""

Lena stared at the simulation. 63 fiery spears, each carrying enough energy to tear a battleship apart, gliding through the void in silence. This wasn't a tactic; it was the poetry of destruction. A soundless, cold, time-stretched annihilation that would force the enemy to watch helplessly as their doom approached.

""The only thing they'll be able to do is block their vector with their own hulls if they wish to save the planet,"" the officer added, a note of dark satisfaction in his voice. ""After firing the salvos, we will re-enter 0.5c and move to sector Delta. There, we will repeat the maneuver, firing another 46 salvos that will reach the target at the exact same time.""

The maneuver was to be repeated twice more from different positions, creating a synchronized shockwave of 178 plasma projectile beams that would strike the planet simultaneously from four different directions. It was a merciless tactic, born of cold, computer logic. A tactic worthy of the Ullaan, not humans. It forced the enemy to watch their impending death for weeks, giving them a choice between agony and suicide.

Lena nodded, feeling the chill of the command chair's armrest under her fingers. The plan was perfect. Brutal, inhuman, but logical. It forced the enemy to choose between two defeats: the loss of their base or a part of their fleet. And she, Lena Kowalska, and the ship Hannibal, were the executioner, just now raising the axe.

""Commander,"" her voice was quiet, but it carried an unquestionable authority. ""Connect me with the command of the transport group.""

The face of Commander Dubois, the commander of the transport flotilla, appeared on the screen. Her eyes, despite their weariness, burned with determination.

""Transport ships and their escort,"" Lena began, looking straight into the eyes of the woman on the screen. ""Change vector and brake at the designated point outside the system. Upon arrival, shut down all non-essential systems and go dark. Await orders under radio silence.""

Dubois was silent for a second, processing the command. This was a one-way ticket. Her people were becoming ghosts, drifting in the void, waiting for a signal that might never come.

""And if..."" she began.

""If we win, you will receive further orders within four weeks,"" Lena finished for her, her voice not wavering for a moment. ""If we lose... if you do not receive a signal, you return to the solar system alone. Understood? That is an order, Commander Dubois. There is no room for sentiment.""

There was no fear on Dubois's face. Only the determination of a veteran. She knew that Lena had just entrusted her with the last mission in case her plan failed: to save the people.

""Yes, Rear Admiral. Good luck. And may the gods watch over you.""

The connection was cut. Lena turned to her crew. Their faces were focused, ready.

""Time to braking: ten minutes. All systems to battle stations. Helmets on and sealed. Let history remember this day. Let's show them how wolves hunt.""

The bridge of the Plague flagship, the Inevitable End, was a temple of cold, brutalist functionality. The air held the metallic scent of recycled oxygen and the barely perceptible smell of dust from systems that had been running at full capacity for decades. K'tharr, a powerful reptile with armor scarred by hundreds of battles, stood as still as a statue, staring at the data from the long-range sensors. His heavy tail beat a steady rhythm against the metal deck—the only sign of his internal tension.

""They're going to brake in orbit, on the side of the fourth planet visible to us. Why in the hells there?"" he snarled, his voice like the grinding of stones.

The standard, logical, only sensible maneuver was to choose the gravitational and physical shadow of a planet to hide behind, to mask one's thermal and energy signature, to prepare for a surprise attack. This move was illogical. It was either arrogant or suicidal. And humans, as the painful lesson from Earth's orbit had taught him, were not suicidal.

""Commander K'tharr... Perhaps they will fire immediately?"" a timid voice spoke from the side.

K'tharr looked at the young cadet, R'thak. Freshly printed, his scales shone with newness, and a naive zeal burned in his eyes. This was to be his first battle. K'tharr usually ignored such remarks, but something in the absurdity of the suggestion made him pause.

""Impossible, cadet,"" he replied with the condescension of a mentor chiding a student. ""The distance is too great. Our simulations are clear. Railgun projectiles have too low a velocity. They would travel for months. And plasma beams..."" he hesitated for a moment. ""Plasma projectiles have a much higher velocity, up to 10% of light speed, but their energy signature is visible to sensors from such a distance like a nuclear explosion. We would have more than enough time for evasive maneuv... ers...""

He broke off mid-word. A sudden chill, colder than the vacuum of space, ran down his reptilian spine. He looked at the cadet with a new, predatory interest.

Unless they're shooting at something that can't dodge.

With a single gesture of his clawed hand, he switched the main holoprojector to a detailed view of the system's second planet—their base.

""But plasma cannons are ineffective for bombarding planets with dense atmospheres. It disperses the plasma. That's basic knowledge!"" he said to himself, but his certainty was already cracking. ""Unless...""

He swore by the Emperor. He remembered the sight from the Battle of Earth. He remembered the chaotic data about a super-heavy battleship and its powerful, central plasma cannon. He remembered the crater on the Moon. A weapon so powerful that even after the beam was weakened by the atmosphere, its impact would still be effective. It wouldn't destroy the planet, but with the precision of divine wrath, it would burn their shipyards from its surface.

""We need to birth new, fresh minds that think outside the box,"" K'tharr turned to R'thak, and a grimace that could pass for a smile full of admiration appeared on his maw. ""Well done, cadet, you've just secured yourself a permanent assignment on my crew! Continue your analysis. And pray to the emperor that our current incarnations survive this battle!""

He looked at the current status of his fleet. He had a total of 1,434 ships at his disposal. It was a force capable of crushing anyone. The generals and advisors whom the Emperor had sent to the front in a rage had performed well. The fear of final death—the erasure of one's consciousness copy—had proven to be an excellent motivator. They had accelerated ship construction and strengthened their defenses. K'tharr felt the fury give way to a cold, predatory confidence.

It won't be as easy with us as it was with our brothers at Proxima, he thought. We know what to expect.

""Commander, new braking vectors! There are many of them!""

""How many?""

""Twenty-three!""

""Not only are they attacking with smaller forces, but they're also splitting their fleet into 23 smaller groups? Simulate the destination of all vectors!""

""The first one remains the same; they'll have a clear view when targeting the planet. The rest will brake at various points in the largest asteroid belt.""

K'tharr froze. This wasn't a simple attack. It was something far worse. A complex, multi-vector operation. One group was meant to protect the super-heavy battleship as it bombarded the planet, while the rest, hidden in the asteroid belts with their systems off, could strike suddenly from any direction.

""We have a tactical genius on our hands,"" K'tharr muttered, and to the astonishment of his officers, his voice held a note of near-admiration. ""To fight and lose against him would be no stain on one's honor. But I do not intend to lose!""

I am a hunter. This thought was the only constant in Al-Farsi's existence. It was not a metaphor. After years spent in a sarcophagus of nutrient gel, connected by a neural interface to every system of the ""Crow 3.0,"" the line between body and machine had blurred, becoming a meaningless, academic distinction. His senses were passive gravimetric sensors, his nerves were fiber optics pulsing with data.

Silence. In the asteroid belt, the silence was absolute, physical. It absorbed every photon, suppressed every radio wave. Axel and his wingmen drifted in this nothingness like ghosts. Eleven carriers, including his own ""Attila,"" had released their swarms, hundreds of ""Crows,"" which now, like a pack of spectral piranhas, lurked in the quarry of space. Each pilot was a solitary island, connected to the others only by an invisible, tactical network. Their task was to support the hidden fleet—the battleships, cruisers, and destroyers that had frozen motionless on the surfaces of the largest chunks of ice and rock, their reactors running on the verge of shutdown.

Monotony. That was the real torture. Worse than the pain of phantom limbs. The waiting. Axel patrolled his designated sector—a cubic fragment of vacuum with an edge of a thousand kilometers. Back and forth. Back and forth, drifting. Each pass was identical: a short burst from a maneuvering thruster, then hours of coasting. He knew every asteroid by heart, every magnetic anomaly, every shadow. They were his neighbors in this cemetery.

In his consciousness, against the backdrop of constant tactical data analysis, music throbbed. Joan Jett. ""An' I don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation!"" A memory the simulation system replayed with manic persistence, an echo of his last request. It was his private act of rebellion, the only thing that wasn't an order, that was his alone.

On the tactical display of his helmet, which was now his only window to the world, the icons of his wingmen flickered. Ghosts. He couldn't see their faces, couldn't hear their voices. Only status confirmations. Green, pulsing points of life in the infinite black.

He was waiting for the order. For the signal that would turn this monotonous watch into a dance of death. He was waiting for the hunt. He was a weapon, and a weapon without a purpose rusts. And he could feel that rust in every circuit, in every fold of his digital conscience.

On the bridge of the Hannibal, there was a different kind of silence. It was not the clean, sterile silence of the void. It was a deep-sea silence, heavy with pressure and unspoken tension. For five days, the ship, along with its entire escort group, had been suspended in the upper, dense layers of a gas giant's atmosphere. It was an ocean of hydrogen and methane, and they were its submarine, submerged at a depth where the atmosphere began to behave more like water than gas.

The hull groaned. Lena heard it constantly—low, vibrational rumbles, cracks, and whimpers of metal fighting against the pressure of dozens of atmospheres. The constant creaking and groaning of the hull kept the crew in a state of perpetual stress. Every sound was like a claw scraping at her nerves. The pervasive smell of sweat and burnt fear mingled with the metallic aftertaste of coffee from the dispenser. Life support was running at a minimum, and the temperature was steadily rising.

The fifth day. The fifth day in the twilight of the red emergency lighting that had become their only sun. The fifth day of listening. All active systems were shut down. They were blind and deaf, relying only on passive sensors that struggled to penetrate the dense, perpetually churning clouds of the planet.

""Report on hull status,"" her voice was quiet, but it cut through the hum of the ventilation like a blade.

""Structural integrity at ninety-two percent, Admiral,"" Commander Singh replied, not taking his eyes off his monitor. ""Stresses on the main frames are within tolerance. We won't last more than another two weeks in these conditions.""

Lena nodded. She knew. They were in a trap they had set for themselves.

The salvos from the main breakthrough cannon had been a success, but only a partial one. They had fired ninety-six shots before the Plague realized their intentions and forced them to flee. Now, those ninety-six spears of fire were hurtling toward the planet, but the enemy had weeks to prepare, to react. And they were stuck here, waiting for that reaction.

The memory of Karina, her laugh and the smell of turpentine, was like an echo from another world. A world where there was sun, wind, and touch. Here, there was only metal, pressure, and waiting.

She looked at the crew. Faces focused, pale in the red light. She saw two young ensigns in the corner of the bridge playing cards on a datapad, wordlessly, their movements slow and mechanical. She saw the thousand-yard stares of veterans who had already lived through too many such moments of silence. A drop of sweat trickled down the back of one officer, bent over his console, before detaching and falling in the gas giant's gravity. They were in the atmosphere at an altitude from the core where the gravity was 1.31 G. From the ceiling, at regular, maddening intervals, condensed moisture dripped. A sign that life support was running on its minimum setting. Drip... drip... drip... Each drop hit the metal deck with a sound as loud as a cannon shot.

They were waiting for the enemy's move. For a sign that their gambit had succeeded, or that they had just signed their own death warrant. Five days in the breath of a giant. Five days on the edge of madness.

Suddenly, one of the listening officers flinched. He lifted his head from his console, his eyes widening in a silent scream.

""Rear Admiral..."" his voice was a strangled whisper. ""We have it. Multiple, synchronized energy signatures. They're coming from behind the planet. They're heading our way.""

Lena felt a knot of ice form in her stomach.

It had begun.

2 days earlier.

Bridge of the Plague flagship, the Inevitable End.

On the main holoprojector, the icons of ninety-six plasma salvos moved like the beads of a fiery rosary. Each point was a death sentence, set to fall upon their base in three weeks. Upon their shipyards. Upon the pride of their empire.

And the ship that had fired them, along with its escort, had vanished. It had dissolved into the thick atmosphere of a gas giant, leaving behind only a contemptuous silence and the echo of its brazen audacity.

""A tactical genius. He's hidden his most powerful weapon in a place we can't reach it, and scattered the rest of his fleet, like a pack of wolves, in the asteroid belt. They're waiting.""

They were waiting for his fleet to give chase to the Hannibal, straight into the jaws of an ambush. They were waiting for him to try to defend the planet, exposing himself to crossfire from hundreds of hidden destroyers and cruisers. Every move was a trap. Every decision led to slaughter.

But the worst part was the inaction. Waiting for three weeks for an execution, for a rain of fire that would turn the work of the empire to dust, was an unacceptable option. It was a dishonor that a warrior of his stature could not afford.

""We will not give them that satisfaction,"" he muttered to G'tharr, his tactical officer, who stood beside him, pale and tense. ""We will not stand by and watch our shipyards burn. We must provoke them. Force them out of hiding. Now.""

His mind, hardened in hundreds of battles, worked with the speed of a combat computer. He couldn't attack the gas giant—that would be suicide. But he could hunt the wolves hiding in the quarry. He had to force them to fight on his terms.

""Order for the entire fleet!"" his roar echoed off the metal walls of the bridge, shattering the tense silence. ""Hunter-killer groups! Form 10 hunter-killer groups! Each composed of five destroyers and ten frigates. Your target: the asteroid belts. You are to sweep every sector. Every shadow. Every piece of ice and rock. Send out two drone motherships; they are to begin patrolling the asteroid belt! After releasing their drones, the ships are to return to the main fleet immediately.""

New vectors appeared on the holoprojector. Dozens of small, aggressive arrows that clawed their way into the chaotic labyrinth of the asteroid belt.

""Your mission: seek and destroy,"" K'tharr continued, a cold, predatory fire igniting in his reptilian eyes. ""You are to flush them out. I don't expect you to destroy them all. I expect you to force them to fight. To make them bleed before the Hannibal's plasma beams reach us.""

He looked at G'tharr, and a cruel grimace appeared on his maw. ""Humans are sentimental, G'tharr. Goth'roh taught us that. They won't stand by and watch us pick off their pack, one by one. Eventually, they will break. They will come out of hiding to save their own. And then... then we will be waiting for them.""

He issued a second order, just as precise and merciless.

""Form a battle group. 20 cruisers, 10 battleships, and 70 frigates. Establish a cordon around the fourth planet. Maximum sensor range. Your task is not to attack. You are to be the eyes. You are to watch. If the Hannibal or any other human ship pokes its head out of that damned gas soup for even a second, you are to lock onto it, engage it, and hold it until reinforcements arrive.""

The plan was simple in its brutality. Provocation. He was releasing the hounds to harry and force the wolves out of the forest, while he, the master hunter, waited with the rest of the fleet, ready to deliver the killing blow. He was risking the loss of some of his forces, but he was gaining something far more valuable—time and initiative.

""Begin the operation!"" he roared.

From the massive hulls of the motherships, smaller, agile drones began to emerge like swarms of enraged wasps. They formed into groups and, with silent fury, threw themselves toward the asteroid belt. The hunt had begun.

K'tharr stood on the bridge, watching his hounds disappear into the darkness. He felt the eyes of the entire crew on him. He knew he had bet everything on a single card—on the psychology of an enemy he was only just beginning to understand. On their impulsiveness, on their honor, on their damned, human need to save their own.

And in the background, on the main screen, the icons of the ninety-six plasma salvos continued their inexorable advance toward their planet and base. The countdown to execution was on. Now, it was a race. A race to see what would come first: the humans' mistake, or the impact of the Spear of Time.

For starters there is a 50 yr old family friend who lives here, and she sleeps with her door wide open, not a big deal but she tends to wake up around 2-3am every night and instead of closing her door she leaves it wide open and turns on her bright ass light. This would be ok if we had a proper door on our room but instead we have a frosted glass door and I have a 1 yr old, the light goes straight through into his crib and it bothers me so much. Next thing is I had bought myself a salad at Maverick and left it in the fridge overnight, I woke up this morning and as I’m grabbing it my bfs younger sister says “oh you’re lucky you got that, I was getting ready to eat it.” Ummmm just principle if what’s in the fridge isn’t yours you don’t touch right? Well I thought I was in the clear I ate about half, fully mixed it, added my dressing ate half and left the rest in the fridge before my shift at work assuming if somebody saw a half eaten salad all mixed and eaten out of they wouldn’t go for it…. Welp I was wrong again, because I came home from my shift and my salad was gone, I opened the trash and there it is all picked through half of the toppings thrown away as if whoever ate it just wanted lettuce with ranch, ate that and then threw away the rest. I can’t be the only one who thinks this is despicable. I recently bought myself 2 Starbucks coffees in the glass bottles from the grocery store and had to basically hide them away, and was told by my bfs sister if she knows I have poppi sodas she absolutely would come into our room uninvited or while nobody is here and take them. I just feel so violated because I never EVER take other people’s things before asking or just assume something is fair game or for me when untouched for an hour like are we joking I just think the whole thing is irritating and we’ve only been here 2 weeks!!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

**By** [**Frankie**](https://web.archive.org/web/20090204062435/http://www.bungie.net/Account/Profile.aspx?uid=6565)  
Monday, January 19th, 2004, 6:22 PM

Lorraine McLees gives us the inside skinny on creating art for the Halo universe, as **Sketch** chats with Bungie's resident Artist about the process involved in creating the Halo 2 cover for The Official Xbox Magazine.

**Sketch** : Have you worked on any magazine covers in the past? If so, what were they?

**Lorraine:** The last thing I worked on that made it to magazine covers was [Oni ](https://web.archive.org/web/20090204062435/http://www.bungie.net/News/%20http://oni.godgames.com/%20).I think the most notable one was an issue of Gamers Republic. There were a couple of others, in the US and the UK, but I can't remember them off the top of my head.



**Sketch** : How does creating a magazine cover differ from say, creating an ad or a box cover?

**Lorraine:** Not much different, really. It depends on whether or not I'm doing the entire box (front, back, flaps if any) or just the cover. In general, ads tend to be horizontal for a two-page spread but composed so it would be easy to crop for a single-page ad and still have room for logos, screenshots and text. Box covers are generally vertical. Of the three, box covers often have the most time allotted to them (unless I'm called on to fix one!)

I'm not sure how it works elsewhere, but in the case of the ad for *Halo* for the PC (which was later appropriated for the Mac version), the consensus was to show some giant epic battle on a recognizable map where the ring structure that is Halo would be visible. The going message was Halo invades the PC. The image in my head was pretty clear and after discussing with Andrew, the product manager for Halo for the PC and Pete, Bungies studio manager and former head of Xbox Marketing, the execution of this message was pretty much left up to me. Oh, and I was told I only had a few days, but they trusted Id be able to come up with something really cool. Sure. No sweat.

So I played the game, froze a scene, moved the camera, took a screenshot, rinsed, repeat. I did that until I got all the pieces to something close to what I wanted. Assembling the humongous file, I presented the visualization of my concept to Pete and Andrew, who said wow, so I said cool, then we all said variations of, wouldn't it be great if, then I started taking high-res screenshots armed with additional ideas and then assembled the layout I envisioned. The process took a whole darned week of late nights; coffee and making sure my son didn't roll off my desk until I was done. No problem.

The last box cover I was pretty much in charge of was Bungies [Myth: The Total Codex ](https://web.archive.org/web/20090204062435/http://www.bungie.net/News/%20http://www.bungie.net/perlbin/blam.pl?file=/site/3). I created the cover art, the whole box, in fact. The CD imprints, the manual, the ads, shelf talkers, even the set-up/installation interface graphics. The cover needed to portray three heroes; And they just needed to look heroic and be recognizable Myth characters. Sometimes box covers are easy that way.

In the case of the June 2003 OXM cover we wanted it to show the Chief in his new armor, and he basically just needed to look bad-ass. There were other elements we wanted to show: other Marines (in this case the ODSTs), a new environment (New Mombassa) and the Chief being able to use two guns at the same time (dual SMGs). And I just had to get it looking cool at the end of five days. And there we go. :)

Man, I want to go get some sleep, thinking about all those.

**Sketch** : In your mind, what are the most critical aspects to creating a ""successful"" cover?

**Lorraine:** Clarity. I should know what I'm looking at immediately, my eyes should be drawn to the main point(s) of interest and the message should be clear and, if at all possible, scream at me.

**Sketch** : What were your goals for this cover? Was there anything in particular that provided inspiration or direction?

**Lorraine:** With the OXM cover, we wanted to sort of continue where we left off with the announce trailer. We wanted to hint at what audiences would expect to see of Halo 2 at E3 2003. The Chief in his new armor. Two weapons, one on each hand. Hes on Earth. And hes fighting with the rest of the human race to fend off the Covenant. The general idea behind the whole thing was to say Holy -blam!-! It's the Chief in his new armor! Halo 2 is coming! He-he!

The announce trailer was a wonderful source of inspiration. You really get a sense of this bad-ass hero, a faceless, selfless soldier literally throwing himself into deaths maw to save the human race. Powerful and capable. I could only hope that my illustration did him justice.

  
**Sketch** : Can you walk us through the creation of the OXM cover?

**Lorraine:** When I'm illustrating something like this, I start with a bunch of thumbnails, basically unloading everything I can think of as fast as I can on a sheet of paper. I was a little hard pressed to come up with something that I hadn't already drawn before (particularly something that Oni's Konoko hadn't done before!). I was doodling on graph paper during that first phone conference with Holden Hume, OXM's art director. While we were talking, a picture of the Chief standing on top of a building popped into my head. He had a foot up on the edge and he was looking at the horizon behind the viewer. This idea emerged as just a mass of lines that showed limb positions, angles of objects in the sky (clouds or perspective of buildings) and an arrow that showed the direction the Chief would be looking. In my head, he was holding the Battle Rifle. But then as the conversation progressed, we wanted to see the Chief with the two SMGs, so I started drawing stick figures with two guns. We had leaning as a new feature, so I drew the Chief with two guns kind of leaning forward with guns ready. I didn't like it. After a few minutes, we got some specs, a sense of direction and a set of ideas to go on. And I also found out that I only had five days. Oh crap! I went to the drawing board and started sketching immediately!

That first image turned out to be the one that held the most promise. All the other poses failed to give a sense of hero or didn't provide a dynamic-enough pose. One shot, though, looked neat, was too close to a recent OXM cover with Sam Fisher of Splinter Cell.

  
To help me come up with poses more quickly, I started playing with the action figures at my desk. When I got the file of the proposed cover text, I started taking pictures of my [Stikfas ](https://web.archive.org/web/20090204062435/http://www.stikfas.com/)figures and dropping them in. Getting an idea of what might work, I grabbed more pictures and put them all on one file and printed them out so I could solicit feedback from Marcus and other artists like Robt and Shi Kai. After picking a couple, I printed out the poses and used that as the skeleton for the Chief. After a 13-hour Day 1, I drew up a pose we all liked and fired it off in e-mail so Holden could take a look at it in the morning.



Day two, I came in and loaded up Earth City on my dev kit and started flying around and started taking reference shots for the background. There were no textures to speak of, just geometry and lighting. The sky wasn't even finished. But all I needed were silhouettes of buildings anyway, so it was all good. We got the rest of the feedback that morning. I was happy to hear positive feedback, but there were a couple of requests that I wouldn't be able to implement until I get to the final run, so I forged ahead. I started throwing shadows onto the pencil sketch and started placing buildings into the picture. I then blocked in the other Marines behind the Chief. At the close of yet another long day, I had Robt render out two SMGs for me in the angle they would be shown and slapped it onto the Chief. I planned on painting right on top of the render from 3D Studio Max.

Needing sleep, I did some rudimentary brush strokes on the guns and I sent the last black and white rough for people to look at. I guess the OXM crew were also busy trying to put the rest of the magazine together because, just as I was wrapping up to go home, I got an e-mail back from Holden, saying that everybody left for the evening, but he really liked what he saw and that I should go ahead and start applying color. I just had enough time to start blocking in color before the day caught up with me.

Tired and feeling the effects of motion sickness from taking so many screenshots, I wanted nothing more than to get my 5-month-old son off my desk and head home to bed. I did find out later that Holden and the rest of the guys were really happy with what they saw and, even though it was just black and white, said that they can go with that cover if they really, really had to; that's how much they liked it.

For the next three days I would concentrate on coloring the Chief and getting the rest of the image close to finished. The file started ballooning to1 GB before I started paring down my file and getting rid of unused layers. 4am at the end of day five, I combine layers and get ready to send it all off. My memory of events is kinda hazy at this point. I don't even remember how I got the huge file over to OXM. I think Brian took care of it, but I can't recall much of that last day. But I do remember this: after having recuperated over the weekend, I forgot to sign the illustration. So the whole thing got printed with no artist signature. I slapped myself on the head. I couldn't believe it!

**Sketch** : How many different iterations did you work on before deciding on this particular image? Is the final image the one that you originally wanted to use?

**Lorraine:** There were only five other ideas for poses. There were two that we liked. But there was just no time to do a second one, so this final image was the one I took to the finish. And even so, I think I could have used another day or two to add some polish to it. About nine months later, the opportunity presented itself when a Halo 2 poster request came through the pipeline asking for the OXM cover as the image.



**Sketch** : What were some of the major challenges you had to overcome while working on this project?

**Lorraine:** The background. I didn't have enough time to experiment with it.

**Sketch** :Approximately how much time would you estimate that it took to create the finished cover?

**Lorraine:** Probably about 80 hours from the time I got the project to when I saved it and called it done.

**Sketch** : How does it feel knowing that your Halo 2 cover has gone on to become the most popular and largest selling issue in the history of OXM?

**Lorraine:** I feel pretty lucky. I honestly think that if the drawing was of somebody else and not the hero of Halo 2, I don't think it would have done as well.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1o67ve3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1o67ve3/when_the_rain_fell_sideways/,When the Rain Fell Sideways,"
It was one of those nights where the rain didn’t fall—it attacked.
Sideways sheets of water blurred everything into watercolor chaos.

Ethan stood under a half-broken bus shelter in downtown Seattle, pretending the plastic roof was doing something. It wasn’t. The bus app said Delayed for the third time. His phone battery hovered at 3%. His mood—worse.

Then she appeared.

Running across the street, soaked, clutching a paper bag to her chest like it carried treasure. She stopped under the same shelter, hair dripping, cheeks flushed. Her coat was useless.

“Seattle weather’s dramatic tonight,” she said, laughing.

He smiled despite himself. “Yeah. Feels personal.”

They stood side by side, the kind of silence that isn’t awkward yet. The rain filled it nicely.

“I’m Emma,” she said, finally.
“Ethan.”

He noticed the bag—an old-school record sleeve poking out.
“You collect vinyl?”
She grinned. “Yeah. I rescue them, actually. From people who think Spotify is enough.”

He laughed, and just like that, the world felt less soggy.

The bus never came. Neither of them minded.

They ended up walking to a coffee shop two blocks away—some dim, indie place still open because its owner refused to close for “mere weather.”
They shared a booth, coffee steaming between them, swapping stories about cities they hated leaving and people they’d never say goodbye to properly.

By the time the rain slowed, it was 1:00 a.m. He offered to walk her home. She refused, said she lived close.

At the door she smiled, tugged her damp hoodie tighter. “Thanks for not being weird.”
“Thanks for assuming I could’ve been.”

She laughed, stepped backward into the mist.
“Maybe I’ll see you when it rains again.”

He watched her disappear around the corner. He didn’t even get her last name.

Days passed. Then weeks.

Ethan went back to the same stop every evening. Some nights he brought coffee for two. He even checked every record store in the neighborhood. No Emma.

Seattle gave him everything—fog, traffic, rent hikes—but not her.

Eventually he stopped waiting. Mostly.

Three months later, while grabbing a late latte, he heard that same laugh behind him.
He turned.
Different girl. Different laugh.
Just a sound the universe recycled to keep him guessing.

He smiled anyway, told himself it was time to move on.

Then he noticed the café’s turntable spinning a record—its label smudged but familiar. The barista had scrawled a note on the jacket taped to the wall:

“Donated by Emma W., who said rain makes people honest.”

He stood there longer than he should’ve, coffee cooling in his hand.

Outside, drizzle returned—gentle, steady, Seattle-honest.

He didn’t chase ghosts anymore. But every time it rained, he’d still glance toward the street corner… just in case a girl with a record sleeve and that laugh decided the weather was finally worth remembering.",1,1760422607.0,stories,0,1.0,False
