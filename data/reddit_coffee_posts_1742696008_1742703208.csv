1jhqzqq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jhqzqq,This pattern for a coffee cup cozy is extremely confusing to me. I can’t figure out how to do the dc2togcl stitch “between” stitches.,"Can anyone explain this a different way? I don’t think it’s an actual decrease, because I’m supposed to repeat Row 2 until the end, so it would become a triangle. It doesn’t help that the reference picture on the pattern has two different cozy’s, so I don’t know what this is even supposed to look like. The part that says “Dc2togcl between next 2 dc2togCl” is my main point of confusion I think. 

I’m quite an experienced crocheter and usually understand new stitches so I feel like I’m going crazy. ",1,1742703125.0,CrochetHelp,1,1.0,False
1jhqyne,https://www.reddit.com/r/LagottoRomagnolo/comments/1jhqyne/when_does_it_or_does_it_get_easier/,When does it (or does it) get easier?,"Hi, looking for a bit of help or reassurance here with our gorgeous 6 month old puppy! When or do things get easier with this breed?

Some of the things i have been struggling with (and strategies I have tried) are:
- Recall: At home her recall is fairly consistent inside, but outside it’s a different story. Even with high reward you will try to get her to come (even from a metre away) when she’s looking right at you. In recent days bringing cheese for her walks only have seemed to help a bit. She has to be on a long leash, as she does sprint to the end of her lead frequently so I do not trust her to be off leash AT ALL. the end goal is to have her be able to come to off leash dog beaches or hikes but I cannot trust that she won’t run off at the moment she is out without a leash on. She had one moment as a pup where she got through the fence of an enclosed dog park and sprinted off across the road and now I’m anxious about even taking her to parks. 
- Distractions: she is highly distracted in the environment. This means that she does not “check in“ on walks, hardly walks loose lead and will try to meet every dog that passes by (doesn’t bark, more just wants to run over to sniff). We try to do polite passing while sitting/walking daily and trying to gain her attention with high value rewards, but she seems to be so stimulated by her environment and other people that she doesn’t even care about what we have to offer
- FOMO: she has a crate she sleeps in attached to a play pen. When we are out of the house, we leave her with enrichment and she CAN go 6-7 hours without barking . However if we go into a room OR she is in her pen and she can hear/see us, she starts crying/barking. I’ve tried having her stand outside the room and gradually increasing  and rewarding. She’s particularly bad if we are upstairs getting ready for the day
- Eating/ chewing everything: in the house she chews some furniture (couch, cupboards) despite having so many chew toys (bene bones, coffee wood chews, kongs, and more). It’s worse on walks. She knows the leave it/drop it command at home, but won’t listen to the command outside. This has lead to me many times trying to reel her in with the lead or chase her to stick my hands in her mouth to get sticks, plastic etc out of her mouth. She just won’t swap out for even for high value treats. I think because of this I have created resource guarding for her. 
- Digging:. we take her out regularly to dig at the beach and have a little sandpit at home as an outlet. She has basically dug up half the backyard (now all covered) and constantly digs up the couch
- Not relaxing: have tried a relaxation protocol which is working a little bit with her, but is still very curious and tries to get into everything at home ie wont sit still. This leads to the above behaviours, digging/chewing etc 

I know there is a lot there, but I’m starting to worry whether this is normal (Lagotto) puppy behaviour and it gets easier. I feel like I’m spending 2+ hours per day training her with all these things and am so worried that I am doing something completing wrong and she won’t get better. She is clever, and really good the right behaviours when she knows she is doing training. 

Our circumstances have also changed, that we now have to move out from our house to an apartment so things like barking/crying particularly worry me. 

Any reassurance or strategies would be so helpful!

Ps we are not looking at ecollars (I think it’s illegal here anyways) and all of our trainers have been big on positive reinforcement which I agree with

1jhqyah,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jhqyah/i_think_my_ex_wants_me_back_after_10_years/,i think my ex wants me back after 10 years,"Hi so uhm let me give you a little context:  
I (27f) dated this guy lets call him J back when I was 16 for 9 months. I know 9 months sounds small and silly but we were really serious about each other talked about starting a family and what not (sounds stupid but it was teenage love) like we were everyones favourite couple everyone loved us together we would've taken a bullet for another person basically when we were in love nothing mattered, even when we brokeup people couldn't believe it as everyone including us thought we were end game. He ended our relationship due to some reasons back then and we were still into each other months after breaking up but couldn't be together as it was toxic to both of us. 

After a point ofc I moved on from him (he didn't),he did try to reach out to me once but I shut him down as I had already started talking to my now fiance M and also falling for him. I also got with that following april. 

I had known M ever since we were in 6th grade and dated for a month back in 9th grade but realised it was stupid and remained friends ever since 3 years went by and we never really talked much we checked up on each other here and there but that's pretty much it. 

Now what happened in the present:

So a few days ago I had gone to this supermarket in my hometown to buy groceries and stuff.

Over there I accidentally rammed my shopping cart into a man standing in front of me and immediately went over to him to say sorry to my surprise that was my ex. I have had no contact with him for the past 10 years whatever knowledge I have about him is because of the mutuals we are still in touch with and as far as I know he sometimes does ask about me and what I am up to. 

We both obviously recognize each other and said hi and talk about where we work whats been up with our mutual friends and stuff for about 15ish mins after which he asks me if we could have coffee together at this coffee place really close to the store I politely refused as I pointed at my ring to show that I'm engaged. 

He grabbed my hand bring it closer to his face to see the ring up close and said it looked good. This made me uncomfortable for obvious reasons so I pulled my hand my back and smiled at him. He told me how my fiance was lucky to have me and asked when the wedding was. 

As the conversation was coming to an end (it had been around 20-25 mins since we started talking) he asked me if I was going to a small get together of our school friends at our mutual friends house, which is next week and I said yes as I am still pretty close friends with him after all these years. To which he said he couldn't wait to see me in a weird way (?) and we both walked away.

Now I don't know what to do as I am getting a strong gut feeling to stay away from him and might actually cancel on going to my friends small party even tho I had been looking forward to it for quiet a while.

1jhqv1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1jhqv1z/partner_doesnt_help_around_the_house_and_im_at_my/,Partner doesnt help around the house and im at my wits end,"I want to start this off by saying I have ADHD and very very severe depression and nearly debilitating social anxiety/social phobia, yet I work 36 hours a week and im a full time student spending roughly 16 hours in class per week not including studying, and I am pursuing an internship. I am also not medicated or treated for any of my “ailments” so i just rawdog life (waiting for insurance) and i am not well at all but im chugging along at half speed so i can make my goals. 

My partner (who i love dearly) works about 8-10 hours a week now that their hours are cut and thats really it, and complains if they have more than 25 and gets super overwhelmed if its a 30 hour week and thinks thats a lot. Hardly any responsibilities other than that. They also have similar issues as far as ADHD and depression go. 

The reason i say this is because I cook and do pretty much a majority of the cleaning. I also take care of all of my pets as well with little to no help from anyone else. 

We rent a house and its a pretty good size for two adults. Not very big so in theory it should be easy to clean … I am by no means a neat freak. AT ALL. i can be messy and get overwhelmed with my life and just veg out when i get home because im zonked. 

For example When i get home the house is still filthy. Dishes in the sink from the night before, cat litter all over the floor, cans all over the coffee table, garbage all over the counters … and my partner is just chillin in the office on discord playing a game and then goes “oh sorry you cleaned the other day so i didnt think it needed to be cleaned” and every time i can feel the vein on my forehead grow bigger. 

When i tell you i have talked to them nicely dozens of times. I have complained. I have been passive aggressive. I have made suggestions on how we can work together to keep things cleaned. I get “ill make sure im keeping up with my end of things” and theyll clean immediately or clean here and there intermittently for like 3 days and then its back to where its been. So they are MORE than aware that this is an ongoing issue. 

And then had the nerve to say “i clean too!” And then i laughed and they said “not recently but i have” and i cant recall a time where the cleaned just for the sake of cleaning a dirty house. I understand depression as good as anyone. I understand avoidance as well as anyone. But when you share a living space with someone you should be respectful. I should not have to ask a 29 year old adult to clean their own house that we lease together. 

And THEY HAVE THE NERVE TO POUT and give me an attitude when i fucking ask sometimes. Or theyll be like “i have to work in an hour so i cant” and im like are you fucking kidding me? its 4pm. You couldve at least helped with dishes or picked up trash. I get that sometimes i get up at 8am and clean on my day off so theres not much to do at times, but 9/10 its not because i want to start my fucking day. I probably got up to piss and then something grossed me out and then i ended up cleaning the entire house because im already doing it and i hate when my space is dirty. I am NOT a neat freak btw. I am messy as fuck and can be very lazy. Im Just not into dirt and grime and i dont enjoy a dirty space. 

And its not like they dont do anything for me. They are a fantastic human being and take care of me in different ways. Im just tired and i need a partner. Housework can be a lot for one person when two people make a mess. I work very hard even if it seems like an easy normal person schedule (like i said i also have very bad depression and ADHD and this is impossible to manage at times so this schedule is difficult for me.) 

And i suppose the same could be said for my partner. I get that it can be stressful for them too but its a pretty fun job and they have all kinds of friends there and go drinking after work until 3AM here and there. So i guess its kinda hard when i sacrifice a lot of my time and still end up doing all the cooking and cleaning. 

Im also kinda disappointed because i never got a birthday gift … i bought them something on my birthday and brunch when we went out with my friends. Idk is it materialistic for me to be sad about that? they got me some food from some restaurant i wanted to try the night before so i guess i should be grateful. 

Im just kinda worried about this long term. Weve been together for years now and I have all kinds of career goals even though im a little old for new career goals now, and they still work at a bar … and are kinda job hunting but not for jobs in their professional field. Mostly looking when i ask and i get a lot of “aaawww shit, i meant to do it today but got wrapped up”. Theyve told me they lied to me about working on that kind of thing in the past so who knows. Its also concerning because most of their coworkers/friends are in their early 20s so my partner is kinda living life like we did when we met which isnt really my thing anymore. They always want me to meet their friends at bars and house parties … not really my thing. Ill just fade into a corner and wait until its over because im a loser whos too anxious to have fun with randos ive never met in a loud chaotic environment. I also have like 3 sensory disorders which make parties and shows very stressful and ive emphasized id love to meet them for lunch, go for a walk, go to an event, or have them over for dinner and we can play games and stuff before we go somewhere like a bar but my partner wont meet me half way so ive met like a small group of them. 

Im also not gonna be a sugar daddy if i actually manage to finish grad school and get a good job. No dice. They will have to work too even if its part time. 

And we moved out of state together and it took so long for them to actually pull the trigger on moving because its like the dug their heels in while they lived at home with their parents after they sold the house we were renting before. 

Shit i hate working too lol. But I cant dig us out of any holes and im not going to. I just wish they had a little more career ambition … they have ambition with other things … just not a career. 


Oh yeah, me and my partner HAVE talked about all of these things dozens of times and nothing ever changes. So idk what the fuck to do because i love them and dont want to be with anyone else. They have a lot of amazing qualities and we have a very close relationship. They are literally the best friend ive ever had and Im far from perfect and they have their gripes too. I just wish they would see a therapist and work on their depression issues because i clearly cant really help.

1. EDC, lite tech - tablet, kindle, headphones, journal, water, light lunch in Tupperware. 

Or 

2. Packing an extra set of light clothes / light layers.  Such as light sweaters, and extra part of short,.etc.  and water + lunch in ziploc bag. 

I want to keep the sling on the smaller, lighter, more travel friendly side. But would be open to a larger sling if it fits all the needs.  

I have 2 goals, to have something bigger than my 2L fanny pack when I want to spend more time out and do more entertain/education Or functionally carry things i need all day in the city.  

Two, When not being work-task oriented, I want to use it for adventure travels like light hiking and beach days.  So carrying a towel, extra clothes, etc.   

I use a 22L TBF Berkeley when I carry my laptop and all work needs.  So I'm looking for something smaller and more movement/freedom focused. 

When doing my research I've found the water bottle to be a limiting factor.  I carry a 22oz water bottle or 16oz coffee thermos.  

I've come down to these choices based in my research

1 - North Face Borealis Slinf 
2 - Hydroflask Slingback
3 - Camelbak Arete 8L 
4 - Osprey Daylight Sling 
5 - Patagonia Atom 

I like the northface the best but you need to put the water bottle inside, so i don't know how much room i would have for clothes. 

I like the other 4, but they just miss on aeathetics for me.  And I'm not sure how they would fit the load outs I mentioned above.

1jhqptf,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/comments/1jhqptf/my_tale_a_journey_of_infatuation_obsession_and/,"My Tale: A Journey of Infatuation, obsession and much more","Story is real. Character names changed. I never imagined I’d find myself in this situation. I’m Simp—a dedicated professional, a loving husband, and a loyal friend. But lately, my life feels like a whirlwind, all because of someone I never expected to have this kind of effect on me.

It all starts when Cocaine joins our office. She’s charming, friendly, and effortlessly makes everyone around her feel special—including me. At first, I brush it off. She’s just another colleague, someone I exchange pleasantries with during coffee breaks. But as days pass, something inside me shifts. I start thinking about her more than I should. Her laughter lingers in my mind, her casual gestures seem to carry hidden meanings, and her presence becomes a distraction I can’t escape.

I don’t understand why this is happening. I’m married, after all, and Cocaine has never shown any romantic interest in me. Yet, these feelings persist, pulling me deeper into emotional chaos.

Cocaine’s behavior only adds to my confusion. During office hours, she’s warm and engaging, often inviting me for tea or casual chats. But after work, she keeps her distance—no messages, no plans, nothing. I tell myself it’s just professionalism, but my heart aches for more.

To make things worse, my good friend Stud seems to have a different relationship with Cocaine. They don’t interact much at work, but I can’t help but notice the late nights they spend together. I’ve seen them a couple of times—laughing over coffee, walking side by side, sharing moments that feel too intimate for comfort. Every time I witness this, it feels like a dagger to my heart. I can’t help but wonder—why is Cocaine so distant with me but so close to Stud? What does he have that I don’t?

This emotional turmoil consumes me. To avoid seeing them together, I wander aimlessly after work, delaying my return home. But even at home, I find no escape. I lie awake at night, replaying every interaction, every glance, every word. Sleep becomes elusive, and my nights grow longer and lonelier. Desperate for relief, I resort to sleeping pills, hoping they’ll quiet my mind and give me the rest I desperately need.

As if this pain isn’t enough, the sound of Stud’s bullet bike haunts me. Stud and I are neighbors, and the deep, rumbling roar of his bullet is unmistakable. Every time I hear that sound late in the evening, my heart sinks. Even though many people in the society own bullet bikes, my mind immediately jumps to the worst conclusion—Stud is on his way to meet Cocaine. The sound becomes a trigger, dragging me into a spiral of negative thoughts. I picture them together, laughing, sharing secrets, growing closer while I lie alone in bed, consumed by jealousy and sadness. The bullet’s roar isn’t just a sound anymore—it’s a painful reminder of everything I feel I’m missing.

Stud, being the candid friend he is, doesn’t make things easier. One day, he casually mentions, “Cocaine’s always dropping hints for a physical relationship.” Those words hit me hard. I feel a pang of jealousy, but at the same time, I experience a strange sense of clarity. If Cocaine is so openly flirting with Stud, what does that say about her character? And more importantly, why am I wasting so much of my energy on someone who clearly doesn’t value me the way I deserve?

With a heavy heart but a determined mind, I finally make a decision. I won’t let Cocaine’s actions control my emotions any longer. I choose to focus on my marriage, my career, and my own growth. This realization feels liberating. It’s like a veil has been lifted from my eyes. I’m not naive or foolish—I’m human. And this experience, as painful as it’s been, has taught me a valuable lesson about emotional boundaries and self-worth.

As days go by, I slowly reclaim my life. I spend more quality time with my spouse, reigniting the spark that had dimmed during this emotional storm. At work, I immerse myself in my projects, rediscovering the passion and drive that once defined me. I even start building healthier connections with colleagues, ensuring that my interactions remain grounded in mutual respect.

I’m moving forward, step by step. And for the first time in a long while, I feel like I’m finally back in control of my own story.

We are trying to become more self sustaining but I’m drawing a blank on what I might be missing so any suggestions are welcome. Note im in a tropical location. It rarely gets below 65 or above 90.

2 zucchini plants
1 20x2 bed of Lima beans
One 2ft round bed of asparagus 
4 50 gallon planters each with a different pepper (bell, jalapeño, poblano, yellow banana)….. although they are not doing as well as I’d like but they are new so maybe they just need to settle in. 
2 20 gallon planters with artichokes 
1 6x2 bed of blue berries
1 pepper vine
1 vanilla vine
4 lilicoi plants
And herbs (basil, marjoram, parsley, oregano, dill, rosemary, thyme)

Just wondering if anyone has any suggestions. 
Alhamdulillah I have been a Muslim for 16 years. But this Ramadan feels like the most disconnected I’ve been. I’m studying in another country and very stressed etc. and been staying up all night working on my thesis, but from a broader perspective I just don’t connect with the Muslim community. I’m not married and I’m in my 30s (F) and I don’t think people know what to do with me, plus there’s a language barrier. I’m very friendly and alhamdulillah now have B2 but I just…feel invisible at the masjid. Almost invariably when I meet other Muslims the questions are “are you married/do you have kids?” and/or “how did you convert?” I’m happy to answer because I want to help people think about the religion etc. inshaAllah but I just feel like people interact with me basically on that level. I’ve tried to make Muslim friends but I just…already struggle to really click with people (I’m good at getting along with people alhamdulillah - just not making deeper friendships easily) and for example this woman and I planned and failed to get coffee and then we read Quran together at the masjid alhamdulillah but I felt like that was it and I didn’t quite make a friend. I’ve been here for a year and a half. I’ve even managed to make non-Muslim native German friends which let me tell you is not easy, especially in adulthood, so alhamdulillah. But.

I don’t really know what to do. I am too tired to do much worship but at least my thesis etc. is for Allah’s sake. I just feel separate and I don’t know why. I’m struggling to do anything worship-wise during Ramadan, and to want to keep trying with the Muslim community here.

To make things worse, I think people have kind of forgotten I exist. I think I got like one Ramadan Mubarak message from someone.

Anyway. Hope everyone’s Ramadan is going well.

I spoke to this guy on Tinder. He wanted to meet up. I suggested we meet for coffee. He insisted on making me dinner at his place, even though I said mutliple times that there is no need, but I eventually gave in. He lived far away, so I was going to Uber to his place and back. He suggested I bring my laptop so I can work from his place in the morning. I thought that might be too soon, so I made an excuse about needing to be back home. Like what if he doesn’t like me and then is stuck with me? I told him I will Uber back home. He insisted that he will drop me back home in his car. It was “non negotiable”. I thought that was super sweet and I accepted.

Went to his place. He had made an amazing dinner. He was constantly flirtatious, even though I wasn’t at first (i’m always hesitant to flirt first, because I need to be sure the other person actually likes me first). I kept giggling and blushing. Then he made some tea, we were talking, ended up making out. I wasn’t “prepared” to have sex, because I really thought we were meeting casually first, so we didn’t have sex, but we did orals. The entire time he was giving me compliments, telling me how attracted he is to me, he wanted to take me out for dinner. Like he even planned that we could take a hiking trip some day. Like non-stop telling me he likes me. 

When we were leaving his place, he again asked me to stay over. I told him this isn’t the last time we’re meeting. I’ll stay over next time. He packed me a goody bag of snacks to take home. I told him not to. But he was so cute and sweet, and he insisted that I take it.

He already had plans to meet his friends on Saturday, but he wanted to cancel them to meet me. I told him not to. I told him we can meet during the weekdays. He asked me if I have any plans for Saturday? I told him, “No. I have zero plans. But don’t cancel your plans. If you REALLY REALLY wants to meet me on Saturday, you can cancel your plans and we’ll meet.”

After he dropped me off home, I sent him a message and thanked him. I told him he is the nicest guy I have come across in a long time. He replied by thanking me, and also said (and I quote) “And your a** gosh how much I love it 😈” AND added on to that, “I won something huge tonight”

It was all so cute!! I couldn’t wait to message him again and meet him again. I sent him a message tonight, and he replied, “Hey! You’re a great guy but i’m going to pursue something more serious with another guy i’ve been speaking to”. The message was longer than this, but that was the gist of it.

I’m so heartbroken and annoyed. I wasn’t even looking for this. I’m 31 years old. I have met some TERRIBLE men. Even the nice men are almost always emotionally unavailable. Or they live in a different city and country, and I only met them while on vacation. Or there is just something that results in bad timing for both of us. I have learnt to keep my walls up. I don’t let “just about anyone” make me feel so vulnerable. I don’t even like being provided with special treatment, or affection, or praises, or compliments. If I hook up with someone, and they keep complimenting me, I feel like they’re lying.

But with this guy, I really thought I had found **something**

I got a new off-brand magic bullet / personal blender thing. There are two lines on the cup, both of which have since pretty much entirely washed away, and have been way over-measuring my protein shakes. This is relevant, I swear.

I lost 100+ lbs last year from February - November. Diet went great, everything worked out well. 

Holidays came around and luckily I was able to at least maintain between 188-192 lbs from Dec - January when I got this stupid ass blender. 

For the last three months, my scale’s been broken and I’ve only been weighing myself sporadically throughout the month whenever someone I know has a scale or at the grocery store, which yes is inconsistent, but stay with me.

February I weighed in at 192. Not terrible, lowest was 188, holidays just passed , no biggie. Keep going, weigh myself again at the beginning of March. 193. Uhhh what the fuck? Different scale, so a few days later I weighed in at the grocery store again - 192.

Okay now this is over a month out, zero weight lost even though I’m sticking to my diet again just as closely as I did all year last year. 

Today, I weighed in at that same store - 195lbs, hadn’t eaten that day. Now, granted it was cold out today so I had jeans, two shirts, a jacket, my wallet and my phone in my pockets, but accounting for all that, let’s say 3 lbs, that leaves me at…192.

What the fuck is happening? I’m not retaining water, I actually stopped taking creatine like four months ago. Eating everything like I normally did, same meal prep, same shakes, everything is the same…except this god damn blender.

Two lines, on the box the diagram says the first line is 0.5 cups, second is 1 cup. 

So I measure out the “0.5 cups” line into an actual measuring cup… One fucking cup.

Second line? 2 cups. 

Am I bad at eyeing out food? Yes, apparently - but hey, listen, it’s a weird, tallish kinda oddly shaped tumbler thing. Idk man I just trusted the box.

I was having on average 1-3 protein shakes a day, “1” cup of whole milk? “1” cup of black coffee, scoop of protein.

Except “1” cup is actually fucking two, and I’ve been slamming an extra 150 calories *per god damn shake*, so between an extra 300-450 calories *a day* for almost three months. 

I’ve been eating at maintenance thinking I was in a 350 calorie deficit for *three months*.

Looking back I was actually surprised at how much my biceps and upper pecs had started popping out so far this year during what I thought was a deficit-assisted recomp. Turns out it’s just a full blown recomp…

SO KIDS, what’d we learn? Don’t trust shitty off-brand temu magic bullet measurements. Measure your food - *properly*. 

UGH alright, now it’s time to *actually resume losing weight*.

1jhqedp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1jhqedp/i_think_i_finally_have_fixed_being_chronically/,I think I finally have fixed being chronically online,"Starting a few years ago I started teaching music online and started making a lot of content for social media sites. I learned a lot about creativity and doing longer term projects, but I quickly learned how much it exasperated my already pretty strong drive to be online constantly scrolling and checking my feeds/notifications.  Thus began a several year long escapade into reading about digital minimalism, daily journaling, explorations of dumb phones and more.  I wish i could say, “just delete all of your accounts” but I need these spaces to promote my business, I need them for networking.  It was a problem. How exactly do stop this compulsion I have while still having/maintaining my online studio?


And what I can say is without a doubt the only good salve I got for this problem was this: 

1) Get a secondary device.  Cheaper the better, second hand, and keep this as your primary phone in your pocket.  I tried a dumb phone, but honestly It drove me crazy  owing SIM cards, not having syncing between devices and all that.  I just used a fancier iPhone as the content creation device and a cheap second hand se as my main device. Once you have it, the content phone never leaves my desk where I teach and make content for students. I post from it there, I record there, I scroll the few apps I use from that spot occasionally.  But once I am done I don’t take it to other parts of the house and I never take it outside. 

2) you got to go out and make in person relationships at least 2-3 times a week. Go to workshops at the library, find a coffee shop that you go to everyday and make friends with the baristas,  (don’t be creepy, just say hello and small talk until you know everyone’s name and they know yours.) go find an activist/mutual aid group to be a part of.  Just get out of your house and do the uncomfortable work of knowing and being known.  

Tonight is one of my first free nights since new years and I finally sat down to catch up on content and stuff and begun realizing just how much it doesn’t serve me anymore.  Scrolling around Reddit, instagram, etc. just doesn’t seem like healthy or fun dopamine anymore. it doesn’t feel like a replacement for genuine connection.  I watched it for a few minutes trying to go from platform to platform and it just didn’t do it for me anymore.  So instead, I started doing some laundry, made some dinner, and wrote a friend instead.  It was only after all of these things that I realized how much my life had changed in t(e last year.  Ass much as the world sucks ass right now, I can’t stress to y’all enough how much getting out of my house and getting the apps out of my daily pocket changed my life for the better.

I did some research and found from body building bros doing 'cuts' (calories restriction) it's pretty common for low caloric intake to really mess with your sleep. I run my own business and study and I need to sleep, so I quit one meal a day. I also suffer from ow iron levels and starting bruising badly and experiencing disruptive amount of fatigue. So I re introduced meat. At the end of the day when I get into bed and I should say the rosary, I end up grabbing my book (which is fantasy) because I'm tired and stressed and just want to read fantasy until my eyes get heavy and I fall asleep. 
The only thing I've been able to uphold is not drinking coffee. And when the priest today mentioned we are halfway through our Lenten journey, the amount of anticipation for coffee I felt was disappointing to say the least.

I know there are probably a hundred posts like this already, but here we go again.

I run a small local restaurant, and today a customer—literally just sitting there minding their business—almost got bit by someone’s dog. And of course, the dog owner clearly didn’t care that we have signs posted everywhere saying no dogs allowed inside (unless it’s a service animal). I’m honestly at my limit with these entitled dog owners. And I say this as someone who likes dogs—what I can’t stand is the humans who drag them into places they shouldn’t be, and act like the world revolves around their “fur baby.”

What I’m trying to figure out is: is there any kind of legal language or signage that actually works? Something that goes beyond “No Dogs Allowed” and can shut down the inevitable arguments? Or do we just have to keep playing dog-cop every day?

And to be clear, this isn’t just my place. I’ve had dogs sniff my legs at coffee shops, even go nose-first into my plate at a casual dinner. It’s getting out of hand. We’ve normalized something that makes no sense. I get it—people love their pets. But we need boundaries, especially when it comes to food and public safety.

Honestly this is half rant, half call for ideas. Is there a petition we can start? A collective policy for local businesses? Has anyone found a solution that actually sticks?

# 💥 OpenAI Study Finds Links Between ChatGPT Use and Loneliness

A recent study by OpenAI, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has revealed that higher usage of chatbots like ChatGPT may be associated with increased feelings of loneliness and reduced social interactions with others. The research indicates that individuals who frequently engage with ChatGPT tend to report greater emotional dependence on the chatbot and spend less time socializing in person.

* Research by OpenAI and MIT indicates that using ChatGPT for ""personal conversations"" may be linked to increased loneliness, especially among users who engage emotionally with the chatbot.
* The negative impacts of these interactions are more pronounced in individuals with a strong tendency toward attachment and those who perceive the AI as a friend.
* The findings were based on a Randomized Controlled Trial with 1,000 users and an analysis of 40 million interactions, highlighting a niche use case for emotional conversations with ChatGPT.

What this means: While AI chatbots offer convenience and immediate responses, overreliance on them for companionship could potentially impact users’ mental health and real-world social connections. It’s essential to balance AI interactions with human engagements to maintain emotional well-being.

# 🫠 CEO of AI Ad-Tech Firm Pledging “World Free of Fraud” Sentenced for Fraud

In a turn of events, the CEO of an AI advertising technology company, who had previously advocated for eliminating fraud in the industry, has been sentenced for fraudulent activities. This development underscores the importance of transparency and ethical practices within the AI and advertising sectors.

* In May 2024, Kubient's website described the company as a leader in combatting digital ad fraud, featuring a blog post on strategies for achieving a fraud-free world.
* Kubient's CEO, Paul Roberts, pleaded guilty to fraudulently inflating the company's revenue by $1.3 million to enhance its IPO, leading to a prison sentence of one year and one day.
* Prosecutors revealed Roberts orchestrated a fraudulent billing scheme with another company, producing fake reports using non-existent data to mislead auditors and fabricate revenue.

What this means: The incident highlights the need for robust regulatory frameworks and ethical standards in AI-driven industries to prevent misuse and maintain public trust. Companies must align their practices with their stated values to foster credibility and integrity.

[Read More](https://www.wtaj.com/news/regional-news/ai-has-been-beneficial-for-pennsylvania-state-workers-governor-shapiro-says/)

Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania praised AI adoption across state agencies, citing increased productivity, reduced administrative burden, and better service delivery. AI tools are now being used for document processing, constituent outreach, and fraud detection.

What this means: Pennsylvania sets a governance precedent for responsible AI adoption in public service. Other states and nations may follow suit as governments modernize operations with intelligent automation. It’s a model for pro-human, pro-AI collaboration in bureaucracy.

* Claude provides direct citations for web-sourced information, allowing users to verify sources and fact-check responses easily.
* The feature is now available to all paid Claude users in the U.S., with international and free-tier expansion planned for the near future.
* Users can also access the feature by toggling on the ‘Web Search’ tool in the profile settings of the platform.

**What this means:** Claude’s ability to search the web in real-time enhances its accuracy and relevance, making it a more effective tool for tasks requiring the latest information. This positions Claude competitively among AI chatbots, offering users a more dynamic and informed conversational experience.

# 💥 OpenAI Study Finds Links Between ChatGPT Use and Loneliness

A recent study by OpenAI, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has revealed that higher usage of chatbots like ChatGPT may be associated with increased feelings of loneliness and reduced social interactions with others. The research indicates that individuals who frequently engage with ChatGPT tend to report greater emotional dependence on the chatbot and spend less time socializing in person.

* Research by OpenAI and MIT indicates that using ChatGPT for ""personal conversations"" may be linked to increased loneliness, especially among users who engage emotionally with the chatbot.
* The negative impacts of these interactions are more pronounced in individuals with a strong tendency toward attachment and those who perceive the AI as a friend.
* The findings were based on a Randomized Controlled Trial with 1,000 users and an analysis of 40 million interactions, highlighting a niche use case for emotional conversations with ChatGPT.

**What this means:** While AI chatbots offer convenience and immediate responses, overreliance on them for companionship could potentially impact users’ mental health and real-world social connections. It’s essential to balance AI interactions with human engagements to maintain emotional well-being.

Tencent has announced the development of a new AI model designed to compete with DeepSeek, aiming to enhance natural language understanding and generation capabilities. This move signifies Tencent’s commitment to advancing AI research and its applications across various sectors.

* Tencent launched its new 'T1' reasoning model, which uses large-scale reinforcement learning similar to DeepSeek's R1 model, and outperformed it on the MMLU Pro benchmark.
* The T1 model achieved 91.8 points in the C-Eval suite for Chinese language skills, matching DeepSeek-R1 and surpassing OpenAI's o1, which scored 87.8 in this evaluation.
* Tencent's T1 offers competitive pricing, charging 1 yuan per million tokens for input and 4 yuan for output, matching DeepSeek-R1's rates during daytime hours.

**What this means:** The introduction of Tencent’s AI model could lead to more sophisticated AI applications, offering users improved experiences in areas such as virtual assistants, content creation, and customer service. It also intensifies competition in the AI industry, potentially accelerating innovation and development.

# 🤖 Meta Tests AI-Generated Comments on Instagram

Meta is experimenting with a feature that allows users to generate AI-suggested comments on Instagram posts. Users can tap a “Write with Meta AI” prompt to receive comment suggestions tailored to the content they’re viewing. This feature is currently in the testing phase and has been spotted by select users.

* Meta is reportedly experimenting with a new tool that uses artificial intelligence to generate comments on Instagram posts.
* The feature was discovered by Jonah Manzano, an X user who is recognized for testing features on social media platforms.
* Users can see a ""Write with Meta AI"" prompt on Instagram, offering AI-driven suggestions for comments on their friends' content.

**What this means:** While this feature aims to enhance user engagement by simplifying interactions, it raises concerns about authenticity and the potential for increased bot-like behavior on social media platforms. Users and creators may need to navigate the balance between convenience and genuine interaction.

# 🫠 CEO of AI Ad-Tech Firm Pledging “World Free of Fraud” Sentenced for Fraud

In a turn of events, the CEO of an AI advertising technology company, who had previously advocated for eliminating fraud in the industry, has been sentenced for fraudulent activities. This development underscores the importance of transparency and ethical practices within the AI and advertising sectors.

* In May 2024, Kubient's website described the company as a leader in combatting digital ad fraud, featuring a blog post on strategies for achieving a fraud-free world.
* Kubient's CEO, Paul Roberts, pleaded guilty to fraudulently inflating the company's revenue by $1.3 million to enhance its IPO, leading to a prison sentence of one year and one day.
* Prosecutors revealed Roberts orchestrated a fraudulent billing scheme with another company, producing fake reports using non-existent data to mislead auditors and fabricate revenue.

**What this means:** The incident highlights the need for robust regulatory frameworks and ethical standards in AI-driven industries to prevent misuse and maintain public trust. Companies must align their practices with their stated values to foster credibility and integrity.

1jhq3ie,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/1jhq3ie/im_delusional_again/,I'm delusional again,"For few months now it has been so low. My partner already said he was feeling detached since couple months ago. Feeling my toxicity since last year too. And all has been downhill till now. But I am still delusional that maybe we can be the best partners out there. Yeah I just messaged him again, although blocked, that I still wanna be partners. 

We came to the point that I told him he might have been my subject of obsession. And what's worst, I have been obsessed with others before as we analyzed my life. But here I am still telling him he should be the last obsession I have in this lifetime. So take a chance and use it. Truly, that's what I kept telling myself. I want to make a new life from this obsession with him right now. But for the past few months, the obsession wasn't giving him any good. I was obsessed cause he was good and loved me. But I wasn't doing enough to make sure that the object of my obsession stays and feels good about staying.

I wanna change everything from the start. I wanna just like him and love him without selfish intentions. And not get obsessed. Not get only happy that I benefit. Not only get frustrated if he doesn't want what I keep offering. I wanna love. I wanna be partners again. Like on that first month. Yet even our first month was my lies and toxicity against him.

But here I am delusional. Maybe he is alive. Maybe he is there. Try to be beside me. Maybe be with me through therapy. Him too, treatments while I am beside him. Maybe couple's therapy. Have help from someone, the both of us. But even before we get to be beside each other, the path is.. the same situation as us before. We would need to wait weeks before I can go there. So we need to interact how we were before. No one from us is changing just yet. His hurt from me not even slightly healed. My behavior just still the same as ever. I know it was never him who needs to adjust. It is me who needs to change. But we are too broken right now. 

And yet here I am I cannot let go of my delusions and my imaginations that we might still have a chance. Cause deep inside me it is not just obsession. I love him and I am so scared that he might not even be around anymore. I want so bad to wake up in the morning and feel him breathing to my skin. To maybe cook us breakfast, one with good protein. Or then drink coffee, how did he know from the first time that I love black coffee. Or then eat lunch, something spicy cause tons of food there are. And not any other person to wake up with. It should be him. With his familiar face. Whatever is different from him on screen and him on person, he is familiar. It should be him with that voice. The voice with his own accent than mine. Mine which is a bit funny sometimes, and bit angry tone naturally. With a same language spoken, hoping language of love still is there too. 

I want him. Is that sentence from obsession? That I want him? I want him and me in life. Now could that be sentence somewhat from love? I cannot escape delusions. And maybe that will help me stay in this status, so that possibility of him coming back and staying, albeit so so miniscule by now, I am still here. And it is him who chooses, and at least for a long time he has the choice of me. Right? 

I hope he is still around. And if it is not me anymore who he chooses during that, I should respect.",1,1742699955.0,NPD,1,0.67,False

I’ll have a rental car and don’t need to worry about budget, within reason (no C$200 fancy steak dinners, please…)

Ray's mind swelled with theories as he left the ASA building, lost in thought all the way home. It was half past midnight by the time he arrived—when he ought to have been home at eight.

He stepped inside to find Thomason lying asleep on the living room couch, a half-empty bottle of wine on the table beside her.

He knelt down and reached to wake her. She stirred, groggy, blinking up at him. ""Turned out a year was right on the mark..."" Her voice was thick with sleep. ""How'd it go with the intern?""

Ray recounted the day's events, but before long, his excitement overtook him. ""Dear, I have learned something truly extraordinary. Mr Logan has tasked me with helping solve it.""

""Learned of what?"" she mumbled.

""... A pulse. In deep space.""

""A... pulse? Deep space?""

""JX-914 to be precise.""

She rubbed her eyes. ""Hang on—how in God's name could you lot detect something from so far out?""

""That is precisely what we intend to determine.""

Thomason let out a tired groan and sat up, running a hand through her hair. ""I barely know what you scientists are up to these days... Life was so much simpler before.""

She stood and stretched. ""You coming, or is this another of your all-nighters?""

Ray had already turned toward his study. ""I shan't be long.""

Thomason sighed, and before entering the bedroom, said, ""Your dinner is in the kitchen, heated, of course.""



What followed were three feverish hours of chalk dust clotting the air, and calculations scrawled in frantic succession.

""... No gravitational displacement... no heat signature... pulse periodicity remains fixed, yet undamped... What medium does it even propagate through?""

""The energy required—unfathomable... would necessitate an emitter of—no, impossible, no mass displacement...""
""Waveform's consistent—regular intervals—origin point unaccounted for...""

He worked until his mind frayed, yet nothing yielded. No pattern emerged, no hypothesis held firm. The equations stood unbreakable.

At last, bloodshot and aching, he sighed, tossing his chalk into its holder before trudging to the bedroom.

Easing the door open, he found Thomason fast asleep. But as he slipped beneath the covers, he paused.

A newspaper article on the nightstand read:
""South New London Under Siege – Evacuations Ordered""

Thomason spoke: ""Mother was ever one to leave her home.""



Thomason woke with a slow, steady breath, blinking as the morning light crept through the curtains. 

She combed her fingers through her hair, taming what she could, then sat up with a quiet sigh. 

The house was still; Ray still unconscious. She pushed herself off the bed and headed downstairs.

In the kitchen, she moved through the motions of breakfast. A simple plate of eggs and toast, a cup of tea—strong, just as Ray liked it. 

She never touched the stuff, always preferring her coffee. 

She delicately placed his plate down, and left it there, as after three minutes, the plate would wrap itself to keep out the flies and cold.

After, she stepped outside to collect the morning paper that had already formed completely in the mailbox. It was crisp, freshly printed, her address stamped in tiny text at the top. 

She traced a finger over it absentmindedly before unfolding the pages. 

Her eyes flicked first to the war reports, her lips pressing into a thin line as she read.

Her grip on the paper tightened, but she didn't read only the doom and gloom. She read every word, from the major headlines down to the smallest footnotes. 

Reports on local events, like when a crazed drunk man crashed into a shop, scarring the witness so badly they fainted.

When she finished, she folded the paper neatly and set it aside. Then, after much deliberation, she sat by the window, staring out into the grey morning before reaching for her old-fashion cellphone.

A few beeps, then a worn, yet warm voice answered.

""H-hello? Thomason?""

""Hi Mum, how are you?""

""Oh, just wonderful, dearie, yes—yourself?""

Thomason hesitated, fingers tightening around the phone. 
""Yeah, good... um... will you... have you evacuated?""

""Evacuate?"" Martha Joyce scoffed. ""Thomason, love, what have I taught you for a lifetime—one's home is the most important place in one's life. My mother, and her mother before her, stood their ground, and I'm not about to be pushed around a bunch of—""

""There's a war on your doorstep, Mum! Are you really so stubborn you'd stay until—""

""Yes, I would.""

Thomason breath hitched, and she pinched the bridge of her nose.

""Mum, you can't be serious,"" she said, her voice low but tense.

Martha's voice crackled over the line, warm but immovable. ""Thomason, I've never been more certain in my life.""
Thomason paced the kitchen. ""Mum,"" she tried again, her tone firmer now, ""this is not just a scare. It's getting closer. You have to leave.""

A pause. A quiet breath. Then, calm as ever—
""No, I don't.""

Thomason shut her eyes. They stung.

""For God's sake, why?"" she whispered. 

Martha chuckled lightly, like she was discussing the weather. ""I'll be ninety soon, dear. And I've spent all that time on my little farm, in my little house. And if it's time... I'd rather meet it here.""

Thomason's breath caught. Her mouth opened, then shut.
Martha's voice softened. ""I know, dear... I'm sorry, but I've a family tradition to keep.""

Thomason exhaled sharply. She pressed her knuckles against the countertop, grounding herself.

""...I have to go,"" she said. 

""I love you, Thomason. Always have. But... ninety's quite an adventure, isn't it?""

Thomason stayed quiet and took a breath, then hung up.


For a long time, she sat there, the phone still clutched in her hand. 

Then, without another thought, she got up and rushed up the stairs. The bathroom door swung shut behind her.

From downstairs, there then came muffled sounds—Ray leaving the bedroom, and going downstairs—somewhere below, the front door closed with a soft click.

Ray, in a rush, off to his work. She didn't care. She sat there in the quiet, head in her hands, until she and her breath settled.

When at last she emerged, she moved without thought, climbing the stairs to the bedroom. Empty. She sat on the bed, staring at nowhere Ray had laid.

Then, slowly, she lay down.



Ray rushed through the city, weaving between passersby as he flagged down a cab. 

He climbed in, snapped out an address, and the vehicle shot off, weaving through the early morning traffic. 

He barely noticed the blur of buildings passing by—his mind was already on the ASA, on the pulse, on what Ford needed him for.

The moment the cab halted, Ray was out the door, pushing past the entrance of the ASA headquarters. 

He tapped his badge at security, strode to the lift, and rode it straight to the upper floors. 

As he stepped into the main atrium, he adjusted his tie, smoothed his coat, and straightened his posture—just in time to meet Logan's expectant gaze.

""Things have got... very interesting,"" Ford said, leading Ray into the control room.

The space was abuzz with quiet urgency—technicians at their stations, graphs and data streams lining the walls, the faint hum of machinery filling the air. Logan handed Ray a report.

""Last night, Dr. Monroe noted a subtle shift in the pulse's rhythm. 1.460 seconds to 1.40 seconds. Stranger still? By morning, it had returned to its previous state.""

Ray's thoughts ignited, spinning through calculations, possible explanations, implications.

""Aside from that, nothing else has changed,"" Ford continued. ""We still have no clue what we're dealing with. And—ah, that's the spirit,"" he added with a smirk, catching the slight straightening of Ray's back, the spark of intrigue in his eye.

""Indeed I am, sir. Observational of you to notice.""

Ford chuckled, but before he could reply, Dr. Monroe strode in, adjusting his glasses and dusting off his coat. 

""You've told him, yes?"" he asked Ford, who nodded.

Monroe turned to Ray. ""Good, then... suppose that leads me to another matter. Dr. James, have you heard of him? His console was left on, yet he has yet to show up.""

Ray's brow furrowed. James—yes, he remembered him. The scientist who had stared into the light of a monitor when Ray arrived at ASA two days prior. 

Ford and Monroe exchanged a glance before Ford spoke again. ""We'll worry about that later. For now, we have a decision to make.""

He led them to the main conference room, where a few other high-ranking scientists had already gathered. 

Once the doors were shut, Ford's tone grew serious.

""Given the irregularity in the pulse's timing, we cannot rule out an external influence. But if there is something out there—some force, some anomaly—we need more than mere observation. We need direct study.""

Ray's breath caught for a moment. His lips fighting back a smile.

""... We're assembling a team. A small, elite group of our best minds to set off to Origin Point Theta and study it firsthand.""

Ray's chest tightened.

""Dr. Godfrey. You, Monroe, and a select few others will be part of the first mission to study this phenomenon up close.""

A silence hung in the air as the weight of the statement settled over them. Ray exhaled slowly, a grin creeping onto his face. ""All things must yield, correct?""

Ford nodded. ""Exactly.""

The decision was made. The journey to Origin Point Theta was to begin tomorrow.



As the elevator hummed beneath his feet, Ray pinched the bridge of his nose. Ford's plan echoed in his mind. 

Tomorrow. He exhaled sharply. But... could I truly bear to leave Thomason alone? For that long?

Before the thought could settle, a voice shattered his concentration.

""Godfrey! There you are—I've been hunting you down for ages!""

Ray looked up, blinking. Beatrice stood before him, practically vibrating with excitement, hands clasped behind her back like she might start bouncing if she didn't restrain herself.

""I got in."" Her grin was radiant. ""I'm officially an ASA intern!""

Ray arched an eyebrow, feigning scrutiny. ""So... my esteemed reputation remains intact, does it?""

Beatrice gave a cheeky smirk. ""Mostly.""

His gaze narrowed. ""Elaborate.""

""Well, I might have set the photonic spectrometer array's baseline calibration a fraction of a percent off.""

Ray exhaled, shaking his head. ""And they still let you in?""

Beatrice gave an exaggerated sigh. ""What can I say? A smile can do a lot.""

Ray gave her a look. ""An infectious one, more like.""

Beatrice grinned. ""Maybe. But that aside, I'm here now.""

Ray nodded, giving her a firm pat on the back. ""You did well. Welcome aboard.""

For a moment, her excitement filled the space between them. Then, almost imperceptibly, Ray's smile dimmed. He exhaled.

""... Rather off-topic, but I won't be around for long. I leave tomorrow.""

Beatrice's grin faltered. ""What do you mean?""

""I've been assigned to a research mission.""

She tilted her head. ""Ooooh, elaborate.""

Ray hesitated, then relented. ""There's a signal. A pulse. Deep in space. It's been repeating like clockwork... until last night—the rhythm shifted. 1.460 seconds to 1.40. But by morning, it had reverted.""

She chewed her lip. ""And that's... weird?""

Ray's gaze lowered, and his expression dimmed.

""... Right. Obviously,"" she muttered, a faint blush creeping in.

""God help us,"" he murmured, an eyebrow twitching, then continued. ""And that's what we're aiming to figure out. What it is, and what it means.""

Beatrice studied him for a moment. ""And you need to go?""

Ray nodded.

She let out a slow breath before she smiled warmly. ""... Well then. Try not to fall into the abyss, understand?""

Ray chuckled. ""One can never rule out an unexpected anomaly in the void.""

Though just as Beatrice turns, Ray speaks up.
""Beatrice. Are you familiar with a Dr. James?""

Beatrice stops and turns to Ray, her duck face saying it all.

Ray nods, gaze dropping to the floor, his brow furrowing.
""I see... that will be all.""

With that, Beatrice turned on her heel, waved goodbye, and, fixing her new coat, walked deeper into the ASA.",1,1742699948.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

1jhpypj,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/1jhpypj/yes_its_possible/,"Yes, it's possible","

I’m writing here to give some hope to others. For about 15 years, I struggled with severe bulimia. I see posts here that remind me of my past life. I couldn’t work; I binged from morning to night. I went two years without keeping anything down except water. I experienced hypoglycemia multiple times a week and vomited an average of 10 times a day(sometimes up ton 30 times). Vomiting 10 times a day for 15 years adds up to 54,750 times. I thought it would never stop.

Where I live, bulimics aren’t hospitalized unless their BMI is extremely low, which wasn’t my case (since I was still absorbing some calories in the end) but i Do day hospital multiple times.

I had completely lost hope of ever living a somewhat normal life. I had even informed my family that, when medical assistance in dying became available for mental health issues, I would apply for it because I was exhausted from a life spent closer to my toilet than to people. My family had accepted my decision because they saw I had no quality of life (and I had already attempted sd twice).

Then, once again, I asked my doctor for medication. At that point, I was buying ADHD meds from friends because they were the only thing that helped me control myself a little. My doctor finally agreed to prescribe Vyvanse, which is for ADHD but also binge eating disorder. That was my lifeline. No, I don’t have ADHD, but for the first time, I wasn’t experiencing nonstop cravings.

Then I got a dog. I put all my energy and time into him. For months, I would leave home for every meal to get a ""safe"" meal from a restaurant, eat in my car with my dog, take him for a walk, and return home in the evening.

For the first time in my adult life, I managed to go three consecutive days without bingeing and purging. Then four, five, six… fifteen. Even in day hospital, I had never lasted that long. I never thought I could do it. No, I’m not 100% cured. Yes, I still binge and purge sometimes. But I broke free from the cycle where that was all I did every day. Now I eat like everyone else. I still have some unhealthy behaviors, but never as bad as before.

I used to be unable to keep even a coffee down. For months, I ate the exact same thing for lunch and dinner (and even now, that meal is still my ""safe"" choice). But recovery is possible. I no longer have the ""bulimic face."" I don’t have to check if restaurant or friends’ bathrooms are suitable for vomiting. I don’t pull over on the side of the road to throw up.

I’ve done so many shameful things. I think back to vacations I took years ago, and all I remember are the places where I threw up. It was horrible.

I feel deep sadness and compassion for those still trapped in the situation that stole 15 years of my life. I lost my twenties in the pursuit of thinness, only to end up looking sick.

Take care of yourselves. I know how incredibly hard it is to live like this. I’m sending you all a hug and wishing you the strength to break free from this vicious cycle.

It just doesnt taste as good as using water and you'll lose a bunch of expensive cream in the grounds you discard. To adjust for the added water increase the cream and decrease the milk to bulk up the fat. Add a bit of toasted milk powder.

Recently, I was at Baiduri, waiting in line, when I overheard a man mumbling something to his friend. He mentioned that he was a prestige customer and was looking for the coffee machine. However, he was told that the service had been stopped due to *puasa*. He politely thanked the staff and then told his friend, “People who fly with RBA still get served food. Those who are fasting have the right to ask the stewardess to take it away (tapao) because the meal is included in the ticket price. But now, as a prestige customer, my benefits are stripped away during *puasa*. Why can’t I ask for a takeaway coffee if this service is supposed to be part of my prestige status?”

Although he said it jokingly, it struck me.

I’ve been taking a lot of annual leave and flying out recently—each trip lasting just one night. I told myself, *Something is wrong with me.*

Today, I had some work that required me to drive down to Seria. The town was empty. I tried to find something to eat and managed to order some *tapao* at the market, but most of the shops were closed. I wanted a coffee, but then I realized that most of the cafés on that street were also closed—including my favorite one. Suddenly, I felt really down. Depressed, even.

And then I asked myself, *Why am I feeling this way?*

As I drove home, the more depressed I felt, the faster I drove.

Ive been chatting with a guy for past 2 weeks or so. Its been pretty great connection so far and we have few mutual friends in common we found out about as well. He’s 31 yrs old and Im 27 for context. When we first chatted on hinge he kind of made plans of having our first date at an Italian place. We chatted for a bit more and then he asked the day we met to go out for coffee so we made plans and had a nice get to know you 1st date. Few days later was his bday and he mentioned how he would like to see me and possibly go see a new movie that came out but plans changed and he asked me to join a birthday dinner with few of his close friends/there gfs. It was a great night but that was “2nd date” if you call it and he kissed me for the first time. Dropped me off home and asked if I was free the next day and ended up meeting each other the next day evening and I decided to drive to his place (lives at home but as he says “can easily buy a place if he sells some of his cars boats etc”) and we went  to wendy’s and grabbed a frosty/some snacks and sat in the car and talked for hours (nothing happened other then kissing). The last thing he seems is to be a f-boy from what we’ve talked about and seems he just ready to settle down but texting him/these dates we’ve been on have felt a bit unorganized/doesn’t really feel like a date - not to sound like a gold digger one bit. I just want to be treated right but also be able to go out, enjoy a nice dinner, do an activity etc but have him plan it rather than tell him? Even with texting I don’t hear back from him until the evening usually which is fine since he does pretty well off for himself and opening his business so I get being busy but I never know if Im seeing him/whats happening. When we do text though there is so so so much convo happening. Hes also very into cars/winter/summer sports etc and talks about doing that a lot together up north. I guess Im just all a bit confused on how to go about this/how to feel. Again completely okay with coffee dates, movies/car rides but just doesn’t seem like there will be more especially to build up that connection/relationship we both seem to be looking for? Guess Im a bit worried expressing this to him as well and coming off rude/too much.

Genuinely seems were both very into one another (at least I am and he has said so) and the connection we’ve had too but again I do enjoy a nice planned date night here n there rather than waiting on him to reply and being unorganized. He has apologized for the late texts/being unorganized as well and how he’s stressed with his new business. Again completely understandable priorities of work/family etc first since we just met too. Even on the first date I remember saying “Id like to see him again” and he jokingly had said “well def see each other whether you like it or not” and laughed it off and def seen each other 3 times in a week almost!

1jhpqh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1jhpqh9/achievements_and_shortfalls/,Achievements and shortfalls.,"Hey there friends. Today is a day where my emotions are seemingly greater than myself and I am open writing in the attempts to off gas. 

My mind is so full lately, the weight of working two jobs is beginning is noticeable. This level of exhaustion is to be expected though. Today is day thirty of no coffee, and day 15 of no caffeine. My cannabis consumption is at reasonable medicinal use. With these starting steps my health and bank account are going in the direction that's making me smile and have a sense of goal completed. 

Last month was very hard on me. There was so. much. pain. But it was opening my box of cptsd. Yes it was done at a outpatient facility and it was the two weeks. Turns out CBT is not enough. I needed DBT training aswell. 
Tried the big pharma route, but my clinicians and family did not enjoy the who I was. 🫠 that's a fun thing to learn coming out of a medically induced haze. 

Now my big accomplishments.  I climbed a thirty foot ladder at work today. It was a big cotterman work stair so there was all the safety I needed to venture a hight and was up there for two hours fixing a jam. Zero meltdowns, zero crying, and my eyes even looked down at the floor and the hight did not make me puke. 😃 that was Wednesday. 

Last Friday I did go out and had dinner with a close friend at a ""ethnic"" restaurant that was unvetted. It was Ramen so that was a very safe bet. Typically my brain defaults to fear with food. There is more than one person in my family that tampers with food stuffs. So my cpts informed my patterns that food can be tampered with, thus I must observe food not being tampered with.  So before treatment I would wholesale write off a restaurant if the cooks were not visible. 
The Ramen and machi donuts were wonderful and totally want to try more restaurants. 
Thank you Q for being awesome and driving my stoned butt. But doing social events is like a mushroom trip, setting, mood and safety is needed to have a good time. 

I am excited for tomorrow, there is a tower that missed out climbing. There is enough willpower to attempt putting my mind in order to summit that tower. Last time I went it was with a fantastic hiking partner. They did not know about how I got pushed off a roof and why lights weird me out.  They took me through some of their favorite spots that happened to be caves you have to climb into. To their awesome credit they realized something was off when I refused to walk to the cliff edge and I fessed to my fear of heights.  The rest of the day was looking up to see leaves. 🥰  that was one of the best dates. Until the tower.. my hiking partner asked if wanted to ascend three times, all three kind warm and inviting.    But the defender ego was gawning to surface trying to fight back my own emotions then be seen crying in public. The last thing I recall of that trip was the president fire pit, then going home. ""I"" did not decend that trail. 

There is this thing somewhere in me that my clinicians refer to as the defender ego. It's the me who exists when I can't even? But it is a beast that is barbed, spiteful and vitriolic. How is that defence. But to protect me it pushes everything else away. Some where between BPD, or DID.  The Autism and cptsd is really a bastard hydra of a diagnosis. 

Things would be so much easier if I can take the flash drive housing that beast out of my brain and plug in a flash drive with a save file of stardew valley.  To beable to place all of my problems on the beast and cut myself free from it, but that's what I've been doing for years.  This year is to learn to live with Sven. 

Thank you all for winding post. The feelings of a meltdown have been sorted and there's no need for night time joint now. Hopefully you all find some happiness for the weekend.  Try your very best to love your self, and be kind to the to people who care. 🥰",1,1742698751.0,AutisticAdults,0,1.0,False

1jhpo8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1jhpo8l/i_lived_in_a_haunted_apartment_and_im_still/,I lived in a haunted apartment and I’m still recovering,"Putting a trigger warning on here because I talk about using substances/alcohol. 

I've been wanting to tell this story for a while but haven't really known how. Fair warning, this is going to be long, but shortened to the best of my ability. 

 I moved out of this apartment in a frenzy, almost two years ago now. I've had a lot of time to process it but still can't wrap my head around what happened there. I've tried looking up information about it, to see if any deaths ever occurred there, but couldn't find anything. Anyway. 

This was the first apartment I moved into on my own. I split the rent with my younger sister. I didn't notice anything weird with it at first. The rent was cheap. It was an old building and kind of dusty, but it had some new appliances and it was spacious. It even had an extra room which I could use as an art studio. New floors in the kitchen. Nice hardwood in the living room. Good location, it was right up the street from a nice park with a river. Overall, it seemed great. So we signed the lease and moved in the very next day. 

The first night I slept there, I didn't sleep well. Once again, though, nothing weird. I just wasn't used to the noise from the neighbors, and because I was dirt poor I didn't have a bed or curtains or anything, so it was uncomfortable. But normal. 

A few weeks in, I had gotten myself a mattress from Walmart and curtains to block out the street lights. I'd set up my art studio and found some more furniture, either secondhand or from relatives. The place began to feel like a home. That was when weird things started happening. 

First, it was small things that were easy to brush off. My sister said she could hear silverware clinking in the kitchen at night. Then she accused me of messing with her doorknob while she was trying to sleep. We chalked it up to vibrations from cars driving down the street, or the neighbors making noise. These small disturbances continued, but we thought nothing of it. 

I started to have trouble sleeping. I'd wake up several times throughout the night. At the time, I worked early mornings at a coffee shop, so sometimes I'd wake up at 3 or 4 in the morning and just stay up the rest of the night. There was no clear reason why I couldn't sleep. I'd just find myself waking up at odd hours wide awake. Eventually, it took a toll on me, and I started having a nightcap to knock me out each night. Usually just a glass of whiskey, straight. I never drank much before, but for some reason, it seemed like the best thing to do. It worked for a while. 

Meanwhile, my sister was also having trouble sleeping. She'd stay up late playing music too loudly, which caused friction between us. 

More friction: I got tips at my job which I kept in a coffee can in my room. Over time I noticed money missing. We also fought about her drinking my liquor, and then about her spilling alcohol all over the apartment, and then about me waking up in the middle of the night finding my bedroom door wide open and things moved around my room. 

I felt a need to protect myself somehow and leaned heavily into some kind of spirituality. I cleansed the apartment with sage often. I kept certain crystals in my pockets. I started seeing 444 repeatedly. None of this really did anything of course. But I felt a compulsive need to light the sage, to charge the crystals. Now, when I woke up at night, I'd walk down the street to the river and lay the crystals out on the rocks. I'd write 444 on a piece of paper and then burn it with a lighter and throw it in the river. I don't know why I did this. I also went on a lot of long walks to clear my head and get out of the apartment. I felt like the only time I could think clearly was when I wasn't in the building. 

As time went on, both me and my sister drank more and more heavily. There are many nights there that I don't remember. I'd be working in my studio having a glass of whiskey and would wake up in my bed soaked in vomit. The art I made was weird. A lot of gore. Watercolors. There's one of a snake coming out of woman's belly, and another of two women plucking out each other's eyeballs. There's one drawing of my sister that I tore up and made into a collage. The inspiration for these seemed to come in flashes. I'd get really strong visions and had to create them, all the while getting drunk out of my mind. I've tried to create more images in that art style now, but I physically just can't do it. 

I started getting terrible nightmares where I'd wake up sweating and screaming. Really horrific stuff. Some of them were reoccurring. One in particular was of the room next to me, my art studio, on fire. There was a blonde, middle-aged woman I saw a lot in these dreams, and she always looked cross. Not sad or even angry, but just very stern and almost disappointed. 

The whispers started maybe six months in. At night, while I was falling asleep, I'd hear these whispers. Sometimes they'd whisper my name. Often they said ""leave the body. Keep the body. Leave the body"" over and over again like that. 

Through all of this, I continued to see 444 a lot and tried to do yoga and meditate during the day. Here was the only time I had an out-of-body experience when meditating. I felt my whole body vibrating, and felt a pop? And then I felt like i was floating around the apartment and could float through it and see everything. My sister came into my room while this was happening and tried to talk to me but I couldn't respond to her. It felt like only a few minutes but when I came out of it I saw that over an hour had passed. 

Bad stuff happened in this apartment. My sister invited a boy over who she hooked up with and started dating, who eventually turned out to be very abusive to her. Other people she invited over always seemed to start these big, awful arguments. One of these people broke the window to the front door. We had to call the police a few times because people got violent. I invited my best friend over one night. I never had romantic feelings for her, but for some reason, she and I hooked up, started dating, and things ended between us very badly. But before we broke up, I spent days at a time at her place. Whenever I returned to the apartment I felt terrible, sick, and my skin felt itchy almost like I was allergic to it. I also felt inexplicably on edge and irritated. I took allergy medicine for a while thinking I had a dust allergy, but it didn't help anything. The only thing that helped was not being there, and not sleeping there. It got to the point where I was afraid to go to sleep at night because of the whispers and the nightmares. The drinking certainly didn't help things, but when I was there, all I wanted to do was drink and dissociate as much as possible. 

I struggled with depression, and it got very bad during this time. After my ex and I broke up, I couldn't stand to stay in that apartment any longer, so I left, and moved 40 minutes away to a new town. I sleep soundly in my new place. But that old apartment shifted something in me. I started getting flashbacks from something traumatic that happened to me as a child, and I checked myself into a hospital and stayed there ten days. 

----

I know this is long and weird, but there's more to add. I have two other siblings aside from the one I shared the apartment with, and they all lived there at one point or another. Each one of them started using alcohol or other substances heavily, and each one reported feeling a sense of unease there. Basically, staying there made us all crash out. I can't help but feel like something paranormal was at play. 

Now, we are all moved out of there for good. I don't drink often anymore, but when I do, I don't drink whiskey. I have the same crystals I used while I was there, and still consider myself spiritual, but not nearly as fanatic about it as I was then. All of us are much more stable now. My depression is under control and I don't have many nightmares or flashbacks. I am still recovering from all the money I lost there, either from buying alcohol or my sister stealing from me or from not ever getting my double security deposit back...

I am, however, writing this because last night I dreamt about those awful whispers, and woke myself up screaming.
I am here in my ""new"" place and I feel safe, but god... I never want to experience anything like that ever again. I felt like a different version of myself then, something I never want to see again for as long as I live. Like I said, some of it I don't even remember very well. There was something very, very wrong about that place. But somehow I feel a weird sort of attachment to it, like a toxic relationship or something. It's bizarre.

I still don't know if it was my mental illness or something else. I will say that as soon as we all moved out, new tenants moved in, but the place went back up for rent just a few months later. All I can say is good luck to whoever moves in there next. That place is cursed.

I am not into really floral or fruity coffees in general, and want something to contrast to the 078 (wehich I do like).

EXT. PANAJI STREETS – NIGHT



The city hums in the dark—streetlights flicker, waves lap against the shore. A humid breeze rustles the palm fronds. Goa never truly sleeps.



A scooter glides through the quiet streets, its headlight carving a narrow path. Devkar rides, his hands steady on the handlebars. His eyes flick between the road and the shadows beyond it.



His voice, calm and measured, fills the night.



DEVKAR (V.O.)



""Tonight’s the night.""



He weaves through narrow lanes, passing old Portuguese villas, their balconies draped in bougainvillea. A dog watches him from a stoop, unblinking.



DEVKAR (V.O.)



""And it’s going to happen again. And again.""



He turns onto a deserted stretch along the Sal River, streetlights reflecting in the slow-moving water. A few fishing boats bob in the distance.



DEVKAR (V.O.)



""This is what I am. This is what I do.""



He slows the scooter near a small, weathered house. The sound of a scooter engine idling can be heard nearby. Another scooter—parked just inside the gate.



Devkar watches.



The front door opens, and a man steps out. DOMNIC D’SOUZA—mid-50s, thin, always smiling. He hums a Konkani hymn, locking the gate behind him.



DEVKAR (V.O.)



""Predators don’t hunt in the jungle. They hunt no one  suspects ... where trust runs deep ... where no one is watching.""



Beat.



""Except me.""



Domnic mounts his scooter. The engine purrs to life. Devkar’s eyes flick to the license plate—burning it into memory.



As Domnic rides away, Devkar follows, his own scooter purring in the night, shadowing him like a ghost.



\---

EXT. NARROW GOAN ROAD – NIGHT



Devkar follows Domnic’s scooter at a careful distance, his headlight dimmed just enough to blend into the night. The road curves along the river, the water shimmering under the moonlight.



Domnic rides slow, unbothered, a man with nothing to fear.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""They trust him. The church treasurer. The helpful uncle. The kind neighbor. A man of faith, they say.""



The scooter wobbles slightly as Domnic scratches his chin. He adjusts his rearview mirror but never looks back.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""They don’t see what I see.""



Devkar’s grip on the handlebars tightens.



\---



EXT. DOMNIC’S HOUSE – NIGHT



A single-story home with cracked white paint. A wooden cross hangs above the door, the metal dull with age. Domnic pulls into the driveway, humming to himself.



Devkar is already inside.



The room is neat. Too neat. The kind of careful organization that hides secrets. The faint scent of saline lingers in the air.



Domnic doesn’t notice.



He locks the door. Kicks off his shoes. He hums a little louder now, the same hymn, comforted by routine.



Then—he stops.



he hears something behind him and barely turns before—snap—the attack happens.



DEVKAR (O.S.)  

""Hello domnic"" 



Domnic turns.



A beat.



Domnic’s breath quickens. The hymn he was humming—now trapped in his throat.



The sound of duct tape tearing.



\---



INT. DOMNIC’S HOUSE – LATER



Domnic is tied to a rusted chair, his wrists bound tight. He thrashes weakly. The Sal leaf envelope is now stuffed into his mouth, sealed shut with tape.



Devkar stands over him, calm. Surgical. Efficient.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""I don’t believe in God. Or sin. Or redemption.



""Nature doesn’t forgive.""



""It only corrects.""



A gloved hand. A thin scalpel. The first cut.



Blood pools. A single drop falls into a tiny glass vial.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""And I am nature’s hand.""



A moment of stillness.



Then—darkness.



\---



INT. DEVKAR’S FLAT – MORNING



Sunlight creeps through the slatted window. A slow, golden invasion.



Devkar stands in front of his bathroom mirror, dragging a razor down his jaw with clinical precision. His face is blank. Unreadable.



The walls are bare except for a shelf lined with pinned insects—catalogued, labeled, arranged. A quiet obsession.



Outside, the city stirs. The smell of chai and warm bread drifts through the air. A distant a regional song plays on a radio.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""By day, I am invisible.A quiet presence, unnoticed, unremarkable ""



He pulls on his Goa Forensics Bureau ID badge. Another mask. Another role.



""The living walk past me without ever seeing.""



He pockets his keys. Leaves the flat.



The streets are alive now. Fishermen haul in their morning catch. Tourists fumble with maps. A group of boys laugh over cups of cutting chai.



Devkar walks through them all, unseen.



\---



INT. GOA FORENSICS BUREAU – MORNING



The hum of the lab. Glass beakers clinking. A centrifuge whirring.



Devkar moves through it with practiced ease, checking slides under a microscope, cataloging insect larvae.



Carlos D’Cruz leans against the counter, watching.



CARLOS  

""You ever think maybe you work too hard, man? Always in here with your bugs, your crime scenes, your… whatever this is.""



He gestures at the microscope. Devkar tilts his head slightly, as if considering it.



DEVKAR  

""It’s my job.""



Carlos laughs.



CARLOS  

""No, it’s an obsession.""



He leans in conspiratorially.



CARLOS  

""You know what you need? Some La Passion.""



Devkar blinks, processing.



DEVKAR  

""La Passion?""



CARLOS  

""yes. My friend in Miami swears by it. Says that’s the secret to life—La Passion. Find what sets your soul on fire... we met on facebook a few months ago""



He gestures dramatically, as if revealing the meaning of life. Devkar watches, impassive.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""friend from miami ? Carlos intrigues me sometimes.""



Carlos slaps the table.



CARLOS  

""You? You got no La Passion, man. You need something outside of work. Go out, drink, meet someone. You ever just… live?""



Devkar fakes a small, polite smile.



DEVKAR  

""I live.""



Carlos laughs.



CARLOS  

""No Devkar You.... just exist.""



He points at Devkar’s microscope.



CARLOS  

""That? That’s not life. That’s… staring at dead things.""



Devkar lowers his gaze, adjusting a slide.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""He’s right. I stare at the dead. I understand them. Because I am one of them.""



Carlos sighs, clapping Devkar on the back.



CARLOS  

""Alright, suit yourself. But one day, you’re gonna wake up and realize you need more than bugs and bodies.""



He starts to walk off when Devkar speaks.



DEVKAR  

""Acutally.. I have a date with Aisha tonight.""



Carlos stops, turning back with a raised eyebrow.



CARLOS  

""You? A date?""



DEVKAR  

""That’s the plan.""



Carlos nods, taking another sip of his coffee.



CARLOS  

""Alright. But don't forget La passion.""



He walks off, shaking his head. Devkar watches him go, his polite smile fading instantly.



DEVKAR (V.O.)

""Some men chase fire. Others keep it contained.""



His eyes drift to the crime scene board—fingers wrapped in red thread. The Aguada Ripper.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""But not everyone does.""



\---

INT. GOA POLICE BUREAU – FORENSIC LAB – NIGHT



The room is dimly lit, bathed in the glow of computer monitors. The faint hum of the A/C and the distant chatter of officers create a quiet backdrop.



Devkar sits at his desk, fingers tapping idly against the keyboard. The screen in front of him displays case files. His expression is unreadable.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

The world has rules. Laws. They are supposed to keep the worst of us in check. But what happens when the worst of us know how to slip through the cracks?



He leans forward, typing in a name:



ROHAN KAMAT



A mugshot appears. A grinning man, tattooed hand, a scar cutting across his brow. Gang leader. Drug trafficking. Extortion.



And homicide.



Four counts. Two witnesses disappeared before trial. The case was thrown out.



Devkar’s jaw tightens. His eyes flick over the records. Police reports. Photos of bodies found gutted in a warehouse. The kind of butchery that doesn’t come from necessity, but from pleasure.



He tilts his head slightly.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

Not all predators are the same. Some kill for control. Some kill for power. And then, there are those like me.



He opens another tab—a surveillance report.



Kamat’s last known location: A private villa in Anjuna. A fortress. Well-guarded. But not impossible.



Devkar’s fingers hover over the keyboard. Calculating.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

The Code is simple. He preys on the innocent. He walks free. That means he belongs to me.



A faint smirk tugs at his lips as he clicks the monitor off.



He has everything he needs.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

Tomorrow, I begin.



\---



INT. GOA FORENSICS BUREAU – LATE AFTERNOON



The crime lab buzzes with low conversation and faint music playing from someone’s phone. The faint smell of disinfectant and coffee lingers.



Devkar is at his station, methodically labeling a sample vial when the Lieutenant steps in.



INTRODUCING THE LIEUTENANT



The Lieutenant—Madhav Naik, mid-50s, composed, sharp-eyed—walks in holding a case file. His presence commands attention.



MADHAV  

""Devkar, you got a minute?""



Devkar straightens, nodding.



MADHAV  

""We’ve got another body near the Sal River. Need you there first thing tomorrow. Some fresh samples might still be viable.""



Devkar already knows the case. The Aguada Ripper.



DEVKAR  

""I’ll be there.""



Madhav narrows his eyes.



MADHAV  

""You’re leaving early today?""



DEVKAR  

""Yes.""



A pause.



MADHAV  

""Taking a day off? That’s new.""



Devkar doesn’t react. Madhav studies him a moment longer, then nods.



MADHAV  

""Hell must’ve frozen over. You, taking a personal day?""



He walks off, flipping through the case file.



\---



INT. FORENSICS BUREAU – BREAK ROOM



INTRODUCING DEVKAR’S SISTER



Devkar pours himself a cup of black coffee, only to have a slim brown hand swipe the mug away.



SAMEERA DEVKAR, mid-30s, bold, sarcastic, his older sister. She takes a sip of his coffee, unimpressed.



SAMEERA  

""Still drinking this garbage?""



Devkar watches her with mild disinterest.



DEVKAR  

""You didn’t have to steal it to find out.""



Sameera smirks, leaning on the counter.



SAMEERA  

""You never take time off. So… what’s her name?""



Devkar doesn’t blink.



DEVKAR  

""Who?""



SAMEERA  

""The reason you’re leaving before sunset.""



Devkar stares. Sameera grins, nudging his arm.



SAMEERA  

""Since when do you take personal days? Secret girlfriend?""



DEVKAR  

""I have things to do.""



Sameera hums, unconvinced.



SAMEERA  

""Sure. 'Things.'""



She sips the rest of his coffee, then walks off with a knowing smile.



\---



INT. FORENSICS LAB – DEVKAR’S WORKSTATION



INTRODUCING OUR VERSION OF MASUKA



At his desk, Anay Borkar—early 40s, loud, flirtatious, always joking—leans back in his chair, scrolling through his phone.



ANAY  

""Hey, bro. You ever see a crab with two heads?""



Devkar ignores him.



ANAY  

""No, seriously, look at this. Science is wild, man.""



Devkar looks just enough to register it. A mildly disturbing picture of a deformed crab. He nods once.



DEVKAR  

""Interesting.""



ANAY  

""That’s it? No 'holy shit, Anay, that’s insane'?""



DEVKAR  

""I need you to cover for me.""



Anay raises an eyebrow.



ANAY  

""You? Skipping work? Should I be worried?""



DEVKAR  

""Only if you say no.""



Anay grins, dramatically tipping an imaginary hat.



ANAY  

""Anything for my dear, mysterious friend. But you owe me one. I want first dibs on the next weird corpse.""



Devkar doesn’t humor him with a response.



\---



INT. FORENSICS LAB – HALLWAY



As Devkar heads toward the exit, he almost collides with Sub-Inspector Adil Patil, mid-40s, intense, skeptical—their version of Doakes.



ADIL  

""Where are you going, Devkar?""



Devkar stops.



DEVKAR  

""Home.""



Adil doesn’t believe that for a second.



ADIL  

""Funny. There’s a fresh case, and you’re skipping out early?""



DEVKAR  

""I’ll be there in the morning.""



Adil studies him. His gaze hard, sharp.



ADIL  

""You’re always around dead bodies, Devkar. But every time I see you walk out of here, you look like you don’t have a life at all.""



Devkar doesn’t flinch.



DEVKAR  

""That’s because I don’t.""



Adil watches him go.



A long, lingering stare.



\---



EXT. STREETS OF PANJIM – EVENING



Devkar’s scooter weaves through narrow streets, passing old churches, neon-lit taverns, and shadowed alleyways.



His face remains neutral. Detached.



But something about the evening unnerves him.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""Carlos tells me I should live. Sameera thinks I already am. Adil believes I have no life at all.""



""They’re all wrong.""



He stops at a red light. Watches couples walking together, laughing, holding hands.



A strange thought flickers.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""And maybe… they’re right.""



The light turns green. Devkar rides forward.



To Aisha.



\---



EXT. CAFÉ TERRACE – EVENING



A quiet café along the Road. The warm glow of string lights. The murmur of the Cricket T20 match  in the background.



Aisha sits at an  table, absentmindedly stirring her tea. Her purple glasses catch the dim light as she glances at her phone.



Across the street, Devkar parks his scooter.



He takes a breath. Adjusts his sleeves. Steps inside.



\---



INT. CAFÉ – CONTINUOUS



Aisha looks up as Devkar approaches. Her face softens into a small, knowing smile.



AISHA  

""Let me guess. You forgot about our date ?""



Devkar nods once.



DEVKAR  

""No. Its just work. ""



He pulls out the chair across from her. He notices the untouched plate of something sweet in front of her.



DEVKAR  

""You ordered bebinca.""



AISHA  

""I thought you might like it.""



She gestures at it.



AISHA  

""Or, you know… at least pretend to.""



Devkar picks up the fork. Takes a measured bite.



Chews. Swallows.



DEVKAR  

""It’s good.""



Aisha leans in slightly, amused.



AISHA  

""Is it?""



Devkar considers. Honesty tugs at him.



DEVKAR  

""I don’t really know.""



Aisha chuckles.



AISHA  

""Still bad at lying, I see.""



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""She sees through me. That should make me uneasy.""



""But it doesn’t.""



He sets the fork down. Her presence is… different.



\---

INT. CAFÉ – CONTINUOUS



Aisha studies Devkar for a beat, eyes searching.



AISHA  

""You don’t have to do that, you know.""



Devkar tilts his head slightly.



DEVKAR  

""Do what?""



AISHA  

""Pretend.""



She rests her chin on one hand, tapping her fingers lightly against her cheek.



AISHA  

""You could’ve just said you don’t like sweets.""



Devkar considers this. Most people don’t offer him that kind of leeway. They expect politeness. He gives it to them.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""She doesn’t ask for the mask. Just me. Whatever that is.""



He shifts slightly in his seat, fingers tapping against the table.



DEVKAR  

""You ordered it for me.""



AISHA  

""I ordered it because I like it. And I hoped you'd share it.""



She nudges the plate toward him again, a small gesture, but there’s warmth in it. Devkar doesn’t understand warmth, but he recognizes something intentional about it.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""People bond over things like this. Small gestures. Shared moments. I study them, but she… she just does them.""



He glances at her hands—no rings, but faint indentations where one used to be.



DEVKAR  

""How are the kids?""



Aisha smiles, tired but genuine.



AISHA  

""Neel won his cricket match. Tara’s obsessed with painting now. Keeps stealing my dupattas to use as smocks.""



Devkar nods slightly. He doesn’t fully understand why she tells him these things, but he listens.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""She has a life. Full. Complicated. Messy. And yet, she’s here.""



She leans back, crossing her arms.



AISHA  

""And you? You ever think about taking a break? Maybe… existing outside of dead bodies and insect larvae?""



Devkar lets out the smallest exhale—not quite a laugh, but close.



DEVKAR  

""According to Carlos, I don’t even exist properly.""



Aisha chuckles.



AISHA  

""He’s not wrong.""



She watches him, expression softening.



AISHA  

""I don’t know how you do it. The things you see. The weight of it.""



She pauses, as if choosing her next words carefully.



AISHA  

""It doesn’t… stay with you?""



It does. Just not in the way she thinks.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""She carries grief like a scar. Visible. Felt. She lets it shape her, but not define her.""



""I carry mine differently.""



He lifts his cup, stirs the tea, watching the liquid swirl.



DEVKAR  

""It stays.""



Aisha doesn’t press.



Instead, she reaches for her own cup. A quiet understanding passes between them.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""Pain doesn’t connect people. Not really. But survival does.""



""She chose to keep living. To raise her children. To be kind. To love.""



""I didn’t choose anything. I just… am.""



Aisha smiles softly.



AISHA  

""You should let yourself enjoy something once in a while.""



Devkar holds her gaze.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""I do.""



""It’s just not what you’d expect.""



His phone buzzes on the table. He glances at it.



NEW CRIME SCENE.



Aisha sees the look in his eyes and already knows.



AISHA  

""Go.""



No frustration. No expectation. Just understanding.



Devkar hesitates—an unfamiliar feeling. Then, he nods.



He stands, pauses for just a second, then walks away.



Aisha watches him , then turns back to her tea, stirring absentmindedly.



as he is slipping his phone into his pocket. Aisha watches him with raised eyebrows.



AISHA  

""You’re just gonna leave me here, huh?""



Devkar pauses, confused.



DEVKAR  

""You told me to go.""



Aisha sighs, shaking her head with exaggerated disappointment.



AISHA  

""Men. So literal.""



She leans forward, eyes glinting.



AISHA  

""At least pay for my tea, forensic expert. Consider it a tax for abandoning me mid-sip.""



Devkar tilts his head.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""An arbitrary request. Money doesn’t matter. But she expects this—a normal exchange. A balance maintained.""



He pulls out his wallet and drops a few notes on the table. Aisha smirks.



AISHA  

""And for emotional damages?""



Devkar considers her for a moment, then pushes an extra bill toward her.



DEVKAR  

""That should cover it.""



Aisha laughs, shaking her head.



AISHA  

""Unbelievable.""



Devkar almost smiles, then turns to leave.



AISHA (calling after him)  

""And next time, i choose the place and no phone calls!!""



Devkar

""I'll try my best ""



He lifts a hand in acknowledgment without looking back.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""She thinks there will be a next time.""



""Strangely, I don’t disagree.""

Scene: The Crime Scene & The Ritual Reveal



EXT. CRIME SCENE – ABANDONED FISHING SHED – NIGHT



A line of police tape flutters under the dim glow of floodlights. The air is thick with salt and decay, the faint scent of the tide mixing with something far more pungent.



DEVKAR steps past uniformed officers, his face an unreadable mask of focus. The forensic team is already at work—flashes of cameras, muted chatter, and the low hum of radio static filling the air.



A body lies on the damp wooden floor, posed with eerie precision.



Devkar pulls on latex gloves, adjusting them with a quiet snap.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""Routine. This is routine. Observe. Examine. Identify.""



He crouches, penlight in hand, scanning the corpse with meticulous attention. His fingers hover just above the victim’s skin—feeling for bruising, noting every laceration. but none was there. The body was clean



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""A story written in blood . The lividity, the stiffness, the scent of decay—time passed, pain endured.""



He moves the light to the neck.



Pauses.



The cut is precise.



Too precise.



His expression doesn’t change, but something in his gaze sharpens.



His fingers trace the wound with careful detachment.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""No hesitation. A practiced hand.""



His light moves higher.



Behind the left ear—



A thin incision, just like—



His jaw tightens.



His breath slows.



The latex of his gloves creaks slightly as his grip stiffens.



Then—



A flash of ink beneath the sleeve.



A gang tattoo.



Familiar.



Recognizable.



DEVKAR (V.O.)  

""Wait.""



The pieces click.



His mark.



His intended kill.



IT WAS ROHAN KAMAT



But someone else got to him first.



He leans back slightly, controlling his reaction, but his mind spirals.



CUT TO—



\---



FLASHBACK – THE RITUAL (DEVKAR’S METHOD, REVEALED THROUGH PRESENT-DAY VOICEOVER)



INT. ABANDONED HOUSE – NIGHT (WEEKS EARLIER)



A dim, flickering bulb casts jagged shadows against cracked walls. A plastic sheet stretches across the floor.



DOMNIC sits bound, his breath ragged, his eyes darting toward the scalpel in Devkar’s gloved hands.



DEVKAR (V.O., PRESENT DAY)  

""A single cut, just behind the ear. The blade slides clean through the skin. No struggle. No wasted movement.""



A sharp slice.



Domnic flinches, blood welling up immediately.



DEVKAR (V.O., PRESENT DAY)  

""The blood flows smooth, warm. It tells me the heart is still pumping. I have time.""



A gloved hand tilts Domnic’s head, exposing the throat.



The hunting knife glints.



Domnic tenses.



DEVKAR (V.O., PRESENT DAY)  

""A second incision. Precise. Controlled. Just deep enough.""



With one swift motion, the blade glides across Domnic’s throat.



Blood spills onto the plastic in a silent wave.



Devkar watches the life fade from Domnic’s eyes.



No hesitation.



No emotion.



He steps back, watching the body sag, lifeless.



DEVKAR (V.O., PRESENT DAY)  

""Then comes the real work.""



CUT TO—



\---



BACK TO THE CRIME SCENE – PRESENT DAY



Devkar exhales slowly, schooling his expression back to normal. His fingers linger over the incision behind the victim’s ear.



It’s identical.



His light moves back down to the gang tattoo.



His victim.



His intended kill.



But this wasn’t his work.



Someone else did this.



Someone who knew.



And they did it exactly like him.



A presence looms behind him—



ADIL (OUR VERSION OF DOAKES)  

""Why the hell you looking at that body like you wanna marry it?""



Devkar blinks. The mask snaps back into place.



DEVKAR (calm, controlled)  

""Just doing my job.""



Adil squints, his usual skepticism sharpening into something colder.



ADIL (low, skeptical)  

""Nah, man. I’ve seen that look before. You’re enjoying this way too much, you psycho.""



Devkar forces a neutral expression. But inside—



Everything is unraveling.



DEVKAR (V.O.)

""Someone else did this. Someone who knows. Someone watching.""



And for the first time in years—



He doesn’t feel in control.

Half-Asian, half-European, and currently figuring out life in a new city. Most of my friends and family live in different time zones, so I often have no one to talk to online. The friends I do have here? Either busy or they're super bad at replying.

I’m looking for a chill male friend because I have, like, zero in my life! For a change. Just someone chill who loves random convos, jokes, and lighthearted banter. Life updates would be great too! Not looking for deep philosophical debates or political arguments. Also, I'm not expecting real-time convos (I’m not that clingy or annoying 😂) but if you do have time to chat in real-time, even better!

Me in a nutshell: INTJ, into way too many things to ever be bored. I love animals, traveling, rollerskating, learning languages, coffee, Japanese food, reading visual novels, and curating Spotify playlists. Oh, and I work in digital marketing.

If you wanna be friends, just send a DM. Just don’t be demanding please—I might be online now but could randomly pass out in the next minute (it's 3am where I live lol). You know, like a normal human being. But I will reply when I can. ✨",0,1742698053.0,r4r,1,0.33,False
1jhphkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1jhphkn/boundaries_re_silent_treatmentignoring_by_mil_in/,Boundaries re: silent treatment/ignoring by MIL in person,"Married 14 years, lots of kids.  My (f, 42)family is all on the other side of the country, and I get along with my husband's (m, 41) entire extended family except MIL.

I'm comfortable with boundaries.  Given my MILs personality, I treat everything like some miscommunication that we're just clearing up.  She does cross boundaries knowingly, but I purposefully tried to take the most generous view. Im not perfect. I don't like her. She pretended to think I'm GREAT!!! She just ADORES me, but that is not the case.  She wears every judgemental thought on her face, but since she doesn't say it, or says passive-aggressive things, just shy of crossing a line.

I got over them not liking me years ago when we had a big to-do about some parenting choices we made for our daughter (basically,  she is allowed to have opinions). It wasn't pretty, and I dramatically reduced any time they were alone with the kids to near zero.  That was 6 years ago.  They don't like me in don't really like them but we all pretend well enough and it felt like we'd found a mutual respect.   We found a groove.  We saw them for all holidays and every 6 weeks or so between. 

MIL also holds grudges and at any given time is on the outs with most of her family.  She hates most of her neighbors,  has no friends and has removed herself from most every book club and civic organization in town because of other people.  It's always other people.  I've never understood how he couldnt see it, but DH has always seen her as the victim in whatever scenario was presented.  

MIL has a sister that I've grown close to over the years.  She is a former math professor and I recently returned to work as a math teacher after being home with the kids for years.  We have a lot in common and have been texting/meeting up occasionally for years.  I also have soild relationships with my FILs sisters and SILs.  This has never been a problem.

Until my MIL got into it with her sister over some stuff related to their mother's care, and  my MIL decided not to go to the family Christmas party (dec 2023).  She told my husband and asked us not to go.  We have the only kids in that family, and we only see these people once a year, including my DHs 90yo grandma.  I told him no, we were going.    He said that we should just give it to her (not going), but i was firm.  We went.  She acted ok on Christmas day but then sent him a mean text about how he betrayed her.  

He pretended it didn't happen. Apparently, that is how his family handles things.  She knce told me that if she decided she was done with someone, that would be it, forever.  Also that she never ever talks about issues. 6 weeks go by, and we attend a family baby shower.  She is normal with him but is super rude to me.  She would not respond when I spoke to her and instead would turn to the person next to her and answer to them, like they had asked.  It was odd but subtle enough that it could have been just in my head. 

I texted her after to say ""hey, can we meet up.  It seems like you are mad at me, you were rude at the baby shower.  I'd like to talk and straighten things out.  Our relationship is important to me""  she left me in read for a week then said something along the lines of ""nothing is wrong, I think you're wonderful!!!""  

Seriously.  She wrote that.  I said that I was pretty sure something was up and really wanted to grt coffee or something to put us back on track.  She proceeded to go through 2 months of leaving me on read or having random excuses that were clearly BS to avoid talking to me. My husband finally called his dad and she admitted it to his dad (DH heard her admit it) that she had been very rude go me and was avoiding me. She also said that talking about it with me would be like peeling the skin off her face.  Pretty strong words.  All the while texting me that she had nooooooo idea what I was talking about and that she was also just so busy that she couldn't see me at all...ever.

At this point it was May and she sent me a birthday card with 5times the gift she usually sends. It felt like a bribe.  So I donated it to the food bank and texted a thank you, that was so generous but km not comfortable taking gifts from you given that you said talking to me would be like peeling skin off your face and you are actively avoiding me.  Please do not send more gifts or, if you wish, make a donation in my name to any charity of your choice.  Thank you.

After that, she and father in law both started to ignore me. Pointedly.   At our children's spring concerts and events, littleraly walking away when I spoke to them.  Refusing to stand near me.  Leaving events to sit in the car when I showed up.  At large family parties, small gatherings, every time.

By August my brother came to visit and we took him to a large family get together where they were warm to him and pretended I wasn't there standing right next to him.  Ignored me when I spoke.  My brother was like...this isn't you.  Why are you acting like this is ok?  It was a wake up call.  I had somehow allowed this to happen while trying to diffuse the situation.

We got back from that party and I went off on DH, but he was like this stuff was normal to him.  That's how his mom is with people.  It took having an outsider say exactly what they were seeing for me to remember my worth and for my DH to wake up.  

DH told his dad that they could treat me with respect or there were not going to be visits. MIL refused to change and instead asked DH to meet her.  She gave him a 10pg letter explaining all the ways I have hurt her over the years.  She did not let him keep The letter but he told me that it was just a long list of my boundaries.  Things like the time we asked her to stop giving one of our kids a specific yogurt because it caused her to have diarrhea.  Or when we asked her to go easy on Christmas the year after we had to make two trips witb our minivan because it did not fit.  That she has to call 1st and that i don't let her come over on week days unless DH is home (she was coming all day every day).  Basically that my boundaries are because I'm a control freak and she didnt have any boundaries with her MIL.  

We did not see them for Thanksgiving or Christmas day, just at an extended family holiday party where they continued to ignore me.  I don't care about gifts, but they have stopped sending the kids birthday gifts and did not give them Christmas gifts but gave every other child at that party a gift.  Every kid but their own grandkids.

My MIL has had a few calls with my husband where she had begged him to being the kids up but I'm not allowed.  He declines, of course, but only because I said it was a deal breaker if he did. 

I have told him and he has told them, I'm not looking for an apology.  I know it won't be real and I don't think it would be helpful.  I don't want to pretend it hasn't happened, but I do expect basic courtesy.   Don't act like I dont exist.  That's it. Not in a ""i don't deserve better"" way, but in a pragmatic way.  If they can do that then we can start seeing them a bit and trying to rebuild some semblance of a relationship.  Not trust, I'll never trust them, but something for the kids. I am ok being uncomfortable sometimes for my husband to have a relationship with his parents.  For my kids to have a relationship with their grandparents.  Not nearly to the degree it was before.  But I can deal with uncomfortable for, say 2 hours a few times a year. That's what I can give.  They just have to treat me with basic dignity.  That is the line.  We have not seen them since.

Now to the advice part.  His grandmother is not doing well.  My MILs family, consisting of her sister that she doesn't talk to (but is supportive of me) a brother she is ok with but doesn't talk to his wife and my DH and Kids as well as FIL are supposed to get together at my grandma in laws nursing home.  This visit isn't about me.  I'm prepared to deal with it for 2 hours for DH to be with grandma in law and his family plus our kids (only great grandkids).  

The line is basic respect, but what does that look like?  What if she is rude right in front of my kids?  My older ones already know what is going on, it had to be explained because it was obvious (appropriately and without dragging them in, MIL is having trouble with boundaries we're giving compassion and space while she deals with her feelings ect). But at what point am I making this about me?  

She called my husband today to confirm location and time and was all chit chatty and he spoke to her like nothing was happening and I just felt so abandoned but I'm trying to let him have his relationship and not make this about me when his grandma is not doing well.  

What about next time?  The next event that isn't a clear family goodbye.  What are the lines? She's really good at being jussssstttttt under the line.  But im.also unsure of what that is, the line is mean. I'm not interested in making anyone pretend to like me, or have fake conversations.  I just want to be the basic polite you are with a stranger at a grocery store.  

My kids range from 6 to 18.  I don't want to model being a doormat OR estranging them from their grandmother without good reason.  Do I just say ""I don't keep company with those that are disrespectful of me, I'm going to leave and when I go my kids come too""  something like that?  

Practical advice please.   My husband has been very supportive since my brother talked to him last august, but coming out of enmeshment is hard and he has been fielding weekly guilt trip calls and near daily texts about how awful I am for months from his parents. His default is no conflict.  So when he is caught off guard, like he was with her call today, he goes all pleasant.  That is my fear for in person stuff.  Planned calls he is strong and sticks to his points, but in person he melts in the face of her tears.

I don't know how y'all feel, but for me it's been the absolute opposite.

As a TBM Molly Mormon, when I found I had a condition that meant I could never be a Mommy, I was devastated. I wasn't sure if I was being punished or tested. I thought I'd never find a husband as who would want someone who couldn't give them their forever family?

Now, as strange as it sounds, as a non-believer I can not only accept it but see the positives. I inherited a faulty chromosome from my Mom. Nobody's fault. No womb means no unplanned pregnancy, and it means no periods. The condition also means the sort of rack people pay 0000s for, a high sex drive, sweat that doesn't smell bad and a tight but firm vagina.

I know for a fact, had I still been a TBM dealing with cancer would have been a lot harder. As a non-believer I knew it was purely bad luck. A cell fucked up while dividing. Nobody was to blame, I was neither being tested nor punished, and if it had turned out to be terminal, and if death is really the end, well, wouldn't be much different to sleeping and I abaolutely love a lie in.

And the strict but silly rules we lived by? I'd have had to quickly marry my ex so we could satisfy our urges. Turned out he was a douchebag. If I'd had to stay married to the first guy I banged, life would be so shit.

These attacks would radiate 8/10 pain up my esophagus/chest, and up my left back, for hours. I did the acid watcher diet for 2+ months, and the attacks came right back when eating previously safe non-AWD foods. So I said screw it i need to find the root cause.

I read about the link to caffeine and loosening the lower esophageal sphincter - and i started to realize that my GERD only started to progress as I became a daily coffee drinker at 18. I was only having one cup a day - briefly got addicted to two cups a day a couple years back, but swore never to introduce any more caffeine. Super sensitive to caffeine, literally a barqs root beer (~30mg caffeine) would be enough to give me a headache if i didnt have it again the next day. 

Decided to go on the slowest wean possible off my one cup a day, which was replacing 0.1g of regular coffee with decaf coffee each day. I spent a night pre-measuring out everything so all i had to do was crack open the disposable condiment cup for the day of mixed reg/decaf coffee in the morning, and pour it into my reusable k-cup. The total days weaning off of coffee were 93 (it takes 9.3g to fill my k-cup). I started in late december. 

By the time I got through mid february, past the halfway point in my wean, my GERD attacks had basically disappeared. It only got better in march - I was eating ALL of my trigger foods again (pasta with tomato sauce, tacos with hot sauce, spicy ANYTHING, etc) and being able to lay down right after without acid in my esophagus was nothing short of A MIRACLE. 

Today I crossed the last day of my wean. I had ~1mg of caffeine yesterday, 0mg today. I had pasta earlier after my workout with tomato sauce and took yet another fat ass cat nap on my futon. Once again, no acid reflux. 

If you've tried a bunch of stuff and you're not getting any results, seriously look into eliminating ANY caffeine (teas, pills, sodas ANYTHING) from your diet. This literally changed my life. My LES clearly is working again and my tummy is absolutely fine on the worst offenders of foods.",10,1742696868.0,GERD,2,0.86,False

He always came in during the busy morning rush, looking a little stressed. But one day, I noticed he seemed a bit more stressed or upset then normal, so I asked if everything was okay. He mentioned he was having a tough week.

I wanted to do a small gesture to try and help him cheer him up, so I wrote a little note on his cup that said, ""You’ve got this, you are appreciated!"" When I handed it to him, his face lit up, he smiled and said “Thanks kiddo, I really needed that.""

The next day, Kevin came in again, and with a big smile, he told me, “That note yesterday made my day so much better. Thank you.” It was a small gesture, but it meant a lot to both of us, and it reminded me how even the simplest kindness can brighten someone's day.

Some context, I am current using a Df54 and Varia VS3 with a bambino+ and flair58+. I wanted to condense my set up and color coordinate (white/silver)to improve the aesthetics of my coffee bar. I’ve decided on my machine, but I’m having trouble deciding on a grinder. I kind of narrowed it down to the following:

1. Eureka Mignon Zero 65 (haven’t heard too much on it but the price point is nice, looks great and it seems quiet enough)

2. Lagom Casa 65CL (heard this can do pretty much everything quite well, but I heard it has issues with bricking and dial drift?)

3. Niche Zero (amazing work flow, sounds the best, easy to switch between brew types, might not be the best for lighter roasts?)

4. Timemore 064S ( can do everything pretty well, looks nice, but burrs takes a lot of seasoning?)

We drink everything from very light roast to medium dark, espresso and filter, mostly americanos and lattes.  Another thought would be to just get the machine now and wait for something new or V2s/fixes to come out? Thanks in advance! 🙏

I hope this steam of consciousness isn’t completely muddled. 

First I’ll provide some history for context: my dad was always really mean & toxic, and I was always scared of him. He was never physically abusive to me or my immediate family but he’s beaten up many people in his younger days (he’s now 57) and strangled his younger sister (not to any extent of serious injury, but he did it in front of me when I was a child and it kind of traumatized me, I mostly just remember the glass table he flipped over shattering everywhere - he attacked her because she started dating some guy I think??). Despite not having ever physically harmed me, he’s made many threats to do so (along the lines of ‘I’ll cut your head off if so & so’). The most scared I’d ever been of him was when he found out I was failing some classes in high school - I was skipping classes and not doing the work because I was so depressed. Also, I was skipping class because it was the only time I could be outside - my dad didn’t let me go out and have a social life outside of going to school. We were arguing in the car about it and he started threatening me and I started crying and I said I was getting out of the car then and there and going to the cafe next to us (out of fear) and he assured me that he didn’t care if he’d have to kill me in front of everyone there and that going anywhere public wouldn’t save me. I could never escape him either because he was always home because he wouldn’t work and would just stay in the basement and smoke opium all day and all night. My mom is an absolute angel and the sweetest person on earth but I hardly ever got to see her because she’d work day and night constantly to keep us all afloat, she even slept over at her work site most of the time as a PSW in the old folks’ home. When I turned 18 I ran away from home and got on a bus to the other side of the country. I felt bad abandoning my little 8 year old brother and my mom, though, so after my mom pleaded for me to come back, I did so after only 3 days away. I thought for sure my dad would kill me but instead he had my mom sell the house she did all the work to pay for, took the money and moved to the other side of the world and left us all behind. It was the happiest day of my life when he left. Even though all 3 of us ended up renting and sharing one room in my grandmas house for a while and it was uncomfortable having 3 people to one room, I was on cloud 9. My mom tried to secure an apartment for us to rent but because of her bad credit score, no one would rent to us. We ended up having to go to a family shelter. We stayed there and in hotels from some time (it was at least a year) before we ended up in social housing. Any money my mom made my dad would still gobble it up from abroad saying he was trying to start a business. He never informed me about this, but he ended up getting remarried to a woman not much older than me. Actually my parents never even told me they got divorced, I just happened to find the divorce papers in the closet one day whilst rummaging in there for a file I needed.  When I asked my mom about it, she just said it was none of my business to go through her papers… After it was clear that he and my mom were finished, she still gave him money when he asked for it as the years went by, saying he’d pay it back with interest at a later time. Well, I’m 32 now. My dad never paid my mom back and lost all of the money and is done for. Unfortunately, he has since had 2 more daughters now currently aged 1 & 3. My brothers birthday is in May and last year in 2024 when we celebrated, my mom asked him at our celebration dinner whether or not my dad had reached out to say HBD and ofc the answer was no, basically my dad never reached out to us ever even on special occasions. I felt bad for my brother having grown up without a dad and thinking it would be good for them to stay in touch just a little bit, I texted my dad shortly after to ask if he’d like to have us fly over to visit him anywhere he’d like. He got back to me with some weird cryptic messages about how he’s sorry he’d been a terrible father to us and how he’s failed at life and asked me to “carry the torch” for him. I’m sure he was drunk. The next day he informs me that he attempted suicide the night before by cutting his wrists. He asks if he can come stay with me for a while. I’m emotionally distressed and despite not having a great relationship with my dad, I’m determined to help however I can. Of course it’s on me to pay for his $2000 ticket back to Canada - this is back in June 2024. I live in a tiny studio apartment and sharing the space with anyone would be difficult, much less a nervous wreck constantly biting his nails and needing me to help him do absolutely everything to get resettled back in Canada and helping him find his employment. It was a big toll on me psychologically and financially. I lasted 2 months of living in that small apartment with him that didn’t have any space to hide in aside from the bathroom before I couldn’t take it anymore. I couldn’t ask him to leave because that’d be asking him to go to a shelter and I just couldn’t bring myself to do that - despite it being ironic that he’s the reason my mom, brother, and I were all living in a shelter for some time. So instead I said I’d go to another city 3500 km away because I needed to just not be around him anymore. I abruptly quit my job and started working and now I’m working as a stripper in the place I relocated to because I now had to pay $2000 a month to cover the rent and utilities for my old apt he’s now living in on top of my own expenses I now had to incur in a new city (of course my dad doesn’t know I strip or it’d be the end of me, and a regular job won’t pay for us both). I stayed in a shelter for a month back in August while I saved up and looked for a place. I’m now renting a room for 1K in a hellhole with a creepy man that lives in filth, but it’s all I can afford. I wouldn’t mind working my ass off in a degrading, soul-sucking job and living this hell if he were a good dad and in any way deserving of the help I’m giving him but he made my whole life hell and continues to do so. And he doesn’t truly appreciate it; I don’t think so, anyway. For example, his drivers license was expired so I paid for him to get to do another test, and then he failed it and blamed me for pushing him to do it in the first place… like it’s my fault… this is what my mom relayed to me (she’s nice enough to still help him with everything too, getting him groceries and taking him to appointments and so on). All of this has been bugging me but I swallow it all and say it’s not just about him, he has two innocent toddlers depending on him to get his shit together, so helping him would also be helping them. Their mother is a wicked woman as well but I won’t get into that. I got accepted into a masters program for this upcoming fall - thankfully it’ll be completely free as I earned a full scholarship having graduated summa cum laude and excelled academically in university (despite the fact that I failed out of high school due to my depression in my teens, I flourished in school after my dad left) and I’ve been warning my dad since January when I received my acceptance that I’d need him out of my apartment by August because I can’t work enough hours while I’m in grad school to support us both, so at least I have an out. If he has to go to a shelter in August then that’s on him. I have almost 26,000 dollars in student loans and I could have paid all that off and then some with the money I’ve spent on keeping my dad afloat since this past summer. And even though he’s getting 700 a month in welfare and has zero bills aside from groceries, he called me today to ask for money. He said it was for coffee… I’m sure it was actually for cigarettes but he can’t tell me that because he lied and said he had quit (I know he was lying because my mom confirmed he asked her to buy him a pack of smokes last week). He might also be sending money back to his wife and kids to help them survive in the meantime, who knows. 

He’s been trying to find work, but I’m not convinced he’ll succeed. He has an engineering degree but hardly got any use of out of it, and hasn’t worked a job in close to 20 years. I don’t know what to do. If I have to send him to a shelter when September comes around, then I’m also going to have to deal with attacks from his family I’m sure. My grandma and uncle on his side have been praising me for helping him - while they’ve done nothing to help personally. Though to be fair, my dad refuses to see any of them despite them all being in the same city because he’s too mentally messed up to face anyone - he wouldn’t even let me tell my mom/brother that he returned to live with me until 4/5 months after moving in with me (ofc I told my mom because I needed at least one person to vent to but I just pretended she didn’t know anything so everything was on my shoulders to step up and help him when he came around).

I remember that as a young child, I secretly prayed my dad would divorce my mom or get ill and die. That sounds terrible I know, but that’s how much my dad was making me unhappy even then. I even summoned the guts to outright ask my parents for divorce when I was 7/8 and when they asked me why I said it was because I wanted 2 presents on my birthday instead of 1 so as not to hurt his feelings, when the reality was that I just wanted him out of my life. In a way, although I’m sure it was hard on my brother to grow up without a dad, I think he was lucky that my dad left while he was still young. 

I’m so tired. And I miss my mom. And my friends. And my dog. All I want is to be able to live in my old apartment by myself again.

P.S. I’m fully aware my mom’s an enabler and should have cut him out of our lives for everyone’s sake and now I’m following in her footsteps. She even took all the money out of what little savings she accumulated for my uni because my dad asked for it. Moments like that make me realize that although she has good intentions, she’s bonkers to help him at her children’s expense, and I’m equally bonkers to help him at my own.",2,1742696684.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I'm going to try not to ramble through this. So- Myself (24f) and my three friends (24 f/f/m) have been a friend group since early high school. I was friends with them all separately at first and brought us together. We always did things together and have always had a group chat. Last summer I started my first job out of college as a middle school teacher. My worst decision to date, it has ruined my mental health and I feel like a shell of my former self, I'm not going back to teaching next year. This is not beside the point. So I started to back off our plans, I didn't have the energy or money to go out to clubs every weekend, multiple weeknight dinners/coffees, all the fun things we used to do. I maintained communication in the group chat as much as I could, but slowly I noticed, even as I would initiate hangouts and still hang out with them, they would start making plans without me. I would start seeing instagram posts of functions I had never heard of. I noticed they had a group chat without me. They stopped talking to me individually as much. So one night we went to dinner and I brought it up, how I felt a little pushed out of the group and would like to be invited to things still, even if I can't make every plan. They turned this on me, and said that they ""felt rejected"" when I would decline to hang out. I tried to explain why, how I was feeling, how my job was ruining my life, but I ended up the only person apologizing for anything that night, and they resumed doing the same thing. Since then it's just the three of them hanging out all the time. I don't really want to re enter the friend group because ive already missed a lot and I feel like there's a reason for this besides me saying no too many times. Like, there has to be something.

(religious minority in the US not LDS) This program has us in two separate cities helping the local churches in the area. So, anyway, we met during the program's orientation week, we caught glances of each other, talked a few times, and became pen pals. This eventually escalated to us texting frequently and calling a few times, we would meet in-person around once a month (initially in groups with other members but occasionally 1:1 lunches and stuff).

We developed a mutual attraction, especially given that we share the same graduate program goals + values, and we seem to click on personality. TBH I really enjoyed spending time with her. However, one of this program's rules is no relationships with other members ( for obvious reasons). My original plan was to wait it out till spring before I'd ask her out on a date, with the idea being to go on a few dates, then after the program ends, make it official.

However, unbeknownst to me, she had a very close family member who was ill and expected to pass. Unfortunately, this came to be sooner than previously thought. She had to handle a lot of the affairs regarding the passing on top of everything (from my knowledge, they seemed to share a complex relationship/ living states apart) I sent a condolence message as soon as I found out. Eventually, I got a piece of religious art with a condolence card signed by a few members, and for that month's pen pal letter, I added a few postcards of some places I had recently been to and generally a more suped-up letter. I mailed it to her, she sent me a thank you response over text a few days later + we had a light-hearted text discussion about our opinions on some grad school stuff. This all happened late January/ early February. I just sent a message out to her yesterday since a small memorial service marking the month and a half passing is scheduled this weekend. The message reminded her that we're praying for her + saying that I'm always here if she needs something, etc.

The thing is, how do I proceed from here? My plan is to hopefully meet up with her 1:1 mid-April to catch up over coffee and just say at the end something along the lines of ""I wanted to ask you this sooner, I would love if the next time we met 1:1 it would be a date, I understand that you're going through a decent and if you need time to think this over thats more than fine""

But really that's my current plan, like I really would like some advice on how to move forward especially since we have an established relationship and I really don't want to be dragging her along. I also want to be supportive and respectful of her situation.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.

1jhoxsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hashimotos/comments/1jhoxsi/im_unsure_whats_going_on/,Im unsure whats going on??,"Hi so im new to all of this. Might be a bit of a long post, im just looking for some insight. I am currently getting a second opinion on these but id like to hear from yall.

So I recently got a new family doctor. She noted that in my physical exam, there was a goitre on my neck so she sent me for some bloodwork and an ultrasound. The ultrasound did confirm that I have an enlarged thyroid, but the blood work was all within range. The doctor asked me what my symptoms were and at first I wasn’t really sure I didn’t know about hypo or hyper or anything like that. It was new to me so I said I didn’t know she said for now we’re just gonna watch it and come back to me if anything else happens. Obviously when I got home, I looked up the symptoms for both of them to kind of see maybe if anything was there and I did notice some. I had a little bit on hypo a little bit on hyper however, nothing was severe and nothing was super consistent and caused me any worry. As well, some of them i had been dealing with for years, since i was a child. I did ask abt family history, my mom said both my aunts and grandma have hypo but nothing regarding Hashi.

I had a little bit of swelling in my neck one time it was late at night, nothing severe but just slightly noticeable, so I booked another appointment. She sent me for another ultrasound and another bloodwork. She again asked me if I had any new symptoms or if there was any pain. There was no pain in the goitre or when I touched my neck at all and no new symptoms, but I did let her know that I thought I recognized some of them, but they were again not consistent and not severe, not causing me any serious worry. I told her of my family history too. As well i told her that in my records it showed my previous doctor had been testing my tsh yearly. She believes I had acute thyroiditis because at the time of my first bloodwork, and my first ultrasound I was recovering from a common cold. As well, she thinks this because i have little to no symptoms and they are not consistent or severe.  
I received the results and the second ultrasound confirmed that my thyroid had actually shrunk from the first time however, on the second bloodwork, she tested my PTH, TPO, and TSH. The only thing out of range is my TPO. Since my last blood work my T3, T4 and TSH, have gone down.

So my blood work from the first appointment is  Dec 23 enlarged thyroid- thyroiditis 
t4 is 18.7pmol/L  
t3 is 5.6pmol/L 
tsh is 2.10mlU/L

My most recent is now 
March 20 doesn’t say thyroiditis just said no significant thyroid abnormalities detected 
T4 is 15.6 pmol/L
T3 is 4.8 pmol/L
Tsh is 1.32 mlU/L

PTH 24 ng/L
TPO 51 klU/L (says range is <35 klU/L)


As for the symptoms I had referred to I was mainly talking about the basic ones such as the changes in bowel movement, the changes in menstruation, the fatigue, skin problems, weight, and hair loss. I have struggled with constipation for quite a long time, since childhood,it tends to come and go depending on what I eat related to dairy I try to limit it, but it does not affect me in any other way other than just binding me up a bit I don’t get tummy aches. I don’t get sickness. I don’t get cramping just a bit of binding so I allow myself the occasional ice cream and the occasional yogurt. Im fine to cook butter and I’m fine to have a splash of milk in my coffee but larger amounts tend to bind me up. Again this one is not consistent as even sometimes with eating larger amount or dairy i am able to still go regularly. Next would be changes in menstruation. I have noticed that my period has gotten shorter and has gotten lighter, which is the opposite of what I have read online and have seen from other people. It has not been something that has happened super quick it has been over the last few years, but it is something that I’ve noticed. But again no additional pain, no large amount of bleeding and I don’t have any other noticeable symptoms relating to that. The fatigue is something that I have been experiencing. There are certain days when I’m at work specifically where I just feel extra tired and extra out of it I did speak to my coworker about brain fog and she thought maybe upping my vitamins or something like that would help so I did take a multivitamin for a little bit. However, the fatigue did not stay long and it was not super severe as to where I could not get out of bed, to where I could not drive, to where I could not do any of that. It was just like a an overall tired feeling. For the weight section I have not noticed any changes in weight. Overall, I have stayed around the same kilograms give or take a few depending on the day, you know how it is. I have not noticed any severe hairloss or hair changes, ive had dry frizzy hair since childhood. Just for skin problems I do have eczema on my hands which acts up mostly in the winter however, I have not noticed any new changes on any other parts of my body, and I have not had any extreme flareups.

Overall I’m just looking to hear others personal experiences and possibly find others that experienced similar situations such as mine. Again sorry for the long post, i wanted to try and give as much context as possible, i will be seeing a second doctor in April to get a second opinion. This is new to me as i didn’t know that it even ran it the family and I’ve been privileged enough to not have heard about this before. Just trying to get some personal perspectives as its confusing that my bloodwork and ultrasound changed in such a short time. As well as the tpo being high but not having any consistent or severe symptoms. 🫤",1,1742696059.0,Hashimotos,0,1.0,False

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1742696058.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

I've struggled with my eating all my life. I'm almost 20 years old and never found a median of not eating enough period and eating too much at a time.
For reference I'm five foot one, and weigh 125 pounds and I work in a busy pharmacy, constantly walking and carrying heavy things. Anyway, as of late I've been eating too much... 
I moved in with my partner and he has been basically feeding me/initiating in meals before I do mostly and I feel like I'm eating too much! 
I used to only eat about one big/medium meal a day and be fine but lately I've been eating alot.
A sandwich in the morning and then sushi for lunch and still hungry for a big dinner. (For example of the days I eat alot)
But these past two days I've eaten. Alot. 
Yesterday I ate Indian food, rice sauce and appetizers you name it. Two chicken wings AND 3 1/2 pieces of sausage pizza.
Today I ate just as much!!! 2 cups of coffee, half a bowl of chicken Chipotle pasta from cheesecake factory and they gave me a scoop of ice cream and fudge for my birthday, I ate 2 slices of sausage pizza, a biscuit and 2 pieces of fried chicken and extra chicken skin.
I feel like I'm binging so much and getting more boxier (I don't mind gaining wait but it makes me look so boxy!!!) And I'm binging beyond repair?... I'm so sad and just want a normal relationship with food. ",0,1742696051.0,BingeEatingDisorder,1,0.5,False
