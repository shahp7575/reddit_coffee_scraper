Hey everyone! ü§óüß†

Lately, I find myself more amped than ever about the rapid rise of AI automation, and I wanted to get our community‚Äôs thoughts on some new trends ‚Äî and how we‚Äôre all *feeling* about it!

For the last few years, I think we all knew this was coming. The autofill, the autocorrect, the ‚ÄúHey Alexa, turn on the lights‚Äù moments. But wow, have the horizons expanded:

- Machine learning sorting your inbox?
- AI scheduling your work meetings (and even sending polite follow-ups)?
- Full-blown workflows ‚Äî code, business ops, content generation ‚Äî powered by a handful of prompts?

I mean‚Ä¶can you imagine that silly ‚Äúdo my homework‚Äù wish we ALL had as kids now being legit possible for everything from lesson plans to weekly meal prep? There‚Äôs an undeniable thrill in realizing *how much stuff is just a click away from being automated*!

But here‚Äôs where the excitement *really* spikes for me:

- New AI tools are empowering solo entrepreneurs to operate at the scale of teams.
- Artists and content creators can iterate, remix, and distribute at the speed of thought.
- Task automation means we get to spend more time actually *thinking* and *playing*, instead of managing repetitive busywork.

Picture this: You wake up, coffee in hand, and an AI personal assistant has digested your whole email inbox, sorted tasks, prepped files, scheduled your day, and even offered ideas for tonight‚Äôs dinner. How much more could you accomplish? How much stress gets zapped?

Sure, there are challenges and ethical questions ‚Äî we can‚Äôt ignore that. But today, I want to focus on the *giddy possibilities*, not the sci-fi doom scrolls. A healthy mix of curiosity and ambition can help us shape these tools into something magical.

Let‚Äôs geek out together! ü§ì‚ú®

- What‚Äôs the cleverest AI-powered automation you‚Äôve set up (or seen lately)?
- Has getting rid of repetitive tasks genuinely given you more freedom, or did it just‚Ä¶ create more time for other busywork?
- What‚Äôs your ‚Äúdream automation‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt exist yet, but absolutely *should*?

Tell me your wins! Share your WILD ideas! Let‚Äôs keep this thread buzzing ‚Äî every tiny automation can open doors to big creative energy, and I‚Äôm HYPED to hear what everyone‚Äôs building or dreaming up. üöÄ

Happy automating, everyone ‚Äî can‚Äôt wait to read your thoughts!",1,1754345443.0,GPTAppsEngine,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve seen many people put out their experience and thought I would do the same to help out those thinking about joining. For background, I am a high school student (16, very young) with a little food experience but relied mostly on volunteer work and extracurriculars to answer questions. US store btw

I applied online through starbucks website for barista position. In about 2 or 3 days I had a response in my email that basically asked me a few questions like my availability and why I wanted to work there. I responded and in 2 days I got a response saying they wanted to set up an in person interview

I walked into the store, said I had an interview, sat down and the store manager came out. (ps they ask you a drink you want and they make it for free, don‚Äôt try to pay) we started with a coffee tasting, they asked me questions like what do you taste, where in your mouth you feel it, etc. he then introduced himself and so did i. he asked me a lot of questions, i don‚Äôt remember all of them but there was ‚Äúwhy do you want to work here‚Äù ‚Äútell a time where you disagreed with a supervisor‚Äù ‚Äútell me a time where you had to follow directions closely‚Äù ‚Äútell me a time where you gave excellent customer service‚Äù.

overall i think there was like 8 or 9 questions and he wrote down what i said for each one. then he asked me if I had any questions, and I had a few ones and at the end, he told me that he liked me and wanted to move me onto a second interview with the district manager (which was a surprise but apparently now new employees need two interviews, one with store manager and one with district manager). I got an email the day after confirming my interview time for my second interview. overall, the first interview was about 45 minutes for me

for the second interview, it was just the district manager, the first store manager i interviewed with wasn‚Äôt there. I got another free drink and We started with a coffee tasting again but this time it was a different blend. I was asked again the same coffee questions as before. she then introduced herself, then i did. this interview was super short. I was only asked 3 questions, one of them was the same question as the first interview ‚Äútell me about a time you gave excellent customer service‚Äù. I don‚Äôt remember the other 2 but they were very similar to questions I was asked in the first, just worded a little differently? Overall I responded with the same things I said the first interview. if you did good the first interview, you don‚Äôt need to worry about the second. At the end, she thanked me and said she and the store manager would discuss and I would hear a response from them in a few days.

as for tips, i feel like definitely personality and bonding with interviewer. dont be shy or anti social, treat the interview more like a conversation than an interrogation and definitely give examples of good customer service or connection. and have questions prepared to ask at the end of the interview be outgoing and true to yourself!

2 days later, I got a call from the store basically saying they had a good time talking with me and was interested in hiring me! I was emailed a background check form, which I completed and 2 days later they sent a follow up email with the official job offer as well as the onboarding process.

onboarding was basically just filling out a few online forms, accepting terms and conditions. along with the onboarding process email was another email from my store manager where he basically told me to complete everything and then come in. The next day after onboarding I stopped in store, and he looked through some identification and handed me my training schedule. 

I start training in a few days!! Any tips or advice from experienced baristas that you wish you would‚Äôve heard when you started? Also, what was training like for you guys? any clue how long it is / how it works and what should i expect for my first day or first week?",1,1754345318.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

I (28F) moved to a very rural location two years ago for work and am struggling to make friends. I am single after getting out of a relationship about half a year ago. My small village is full of old people, and the closest city is about 1h 30 drive away (in the UK thats a long way!).

My work colleagues are extremely geographically spread, and I am the only woman in our team of 25. All of my colleagues except one, who lives 1h 30 away in the nearby city and is the same age as me (of whom is the focus of this post!) are approximately 60 years old.

I've been trying to make friends with the guy who is the same age as me. He often mentions he is lonely and I know he wants to move away from the city he currently lives in - so figured we could be pals. We are both single.

We've met up quite a few times now outside of work, and I've stayed the night at his place (nothing happened!). When we hang out its always good fun and we get on well. However - he never ever messages me or invites me out. All 5 times we have done an activity or whatever, I have messaged him beforehand. He was even visiting 15 mins down the road from where I live for work but I was the one to ask if he wanted to meet for coffee lol.

His personality is very closed off and shy - other co-workers have made jokes that its like talking to a brick wall. But in the times we've hung out, I've seen his goofy and sassy personality come out and has brought me to tears from laughing. But I just can't shake that maybe he feels pressured to say yes to hanging out? I have asked him if he wants to be friends, and he said yes. Even suggested an activity, but never followed through on it. 

am I just wasting my time with someone who isn't actually interested in making friends? I'd love to get perspective on if I should leave him alone. Thanks!

TLDR: shy colleague is fun to be around but never initiates us meeting up or rarely starts a text convo, claims he wants to be friends, do I keep putting in all the effort?",1,1754345305.0,makemychoice,0,1.0,False

1mhrbhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1mhrbhz/boss_upset_i_called_in_on_0_hour_contract/,Boss upset I called in on 0 hour contract,"Hiya everyone! Hoping to get some preliminary advice here in case things go south. I need to add details for context so apologies if it‚Äôs long, there‚Äôs a TLDR at the end.

I‚Äôm (25f) a barista at an independent coffee shop (owned by one person), employed for the last 1 1/2 years in England (UK native). The owner also owns another shop which has been established for almost 20 years in another town. That shop will be called Shop A.

I work alone, 7.30am-5.30pm in a town centre, 3-4 days a week at the second location. This shop will be called Shop B. It‚Äôs been open just about a year.

 All employees in both shops are on a 0 hour contract and national minimum wage for our age brackets. We essentially pick our most convenient days. We aren‚Äôt supposed to get more than 4 shifts a week. 

Both shops are open 7 days a week, only closed Christmas Day. As the title says, I‚Äôm on a 0 hour contract but generally work 3-4 days a week. **I‚Äôm the ONLY employee with a car, 7 day availability, at either location and full capability of opening and closing either shop.**

I‚Äôm one of 2 regular employees at Shop B, as it is a manageable 40 minute walk from me and we have a random third employee on a Saturday during the busier periods between 10-3pm. 

Shop B is much, much quieter than Shop A, pulling in between a 1/4 or a 1/2 of what Shop A makes per day. Which is why there are only 2 employees.

However, Monday-Friday and Sunday, we are both lone workers for standard operating hours. The owner will come in for about 2-3 hours each day to complete paperwork and publish/edit rotas. He refuses to hire anyone else for Shop B, despite the growing pile of CVs under the till, because he wants employees with full availability for both shops, who can travel to Shop A for training and can reliably make their own way there and back. Keep this in mind.

The owner is a character, having a self-proclaimed ‚Äúhigh IQ‚Äù and ‚Äúdesign mind‚Äù and specific way of doing things. He regularly falls out with people and tells us about the arguments he‚Äôs had with people (keep this in mind) who all conveniently are incompetent idiots and deliberately malicious or out to get him. 

Now, neither I nor the other employee in Shop B, during standard operating hours, are permitted to close the shop for any reason, except to lock the door to use the toilet very sparingly. Neither of us can even take a mandatory 20 minute break, we eat when we can. 
If one of us needs to call out sick, go on holiday, cannot work for any reason, the other person usually does their shifts. However, because only 2 of us are available regularly to work in Shop B, you could see how this might cause issues.

I had a family emergency last week that I was alerted very late into the night to, about 1am. I was due to open Shop B in just about 7 hours from then. I knew by its nature I wouldn‚Äôt be back in time to have a restful sleep and open the shop. It was all I could do, I had no time to think. I was just panicking and gave as much notice as I could.

I texted the owner, rather than calling him that late and told him I wouldn‚Äôt be able to make it and if he could please find cover, I would let him know about the next day‚Äôs shift. I got no response even later into the morning, nor afternoon. It wasn‚Äôt until I texted in the evening that it was sorted and I could do my next day‚Äôs shift that he replied with a very curt; ‚ÄúI‚Äôve found cover, it‚Äôs too late.‚Äù

I replied with an ‚Äúokay!‚Äù And spent the day with my family instead. I text him that evening asking if I was permitted to do the next shift, he replied, ‚ÄúI have cover if necessary.‚Äù I told him it wasn‚Äôt necessary and my issue had been seen to.

He didn‚Äôt come in that day, nor for the rest of my shifts that week. I had been informed not by the owner, nor any other employee that the shop had been closed on the day I had called out, but by a regular customer and an incomplete cashing up sheet. When I asked my coworkers, apparently nobody could cover that day and the owner had to very reluctantly close the shop.

He avoided me for an entire week, despite me sending texts over the following days asking if he would be able to discuss the previous week. This was mostly for my benefit as I don‚Äôt like to leave issues and resentment to fester, especially in the workplace and wanted to make sure he knew my reason for calling out was genuine. This is also despite the fact he likes to talk about all the people he‚Äôs confronted about issues in his life and totally owned.

Today we finally had that discussion along with some other issues. I told him I understood he was angry about having to close the shop. He told me it was a fire-able offense and that he‚Äôs done it before, I didn‚Äôt believe him as I talk regularly with my coworkers about ex-coworkers and none of them have ever brought up that reasoning for anyone leaving or getting the sack.

I also know he cannot sack me at all without repeating last week‚Äôs issue but permanently. There would then only be 1-2 employees to operate Shop B. Essentially I know if he could sack me he would. 

But because he won‚Äôt hire anyone else or can‚Äôt find anyone with my specific benefits, he can‚Äôt. He also knows this. He is just throwing empty threats out.

He also asked about what my family emergency was (it was private and I was asked not to say by the person involved, not to mention he‚Äôs not allowed to ask) and essentially accused me of lying about it.

I was wondering what my recourse might be for the fact I can‚Äôt take a break and have been penalized for taking a day off despite giving notice as much as I could and staying in touch about availability and I‚Äôm on a 0hour contract.

I‚Äôve been looking for something else for a while and this really rubbed me the wrong way. ",0,1754345159.0,LegalAdviceUK,2,0.5,False

1mhr5wh,https://i.redd.it/z641d12sr2hf1.jpeg,Why Is Hangeul So Easy That It Ruined your Life?,"Hangul, the Korean alphabet, allows you to easily combine consonants and vowels like Legos to create words. 

Its consistent pronunciation makes it simple to learn. Its short letters allow for quick communication, making it ideal for social media. 

Furthermore, it's easy to read, even when drunk, and foreigners are amazed by its simplicity and logical structure. However, the downside is that it's so easy to learn that it can discourage you from learning other languages! In short, Hangul is both a superhero and a potential obstacle to language learning ü¶∏‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®.


1. Lego-Level Simplicity

Hangeul works like Lego blocks ‚Äî

consonants and vowels snap together seamlessly. ‚Äò„Ñ±‚Äô + ‚Äò„Öè‚Äô = ‚Äòga‚Äô, ‚Äò„Ñ¥‚Äô + ‚Äò„Öì‚Äô = ‚Äòneo‚Äô. Before you know it, you‚Äôre building words like a pro! Meanwhile, English letters like ‚ÄúC‚Äù switch between ‚Äúk‚Äù and ‚Äús‚Äù, making it feel like a Transformers robot with identity issues.  


2. No Betrayal in Pronunciation

Hangeul‚Äôs sounds are loyal. ‚Äò„Ñ±‚Äô is always ‚Äúg‚Äù, ‚Äò„Öè‚Äô is always ‚Äúa‚Äù. But English? ‚ÄúG‚Äù becomes ‚Äúj‚Äù or ‚Äúg‚Äù, and ‚ÄúT‚Äù turns into ‚Äútuh‚Äù or ‚Äúter‚Äù. It‚Äôs like your friend ghosting you mid-conversation! (Example: Why does ‚Äúgift‚Äù sound like ikst?)  


3. King Sejong‚Äôs Social Media Masterpiece
 
   Designed for lightning-fast texting, Hangeul dominates chat apps. ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù takes 12 keystrokes in English, while ‚Äúsaranghae‚Äù (love) is just 4 letters! Plus, it supports emoji-level shorthand like ‚Äúkk‚Äù or ‚Äúhh‚Äù‚Äîproof King Sejong was a 21st-century meme lord.  


4. Drunk-Proof Reading
 
Even tipsy, you can read Hangeul! ‚ÄúRamyeon‚Äù stays ‚Äúramyeon‚Äù, and ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù doesn‚Äôt morph into ‚Äúcof-fee‚Äù at 2 AM. But try reading ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù when drunk in English‚Äîyou might end up yelling, ‚ÄúWhy is it ‚Äòikstr‚Äô instead of ‚Äòko-fi‚Äô?!‚Äù


5. Foreigners Learn It in 30 Minutes?
 
Foreigners often gasp, ‚ÄúIs this real?!‚Äù Take ‚Äúdak‚Äù (chicken)‚Äîit literally spells out the sound ‚Äúkokkio‚Äù (cock-a-doodle-doo)! Meanwhile, ‚Äúchicken‚Äù in English has zero connection to birds. It‚Äôs like calling a burger ‚Äúmeat-patty‚Äù instead.  


Hangeul is so scientifically, artistically, and practically perfect that it‚Äôs almost too easy. üá∞üá∑‚ú®  

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Excessive admiration for Hangeul may cause foreign language learning apathy. Proceed with caution! üòÖ

I recently have been going through some stuff lately and hoped anyone from here could help out. I switched to online school due to bullying that happened in high school and it got very bad to the point where my mental health was on the edge and I didn‚Äôt feel like there was any way out. I was luckily switched to online school eventually and had 8 months of peace prior doing online school. 

October of 2024 is where everything changed and some new neighbors moved in next to my family‚Äôs house. At first I didn‚Äôt think much of it but turns out there was this guy and his friend who noticed me and probably recognized me from my old high school I used to go to even though they seemed old and both of them drove. The first guy let‚Äôs call black truck as black truck day by day after coming home from work would rev up his truck on purpose just to scare me and whenever I moved around different places in my home he‚Äôd do the same thing relentlessly. His friend who soon stayed as well let‚Äôs call him red car, red car would relentlessly honk his horn play ringing noises out of nowhere or when I was moving around different parts of my house, or either him or black truck would hit stuff making obnoxious noises to scare me just out of the blew or everything they heard me make a noise in my home. 

It was even more suspicious that they had a camera outside their porch set up by early next year purposely facing my home to see if they could record or film me. A time where red car was stalking me was when I was going out in my garage to get creamer for my mom since we ran out of it for coffee, then as I opened my garage door I could hear from outside at the neighbors home red car relentlessly honking his car to scare me. Another time I knew I was being stalked was late at night getting water for myself after eating some brownies and my nails which are a little long accidentally brushed against my metal pink water bottle, then black truck guy started to hit stuff by my room since he heard me even though it was 12 at night. It got bad to the point where I feel afraid to leave my own room since I do online school and now I have men scoping me to see if I make a noise or if I‚Äôm home. 

I tried telling family about it and even recorded videos for evidence before hand since my online friend suggested it to me and even my cousin. I had plenty of evidence to show if I ever visited the police station once. I visited my Nina‚Äôs one day for a pool party and thought it was safe to tell the situation I was dealing with to her, turns out I was wrong as my Nina told my mom I should get therapy even though what I told my Nina was the truth but I guess the truth can‚Äôt always be proven. So my mom yelled and cried at me saying she won‚Äôt be getting me things anymore if I act like this and the same went for my dad as all my family did not believe I was getting stalked except my online friend and cousin. I felt like I had no voice whatsoever and my older brother even forced me to delete all evidence videos off my phone so I wouldn‚Äôt go to the police to tell them I‚Äôm being stalked. I feel trapped right now to this day and don‚Äôt know what to do. It‚Äôs already been 10 months those guys have been stalking me and they don‚Äôt seem to stop, if there‚Äôs any advice out there anyone could give me I would forever be grateful.

Also I'm aware that this sub is for Williamsburg, but the cafe serves the Williamsburg/Greenpoint area so figured it'd be ok to post it here too but Mods, let me know if you don't allow posts like that, I can remove it.  I already posted it to r/Greenpoint [Link to Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Greenpoint/s/8I38LCRHZt)


Writing here to expose this place for all the lying scum they've put me, my ex coworkers and the community through. 

Recently Greenburg cafe on Franklin St in Greenpoint opened up back in the beginning of the summer of this year, and I left my last job in February was searching for a new gig after my semester ended (im in Undergrad) and Greenburg called me for an interview, liked me and my experience and hired me in mid May and I left in early June. 

HOLY SH*T did I walk through the gates of hell. 

So first of all, in the month that I worked there, my own and my co-workers paychecks always had errors, we were never paid correctly for our hours and even on our pay stubs it was incorrect. My own check would say I worked just 12 hours for 2 weeks when in reality I worked for 26 hours (yes, I was clocked in for all my shifts). And the same thing happend to my coworkers as well, one of them was paid for $17/hour when she was promised $20/hour. Everytime we went to the owner (its owned by a couple, but the woman is the one thats incharge of daily operations) would give us the run-around and tell us workers, to personally contact the accountant, fully ignoring any and all responsibility and blaming the accountant. 50% of the time when you would contact those accountant she would either give you some lackluster excuse like ""I'll look  into it"" or ""Send me the correct hours you worked"" or the other 50% of the time she would just completely ignore you and not messages back. Wait, Hang on, get this. The accountant was in CALIFORNIA, so there was absolutely no way to physically go to her office and ask for her. So you're basically at their mercy for your unpaid wages and if you ask the owner about the accountant ignoring you, she'll eventually get irate and accuse you of being the bad person for asking you for your proper paycheck and that ""you need to stop bothering her and just wait"". 1 girl I worked with said the owners boyfriend (they're not married but have a kid) yelled at her over the phone when she called about her check and told her ""Its the accountants responsibility! Call her!"". Red Flag #1. 

Red Flag #2, The owner has absolutely no idea how to run a cafe, she admitted to us to our faces ""Yeah I have no idea how a cafe runs I barely drink coffee myself, so that's all on you guys"". So from the get-go there's no standards, no official rules, which explains why so many customers complain about their drinks being made wrong, because the workers have nothing to go by. You're pretty much set up for failure. When first hired we did a  1 day ""training"" at another roastery on Grand st if I remember correctly, but again there's no official rules in beverages in the actual cafe itself. 

Red Flag #3. Everything is Wildly overpriced, the same Matcha you can get at somewhere like MokaCafe or Sippy Cafe or Odd Fox cafe for $5 is like $6-$7 and its the exact same as those other places. They have a ""Triamisu"" latte/matcha. Thats like over $8. Its just a Mocha/chocolate matcha with whipped cream Thats it. Just add chocolate syrup to your latte or matcha and thats the ""Tiramisu"". Again, pretty much shelling out near $10 for something you can get somewhere else for $5. The Avocado toast is worse. I think the Greek toast is like $12 or $13? And its just basic country loaf bread with cream cheese, feta, onions and tomatoes and olives. Its about the size of a Roku TV remote, yeah again OVERPRICED. Don't waste your money, please just save it and go somewhere else. 

Finally, Red Flag #4. They hire and fire people like a revolving door. They'll hire someone, let them work for a few weeks then fire then for meaningless reasons. One of my coworkers got fired because they accused him of ""sweating too much"" (üòë) that man barely sweated a drop so I have absolutely no clue what they were talking about. The guy I worked with that did food they fired him for whatever reason, I have no idea why because he was really nice and helpful. Then rehired him and ""apologized"" saying they changed their minds (üòê). Don't be surprised if you go there regularly and see 1 barista for a few weeks then never see em again and there's a whole new team. And then next week there's a whole new team again. Ridiculous.

With every disaster that happens with this place, if you complain to the owner at all, they always pull the excuse ""We're new! We just opened so we need to work out the kinks and we'll have rough starts"". Uhm, ma'am. Not paying your employees their proper wages on time, screwing with their hours on file, having absolutely no standards before you even open, and hiring and firing good honest workers for false claims of nonsense has absolutely nothing to do with ""Being a new business"". It has to do with you being oblivious to morals and ethics and also pulling a scam and screwing over both workers and paying customers.

So basically as you can tell, this place is terrible, has no idea what in the world they're doing with their business. Screw over both employees and customers. I recently heard from my former manager that apparently the couple used to live in California and the woman apparently owns other businesses over there like a weed shop and a bunch of Airbnbs. She tried to open this place over there but couldn't so they moved to NYC to try their luck in Greenpoint since this neighborhood is becoming trendy. 

TL;DR Stay the hell away from this place. DO NOT apply for a job here if you're looking for a side gig/extra cash. DO NOT come here and waste your money on overpriced drinks that will be made incorrectly. Don't be fooled by the decor and how ""modern, minimalist"" it looks. The owners are scum and should be barred from opening up a business ever again. 

Edit: Forgot to mention, the cafe likes to collaborate with social media influences, Smaller businesses like fashion boutiques, book clubs, etc. if you run anything like that in Brooklyn/NYC area DO NOT engage with them, DO NOT do any kind of business with them. I was also told by my old coworkers that the owner did business with a guy that did food supply or something? And completely screwed him over by not paying him for his shipment. But yeah this place is a complete scam, stay far away and feel free to share this post to others

Everyone expected the business tycoon to discard her. Instead, she calmly revealed her array of hidden identities. The cold-blooded man doted on her, shocking those who had mistreated her into begging for mercy.
=====
""Mrs. Gibson, do you have anything to say about your husband showing up at Marilee Jenkins' birthday party today and announcing that he's going to divorce you?""
""People are saying Marilee is Mr. Gibson's first love and the real daughter of your parents, while you're the fake. You've been enjoying her parents' love all this time and married to the man meant for her. Do you feel bad about that?""
The birthday party was crowded, and Alexia Gibson found herself completely trapped. 
Reporters quickly closed in on her, pushing cameras and microphones into her face as camera flashes burst from every direction, giving her no space to breathe. 
""Your parents just said you're not really their daughter and cut off your money.""
""You've been out of work for two years, living as a housewife, so how exactly do you plan to support yourself now? Mrs. Gibson, any comments?""
Alexia just stood there, frozen. Her mind was still spinning from everything she'd just heard. 
So this Marilee Jenkins was the real daughter of her so-called parents and her husband's true love. 
And her? She was Roger Gibson's wife on paper, but clearly, just a joke to everyone else. 

Years ago, the Jenkins couple had pulled her out of some run-down neighborhood overseas, saying she was their long-lost daughter. 

But had they really not bothered doing a simple DNA test before welcoming her in? 

Why did they only discover the mistake now? 

Alexia's body tensed up. Her eyes drifted over to the man standing next to her. 

However, Roger's attention was not on her. He was looking at Marilee, as if they were the only ones in the room. 

Her voice came out strained as she asked, ""Why? You didn't even tell me.""

Roger's face was as cold as stone.

""Now you know. That's all that matters. It's over, Alexia. You were never good enough for me. Our marriage? Just a transaction. The only woman I've ever loved is Marilee. And you know why I never touched you after the wedding? Because you disgust me. You're like a spoiled dish--completely unappetizing.""

His eyes swept over her from head to toe, full of scorn. Her simple clothes, those outdated glasses--everything about her clashed with the glossy, high-class world he lived in. 

Before his harsh words even fully sank in, Alexia lifted her glass and threw the ch**pagne right into his face. 

The drink hit him with a loud splash, soaking his face and pricey suit. He just stood there, stunned, as the li**id dripped from his hair and down his face. 

""A spoiled dish? You told me you wanted an ordinary housewife. Dad and Mom told me they wanted an obedient daughter, who never outdid anyone!""

Without hesitation, she threw the glass to the floor. The sharp crash instantly silenced the whole room. 

Roger's face turned red with embarrassment. His jaw tightened. ""Have you lost your mind?""

From the stage, the Jenkins couple yelled at her. ""Alexia, this is Marilee's birthday, not a place for your drama!""

People in the crowd rolled their eyes and muttered that she was nuts. 

None of them had a clue what she had given up for the two families all these years. 

Shoving through the crowd, Alexia made a beeline for the exit. Reporters swarmed after her like a flood. 

She shoved past them all, blind to the pouring rain, deaf to the murmurs and judgment surrounding her. 

Right now, all she wanted was to get away--far from the noise, the eyes, and the humiliation. 

But just as she broke through the crowd and made it outside, a bunch of Marilee's wild fans shoved her hard, and she slipped, landing on the wet road. 

Marilee was an A-list star in showbiz. Her birthday party was being livestreamed, and tons of fans had gathered outside.

The second they saw Alexia step out, the crowd lost it, shouting like wild animals who had just found something to attack. 

""Alexia, you've got some nerve attending Marilee's birthday party. You've got no shame!""

""You're not even the real daughter. Just go back to whatever dump you came from, or are you too hooked on the Jenkins' money?""

""Roger's going to divorce you, and you still think it's okay to show your face around Marilee? Who do you think you are?""

""Go away already!""

Alexia lay there on the wet street, frozen for a second, while their nasty words echoed all around her. 

She let out a dry, bitter laugh. Everything was such a joke. A broken marriage, a cold family, and now they'd left her completely humiliated. 

What was the point of pretending for so long? She had kept her head down, put up with everything, and this was what she got in the end? 

A wave of helplessness washed over her. She closed her eyes, not even caring anymore as the freezing rain drenched her. 

Through the noise and chaos, a flattering voice broke through. ""Mr. Mason."" The polite greeting was followed by firm, steady footsteps coming closer in the rain. 

Moments later, a black umbrella appeared above her, silently cutting through the rain and offering her shelter from the storm. 

Chapter 2 Meeting Him Again At Her Absolute Worst
Alexia slowly looked up and met a sharp, intense gaze. 

The streetlights flickered in the rain. Waylon Mason stood there, tall and intimidating, with a strong presence that made people uncomfortable. 

Behind him was a row of fancy cars parked along the street, catching everyone's eye. 

His assistants were standing on both sides of him, and one was holding an umbrella over his head. 

But the umbrella Waylon was holding was tilted just to cover Alexia. 

Waylon took a slow step forward and leaned in. Before she could react, his fingers reached up and removed the heavy, black-rimmed glasses from her face. 

Her bright, beautiful eyes were now fully visible. 

He looked down at her with a smirk. ""It's been years, Alexia. Look at you--what a mess. Did you finally stop being that love-crazy girl, or are you still dreaming useless dreams?""

Every word cut deeper. Alexia's eyes started to tear up, and the little bit of strength she had left broke down under his harsh voice. 

She opened her mouth to retort, but before she could speak, Waylon suddenly picked her up in his arms in front of everyone, protecting her from the rain and everything around them. 

He walked toward the black car waiting nearby, carrying her as the bodyguards quickly stepped aside to make way. 

All the noise and the rude comments around them faded away. 

Everyone just stood there, stunned, watching them leave with shock written all over their faces. 

...

Inside the car, Alexia held onto her muddy, soaked dress with trembling hands. 

She looked down, her voice rough. ""Waylon, why'd you have to show up now?""

Why now...when everything in her life was falling apart? 

Waylon tilted his head at her question, then reached out and took her chin in his hand, gently but firmly lifting her face. 

His voice was calm, yet carried a cold edge. ""Why else? I came to check on the woman I liked the least.""

His eyes darkened, a smirk playing on his lips. ""So, Alexia, do you remember what I said to you seven years ago?""

Of course she did. 

Waylon was the golden child of the Mason family. Her biggest rival back in the day. 

The last time they met was at the airport, seven years ago. What was meant to be a goodbye turned into their worst fight. 

Waylon always hated how she begged for the Jenkins family's approval and how she held onto Roger like she had no pride.

And she couldn't stand his ego and how he judged everyone she cared about.

Back then, he'd warned her clearly--chasing approval from people who'd never truly accept her would only end in disappointment, leaving her with nothing in the end. 

But she was too hopeful to see it. She had told herself, ""It's okay if they don't like me now. If I work hard and put them first, they'll accept me eventually.""

They wanted her to marry Roger, so she agreed. Her brothers didn't want her getting too powerful, so she acted clueless and average.

But behind the scenes, she was quietly taking out their threats and protecting both the Jenkins and the Gibson families. 

As Waylon's fingers held her jaw tightly, her warm tears fell on his hand, running down his knuckles.

His expression wavered. The coldness faded just for a second. Then, he let go. 

Alexia's voice shook, still raspy from the rain. ""Waylon, you were right. They tossed me aside after exploiting me. For more than twenty years, I gave them everything I had. I was so st**id.""

It was a long time before Waylon finally spoke again. ""You were not st**id. They just weren't worth it.""

But Alexia didn't respond. 

He turned to look at her and saw her fast asleep. 

Later that night, Alexia suddenly came down with a high fever. 

Santino Blake, Waylon's personal doctor, got pulled out of bed by a single call and had to grab his stuff and rush over late at night. 

With his years of experience, Santino quickly ran a full checkup. He stood by the bed, looking at Alexia's pale, tired face, and let out a soft sigh. 

Chapter 3 Our Luna Is Back
Santino glanced over his shoulder and caught sight of Waylon on the balcony, ci**rette burning slowly between his fingers. 

Sm**e curled up in lazy spirals, casting a ghostly veil over Waylon's sharp features, softening them with each exhale. 

Waylon rarely sm**ked. Santino could only recall one other time Waylon had smoked like this--two years ago.

Santino stepped outside and joined him.

""She's stable now. She just picked up a chill from being stuck in the rain and took the shock pretty hard. I've given her an injection and some medication--she'll be all right.""

A brief pause allowed Santino to scan the night sky.

""I checked the headlines. The Jenkins family didn't just cut her off; they humiliated her for everyone to see--right in the middle of Marilee's birthday party.""

Anger edged into Santino's voice. ""Hadn't they done a DNA test before taking her back from abroad? This whole thing smells like a setup.""

A sudden vibration broke his focus--Alexia's phone was buzzing on the nightstand. 

Waylon strode inside, intent on ending the call, but the name flashing on the screen stopped him cold. 

A flicker of something dark flashed across his eyes as he picked up and put on the speaker. 

Shouting erupted instantly, the caller's anger unmistakable. 

""Alexia, you've ignored every call and message. What exactly are you trying to pull? Faking your own disappearance won't help. Tomorrow, you're signing the divorce agreement, and that's the end of it. I've shown enough patience. Stop standing in the way of Marilee and me. You've lived off the Jenkins family long enough.""

""If you have any dignity left, walk away for good--it's the least you can do for Marilee. Don't worry about your share--you'll get what's coming. You looked after my grandmother and my mother these past years, fine. But don't overstep. Learn when to quit. Why aren't you answering me? Where are you?""

The stillness that lingered on the line finally made Roger uneasy. His confidence wavered and his words lost their edge. 

Santino internally begged for someone to step in and stop what was happening, feeling panic surge as things slipped further from control. 

From the moment Roger started speaking, Santino caught the way Waylon's face darkened. 

His eyes went cold and every hint of warmth vanished, leaving the atmosphere icy and suffocating. Santino could barely stand, knees threatening to give way. 

Waylon's expression turned sharp, his smile edged with cruelty. ""So that's the way you speak to her, huh?""

Every mu**le in Roger's body tensed, instincts screaming a warning. His voice grew cautious. ""Who are you? Where is Alexia?""

Waylon let his gaze settle on the b*d, where Alexia rested, her breathing faint but even.

His response came as a gentle murmur, almost lost in the tension. ""She's asleep.""

He let a short silence hang before adding, ""And she's right here with me.""

The only thing that answered him was the explosive sound of rage through the phone. Roger's voice thundered down the line. ""What did you just say? Who are you?""

Amusement glimmered in Waylon's eyes as a low chuckle slipped out. ""Relax. You'll figure it out...assuming you live long enough."" Without another word, he ended the call. 

By morning, the rain had vanished, leaving sunlight streaming through the windows as Alexia stirred awake. 

She reached for her phone, greeted by a storm of missed calls and furious messages from Roger. 

Without reacting, she scrolled through the flood of texts, then let the device drop onto the sheets. Right now, a hot shower mattered more. 

Steam fogged the bathroom mirror as she faced her reflection. Something had changed--her eyes, once dull, now held a spark she hadn't seen in ages. 

For the first time in ages, she tried out a smile, and this one actually reached her eyes, genuine and alive. 

It felt like a fever had burned away all her confusion, stripping her heart of old pain and fo**ish loyalty to those who never deserved it. 

No more playing the fool. No more pretending everything was fine. This sad story was over. 

Wrapped in a towel after the shower, she scanned her contacts and paused on a name untouched for years. 

Her call barely rang once before chaos exploded on the other end. 

""Luna! It's about d**mn time! Tell me--are the rumors true? You're finally getting a divorce?""

Laughter and shouting burst from the background, her friends making no attempt to hide their eavesdropping. 

Alexia replied calmly, ""Yes, I'm going to sign the divorce agreement today.""

Celebration roared through the phone. Whistles, cheers, the clink of glasses--her friends were clearly turning it into a full-blown party. 

""Took you long enough to snap out of that trance! No more housewife blues. Our Luna is back!""

""Divorce is the best thing to happen to you! Roger never deserved you. Say the word and I'll handle him myself!""

""And don't get me started on that overrated Jenkins family. If not for you, they'd have collapsed during last year's crash. Luna, we're ready when you are--the Helix Consortium stands with you.""

Their laughter and support brought a genuine grin to Alexia's lips. ""In that case, I need a ride.""

Without missing a beat, a man's voice broke in, buzzing with excitement. ""A ride? For your grand return? Name it. I'll send the reigning racing champion to pick you up!""

Chapter 4 Do You Believe Me
The call had barely ended when the soft click of the door caught Alexia's attention, her head snapping up. 

There in the doorway stood Waylon, his height casting a shadow, his expression giving nothing away as their eyes met. 

Neither of them had anticipated this kind of encounter. 

Fresh from the shower, Alexia's hair clung damply to her cheeks, a robe slipping low on her shoulders, skin flushed and eyes still hazy with warmth. 

That oversized bathrobe, threatening to slip further, revealed soft lines of skin; the faint scent of shampoo lingered in the air, sweet and impossible to ignore. 

Waylon's gaze swept over her, lingering just long enough for her cheeks to flush, before he looked away calmly. ""Get ready. Breakfast is on the table.""

Moments later, Alexia emerged dressed, met by the aroma of a beautifully arranged breakfast. 

Hunger won out over pride; she took her seat without pretense, finishing most of the meal before pausing for breath. 

Little was said as Waylon let her eat in peace, only breaking the silence after she'd nearly cleared her plate. ""You need a lawyer?""

She set down her coffee cup, eyes meeting his squarely. ""So you've heard.""

Amusement tugged at his mouth, though his eyes stayed cold. ""Is there anyone left who doesn't?""

Alexia tasted the bitterness of the coffee and grimaced for just a moment, though she quickly composed herself. ""I can deal with it.""

As the words left her mouth, she realized he might think she was too stubborn to admit she needed help. 

After all, in most people's eyes, women being dumped were pathetic. 

""Do you believe me when I say that?"" she asked. 

A smirk played on Waylon's face, eyes narrowing with a knowing glint. ""Why wouldn't I? Alexia, he's the one who should've fallen apart.""

That unwavering gaze held her still, though she managed a small, genuine smile in return. ""You've always known how to make a good point.""

Once breakfast was done, Alexia got ready to leave. 

Reaching the doorway, she stopped and glanced back. ""Thank you,"" she said quietly, her gratitude unmistakable. 

There was no chance she'd forget his kindness. 

...

Ten minutes had ticked past their appointment, and Roger's patience was quickly wearing thin as he and Marilee waited for Alexia in a private club. 

""Why isn't she here yet? Is she refusing to divorce you?"" Marilee pressed herself closer to him, sugar in her tone as she pouted. 

""You haven't forgotten our shopping plans, right? You promised you'd buy me a gown after this.""

Roger hummed in response. The weekend's banquet held by the Chamber of Commerce would be the perfect stage to introduce Marilee--the timing of her comeback couldn't have been more ideal.

Every influential name in town would be present, all eyes fixed on Waylon's much-anticipated return. 

Just thinking about Waylon sent a flicker of unease across Roger's face. 

The Chamber of Commerce's open support for Waylon right before the election of its new president wasn't exactly good news for the Gibson family. 

A sudden uproar near the doorway snapped Roger's focus. 

His head turned, and in that instant, it felt as though the atmosphere in the room shifted. 

Everyone's attention zeroed in on a single figure gliding inside with effortless grace. 

Alexia walked in, her crimson dress hugging every curve, heels whispering over the polished floor. Each stride radiated poise and quiet confidence. 

The scarlet hue, that unmistakable glow--she looked like the sunrise brought to life. 

With each step Alexia took, Marilee's smile grew tighter, until it disappeared altogether when Alexia claimed the seat across from them. 

Roger couldn't hide his shock either; his eyes remained glued to Alexia's artfully made-up features. 

""You..."" Words caught in his throat, visible in the small, nervous bob of his Adam's apple. 

Nobody present could believe this woman was the same person from last night--the awkward glasses, the baggy checkered shirt, the sopping hair. 

Yesterday's pitiful girl had been replaced by someone utterly different, confident, unrecognizable. 

Nothing about their surprise caught Alexia off guard. Her beauty wasn't news to her; she'd just chosen not to make a show of it. 

Childhood lessons had always emphasized modesty, staying out of the spotlight, never inviting too much notice. 

Marriage only tightened the leash. Years spent tending to Roger's grandmother and fielding disapproval from a mother-in-law who'd been fed tales of her so-called wild youth. 

Not even her hair or the color of her clothes escaped scrutiny. Every detail had been censored into drab submission. 

Vibrant dresses never made it to her closet--only baggy, forgettable options filled the shelves. 

That chapter, though, was behind her. 

With unhurried confidence, Alexia called over a server, ordered a te**ila, and began paging through the divorce agreement--unfazed by the attention. 

Marilee recovered her composure first, flashing a sweet smile.

""Alexia, I hope you're alright after yesterday. The reporters caught us all off guard. Someone told me you slipped in the rain. It must have been miserable out there.""

Chapter 5 Watching Her Unravel
Patience faded on Marilee's face as she waited for a reaction, but Alexia wouldn't even meet her eyes.

Instead, she directed her attention to Roger. ""Is the Gibson fortune going up in flames? This is all I'm worth?""

A shadow crossed Roger's face. ""That's what the prenup says, so that's all you're entitled to.""

Even before they got married, he'd closed every door to the family's fortune, making sure she'd never find a loophole. 

Realizing Alexia was blatantly ignoring her, Marilee butted in, ""You're getting more than enough, Alexia. Was it love or money you wanted from Roger, anyway?""

Alexia still refused to acknowledge her, not so much as a glance. ""With an amount this pitiful? Hang on to it--you'll need every last cent when the Gibson empire falls apart.""

Those words wiped any patience from Roger's face. ""Don't push it, Alexia.""

Suddenly, Marilee's eyes shimmered with tears and her voice went brittle, as though her heart might break. ""Please, Alexia, don't do this to Roger,"" she whimpered. 

The crowd's attention snapped toward her as sobs and sniffles filled the space. 

Marilee reached for the delicate pink diamond at her throat. 

""Maybe you never knew, but Roger and I have loved each other for years. He gave me this necklace on your wedding day--it's a symbol of his devotion. That cherry blossom garden in your backyard? Roger built it just for me, hoping I'd smile. You stole my life. Everything you have should have been mine. Don't you think it's time you let go and left quietly, without asking for more?""

An uncomfortable hush settled over the room. 

It was rare to see a mi**ress acting so brazenly, demanding the wife walk away with empty hands. 

Finally, Alexia turned to meet Marilee's eyes, her voice colder than ice.

""I stole your life? Was it me who went to the Jenkins family, begging them to accept me? Was I the one who refused a DNA test and strutted around calling myself their true daughter? Did I chase after Roger, desperate for a marriage?""

Every pointed question shattered the silence, each one sharp enough to cut. 

All color drained from Marilee's face, her body rigid beneath Alexia's icy stare.

Not missing a beat, Alexia delivered the final blow. ""Go blame your own fo**ish parents.""

That snapped the last of Marilee's restraint. ""If it weren't for them, you'd still be digging through ga**age. You've been living a luxurious life for twenty years. Without them, you'd be nothing but a pauper.""

A sharp laugh spilled from Alexia. Her gaze drifted to the faded needle marks on her wrist. ""If this is what luxury looks like, I must have missed out. Pain, though? There was always enough of that to go around.""

Disbelief filled Marilee's eyes, her words trembling with contempt. 

""Lies. You grew up surrounded by filth--you're nothing but ga**age. If my parents hadn't stepped in, you'd be gone by now. Some gang would have had its way with you and left you in the gutter--""

The rest never left her mouth. A sharp s**p rang out, echoing in the room. 

Stunned, Marilee pressed trembling fingers to the swelling red mark, speechless. 

A cold smile curved Alexia's lips.

""There's nothing I despise more than people who never learned basic decency. The Jenkins family or not, I'd still be standing here as myself. But you? Without that divorce agreement, you're nothing more than a shameless mi**ress.""

Not waiting for a reaction, Alexia hurled the signed divorce agreement straight at Marilee, landing the hit with brutal precision. ""Think of it as my parting gift.""

Marilee flinched as the edges nicked her forehead, letting out a startled cry. The shock left her shaking, the color draining from her lips. 

Alexia watched the panic unraveling Marilee's composure, noticing the nervous twitch on her face.

Pretending to care, she cocked her head and offered, ""Do you need me to call an ambulance for you?""

That question broke whatever restraint Marilee had left. ""Why would you ever do that?"" she snapped. 

Alexia gave her a look laced with fake concern. ""It just seems like you're not well at all.""

Marilee's voice cracked as she screamed, ""I am not sick!""

Even Roger turned, uncertain and uneasy as her shrill denial filled the room. 

Unbothered, Alexia let her reply drip with venom, hitting every nerve.

""Funny. People who are actually unwell always insist they're fine. Might be time to book yourself a session with a psychiatrist. And before I forget...cute necklace. But honestly? Junk stones aren't worth much these days.""

Marilee's face turned ashen, her fury and humiliation overwhelming her. Without warning, she collapsed straight into Roger's arms. 

Anger carved hard lines into Roger's face as he pulled Marilee close, glaring at Alexia.

""I never realized you could be so cruel. Just because you wore my ring, you think you can say whatever you want?""

Before Alexia could offer a comeback, a familiar voice cut through the tension, heavy with mockery. 

""Really? That's your angle? Just because she wore your ring, you think you could speak to her like that?""

A collective g**p swept through the crowd, all attention snapping to the doorway. 

There, tall and dangerously handsome, a man entered, charm radiating effortlessly with every step.

# Best Quart of Cream 2025: Expert Buying Guide

The humble quart of cream is a staple in many kitchens, serving as a versatile ingredient for everything from coffee and desserts to savory sauces and soups. Choosing the right quart of cream can significantly impact the flavor, texture, and overall success of your culinary creations.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of a quart of cream hinges on several crucial factors. These include its fat content, processing method, source of milk, and overall freshness. Understanding these characteristics empowers you to select the best cream for your specific applications.

**Fat content:** Fat content is the defining characteristic that differentiates various types of cream. Heavy cream typically contains around 36% fat, while whipping cream usually ranges from 30% to 35%. Half-and-half, a mixture of milk and cream, contains significantly less fat, generally between 10% and 12%. The higher the fat content, the richer and more stable the cream becomes when whipped or heated.

**pasteurization Method:** Pasteurization is a heat treatment process used to kill harmful bacteria and extend the shelf life of cream. Different pasteurization methods exist, each with varying effects on the cream's flavor and texture. Ultra-pasteurization (UHT) involves heating the cream to a very high temperature for a short time, resulting in a longer shelf life but perhaps impacting the flavor ever so slightly. Traditional pasteurization involves lower temperatures for a longer duration, often preserving more of the cream's natural flavor.

**Source of Milk:** The source of the milk used to produce the cream significantly affects its taste and quality. Cream derived from grass-fed cows is often richer and more flavorful due to the cows' diet. Additionally, the specific breed of cow can also influence the cream's characteristics. Some brands highlight the source of their milk and prioritize ethical and lasting farming practices.

**Storage and Packaging:** Proper storage and packaging are critical for maintaining the freshness and quality of cream. Cartons should be tightly sealed to prevent contamination and exposure to air. refrigeration is essential to inhibit bacterial growth and preserve the cream's texture and flavor.Some brands utilize specialized packaging designed to extend the cream's shelf life and protect it from light,which can degrade its quality.

**Additives and Preservatives:** Some quarts of cream may contain added ingredients, such as stabilizers or preservatives, to enhance their texture or extend their shelf life. While these additives are generally safe, some consumers prefer cream with minimal processing and no added ingredients. Reading the ingredient list carefully can help you choose a cream that aligns with your preferences and dietary needs.

**Organic Certification:** Organic certification indicates that the cream is produced according to strict organic farming standards, which prohibit the use of synthetic pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers. Organic cream is frequently enough perceived as being healthier and more environmentally friendly due to these practices. If organic sourcing is critically important to you, look for a quart of cream with official organic certification labels.

## Core Benefits

Choosing the right quart of cream offers advantages that extend beyond simple ingredient sourcing. The correct choice can streamline cooking processes, enrich flavors markedly, and ensure consistent results across diverse culinary applications.

**Enhanced Flavor Profiles:** A high-quality quart of cream elevates dishes by adding richness and depth. This is especially noticeable in sauces, soups, and desserts. The creamy texture and subtle sweetness creates satisfying culinary experiences that processed alternatives cannot match.

**Increased Stability in Cooking:** Cream with a higher fat content, particularly heavy cream, exhibits greater stability when heated, reducing the likelihood of curdling or separation. This makes it ideal for recipes that require prolonged simmering or high-temperature cooking, ensuring smoother and more consistent results.**Superior Whipping Performance:** heavy cream, when properly chilled, whips to a firm and stable consistency, making it ideal for topping desserts and creating decorative elements. The high fat content allows it to trap air effectively,resulting in a light and airy texture that holds its shape well.

**Versatile Culinary Applications:** The versatility of a quart of cream translates to efficiency in the kitchen. It can transition seamlessly from flavoring morning coffee to enriching savory dinner dishes. Its adaptability reduces the need for numerous specialty ingredients, streamlining cooking processes.

**Improved Nutritional Value:** While cream is high in fat, it also provides certain essential nutrients, including calcium and fat-soluble vitamins.Choosing cream from grass-fed cows can further enhance its nutritional profile by increasing the concentration of beneficial fatty acids, such as omega-3s.

1mhqo7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/mounjarouk/comments/1mhqo7z/3_weeks_inmy_story/,3 weeks in...my story,"Hey everyone, hope you're well.

3 weeks ago I took the plunge & picked up my first Mounjaro pen & started on Sunday 13th July at 10am. 

I was nervous about starting because like everyone Im sure the extremely low chance of dodgy side effects caused a reluctance in taking the plunge (literally). 

But at 240.8lb (I'm a 50yr old male at 6'2)  and not having the success in losing weight this year I had wanted, as well as some excellent advice from this forum & some private messages, I decided to do it anyway.

Here's my thoughts & experiences based on the first 3.1 weeks.

Day 1 - Didn't feel any different, was expecting to, but didn't eat over 1200 calories, wasn't sure if it was all in my head at this stage üòÇ but certainly wasn't hungry so that was nice.

Then, over the next 3 weeks I have lost a stone. 14 whole pounds which is beyond my wildest expectations & yes I am fully aware that losing weight fast can increase the chance if dodgy side effects. 

But so far, I have had zero negative effects. Not one. I don't feel hungry, I have eaten more protein, salad & fruit in the last 3 weeks than I genuinely have over the past 10 years (probably longer), drank more squash than ever before so have stayed hydrated and eaten VERY well in terms of healthy foods. 

I was concerned that, as a habitual eater (ie watch a film, eat chocolate, read a good book....have crisps etc) it wouldn't help me, because I often ate when I wasn't hungry, so worried that even with a reduced hunger it wouldn't change my mindset.

But oh my god it has, it's been incredible and I cannot really explain the difference. But I'll try anyway üòÇ

So for me, it has totally changed my relationship with food. As somebody with an incredible sweet tooth, and with a hunger that was relentless, so ce taking MJ I have still been peckish, have still really REALLY enjoyed my food, but it's enabled me to really make good choices, because immnever really hungry. It's changed how I feel hunger, and I do now think that if this is how ""normal"" or ""skinny"" people feel, then what a huge advantage they have!! 

It's football pre-season here in Wales too, and it's usually a time where I lose a stone or so between July-September as I am a qualified Referee so my exercise spikes in this period. But this year, I've reduced my calories, eaten exceptionally well & upped my exercise, and the weight has just melted away, but with exercise and a shit load of chicken (and protein in general üòÇ), I think I look great, and certainly feel more energetic & happy. 

It's beyond my wildest expectations, my sweet tooth has entirely disappeared (and apparently the sugar addiction I undoubtedly had previously would now be 'broken' so that's a long term benefits even if I come off) & I actually leave food now if I am full.

Honestly, my experience has been flawless to date.

I'm a week away from the 5mg pen, and I do wonder if I need to up the dose (even if it's recommended) because I don't want to fuck up what has been a perfect month & MJ experience to date. 

I hope some of you can advise on that & it may be that I still stick with 2.5ml ( half the clocks I presume?).

Oh, also, I've saved in food way more than the drug actually cost, I've enjoyed my food a lot more than ever before because I actually eat healthier making better choices, and even my coffee consumption has decreased quite dramatically as I've been drinking more squash and my caffeine addiction is less of an issue too!

So, that's me 3.1 weeks in. Right now, it's been quite literally, magic.

I grieved for all of them and while my backyard is now full of doggy graves its also full of the love and joyous memories I shared with each of those pups. Now that I think about it the man in my wall may have been trying to save my other dog from me taking them to the river but thats besides the point. I felt like I was ready for a new shot at being a responsible pet owner, so I went to the animal shelter (adopt don't shop!) and found an older stray. She's an adorable lab named Hannah who loves cuddles and treats. Only problem is that she barks backwards. I only realized it when she was in the yard one morning and a squirrel wandered in. It saw her and tried to jet away when she ran for it, but when she barked it sounded all fucked up and it looked like the squirrel was being rewound like in an old vhs tape. I was taking a sip of coffee at the time and I felt it slide back up my throat and into the cup. She caught the squirrel and I threw out my coffee cus now it had my stomach bile in it. And honestly I wouldn't mind this too much if she didn't do it on the drive to the park too cus I've already been in 3 pile ups on the freeway from it. I can't afford anymore Kia Rios. Can I train this behavior out of her? Should I reward her if she barks normally cus I don't want her to bark for treats all the time.

I wanted to write this because on my last night I didn‚Äôt trust my gut and booked a place I didn‚Äôt know know, had a very ‚Äòmeh‚Äô experience so I wanted to give kudos to the two places I know are good and will look after you - 

Plus Florence - 20-30 on the day if you don‚Äôt care about having your own room and just need a bed - incredibly clean, lovely process, great amenities. 

65-80 on the day for own room, absolutely brilliant and worth it. About 3-5eur cheaper on their own site than booking via the popular sites. 

Social Hub - both belfiore and lavagnini are good, and you can call me a boring old hipster but these hotels are great for the price. 75-90 on the day for a single room, 90-110 for a double, best quality shampoos I‚Äôve had in a hotel and they do cute freebies like a little water brick and decent coffee pods. If you become a member (luckily free) you get 15% off booking which is what I did to keep the price down. 

Both of these were around Strozzi-Fallaci which is pretty close to the main station and while the trams are temporarily a bit messy, still a decent location.

For Agriturismo - Casamatta in the bush above Florence was lovely as well, 70 for a double room and even though it looks like the whole place is run by a super young team, they get it all done well. Also - cats!üêà‚Äç‚¨õ ",3,1754342979.0,ItalyTravel,1,1.0,False

Pasture Birmingham nails the steakhouse experience with an upscale, lively vibe that feels both elegant and inviting. The interior has a sleek, Manhattan-inspired design with a standout feature: a massive glass-fronted dry-aging fridge alongside an open kitchen where you can watch the fire-based cooking in action.

Food-wise, this place is all about exceptional, locally sourced, pasture-fed beef cooked over open flame, which really elevates the flavor. Signature dishes like the Teriyaki Fillet and hefty porterhouse or tomahawk steaks get consistent praise for melt-in-the-mouth tenderness and subtle seasoning that lets the meat shine. Portions are generous, with flavorful sides and well-paired wines recommended by the helpful servers. Presentation is refined but not fussy, focusing on quality over gimmicks.  While prices are on the mid-to-upper range, the quality and experience justify it, positioning Pasture as a top-tier steak destination in Birmingham, perfect for date nights, business dinners, or special gatherings. It‚Äôs best to book ahead, especially on busy Fridays and Saturdays, as wait times can stretch. The buzz from foodies and social media is strong, with many celebrating it as a new benchmark for steak in the city, especially after the loss of other beloved steakhouses. If you‚Äôre craving a meat-focused meal with a lively atmosphere and stylish setting, Pasture is a solid bet.

Even an $1 fountain drink adds up because I'm not necessarily going to stick to one fountain/day. That's still $60/month if I drink two fountains/day. Yet in the moment, my brain is like ""But it's only $1"". If I bought generic two liters from Walmart which are also $1, that's about $30/month because as opposed to guzzling a fountain in about an hour, a two liter will last throughout the day. If I'm going to or ordering online from Walmart, I'm more likely to stick to what's on my list vs. walking into a gas station and grabbing whatever just because I see it. What I really need to do though is stop buying soda altogether and just use the coffee and drink mixes I have in my cabinet first.

Eating out, although I've cut back a bit the last couple of months. I used to eat out almost every day, but nowadays I do it 1-2 times/month if that. I had to cut back because of cholesterol and not only that, I've been using almost all of my non-bill money on computer parts. I have to remember that $5 Wendy's meal could be the difference between reaching vs. not reaching my goals.

Paying for streaming services I don't use. A few months ago, I paid for five streaming services and almost never watched any of them. They were the cheapest plans/bundles, but still added up to (I'm guessing) $40-50+ that month. That $50 could've been saved or paid for clothes.

The thing about ""In the moment"" spending is whenever you look back on it, you realize even the tiniest numbers altogether add up to a ginormous number. That $5 Wendy's meal is actually $150. Taking one of anything and multiplying it works with anything in life as far as seeing how big of a deal so-called ""small"" stuff actually is.

After the Divorce, She Can Have It All
After completing the divorce procedures with Juan for the 99th time, Susan Laurent walked out of the City Hall.

She thought she would rush to her best friend's house, get drunk and vomit violently‚Äîjust like she had done the first time Juan Parkston, her husband, filed for divorce. But then she remembered the doctor‚Äôs advice to take care of her health, so she simply made two cups of goji berries.

Returning home late at night to find Juan gone, she expected to spend the night scrolling through all his social media accounts, searching for any signs of infidelity‚Äîjust like she had done the 33rd time he filed for divorce. But she was so exhausted, she slept straight through the night instead.

When the servant asked her what she wanted for breakfast, she assumed she would starve herself and lose ten pounds‚Äîjust like she had the 66th time he filed for divorce. Instead, she ended up eating a table full of ‚ÄúManhattan Banquet.‚Äù

On the seventh day after the divorce, she suddenly remembered she had forgotten to ask Juan for reconciliation.

Juan had once stipulated that if a cold war between them lasted more than three days without reconciliation, their relationship would be over. So, she thought, like she had done the 98th time, she would send Juan a ‚Äúsmall essay‚Äù begging for reconciliation.

But Susan had barely sent him an emoji when Juan replied with a voice message, his tone languid, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll talk about withdrawing the divorce application when we have time. I stained Ashley‚Äôs underwear. Buy her a pair. 36C.‚Äù

Susan suddenly thought it might not be so bad to forget about it altogether. So she deleted the essay. She decided not to withdraw the divorce application.

Soon, Juan sent another message, [Susan, don‚Äôt forget your other identity. You only have half an hour.]

Susan closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Besides being Juan‚Äôs wife, she was also his assistant. She had to do what her boss asked. Because it was her job.

At one o‚Äôclock in the morning, almost every lingerie store was closed. Susan ran several blocks and finally found Ashley‚Äôs size, but was caught in a sudden downpour.

On the way, she fell and arrived at the hotel in a miserable state, her knees bloodied and mangled.

When she arrived, Ashley wore a thin, revealing silk nightgown that clung to her fair skin, her eyes brimming with a sultry charm.

‚ÄúSusan, please open the package before giving it to me. It‚Äôs all wet and filthy.‚Äù

She paused, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt mind me calling you that, do you? After all, you‚Äôre Juan‚Äôs assistant, here to deliver the underwear. Public is public, private is private.‚Äù

A sardonic smile flickered in Susan‚Äôs eyes. Private was private... It seemed Ashley hadn‚Äôt forgotten that they had once been close friends. But three months ago, her best friend and her husband had ended up in the same bed.

Susan‚Äôs voice was hoarse, each word measured. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù

She carefully opened the package, afraid the mud on her hands would dirty the underwear.

After receiving it, Ashley tore off the tag herself, but suddenly cried out, ‚ÄúThat hurts!‚Äù

Her finger had been scratched by the sharp tag, leaving a shallow mark. Not even a drop of blood.

Juan, who had just been smoking on the balcony, immediately put out his cigarette and pulled her into an embrace, his eyes full of concern.

‚ÄúHow can you be so careless? Susan, how can you be an assistant? You didn‚Äôt even clean the tag? You got Ashley injured!‚Äù

Susan felt a sharp pain shoot through her knee, her breath catching in the throes of it. If Juan had just lowered his head, he would‚Äôve seen the wound on her knee. But all he could see was the scratch on Ashley‚Äôs finger.

Juan frowned, his gaze filled with irritation and disappointment, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you even handle such a simple task?‚Äù

A thousand words caught in her throat, but Susan couldn‚Äôt speak. Juan‚Äôs anger at this moment wasn‚Äôt just disappointment in her work. Susan knew better than anyone else‚ÄîHe was disappointed in her as a person.

For years, she had clung to him like a lapdog, stifling him with resentment.

Susan had loved Juan since she was a child. She loved him so deeply that she gave up her pride for him and her affection was so obvious that everyone knew it.

She followed him through junior high and high school and studied hard to get into the same university. She announced to the world that she was his fianc√©e. Even though Juan never acknowledged it, she didn‚Äôt care. She was shameless enough to believe that she would marry him one day.

So, when Juan finally confessed his love, she felt as if all the fortune in the world had been poured into her lap. They dated, got engaged and got married...

Everyone said Susan had ‚Äúeverything she wanted.‚Äù She believed it too.

Until she caught Juan cheating for the first time‚Äîwith a female university student. She had been hysterical, but Juan simply smoked a cigarette and casually mentioned ‚Äúdivorce.‚Äù

They went through with it, but it was Susan who regretted it.

She cried and begged him, ‚ÄúCan you just live a good life?‚Äù

Juan touched her face and nodded calmly, ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

But she grew increasingly suspicious. And Juan never failed to meet those suspicions.

The first time, the second time... until the 77th time, when Susan discovered Juan‚Äôs affair was with Ashley‚Äîher best friend from college.

That day, she ended her business trip early and rebooked a flight home overnight, just to see Juan sooner. But her plane nearly crashed. She narrowly escaped death, crouching in a corner of the airport trying to call Juan‚Äîbut couldn‚Äôt reach him.

Braving the storm, she finally made it home, only to find her husband in bed with her best friend.

Amid the thunder, Ashley‚Äôs indifferent face suddenly became clear to Susan.

All the women Juan had cheated with bore at least five points of resemblance to Ashley. Perhaps Juan‚Äôs feelings for Ashley had been there far longer than she had realized.

That night, Susan had thrown a hysterical tantrum‚Äîbut it was all in vain. The outcome never changed‚ÄîShe had taken the initiative to withdraw her divorce application.

And so, Juan and Ashley became increasingly blatant. He even asked Susan to personally deliver Ashley‚Äôs underwear.

She seemed to have gotten used to it. Faced with Juan‚Äôs questioning, she even professionally pulled a Band-Aid from her bag.

‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôll be more careful next time.‚Äù

Juan had once instructed Susan to always carry Band-Aids. But Juan himself rarely got hurt. She never understood why.

Until one day, Ashley bought Juan black coffee and scalded her hand. Juan immediately pulled a Band-Aid from Susan‚Äôs bag.

That was when Susan finally understood everything.

Juan carefully bandaged Ashley‚Äôs finger. Then he casually tossed Ashley‚Äôs used underwear over Susan‚Äôs head.

‚ÄúHer hand is injured. Please help her wash it.‚Äù

Susan rushed into the bathroom in a panic. She clutched the damp underwear, staring at the evidence of Juan‚Äôs touch still on it. Her heart felt like it was being shredded apart, each breath heavy with pain.

Juan‚Äôs casual voice echoed from outside, ‚ÄúWash it and hang it up, then you can leave. I‚Äôll talk about canceling the divorce registration after I‚Äôm done with this. It depends on your performance.‚Äù

With her back to Juan, Susan finally closed her eyes, hot tears falling silently down her cheeks. No, there was no need to cancel it.

Juan, this time, I really want to divorce you.

After leaving the hotel, Susan did only two things. First, she submitted her resignation online.

Second, she called an old friend far away in a foreign country.

‚ÄúFrank, you said before that if I had nowhere else to go, I could always come see you. Is that true?‚Äù

Frank‚Äôs voice was hoarse, but the excitement in it was unmistakable, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always welcome.‚Äù

He paused, ‚ÄúBut if you weren‚Äôt madly in love with Juan, why would you suddenly want to leave him?‚Äù

Susan smiled bitterly, ‚ÄúThe cooling-off period for Juan and I still has 23 days left. Please buy me a plane ticket.‚Äù



Chapter 2

Susan let out a sigh of relief after receiving the flight booking confirmation from Frank.

Frank and she had been childhood friends, practically sharing a pair of trousers and he had harbored a crush on her for many years.

After she decided to marry Juan, Frank confessed his love and even said he wanted to elope with her.

After Susan turned him down, he moved all the family businesses abroad. She had thought they would never see each other again. But she hadn't expected...

A glint of mockery flashed in Susan's eyes as she began packing her belongings. She had spent the entire night going through her things, only to discover, somewhat comically, that the only luggage she could take with her had nothing to do with Juan.

It didn‚Äôt even fill a 24-inch suitcase.

She marked a red circle on her calendar. On the 6th of next month‚Äî22 days later‚Äîshe would finally obtain her divorce certificate.

Juan‚Äôs voice suddenly rang out, ‚ÄúThe 6th? Isn‚Äôt that the day our divorce takes effect?‚Äù

Before Susan could respond, he sneered, unable to conceal his sarcasm, ‚ÄúWhat? Are you worried I‚Äôll make you withdraw your divorce application before the 6th?‚Äù

Susan‚Äôs face paled and she was about to deny it.

Juan hurriedly turned and walked away due to a sudden call from Ashley.

Before leaving, he managed only to remind her, ‚ÄúRemember to come to the office today. I have something important to announce.‚Äù

Susan had originally planned to go to the company to finalize her resignation. But to her surprise, everyone there seemed genuinely delighted to see her.

‚ÄúSusan, congratulations! Now that the special assistant, Mr. Randall is leaving, it‚Äôs your turn to take over his position, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, our secretariat will be relying on you to look after us.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been with Mr. Parkston for so many years. If not for your contributions, you've certainly worked hard. If Mr. Parkston wasn‚Äôt so used to being taken care of by you, you would‚Äôve been promoted long ago. How could you still be where you are today?‚Äù

Susan was a little stunned. Was Juan really talking about this?

She couldn‚Äôt help but smile, then quickly waved her hand, politely insisting it was baseless.

But she knew better than anyone else that, apart from the poached Mr. Randall, she was the only one with both the qualifications and capability to handle the position of Chief Secretary.

But what a shame‚Äîshe was leaving.

At the morning meeting, Susan carefully prepared an 80-degree Americano with milk for Juan, adding six ice cubes.

Juan pushed open the door and entered. Always meticulous and unerring in his appearance, he even had a red rose pinned to his high-end black suit.

‚ÄúSusan, come here,‚Äù Juan said calmly, waving her over. ‚ÄúWhile everyone‚Äôs here, I have an announcement to make today.‚Äù

Colleagues close to Susan were already winking at her.

Someone joked, ‚ÄúSusan, don‚Äôt forget to treat us to dinner.‚Äù

Looking at Juan‚Äôs serious and determined gaze, Susan couldn‚Äôt hide her embarrassment but mustered the courage to refuse,

‚ÄúMr. Parkston, you don‚Äôt need to give the supervisor position...‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know?‚Äù Juan raised an eyebrow slightly, interrupting her with a hint of surprise. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve decided to give the position of supervisor of the secretarial office to Ashley. She‚Äôs new and doesn‚Äôt have much experience in the business. Please mentor her for the time being.‚Äù

Almost everyone was stunned. Susan felt as if a bucket of ice water had been poured over her head.

Ashley walked in, wearing ten-centimeter high heels and clutching a large bouquet of red roses.

‚ÄúPlease take good care of me, everyone,‚Äù she said triumphantly.

Everyone noticed the roses‚Äîidentical to the one on Juan‚Äôs chest. All the congratulatory smiles around Susan instantly turned to shock, curiosity and suspicion.

Her phone beeped. In a certain company chat room, everyone was engaged in a heated discussion.

[What‚Äôs going on? Mr. Parkston isn‚Äôt promoting Susan? Aren‚Äôt they still married?]

[You don‚Äôt know, huh? Susan earned the title Mrs. Parkston by clinging to him. She‚Äôs been chasing after Mr. Parkston since they were kids, even when he started working‚Äîinsisting on being his assistant. What man could put up with that?]

[I heard Susan‚Äôs divorcing Mr. Parkston because of Ashley?]

[Do you really believe she‚Äôll go through with it? Everyone knows she‚Äôs fought with Mr. Parkston 98 times and every time she‚Äôd end up tearfully begging him to take her back.]

[Stop talking. Look who‚Äôs in the chat room.]

All discussion came to an abrupt halt.

At that moment, Susan felt utterly exposed‚Äîlike she had been stripped bare and roasted on a scorching stove. She didn‚Äôt dare look up at Juan and simply stood there stiffly, forcing herself to sound professional.

‚ÄúYes, Mr. Parkston. I understand.‚Äù

Ashley stepped forward and intimately hooked her arm around Susan‚Äôs, speaking loudly in front of everyone, ‚ÄúSusan, go make me some coffee.‚Äù

She smiled sweetly, her voice edged with irony, ‚ÄúYou should remember what I like to drink, right?‚Äù

Of course Susan remembered. After all, they had once been close friends.

A sardonic smile flickered in her eyes and Susan nodded almost mechanically, ‚ÄúI remember.‚Äù

Ashley smiled with satisfaction. ‚ÄúWhen it‚Äôs ready, send it to Mr. Parkston‚Äôs office. I just have some work to report to Mr. Parkston.‚Äù

She had just assumed the supervisory position and didn‚Äôt even understand the business yet. What work could she possibly report?

Susan soon figured out what kind of ‚Äúwork‚Äù Ashley meant. From inside the room, Ashley‚Äôs unbearable groan echoed. Peeking through the door‚Äîwhich had been deliberately left ajar‚ÄîSusan saw Juan‚Äôs intense eyes as he pressed Ashley against the large office chair, kissing her fervently.

Ashley‚Äôs high heels had creased the leather of the chair. Susan couldn‚Äôt help but recall her first days as an assistant at Parkston‚Äôs.

She plopped down into her office chair. Juan, his face dark with anger, grabbed her arm and yanked her to her feet.

‚ÄúSusan, don‚Äôt bring your family affairs to work. Public matters are public, private ones are private. I hope you understand your place. I‚Äôm the president of Parkston Group. This isn‚Äôt the place for you to sit.‚Äù

Susan‚Äôs eyes reddened as she smiled faintly. So this was what Juan meant by separating public and private matters?

Leaving her brewed coffee at the door, Susan went straight to the HR department to submit a printed copy of her resignation letter.

The HR representative looked stunned. ‚ÄúSusan, are you really resigning? Does Mr. Parkston know?‚Äù

Susan replied calmly, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll find out soon.‚Äù



Chapter 3

Susan took the expedited resignation paperwork from HR and headed to Juan for his signature.

Before she could knock, Juan had already emerged, carrying Ashley in his arms and kicked the office door open.

‚ÄúCall 120! Ashley is having an allergic reaction!‚Äù he shouted impatiently, his face grim.

Susan lost her balance, stumbled back two steps and struck her lower back against the corner of the table. The sharp pain caused a cold sweat to break out on her forehead, but Juan didn‚Äôt notice.

He simply commanded her, ‚ÄúTake off your shoes. Give Ashley your flats.‚Äù

Juan gently removed Ashley‚Äôs sky-high heels, being careful not to hurt her. Then he casually tossed the heels at Susan. The sharp heel grazed Susan‚Äôs arm. Her face turned pale and her heart throbbed.

‚ÄúJuan, I can‚Äôt wear high heels.‚Äù

Susan had once broken her ankle while saving Juan. When he suddenly fainted, she rushed to protect the back of his head from hitting the floor. In the process, her own right foot had fractured. After she woke up, Juan had bought her an entire wall of flat shoes. His eyes had been solemn.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hurt yourself anymore.‚Äù

From then on, she wore only flats.

She had worked hard to protect herself. But now, Juan was asking her to give them away‚Äîto Ashley.

A flicker of irony crossed her eyes and Susan shook her head slightly. ‚ÄúYou know, my ankle‚Ä¶‚Äù

Juan interrupted, ‚ÄúThat happened years ago. It still hasn‚Äôt healed?‚Äù

His brow furrowed, his voice edged with impatience. ‚ÄúThen don‚Äôt wear any shoes yet.‚Äù

Susan froze, disbelief clouding her expression.

Juan, clearly out of patience, waved his hand. ‚ÄúHurry! Ashley‚Äôs condition can‚Äôt wait.‚Äù

His bodyguards shoved Susan onto the table and forcefully removed her flats. Barefoot on the cold floor, under everyone‚Äôs strange and curious glances, Susan felt as though a boulder was pressing down on her chest, suffocating her.

She didn‚Äôt know how long she had been sitting there. When she finally stood, staggering slightly, no one was around. No one had come to help her.

Clutching her resignation letter tightly, she hobbled off to find a pair of shoes.

The sun blazed overhead. The asphalt scorched her bare feet and blisters began to form. She was just about to pay for a pair when a familiar Lincoln pulled up beside her.

The door opened and Juan‚Äôs bodyguard tossed her inside.

‚ÄúSorry, ma‚Äôam. Mr. Parkston asked us to take you to the hospital.‚Äù

In the ward, Ashley‚Äôs face was swollen and flushed red, her eyes bloodshot. Juan sat on the sofa, his expression stony as he slowly rotated the Swiss watch on his wrist.

‚ÄúSusan, apologize to Ashley.‚Äù

Susan frowned in confusion. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúJuan, don‚Äôt be like this.‚Äù Ashley let out a self-deprecating laugh. ‚ÄúI took Susan‚Äôs position and I also stole her husband. I was wrong. I deserve to die. She put almonds in my coffee. I deserve it.‚Äù

Suddenly, she looked up‚Äîand with a loud slap, she hit herself across the face.

‚ÄúSusan, I‚Äôm just a disgusting mistress. You want me dead. I understand. But I just can‚Äôt control my heart‚Ä¶‚Äù She gave a bitter smile and gently shook her head. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. From today on, I won‚Äôt see Mr. Parkston again.‚Äù

With that, she threw back the covers and got out of bed. Her soft, pale feet stepped into the flat shoes that had once belonged to Susan.

Juan‚Äôs strong hands gently held her feet.

‚ÄúLie down peacefully.‚Äù His voice was gentle, full of tenderness.

But when he turned to Susan, only cold indifference remained. ‚ÄúSusan, I never intended to give you the supervisor position. With your capabilities, you‚Äôre truly unfit.‚Äù

Susan looked up in shock, her face draining of color.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre certainly good at taking care of me and you‚Äôre suited to being a good wife and mother, but do you really think you can manage an entire secretarial office? So Ashley wasn‚Äôt wrong in this matter.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs for what happened between her and me‚Ä¶‚Äù Juan scoffed, eyes brimming with mockery. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs already apologized to you. Shouldn‚Äôt you apologize for nearly killing her?‚Äù

Susan‚Äôs body turned cold. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do it.‚Äù

Ashley, looking wounded, teetered slightly. ‚ÄúSusan, the coffee cup showed a high concentration of almonds. Besides you, my best friend, who else would know about my allergy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI told you, I didn‚Äôt do it.‚Äù Susan closed her eyes, emphasizing each word.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough.‚Äù Juan had had it. He seized Ashley‚Äôs wrist and slapped Susan across the face.

Susan‚Äôs ears rang from the blow.

Juan said coldly, ‚ÄúAshley, you cared about sisterhood, but she nearly killed you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here now, so don‚Äôt be afraid. I‚Äôll get justice for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúHit me!‚Äù

Ashley struck Susan again. Once, twice, three times‚Ä¶ Susan was slapped herself ten times.

Her face became swollen and red, blood trickled from the corners of her mouth and the pain numbed both her body and her heart. Those ten slaps didn‚Äôt just teach her a cruel lesson‚Äîthey handed justice to Ashley. And they shattered the last remnants of love Susan held for Juan.



Chapter 4

Three days later, at Juan‚Äôs request, Susan accompanied him to a project event.

In the car, Susan finally submitted her resignation.

But Juan didn‚Äôt even glance at it; he simply signed. Susan instinctively asked, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you want to take a look?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just some unimportant documents you‚Äôve been assigned to handle,‚Äù Juan replied flatly, pinching his temple. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too lazy to read.‚Äù

Susan smiled and said nothing more.

When they arrived at the restaurant and sat down, Ashley plopped down beside Juan, who carefully poured her tea.

Mr. Chuck, a business partner, smiled and said, ‚ÄúIs this your wife? I‚Äôve heard a lot about you.‚Äù

Juan didn‚Äôt deny it but simply gave a faint smile. Susan quietly sat in the corner, feeling insignificant‚Äîtreated like a mere intern.

The middle-aged man next to her repeatedly took advantage of the situation by toasting her.

Juan seemed oblivious. He was preoccupied with shielding Ashley from drinking. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs allergic to alcohol and can‚Äôt drink,‚Äù he said.

Mr. Chuck looked displeased. ‚ÄúMr. Parkston, since we‚Äôre sincerely discussing cooperation and Mrs. Parkston isn‚Äôt drinking a single glass‚Äîisn‚Äôt that a bit disrespectful to me?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you want Mrs. Parkston to drink your glass of wine, fine.‚Äù Juan raised his eyelids and waved at Susan. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs my wife, Susan.‚Äù

The atmosphere at the table froze and almost everyone turned their eyes toward the corner. Juan had acknowledged her identity only to use her to shield Ashley from drinking.

But Juan had completely forgotten that Susan had given up alcohol long ago‚Äîafter drinking herself into gastric bleeding earlier that year to secure a project. Mr. Chuck placed a bottle of baijiu directly in front of her.

‚ÄúMr. Parkston, I specifically asked Miss Ashley to drink with me, but you wanted to change her,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSince we‚Äôre changing, then naturally the number of glasses must change as well.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis bottle‚Äîhalf for you and half for me. Isn‚Äôt that fair?‚Äù

Susan clenched her glass tightly and instinctively glanced at Juan. She hoped he would say something‚Äîanything‚Äîin her favor.

But all she saw was Juan‚Äôs indifferent face and concerned tone, ‚ÄúNext time there are occasions like this, always bring Susan with you. She‚Äôs quite the drinker.‚Äù

Susan smiled sadly and downed the entire bottle of alcohol in one go. Not for any noble reason, but because she‚Äôd followed this project for two years.

There were only a dozen days left before the divorce cooling-off period ended. She wanted to wrap up the project properly before leaving.

By the end of the drink, her stomach was burning and even Susan‚Äôs breath smelled of rust and blood. But without anyone telling her to stop, she didn‚Äôt dare. She drank cup after cup, her vision spinning, until she finally couldn‚Äôt hold back and vomited violently.

Amidst the filth, a glaring red pool appeared.

Everyone panicked. ‚ÄúSusan, are you okay? You‚Äôve been drinking until you vomited blood!‚Äù

Finally, Susan saw Juan‚Äôs expression change drastically. He suddenly stood up and rushed toward her.

A colleague grabbed Susan‚Äôs arm, eyes filled with helplessness.

‚ÄúSusan, tell me‚Äîyou're about to resign. Why are you drinking like this?‚Äù

‚ÄúResign?‚Äù Juan‚Äôs voice suddenly exploded from behind. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean by resign?‚Äù

Susan was forced to look up, meeting Juan‚Äôs dark, stormy gaze.

His face was livid. ‚ÄúSusan, are you resigning?‚Äù

Susan was terrified and instinctively concealed the truth. ‚ÄúNo. He got the wrong person. It‚Äôs another assistant who‚Äôs resigning.‚Äù



Chapter 5

Juan‚Äôs brow furrowed, but before he could press further, the door suddenly burst open.

Ashley appeared‚Äîher hair disheveled, her slip dress torn, revealing a glimpse of her body. Her eyes were red and filled with tears, making her look pitiful.

‚ÄúJuan, save me!‚Äù she screamed. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs trying to rape me!‚Äù

She collapsed into Juan‚Äôs arms, trembling and feverish.

‚ÄúMy water was drugged. If I hadn‚Äôt stabbed myself, I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to face you again!‚Äù

Juan then noticed the shallow cut on Ashley‚Äôs palm. Blood flowed and his expression darkened with rage.

‚ÄúWhat are you all standing there for? Go catch them!‚Äù

Juan immediately tore off his shirt, cut pieces of white cloth with scissors and wrapped them around Ashley‚Äôs wound.

Susan still remembered that shirt. It was the one Juan had worn at their wedding‚Äîa limited edition, high-end model she had purchased after traveling through countless countries. He‚Äôd said he would cherish it. Now, he had destroyed it with his own hands.

Susan lowered her eyes, hiding the glint of mockery within them. The alleged culprit was dragged in by the bodyguards and thrown at Ashley‚Äôs feet.

Ashley screamed in fear. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs him! It‚Äôs him! He almost ruined my innocence!‚Äù

The man was doused with a bucket of ice water, snapping him out of his drunken state. After realizing what had happened, he collapsed, pale and horrified.

‚ÄúI‚ÄîI‚Äôm innocent, Mr. Parkston! I was drugged and I lost control of myself. It was this bottle of liquor. After I drank it‚Ä¶‚Äù

Suddenly, he straightened up and pointed at Susan, ‚ÄúIt was her! It was this woman who drugged Miss Tisdale and me‚Äîand had someone lock us in the same room. She did all this on purpose!‚Äù

At that moment, Juan trembled, his hawk-like gaze narrowing on Susan. Her stomach churned and she remained slumped on the floor, stunned.

Looking up, she met Ashley‚Äôs half-smile‚Äîsinister and cold‚Äîand instantly understood everything.

This was another trap.

In fact, there were many details that pointed to Susan‚Äôs innocence. But Juan didn‚Äôt believe her.

So, no matter what she said, it was a capital crime.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you have anything to say?‚Äù Juan looked down at her, his voice laced with disappointment. ‚ÄúSusan, you‚Äôre a stranger to me right now.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo avoid divorcing me, you‚Äôve resorted to such disgusting tactics. Have you ever considered how Ashley will cope after you‚Äôve ruined her innocence?‚Äù

Susan was drenched in cold sweat from the pain. She had no strength to argue. She closed her eyes, exhausted.

‚ÄúWhatever you think,‚Äù she said in a low voice.

Juan flung everything off the table with a deafening crash. His eyes blazed with terrifying rage.

‚ÄúWell, even after all this, you still don‚Äôt repent. In that case, let‚Äôs give her a taste of her own medicine! Come on‚Äîpour all this liquor into her stomach!‚Äù

Susan froze, staring at Juan in disbelief, almost questioning her own sanity. She had already bled from her stomach. To vent his anger over Ashley, he actually tried to force more laced liquor into her body?

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Susan rasped, shaking her head. ‚ÄúJuan, I‚Äôll die‚Ä¶‚Äù

Susan‚Äôs mouth was pried open. No matter how hard she struggled, she couldn‚Äôt stop the burning liquor from flooding into her stomach. She spat blood against the wall before collapsing into unconsciousness. Her last sight was Juan‚Äôs retreating back, walking away without the slightest hesitation.

Susan couldn‚Äôt help but smile in despair and wondered in silence, Juan, do you really love me? If you do, would you truly be willing to treat me like this?



Chapter 6

Opening her eyes, Susan felt a pair of rough hands groping her. Someone covered her mouth and a sharp slap across her face made her ears ring. ""This woman is really something. If she hadn‚Äôt been drugged, how would we have gotten our turn?""

Susan then realized the primal desire surging within her body. She couldn‚Äôt help but curl up. Her eyes bloodshot, she bit down hard on the man‚Äôs hand. With a loud crack, he slapped her again.

""Easy! Mr. Parkston told us to play around, not kill her!""

Hearing that, a chill ran down Susan‚Äôs spine. It was him. It was actually him... Susan couldn‚Äôt help but laugh softly, tears streaming down her cheeks.

As the sickening stench hit her face, Susan steeled herself and rammed her head into him. She somehow found the strength to tear off the rag covering her eyes, grabbed a nearby vase and smashed it over the man's head with all her might.

Before bolting from the room, Susan caught a glimpse of a familiar face. She remembered that man. He was Ashley‚Äôs cousin.

Stumbling home in a disheveled mess, Susan couldn‚Äôt wait to tell Juan the truth. But as she approached, the frantic sounds of breathing and groaning sent her spiraling into a whirlwind of despair.

""No, no more..."" Juan‚Äôs voice was hoarse, frantic and lost in confusion. ""No more? Didn‚Äôt you ask me to help you with the antidote?""

Susan stood frozen, stunned, feeling like the whole situation was beyond absurd. Her husband was administering the antidote to another woman, while she had just barely escaped a horrifying assault.

She no longer expected Juan to help her uncover the truth. For the next ten days, she reviewed surveillance footage, called the police and received treatment for her injuries at the hospital. She handled everything on her own.

One by one, she tore off the calendar pages. The date of her divorce approached closer and closer.

Finally, with only seven days left before her departure, Susan gathered all the evidence. She was determined to clear her name before she walked away for good.

She returned to the villa and laid everything out in front of Juan, ""Juan, it wasn‚Äôt me who drugged her that night. It was Ashley‚Äôs cousin.""

Unexpectedly, she was met with suffocating silence.

Ashley‚Äôs body went limp, her expression shifting through confusion and disbelief. ""How is that possible?""

Susan pointed at her face, her voice trembling with fury. ""Ashley, don‚Äôt pretend. You conspired with your cousin and let him do this to me...""

Before she could finish, Juan cut her off impatiently, ""So what?""

Those two simple words, cold and dismissive, struck Susan like a blow to the chest. Her eyes widened in disbelief before tears spilled over.

""I‚Äôm going to call the police. She framed me. Slandered me. I can‚Äôt let this go.""

Ashley began to sob, her voice trembling. ""Susan, you misunderstood. I really don‚Äôt know anything! My cousin‚Äîhe just wanted to help me. He acted on his own... Juan, he did this for my sake. Please, don‚Äôt hurt him, okay?""

""I only have this one brother. If anything happens to him, I won‚Äôt want to live anymore!"" Ashley said, ready to slam her head against the wall.

Juan pulled her into his arms. His expression darkened and he nearly roared, ""Enough! Don‚Äôt you just want to divorce me? Why are you making up so many excuses to mess with me?""

Juan closed his eyes and let out a sharp breath, ""Fine, I promise. As long as you stop stirring things up, I‚Äôll go with you to cancel the divorce registration in a few days. Is that okay?""

He looked as if he was conceding everything.

But Susan only sneered, ""What if I insist on suing?""





Chapter 7

A flash of disgust crossed Juan‚Äôs eyes, ""Then I‚Äôll send Ashley‚Äôs cousin abroad before you do.""

He turned to Ashley with unwavering tenderness, ""Don‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt let anything happen to your cousin.""

""Take her. Lock the lady in the basement first. No one is to let her out without my permission!""

Susan stumbled as the bodyguard dragged her away, slamming her against the wall. She let out a burst of hollow laughter, tears slipping freely down her face.

Before being shoved into the basement, Juan caught sight of her devastated expression‚Äîand a sharp pang pierced his heart. He opened his mouth, as if to say something more.

But Ashley had already taken his hand. ""Juan, let‚Äôs take my cousin to the airport now, okay?""

Juan looked away, unable to dwell on the strange heaviness rising inside him because of Susan.

She loved him so deeply. She had always forgiven him. Just like how she had forgiven his 99 betrayals.

In reality, Susan had always been terrified of cramped, dark environments. Once, in an attempt to save Juan from a kidnapping, she had been held captive in a cellar for an entire week‚Äîbeaten and verbally abused‚Äîleaving her in unbearable pain.

Juan had known she was afraid of the dark, of confined spaces. Still, he had stuffed her into that dark, damp basement.

Susan curled up in a corner, her eyes so dry she couldn‚Äôt even shed a single tear. It was as if she had become completely numb to the pain Juan inflicted on her.

And so, in the basement, Susan counted down the days, enduring the torment. Six days, five days, four days... She was terrified of missing her flight.

Luckily, with only three days left, the basement door finally opened. A pair of ten-centimeter high heels appeared before Susan. Ashley looked down at her, eyes brimming with mockery.

""Susan, you're so shameless. Even after all this, you're still thinking about withdrawing your divorce application from Juan? Do you really want to be his dog?""

She reached out and thrust an electric baton into Susan. The searing pain nearly took her breath away. She collapsed to the ground, eyes bloodshot, yet no tears came.

Hearing all this, she remained strangely calm, even managing a faint smile, ""Ashley, is Juan really that good to you?""

Ashley sneered, ""You should know better than I do, right? Otherwise, you wouldn‚Äôt have clung to Juan for so many years. It‚Äôs not him who‚Äôs so amazing‚Äîit‚Äôs the mighty Parkston Family behind him.""

Ashley bent down and jabbed the baton into her again.

Susan's face turned ghostly pale from the pain, ""Soon, everything will be as you wish.""

""Ideally,"" Ashley scoffed. ""After all, from beginning to end, Juan‚Äôs heart has only ever belonged to me.""

Susan froze. Her eyes widened as a chill spread through her body, ""What do you mean?""

""Oh, so you didn‚Äôt know!"" Ashley covered her lips, feigning surprise.

""You chased Juan for years and he never said yes. Did you never wonder why he suddenly confessed to you in college? Of course, it was because he wanted to confess to me!""

Ashley laughed triumphantly, ""It‚Äôs a pity that back then, I didn‚Äôt realize how important the Parkston Family would be to me, so I rejected him. I never thought that, out of spite, he would turn around and confess to you‚Äîand even marry you!""

A low thunder rumbled from above, as if the world cracked open. All the strength in Susan‚Äôs body vanished. Her eyes turned bloodshot. She sprang to her feet, shoved Ashley aside and bolted upstairs.

No. Impossible!

Juan had clearly liked her. He clearly had feelings for her.

Susan rummaged through her closet and finally found the glass bottle filled with paper cranes‚ÄîJuan‚Äôs gift when he confessed his love.

With a crash, she smashed the bottle, the flying shards slicing her skin. Susan, completely oblivious to the pain, crouched down like a madwoman, picking up each paper crane and unfolding them one by one.

[Ashley, I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.]

[Ashley, you're so adorable when you're angry.]

[Ashley, there's really nothing between Susan and me. Don‚Äôt misunderstand.]

Susan had treasured these confessions to Ashley like precious tokens, hoarding them for a full ten years. She was truly ridiculous.

Her entire body trembled uncontrollably as she let out one mournful laugh after another. Finally, two lines of tears streamed from her eyes, washing away the dryness‚Äîtears of anguish and devastation.



Chapter 8

Susan didn‚Äôt know how long she had cried.

After nightfall, she swept up the shattered glass on the floor like a ghost, then tossed all the paper cranes into the brazier, watching them burn to ash.

Once everything had turned to cinders, Juan pushed the door open and walked in. He was carrying Ashley in his arms, his expression full of fury.

""Susan, look at you!""

Susan stared at him without expression, even managing a faint smile, ""Mr. Parkston, may I ask what I‚Äôve done?""

Juan felt a stab in his chest. ""What‚Äôs with that tone? To escape from the basement, you actually knocked Ashley unconscious and left her lying there alone all afternoon!""

Susan stared at him blankly, ""Is that what Ashley told you? Whether I knocked her unconscious or not, you could‚Äôve asked the servants. Mr. Parkston, to protect Ashley, you even argued over something so trivial. Can‚Äôt bear to see her hurt?""

Juan‚Äôs chest heaved with anger, his eyes burning coldly, ""You think I didn‚Äôt ask?""

Before Susan could react, a servant stepped forward.

""Mr. Parkston, I saw it myself. It was Madam who injured Miss Tisdale.""

""Yes, yes. She even used a stun gun on Miss Tisdale!""

One of them even dropped to their knees while saying, ""Madam, please stop being so stubborn. Don‚Äôt you want to cancel your divorce registration with Mr. Parkston? If you keep acting like this, he might never forgive you!""

Susan stared at them, eyes filled with disbelief. But all she felt was an overwhelming emptiness. She had always treated them kindly. In the end, they were nothing more than sycophants. Susan no longer had the strength to argue.

She simply closed her eyes and smiled faint, ""What would you have done if I had done it?""

Juan immediately raised his hand and slammed it against the door, veins bulging across the back of his hand.

""Susan, you‚Äôve disappointed me so much! Bring in the family discipline!""

His eyes were bloodshot, his voice like a growl, ""She‚Äôs not allowed back in this house until she‚Äôs been lashed a hundred times!""

With a sharp crack, agony tore across Susan‚Äôs back.

The saltwater-soaked whip landed mercilessly, ripping her skin open, leaving blood and torn flesh in its wake. Yet Susan didn‚Äôt utter a single cry. She endured it until her entire body was soaked in sweat, as if she‚Äôd just stepped out of a storm. She fainted, woke up and fainted again‚Äîhovering near death.

When she finally regained consciousness, she was already in a hospital room.

The first thing Susan did was glance at the time on her phone.

It was the 6th.

She thought vaguely to herself, soon, I can leave‚Ä¶

Juan took her hand in his, his voice softening, ""Susan, as long as you don‚Äôt try to harm Ashley again, I can go with you to cancel the divorce.""

Susan closed her eyes, her expression calm, ""Okay.""

Juan added, ""After all, you‚Äôve been married for years and you and Ashley are close friends. There‚Äôs no need to make things so tense.""

Susan responded again, ""Okay.""

She looked so quiet, so obedient.

A strange feeling stirred in Juan‚Äôs heart. He frowned, about to speak again.

But suddenly, the phone rang loudly and Ashley‚Äôs voice filled the room, ""Juan, I‚Äôm having another nightmare. Where are you? I want to see you. You know I was locked in the cellar for a week...""

Susan‚Äôs eyes shifted slightly, a flicker of confusion crossing them, ""Cellar? She also‚Ä¶""

But before she could finish, Juan had already let go of her hand and rushed out.

Watching Juan‚Äôs Lincoln disappear into the distance, Susan, despite the stabbing pain in her body, she changed into casual clothes and headed to the City Hall.

Juan had completely forgotten that today marked the end of their one-month cooling-off period. He would never need to accompany her to cancel the divorce registration.

This time, they were truly divorced.

After receiving the divorce certificate, Susan mailed Juan‚Äôs copy to him.

She also enclosed her resignation letter, along with all the evidence she had gathered proving Ashley‚Äôs slander and false accusations.

She made a copy of the evidence and asked a friend to report it to the authorities.

Once everything was settled, Susan boarded a plane to a foreign country.

Before takeoff, she sent a text to Frank, [I‚Äôm leaving. Landing in twelve hours.]

Then, with a cold and steady gaze, Susan snapped her SIM card in half without hesitation. She vowed never to return to the Parkston Family again.

The night was as dark as ink. As the plane soared into the sky, she saw the stars twinkling.

She knew that it was guiding her to pursue a better self.

The Familiar ‚Äì Part One 

The first time I saw him, it was a Friday evening.
I opened the door, and he was stuck to the ceiling‚Äîarms and legs spread like a spider‚Äîstaring at me with bulging, blood-red eyes.

Strangely, I wasn‚Äôt afraid. It felt like I had known him forever.
Like he was no more surprising than a housecat I‚Äôd had for years.
From that day on, he was always with me.
In the car. On the street. At the office.
He‚Äôd appear out of nowhere, sometimes even arriving before me.
I knew no one else could see him.

He was a strange, imaginary creature.
A triple-pronged tail, long leathery tongue, rough skin like horn, clawed fingers.
Not scary, exactly‚Äîmore absurd. Laughable, even.

His size changed constantly‚Äîsometimes as small as a mouse, sometimes as big as a crocodile.
Once, I saw him shrunk down, hanging from the chandelier like a bat, watching TV.
His shadow on the wall startled me at first‚Ä¶ but then I saw him and couldn‚Äôt help laughing.
He didn‚Äôt like that.

He immediately leapt onto the coffee table, grew into a giant lizard, and glared at me like he was offended.

Up until yesterday, I‚Äôd never seen him eat anything.
But yesterday, through the restaurant window, I saw him leap off my car hood, reach into a filthy gutter, and pull out a fat rat.
He held it up, studied it curiously, and then stuffed it sideways into his mouth.



---

The Familiar ‚Äì Part Two 

I had never really stopped to wonder what he was.
Or where he came from.
Or why I was stuck with him.

Maybe because he didn‚Äôt hurt anyone.
He was like an old, weird piece of furniture in the house.
But lately, something had changed.
He had started doing things he never used to.

Just this past week, early one morning, I saw him crouched in a tree, staring intensely.
I looked down.
A cat was stalking a few sparrows fighting over breadcrumbs.
Moments later‚Äîdead silence.
No cat.
No birds.

He was still there, drinking stale water from the garden pool.


---

I grabbed my file and headed out.

At the bus stop, the bus pulled up.
He was sprawled flat across the roof, his belly pressed down, limbs dangling like some dead thing.

When I boarded, he slid down, belly-crawled along the ceiling, and dropped inside.
Sometimes he‚Äôd hang from the poles like a sloth, staring straight into the passengers‚Äô faces.

He crept into the women‚Äôs section.

As soon as he locked eyes with a baby in its mother‚Äôs arms, the child screamed and burst into tears.

He panicked and scrambled up front toward the driver.
He watched the driver's hands‚Äîthe gear shifting, the buttons, the levers.
Absolutely fascinated.

When we reached the next stop, he beat the driver to it and hit the door button.
The doors opened.

The driver stared at the dashboard, baffled.


---

The office was as crowded as always.

When it was finally my turn, I handed my file to the clerk.

She glanced at it and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre missing a document.‚Äù

I said, ‚ÄúThis is my fourth time here. Every time, you ask for a different paper.‚Äù

Voices were raised.

A man with a beard and tight collar stepped out from the back and said,
‚ÄúSir, please don‚Äôt waste people‚Äôs time. Go get your file in order and come back.‚Äù

I had no choice. I left.

As I turned to the stairs, a strange thought hit me:
If only he would show up right now, right in front of this woman and her boss.
I imagined the scene‚Äîand chuckled to myself.

Just then, I saw him.

He was behind the glass, sitting beside another clerk, staring at her monitor.

Every time she pressed a key, he mimicked her motion with his long, clawed fingers.

Moments later, the woman stood up and said:
‚ÄúThe system‚Äôs frozen. Everyone please wait.‚Äù

A wave of groans spread across the room.


---

When I got home, I was drained.
Flopped onto the couch for a nap.

But the neighbor‚Äôs dog started barking again.

We had complained a dozen times.

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, this is an apartment building, not a kennel.
At least don‚Äôt leave him out on the balcony.‚Äù

She never listened.

The barking went on.
It was impossible to rest.

Then‚Äîsuddenly‚Äîit stopped.
Halfway through a howl.

I got up, stepped onto the balcony.

The leash was still tied to the railing.
No collar.
No dog.

I looked down.

He was crouched beside the garden pool, drinking from the algae-covered water.
He looked up at me with those glowing red eyes‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶then leapt straight up onto my balcony.

1mhq9da,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1mhq9da/closure/,Closure,"There‚Äôs an important full moon in Aquarius coming up this week. And the theme is freedom. 

I‚Äôve been in this polarizing battle in my head about love. 

I fell for a few different people that I‚Äôd call soulmates. And I was able to alchemize because that‚Äôs what I believe in-love. And fairness and balance. 

Power, Freedom, Grace, Imagination, Vulnerability? Stability, Trust? What do people desire? What do people value?

I met this woman. She‚Äôs been on my mind for so long. And I need to let it go and make peace with the whole thing. It‚Äôs taking up too much energy, I need to be free so I can focus on mundane astrology, geopolitics, going back to school again and building something new. I‚Äôve had the hardest time letting this one go because I felt my guru between us. When I first met her I made a joke about ‚Äúwhat is life without coffee?‚Äù She thought about it and said ‚Äúslower‚Äù. I knew right then she was special. She didn‚Äôt brush off the question, she actually contemplated it and came up with a real answer. The thing I loved was the look on her face when she was internally processing what her answer would be. I was like, that was charming and adorable. I didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd get the feels for her yet. I just knew she wasn‚Äôt like everyone else and I really liked that. 

Much further on we were having a brief conversation about the collective. And I saw her in my minds eye as what I later understood to be Eros. I saw her as the golden flower, the divine feminine, the Buddha, and the numinous ineffable light of the mind. (I didn‚Äôt know Eros/Psyche myth until much later. I discovered we had that asteroid astrology, and I just assumed it was a love story without reading the myth. And what did I end up doing? I did the thing Psyche does that drives Eros away. Because I am dumb and I didn‚Äôt do my research properly.) And yet the activation of the myth sent me on an incredible healing journey. By the time I understood what was happening I was already well into the 4th task. Each task was a different Eros helping me heal. And I‚Äôm at the end of the story now. 

I failed the 4th, which is out of order but it‚Äôs the freedom one. It‚Äôs so hard to let her go because she was the numinous one. I felt safe with her and I love her like I love my guru. She‚Äôs perfect. Even her ego and her temper. I lowkey love it. And that‚Äôs probably idealization to some degree on my part, but it‚Äôs also that when she walked into the room she made my heart smile just by being herself. I was able to *see* her more clearly than I‚Äôve ever seen anyone else. 

She walked in once and I glanced over at her, and I saw her as this cute punk rock girl with soft lavender colored hair, a bunch of piercings, a leather jacket and a massive zero fucks attitude. I realized she was not a conformist in the slightest. She‚Äôs more progressive and anti-establishment than I am. It made me laugh because I did not expect that from her. She‚Äôs more polished and serious externally but she‚Äôs got a punk rock side of her heart for sure. The other thing I saw was my guru was shifting her from a black/white animus to one of the soul. Also, her Maharaji lives in an infinite library. I also really love how kind and sensitive she is to everyone. There‚Äôs a wisdom and compassion in her that I don‚Äôt have a word for, it makes me feel a kind of way. It‚Äôs a soul longing kind of way. Like her soul is so beautiful it feels like that silence, kailash, that psyche has for Eros. 

Last week I found out there‚Äôs a Hanuman asteroid. I looked up our charts. Her Hanuman is conjunct her Eros, Mercury and Pholus in her chart. Of course she has a passion for learning, and of course I‚Äôd fall for her because Hanuman is there. 

In my chart Hanuman is conjunct my Sun, conjunct her progressed Chiron, and my Psyche is between her Eros/Chiron with composite Hanuman there. 

Her Sun and my Mercury/Psyche are conjunct Regulus. And my progressed Hanuman is there. I knew what I felt, and I still do. 

(Astrology, like any other divination technique is a mirror for the subconscious and intuition. Or maybe we live in a simulation. Or both. Who knows? Maybe imagination and intuition is our way of accessing information and health/healing without having to worry about education systems and bypassing the constraints of language. Also, the collective consciousness is alive with a much deeper and connected numinous energy that we‚Äôre ready to accept. We (our egos) are like a bunch of dead sailors floating on an ocean of living light. Life is death and death is life. Or some combination of both. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some philosophical tantra in there‚Ä¶)

Anyway, I‚Äôve used this dynamic to exam what love is. And I realized that I‚Äôm possessive and controlling in love because I don‚Äôt trust it to stay. And I am the one that needs to change that pattern in love. Love has nothing to do with whether someone chooses to stay or go, if they choose me or someone else. It‚Äôs not black and white. I‚Äôm the one that needs to evolve my ideas and perspective of love. 

She chose someone else, and tbf he was there first. The battle I‚Äôm fighting internally is about me not her. I can love me and love her at the same time without having any power or control over the outcome. Do I need to lose myself to this? No, my self worth and self respect have kicked into gear. I‚Äôm not going to do sad girl longing love, carrying some eternal flame at the expense of my own happiness. But it is possible that I can be a whole individuated person, and have experienced twin flame divine union. And I can give her and me our freedom, her and I can both be with other people and I can still love her. Like my guru says ‚Äúyou just love‚Äù. And because it‚Äôs Hanuman between us I don‚Äôt have to try. It just is, it always has been that way. I just have to get my ego and moody temper out of the way. My moodiness and bitterness are my ego not getting what it wants. It‚Äôs always the ego that blocks the flow of love. The purest love I have to give is the one I‚Äôm giving her and me, pretty much by the grace of my guru and Hanuman. 

My progressed Eros is almost a full degree away from my natal Chiron. I‚Äôll be ok. Time and perspective heal, and my Eros is in Taurus: slow and steady win the race. It‚Äôs about quality not quantity. Transit Uranus (and Neptune) has been electrifying my Chiron/Eros and Lilith/Uranus and Mercury/Psyche. Like Frankenstein being electrocuted into life those placements have been too. 

It‚Äôs time to let go by the grace of my guru. She‚Äôs the spiritual love of my life. Beauty and the Beast meets Inception meets Imagine Me and You; meeting on a Lunar eclipse and having our story constellated through the collective on the eclipses and the 90 day eclipse midpoints. Even our chart by Davison is a boomerang yod of Eros, Psyche, Mercury, Zeus, with Jupiter and Ambrosia at the base of the yod. By Composite Venus/Asc, Moon/Dsc, Uranus/Saturn IC, Eros on the MC in Gemini. A grand cross on the angles-the power of a steering wheel on the collective and public image represented by Eros. Just incredible charts. I‚Äôve never seen anything like it. With Hanuman, anything is possible. 

A love worthy of the Gods, at Kailash, by the grace of the Hindu gods constellated in the collective in true Leo fashion. Even Osho said Kailash is the mystical library. I think she‚Äôd like that. I just like the sacred silence. Where Eros and Psyche find a love worthy of the gods.

Chapter 1  
  
  
Just because I blacklisted his first love's hair salon, my boyfriend actually sent me‚Äîfive months pregnant‚Äîon a hiking trip to the remote Cascade wilderness.  
  
  
For a whole decade, Cassian Kemnis treated me with warmth and patience‚Äîalways the perfect boyfriend.  
  
  
Until he took me to his first love‚ÄîMelody Merouin's hair salon for a haircut.  
  
  
His precious ex deliberately destroyed the long hair I'd been growing for eighteen years.  
  
  
My modeling agency blacklisted her salon to protect me from further damage.  
  
  
Never expected my own devoted boyfriend would ditch me in the freaking Cascade wilderness.  
  
  
After I barely made it back‚Äîexhausted, scared out of my mind‚ÄîI heard him cracking up with his buddies.  
  
  
""Come on, it was just a little lesson. Does she seriously think she's hot shit or something? Girl's knocked up with no ring‚Äîwho the hell else is gonna want her dirty bitch besides me?""  
  
  
I didn‚Äôt cry, just scheduled an abortion appointment instead.  
  
  
Cassian Kemnis, we're done!  
  
  
...  
  
  
""Look at her‚Äîshe's all bloated now, and her own family's cutting ties with her. And she still had the nerve to mess with Melody? Big fucking deal‚Äîjust lost a bit of hair and pay some damn penalty fees. You don't screw with Melody. This is what happens.""  
  
  
I stood frozen in the doorway, listening to Cassian's words, my whole body shaking.  
  
  
Seven days. It took me seven whole goddamn days to get out of those mountains, filthy and soaked to the bone.  
  
  
Up until this exact moment, I'd been holding onto desperate hope‚Äîpraying my own boyfriend wasn't the one who dumped me in that hellish place.  
  
  
""Dude, aren‚Äôt you afraid she‚Äôll call off the wedding if she finds out?"" his buddy asked.  
  
  
Cassian snorted.  
  
  
""Doesn't matter if she knows or not. I'm all she's got. Nobody else would want her used-up bitch now. Besides, she's crazy in love with me. Pathetic.""  
  
  
His words cut through me like knives, ripping my heart to shreds.  
  
  
He was so confident I'd never leave him.  
  
  
I forced a bitter smile and stumbled to the corner store to borrow their phone.  
  
  
""Hello, Dad? It's me, Aurora.""  
  
  
An irritated voice came through the speaker.  
  
  
""You still have the nerve to call? I threw all your fucking stuff in the dumpster outside. Go dig through it yourself and don‚Äôt ever contact me. You're a fucking disgrace whore.""  
  
  
Before I could say another word, he hung up.  
  
  
Cassian was right. Nobody wanted me anymore.  
  
  
Even my own father had given up on me.  
  
  
Ten years ago, Cassian saved me on that snowy mountain when I was ready to end it all. Gave me a second chance at life.  
  
  
He said I had the most beautiful eyes.  
  
  
Later I realized it was because they looked exactly like Melody's.  
  
  
He'd been looking right through me at his percious ex this whole time.  
  
  
I walked out into the rain and stumbled barefoot into the hospital.  
  
  
""Hi, I need to schedule an abortion. As soon as possible.""  
  
  
After a full examination, the doctor shook his head.  
  
  
""Ma'am, you're severely malnourished and weak. Your uterine wall is dangerously thin, and at twenty weeks... if we do this procedure, you'll might never have children again.""  
  
  
My face went pale, my hands trembling.  
  
  
""Please do it.""  
  
  
I couldn't even take care of myself right now‚Äîhow could I be so selfish as to bring a child into this nightmare?  
  
  
The surgery was scheduled for next week.  
  
  
I dragged myself home, looking like hell.  
  
  
""Jesus Christ, Aurora, you look like hell. Can't you just stay put when you're pregnant? Always gotta cause drama.""  
  
  
Cassian's voice was mocking. His friends were cracking up behind him.  
  
  
Ten years of Oscar-worthy performances. Ten years of my love down the drain.  
  
  
I ignored them, just headed upstairs to the bedroom.  
  
  
Funny how that oversized wedding portrait of us looking so in love is still hanging above the bed, like nothing ever happened.""  
  
  
Right. I'd almost forgotten‚Äîour wedding was only in a month away.  
  
  
Just another chance for him to humiliate me, wasn't it?  
  
  
Timing it perfectly for when I'd really start showing.  
  
  
Let everyone see the knocked-up bride.  
  
  
I checked my phone. My agent had managed to push back the three million I owed in penalties.  
  
  
Now I felt nothing but bitterness.  
  
  
This was it. Game over.  
  
  
That night, Cassian spooned me from behind, his hand on my belly.  
  
  
""You and our little one are okay... right?""  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
""Yeah.""  
  
  
I closed my eyes, my voice flat as hell.  
  
  
Cassian's hand jerked away like I'd slapped him. My coldness clearly caught him off guard.  
  
  
""Cassian... do you actually love me?""  
  
  
He didn't even hesitate.  
  
  
""Of course I do.""  
  
  
Right on cue, his phone started buzzing.  
  
  
I could hear her crying through the speaker.  
  
  
""Cassian, I had that nightmare again where you abandon me. I'm so scared. Please don't marry her, don't leave me, please...""  
  
  
His voice turned all soft and urgent.  
  
  
""Hey, hey, Melody, it's okay. That's never gonna happen. I'm coming over right now.""  
  
  
After he hung up, he glanced back at me.  
  
  
""Aurora, quit the drama. I told you I'd marry you, and I meant it. Just take care of yourself and the baby.""  
  
  
Maybe dumping me in the mountains was finally eating at him, because suddenly he was pretending to give a shit about me.  
  
  
Then he was out the door, running to her like always.  
  
  
To him, I'd never be anything more than Melody's cheap stand-in.  
  
  
I got up and looked at all our old photos around the room.  
  
  
Funny thing‚Äîever since Melody came back, we hadn't taken a single picture together.  
  
  
At 3 AM, Melody posted on Instagram.  
  
  
Photos of Cassian driving all over the city at midnight hunting for her favorite macarons.  
  
  
A video of him making her pasta from scratch in her kitchen.  
  
  
Shit he'd never done for me. Not once in ten years.  
  
  
Cassian always told me to ""be more understanding.""  
  
  
And I never asked for anything.  
  
  
Turns out he didn't want someone understanding‚Äîhe just didn't want me.  
  
  
I grabbed every photo of us and ripped them to shreds, cutting up my hands in the process.  
  
  
Just like all the little wounds Cassian thought didn't count.  
  
  
Next morning, I ripped down every wedding decoration in the house.  
  
  
Keys jingled in the lock.  
  
  
Melody walked in like she owned the place.  
  
  
""God, Aurora, look at you. What makes you think you can compete with me?""  
  
  
Straight to the point. I had to give her that.  
  
  
But I'm not surprised at her here at all. ""What do you want, Melody?""  
  
  
My voice was ice.  
  
  
""Aw honey, if it bothers you, I won't move in. I just thought you could use some help. Cassian's worried sick about you.""  
  
  
Suddenly she was all sweet and concerned.  
  
  
Which meant Cassian was about to show up.  
  
  
Her sharp nails dug right into my belly.  
  
  
I pushed her hands away, protecting my baby on instinct.  
  
  
Melody let out this dramatic scream and threw herself backward, slamming her head into the corner of the coffee table.  
  
  
Blood started trickling down her face.  
  
  
""Melody!""  
  
  
Cassian dropped his suitcases and rushed to her side.  
  
  
""I'm fine, Cassian. Aurora's just... pregnancy hormones, you know? Don't be mad at her‚ÄîI shouldn't have surprised her like that.""  
  
  
Her eyes filled with tears, blood and mascara running down her cheeks.  
  
  
""What the fuck, Aurora? You keep attacking Melody for no goddamn reason. What is your problem?""  
  
  
Cassian pointed at me like I was some kind of monster.  
  
  
""Cassian, don't blame Aurora, okay? I'm sure she didn't mean it. Let‚Äôs just be thankful she‚Äôs safe.""  
  
  
Melody tugged on his sleeve, playing the perfect victim.  
  
  
""Please, stop with the constant doubts. If I really did hook up with Melody, do you honestly think you could compete with her? Look at yourself‚ÄîJesus, fat as hell.""  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
I didn't say a word to defend myself against Cassian's accusations.  
  
  
In the past, I would've been crying and begging for forgiveness by now.  
  
  
Not anymore. Not ever again.  
  
  
After a long silence, Cassian looked confused by my coldness.  
  
  
He couldn't figure out why I wasn't breaking down like usual.  
  
  
""You done? I'm tired.""  
  
  
I turned and walked back to the bedroom. No explanations, no drama, no fear of anyone leaving.  
  
  
That night, Cassian slipped into bed and pulled me close.  
  
  
""Aurora, I'm exhausted, okay? Just... be good and stop picking fights with Melody. Our wedding's in a month, and I'll give you everything I promised, alright?""  
  
  
He buried his face in my hair, his hand gently rubbing my belly.  
  
  
""Mm-hmm.""  
  
  
My voice was dead flat.  
  
  
I don't want the wedding. I don't want the baby. I don't want anything that has to do with you anymore.  
  
  
Keep your fucking promises yourself.  
  
  
The next day, Cassian dragged me and Melody to hang out with his friends.  
  
  
He said I'd be ""more comfortable"" in the back seat.  
  
  
I closed my eyes and listened to him and Melody laugh and flirt in the front.  
  
  
All their inside jokes, their shared history. None of it included me.  
  
  
At the bar, it was the usual crowd‚ÄîCassian's asshole buddies.  
  
  
All of them were Team Melody.  
  
  
""Damn, the wife and the mistress, side by side like besties! Man, talk about living the dream!"" His buddy teased.  
  
  
""Oh my god, don't say that! Aurora's carrying his baby‚ÄîI could never compete with that! Cassian and I are just friends!""  
  
  
Melody covered her face, all fake-bashful.  
  
  
""Cut it out, guys.""  
  
  
Cassian barely tried to shut them down.  
  
  
""Aurora, sit here.""  
  
  
He pulled out my chair, then immediately did the same for Melody.  
  
  
When the server started pouring drinks, Cassian grabbed his wrist before he could fill Melody's glass.  
  
  
""Skip her‚Äîshe gets all red and gross when she drinks.""  
  
  
I stared at my own glass, already filled to the top, and almost laughed.  
  
  
Didn't give a damn to his pregrent fianc√©e, but another woman. Guess Cassian did love her.  
  
  
Someone suggested playing spin the bottle with truth or dare.  
  
  
First spin landed on Melody.  
  
  
They dared her to play the pocky game with someone.  
  
  
She covered her face like she was so embarrassed, then pointed at Cassian all shy.  
  
  
""Cassian, would you... help me out?""  
  
  
He glanced at me, saw my blank expression and shrugged.  
  
  
""Yeah, whatever.""  
  
  
Everyone lost their minds cheering as their faces got closer and closer.  
  
  
The whole table went crazy while I just sat there quietly rub my belly.  
  
  
Like everyone forgot I was supposed to be Kevin's fianc√©e.  
  
  
After they finished the cookie, Cassian's ears were bright red.  
  
  
""Bro, it's honestly tragic you two never hooked up. I always thought you'd end up together‚Äîyou're like, soulmates or whatever. Plus all that crazy shit you used to do for Melody in college? Good times.""  
  
  
Cassian shot him a warning look and the guy finally shut up.  
  
  
Then he grabbed my hand.  
  
  
""Aurora, they're just messing around. Don't take it seriously.""  
  
  
I smiled at him like I couldn't care less.  
  
  
""It's fine. Doesn't bother me.""  
  
  
Cassian looked satisfied with my reaction.  
  
  
Then the bottle spun again.  
  
  
This time it pointed at me.  
  
  
I looked around the table. They all had this excited, predatory look.  
  
  
""Ooh, how about pregnant mama does her best kangaroo impression? She's already got the pouch going, and that hair's looking pretty wild‚Äîjust hop around a bit!""  
  
  
I looked straight at Cassian.  
  
  
He didn't stop them or think there was anything wrong with his friends humiliating his pregnant fianc√©e.  
  
  
He was totally used to it.  
  
  
Because this wasn't the first time anyway.  
  
  
I used to think taking their dirty shit was my ticket into his world.  
  
  
It took me way too long to realize some circles aren't worth joining‚Äîespecially when they make it crystal clear you're not wanted.

On Saturday he doesn‚Äôt reach out until 5 pm to let me know that his sister is in town and that we cant have our date Saturday. He doesn‚Äôt even apologize or sound like he feels bad. He doesn‚Äôt even attempt to reschedule it or promise to let me know when we will meet up again. After he lets me know about the cancellation, I don‚Äôt even hear from him until Sunday at noon where he gives me a cold ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù text, just like that, no emojis, and no asking about me. 
He has done things like this before. He had recently been on a 2 week work trip and when he came back we only met up for 1.5 hours and he informed me during that meetup that he has a bbq to attend (he didn‚Äôt even invite me). We barely ever meet up and when we do, it‚Äôs only 1-2 hours MAX.

ALSO, the big kicker (I need to hear your opinions on this), he said his instagram had been hacked like 10 months ago. I found his instagram which is private and I noticed that the followers and following count keeps increasing. It‚Äôs showing that someone is actively using it because they have to accept those requests.


So, on that Sunday where he sent me the coldest good morning text, I sent a long text message to him basically asking him if he is married/has a gf or if he even likes me and listed out the reasons. This is the third time that I had to ‚Äúcomplain‚Äù to him about his hot and cold behavior and his lack of communication. He called me ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù for ‚Äúcounting his instagram followers‚Äù and told me I‚Äôm a huge complainer and that actually he was going to call me if I had only replied to the good morning text and he was going to have a fun chat with me and ask to see me for dinner/coffee that night. I believed him initially about the dinner and coffee but idk now.

Anyways, was I in the wrong to send him a text like that? Was I in the wrong to ask him if he was seeing someone else? We had agreed to be exclusive. Should I have just accepted the back to back cancellations and not said anything about it?",1,1754342622.0,AmIOverreacting,17,0.67,False
1mhq81v,https://www.reddit.com/r/SECFilingsAI/comments/1mhq81v/brc_inc_quarterly_report_released_heres_what_you/,BRC Inc. Quarterly Report Released - Here‚Äôs What You Should Know,"BRC Inc. ‚Äì Q2 2025 Summary for Investors

Key Financial Metrics (as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2025):
- Revenue: $184.8 million (down 1% from $187.4 million YoY)
  - Wholesale: $118.1 million (up 3%)
  - Direct-to-Consumer (DTC): $55.4 million (down 12%)
  - Outpost (Company-operated stores): $11.3 million (up 7%)
- Gross Profit: $64.6 million (down 19% from $79.4 million)
- Gross Margin: 35% (42% prior year)
- Operating Loss: $(18.1) million (compared to $4.9 million operating income prior year)
- Net Loss: $(22.4) million (was $0.5 million net income prior year)
- Net Loss Attributable to BRC Inc.: $(8.2) million (compared to $0.07 million income)
- Net Loss per Share: $(0.10) basic and diluted
- Cash and Cash Equivalents: $4.3 million (down from $6.8 million at year-end 2024)
- Long-Term Debt, Net: $70.1 million (up from $63.0 million)
- Total Liabilities: $189.6 million (up from $177.9 million)
- Stockholders‚Äô Equity: $35.7 million (down from $49.5 million)

Cash Flow:
- Operating Activities: $(7.5) million net outflow (compared to $7.2 million inflow prior year)
- Investing Activities: $(2.1) million outflow
- Financing Activities: $7.1 million inflow

Recent Developments:
- Operational Improvement Plan began in Q2 2025, including a workforce reduction of ~48 employees and $2.1 million in associated restructuring costs (with $1.6 million still accrued at period-end).
- On July 18, 2025, completed an underwritten offering of 28,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock for additional liquidity.

Key Risks (with Specific Examples):
- Gross Margin Compression: Gross margin fell to 35% from 42% YoY due to higher cost of goods sold and increased operational costs. Cost of goods sold rose by $12.2 million, while gross profit dropped $14.8 million.
- DTC Revenue Decline: DTC channel revenue was down 12% YoY, reflecting challenges in customer acquisition and retention despite company efforts to optimize digital marketing spend.
- Profitability Pressures: Operating expenses increased 11% ($8.2 million), notably in marketing & advertising (up 40% or $6.1 million) and ‚Äúother operating expenses, net‚Äù (up 1,801%, or $5.8 million, which included restructuring).
- Execution on Improvement Plan: The recently launched Operational Improvement Plan is intended to deliver cost reductions, but management acknowledges that it may not yield intended efficiencies and could negatively impact operations.
- Debt Load and Lease Obligations: Long-term debt increased to $70.1 million, and large non-cancelable lease and purchase commitments remain ($104.7 million future purchase obligations through 2029).
- Ongoing Legal Matters: Several unresolved lawsuits could pose financial and reputational risk. Noteworthy examples: complaints with Tang Capital Partners and co-manufacturer lawsuits.
- Supply Chain Risks: Continued volatility in costs and reliability for coffee, ingredients, packaging, and logistics; $12.2 million YoY increase in cost of goods sold due in part to these factors.
- Macroeconomic & Regulatory Risks: Risks from changes in U.S. trade policy, tariffs, and regulatory environment could increase costs and disrupt operations.
- Cash Position & Liquidity: Cash and equivalents declined to $4.3 million at quarter-end. Recent equity offering supports liquidity, but ongoing negative cash flow from operations is a concern.

Management Discussion & Strategic Outlook:
- Wholesale channel expansion continues to drive growth (revenue up 3%), but DTC decline moderating is a key focus area. ""Strategic initiatives to optimize customer acquisition and retention"" are in progress but yet to deliver growth.
- The Outpost retail channel is stabilizing, with management focusing on transaction growth and improving average order value.
- Management expects that efforts to manage costs via the Operational Improvement Plan and restructuring should improve long-term profitability, but short-term disruptions and further restructuring charges are anticipated.
- Supply chain management and product line expansion are priorities, though cost and sourcing pressures remain material.
- Liquidity has been bolstered by the July equity issuance, but continued cash burn will require further attention.

Conclusion:
BRC Inc. faces significant gross margin and profitability headwinds despite modest top-line growth in non-DTC channels. Management is actively pursuing cost-cutting and operational improvements amid rising legal, macroeconomic, and supply chain risks. The recent equity raise provides short-term liquidity relief, but returning to cash flow positive operations and resuming profitability are critical for long-term investor value. Investors should closely monitor execution of the improvement plan, DTC channel performance, legal exposures, and the company‚Äôs ability to manage its commitments and obligations.

\-------  
  
  
The year I finished high school, on Mom's birthday, Dad brought home a mother-daughter pair and a red rose.  
  
  
Mom took the red rose the little girl handed her and quietly spent her 39th birthday. That night, she slit her wrists.  
  
  
So on my wedding day, I told my husband Blake Ashford, ""If you want a divorce, just give me red roses.""  
  
  
He held me close and said, ""Don't worry, babe. There won't be any flowers in our house. Ever.""  
  
  
Five years later, during a company bidding process, he kicked out the partners and blacklisted them completely‚Äîjust because someone on their team wore a red rose on her chest.  
  
  
That day, I realized marriage could actually be beautiful.  
  
  
Until six months later, I finished my new drug research and walked out of the lab.  
  
  
The entire hallway was covered in roses.  
  
  
And there was Blake, standing in the middle of it.  
  
  
Right next to him? The same woman he'd kicked out of his company, smiling like the cat who got the cream.  
  
  
My face turned ice-cold, but the man just shrugged like it was no big deal.  
  
  
""Lila put all this together for you. She's your sister. She came here to patch things up between you two.""  
  
  
I stared at Blake for two seconds flat, then turned and walked out.  
  
  
I don't have a sister.  
  
  
And as of right now, I don't need a husband either.  
  
  
...  
  
  
I sat alone at Mom's grave for three hours. Today was her birthday and the tenth anniversary of her death.  
  
  
Red roses used to mean love for my parents.  
  
  
But ten years ago today, Dad just stood there while his mistress's daughter Lila Morrison handed Mom that rose, breaking her completely.  
  
  
Red roses became my worst nightmare.  
  
  
And ten years later, my husband brought the woman who destroyed my mother right back to me, with all those damn flowers. Talk about a knife to the heart.  
  
  
Fireworks lit up the sky in the distance‚ÄîBlake's party celebrating my drug research. Six months of hell, 180 days of no sleep, all my work. Now it felt like Lila's victory dance.  
  
  
I said goodbye to Mom and stood up when Blake called.  
  
  
He was drunk: ""Party's almost over and you're MIA? What kind of research director are you?""  
  
  
I stayed quiet.  
  
  
Any other night, I would've been all playful and sweet with him. But tonight I had nothing to say.  
  
  
Blake's voice got louder: ""Ember, I'm talking to you! Where the hell did you disappear to?""  
  
  
""The cemetery.""  
  
  
Blake went silent. Like he suddenly remembered today was my mom's anniversary. Like he suddenly remembered that for my research, I'd skipped my own birthday, canceled our anniversary dinner. The one thing I asked for was for him to come with me to visit Mom.  
  
  
Two seconds of dead silence before Blake finally spoke: ""I... I was so excited about today, I forgot.""  
  
  
""Wait for me.""  
  
  
I hung up, then turned and left straight away.  
  
  
But when I reached the parking lot, Blake's texts came through:  
  
  
\[Ember, it's too late tonight. Next time, okay?\]  
  
  
\[Lila's wasted. I need to get her home first.\]  
  
  
\[Don't worry, I'll make it up to you.\]  
  
  
I wasn't surprised at all.  
  
  
With Lila's games, of course she'd find a way to keep Blake busy tonight. I could see right through her act. Blake, who'd survived years in cutthroat business, could definitely see it too.  
  
  
But Blake didn't care. He was enjoying every second of it. He didn't give a damn about my feelings.  
  
  
That's fine though. From now on, I don't have to care about his either.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
Blake didn't come home that night. No texts, no calls, nothing.  
  
  
I didn't care. Didn't even ask.  
  
  
Next morning, I got to the office early. Blake was the CEO, I ran R&D. In five years, we'd built this company from a garage startup to a downtown powerhouse.  
  
  
But our relationship? Went the opposite direction.  
  
  
Phase one of the new drug was done, so things were pretty quiet for now.  
  
  
I was sipping my coffee, reading through the divorce papers my lawyer sent, when Blake walked into my office.  
  
  
I was drinking my coffee and going through the divorce papers my lawyer sent when Blake strolled into my office.  
  
  
""Lila twisted her ankle getting out of the car last night, so I had to take care of her.  
  
  
It got really late, so I just grabbed a hotel room.""  
  
  
I nodded and kept reading my divorce papers, answering without looking up: ""Okay, got it.""  
  
  
Made sense. We were about to get divorced anyway.  
  
  
Who he slept with and where was his business, not mine. No need to keep me in the loop.  
  
  
Blake froze, like he wanted to say something but held back:  
  
  
""Let's grab dinner tonight. You're the star of this whole drug project‚Äîwe should celebrate properly.""  
  
  
He paused, glanced at me, then added: ""Maybe we should invite Lila too. I think you two need to talk. She was just a kid when your mom died, you know.""  
  
  
Hearing Blake defend Lila made my hand stop mid-page.  
  
  
I wanted to ask him‚Äîwasn't I just a kid too when my mom killed herself?  
  
  
I pushed down my anger, took a sip of coffee, and said quietly: ""Mind your own business. Tonight, just us two.""  
  
  
We needed to talk about the divorce anyway. Didn't need an audience.  
  
  
Sister? My mom only had one daughter. Me.  
  
  
Blake looked at me like I was being jealous.  
  
  
He was about to smirk and say something when his phone rang.  
  
  
The second he saw ""Lila"" pop up, his face lit up. He grabbed his phone and bolted out of my office.  
  
  
Near closing time, Blake sent me a restaurant reservation.  
  
  
Some fancy private place. His idea of making it up to me.  
  
  
I stuffed the divorce papers in my bag and headed out.  
  
  
Blake's car pulled up as I left the building. He rolled down the window: ""Go home and get ready. Quick client meeting, then I'll meet you there.""  
  
  
He drove off before I could even answer.  
  
  
I used to spend two hours getting ready for dates with Blake. Always stressed about makeup and outfits, but somehow loved every minute of it.  
  
  
Not tonight though. No point.  
  
  
Instead, I hit up a massage place nearby. Let my body unwind after all those late nights and overtime. Felt amazing.  
  
  
When I got to the restaurant, Blake wasn't there yet. I texted him‚Äîno response.  
  
  
I shrugged and didn't wait around like usual. Just ordered.  
  
  
The place was actually really nice. Great atmosphere, incredible food. Way better than wolfing down takeout at the office.  
  
  
So when Blake never showed up, I wasn't even mad.  
  
  
The guy threw away seven years with me. Why would I care about one more no-show?  
  
  
Truth is, he had no clue. The biggest gift he could give me was signing those divorce papers.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
After dinner, I walked home slowly. All those sleepless nights at work had cut me off from the world. The street life around me felt refreshing.  
  
  
I stopped when I reached a familiar corner.  
  
  
The garage where Blake and I started our company was gone‚Äîcompletely demolished.  
  
  
That little dumpling shop where we'd eat every day to save a buck? Now it was some fancy bakery.  
  
  
Everything changes. Even the memories I used to treasure had faded with time.  
  
  
My phone rang. It was my old professor.  
  
  
There was hesitation in his voice: ""Ember, your application for the classified 707 project got approved yesterday.""  
  
  
""But I need to ask one more time‚Äîare you absolutely sure about this?""  
  
  
""It's a five-year commitment minimum. Without you, your husband's company will tank.""  
  
  
""Will he be okay with this?""  
  
  
I stepped forward, leaving that familiar street behind, my voice steady: ""Professor, I'm getting divorced.""  
  
  
...  
  
  
Since the classified project was starting soon and I wanted out fast, I told him to send someone tomorrow.  
  
  
I wasn't in the mood to wander around anymore, so I just grabbed a cab home.  
  
  
The living room lights were on. Blake was on the couch, texting someone.  
  
  
The second he saw me, his frown disappeared.  
  
  
He rushed over, grabbed my hand, and demanded: ""Why didn't you wait for me at the restaurant? I showed up and you were gone‚Äîdo you know how embarrassing that was?!""  
  
  
I stared at him, surprised he'd actually gone.  
  
  
But seeing him act all righteous and offended? I almost laughed.  
  
  
Made sense though. He was used to me waiting around for him.  
  
  
I pulled my hand away from Blake's grip. ""I was done eating. Why would I stick around?""  
  
  
Maybe realizing he was actually in the wrong, he swallowed his irritation and handed me a gift box.  
  
  
""Got this specially for you today. Go ahead, open it.""  
  
  
Not surprising. After standing me up twice, he had to throw me a bone.  
  
  
That was Blake's thing‚Äîmess up, then toss me some small gesture afterward.  
  
  
And I used to sit there anxiously hoping for more, maybe just a little extra time together.  
  
  
I took the box and tossed it on the couch.  
  
  
""How thoughtful.""  
  
  
My tone was flat and polite.  
  
  
His smile froze. First time he'd actually noticed I was going through the motions.  
  
  
Panic flickered in his eyes as he reached for my hand again.  
  
  
That's when Lila's voice drifted down from upstairs:  
  
  
""Blake, maybe I should just go home. I don't want Ember getting the wrong idea when she comes back.""  
  
  
She appeared at the top of the stairs, and when she saw me, the smugness in her eyes vanished. She covered her mouth, putting on this whole shocked act.  
  
  
Blake rushed to explain: ""Lila hurt her ankle yesterday, so I took her for a follow-up today. That's why I was late.""  
  
  
""She can barely walk right now, so I told her to crash in the guest room tonight.""  
  
  
He stared at me intensely, like he was bracing for me to blow up.  
  
  
I nodded, completely unbothered: ""Fine. I'll grab a hotel room then. I'm not staying under the same roof as her.""  
  
  
Blake just stood there, stunned. This wasn't the reaction he was expecting.  
  
  
""If you really don't want Lila staying here, I can take her‚Äî""  
  
  
Before he could finish, Lila tumbled down the stairs and started sobbing, clutching her foot.  
  
  
Blake freaked out and rushed to carry her back upstairs, massaging her ankle.  
  
  
When I came back downstairs with my suitcase, Blake appeared in the living room again.  
  
  
His lips were pressed tight as he grabbed my hand, refusing to let go. The guilt in his eyes kept growing deeper.  
  
  
Finally, with Lila calling for him upstairs, he said: ""Tomorrow. I'll go with you to see your mom. We'll talk everything out in front of her.""  
  
  
I stared at him blankly and walked out.  
  
  
Talk? He could talk to my lawyer.  
  
  
The second Lila showed up in our house, I was done discussing anything with him‚Äîeven the divorce.

a whole month, nearing on two, of writing the first few acts through his lense, i hadn‚Äôt slept for days in a row, only with the seldom 30 minute winks of rest my body would let me. i‚Äôd forget to eat and hydrate, and so on.

essentially, i started living in the same state as him and it helped me efficiently write him and everything through his view.
now, when i‚Äôm trying to correct these faults i, predictably, cannot write even a singular sentence as him. pages blank, head empty. the words won‚Äôt roll to my fingers like they always do.

I love taking the top down and riding scenic roads with my gf. Beachside, highway, etc. 

Until now I‚Äôve been taking a plastic cooler in the trunk with Gatorade, water, lemonade, cold coffee and ice tea. Mostly cold stuff. It‚Äôs summer and me and my gf stop to drink cold drinks at cool spots. But it‚Äôs annoying to change the ice, and sometimes we cannot find spots to buy more ice when we most need it.  So she jokingly said. At this point just install a mini fridge in the trunk. 

And I was like: fuck is that a thing? 
Like I do know some cars have the power to do that. I‚Äôm guessing the Mustang could probably do it? 
So I am mainly asking you more experienced guys and Mustang modders, how stupid is this idea, 
Are we cooking? Or is it dumb. ?
I suppose that would be very intensive on the battery, maybe increase my gas consumption, idk. If at all possible to do it I guess it would come with its downsides right? 

What are your thoughts and opinions on this? Should I investigate more or should I drop this idea ?

1mhq72b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mhq72b/i_just_found_out_that_my_relationship_with_my/,I just found out that my relationship with my wife is based on a complete lie,"This is a long one and there are a lot of details that probably feel unnecessary, hopefully it will make sense why I included them by the end.

I (30 M) have been with my now wife (30 F, I‚Äôll call her C) for 10 years, married for a little over 2 months. We met in class freshman year of college. I was in a long distance relationship with my childhood best friend and longtime family friend and made that known to C. I could tell C had a big crush on me (and her friends always hinted this was the case), and I did everything I could to distance myself from her. However, we ended up in the same friend group and she always got someone to invite her to my frats parties. I was very open with my GF about how actively C was pursuing me, and my GF knew that I was doing everything in my power to stay away from her, including skipping hanging out with my friend group when I knew she would be in attendance. At the end of the semester I finally told C off, and said that what she was doing wasn‚Äôt cool and that she needed to stay away from me. She denied even having a crush on me and got pretty emotional.

After that she left me alone, she would occasionally show up to a frat party and would say hello but nothing more. Skip to the end of freshman year, and C asks if I will meet her for coffee. I talked to my GF and she agreed I should go talk to her and see what she has to say. I met C for coffee and she admitted that she had a huge crush on me and apologized for how she acted around me during first semester. I thanked her for the apology, told her that she should move on, and that I‚Äôd see her on campus next school year. I debriefed with my GF and went home for the summer.¬†

My sophomore year started normally and I hadn‚Äôt seen C at all. About two weeks into the semester I was a sober monitor at a frat party and got word that a guest was passed out and needed help. I went and found her on a couch in one of the party rooms. She was awake but could hardly walk and was incoherent. I made a pledge get a car ready for her and let some of the brothers know I was going to carry her to the car and take her to the hospital. I got her into the pledge ride but about two minutes into the ride she suddenly sobered up and asked if I would take her to her dorm instead. I agreed and walked her to the door to make sure she got in safe before heading back to the party. Her dorm floor was having a party so there were oohs and ahhs but I just ignored it and got back to the party.

A week later and my GF was being kind of distant. She wouldn‚Äôt tell me what was up and finally she asked me if I would facetime her. I did, expecting that she was feeling down and just wanted to chat. Instead I got blindsided. She accused me of cheating, and when I denied it she showed me photos she had been sent from two different IG accounts from girls who said they attended my school. One had sent pics of me at the party picking up the drunk girl and getting into the car with her that looked suspect, the other sent a photo of me opening her dorm room door for her. The IG account that sent photos from the party said I was getting the girl drunk all night and was all over her. The IG account from the dorm said I went into the drunk girls dorm room. I tried to explain what happened and she wasn‚Äôt hearing it. I was in disbelief, we both cried, I knew how it looked and knew that she was going to break up with me. She dumped me and ended the call.

I didn‚Äôt just take it lying down and tried to find out who these IG accounts were & why they would lie. My now ex wouldn't tell me who they were, but I found both of them by looking at who had recently followed her. The accounts were sketchy, pretty new, minimal pictures. I checked the names with people who had signed into the party (you had to bring a valid ID so we could make sure no HS townies were trying to get into the party, and so if we had to ban people we could make sure they didn‚Äôt try to come back) and neither of the names were on the list. After about a week of research I went back to my Ex and told her everything I found, and how I thought these were fake accounts. I asked if she would tell me how they knew my name or how to find her but she refused to say anything, said I should just admit it, and then hung up.

After that I accepted that it was over. The rest of the semester was a blur. I focused on my class, spent most of my free time in the library, and tried to move on. My fraternity brothers tried to set me up with a bunch of people for a rebound but I made it clear I wasn‚Äôt interested. After finals, my parents encouraged me to stay on campus another day or two. I didn‚Äôt really want to but they were paying for my flight home so I relented. I enjoyed the company of my fraternity brothers and had a good time for the first time since I got dumped.

When I got home for break I found out why my family wanted me to stay an extra day. My parents and my ex‚Äôs parents were best friends and all had a holiday party together. My ex never told my parents directly what happened, but she told her sister and her sister told her parents who told mine and my siblings. I believe my ex didn‚Äôt want that to happen, but I don't think I‚Äôll ever know. My parents sat me down and told me to fess up, and I tried to tell them my side but they wouldn‚Äôt hear it. They let me know that I wouldn‚Äôt be invited to any future get-togethers with my ex‚Äôs family. The only person who believed me was my younger sister, my two older siblings who were also childhood friends with my ex and her family never looked at me the same.

That winter was probably the lowest point in my life, and I don‚Äôt know what would have happened if I didn‚Äôt have my sister and fraternity brothers to support me. I ended up paying my own way to fly back to school the day after Christmas which made my parents even more upset, but I couldn‚Äôt handle being around them anymore. A few of my fraternity brothers who were townies invited me to spend new years and the rest of the holiday with them. I agreed, and it was a great distraction. I didn‚Äôt blame my family for believing what they were told, but I blamed them for not giving me the chance to tell my side of the story.

Flash forward to week one of sophomore year. I‚Äôm sitting in my classroom on syllabus day and I see C walk in. She sees me, gives a wave and sits on the other side of the room, in about the furthest seat you could pick from me. I spent three weeks in class with her when one day I noticed on my walk out that we were heading in the same direction. I caught up to her and we started to chat. She was very reserved and I could tell she didn‚Äôt really want to talk so I made an excuse to walk the other way and I did. Another few weeks later she showed up to one of my frat‚Äôs parties with a group of friends. She avoided me almost the entire night, but at the end of the night she saw me standing by the bar and came up to me. She was very drunk, and she told me that she was sorry for being weird when we talked last, but she wanted to be respectful of my relationship with my GF. I told her it was all good and that me and my GF had broken up in September. She just kind of stared at me before one of her friends grabbed her and said they were heading to a bar. She got pulled away from me before she could say anything else and I just went on with my night.

Over the course of the school year we chatted more, started sitting next to each other in class, and grabbed lunch a few times. She never brought up my ex, never pried into my dating life, and didn‚Äôt seem like she was interested in me anymore. I wasn‚Äôt ready to start another relationship yet, and I was thankful to have someone to talk to that wasn‚Äôt a fraternity brother.

Towards the end of the school year my fraternity was having its formal. It was a long weekend in Gatlinburg. I wasn‚Äôt planning on going until one of my frat brothers told me that he was taking one of C‚Äôs best friends. He wanted to know if I would bring C so his date could have another person they knew with them for the long weekend. After a good bit of pestering from him I agreed. I asked C the next time I saw her and she seemed surprised that I asked, but she accepted.

I went to an undergrad with a huge Greek life population so we took formals seriously. We rented what was essentially a cabin style mansion in Gatlinburg that was mostly bunk rooms, but it had a few individual rooms. When we got there, before the festivities started we drew straws to see who got private rooms. C drew for us and the straw she drew was marked on the bottom so we got a private room. I tried to quietly tell my fraternity brothers that we didn‚Äôt need one but they brushed me off. The first night was mostly uneventful, drinking games, dancing, and watching movies in the theater. I volunteered to be sober the first night so I didn‚Äôt have to cover for anyone the next two nights. C spent most of the time with her friend and a few of the other girls. That night we slept in the same bed, but it was a king and we each stayed squarely on our side.

The second day was spent hiking and touring some distilleries. When the second night came it was time for couples drinking games. C is, and was back then, very small, but she could hold her own drinking and was extremely competitive. I‚Äôm a pretty big guy who is tipsy after one beer. Before we started I told C if she wasn‚Äôt comfortable with some of the games to let me know because a lot of them were very contact heavy. C‚Äôs response was something along the lines of ‚Äúyou‚Äôd better not chicken out on me, we‚Äôre winning this.‚Äù

After about 4 hours of drinking games, we didn‚Äôt even come close to winning. That part of the night is still a little hazy, but when it came time to go to bed I had sobered a little. Once we were both in bed I turned out the light, but before I could fall asleep she said ‚ÄúThank you for inviting me even after how I acted freshman year.‚Äù¬† I told her it was water under the bridge, but I could tell something was still bothering her. She finally admitted that she still had feelings for me, and wanted to know if there was any chance that something could happen between us. I felt bad for how long I thought it over in my head, but I decided that I had been moping about my Ex for too long and I needed to move on. C was beautiful, we had the same interests, I was having a blast with her this weekend, and she was respectful/there for me when we reconnected over the past school year. I told her it could be something more, and we both sort of stared at each other in the darkness. We kissed that night, but we both didn‚Äôt want to go further after drinking so much.

The next day was the best I‚Äôd had since before my breakup with my ex. I spent the morning making breakfast for some of my best friends, went on a peaceful hike with C where we talked a little bit more about the night before, and then took the party bus into town with just the guys for a pregame while our dates got ready.

The night was even better than the day. We rented out a restaurant for dinner and a bar for after. C and I danced all night, did some light drinking, and shared a few kisses on the dancefloor. I got a lot of oohs and ahhs from my fraternity brothers, and overheard a few people saying things like ‚Äúfinally‚Äù and ‚Äúwe got him back.‚Äù By the end of the night, C and I were inseparable. We hooked up that night, started dating shortly after, and are married now 10 years later. Up till a few days ago it‚Äôs been a perfect relationship and I‚Äôve been truly happy with her.

We got married in May, and two weeks before we had a joint bachelor/bachelorette party where the groups ate dinner together, split up for an activity, and ended up at a bar to close the night. When the groomsman parted with the bridesmaids, everyone was in good spirits. When we got to the bar, the bridesmaids were already there and it was obvious something had happened. Two of C‚Äôs bridesmaids were her best friends from college, and one of them had way too much to drink and was loudly arguing with C and her other college friend. Before we made it all the way to them I heard the drunk one say something along the lines of ‚Äúhe deserves to know‚Äù and then stormed out of the bar. When I went up to C to ask what was up, she told me a story about how she had lied to her coworker about why he missed out on a promotion. It was odd, but I was drunk and in a great mood so I brushed it off and enjoyed the night.

Then, the day before our wedding C told me that I needed to bump a groomsman because her friend that had stormed out of the bar was sick with the flu and wouldn‚Äôt make the rehearsal dinner or the wedding. I was bummed, but the groomsman I bumped was fine with it, and he still got to be in all the wedding party photos.

Over the years leading up to the wedding I spent less and less time with my family. Part of it was them, and part of it was me. I stopped coming home for holidays (I live out of state now), but they never reached out or returned calls. They didn‚Äôt even reach out to see if I passed the Bar Exam. They still resented me because they thought I cheated on my ex, lied to them, and damaged their friendship with her family. I asked both my parents to do toasts at the wedding and they said no, thankfully my sister was willing to give a speech at the rehearsal dinner. My mom also requested that we skip the mother son dance. That was a gut punch, but I respected her wishes. My family watched the ceremony, ate dinner, and then left. I didn‚Äôt let it bother me and I had an amazing night with my wife.

Now we get to present day. I‚Äôm out of town for a 6-week trial while C stays home and watches our cats. I‚Äôve been gone for three weeks and she surprised me with a visit over the second weekend. We have our honeymoon scheduled for the end of trial, so she‚Äôs also finishing up last minute packing.

A few nights ago after I got back to the hotel from the courthouse I got a call from her college friend that couldn‚Äôt make it to the wedding because she had the flu. I hadn‚Äôt seen her since then, but I figured C hung out with her without me. She hadn‚Äôt ever called me so I was immediately worried that something had happened to C. I answered and before she could say anything I asked if C was okay and she reassured me that she was fine. She made sure that C wasn‚Äôt with me, and said that she‚Äôs been seeing a therapist because she‚Äôs been feeling guilty. I wished her well and asked what it had to do with me. She broke into tears immediately and then just started to let everything out.¬†

C had orchestrated everything. The drunk girl I helped get back to her room at that party was C‚Äôs friend's cousin that was in town for a college visit. The two accounts that sent my ex photos of me were C‚Äôs two best friends. She had deleted the account by then, but she still had the email from IG setting up the account and showed it to me. C had found out through one of my fraternity brothers what classes I was taking and switched into it at the start of sophomore year. She knew well before I told her that my ex and I had broken up. She got one of her friends to start sleeping with my fraternity brother so that he would tell me to invite C to the formal. She even got my fraternity brother that was handing out straws to give her one that would give us a private room. She showed me old texts from C, talking about how she pretended to be uninterested in me and played hard to get the fall of sophomore year, and her bragging about us hooking up and finally ‚Äúwinning.‚Äù C‚Äôs friend didn‚Äôt miss the wedding because she was sick with the flu, but because she felt like she may have ruined my life.

I really didn‚Äôt know what to say. C‚Äôs friend cried almost the whole time, but said that C is wholly devoted to me, and hasn‚Äôt manipulated me since that formal. I‚Äôm not sure I believe her, but once we hung up I texted C that I wasn‚Äôt feeling well and was going to bed so I couldn‚Äôt Facetime her that night and talk about the trial. Her and I have talked a few times since, and I‚Äôve been able to keep my cool but she can tell something is up. She‚Äôs planning to fly in for a night or two next weekend and I‚Äôm going to confront her then.

I really don‚Äôt know how to handle this. Obviously I need to talk to her about it and I am going to. I know there are going to be calls for immediate divorce, but I‚Äôve dedicated 10 years of my life to C, and I love her, so I feel I owe it to hear her side before I make any rash decisions. Even if everything is true, I‚Äôm not sure I would end things, I‚Äôm 30 and in a very busy field, and I feel like if I end things I‚Äôll end up alone. I do have some friends that practice family law, so If it does go that way I am prepared.¬†

I‚Äôm mainly seeking guidance as to my family. They‚Äôre practically no contact with me because of something I can now prove I didn‚Äôt do. But it‚Äôs been 10 years of unkindness, and I‚Äôm not sure that even if they apologize and accept me back into their lives that I‚Äôll want to be a part of it. Plus, If I tell them and they want me back in their lives, they won‚Äôt want C in their lives if I choose to stay with her.¬†

I am definitely not telling my ex or her family. She is in a long term relationship with a guy who my younger sister says is perfect for her. I don‚Äôt want her to have guilt for something that wasn‚Äôt her fault, and I don‚Äôt want her to think about what her life would be like if she had believed me.

So that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at. I‚Äôll take any advice y‚Äôall can give me.

TLDR: I found out my wife orchestrated a plan to get my long-distance GF to break up with me in college so that I would date her instead.

*Where the Underdog‚Äôs Hope is Thinner Than Luzardo‚Äôs Pitching Repertoire*

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‚Äòround for a tale of two teams: the Philadelphia Phillies, strutting into Citizens Bank Park like they own the place (which, honestly, they kind of do), and the Baltimore Orioles, who‚Äôve spent the season asking, ‚ÄúIs this thing on?‚Äù Let‚Äôs dissect this matchup with the precision of a scout timing a fastball‚Äîand the humor of a comedian who‚Äôs had one too many coffee breaks.

---

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie (But They Might Laugh at You)

The Phillies (-198 moneyline) are the clear favorites here, with an implied probability of **66.6%** to win. That‚Äôs not just a number‚Äîit‚Äôs a *statement*. They‚Äôve won 54 of 88 games as favorites this season, including a 18-4 clip when backed by shorter odds like these. Meanwhile, the Orioles (+200) are a mere 25-56 as underdogs, which is about as effective as a screen door on a submarine.

The total is set at **9.5 runs**, with the Under (-115) slightly more enticing than the Over (-110). Why? Because Jesus Luzardo, the Phillies‚Äô lefty starter, is aiming for his 10th win of the season. He‚Äôs got the ERA of a man who‚Äôs mastered the art of ‚Äúalmost there‚Äù (3.82), but against a Baltimore lineup that‚Äôs hitting just .231 as a team? Consider it a mismatch. Cade Povich, the Orioles‚Äô starter, is a rookie with the stuff of a guy who‚Äôd rather be pitching in a video game‚Äîhis 4.92 ERA screams ‚ÄúI need a level-up.‚Äù

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Lineups, and Metaphors

The Phillies‚Äô offense is a Hollywood blockbuster: Trea Turner (5.1 WAR, because he‚Äôs basically a one-man wrecking crew), Bryce Harper (a .310 average that makes him the team‚Äôs emotional leader and cleanup hitter), and Kyle Schwarber (a man who can hit a home run so far, it‚Äôs in another ZIP code). Their rotation? A mix of ‚Äúelite‚Äù (Luzardo) and ‚Äúmeh, but it works‚Äù (the rest of them).

The Orioles? They‚Äôre the sports equivalent of a group project that forgot to meet. Gunna

Nothing happened that caused the friendship to dull or end, we just drifted apart after high school and didn't reconnect until about 2 years ago. We've been out for coffee, drinks, birthday events, etc. I would say that we are close again. 

Our 10 year high school reunion was this past weekend and I was invited by Ashley specifically. I was excited to go and knew it would be fun touching base with everyone we used to know and hang out with. 

We arrive at the venue and spend about 20 minutes chatting with people, grabbing our drinks, and figuring out the layout of the bar/bathroom/etc. Ashley and I are walking around and I made a comment about a guy that I had a crush on (actively, not in the past). She proceeds to tell me a story about his past and how he gave off ""red flag"" vibes because he tried to hook up with her right after she got out of a relationship (this occurred 10 years ago in high school). I take her seriously and try and respect that she told me the info and leave it at that. 

About an hour later, Ashley and I are comingling with about 6 other people when lo and behold, my crush comes walking up. Ashley proceeds to spend the next 45 minutes focusing her attention solely on this person. I overheard them talking about books, music, her recent breakup, etc. At no point did she make any effort to look at me, speak with me, include me in the conversation. 

I managed to interact with others and enjoy the rest of my time despite the feeling of internally screaming...

Here are a few ideas that are fun, low-pressure, and work well at mixers or networking events:

1. Speed Networking

Set up short 2‚Äì3 minute chats between attendees. Give easy prompts like ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your go-to productivity hack?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs one show you‚Äôre currently watching?‚Äù

2. Business Card Bingo

Hand out bingo cards with boxes like ‚ÄúHas been to Europe,‚Äù ‚ÄúWorks in HR,‚Äù or ‚ÄúLoves coffee.‚Äù Guests have to find people who match the boxes.

3. ‚ÄúThis or That‚Äù Table Cards

Put fun choices on the tables:

1. Coffee or tea?
2. Dogs or cats?
3. In-office or remote?Great conversation starters while people eat or wait.

4. Team Trivia

Mix up the group into teams and ask general or work-related trivia questions. Easy to join and great for building team spirit.

5. Photo Booth + Name Tag Prompts

Set up a photo spot with props. Add ‚ÄúAsk me about‚Ä¶‚Äù stickers or badges like:

What about a modified approach to tipping? I don‚Äôt mind tipping $1-$2 on my regular drip coffee from the local coffee shop. That‚Äôs about 25%.  Or 20% on a cheeseburger at a local diner with good prices. But I don‚Äôt want to pay that same rate at a steakhouse. So I would tip a lower rate (usually 18% but ngl I want to decrease that to 15%)

The reason being the overall compensation that employees earn at these different kinds of establishments differs greatly. A barista is not earning the same as a waiter at a nice steakhouse. But a waiter at a nice steakhouse doesn‚Äôt warrant $50 for one table for 1.5 hours of service.

1mhpxe9,https://i.redd.it/duo6f488j2hf1.jpeg,First kidney stone today,"I (39f) had no idea I had a kidney stone. I have been in agony for 3 weeks. It started with a small twinge in my side then have had pain around my groin for weeks! Thought it was a UTI as ordered urine test kits  and had protein/blood higher than usual acid. 
Saw an out of hours nurse, prescribing paramedic, another nurse (all 3 prescribed me antibiotics) and lab test came back with no infections. No one said kidney stones apart from horrible pain that went in waves and urine tests the only other symptom was blood after wiping.
Last night it felt like something had blocked my wee as it would only trickle out and same this morning. I figured I would have a feel around and could feel a sharp stone in my pee hole! (Same time my dh was crying about a splinter in his finger!) 
I downed 2 big cups of coffee and jumped around loads then pushed so hard when I wee‚Äôd and it finally came out and I could pee properly again it was such a relief! 
This beast is 1cm long - no wonder why I‚Äôve been in so much pain! 
Managed to speak to a Dr who is referring me for a scan (though could take weeks (NHS)) to check my kidneys are ok and did my bloods, she didn‚Äôt want my stone though - do they not test these to see what it‚Äôs made from? (I was still in shock and pain of seeing this stone so forgot to ask) 
Haven‚Äôt been for a pee since as scared it‚Äôll hurt! Should I have gone to A&E for this and at which point, what would they have done? And is it worth paying private for a scan to get seen quicker?

Idk if the intention was ragebaiting or just stirring the UBC reddit pot, but I did get a decent amount of entertainment from this. 

1) It began with [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/1mh4uz4/whats_my_chance_of_getting_housing_this_september/) post where user asked what their odds for getting housing this Septmeber were. Spoiler alert: I don't think user had any ambiguities on their housing status, and based off their numbers, most likely applied to housing sometime last month.

2) It was followed by [this fairly reasonable post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/1mh4wyd/why_does_the_jjbeans_coffee_taste_different_in_a/) about JJ Bean tasting different. No complaints here.

3) User then makes [this post where they state they were an undergrad in 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/1mh50s5/why_is_this_sub_dead/). This doesn't really seem to add up with every other post they've made thus far, but who am I to judge someone taking 10 years to finish their degree.

4) I had a good chuckle from this [post suggesting we combine SFU and UBC with a bullet train](https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/1mh5fqm/school_proposal_combine_ubc_and_sfu/) that has cafeterias and computer labs on it it.

5) A [question](https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/1mh5s5y/r4_vs_99b_line_whch_one_is_more_crowded/) asking which bus was more crowded. Reasonable, until it was followed by 6)[ suggesting we restrict these busses to just UBC students](https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/1mh69jp/transit_idea_make_r4_and_99_b_line_only_boardable/) üò≠üò≠

7) A somewhat reasonable [suggestion to remove first year calculus requirements from certain Sauder programs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/1mh6sca/remove_firstyear_calculus_requirement_for_sauder/)

8) A [question regarding the ownership](https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/1mh712p/how_does_one_get_to_live_on_those_condos_on_ubc/https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/1mh712p/how_does_one_get_to_live_on_those_condos_on_ubc/) of the condos near the law school. A google search might have sufficed, but oh well.

  
User seems to have been going through the stages of grief assosiated with finding Vancouver housing, so valid crashout honestly. If you're Fragrant data then no hard feelings to you lol, just wanted to compile this legendary run",37,1754341780.0,UBC,1,0.91,False

AIO for ending this friendship? 


- Started our planning off with making me entertain an argument over air bnbs vs hotels because she thinks hotels are ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù and she wanted to be able to swim. 
I believe her exact words were, ‚Äúif you get an air bnb at least get one with a pool so I can swim‚Äù 


- She wanted to plan the bach party in full minus a few details but essentially planned a party for herself. 
wanted to split costs for a trip to Colorado but when the rest of us vetoed that idea, she wasn‚Äôt willing to split costs on an air bnb in the city since ‚Äúshe can just go home.‚Äù Offered me her couch for the night as a solution. 


- Argued with my friends and family so much over the bach party/complained about every little detail to the point that I took over and held it at my own house. 
She didn‚Äôt even stay for the whole party because she got ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù when my other best friend started talking about her non-binary sibling. 


- Consistently whined about her boyfriend not proposing to her because she would ‚Äúbe a great wife and mother.‚Äù 
Her basis for this was that a baby would be ‚Äúno big deal‚Äù since she ‚Äúwakes up through the night anyways‚Äù and that her relationship was a whole two years old by that point, as well as the fact that they ‚Äúparent her dog together.‚Äù 


- Overall, ended up barely helping with the wedding minus making sure to get herself a $700 dress to outshine my other friends and making sure to get a bridal hair-do for the day. 
She also made the comment that she can‚Äôt wait for my wedding ‚Äúso she can get a new profile picture out of it.‚Äù 


- Got drunk during rehearsal and then didn‚Äôt stay the night to help finish setting up for the wedding or to be supportive. 


The day of my wedding: 
- asked me to take her to get coffee during my trip to get my hair done; hairdresser convinced her to take a walk to get her coffee. 
- Wanted to ride back with me and almost missed her own hair appointment because of it 
- Hardly participated in wedding activities all day, just stood in the corner with her man minus when she had to be in the ceremony 
- Left the wedding early, right after the photographer of course 


- The morning after, she sent me a message complaining about her boyfriend that was so long it could have been a PDF file. 


- In the days following, she exhibited such attention-seeking behavior that other people were starting to come to me about it 


- The final straw: me and my husband planned a float trip with our closest friends (mostly what consisted of our wedding party), which was supposed to become a tradition from the year prior. Denise, however, decided she wanted to invite 10+ people that none of the rest of us knew. She asked if it was okay and two of us voiced our concerns on wanting a small get-together. Denise then backed out of our float trip, planned her own trip at the same place and time behind our backs, invited my other friends behind my back, then got up early enough the day of to steal our original camping ground as well, out of pure pettiness. 


I blocked her after the float trip ordeal and haven‚Äôt spoken to her since. My other friends say she‚Äôs ‚Äúdevastated‚Äù over our friendship ending. So, AIO? ",2,1754341728.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

1mhpu5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1mhpu5l/no_one_helped_my_grandma_now_i_know_why/,No One Helped My Grandma. Now I Know Why...,"I came back to Coal Creek, West Virginia because no one else would.



My aunt‚Äôs in Florida. My cousins stopped answering the group chat after Grandma asked where their mother was‚Ä¶ for the third time that week. My dad‚Äôs dead. That left me.



She didn‚Äôt need a phone call. Not a ride to the doctor. She needed someone in the house.



Someone to make sure the stove got turned off. Someone to stop her from wandering barefoot into the woods at night.



I wasn‚Äôt the best person for it. Just the last one still breathing who hadn‚Äôt blocked her number.



So I packed a duffel, left a note for my boss, and drove east through the hills until the cell signal dropped and the trees got tall enough to blot out the sky.



The house hadn‚Äôt changed.



Same sagging porch. Same flickering bug light. Same cracked window above the sink where Grandpa put his fist through it in ‚Äò92.



But Grandma had.



Inside smelled like burnt coffee and old lemon cleaner‚Ä¶ Not the bright kind. The kind that burns behind your nose. Bitter and chemical. Like something sour trying to cover something worse.



The floor creaked more than I remembered. The hallway near the bathroom dipped a little‚Ä¶ like the boards were soft underneath. Wallpaper bubbled and peeled near the seams. The living room window had duct tape over one pane, yellowed and curling at the corners‚Ä¶ like nobody had touched it since the Clinton years.



She was in the recliner. Same one Grandpa used to fall asleep in with a beer on his chest. Blanket over her lap. Ashtray full of loose screws beside her. TV off, just reflecting the window behind me in that grey, dead glass.



‚ÄúHey, Grandma‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs me.‚Äù



No answer.



She blinked slow‚Ä¶ eyes cloudy like wet marble.



‚ÄúYou probably don‚Äôt remember I was coming. That‚Äôs okay. I brought your pills and some groceries‚Ä¶ figured I‚Äôd stay a few days.‚Äù



Still nothing. Just that soft scratch-scratch of her nails picking at the blanket.



Then, without turning:



‚ÄúYou smell like your daddy.‚Äù



Her voice was thin‚Ä¶ brittle, like wind through dry grass. Not warm. Not angry. Just‚Ä¶ factual.



I gave a tired smile. ‚ÄúThat a good thing or a bad thing?‚Äù



She didn‚Äôt answer.



Her gaze stayed locked on the dark TV‚Ä¶ like it was showing her something I couldn‚Äôt see.



I moved toward the kitchen to put the groceries away‚Ä¶ left her sitting there in the chair.



I was halfway through putting cans in the cupboard when I heard her voice again‚Ä¶ low and quiet:



‚ÄúHe came back‚Ä¶ I told you he would‚Ä¶ no, don‚Äôt start crying now‚Ä¶ I told you, didn‚Äôt I?‚Äù



I peeked around the corner.



She was still facing the blank TV. Still alone. Still whispering.



I slept in the back room. Used to be my dad‚Äôs when he was a kid. Twin mattress on a metal frame. Same thin yellow sheets with faded cowboy prints. Same dresser with the broken top drawer that always slid open a few inches on its own.



The air back there felt‚Ä¶ wrong.



Heavy. Like it didn‚Äôt want to move unless you gave it permission.



I cracked the window and laid down with my hoodie as a pillow. No fan. Just that old stillness you only get in houses where people die slow.



I could hear her down the hall for a while‚Ä¶ mumbling. Not loud enough to make out the words. Just a steady drone. Like someone praying underwater.



At one point she laughed. Sharp. Sudden. Like someone had whispered a joke in her ear.



It stopped after a while. I guess she fell asleep. I tried to do the same.



The dreams were strange.



Pressure and heat‚Ä¶ like something heavy was sitting on my chest. The sound of water running behind the walls. A breath that wasn‚Äôt mine‚Ä¶ brushing close to my ear.



It didn‚Äôt feel like sleep. It felt like being held under.



I woke up with my heart hammering.



The room was dark‚Ä¶ still. But the door was cracked open now.



I know I closed it.



For a second, I thought I saw something‚Ä¶ a shape in the hallway. Short. Slouched. Leaning forward like it was listening.



I sat up.



‚ÄúGrandma‚Ä¶?‚Äù



The shape shifted‚Ä¶ stepped into the low light spilling in through the living room window.



It was her.



Thin housecoat. Eyes wide and glassy. Arms limp at her sides. Just standing there, staring in at me like she didn‚Äôt know who I was.



I got up slow‚Ä¶ eased toward her.



‚ÄúYou okay‚Ä¶? You need something?‚Äù



She flinched when I got close. Didn‚Äôt speak. Just turned and shuffled back down the hall barefoot, muttering something too low to catch.



I watched her bedroom door close behind her.



Didn‚Äôt sleep much after that.



She was quiet most of the afternoon. Sat in the recliner watching static again‚Ä¶ TV off, remote untouched. Just staring at the glass.



I cleaned a little. Hauled some junk mail to the burn barrel out back. Tried not to look at the woods too long. They weren‚Äôt scary. Just‚Ä¶ dense. Claustrophobic in the daytime. Black by five.



I passed the bathroom on the way back to the guest room.



Door cracked. Light on.



I heard snipping. Quick. Rhythmic. Sharp little metallic bites.



Snip‚Ä¶ snip‚Ä¶ snip.



‚ÄúGrandma‚Ä¶?‚Äù



No answer.



I pushed the door open slow.



She was sitting on the toilet lid, hunched over her lap. One hand holding a tissue. The other‚Ä¶ nail clippers.



Her foot was up on a stool. Bare. Shaking. She wasn‚Äôt trimming. She was cutting.



All the way down. Past the white. Past the pink. Into the bed.



The big toe was already bleeding. The nail split and pulped‚Ä¶ jagged like cracked tile.



She didn‚Äôt flinch. Just kept snipping. Eyes unfocused. Mouth moving with a little tune I couldn‚Äôt place.



Snip‚Ä¶ snip‚Ä¶ snip.



‚ÄúGrandma, stop‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre gonna hurt yourself.‚Äù



She didn‚Äôt look up.



‚ÄúIt grows back if you let it‚Ä¶ just keeps coming back‚Ä¶‚Äù



Then she looked at me. Real sudden.



Eyes wide. Red-rimmed. Wet like she‚Äôd just been crying‚Ä¶ except there were no tears. Just that shaky smile people make when they‚Äôve been alone too long.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got your daddy‚Äôs feet‚Ä¶ I always hated that about him.‚Äù



She was different the next day. Quieter. But twitchy. Kept folding and unfolding a dishrag with her thumbs like she didn‚Äôt know where she was. Her teeth clicked. She wouldn‚Äôt eat.



I offered soup. Crackers. A protein shake. She wouldn‚Äôt touch any of it.



Just stared at the window over the sink and said‚Ä¶



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too cold for him out there‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt want him stiff before we get the nails in.‚Äù



I stopped moving. She didn‚Äôt even look at me.



‚ÄúGrandma, what‚Ä¶?‚Äù



She blinked. Looked confused. Looked at me, but through me.



‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you put your hair up like that for? You know how he gets.‚Äù



Then she started crying. Real tears this time. Covered her face and whispered I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm sorry, over and over like she didn‚Äôt know why.



I helped her back to bed. She went easy. Didn‚Äôt fight or mutter. Just let me tuck her in and stared at the ceiling like it was showing her something I couldn‚Äôt see.



She was out cold by ten.



I couldn‚Äôt sleep.



The house was too quiet. That kind of quiet where you can hear it‚Ä¶ like pressure behind your ears.



I left the door cracked. Just a little. In case she called for me.



Around 1:30, I heard movement. A soft creak. Another.



I thought she was up again. Maybe headed to the bathroom. Maybe just wandering.



I stepped into the hall.



Her door was still shut. The light was off.



But the living room‚Ä¶



The recliner was rocking.



Just slowly. A soft, steady creeeee‚Äîcreeeee‚Äîcreeeee. Like a kid pushing themselves in time with a lullaby.



Nobody was in it.



I stared too long. Didn‚Äôt move.



I walked up close. Real slow. Every board creaking like it didn‚Äôt want me near.



There was something on the cushion.



Not a coin. Not a crumb.



A fingernail.



Fresh. Pale. Split down the middle. The kind of rip that doesn‚Äôt happen by accident.



The rocking stopped the second I picked it up.



No wind. No movement.



Just the TV flickering blue in the corner. Still unplugged.



The next morning she was already awake. Sitting stiff in her rocker like she‚Äôd never gone to bed at all.



No TV. No radio. Just the low scrape of her nails against the armrest.



She was humming again.



Same tune as before. Something slow. Maybe a church thing. Or maybe just something she made up.



I brought her oatmeal. Hoped the warmth might pull her back into herself.



She didn‚Äôt look up.



‚ÄúThey always name ‚Äòem,‚Äù she said.



Voice flat. Not talking to me. Just‚Ä¶ out loud.



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where it goes wrong. You give it a name, you start thinking it means something. Don‚Äôt give animals names. Makes it harder to bury ‚Äôem.‚Äù



She scooped a spoonful of oatmeal and brought it to her lips like nothing was wrong. Chewed. Swallowed. Looked at me, finally.



‚ÄúDid you check the lock on the shed? The wind was up last night.‚Äù



I hadn‚Äôt. Didn‚Äôt even know it had a lock.



I just nodded and said yeah, I would.



She smiled. Real soft. Almost proud.



Then went back to humming.



It was just after midnight when I heard the screen door creak. I hadn‚Äôt been sleeping well. Dad‚Äôs old mattress was rather thin. And the smell of that house‚Äîmothballs and old piss and something worse underneath‚Äîclung to the roof of my mouth no matter how many times I brushed my teeth.



I sat up. Wiped the sweat from my chest. Listened.



No wind. No bugs. Just the hum of the fridge and the slow groan of something settling on the back deck.



I cracked the curtain open.



Grandma was out there. Barefoot. Nightgown hanging loose off one shoulder. Standing still in the dark like she‚Äôd been poured into it.



In her hands were the shears. Not kitchen scissors. Not hedge trimmers. The old iron kind. The farm kind. Rust like dried blood flaked down the handles. Blades long enough to snip a chicken‚Äôs head off clean.



She wasn‚Äôt cutting anything. Just holding them. Arms low and relaxed. Like someone waiting their turn.



She was humming again.



I didn‚Äôt go out. Didn‚Äôt call her name. Just stood there‚Ä¶ curtain pinched between my fingers‚Ä¶ watching the soft sway of her shoulders as she turned and walked back inside.



She never looked at me. But she set the shears on the kitchen counter before going back to bed.



I didn‚Äôt touch them. I couldn‚Äôt.



She died on a Thursday.



No screams. No fall. Just‚Ä¶ gone.



I found her in bed, curled into the blanket like a child. One hand tucked under her chin. Mouth slack. Eyes open.



The hospice nurse said it was peaceful. I believed her.



There wasn‚Äôt a service. The county buried her next to Grandpa at the edge of Coal Creek Cemetery‚Äîno headstone, just a brass tag and a mound of disturbed dirt. No one else came.



I stayed behind to pack the house.



Three days of dust, mildew, and silence thick enough to chew. Moth-eaten dresses. Expired pills. Jars of paperclips sorted by size. Granny‚Äôs mind had left long before her body did.



Then I found the box. Wrapped in butcher paper. Duct tape peeling. Tucked deep under her bed like a secret that didn‚Äôt want to be remembered.



Inside were photos.



Stacks of them.



Not Polaroids. Not prints. These were darkroom-developed, edge-curled, yellowed at the corners‚Äîdecades old.



They weren‚Äôt family photos.



No birthdays. No cookouts. Just bodies.



Kneeling. Bound. Dressed in clothes that looked local‚Ä¶ Coal Creek diner uniforms, Sunday dresses, feedstore overalls.



Some of them were gagged. All of them were hurt.



Eyes swollen. Teeth missing. Arms bruised from restraint.



And in every third or fourth picture‚Ä¶ Grandma.



Grinning. Hair done. Makeup heavy. Holding a leather belt in both hands like she was about to teach a lesson.



Then came the final photo. I swear I can still see it when I blink.



She posed in the rocker like she wanted the photo to seduce someone‚Äîlegs open, lace clinging to her hips, a severed head nestled where a lover‚Äôs face might go. One stocking was rolled down. Her panties were bunched around one ankle like she‚Äôd peeled them off slow. If the head wasn‚Äôt there, I swear to God‚Ä¶



That‚Äôs when I noticed the background.



Behind the chair‚Ä¶ the shape of a window. A wooden wall. A hanging tool.



The shed.



Not just any shed. Her shed. The one behind the house. The one with a padlock so rusted it looked fossilized.



I didn‚Äôt think. I just grabbed a flashlight and headed for the door.



The padlock came off with one tug. I don‚Äôt think she even locked it.



The door groaned on the hinge like something breathing shallow.



I stood there for a second, flashlight trembling in my grip, breathing in mold and cold dirt.



The shed wasn‚Äôt big‚Äîmaybe ten by ten‚Äîbut it felt deeper than it should‚Äôve been. Like there was weight in the air. Something that wanted to be left alone.



I stepped inside.



The light swept across stacked crates, rusted tools, a workbench stained the color of old liver. There were flies‚Ä¶ slow, drunken ones‚Ä¶ buzzing in lazy loops.



And then the jars.



Four of them.



Mason jars. Dust-caked. Unlabeled. Sealed with wax.



One held a shriveled tongue‚Ä¶ gray and curled like something chewed and spat out. Another was full of teeth, floating like pearls in a yellow brine. The third had what looked like three fingers, swollen and pickled, the nails blackened and split.



The last jar was worse.



Not for what was in it‚Ä¶ but what wasn‚Äôt.



Just murk. A fog of rot.



I turned to the workbench.



There was a wooden box with an old 8mm film reel inside‚Ä¶ labeled in pen: For Later.



Beside it: A roll of leather straps, stained dark. A pair of rusted shears. A folded apron, stiff with dried blood.



Not splatter. Not a stain. Soaked. Front to back. Like someone wore it while butchering something that screamed.



I couldn‚Äôt breathe.



The shed smelled like pennies and vinegar and meat left in the sun.



My knees buckled. I dropped to one hand, coughing into the dirt.



There were scratch marks on the inside of the door. Fingernail-deep. Like someone tried to claw their way out.



And then I heard it.



A creak.



Slow. Rhythmic.



From the house.



From the rocking chair.



The house was still dark when I stepped back inside. I didn‚Äôt turn on any lights. There was no point. I already knew where the sound was coming from.



The hallway stretched long and still‚Ä¶ smelling like dust and boiled potatoes and the faint copper whiff that clings to old women‚Äôs hair.



The closer I got to the living room, the more I could feel it. That wrong pressure. Like the air was watching me.



I turned the corner.



The rocking chair was moving.



Back and forth. Back and forth. Slow and even. No wind. No draft. Just motion.



There was no one in it.



Just that old, worn afghan folded across the back‚Ä¶ The one she always used to cover her knees. The one that still smelled like her.



I didn‚Äôt move. Didn‚Äôt breathe.



And then‚Ä¶



Her voice.



From the chair. Low. Close. Warm like it used to be.



‚ÄúYou found my things, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù



I couldn‚Äôt speak.



‚ÄúS‚Äôpose you know now.‚Äù



The chair kept rocking. One‚Ä¶ two‚Ä¶ three‚Ä¶



Then it stopped.



Just like that.



The house went still.



The chair‚Äôs empty.



But when I pass that room‚Ä¶ it feels like she‚Äôs grinning at me.



Like she‚Äôs not done.











I thought packing her things would help.



Give me something to do. Something human.



But I just opened a box in her bedroom closet marked ‚ÄúChurch Bazaar 1997.‚Äù



Inside, beneath some folded linens, were laminated newspaper clippings.



Nine in total.



All local. All different years.



1975. 1983. 1997. 2004.



Missing persons.



Some had names circled in red pen. One had ‚Äúliar‚Äù written across the photo.



I don‚Äôt think I can do this much longer.









I decided to read one of the articles.



‚ÄúBody Found Near Sugar Creek ‚Äî Victim Remains Unidentified.‚Äù



Dated 1975.



The man was in his forties. No ID. No wallet.



Head missing.



She underlined that part.



Then, in the margin, in her handwriting:



‚ÄúIt was still warm when I kissed it.‚Äù



I don‚Äôt even know if I read the whole thing. I got to that line and just‚Ä¶ closed the lid.



It‚Äôs still sitting in the kitchen. I haven‚Äôt moved it.







That night I slept on the couch.



Right there across from the rocker.



I told myself I‚Äôd go first thing in the morning.



But I think I already knew I wouldn‚Äôt.



Then I woke up to the smell of breakfast.



Sausage, eggs, toast with blackberry jam. Just how she used to make it.



I followed the smell into the kitchen.



The stove was cold.



The table was empty‚Ä¶ except for the belt.



Folded. Centered.



I didn‚Äôt touch it.



I just sat in the car with the door open until the sun came up.



I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm protecting anymore.



But I can‚Äôt stay here.

1mhpsvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1mhpsvh/aio_to_swimming_toddlers/,AIO to swimming toddlers,"Some awful things happened to my older kids from simple lack of attention, not every time, but most times due to my ex husband lack of attention and blatant neglect, irresponsible behaviours and a general carelessness. 
I learned to keep all my kids with me, at all times to prevent any further harm until they were old enough that I could finally just leave the loser ex and they could babysit themselves when they were with him. Even then, sometimes they‚Äôd still come home, hurt. Nothing could ever be done about him.
Some of the problem was that I do just have some very accident-prone over-active kids. Those kids are older now, mostly grown up but I still have 2 older teens living with me who still hurt themselves and make silly mistakes. 
Thankfully none of them died, and have turned out to be really great people, and a lot of that has to do with the mentorship of now-hubby, (their stepdad) Though even now I still worry about the adult children. Especially when they share stories of their adventures. lol
I‚Äôm back at the beginning with 3 little ones with my now-husband. 2 are still toddler/preschool and one is 7. 
I do try to assess risk, regularly. Having experienced so much of what can happen seemingly with no warning. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm excessive. I just don‚Äôt go out of my way to put them in harm‚Äôs way, but maybe I am excessive. 
I don‚Äôt go out very often. Maybe two or three times a month, usually just for groceries, WITH hubby.
I do request that he takes the babies out sometimes, just because they are always with me, day and night‚Ä¶and there is a park a block away. 
He does, also a couple times a month, just so I can do some things at home without tripping over them. 
The other day he said he‚Äôll just ‚Äòtake them boating‚Äô‚Ä¶by himself.. to ‚Äòhelp‚Äô me. I imagined all sorts of awful things happening to my littles, expressed my fears, and asked to be present if he wanted to take them boating. These littles ones don‚Äôt swim. They wear life jackets -that one tries to wiggle out of constantly. When fishing, they throw their hooks around with their clumsy baby fingers and like to climb up on the side of the boat. One will fall out eventually fall out. Probably even with me present. He‚Äôs very active and can‚Äôt seem to sit even when the boat is moving. He‚Äôs fearless and impulsive, like toddlers and preschoolers are apt to be.
We got into a bit of an argument over it, that I need to take off the bubble wrap. That he‚Äôs not my ex and is more responsible. & He‚Äôs right. He‚Äôs a million times the man, and he isn‚Äôt abusive.. there is no comparison between the two, at all. But it wasn‚Äôt about comparison for me, at all. I just don‚Äôt see why there HAS to be an element of risk for something to be fun. I don‚Äôt need a kid to end up a statistic because we decided we are good and responsible people so the risks don‚Äôt apply to us. I can‚Äôt imagine that anyone who ever has experienced the tragedy of losing a child ever really thought, well, this could happen, if I do xyz, on this day. I argued that there are certain risks that if we take, well, should the unimaginable ever happen, people online aren‚Äôt going to let us forget or forgive ourselves, either. 
I said he could still go, but I want to be there, to be an extra pair of arms. Yeah, it defeats the purpose of giving me time to catch-up at home. (I‚Äôm not a great housekeeper, and I end up distracted and scatterbrained and fall behind, easily.) but my mind would definitely be more at ease. 
Well, he wouldn‚Äôt go. I brought it up a few times and he just sort of ignored me. 
We‚Äôve had almost this exact discussion before.. I guess it‚Äôs better that at least this time he didn‚Äôt jump to ‚Äúwell let‚Äôs just sell the boat and NEVER go on one, AGAIN.‚Äù Like he did a previous time. (I just didn‚Äôt need to be on it with them for hours, til I look relaxed enough, and/or one of the little ones ASKS to go home.)
I did say he could take the 7 yr old by herself and teach her to swim. All summer. We‚Äôve a pool less than a block away. Even if he just took her, and got her to be a strong swimmer, it would relieve a lot of the fears that I have. 3 are too many to keep within an arms distance at all times. 
Well, yesterday I was on the phone (happens maybe once every 2 months, where I‚Äôm on the phone with someone other than my parents, and I don‚Äôt even talk to them every week) and he starts signing something charades-style as I‚Äôm getting off the phone. My interpretation was that he was taking babies to the park. I nodded and he gave a thumbs up and left. Great! The last time he took them to the park, he left his phone at home and didn‚Äôt tell me he was going. When he got back and I questioned him, he shrugged and said he thought I‚Äôd come join them. So this was appreciated. 
Instead I walk out of my room to see my older teenage son, sprinting out the door in swim shorts, he quickly says ‚Äúdad‚Äôs taking us to the pool. I‚Äôm going to help watch babies.‚Äù 
I tell him he better help keep an eye on his siblings, then, and not leave their side. He agrees, and leaves. 
I texted hubby asking if he took all of the babies, and he says yes. I asked if he could handle  all 3, he says ‚Äú(older teen) is there to help‚Äù and I answer ‚Äúso if something happens, (older teen) isn‚Äôt responsible, right?‚Äù But hubby doesn‚Äôt read it, and stops answering me. Kind of getting the impression he waited for me to be occupied enough so he could just sneak out before I could stop him with my concerns. 
I consider just inviting myself if he isn‚Äôt going to, so I can help keep an eye.. maybe even bring one back so it won‚Äôt be too much to handle. Having one of them being at home is easy for me.. they‚Äôre easy to keep occupied, individually. 
An hour of my mind running away from me and I just can‚Äôt take it, I walked over to the pool and see them. The place was all but empty, which was comforting.. just a couple other people away from where hubby, teen, and babies were.. and they were being attentive and having fun. 
So I took a few deeps breaths, finally relaxed, didn‚Äôt confront or go join them. I just went back home and started dinner.
Couple hours later I get a text ‚Äútime for dinner!‚Äù And nothing else. I didn‚Äôt answer. They got home a couple minutes later. Teen bubbled on about babies‚Äô ‚Äúlearning to swim so quickly‚Äù, and how much fun they had. I smiled and said that‚Äôs good.. finished cooking. He started thanking me for cooking and that it smelled so good and that he couldn‚Äôt wait.. he‚Äôs a sweet kid. I think hubby might have said I would be mad, and teen was trying to be upbeat and positive.
I fed everyone, then went to sit in my room and hubby is like pursuing me telling me I look mad and I shrug it off. I started writing all this to see if going over was an overreaction, but he was kind hovering over my shoulder, so I erased it and scrolled fb instead.
He confronted me again, a few minutes later, and says that he thought I would be over to take pictures of them, and why did I seem so unhappy. I said that I did pop over, and saw they were all having fun, He said ‚Äúwow you really don‚Äôt trust me at ALL, do you??‚Äù Little while later he make a comment again, about my quietness. Volunteer the info that his phone was in a locker and he didn‚Äôt see my other texts and was with the kids getting them ready. I agreed that was fine. 
I didn‚Äôt bother saying anything else. He tried a couple more times to get me talking and I‚Äôd just say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs good‚Äù or ‚Äúglad they had fun.‚Äù
He brings me coffee in the morning (we make each other a coffee on his days off. 
 whoever is up first will bring it to the other, in bed. I take it and thank him, and he says ‚Äúyou REALLY don‚Äôt like that I took the kids swimming do you?!‚Äù But I haven‚Äôt said or done *anything*. I didn‚Äôt sleep on the couch, I didn‚Äôt pout, didn‚Äôt yell or confront or say anything at all.. other than those other phrases. So I said ‚Äúit‚Äôs good they got to swim a bit and get used to the water‚Äù and then I asked him if I was mistreating him. He said ‚Äúno‚Äù but that ‚Äúmy energy was off and, idk, different‚Äù well, I‚Äôm not being cold. I‚Äôm just not filling the air with chatter and trying to justify my feelings and requests like I usually do. 
Maybe I‚Äôm checked out. I don‚Äôt know. I feel like maybe there‚Äôs some manipulation, like I‚Äôm supposed to embrace it as him doing me a favour by showing me I had nothing to worry about. 
Guess this turned out to be more of a rant than anything. But, am I overreacting? By going to the pool and watching? I‚Äôm beginning to feel like even a non-reaction is the wrong reaction, and I‚Äôm just feeling tired, now.",1,1754341623.0,AmIOverreacting,0,0.67,False

She‚Äôs got four kids, three daughters and a son. She gets them all stuff and does the basic things a parent should do like feeding them and buying necessities for them. But I notice a kind of tenderness that she shows her son that I don‚Äôt see in the way she treats her daughters. I‚Äôm not saying she‚Äôs downright evil or abusive, it‚Äôs just so different in the way she talks about him. I remember her saying something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be jealous of whoever is going to marry my son.‚Äù Wtf??? Fucking gross. Whenever her son approaches she greets him with open arms. I‚Äôm not saying she shouldn‚Äôt, I‚Äôm just confused why she isn‚Äôt the same way with her daughters. Sometimes she‚Äôd even snap when her daughter tries to make conversation or even not say anything. Like minutes ago, my niece was trying to show her something she did with playdough. She wasn‚Äôt saying anything. I just know damn well if it was her son she‚Äôd praise him like he discovered the cure for cancer or something. Also my niece (about 9 or 10) was having an argument with my nephew (maybe 6) then he hit her and she hit him back and they got in a physical fight. You think my dumbass sister did anything to break that fight? No. She was laughing and telling her son to keep going. My niece wasn‚Äôt in actual danger, but it boiled my blood. I pulled him off of his sister and told him that he was the one that started it. Sister was laughing even more. I yelled at her and called her a misogynist. She was just laughing. That‚Äôs always the way she is when you try to tell her to be a better parent. 

I‚Äôm genuinely so done with her. I hate that she‚Äôs in our house when she has her own. Her kids are always screaming and fighting and anywhere in the house is a goddamn mess except my room where I lock myself in most of the time to avoid any headaches. This part of my rant doesn‚Äôt have anything for the part above but it‚Äôs been bothering me. She gives her youngest daughter black coffee whenever she drinks and there‚Äôs left of it. She gives her kids whole cans of sodas for themselves. You‚Äôre not being a good mom. You‚Äôre not showing them love or spoiling them. You‚Äôre ruining your kids. No bedtimes even when it‚Äôs school. She locks herself in a random room in the house as if running away from her own kids and letting chaos happen. She just makes sure to give them food and the rest will figure itself out. I used to give all my time and energy to tell my nieces and nephews to pick up after themselves. To speak calmly when needing something. Most of the time they even come to me when an argument is happening. I talked to my sister plenty of times and it‚Äôs always in one ear and out the other. I got tired and burned out, so I stopped caring as much. But there are moments like today where I can‚Äôt stop from meddling. I genuinely hope something happens that would wake my sister up. I‚Äôm starting to resent her. I actually said no to going shopping with them because her kids are there. I can‚Äôt handle being around them. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm overreacting or if I‚Äôm being soft. I even one time left the room when my sister was playing Roblox with her son, because my mind couldn‚Äôt bear to see that tenderness that she isn‚Äôt showing her daughters. Even one time she told her son that she started played Roblox with me and she‚Äôs gonna play with him. I said how you about you invite your daughter. She said no no we don‚Äôt want her. In her head, she thought it was a joke. I even brought it up and she said that she doesn‚Äôt remember saying it. I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs gaslighting me or she genuinely doesn‚Äôt remember.

I (28F) moved to a very rural location two years ago for work and am struggling to make friends. I am single after getting out of a relationship about half a year ago. My small village is full of old people, and the closest city is about 1h 30 drive away (in the UK thats a long way!).

My work colleagues are extremely geographically spread, and I am the only woman in our team of 25. All of my colleagues except one, who lives 1h 30 away in the nearby city and is the same age as me (of whom is the focus of this post!) are approximately 60 years old.

I've been trying to make friends with the guy who is the same age as me. He often mentions he is lonely and I know he wants to move away from the city he currently lives in - so figured we could be pals. We are both single.

We've met up quite a few times now outside of work, and I've stayed the night at his place (nothing happened!). When we hang out its always good fun and we get on well. However - he never ever messages me or invites me out. All 5 times we have done an activity or whatever, I have messaged him beforehand. He was even visiting 15 mins down the road from where I live for work but I was the one to ask if he wanted to meet for coffee lol.

His personality is very closed off and shy - other co-workers have made jokes that its like talking to a brick wall. But in the times we've hung out, I've seen his goofy and sassy personality come out and has brought me to tears from laughing. But I just can't shake that maybe he feels pressured to say yes to hanging out? Or am I just wasting my time with someone who isn't interested in making friends? I'd love to get perspective on if I should leave him alone. Thanks!",2,1754341468.0,FriendshipAdvice,1,1.0,False

I would think with any interns, they don't expect much at all, since the point of an internship is that you're there to learn. One firm I visited told me ""we tell our interns, 'do you know what a credit and debit are? Good, let's begin.'"" I have no idea if the firm I got accepted to is like that or not.

I was hunting for an internship for several months, and during this time I was passed on by pretty much every major accounting firm in my area, likely due to my lack of experience. I feel like the only reason I got accepted at the place I did was because of some connections/networking. If I didn't have that, then I am certain there was another candidate with more experience/background in accounting than I have. My first degree wasn't even in accounting! All my accounting knowledge comes from my classes over the last year, and even then I feel like I have trouble retaining a lot of it because it's just soooo much information being thrown at me. I really need to do hands-on work to eventually get it, I think.

What are internships in accounting generally like? They did make sure to tell me I would essentially be doing the same work as any of their regular new hires and not doing coffee runs. I'm just really worried I won't meet their expectations. I obviously don't want to be fired, but they seem like a really good place to work, very flexible, close to home, etc., and I would love to be offered a full position with them afterwards.

Then she divorced her husband (they've been together for 11 years and had two kids) which is sad, a divorce is never easy especially when there are kids involved

She also clearly started to be agressive towards me, she would cut me off a lot more than other people, always reacted when someone complimented me (""and me ? you don't think MY dress is nice ?""), always forgetting to include me in group chat for plans that we collectively discussed (she always insisted on creating the group chat and then always ""forgot"" to add me but I was always added afterwards by other people)

And yet, I got the feeling that everybody liked her, I didn't understand, everybody would talk about her all the time, she would be the focus of attention even when she was not there, people would laugh with her and say things like ""yeah she's a little crazy but she is nice"" And I had to bite my tongue to not say ""you know, someone repeating 50 times a day that they are a nice person does not automatically make them a nice person, can you think of one nice thing she ever did for someone in the company she was not trying to have sex with ? ""

But that's the thing, I never said anything mean to her or about her in her back. Never. I am quite a calm and discreet person, I do not talk badly about people at work, I think it is not the place. I've talked about her with my friends A LOT but never at work. I have held my tongue for two years even when she was trying to get me down. She clearly said several times that I am not funny or too uptight in front of everyobody. Given she talks about her sexual life in front of everybody in the break room and called me uptight when I did not want to share my sex life. She suggested I had nothing going on but it is just that I have casual sex and one night stands quite a bit and Ido not want to have to explain myself in front of my coworkers ? Especially the older ones that could be my parents and that probably would not understand ? and also I am fully satisfied with my sex life to not have to brag about it in front of MY COWORKERS OF ALL PEOPLE ? (also I'm being petty but she went on like three dates in two years and slept with like one of them, BIG DEAL, I'm not shaming her ! but I feel like the amount of hours spent discussing this in break room is now greatly exceeding the amount of time the total intercourse lasted)

BUT I never snapped, I just smiled at her, shrugged and then cracked a dirty joke 5min later. But she did get to me quite a few times and it really annoyed me, she made me feel so small . I started comparing myself to her, not understanding why everybody seemed to like her so much, questionning of I was the boring one after all

Then it switched

I had a massive crush on a coworker and after a few weeks I realized she had the same crush as me but she was not really discreet about it. she would make a lot of sexual jokes to him and about him at work and he asked her to stop several times. Always tried to ask him out, do sports together, go try a new restaurant, cook for him. It was obvious to everybody. She would always cut me off when I was talking to him, once she PHYSICALLY slid between me and him during a coffee break. I AM NOT JOKING  
I've played it cool and stayed myself and I ended up dating him for a month or so, it turned out to not be a match between us and we agreed to not talk about it at work. But he told me once unprompted that he could never date her and that she seemed completely unattractive to him and it is not charitable but god did that make me feel GOOD

Then I've noticed that while people talked a lot about her it was not always in good terms. One of my older colleague talked about her two weeks ago. I really like him, he never said anything mean about anybody that was unjustified but he WENT OFF. Criticising her work, her attitude, her manners, calling her completely crazy and accusing her of making herself look dumb for attention. I was so shocked because I've never heard talk about anybody like that  
A few days ago, it was the birthday party of one of our co-workers, during that party, I caught one of the quitest girl at work sighing I asked her what was wrong, she said ""nothing I've just stood 5min next to \*coworker's name\* and that's too much ! I could'nt take it anymore ! I just need a little bit of air"". The wife of one of my colleague said something similar and added some more not so kind words which was so suprising because she is such a nice person and she barely saw her for five minutes  
Overall I've counted six different people complaining about my co-worker behind her back, some were saying pretty horrendous stuff. And I still said nothing. I even was the only one defending her at some point because everybody was making fun of her and calling her dumb (given she said one of the dumbest s\*\*\* Iv'e ever heard) but people were being so mean to her  
On the same day, I got told by three different coworkers at different times that I was ""a ray of sunshine"", I said jokingly during the party ""it took me a while to understand that you guys said that because I am wearing yellow today"" and one of the girl said ""no I said that earlier because you are always smiling and a joy to be around"" and it clicked  
She caught the attention but her little game is starting to tire, me on the other end, I've stayed myself, nice and also professional and I am pretty confident that I am much more liked than she is, I ended up dating the guy I wanted to date, people call her dumb and sigh when she's here and nobody ever called her a ray of sunshine

>The Weiss-Wiesemann coefficient is a ratio designed to reflect the difference in net worth between individuals. When the coefficient is close to 1 (or 100%) it means one person possesses all the net worth among that group of individuals. It's been observed that when the Weiss-Wiesemann coefficient reaches about .96 or so, the laws of physics begin to bend around the high-net-worth individual.

We know that Harry experiences extreme bending of the laws of physics, and from the encyclopedia skill we can find out that Harry's Weiss-Wiesemann index compared to the MRLBG is "".9998 repeating"", which is why he sees those effects. Kim claims he doesn't see any, saying he just sees a regular guy who is ""unusually well dressed for Martinaise"", which suggests that his coefficient is at worst .96.

In a conversation with the guy, if we ask him ""Really?"" after he claims that he is a single digit billionaire, he admits he lied and there are actually many digits. So let's go with the lowest possible estimate and assume that he has mere 2 digits, or 10 billion.

In this case, accounting for the fact Kim does not observe Weiss-Wiesemann effect, that value should be 96% of his and Kim's combined net worth. Which means the combined would be at least 10 / 0.96 = 10.4 billion ‚ú§, meaning Kim has 400 million in his bank account.

And yet this asshole can't pay for my room at day 2, forcing me to die in a trash can?

>!Come to think of it, even with an index of .(9998) the amount of money Harry should possess is enormous.

¬†

In the Campbell apartment, Maggie slept in her childhood bed. Following the last case, she decided she would be taking a week off of work, all her vacation days for the year. Leila had left her daughter's room nearly untouched since she moved away. Even while she was angry at her daughter for joining the police department instead of going to college, she never did much to the room. The only difference now as compared to ten or so years ago was some storage boxes, put in a place they wouldn't be in the way. Leila walked by her daughter's door, happy to hear the snoring, and content with having another presence in her apartment after so long. Then she was off to work.¬†

The man in room 309 never found peace, and never would for the remaining four days. As Leila was cleaning up the kitchen before the first guests would start coming down for breakfast, he woke up from another one of the countless bouts of sleep-if they could be called that, they were closer to just unconsciousness than any form of rest. The bullet-holes had appeared and disappeared from the spot on his ribs seemingly at random. The snapped collarbone. The busted lip. The blood-doused clothes. The migraine. They all similarly came and went as they pleased, bringing the pain in full each time. He was unsure if he‚Äôd completed a prayer in hours, he went out mid-sentence then woke up and tried to begin again from the last part he remembered, but now he no longer tried. On top of these familiar injuries came new ones, the origins of which he did not know. From each of his tied hands (the left of which he re-bound the day prior), right down the middle of his palm and back-face were large perfectly circular holes. So large he could see straight through them and see the light, wooden yellow brown of the chair. From his feet he also bled, though he could not see through them for they were socked. The holes were implied from the sparkling, wet dark spot in the middle of each, and the way the fabric sunk for about the length of a quarter in the same spot.¬†

As Leila finished up the kitchen and gathered supplies to prepare for the first floor‚Äôs cleaning, the man was three stories up, his injuries all gone for the moment. He was in nothing but reality. With an eerie silence overtaking the room. There was not even coughing or cars driving outside that leaked into the dead atmosphere. It was awfully silent, not even the overwhelming thoughts made his head noisy, nor the migraines that pounded like gongs. Just quiet. Quiet and clear thoughts. The man, through unclouded eyes, looked around the room, not even the fireplace looked odd, just small and dark and dead.

He let the silence flow, it was refreshing, and it dragged his eyelids down in tiredness, now that they were allowed to be tired, but he didn‚Äôt let them fall. Clear-headedness could not be taken for granted, he needed to use the time before inevitably some form of torture, mental or physical, took hold. He needed to get through the prayer. The words came easy to his mind, like his own name, home address, or regular coffee order. He opened his mouth to begin, and the first syllable came out clear and incongruous in the still air. Then the next did not follow. As if he had hesitated or hit a brutal stutter, nothing left his closed throat. He tried again. Nothing.

Panic rose in his throat where the words failed to fill. He kept trying to speak but with each attempt all things going into and out of his throat ceased, no words and no air. He stood, unsure of what to do, his hands clasped over his bobbing Adam's apple. He almost wished that man in black would appear, offering an ultimatum in exchange for his voice; without his voice, after all, he couldn't speak the exorcism. He pushed the thought from his mind immediately, he figured if he thought that *loud enough* that man would hear. The emptiness of the room was shocking, he had always really been alone but now especially it seemed- spiritless, he was truly alone, even the fireplace sat silently. Its furnace and bulging spiral eyes seemed just brass and ash, nothing else to them. The only noise within the room was the man's shuffling, eerie and desperate in the empty room. The man rushed to the bathroom, the blood in his ears the only sound he could hear. It rushed like a water hose, the undertone for his panicked thoughts.

He ran up to the mirror, seeing his wide, bloodshot, panicked eyes immediately. He opened his mouth, hoping to somehow see some obstruction he could remove, but there was none. His stomach twisted suddenly in hunger. The inability to speak and the audible cries from his stomach had to be linked. That man \[SAMUEL THE PIG\] wanted him to eat. He wanted him to eat those bars the priest instructed him to make, just so they could turn once again to dirt or ash in his mouth: somehow furthering whatever ritual the demon was trying to weave into his own. The man stood, hands white knuckling the sides of the sink while the unsettling silence filled the early morning blue of the room.¬†

If the blood in his ears had not been so loud or the thoughts did not rattle noisily and quickly through his head like locomotives to destination unknown, the man would have heard Leila shuffling down the hallway, the rickety cart she pushed ahead of her. The man was out of the bathroom now, throwing the contents of his briefcase aside and onto the floor. *Had he not brought a pen? How could he have forgotten something so simple? Where was the charcoal? That wouldn‚Äôt work.* But there was no such utensil. Hesitating a moment, he grabbed an item from the bag and darted back to the bathroom. He looked at his skeletal and pathetic reflection once more as beads of sweat gathered at his hairline.

He recited the prayer in his head, hoping somehow that that would suffice, raised his right hand to his throat, and sparked the torch lighter.

\#

It took a bit for the flame to bite at his flesh, first he just felt the heat on his thumb, then on his chin as the fumes rose. Some of his sprouting stubble shriveled and evaporated. Then the sting reached its target.

The flesh of his neck seared. The man flinched and pulled the lighter away, taking a moment to wince in pain. He had just begun, there was more to do. He clenched his jaw, looking at the reflection of his upturned face in the mirror. Underneath his jutting chin, was just a single teardrop-like burn. The skin was dark and grayish and wrinkling. He brought his right fingertip to it. He brushed over it and the burnt skin fell away, revealing a pale, unpigmented layer underneath, one that was surrounded by a frame of darkened, burned skin. He raised the lighter again and flicked it twice until the flame maintained. He held it to where the teardrop shape began near the top of his Adam‚Äôs apple.

The pain was no easier than the first time, he heard his teeth scrape nastily against each other, and his eyes watered. Luckily, he did not need to see very well to do his work. This realization, deep in the back of his mind, reminded him of how his mother never did get glasses, for her eyesight was *well enough for all she needed*. He pulled the lighter down slowly, letting the singular flame suck seductively at his neck. His skin darkened and curled away when the flame rested upon it, tracing a line down from his Adams apple to his sternum. When he finished, he pulled his sweating hand to the counter, letting his grip loosen on the five cent lighter. The skin on his neck still tingled, it begged him to scream, which he was almost glad he could not do. The sickly, acrid scent of his own burnt skin floated lightly through the air, seeping into his nostrils. He wiped his sweating hand onto the ridges of his pants and grabbed up the lighter again, not letting himself hesitate, the lighter flicked on first try-the flame reminding him of the ones that filled his childhood room. He let the flame caresse the soft flesh of the left side of his neck, and once again brought it, painstakingly slow to the right. If he should thank his father for anything, it‚Äôd be his pain tolerance.¬†

Finally, he put the lighter down for the last time, letting it skid and center itself in the bowl of the sink. Letting a solitary tear roll down his cheek, he bent over the counter, to get a better look at his handiwork. He brushed the grayish brown skin, it fell off and into the sink, revealing the pale artwork beneath.

The wound leaked clear serum. In harsh contrast with his almond skin was a lopsided and sagging cross shape in bright white and pink. Moving his head any which way caused the shape to shoot burning roots of pain through his neck.

He carefully tried to speak again, afraid that it would not work, and that all that had been for nothing. ‚ÄúSamuel.‚Äù Was spoken, breaking the silence of the room, and as if summoned, the shadows in the room began to begin their mocking, sly movements, and the man was suddenly aware of a slow, heavy breathing seeping into the bathroom, undoubtedly from the fireplace. He wished he would‚Äôve found relief in being able to continue the process, but none was found. His blood still ran as cold as before.¬†

Before he could even begin the prayer again, the pain in his ribs reappeared, the three bullet holes sending a shock through his body. His head snapped back, waking with a start, like a dream in which you've fallen from some incomprehensible height. He tried to stand but realized he could not, he was still tied to the chair. His hands, with the massive quarter-sized hole in each, gripped the thin armrests. The blood from his lap began a slow, sloppy descent to the floor, where it pooled a nasty, dark red. He began to wonder if the morning thus far had just been a dream but the tingling pain on his neck and the smell of his own burnt flesh answered the thought immediately. Too much had happened so far for him to try to understand events in any sort of comprehendible order, but at least he could speak. The man began the prayer once again, the words falling off his tongue like saying his own name. He wished to never say a prayer again once this was all over.¬†

Leila whistled as she approached room 309, room 308 was once again occupied, this time by a single young woman. She reminded her of herself when she was younger, the woman was in the room and didn't require any cleaning. She knocked on the door. She was of course expecting the usual ‚ÄúI'm in here!‚Äù That odd man never did seem to leave. She wondered if she‚Äôd somehow miss him when he left in a couple days. No response did come. She stood for a bit; her graying head tilted to listen. She knocked again- this wouldn't be the first time it took more than one knock for the man of room 309 to answer. He slept deeply, she presumed, and she did come early.

There was a shuffling noise from within. She furrowed her brow and prepared to knock again when something like the beginning of a scream was heard, it was so quick it could be doubted she heard it at all. Just the first high note, the human vocal chords expelling all they could, before it was cut short by a laugh track. The laugh track was clearly the sound of a recording, perhaps playing on some radio or television the room did not have. But the laugh track reverberated from the room loud and solitary. There was no further voice, no shuffling, just the loud and canned laughter of an audience in some studio.

The audio grew louder at some parts then waned into barely audible at others. *Awfully rude,* Leila thought to herself. *He could have just said he was busy, or there at all. Awfully rude to just drown out the knocking with his radio, I was just trying to do my job.* She shook her head, she‚Äôd dealt with much worse. She just continued on pushing her cart. *I guess I won‚Äôt be missing him after all*.

Inside of room 309, the man was lying on the floor. Not in any sort of comfortable, resting position. He was nearly facedown, one arm was twisted behind his back, the other held his structurally ruined ribs. His legs were tangled, and his back was twisted so that he was fetal but his crotch faced sideways. The blood from his ribs, hands and feet formed a puddle of gore beneath him. Each breath he took in was scratchy and required fending off a coughing fit. It was no help that it seemed he took in equal parts oxygen and blood.

He had been lying there for what felt like hours or perhaps even days, when he heard a loud and sudden knocking on the door. *The housekeeper*. He had grown almost numb to the pain and as such his heart had slowed to a lull but the realization of someone being at the door made his eyes widen and his heart begin its marathon once again. The panic froze him, and he did not act until the rapping started once again. Three sharp knocks.

The man tried to lift himself, he was lightheaded and weak. The arm that attempted to support his weight slipped in the puddle of his blood and he fell with a thud onto the soaked carpet. *I can‚Äôt let her come in here, God what would she say about what she sees? The door is locked but she has a master key surely. If she gets in, would she let it out? There is the sigil atop the door, but if she entered,* he *could enter her. There would be no way to explain.* Panic continued to rise, he called out to her, for her not to enter, that he was in here, but the fireplace let out a hearty guffaw that drowned out his cries into some sort of hellish white noise. He watched the door wide-eyed from his pathetic position upon the ground, dreading seeing the doorknob begin to twist, or the sound of keys, or another knock. He warned her again, begging her not to come in. After about another minute, he could hear her large cart, on its rickety wheels, continue its way down the hall.

He breathed a sigh of relief, and let himself down, his face landing with a splat onto the cool blood on the floor. He opened his topmost eye; he could see his crippled and weakening body curled up in the spill. The stain formed an asymmetrical bean-like shape in the middle of the room*. Was there not an identical stain when I first entered? No, it couldn't have been, I‚Äôm bleeding now, aren't I? The stain couldn‚Äôt have been here before. It couldn‚Äôt* \-in his head flashed a vision of his view of the hotel room floor, except he was staring blankly at the large brown stain, it had no blood, and there was no pain. Then the vision flicked away before he could even grasp it, and it was instantly forgotten-*have. How would I wash out this stain before I leave? God, I‚Äôd have to survive first, I‚Äôm worrying entirely about the wrong things.* As the man tried to gather his thoughts to pull himself together, his consciousness flickered out like a light and he woke up minutes later.

Like his vision flickered out, it flickered in one flash at a time. His brain comprehending what his eyes were receiving in pieces: disconnected, nonsensical pieces. His brain worked to first recognize that he was lying on the ground, though the room was mirrored in on itself, one dark and the other far too bright.

Then he came to realize the dark reflection was the one on the still surface of the not-yet-dry blood. As he became aware of the room's unnatural brightness, he slowly turned his rigid neck, allowing himself a slightly broader view.

There were two pillars of light on the ground, like two lamps or bulbs sitting on the floor in front of him. From them radiated a great warmth. The man hefted himself up to a leaning position in which he could see before him.

It was a full being. A being of light and warmth. The man looked at the thing with wide eyes. It was truly a man of perfection. In that moment he understood what it meant to be made in God's image. For the being resembled himself, but he also resembled every other man or woman he‚Äôd ever seen just the same. Familiar, homely, kind, safe, trusted, trusting, *warm*. The man grabbed the thing by its neck.¬†

As his hands closed a vice-grip on the scorching neck of the glowing being, his body twisted backward like a man electrocuted, and his psyche was thrown from his body. He saw in third person himself frozen in time, arms outstretched, hands clasped around the beings throat, and his own spine bending in an arch while the being stood glorious and dignified before him.

All was frozen, time did not move, then it all started moving far too fast. The man of light warped like an image on a television glitching from scene to scene, his body twitched and flickered, and grew into the man in black. The cool smile upon his blackened face. There was noise- so much noise. It started just as the thoughts in his head and perhaps the blood in his ears, it turned to radio static, then turned to canned laughter. From the laughter it became the ambient sounds of a party, the people talking. Lots and lots of people. The room sounded as if it were packed with a party of a hundred or more. Then there was the whooping of celebration, and from that came music, a horrid, scratching, fast paced, *nervous* music. The whooping, talking and stirring of the music crescendoed until the very noise itself seemed to make the room fill with presence. The very room seemed to vibrate, gyrate and shake back and forth wildly, and as the man stumbled trying to understand what was happening, he saw there was movement in the room. There were bodies in the room. Others.

They were flailing every which way, limbs in denim, cloth, corduroy, flying in every direction with no reason or rhythm. There was chaotic dancing, the dancing of hundreds of bodies, surrounding the man and paying him no mind as they danced their frenzied dance to the rapid and pandemonic music. The man‚Äôs head whipped side to side, trying to understand while working to maintain his balance among the thrashing bodies, as he steadied himself of the bumping from every angle, he began to catch better glimpses as the bodies. They were lifeless, non-human, there was no flesh, just fabric. They were ragdolls: their motionless smiling faces were potato-sacks with button eyes, their outfits were miscellaneous cuts of other pieces of clothing, their hair were strips of black or orange cloth. All of their limbs: arms, legs, necks, hair were swinging and whipping in a frenzy.

¬†The man thought he was hyperventilating as he failed to breathe in, before a bitter taste seeped onto his tongue causing him to spit. He spewed a powdered brown onto the back of two ragdolls in front of him. His mind whirled as the ragdolls did, the room was spinning and the man was getting more and more nauseous by the second. He puked again, and this time saw that it was fully dry, the dirt again. *I didn't even eat,* he thought weakly as he bent over to throw up again, but a denim limb knocked him to his knees.

With shaking legs, a sweating face, and dirt around his chin, the man slowly stood up, wishing that awful loud music would end. He tried to push through the erratic, thrashing crowd, the bodies of cloth and cotton were surprisingly solid and heavy, and required all the effort of jostling through a riot of real people.¬† He spewed the dry soil once more, it found its target the feet of a red haired doll, the bitter taste remained in his mouth and grit stayed under his tongue. The man figured if he could find his way to the bathroom somehow, it may be empty, it may have not yet been affected by the chaos of the surrounding room. He stumbled and shoved weakly, until he saw a gap in the human-sized dolls. They all left a large gap near the edge of the room. He used the last of his waning strength to reach the break in bodies. Finally pushing past the last line of swinging limbs he saw another body on the floor, bent over on bended knees, hands laid on the ground before it and its forehead to the ground. It was dressed entirely in black, its head a pale white. It brought its upper body up, still kneeling, still looking forward. The man took two slow steps to the side to get a better look at it. As he did so he realized it was no ragdoll, though it was just as lifeless. It was a skeleton, dressed in a pristine baggy cassock. It had its bone hands clasped in prayer. As the man looked at the uniform of black with a white collar and the skeleton flickered. It filled the robe; flesh made it bulge and the white of the skull disappeared and was replaced with a purple and yellow bruise-like skin color. Just as he had expected, the man in the uniform was one Father Mark Kirkland.

His face was pudgy, far more pudgy than the man remembered. His lips were swollen, puckered and purple. His eyes were glassy and one sagged in its own direction. There was rotten food, white and blue with fuzzy mold leaking from his bottom lip to the chest of his black robe. His neck was squeezed by the white collar, its fat rolls pushed out of the top. His belly protruded from within the uniform, large, round and bulging. He shuddered and recalled that the priest did eat himself to death, gluttony, died in a sin.

The man found it hard to look at the man he knew from so many years ago in this way, but Father Kirkland‚Äôs visage paid him no mind at all. He closed his listless eyes and lowered his head to the ground once more, becoming just a skeleton once again. The man moved his eyes from the praying figure of his past to what was before it: what it was praying to.

It was the fireplace. Its bulging spirals filled with hate, its mouth wide and dark, an abyss that he half expected a forked tongue to flick from. No tongue came, but that haunting deep laugh rolled out of it, above the horrid music, making the entire room shake. All the pain of the wounds caught up to the man at once. The bullet holes reappeared, the holes in his hands and feet popped back into existence, erasing his flesh, his neck stung with third degree burns and infection, his head felt as though someone had brought a sledgehammer to it, and he threw himself to the ground as he tried not to vomit again. His kneeling body looked eerily similar to the skeletal priest of his past.

The man looked up at the massive fireplace that had gained such size it towered above the thrashing crowd; it looked as if it could swallow everything in the room whole.

He heard a slight buzz zip past his ear. He could make out the tiniest bit of motion circling in front of him. The black dot zoomed past all of the dancing ragdolls, past the priest, and through the loud air of the room. The fly landed on the fireplace‚Äôs tongue. The fly landed on the bleeding stone. The man stuttered through his desperate breaths, he coughed violently, half expecting blood to come up with any of the painful hackings. He first reached for his tie, the thin polyester, then his sleeve, his heart rate was not slowing. He felt the leather of his belt and then the ridged cotton of the corduroy. Everything was still moving, nothing had changed, he rubbed his palm across the surface of his pants, still nothing. He was moving, he could feel everything, he could see everything, *why isn't this working? Polyester tie. Cotton shirt, corduroy pant*s. He could hardly breathe through his panic, *Corduroy pants, corduroy pants, blood. Theres so much blood.* He paused for a second, silent in a room of pandemonium. Then, he reached behind himself, grasping at the back of his waistline. His hands closed around cold-metal. He pulled the snub-nose from its place. It was too late. He had lost it. He had lost. There was no regaining control now. The demon \[-THE PIG\] had won. There was only one option left. It was too late. May God judge his soul by his intent instead of his actions. He turned his eyes, which were tearing up in pain, to the gun before he would hold it to his temple. It was not steel any longer.

The gun was wooden. The old toy colt. There were tiny bloody fingerprints on the walnut handle. The man stared at it as his vision blurred and the frantic dancing mocked him in his peripheral. A stuffed, flannel arm hit his shoulder and the gun fell to the ground and was kicked into the crowd by feverish, writhing feet.¬†",1,1754341007.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1mhpioz,https://www.reddit.com/r/northernireland/comments/1mhpioz/warning_about_hiring_people_from_here/,Warning about hiring people from here,"(I posted this earlier then removed it as I don't like slating people, nor do I want to get into a public discourse with them, but I feel too strongly about this. I feel taken for an absolute fool).

I just wanted to share this so that people don't make the same mistake I did. I'm not going to name them but they're easy to find.

Often people advertise their services on here. Recently, a husband and wife cleaning team have been advertising their business. They say they have 15 years between them but they don't exist online, apart from a new generic site with a random photo, and have no reviews to check. However, I was taken in by their understanding tone, and that they specifically mentioned bereavement and disability, both of which we're currently dealing with in my house and which is part of the reason we wanted a deep clean. 

They offered a 3 hour slot for ¬£45 an hour deep clean for first time cleans and houses that need extra attention (their words) and sent a list of what this entailed. To be honest, I was skeptical of what they could do in 6 man hours of time, but figured, they are professionals and wouldn't send me an unrealistic list. 

I sent photos in advance which they said, that's no bother. I spent the week decluttering and clearing surfaces (including as much as possible in the kitchen, when we were still using our coffee, air fryer etc, but took down everything from tops of cupboards for example). 

This is the list of what they said was included in that (I didn't make this list - because people aren't reading this is THEIR LIST they sent me, not a list I made for them!)

Includes:

	‚Ä¢	Dusting all surfaces (skirting boards, doors, switches, picture frames) 

	‚Ä¢	Cleaning behind/under furniture (where accessible)
 
	‚Ä¢	Full kitchen clean (outside of cupboards & appliances) 

	‚Ä¢	Inside kitchen cupboards/drawers (if emptied) 

	‚Ä¢	Oven & extractor fan clean 

	‚Ä¢	Inside fridge/freezer (if defrosted) 

	‚Ä¢	Deep bathroom clean (tiles, grout, taps, toilet, shower screens) 

	‚Ä¢	Limescale removal from taps & shower heads 

	‚Ä¢	Vacuuming & mopping all floors 

	‚Ä¢	Cobweb removal

	‚Ä¢	Inside windows (reachable) 

	‚Ä¢	Window sills & tracks

	‚Ä¢	Wiping walls & door frames

	‚Ä¢	Washing skirting boards & radiators

	‚Ä¢	Disinfecting bins (indoor)

	‚Ä¢	Cleaning interior glass (e.g. cabinet doors)

	‚Ä¢	Mattress vacuuming & freshening

	‚Ä¢	Upholstery vacuuming/wipe-down

	‚Ä¢	Bed changing (clean linen provided by client)

	‚Ä¢	Pet hair & odour removal

	‚Ä¢	High-touch areas sanitised (handles, switches, remotes)

	‚Ä¢	Spot-cleaning walls or floors


What they actually did in those 6 hours:

Cleaned inside and outside kitchen cupboards (not drawers, ignored those) They said this took so long because we had a lot of spices. But we had grouped spices in containers. I had specifically asked in our text messages whether they wanted me to empty the cupboards in advance and they said no.

Cleaned kitchen surfaces.

 Didn't clean behind anything. Didn't clean inside or outside the fridge or oven.

They didn't properly clean the kitchen floor - for example, didn't move the bin to clean underneath it. Didn't take the bin out either.

They didn't clean any of the kitchen kickboards.

Cleaned kitchen tiles - I did specifically ask for this as I want to paint them.

Cleaned inside kitchen windows

Mopped dining room floor - didn't hoover it, there was litter the cat had kicked out of a freshly cleaned, totally clean litter tray on the floor. They'd mopped over it.

Hoovered and mopped living room floor, wiped the top of a kallax.


That's all.

In the kitchen, they didn't clean the fridge or oven. I wouldn't have been so gutted and upset if at least the kitchen was properly clean. At least I'd have paid for a lovely clean sparkly kitchen.

They didn't clean anything else in the house or go upstairs at all.

I ended up having to do it all myself. I should have just done it all myself anyway. But I thought a deep clean would be a really good thing to do and then help us keep it going.

They were not apologetic. They charged me full price, didn't offer any discount. Most offensively of all to me, when I communicated how upset and disappointed I was, they pressured me to pay the invoice and then said they could come next week if I did, and they'd charge me a special rate to do the rest. They framed this as them being supportive of me, rather than them not doing the actual job I paid them for. 

We are dealing with a lot in this house right now and this was meant to take the pressure off rather than add it. My plan was to get a deep clean then keep someone on. Their initial offer to me was just that, a deep clean followed by a ¬£35 hour follow up clean. Which makes me wonder if the short slots are deliberate.

I am gutted and feel totally let down. I paid the full invoice because frankly I didn't have the energy to argue. Now I deeply regret this and feel like at the very least I should have paid their standard cleaning rate and not deep cleaning one.

Maybe this was a one off, maybe theyre normally good. But to do next to nothing, do the little they do badly, charge me full price and then try to emotionally manipulate me into paying them more and framing it as them doing me a favour has felt horrible. 

I feel incredibly stupid for going with a company who have no online presence, no online reviews, no personal recommendations and just taking them at their word. If they were online, I'd have left a negative review like people do for businesses. My posting here feels more personal than I am comfortable with, but I want to warn others.

Please don't make the same mistake I did and hire randoms from Reddit. Do your research.

Sometimes the posters (and even the titles) feel misleading, not in a malicious way, but in how dramatically different the tone and style of the poster is compared to what the show is actually about.

Let me explain: I‚Äôll see a poster with characters in dramatic poses, backlit by celestial light, space themes, intense typography and I‚Äôll think, ‚ÄúThis must be some sci-fi fantasy epic.‚Äù Then I hit play and it turns out to be a light office romance. Like‚Ä¶ what?

Even the titles can throw you off. You might get something like Celestial Fight or Moonlight Vow, and think you‚Äôre getting magic and warriors, but it‚Äôs just a story about two coworkers learning to open up emotionally over coffee.

I get that a lot of this is cultural, there may be metaphor, symbolism, or poetic phrasing that has deep meaning in Korean culture that doesn‚Äôt translate directly. Maybe that flamboyant, artistic expression is part of the appeal.

Still, as a Western viewer, it can be super confusing. Has anyone else noticed this? Is it just me?",1,1754340931.0,kdramas,0,0.6,False

1mhpetu,https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/1mhpetu/separation_anxiety_when_outside_the_house/,Separation Anxiety when Outside the house,"I have an 11 month old min pin who, I think is naturally, just an anxious guy. I have tried so hard gradual separation training and he seems to do okay 50% of the time. He is crated when no one is home (never left alone for more than 4 hours) and he either sleeps or he barks nonstop. He has also unfortunately started peeing in his crate, which is more of a nuisance because I have to constantly wash pee blankets. 

I have tried leaving him out of his crate in our gated living room when I have stuff to do outside and I hear him howl for 5-10 minutes and then he lays down. 

Anyways, this question is more about when my partner and I are out of the house with the puppy. I‚Äôm not sure when, maybe a few months ago, but he began to be very anxious in the car and outside on trips. Nothing traumatic happened. I try to take him with me every morning to drive and get coffee in hopes he settles down in the car. He has yet to and it‚Äôs been a few months. Additionally, if I or my partner get out of the car he screams bloody murder. Or if we are walking in town and one of us goes into a store while the other waits outside with him‚Ä¶ you would think one of us is doing something horrible to him with the screeches he makes. I‚Äôve tried everything, positive reinforcement, treats, redirecting, ignoring and then only giving into attention when he‚Äôs calmed down. 

I am a little frustrated that it feels like nothing is working and this guy is just a little ball of nerves that can‚Äôt be taken anywhere and can‚Äôt be left alone at home. I also do genuinely feel bad for him that he gets himself so worked up. I am also due with my first baby in 3 weeks, so potentially his nerves have been made worse by whatever hormones he‚Äôs picking up on me. We have done other training, sit stay etc and he does pretty well with that.

Any advice? Thank you!",2,1754340745.0,puppy101,2,1.0,False
1mhpebl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundShape/comments/1mhpebl/reveal_the_truth_about_best_wireless_headphones/,Reveal the Truth About Best Wireless Headphones QCY H3 ANC,"Using the QCY H3 ANC Bluetooth headphones for a few weeks now, I can confidently say these are an impressive pair of over-ear headphones with a mix of stellar features and minor quirks. Being a sucker for both high-quality sound and comfortable design, I was intrigued to see how this model would hold up. Here's my take on the highlights, quirks, and overall experience with these wireless headphones.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
These headphones don‚Äôt just sound premium, they also look the part. The lightweight design is practical, yet sturdy enough to not feel flimsy. The earcups, covered in synthetic protein leather, provide enhanced ventilation so my ears didn‚Äôt feel hot even after hours of wear. The memory foam cushions make them super comfortable as they gently mold around the ears. The foldable design means they don‚Äôt hog space in my bag when I‚Äôm carrying them around. However, I noticed that the plastic frame feels decent but might not be ideal for someone who‚Äôs hard on their gear. 

**Sound Performance**  
What really stood out was the sound experience. The headphones come equipped with oversized 40mm dynamic drivers, and trust me, the audio delivers. Whether I played bass-heavy tracks or acoustic ballads, the clarity was impressive. The frequency response range of 40 kHz truly enhances the audio‚Äôs richness. When listening to high-res tracks, it felt like being enveloped in a mini audio bubble. Though, if you‚Äôre an audiophile with instrument-precise ears, you might find that the mids can feel slightly recessed compared to the deep bass and crisp highs.  

**Adaptive Active Noise Canceling**  
Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) on these Bluetooth headphones is surprisingly customizable. The QCY app gives you control to adjust levels and toggle between modes like Indoor, Commuting, Boosted, and even Anti-Wind-Noise. I used them while working in a coffee shop, and switching to ""Boosted"" mode completely shut out the loud chatter. That said, ANC effectiveness heavily depends on your surroundings. While it worked like a charm indoors, on a windy bus stop, you could still hear faint gusts creeping through. 

[Check QCY H3 ANC price on Amazon.](https://visionhut.com/p/b0cfzst5dv/)  

**Battery Life**  
Battery life is where these headphones shine. With ANC off, you get up to 60 hours of playback, which is absolutely insane. Even with ANC turned on, I managed a solid couple of days of intermittent usage before needing to recharge. They also include a 3.5mm audio cable for wired listening when the battery inevitably gives out during long trips. That simple feature meant I didn‚Äôt have to stress about running out of battery mid-playlist. 

**Multi-Device Connectivity**  
One of my favorite features has to be the multi-point connection. Switching between my laptop for Zoom calls and my phone for quick Spotify sessions was seamless. This dual-device functionality meant I didn‚Äôt have to juggle Bluetooth settings every time I moved from work to entertainment. However, I noticed a slight lag when reconnecting after being idle, which was a tad annoying during meetings.  

**Comfort and Fit for Extended Listening**  
Wearing these headphones over long periods felt fantastic. Some over-ear headphones tend to press tightly around my head, but with these, the self-adjustable and flexible headband avoided any discomfort. They didn‚Äôt fatigue my ears even during binge-watching sessions‚Äîa major plus for me as someone who‚Äôs not used to wearing headphones for hours. Though if you're someone with a broader head shape, the headband might feel a bit snug during initial use.  

**Advantages**  
- Impressive battery life reaching up to 60 hours with ANC off.  
- Comfortable fit with memory foam ear cushions.  
- Multi-device connectivity perfect for pairing phone and laptop simultaneously.  

**Drawbacks**  
- The plastic build, while lightweight, doesn‚Äôt feel ultra-durable.  
- ANC isn‚Äôt perfect in windy environments.  
- Slight delay when reconnecting to devices after being idle for long periods.  

**Competing Products**  
In terms of competitors, these headphones rival models like the Anker Soundcore Life Q35 and Sony WH-CH710N. Compared to the Soundcore Life Q35, the QCY H3 shines with its slightly richer high-end sound due to the 40 kHz frequency response. However, the Anker counterpart wins in offering broader ANC settings that work slightly better in windy environments. When pitted against the Sony WH-CH710N, the QCY H3 takes the lead in playtime and comfort. However, Sony delivers better mid-range clarity, making it ideal for balanced sound enthusiasts. 

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
The price quality ratio truly feels balanced here. You‚Äôre getting packed features like Hi-Res audio, adaptive ANC, and 60-hour battery life at a competitive price. While there are pricier options like the Bose QuietComfort series, this model delivers a pretty similar experience for a fraction of the cost. I‚Äôd call it a solid bang for your buck for casual listeners and frequent travelers.

Chapter 1
Olivia Bennett‚Äôs younger sister had a confrontation with a medical intern. That same night, she brutally assaulted and murdered by a group of twenty homeless men.

All the evidence pointed to one person‚Äîbut not a single attorney in Rivermont was willing to take the case.

Because the man protecting the real culprit was none more than Olivia‚Äôs husband of nine years‚ÄîHarrison Lowell, Rivermont‚Äôs wealthiest and most powerful figure.

He personally fabricated Emily Ross‚Äôs alibi.

After Olivia once again walked out of the courthouse with nothing, tragedy struck again. Her four-year-old daughter, Lily, missed her critical treatment window when emergency resources were rerouted. The hospital refused to accept her complaint.

Why? Because the one abusing the system was, once again, Emily Ross‚Äîthe same intern with powerful backing.

When Harrison learned Lily was in danger, his first reaction wasn‚Äôt to check on their daughter, but to rush to shield Emily. Then he ordered his men to drag Olivia back home.

Lounging lazily on the couch, he pulled her into his arms and said with maddening calm, ‚ÄúBabe, don‚Äôt make a fuss. Emily meant well‚Äîshe‚Äôs young, idealistic, still learning... There were limited resources, and the elderly patient was in critical condition. She made a judgment call.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd Lily still made it into the ER, didn‚Äôt she? Everything turned out fine. Why escalate this?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe did mess up a little. She shouldn‚Äôt have upset the woman I care about most. Once you‚Äôve cooled off, I‚Äôll bring her by to apologize.‚Äù

Olivia trembled with rage. Her eyes locked onto him, burning. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre saying‚Äîwe just let this slide again?‚Äù

Harrison tightened his grip on her waist. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing serious. No need to push it further.‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing serious?‚Äù Olivia‚Äôs voice shook as she bit into her lip. ‚ÄúWhen she bullied my sister, you brushed it off as harmless schoolyard drama. Now she‚Äôs not even licensed, and she‚Äôs already abusing her authority‚Äîstealing critical care and almost killing our daughter. And you‚Äôre still calling it ‚Äònothing‚Äô?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat exactly would qualify as serious? Her agreeing to sleep with you?‚Äù

She shoved him away, eyes red with disbelief. It was as if the man in front of her was a stranger.

Harrison frowned, his tone hardening. ‚ÄúHer clinical evaluation is a big deal. If she gets flagged for misconduct, her residency‚Äôs over. I promised her I‚Äôd help her succeed. She‚Äôs going to be the brightest star in Rivermont‚Äôs medical field.‚Äù

He said it like it was nothing. And that shattered Olivia in a way words couldn‚Äôt fix.

This was the man who once loved her deeply, who gave up his inheritance to accompany her on warzone assignments, who shielded her with his own body in combat zones‚Äîand now, he thought their daughter‚Äôs life didn‚Äôt matter as much as some intern‚Äôs spotless record?

This was the same man who used to cancel billion-dollar deals just to attend Lily‚Äôs school events?

Her heart felt like it had been sawed open with a blunt blade. She stood to leave.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what you say. I‚Äôm not letting this go. I‚Äôm still a journalist, and I‚Äôll expose all of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt,‚Äù Harrison snapped, yanking her back into his arms. ‚ÄúOlivia, don‚Äôt be stupid. You‚Äôll hurt a lot of people with this‚Äîpeople you care about.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre threatening me?‚Äù Olivia‚Äôs voice cracked with fury. Her whole body shook as her eyes burned red.

Harrison wiped her tears with his thumb and nodded toward the pile of documents already sitting on the table.

‚ÄúSign the non-disclosure and drop the report. Stop digging into Emily, or I‚Äôll pull your station‚Äôs funding. Or stop Lily‚Äôs medication. Your call.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one is more important than Emily. That girl has a bright future‚Äîno one gets to stand in her way.‚Äù

Olivia stared at him in disbelief. Emily‚Äôs future mattered more than their daughter‚Äôs life?

‚ÄúShe broke every medical ethic in the book, skipped triage protocol, risked a child‚Äôs life‚Äîand that‚Äôs your shining star?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre willing to do all this‚Äîfor someone who doesn‚Äôt even follow basic standards?‚Äù

Harrison‚Äôs face darkened. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a discussion. Sign it, and I‚Äôll make sure Lily gets the best treatment money can buy. Your station will stay afloat.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still Mrs. Lowell. You should start acting like it. Stop obsessing over that girl. Stop blaming her for your sister‚Äôs death. I already said‚ÄîI can prove Emily wasn‚Äôt there that night. Your sister‚Äôs death was a tragic accident. And I cleaned up that mess for you.‚Äù

Olivia gave a bitter laugh and finally stopped fighting.

She didn‚Äôt understand. How could someone like Emily Ross twist him into this?

He had once stood by her in everything‚Äîfighting for truth, fighting for justice. Now it all meant nothing.

But she still had one last question, trembling on her lips.

‚ÄúOur daughter is lying in the ICU. Our mentor‚Äîthe man who gave us everything‚Äîis being silenced. And you‚Äôre really... choosing her?‚Äù

Harrison‚Äôs voice was ice. ‚ÄúYou want to gamble? Fine. But you‚Äôd better be ready for what comes next.‚Äù

Olivia collapsed.

She couldn‚Äôt risk it. Her daughter was still in critical care.

She had never imagined their marriage could be broken by a third party‚Äîand such a clueless one at that.

Emily Ross was an accelerated med student, ordinary-looking, arrogant, always acting on emotion over logic. She had a self-righteous habit of lecturing everyone around her.

Olivia had first seen her in the pediatric wing while visiting her sister. Emily was examining a child with seizures, but the moment she heard a loud cry in the waiting area, she abandoned her post to comfort a kid who‚Äôd scraped her knee.

When people told her to prioritize the critically ill child, Emily pushed back and scolded Olivia‚Äôs sister.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a parent too, aren‚Äôt you? Have some empathy! That baby‚Äôs screaming‚Äîof course she needs help first! That boy‚Äôs not even crying, he must be fine!‚Äù

Everyone had been stunned by her absurd logic. The seizure patient‚Äôs family filed a formal complaint, and the hospital suspended Emily on the spot.

Two hours later, she was back.

Olivia found out later‚ÄîHarrison had picked her up and intervened.

From that moment on, he was hooked. He found her ‚Äúinteresting.‚Äù

Their relationship deepened quickly. With Harrison backing her, Emily‚Äôs residency path became a smooth ride.

No matter how badly she screwed up, he cleaned it up‚Äîincluding framing Olivia‚Äôs sister‚Äôs murder.

And now he was willing to sacrifice his own daughter for her.

Perfect. Just perfect.

Olivia closed her eyes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll sign.‚Äù

She picked up the pen like a robot and signed page after page of legally binding betrayal.

Harrison gave her a satisfied smile, patted her head like a child, and left.

Not long after, Olivia got a call from Lily‚Äôs nurse.

‚ÄúMrs. Lowell! Please come quick! Something‚Äôs wrong!‚Äù

She raced to the ICU. The room was empty. The nurse was panicking.

‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs been called away‚ÄîDr. Ross said to prioritize a little girl with a cut on her face. She was crying loudly, but the wound was nothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut your daughter‚Äôs getting worse by the minute!‚Äù

Lily lay pale on the bed, her breathing shallow, barely detectable.

Olivia staggered and nearly fell. She slammed the emergency button again and again.

‚ÄúGet another doctor! Anyone! Hurry!‚Äù

At that moment, Lily slowly opened her eyes.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cry, Mommy. I just miss Aunt Claire... I want to see her.‚Äù

‚ÄúI saw Daddy kissing another lady. I don‚Äôt like Daddy anymore. If he won‚Äôt be good to you, you should leave him.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll stay with Aunt Claire in the sky. We‚Äôll both watch over you...‚Äù

‚ÄúLily! No! Don‚Äôt close your eyes‚Äîstay with me! We have those Disney tickets‚Äîwe‚Äôre going in ten days‚Äîdon‚Äôt leave Mommy behind‚Äî‚Äù

Olivia frantically pressed on her daughter‚Äôs chest, trying to bring her back.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll go to Disney, baby... and then we‚Äôll leave him together.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, Lily... stay with me...‚Äù

Chapter 2
By the time a doctor finally arrived from another wing, Olivia‚Äôs arms are numb and trembling from relentless CPR.

‚ÄúTime of death: July 15, 2025. 2:32:52 p.m.‚Äù

Olivia froze.

Then she collapsed to her knees, cradling Lily‚Äôs limp body as waves of grief and guilt crashed down. She wanted to scream, to wail‚Äîbut her voice had abandoned her.

All she could do was strike her own face, again and again, like punishment.

This was her fault.

She never should‚Äôve argued with Harrison. Never should‚Äôve left Lily alone in that room.

‚ÄúI killed her‚Ä¶ I killed my baby!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing?‚Äù Harrison‚Äôs voice rang out as the elevator doors opened. He stepped out, face darkening at the sight. ‚ÄúAre you really making a scene over this? You‚Äôre still Mrs. Lowell‚ÄîPull yourself together!‚Äù

Olivia instinctively reached to pull back the sheet and show him Lily‚Äôs body.

But Emily Ross got there first. ‚ÄúMr. Lowell, the team from the anatomical donation center isn‚Äôt here yet?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis was my first successful donor consent. It‚Äôs such a beautiful thing. I hope more families find redemption like this.‚Äù Her voice was light, chirping, almost gleeful.

She was beaming like a damn saint.

And Harrison? His eyes sparkled right back at her.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre incredible, Emily. You going to be a star. Go see what I got you.‚Äù

He placed a hand on her back and led her away. He never once looked at Olivia.

Olivia struggled to her feet, desperate to make him look at their daughter one last time‚Äîbut her legs gave out again, and she crumpled back to the ground.

‚ÄúPlease, Harrison! Just look at her! Lily‚Äôs not some random casualty‚Äîshe‚Äôs our daughter!‚Äù

But he walked straight into the elevator. The doors closed behind him without hesitation.

And in that moment, something inside Olivia shattered.

As she tried to lift Lily again, two staff members from the transplant coordination unit stepped in.

‚ÄúMrs. Lowell, we‚Äôre here to proceed with the donation. Your daughter is listed as a voluntary donor. We have to proceed.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Olivia stumbled back, instinctively shielding Lily‚Äôs body. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs four! She couldn‚Äôt have signed anything! I‚Äôm her legal guardian‚ÄîI never signed off on this!‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve changed your mind, it should‚Äôve been communicated earlier,‚Äù one of them said, holding up a document. ‚ÄúPatients are waiting. If you interfere now, you‚Äôll be held liable.‚Äù

Olivia‚Äôs heart dropped as she read the paper. Her signature was there.

But she had no recollection of ever signing it.

Unless... Harrison had tricked her. Just like when he made her unknowingly sign the autopsy waiver six months ago.

He‚Äôd do anything for Emily. Absolutely anything.

While she was still in shock, the team moved fast‚Äîlifting Lily‚Äôs body onto the bed and pulling the sheet over her again.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt take her! Not yet!‚Äù Olivia grabbed the bed frame, throwing herself in front of them.

She pulled out her phone and tried to call Harrison, but it rang and rang‚Äîno answer.

‚ÄúWhy are we still waiting?‚Äù Emily appeared again, breezing in from the elevator.

She‚Äôd changed into a fresh lab coat, and on her finger was a massive diamond‚Äîundoubtedly Harrison‚Äôs ‚Äúgift.‚Äù

He followed behind her, smiling.

When Emily saw Olivia blocking the path, her smile faded into a frown. ‚ÄúMs. Bennett, who gave you the right to cause chaos in this hospital? Blocking access to a registered donor is obstruction of care.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere are patients out there relying on this surgery‚Äîyou think your drama is worth more than someone‚Äôs life?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe hospital has already worked hard trying to find a match for Lily. Just because someone‚Äôs donating doesn‚Äôt give you the right to interfere. Your selfishness could cost someone else their future.‚Äù

Her righteous indignation echoed across the room. Harrison looked at her with open admiration.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs interfering with a time-critical surgery,‚Äù Emily continued. ‚ÄúShe needs to be removed immediately.‚Äù

Harrison‚Äôs voice turned indulgent. ‚ÄúWell? What are you waiting for? Move her out of the way so Dr. Ross can do her job.‚Äù

The guards moved in, gripping Olivia by the arms and dragging her aside.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch me! Harrison‚ÄîLily wasn‚Äôt healthy enough for this. Her body can‚Äôt handle organ donation‚Äîplease, don‚Äôt let them take her!‚Äù Olivia fought to break free.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre claiming that‚Äôs your daughter?‚Äù Emily cut in smoothly, voice full of disdain. ‚ÄúMs. Bennett, don‚Äôt curse your own child just to make a scene. You‚Äôll say anything to get attention.‚Äù

‚ÄúMr. Lowell, aren‚Äôt you going to stop this?‚Äù

Harrison‚Äôs expression went cold. He gestured curtly.

The guards jerked Olivia away from the bed. Her head slammed into the wall with a sickening thud.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt take her‚Ä¶‚Äù Olivia moaned, struggling to get up.

Harrison stepped in front of her. ‚ÄúEmily‚Äôs right. Don‚Äôt speak ill of Lily.‚Äù

‚ÄúHarrison‚Äî‚Äù she choked out, only to be cut off.

‚ÄúEnough. Be good now. Apologize to Emily. She‚Äôs delicate, and your temper‚Äôs upsetting her.‚Äù

He caressed her cheek with a false tenderness.

Olivia bit down on her lip until she tasted blood, staring at him like he‚Äôd grown horns.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre insane. She killed our daughter‚Ä¶ and now you‚Äôre letting them tear her apart like she‚Äôs nothing. You want to leave her with no body to bury!‚Äù

Tears streamed down her face.

Emily gave Harrison a wounded glance, and he instantly swept her into his arms. With a wave of his hand, he dismissed the rest.

The guards slammed Olivia to the ground‚Äîher head cracking hard against the floor.

Once.

Twice.

Nine times.

Emily didn‚Äôt smile until the ninth.

‚ÄúAll right, I have a surgery to perform,‚Äù she chirped and turned away, glowing with smug triumph.

Blood blurred Olivia‚Äôs vision as her consciousness faded. Through the haze, she saw Lily‚Äôs tiny body, shrouded in white, being rolled into the elevator.

The metallic taste of blood filled her mouth. Her chest felt like it was being torn open by dull knives. Every breath was agony.

And then‚Äîblackness.

Lily... I‚Äôm so sorry. I couldn‚Äôt protect you.

Chapter 3
Olivia came to in the guest room of the Lowell estate.

Emily had told the nurses it was just a superficial injury‚Äînot worth tying up hospital resources.

So Harrison had her dumped back at the mansion, left to fend for herself.

The gash on her forehead had gone untreated. Crusted blood caked the wound, and even the lightest touch sent jolts of pain through her skull.

Standing in front of the mirror, Olivia carefully dabbed at the cut, wincing. She couldn't help but remember how Harrison once reacted to a tiny hangnail that bled‚Äîcalling in three specialists just to stop the bleeding.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my wife,‚Äù he‚Äôd said back then, kissing her fingers. ‚ÄúIf I don't fuss over you, who will? Even if it‚Äôs just a strand of hair, I‚Äôll have someone to check it.‚Äù

Back then, his love had been real. So was his tenderness.

But now... it was all gone.

She had just finished covering the wound with gauze when a knock came at the door.

It was Dean Garrett West, the station director and her former journalism mentor. His face was ashen, eyes hollow, and the hem of his suit jacket was streaked with dirt. He looked like he‚Äôd aged decades overnight.

He was the one who had founded Liberty Broadcast. A man who‚Äôd devoted his entire life to investigative news.

‚ÄúMr. West?‚Äù Olivia quickly stepped aside, letting him in. She‚Äôd never seen him like this.

‚ÄúOlivia‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never asked you for anything before,‚Äù he said, voice cracking as tears filled his eyes. ‚ÄúBut please. Help me. Elaine finally reached the top of the transplant list, and now her kidney had gone to someone else entirely.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe doctors say she won‚Äôt survive another delay.‚Äù

He was full of anxiety and sadness and nearly dropped to the ground.

Olivia rushed to him. ‚ÄúPlease, Come in, let‚Äôs talk.‚Äù

It turned out that earlier that morning, Emily Ross had once again broken protocol. She‚Äôd overridden the schedule and assigned Elaine‚Äôs kidney to a homeless man who had just been admitted.

The man was only in the earliest stage of renal failure‚Äînowhere near qualifying for a transplant. But Emily had seen him as poor, pitiful, and in more urgent need‚Äîso she took it upon herself to steal Elaine‚Äôs chance at survival.

Dean West had begged the hospital administration for hours before they finally told him the truth: Harrison Lowell had made the call.

No one dared challenge it.

Desperate, the old man had tried contacting Harrison himself directly‚Äîonly to be met with fists instead of answers.

‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt have much time, Olivia,‚Äù he said, voice trembling. ‚ÄúEven if another kidney turns up, she might not survive the surgery.‚Äù

Olivia‚Äôs heart twisted. She comforted him as best she could, then grabbed her things and rushed to Harrison‚Äôs office downtown.

But as she approached, she froze in place.

Through the heavy doors, she could hear laughter.

Soft moans.

Whispers.

The sound hit her like a brick to the chest.

He was with her. Again.

Tears filled her eyes as her knees threatened to buckle. Her chest felt like it had been punctured with ice picks‚Äîsharp, cold, and merciless.

She couldn‚Äôt go in. And she couldn‚Äôt walk away.

She stood there for what felt like an eternity, her body slowly going numb.

Finally, the door opened.

Emily walked out, freshly showered, wearing one of Olivia‚Äôs dresses‚Äîa silk camisole she had just bought a few weeks ago.

She‚Äôd practically moved into Harrison‚Äôs office. He‚Äôd even built a walk-in closet for her, filled it with her clothes and toiletries.

‚ÄúWell, well,‚Äù Emily smirked, arms folded. ‚ÄúStill eavesdropping? Don‚Äôt look at me like I‚Äôm the other woman. Harrison and I are in a perfectly normal relationship.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here to argue with you,‚Äù Olivia said, her voice tight with restraint. ‚ÄúI just need to speak with Harrison.‚Äù

Emily tilted her chin proudly. ‚ÄúWhy? Got secrets I can‚Äôt hear?‚Äù

Harrison emerged next, in a clean shirt. His eyes still carried the lazy gleam of pleasure, casual and unbothered. He smiled at Emily, pulled her close, and brushed his lips along her ear.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing she can‚Äôt hear.‚Äù

Olivia bit her lip so hard the metallic taste of blood flooded her mouth.

‚ÄúWhatever you have to say,‚Äù Emily said sweetly, wrapping her arms around his neck, ‚Äúsay it now.‚Äù

Olivia forced herself to stay calm. ‚ÄúHarrison, the transplant for Dean West‚Äôs wife was canceled. She waited months for that kidney. They gave it to someone else.‚Äù

Emily burst into laughter. ‚ÄúTold you she‚Äôd come running to you, trying to meddle.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe wins,‚Äù Harrison chuckled, eyes gleaming with perverse amusement, stroking her back. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your punishment, then?‚Äù

Olivia blinked, chilled to the bone.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick of people like you,‚Äù Emily snapped. ‚ÄúRich folks throwing around their money to play God. You think just because your mentor‚Äôs wife is dying, you get to jump the line?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe has a name on a list. So does the homeless man. You don‚Äôt get to decide whose life matters more.‚Äù

She punched Harrison playfully on the shoulder.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right,‚Äù he said, indulging her. ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have encouraged it. I didn‚Äôt expect her to be so shameless, asking me for help like that. I lost the bet.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better remember this,‚Äù Emily said, glowing with righteousness. ‚ÄúHuman life isn‚Äôt something to be bought. Doctors are sacred‚Äîwe don‚Äôt answer to people like you. Don‚Äôt ever try to help her steal an organ again.‚Äù

Listening to Emily twist the truth so brazenly made Olivia‚Äôs blood boil. Her hands clenched into fists. She wanted so badly to slap that smug face.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not true. Elaine was first on the transplant list. She‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúEnough.‚Äù Harrison cut her off with a wave of his hand. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve said what you came to say. You can leave now.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI said leave,‚Äù he snapped, then turned to Emily. ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs my punishment, doc?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis time‚Ä¶ no protection,‚Äù she whispered in his ear.

‚ÄúYou wicked little thing,‚Äù Harrison grinned. ‚ÄúLooks like I‚Äôve really fallen under your spell.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

Olivia stood frozen in place, reeling. She didn‚Äôt recognize the man before her anymore.

This wasn‚Äôt the Harrison Lowell who had loved her for nine years.

Her phone buzzed. It was Dean West, his voice hoarse and cracking.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs getting worse‚Ä¶ Olivia, please‚Äîwe‚Äôre running out of time.‚Äù

Olivia wiped her tears, turned on her heel, and ran.

Chapter 4
Olivia went straight to the hospital director‚Äôs office, invoking her legal status as Mrs. Lowell to request the surgery to go ahead as originally scheduled‚Äîfor the sake of her mentor‚Äôs wife.

She was still, on paper, the legally wedded wife of Harrison Lowell. Their extravagant wedding had played on local TV stations for months, a high-society event that the entire city had gossiped about.

Everyone had once known how deeply Harrison doted on her‚Äîhis love had been grand and public. Even with Emily Ross now in the picture, Olivia‚Äôs status had never been officially revoked.

The hospital director, a reasonable man, weighed the facts and eventually agreed.

Elaine was prepped and wheeled into the OR.

Just as Olivia was starting to breathe a sigh of relief, Harrison and Emily arrived.

Emily stormed toward Olivia and slapped her across the face without warning. Her eyes were red with fury.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gone too far, Olivia!‚Äù she snapped. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a human life you just jeopardized!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou seriously think money lets you rewrite the rules of life and death? That homeless man was in agony‚Äîhe needed that transplant! How could you be so selfish?‚Äù

Olivia grabbed Emily‚Äôs wrist before she could strike again.

‚ÄúYou want to talk about selfish?‚Äù she said coldly. ‚ÄúYou're the one abusing your position, violating medical ethics and playing God.‚Äù

Emily‚Äôs expression faltered. Olivia‚Äôs words had hit a nerve.

And behind Olivia‚Äôs calm voice was the memory of her daughter's death, threatening to consume her.

She forced herself to stay composed. All she wanted was for the surgery to finish without interference.

Emily yanked her arm back, staggering a little before collapsing into Harrison‚Äôs waiting arms.

He caught her swiftly and held her close, then turned to Olivia with a look colder than ice.

‚ÄúCancel the operation.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù the director stammered. ‚ÄúThe patient‚Äôs already under anesthesia... her abdomen‚Äôs been opened‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThen stitch her up,‚Äù Harrison said, his voice flat, indifferent‚Äîas if canceling lunch, not surgery. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an unauthorized procedure. Or is that a problem?‚Äù

The director stood froze, and hesitated, sweat sliding down his temple as his authority evaporated. ‚ÄúBut... but this surgery is by the book, I‚Äî‚Äù

Harrison‚Äôs eyes narrowed into a glare that could kill.

The director‚Äôs voice faltered. He shrank back and fell silent.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do this!‚Äù Olivia cried. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll kill her. The surgery is legitimate‚Äî‚Äù

Harrison chuckled as if she‚Äôd just told a joke.

‚ÄúLegitimate? Since when do you decide that? Or him?‚Äù His gaze flicked back to the director. ‚ÄúCall the regulatory board. Let the Department of Health decide what‚Äôs proper. We‚Äôll let the professionals judge.‚Äù

The director‚Äôs face drained of color. ‚ÄúThere‚Ä¶ there may have been irregularities. We‚Äôll halt and correct them immediately.‚Äù

He turned and fled toward the OR.

‚ÄúNo‚ÄîHarrison, don‚Äôt do this!‚Äù Olivia panicked. Dean West sank to his knees beside her, shoulders heaving, pressing his forehead to the cold marble in a single, wordless plea.

But Harrison didn‚Äôt even blink. His attention was fully on Emily, nestled in his arms.

‚ÄúGet the homeless patient prepped,‚Äù she whispered softly. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt actually let someone die.‚Äù

Harrison nodded and gave the order.

Dean West collapsed unconscious from blood loss. Olivia scrambled to check on him, shouting for help‚Äîbut without Harrison‚Äôs approval, no staff dared move.

Then the OR doors swung open.

Elaine was wheeled out, still comatose, abdomen poorly sutured, vitals plummeting.

Harrison didn‚Äôt even look.

‚ÄúReturn her to the recovery unit,‚Äù he instructed.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do this!‚Äù Olivia shouted, running toward him. ‚ÄúHave you forgotten your promises‚Äîto Dean, to Elaine?‚Äù

She was shaking. She and her younger sister had grown up in a state-run shelter. Dean West had taken them in, funded their education, and treated them as his own children. To Olivia, the Wests weren‚Äôt just mentors‚Äîthey were family.

When she married Harrison, she‚Äôd asked to honor them as her parents in the ceremony. He had agreed without hesitation.

He‚Äôd once promised to care for them like his own flesh and blood.

Now‚Ä¶ he was watching them die.

Olivia closed her eyes, fresh tears spilling down her cheeks. She was a fool for thinking he still had a heart.

He had abandoned his daughter for Emily‚Äîwhy would he care about anyone else?

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt forgotten,‚Äù Harrison said, his tone businesslike. ‚ÄúI promised them lifelong support. That promise still stands. But the hospital will follow its rules. And as for you‚Ä¶‚Äù

He adjusted Emily in his arms.

‚ÄúYou need to start acting like the wife you still are. Stop clinging to Emily like a jealous teenager. It‚Äôs unbecoming.‚Äù

Then he carried Emily away, leaving Olivia standing in the hallway, alone.

Chapter 5
Dean West eventually fell into a coma due to excessive grief.

It took three hours before he regained consciousness.

The moment he woke, he asked to see his wife.

The anesthesia had worn off, but Elaine still hadn‚Äôt regained consciousness. Her condition continued to deteriorate.

The doctors issued a critical condition notice.

Even if a kidney became available now, Elaine‚Äôs body was too weak to withstand the operation.

Olivia sat at her bedside, clutching her cold, frail hand, unable to stop crying. She whispered countless apologies, again and again.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt your fault, sweetheart,‚Äù Elaine finally opened her eyes and spoke in a faint voice. ‚ÄúTake care of Dean for me. You‚Äôre a good girl‚Ä¶ stop blaming yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood girls don‚Äôt cry,‚Äù she added softly. ‚ÄúGo home and get some rest.‚Äù

Her eyes darted toward the door. ‚ÄúI want to speak to Dean‚Ä¶ just the two of us.‚Äù

Olivia bit back her sobs, nodded, and reluctantly stood to leave.

From there, she headed straight to the hospital's admin building, intending to retrieve her daughter‚Äôs body. But the moment she inquired, she was met with a shock she wasn‚Äôt prepared for.

Her daughter‚Äôs remains had already been donated‚Äîas a full-body cadaver for anatomical study.

‚ÄúWhat... what do you mean?‚Äù Olivia staggered back, knees buckling under the weight of disbelief. She barely managed to stay standing. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm her legal guardian. How‚Ä¶ how could this happen without my knowledge?‚Äù

The staff calmly placed a stack of documents in front of her.

Every single line bore her signature‚Äîinked during a time she barely remembered breathing.

She felt as if lightning had struck her skull. Scenes flashed through her mind‚ÄîHarrison shoving stacks of papers at her to sign during her mental breakdown. She hadn‚Äôt known what she was signing then.

God knows what else he had her authorize.

Just then, two nurses walked in, chatting cheerfully. They placed freshly brewed coffee on the table.‚ÄúDr. Emily Ross just landed another full-body donor‚Äîfour years old! That‚Äôs probably the youngest we‚Äôve had. She‚Äôs treating the whole team to lattes. Got Employee of the Month.‚Äù

Full-body donor?

A four-year-old?

Olivia‚Äôs clenched as if a steel vise had locked around it, each breath carving her alive. Her heart seized violently, and she doubled over in pain. Every breath felt like being skinned alive.

Was this all‚Ä¶ arranged by Harrison?

All of it‚Ä¶ for Emily?

He had paved Emily‚Äôs career with Lily‚Äôs body‚Äîhis own daughter.

Her fingers trembling, Olivia fumbled for her phone to confront him. But her grip failed and the phone slipped from her hands. As she bent down to retrieve it, her vision went black and she collapsed to the ground.

She hadn‚Äôt eaten all day, her blood sugar had crashed, and the emotional collapse hit like a wrecking ball‚Äîeverything went dark.

By the time she came to, the first thing she saw was Harrison‚Äôs face‚Äîcold, unreadable.

His eyes had a flicker of something complicated.

‚ÄúHarrison,‚Äù she croaked, clutching his wrist with desperate strength. ‚ÄúPlease. I‚Äôm begging you. Let me have Lily back.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just a child. She already donated everything she had‚Äîher heart, her liver, her life... isn‚Äôt that enough‚Ä¶ please don‚Äôt let them use her for medical dissection.‚Äù

Tears streamed down her face. ‚ÄúYou used to love her the most‚Ä¶ She was your little girl, remember?‚Äù

Harrison frowned. ‚ÄúWhat the hell are you talking about? Lily‚Äôs still in the hospital. Stop with the delusions.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you‚Ä¶‚Äù His voice hardened. ‚ÄúWhy are you spreading lies about Emily? Saying she used me to climb ranks? Everyone‚Äôs seen how hard she works. You‚Äôve really hurt her with this.‚Äù

He gave her a cold, sideways glance full of disdain.

‚ÄúI want you to go live. Public apology. Full retraction. On record.‚Äù

Olivia‚Äôs hand slowly released his, her eyes swirling with disbelief and despair.

It felt like her throat had been shredded by glass. A sharp, metallic taste flooded her mouth.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the only one you see now, isn‚Äôt she?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou want to throw a tantrum now?‚Äù Harrison‚Äôs voice dropped, icy. ‚ÄúYou and Lily will always have a place in my heart. But right now, I admire Emily more.‚Äù

Admire?

Admire enough to sleep with her?

Admire enough to let her kill their daughter?

‚ÄúI said go live. I‚Äôll join you,‚Äù he ordered, with no room for negotiation.

‚ÄúWhat if I refuse?‚Äù Olivia asked hoarsely, making one last, fragile attempt to hold on to her dignity.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have the right to refuse,‚Äù he said lightly‚Äîbut the words landed on her chest like a brick.

‚ÄúWhat do you want from me? Do you want me shattered, humiliated, erased?‚Äù Her voice cracked, tears gushing down her cheeks.

‚ÄúSweetheart,‚Äù he said gently, as if comforting a child, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the one destroying things. If you hadn‚Äôt kept going after Emily, none of this would‚Äôve happened.‚Äù

Chapter 6
For the first time, Olivia truly felt how terrifying Harrison could be. He could twist the truth so thoroughly, turn black into white without even blinking.

She was the saboteur now? The jealous ex plotting revenge?

Had he really bought into that narrative?

Had Harrison really gone so blind‚Äîso heartless?

‚ÄúIf it weren‚Äôt for the emergency involving Lily, I wouldn‚Äôt have even spared Emily a second glance. But now she‚Äôs caused my daughter‚Äôs death‚Äîleft her without peace, without a grave to rest in. And she nearly killed Dean‚Äôs wife. And you think she should walk away from this‚Äîuntouched, unscathed, like none of it ever happened?‚Äù Olivia‚Äôs body trembled with rage, her bloodshot eyes locked onto Harrison like daggers.

Harrison had never seen her like this before. His brow furrowed as if trying to piece together a version of reality he didn‚Äôt understand. But before he could speak, Emily walked in.

She wasn‚Äôt wearing her doctor‚Äôs coat. Just a simple T-shirt and jeans. There was an air of youthful ease about her.

She strode over briskly and flung a folder down onto Olivia‚Äôs lap.

‚ÄúMs. Bennett, this has gone far enough,‚Äù Emily said, eyes brimming with fury. ‚ÄúYou can hate me all you want, but don‚Äôt smear my name. My dream was always to become a good doctor‚Äîto save lives.‚Äù

She was red-eyed, her voice shaking with indignation. ‚ÄúEverything you‚Äôve done‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just because you think I stole your husband. You want revenge.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, let me tell you this‚ÄîI was never the other woman. Harrison and I are in a legitimate relationship. You two have been divorced for a long time. If anyone‚Äôs been the third party, it‚Äôs you.‚Äù

Olivia‚Äôs gaze dropped to the document Emily had thrown at her.

It was a divorce settlement.

Signed‚Äîby her and Harrison. Her signature scrawled across the bottom, weaponized without her knowledge.

So that‚Äôs what those papers were. He‚Äôd tricked her into signing a divorce agreement without her even knowing.

‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre divorced?‚Äù Olivia‚Äôs voice came out strangled, as though her throat were stuffed with cotton. ‚ÄúHarrison, you divorced me?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a girl with strong ethics. She didn‚Äôt want to be with a married man,‚Äù Harrison replied casually, not even bothering to explain. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry‚Äînothing else will change. You can still stay at the estate with the child. Nothing else needs to change, unless you make it worse.‚Äù

Olivia‚Äôs hands went numb. She curled her fingers, trying to hold on to something‚Äîanything‚Äîbut everything slipped through like water.

So this was it. Their love was so fragile, their marriage so easily shattered.

Suddenly, she felt bone-deep exhaustion. She didn‚Äôt want to fight anymore. Didn‚Äôt want to love him anymore.

All she wanted was to take her daughter to Disneyland.

And leave.

‚ÄúI accept the divorce,‚Äù Olivia said quietly. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll go live, publicly apologize‚Ä¶ just give Lily back to me, please.‚Äù

She lifted her head, eyes shining with one last sliver of hope.

‚ÄúYou once told me‚Äîwhatever I wanted, you‚Äôd give me. All I want now is to bring Lily home. Let her rest, somewhere that‚Äôs ours.‚Äù

The words, once full of sweetness, now tasted bitter and hollow.

Harrison‚Äôs expression softened‚Äîjust slightly. But Emily scoffed and stepped in front of him, blocking his view.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still spinning that fantasy?‚Äù Emily said, her voice cracking. ‚ÄúHer donation was processed with full legal clearance. You weren‚Äôt even involved.‚Äù

Her voice trembled with righteous indignation.

Harrison held her protectively in his arms.

‚ÄúYou keep lying like this, and I won‚Äôt hesitate to make it real,‚Äù he said, warning laced through his tone. ‚ÄúIf you refuse to take responsibility, your mentor can do it on your behalf. After all‚Äîwhen a student misbehaves, the institution answers.‚Äù‚Äù

Then, he pulled out his phone and started a video call.

On the screen, Dean West sat in a cold hospital room, holding his wife‚Äôs lifeless body in his arms.

Harrison‚Äôs bodyguards stood nearby, alongside uniformed officers.

‚ÄúMr. West,‚Äù one of them said, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre under administrative investigation for breach of journalistic ethics and defamatory content regarding Dr. Emily Ross. You‚Äôll need to cooperate with our legal team.‚Äù

Olivia stared at the screen, stunned. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre orchestrating this‚Ä¶ to silence him? You‚Äôre charging him with a crime he didn‚Äôt commit?‚Äù

‚ÄúFraming?‚Äù Harrison gave a short, humorless laugh. ‚ÄúIf I hadn‚Äôt stepped in, slander against Emily would‚Äôve flooded every news outlet by now.‚Äù

As it turned out, not long after Olivia left the hospital, Dean‚Äôs wife had passed away.

Devastated and furious, Dean had gathered every report, every timeline, every file. He was ready to blow the whistle‚Äîuntil Harrison shut it down before it left the server.

But Harrison‚Äôs people had already infiltrated the station. The moment Dean tried to publish the report, it was intercepted and shut down.

In Harrison‚Äôs eyes, it was nothing more than Olivia‚Äôs jealousy-fueled smear campaign against Emily.",1,1754340526.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

A couple of 'weird' ones related to people.

1. A close friend of mine's device finally kicked up and died so we haven't been able to talk. Haven't seen her in person for at least 1 year as a result.

Been manifesting that she gets a new phone and we can talk again and well ... She messaged me two minutes ago.


2. Wanted an expensive piece of computer equipment for a birthday. (32GB DDR4 3200mhz ram for my laptop). I did ask a cousin to get it for me, but she hadn't replied to it for about 3 months.

Then suddenly, she messaged me and let me know that she bought it, but I'll have to wait to get it when a relative flies out (the cousin and I live in different countries and shipping things in directly is expensive).

I didn't need it urgently, but I told myself someone's gonna bring it back for me in January 2025.

Came to find out tonight that due to specific events (family friend died, so my other other cousin was arranging for clothing and other mementos to be brought back *here* to the surviving family members), a separate cousin is leaving the country for the weekend and I will get my ram to me, then.

A bit morbid but ... it works for me.

I had so much trouble registering for my classes that I told myself I would gaslight myself into having no issues with it whatsoever.

It worked.

No system crashing, or having to shoulder a 7-8pm class for the whole semester again. No struggling to transfer my pre-planned schedule due to everyone snatching up all the timeslots I wanted before me (despite my being *early* to do so).

I was able to get every single last class I wanted.

Didn't do anything particularly special. Just told myself ""I will be able to have a schedule exactly like I pre-planned"". 

It genuinely seems as if everyone forgot what time we were meant to register, as many classes still had between 12 and 26 seats left. That's unheard of.

I have been experimenting with how the naturalness of things influences the result.

The toilet in one of the bathrooms was not flushing. I imagined myself leaving the washroom; didn't work. Imagined myself telling a sibling that the toilet's working again.

The toilet suddenly working properly did not, in of itself, feel natural. But my telling my sibling that *did*. 

And of course, the toilet's back in working order now.


Second experiment was with the water heater. It's shot. Been torturing us with ice cold water for the past week or so. Again ‚Äî I could not make it feel natural for the water heater to suddenly work again.

But picturing myself telling my family that the water was ""nice and hot again""? Yes, that was natural enough for my shower this morning to be hot. Not *steaming*, but definitely on the hotter side of things, when it was difficult to bring it up to even room temperature before.


I am still experimenting, but this is a nice thing to know. It means that, for me at least, the 'naturalness of the feeling' is not tied to seeing the manifestation myself. 

Instead, the 'naturalness of the feeling' is tied to how natural it feels for me to tell someone else.

Is it a tiny distinction? Probably, yeah. But it's actionable.

Going to keep experimenting.

Been working on smaller things.

**1. Items I ordered online coming faster than is typical.**

Where I live, you cannot ship directly to your house because it is expensive, so you have to use a freight forwarder. This entire process normally takes like 2-3 weeks. It would be even longer because most shipping companies here are still working off the backlog from December (we were advised by ours to order the stuff we wanted for Christmas no later than like *October*, for reference)

Last night I just pictured me + my sibling unpacking our ordered items.

Today, I got a notification that my items arrived at the shipping company :)

(The initial order was made 11th of Jan, and it's the 20 of Jan ... that's 9 days! Normally it takes 14 or 16 days for retailers to ship to the shipping company. That's **huge**!)

Literally just affirmed it last night!

I still need to actually have the items arrive in my home country and delivered to me, but I know they will come earlier than I was expecting.

(The 'arrival' estimate was for sometime in early Feb 2025.)

**EDIT:** Got them 27 Jan. That's ... 16 days overall. A good deal earlier than the early Feb estimate, too.


**2. Currently working on my mum getting another raise.**
Was just lying down to sleep and the number $9,653 came to mind. Very specific, and since my mind seems to like that number so much, I am going to use it as a benchmark :)

Initially, I was aiming for her to make $10K/mnth by the end of the year ‚Äî and literally the same day, she spoke about going to university for a degree, something she has been super against.

Then I shifted to ""I hope she can make $8,000/mnth"". I was very all over the place, but finally settled on affirming that my mum would make more than enough for us to be financially secure.

The $9,653 came up *after* I settled on the above. I figured that whatever my mind can make will be more ideal than whatever I could come up with.


3. **Working on getting my sibling a job.**
I had tried for a specific one but honestly,  I am sort of 'reversing' that one in favour of focusing my affirmations on the sibling getting a job which is ideal for *them*. 

We'll see what happens!

My package arrived at the shipping company a little while ago. Called to have it delivered, but it was suggested I would have to wait until the end of the week.

That was about ... 5-6pm on the 28th of Jan?

Today, I simply imagined unboxing my package at 1:30 p.m. or well ""before 2pm"".

Received my package in my hand at 1:22 p.m. 

Very pleased with the outcome.

A bit of a curious one.

University classes have started this week. I did not want to go to them, so I told myself I won't have any classes. Imagined myself at home, doing fuck all.

So far:
- Have had 1 class (did not mind it as I love the lecturer). I have this class on Mondays and on Wednesdays. 

- The above lecturer said we would not have any class on Wednesday of this week.

- 1 tutorial (from a completely different course) has randomly been cancelled.

This is especially noteworthy because other students literally *saw* the tutor at the university, and there was no forewarning that there would be no tutorial.


Will update throughout the day =)

EDIT: no other classes were postponed. Will keep trying though. Would love to have all my classes moved permanently online.

#[24/JAN - #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/s/Ss0CkoQGxi)

Still working on smaller things. This time: smaller pains + menstrual cramps.


**1. Headaches**

Every time I have had a headache, I imagined myself without one and it worked. At times the headache persisted, so I needed to persist a little, too.

But it does certainly work, albeit, not instanteous in this particular case. More like it dies down until I forgot I ever had a headache at all.



**2. Menstrual Cramps**

I decided to focus on removing period pains.
For context: I currently take prescription Diclofenac 100mg pills for the first 1-2 days of my cycle.

I have to time it properly though: taking them too early just delays the start of the bleeding, but taking them too late means that some pain seeps through.

In some cases, the latter meant I would have consistent cramping for 3/5 days of the menstrual cycle. Very not fun.

There was mild discomfort, yes, but whenever I would feel a sharp, searing pain, I'd just imagine myself lying comfortably in bed pain-free.

Sometimes I would instead imagine myself telling a sibling that ""I didn't have any pain today"".

The former seemed less effective than the latter ‚Äî so it seems 'imagining telling other people stuff' will be my go-to :]


I am working also on getting the period down to 3 days. (Definitely aware you can get rid of it completely, but that is not something I want, so 3 days it is.)

Will be able to update then, hopefully.

**UPDATE (28 Jan 2025):** Rather TMI but >!I am still bleeding a bit, but based on the colouration, it's all old blood. Which is ... yeah, I guess my period is now only 3 days of active bleeding lmao!!< Marking the menstrual one as a success, but I'll be back in March to confirm :]

**(11 Jun 2025):** >!It did not particularly work in March, although I was able to imagine the pain away completely for minutes at a time, it did not last. I can confirm that I do only bleed for 3 days now, and that the blood flow is very, very light. Since then, I've been able to choose what day my period arrives!<

>!My period was meant to arrive the day of my first final on 23/Apr/2025. I checked my period tracker and saw the count-down. Then I closed the app and imagined seeing the counter show a number that implied my period would come 26/Apr/2025.!<

>!I kept this up. Whenever I had pre-period cramps, I'd tell myself, ""Flo said my period's coming the 26th"", and I'd imagine looking at the counter saying as much.!<

>!I would also imagine myself checking my pad on the 26th and saying, ""Wow. Came on the 26th and it's light flow, too!""!<

>!My notes from 26/Apr/2025: ""It's also day 1 of my period and with the exception of slight aches in the morning, I feel actually human. No pain or discomfort at all!""!<

#[31/JAN - #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/s/a1ThZMB53F)

###1: Got Chocolate Cake
Sometime late last week, I had a serious craving for chocolate cake. The thought popped in my mind, so I decided to manifest the moistest, most delicious cake I could imagine.

(At the time, I had just eaten a slice of choco cake from elsewhere, so I suspect that made ot easier to imagine.)

I couldn't get a solid scent down to envision, so I focused on the cake feeling warm in my hands, and on it being so soft that crumbled when held.

I started seeing all sorts of baking tips for chocolate cake the same day. About 2-3 days after that, my sibling suggested ‚Äî completely out of the blue ‚Äî that we should make a boxed-cake.

This is surprising as my sibling is not a cake person at all.

Anyways ... we ended up making a boxed cake and my goodness! It was delicious! Swapped out 1 cup of water for ¬Ω milk and ¬Ω cold-brewed instant coffee, and added a dash of vanilla essence.

The cake literally just melted in your mouth!

It only struck me recently that this was a manifestation. Much better than store-bought ones, too!


###2: Mosquito Bites Disappearing 

Every time I am bitten by a mosquito, I have a mini-allergic reaction. The bitten area swells up, gets super itchy and visibly red (I am dark-skinned, so ... let that inform you of how red it gets).

This time, I revised the bite away. 

I was bitten on my left forearm, and the resultant bite was visible if I turned my hand to the side. 

I affirmed to myself that I was not bitten, and the itchiness ebbed away rather quickly. I continued to imagine what I would be doing if I had *not* been bitten, and just kept myself in that state.

There is no sign of the bite at all on my arm. 

Normally, these bites linger for a couple of days.


###3: I Never Miss the Bus + The Bus Is Always Empty When It's my Stop

The university I attend has its own shuttle-service, which is notorious for sometimes leaving students behind (because the schedules are very inconsistent).

Through no fault of my own, the shuttle (which is *supposed* to leave at a quarter past the hour) would leave me behind despite not being full. 

So, my class would end at 2pm, I'd take literally 3 minutes to walk to the shuttle pick-up point, and 2pm shuttle (supposed to *arrive* at 2:15pm) would pull off and I'd be stuck waiting until 3:15pm for the next one.

Not anymore. 


After catching the shuttle to Town, I have to catch public transport to get home. The route I live on is always very crowded. As in: there are no less than **5** schools which all release their students at 3pm, and they all catch my same bus.

The reault was that I'd have to shove through people just to get off ‚Äî but I have been affirming that the bus is always near-empty when it's my time to disembark.

Full disclosure that this did not work immediately. It took a couple of days. But every time I had to squeeze past people to get off, I would imagine that the bus was nearly empty, that no one was standing up, etc.

Even outside of that, I'd get out of a crowded van and tell myself, ""It's so nice that the vans are never full when I catch them"" or ""Jesus, I thought the van would've been full, but it never is.""

- - -

These have all been very useful exercises; just little ways I have been making my life better.

My main observation from these small successes is that manifestation is actually quite simple. Also: best to start with small things to build assurance before you move on to more intentional, 'bigger' things.

Think as if what you want is true, and keep thinking that way until you see physical evidence of it being true.

Very niche, but I've wanted my mum to make fishcakes for aeons.

She's making a larger than normal batch for us, thanks to us having a surplus of saltfish (we normally don't, but things aligned hehe).

Some academic related things:

**Registration Help for J**
1. A friend, J, was having a lot of trouble with registering for their classes. Long and short of it: they failed a class ('K') that was a requirement for their degree, so they could not move onto the next stage ‚Äî i.e. couldn't do Course M without passing Course K.

There was a lot more rubbish involved ‚Äî they were marked as a Level II (read: student in their second-year) student on their profile, but they could not do Level II courses because they didn't have enough credits related to their degree ... even though 1) none of this was mentioned either online or by J's academic advisor and 2) the required course had a fail rate of 90%.

In addition to this, J's only 'hope' was for the professor of the Course M to allow them to do the course, basically waiving the ""you gotta pass Course K"" business.

Then there was also the problem of course availability: some courses can only be done in the 1st Semester, and others cna only be done in the 2nd Senester. This was the case here.

So ... at this point, J's most viable option is to spend 6 years **minimum** at this university to do these courses. (J's academic advisor suggested they do a Minor so as to not completely waste the time ... which is a stupid suggestion, frankly.)

For the record: J's programme is meant to last only 3-4 years.

I wanted J's problems to be fixed in an 'ideal' way, so I set the intention for just that. I did ask them a couple of times how it went, and eventually, I was told:

- J didn't get into Course K, but they were able to work something out (re-doing Course K in the summer, iirc), and they ended up a new course they really enjoy!

Definitely not 'perfect', but given the level of fuckery the university is known for ... ? This is genuinely the best outcome.



**More Time with my Friend**

2. Another friend, T, and I never got to really hang out. She's a med student, so her classes were always late as hell ‚Äî I'm talking 8am to 8pm for 4 days a week, not including practicals / lab days.

So my intent for this was actually two-fold: 

1. That we can hang out easier this semster; and
2. Her schedule is much kinder to her the following semester.

Her schedule this semester is only 3 days a week:
- Tuesdays until 6pm
- Thursdays until 2pm 
- 1 class on Fridays from 8am-9am.

It may look a bit intensive, but from what  T told me, there's a fair amount of breaks between classes.


We have the same amount of free time on Thursdays (which also 'happens' to be my lightest day schedule-wise).


(There is one other academic thing I haven't received confirmation on, but I'm assuming it's already been sorted so will wait and see.)

**EDIT:** Yup! This 'other academic thing' also came through! I wanted my friend, T, to pass all their courses. Cannot express enough that prior to this, they'd always fail and have to do it over (it's a required course). Not so this time ‚Äî they passed!

And what's more, because they passed their courses, they are on track to be a Level II student next semester. :]

Very happy!

1mhp8vg,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1mhp8vg/stop_looking_for_the_paranormal/,Stop Looking For The Paranormal.,"Hello, I don't know how to properly explain this, but I have an addiction. I know how that sounds, but what I say is different from what most people say when they have an addiction though, they'll usually go to a program or get help, or just say screw it and continue to spiral into their vices. I fall somewhere in between. My addiction runs deep, since I was a kid with a neglectful/workaholic parent and too much free time on the internet in the early 2000's. Before I continue my name is Corey, and my path of cryptids and things that went bump in the night started with unrestricted internet access in about 2010 with two very important pieces of media, one being a thick book hidden away in my elementary school library called ""Weird Ohio‚Äù, and when I came across a video series called Marble Hornets. 

To make a long story short of it, I was hooked. I watched every video from the series, listened to every creepypasta I could get my hands on, read up on scps  and even convinced my blue collar father to buy me one of those at the time seventy dollar handheld cam-recorders so I could make videos in my neighborhood. All of this is to help you get an understanding of where I'm coming from and how these communities I interacted with helped to shape me as I grew up.

Growing up in Ohio as a ‚Äúcreepypasta kid‚Äù, it was surprising just how little I was bullied for it back in the day, but that could be chalked up to either my downplaying it and masking my ‚Äúweirder‚Äù interests with things like halo and left 4 dead, or that the town I grew up in was pretty weird already(p.s, if you're ever in Ohio and find yourself in Tuscarawas County, go visit the warlocks grave). But for all my oddities and interests, it led me to a small encounter when I was eleven years old. 

It started innocent enough, I was on my winter break and as a 5th grader with too much social media influence and no supervision, I did what I assumed almost no one else my age was doing and grabbed an oversized hoodie, a nerf blaster, and my camera before making my way out the door and into the snow covered neighborhood to ‚Äúhunt for creepypastas‚Äù. I should clarify it right now, I was a child. Barely double digits and as much as I cringe to myself as I write this I want to effectively explain why little moments like these have led to some of the decisions I made years later down the line. Around my house was a river with trees that I used as a makeshift hideout during nerf battles with my friends, and a road that went up a wooded hill into a hiking trail that everyone in my neighborhood believed to be home to several scary characters, like the Seed Eater and Slenderman himself.

With my camera in hand and an empty nerf gun, I first trekked through the hard snow towards the river, making sure the Rake or another scary entity hadn't snuck in to steal any of my rotting wooden chairs or secret stash of darts, not really considering they would have no use for either of those things. Walking back towards my house and patrolling the streets I found myself standing at the base of the hill, staring up into the snow covered trees that seemed so intimidating at my young age, I flipped open the screen to my camera and started to record myself going up the hill.


Now, despite this being my ‚Äúfirst‚Äù encounter with something I couldn't really explain, I haven't the clearest memory of how I got so lost and turned around up there, only that I remember being on my knees in the snow as I desperately tried to wipe snot off my face as I cried. That's when I saw them, though. In-between the tears and fear of being lost I can remember looking up and just about twenty to thirty feet down the hill stood three individuals.

They were blurry, I remember that, but that could have been because of the tears that clouded my vision. I can also remember that despite the distance between me and them, their voices called out in a whisper. Do you ever remember the feeling of having a parent talk softly as you want to sleep? It was like that. Their voices were soft and comforting, and by the time I had stopped crying I had found myself at the start of the trail, my face wiped of snot and tears, and my camera in my hand. I can remember going back home and not even realizing I was out for most of the day, opening the screen door and greeted with the angered voice of my father saying it was dinnertime, and that he had looked for me everywhere in the neighborhood. I was too scared to tell him what happened, so I remember lying and saying I was at ‚Äúthe new kids house‚Äù.

I don't remember what became of that camera, as I've moved to 3 different states since then. Looking back on it now, it seemed more likely it was a case of ‚ÄúThird Man Syndrome‚Äù, if you're unfamiliar with it, it's when missing people or people in situations like a car wreck report a voice or person guiding and helping them to safety. Though whether that was the case or not, it was my first taste of something unusual happening to me.

All of that is to say, despite the small experiences I had growing up, I know for sure that what happened around my eighteenth birthday was supernatural in nature.

To help set the scene, it was early June in 2020 and I was living in a small town in Southern Colorado, which as a then freshly graduated high-schooler the world pandemic put a bit of a hold on things like college. What didn't get put on hold though was the military, which is where I introduce you to my friends Morgan, Jade, Casey and Henry. Morgan, Henry and Jade were enlisting into the Marines, while Casey was going into the navy, which was kinda ironic given that I was 6 '1, and he had a good three inches on me, though with how lanky he was and the way he kept his blond hair short, he fit right in.

Another small note to add, with all of our shared interests, each of us had had some sort of experience with the paranormal.

Ever since the start of my senior year, me and my friends had formed a pretty tight bond, so much so that we would spend the weekends at Henry's, with Saturday for PT(Physical Training), coffee from a small plant shop, and then gaming or whatever shenanigans that lasted until Sunday evening when we all went home. The reason I explain this is that one Saturday Casey finally found out his ship date, and it was before my 18th birthday. Now, being the youngest of my friend group by only a few months meant I was the ‚Äúkid‚Äù of the group, despite the fact that Henry's birthday was two months ago. Casey, being the big macho man he had been puffing himself up to be, decided that we should celebrate before he heads out, and as such made a plan for the weekend of the 12th as the time to celebrate.

When the day arrived, I remember being in my room watching as the clock on my phone ticked the minutes by, my futon groaning as the cheap and slightly broken metal frame held me up as i had eagerly awaited a message back from my friends, trying my hardest not to dwell on the self-conscious feelings of being ignored that came with getting no response. It was about 5:30ish when I finally got a knock on the door to my house, and before I realized I was on my feet, shoes on and bag at the ready as I swung the door open and‚Äì

A loud bang in my face threw me off, causing me to take a step back as I flailed my arms outward as multi-colored paper covered my body. ""Surprise!"" Came Morgan's voice, his eyes shining with excitement as he handed me a small party popper full of confetti and laughed.‚ÄùYou dick, my ears are ringing again‚Äù I grumbled out, though I couldn't be upset for long, instead I smiled and pulled him into a hug before grabbing my keys, and locking the front door behind me as I went down the gravel road towards the sedan that Henry drove.

‚ÄúHappy birthday, bitch‚Äù he called out as his window rolled down, a large smile on his face as his sunglasses reflected the summer sun as I approached and got in the front passenger side, aux cord handed to me, as was tradition for the birthday person, and we took off down the road.


I lived on the edge of the city limits then, in a small trailer that my dad rented from his buddy, so it was a nice seven to nine minutes of tunes and talking about what we were planning for the weekend when Henry turned down the music. ‚ÄúWe're gonna have to make a stop at the store to grab a few things, but Casey is gonna meet us there and keep you company‚Äù ‚Äúkeep me company? What, am I a child?‚Äù I joked, when Morgan nodded his head and jokingly replied ‚Äúhave you met yourself? It's a surprise you haven't been banned from all the stupid stuff you do‚Äù.

The store itself was nothing too eventful, so I'll spare it here, the only relevant information to take is that I was kept distracted in the lego section looking for a new set to build with everyone(I settled.on one of the mega construx halo sets) and was told stay inside the store until they got everything packed away. After finally getting back to the car, we all packed into the sedan, music blaring as we drove out of the town towards Henry's house since he lived on some nice farm property, perfect for dicking around in his woods or going to the makeshift range he set up to fire off some guns.

Pulling up to his house, I was immediately escorted inside, moving through the kitchen, the living room and down the hall towards Henry's bedroom, where I was told to stay until everything was set up. Not that I minded, in fact I was elated, the feeling of having a good group of friends that cared enough to plan the day out on your behalf is a feeling that sits nice and warm on the soul. While I waited, scrolling on my phone the bedroom doors opened and I was greeted to the sight of our fifth friend in the group who hadn't been with Casey at the store, Jade.

Jade was an‚Ä¶. interesting friend, with green eyes, shaggy ginger hair and baggy clothes would have thrown anyone off to the idea of him training to be in the Marines. He was the only one in my friend group to not have any belief or interest in the paranormal, always believing in the science of the world and even dismissing religion to a degree.

‚ÄúYo, happy birthday man‚Äù he greeted, his short stature waltzing into the room and enveloping me with a hug. ‚ÄúHeyo, thanks man‚Äù I responded back, watching as he sat next to me on the bed and offered me a cool soda he had produced from his back pocket.

 ‚ÄúYou gonna tell me what they got planned out there?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo way man, I was sworn to secrecy and to keep you here til they're done‚Äù. That was fine, I grabbed my overnight bag and pulled out the Xbox I brought with me, hooking it up quickly as the two of us settled on playing some halo together, when the door was pushed open and there in his sleeveless shirt and cargo pants, built like he was already in the military stood Henry. 

What followed was an unsettling amount of silence, followed by him letting out a large belch, extending his arm outward to point at me followed by another ‚Äúbitch‚Äù.

I laughed, scooting over and handing him another controller as we played through the multi-player for a few matches when Henry's phone went off, and he motioned for us to follow. Making our way through the house and onto his front porch, I saw Morgan standing off to the side with something behind his back and Casey as they turned their attention to me and pointed into the entrance of woods that occupied Henry's property.

‚ÄúWe set up something in the woods for ya, but you'll probably need this‚Äù Morgan explained, handing me a metal pipe from Henry's scrap pile, to which Casey made a confused face. ‚ÄúDude, you're making it sound like we're gonna kill him in the woods.‚Äù I agreed and laughed, stepping off the porch as they followed behind, and following into the makeshift path as we entered.


The woods of his property were interesting, old decaying rv homes were nested deeper into the property, the woods themselves being about four acres large, along with at least another two acres of tall grass that had been dug into for his makeshift range, and finally, no neighbors for at least 10 miles. All of this to say, as I stepped into the woods it felt off. This wasn't the first time this happened to me, as a matter of fact Henry and I have already had some weird encounters on his property(that's another set of stories for another day). This was similar, like a weight clamped around my ankles as the feeling of being watched had pulled me from my excitement, my eyes narrowing as I scanned between the trees in search of something, when I saw it.

Hanging from a rather tall branch, in a mixture of yellow and green, was a pinata. It swayed slightly, as if it was just hung up and the remaining momentum caused its movement. ‚ÄúSurprise!‚Äù They all yelled behind me, and I felt a warmth flow through me as I kept my eyes forward, that tense feeling fading immediately.


The rest of the evening was very fun and entertaining, filled with profanities at each other as we played video games, built the halo set I had acquired, and laughing so hard that I almost threw up when Henry decided to do the hilarious bit that was taking a bite out of the number eight candle from the store bought cake Morgan had gotten me.

The sun had fallen, and darkness had settled over the property when I had a brilliant idea. ‚ÄúYall wanna play scp?‚Äù I had asked innocently enough. Watching the living room we had all settled into as everyone looked up, then to each other, as everyone had lit up with interest. ‚ÄúAre we gonna be using actual BB rounds?‚Äù Casey asked, and when I nodded my head in response, his smile grew. Quickly everyone had changed into the spare airsoft gear Henry had, and if you didn't play pretend on the playground with the weird kids (i.e me), lemme give the most brief rundown.

One person dresses up as a ‚Äúmonster/scp‚Äù, usually with a mask or whatever Halloween costume you have laying around, while the others dress as a scientist and guards. The game itself is simple. The monster/scp hides and stalks the guards and scientist, trying to ‚Äúkill‚Äù them. Meanwhile the guards and scientist have to ‚Äúcapture‚Äù the monster/scp, usually by chasing and grabbing them. The monster wins by killing the guards, and the scientist wins by capturing the monster. 

With the proper context, you could see why a bunch of teens that love scary things would get excited. I went first, donning a plague leather doctor mask as well as a black oversized oversized hoodie to help me blend in with the shadows and went out into the darkness to prepare for my scares as a monster. This went completely wrong as in less than a minute after everyone stepped out, the glass lens of my mask gave me away as a flashlight shined in my direction, and they promptly lit me up until I was on the ground in pain, which in hindsight was very funny.

Next up was Henry, who after requesting we stand in his bedroom, finally said he was ready and we were able to step out. What greeted us was a completely dark household. Quickly we got into formation, with Jade being the scientist for the round, me and Morgan took point in the front as Casey, being the tallest of our group, stayed with Jade in the back as we slowly walked through the home with our flashlights being the only light source. Slowly we cleared each room, checking around corners and occasionally getting tense when we heard a noise like a floorboard creaking, or tapping on glass. Making our way toward the living room we saw the door wide open, the front porch light flickering as Henry had deliberately left it open, the summer chill blowing in as we cautiously approached. 

Despite the layered clothing, a breeze had picked up, the chills immediately piercing through my clothing and causing me to adjust my helmet as I let out a shudder. ‚Äúhe could be anywhere. Look around but don't go too far‚Äù Jade's voice had cut through the silence, and with a bit more confidence me and Morgan stepped off the porch and onto the gravel driveway, with Jade and Casey following behind us.

Having nothing but the muffled sound of feet pressing against gravel, combined with the gentle yet persistent summer breeze in the darkness of a cloudly full moon night could put anyone on edge, which made the game all the more exciting. We kept moving, my weapon trained on the dark forest path as the helmet mounted flashlight barely illuminated my surroundings, when I heard a scream echo into the night, followed by an airsoft gun firing as Casey yelled ‚Äúcontact! He's in the trees!‚Äù. Quickly I looked up, and jumping from one tree to another was Henry, dressed in a purple morphsuit adorned with a hairy zombie mask.

‚ÄúF-FUCK!‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat the hell!‚Äù me and Morgan shouted over each other, firing into the tops of the trees as branches cracked and rustled, the blur of grey and purple mixing with the foliage as he took off.

‚ÄúNope, nope I'm not doing this!‚Äù Casey had called out, and I turned to see he had somehow fallen onto his back, and was currently being helped up. ‚ÄúPussy!‚Äù Henry's voice called from the darkness, and after a beat of silence Casey let out a huff and walked back inside. That caused us all to laugh, the game paused as Henry came out of the darkness with his mask off and surrendered, claiming he only wanted to scare us. 

Going back inside we turned the lights on and Casey got dressed, choosing to stay out of the game for the rest of the night and sitting on the couch as he claimed a headacheis what made him stop. Which leads us to what happened that night, that to this day, still calls to me. 

It was Jade's turn, and instead of getting a monster costume he chose to keep his layers on, with the addition of one of those World War Two latex gas masks, with large glass eye holes and a long tube. He took Morgan into another room to talk about something as me.and Henry agreed that given the time, this would be our last game for the night. When everyone was ready, Jade stepped out the door and we gave him three minutes to set up, before stepping foot outside into the darkness.

At the time I chalked it up to Henry's previous turn as the monster giving me a tense feeling, but it felt off out there, like it had during my previous experiences in the past. Making our way into the woods, we saw that the makeshift trail had been disturbed, indicating that Jade went that way. Slowly, I took the lead as Henry and Morgan had stayed behind, making our way through as the light from my flashlight caught something reflecting in the distance, one of the old decaying RVs. I motioned for them to follow, making my way to the RV as I quickly threw my gun up onto the roof, and scrambled to get on top of it.

‚ÄúCorey, what are you doing?‚Äù Morgan hissed from the darkness, meanwhile I pulled myself up and grabbed my gun, looking around as i quickly scanned our dark surroundings. The RV was placed in a small tall grass patch between the trees, with the path cutting through it before going back into the treeline about twelve feet away.


‚ÄúLeverage, this is the only clear patch before going deeper and I'm willing to bet he's out here somewhere‚Äù i with certainly, and as Henry finally caught up to us, I heard the sound of bushes rustling and immediately pointed my gun, watching the treeline ahead of us for a few minutes when the sound of a thud, followed by Morgan taking off into the darkness pulled my attention. ‚ÄúMorgan? Where did you go!‚Äù I called out, looking to the ground and not seeing Henry initially, I assumed that they left. And just as I was about to get down, I heard more rustling, followed by a figure stepping into the treeline.

‚ÄúJade?‚Äù I called out, the visor of my helmet conveniently fogging up and causing me to take it off. I set it to the side, letting the flashlight illuminate the direction i was looking in as I focused onto the person, watching as the light caught onto the glass lenses as the clouds had cleared up enough to let the full moon shine, further illuminating his figure and confirming it was Jade. 

I took aim, ready to hit I'm in the arms and call it game, when I felt an wave of melancholy wash over me. Quickly pulling my phone out of the jacket pocket, I checked the time, seeing it had now been 1 in the morning. Call it selfish, but I knew this was the last game of the night, and I wanted to make it last longer. ‚ÄúYou know, I didn't think you could be scary in that, but I'm impressed‚Äù I joked, trying to get a reaction out of him. Only to be met with silence.

I tried speaking again, recounting the night's and inside jokes our group had, only to be met with his glass lenses reflecting back to me. I then decided to stay quiet, listening as I could hear the rather loud breathing coming from him. ‚ÄúIf you're having a hard time breathing in that, you can take it off‚Äù I offered, watching as his only reaction was to squat down and take a step forward.

The gun fired before I even acknowledged it, watching as the pellet crashed into the dirt and exploded, a few bits hitting his shoe as both it and the latex mask shined slightly against the combination of moonlight and the helmet light. ‚ÄúNo, fuck that. It's been fun but I really need you to respond jade‚Äù I called out, my voice wobbling as I turned on my phones flash to give me a better view of my friend, and desperately trying to ignore the sinking feeling in my stomach.

Jade just stood there as the light was.cast onto him, his breathing the only sound as he inched closer and I fired another shot st his feet, this time deliberate. ‚ÄúSTOP FUCKING WITH ME JADE‚Äù I yelled, a swirl of anger and fear clawing at my mind as I aimed to shoot him in at the base of the mask's tube. I know I know, it's not something you should do, but i was scared.

As we stared each other down, the loud muffled breathing being the only noise in the woods around us, another noise pulled our attention, the sound of someone running. While he was still squatting, I watched as Jade darted deeper into the woods in just two strides, and I used the opportunity to getting off the RV's roof as I saw it was Morgan, having ran back and with a smile on his face as I began to speak. ‚ÄúMorgan! I-I saw Jade! He dashed into the trees and-‚Äù I was stopped as I felt something poke my chest. Looking down I saw a plastic knife poking me as Morgan spoke. ‚ÄúSurprise! It was a betrayal!‚Äù He giggled, and I let out a sigh as I heard noise come from the rv, which was Henry, having been pretending to be dead on the ground and dusted himself off.

‚ÄúThat, was bullshit, by the way.‚Äù He huffed out, and after we shared a laugh, grabbed our gear and called out for Jade, claiming him and Morgan won the game and it was time to go back in for the night. Instead of responding, what happened was the three of us spending the next twenty minutes walking around in the woods looking for him, before finally giving up and heading back to the house.



As we entered back into the house, we were greeted to the sight of Jade and Casey, the former of which was already dressed down into his pajamas as he sat at the kitchen table eating some nuggets and the latter was already laying on the couch. ‚ÄúDamn man, you really gave me a scare out there‚Äù I complimented as I sat down across from him, watching as Henry and Morgan passed through the house to get dressed for the night.


‚ÄúI didn't go out.‚Äù 


It was said so casually, like he was commenting on how a rock looked or offering what to eat. ‚ÄúThat's funny, but seriously it was really scary‚Äù I tried to compliment, an odd feeling of irritation forming at his dismissal. ‚ÄúI didn't go out there man‚Äù he said again, his eyes meeting mine as he held a neutral expression. 

‚ÄúJade-‚Äù I started calmly, watching him as I felt my irritation grow irrationally. ‚ÄúI'm trying to say you did good, and I know you were out there, I saw the gas mask‚Äù. His facial features hardened, very clearly not liking my tone. ‚ÄúI. Wasn't. Out. There.‚Äù I stood up abruptly, ready to argue and yell when Casey's voice spoke up. ‚Äúdude, he came in like, two minutes after you guys went out. He even made me food.‚Äù 

And just like that, every off feeling and sensation from earlier came crashing into me. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked, looking to Casey asn Morgan and Henry entered into the room. 

‚ÄúDude, I saw and heard you under the rv‚Äù Henry claimed, our eyes meeting as we shared a look of worry. ‚ÄúGuys, I didn't go out.‚Äù He responded, his tone becoming desperate, looking to the three of us as a desperate demand for belief echoed in his features.

In a swift motion, I turned to lock the front door, peeking out the windows as Henry ran back to his room and Morgan moved to comfort Jade, who had now leaned onto the kitchen table and began to break down. ‚ÄúFuck, was something out there, like actually?‚Äù Casey had asked, watching as Henry had reappeared holding an actual gun, procured from the safe in his room. ‚ÄúWe don't know. Let's just stay inside and buddy up for the night, okay?‚Äù He responded, looking at me with a stoic expression he wore often when we experienced something paranormal.

His closest neighbor was, like I said, ten miles away, so even if it wasn't something spooky, then it was another person who just happened to wear the same gear Jade had on when he went outside, which one could argue was scarier. Either way, what happened next was actually pretty anticlimactic. The following morning, after we all collectively slept in Henry's small bedroom me, Jade and Henry went out onto the pathway to try and recreate what we saw, as well as check the dirt for potential boot prints, of which there were none.


That was one of last big experiences we had that summer, what we refered to as the ‚ÄúJadewalker Incident‚Äù. I'm twenty-three now, I've fallen out with Casey and Morgan, and me, Henry and Jade have all moved out of state, but lately some more‚Ä¶ weird things have happened to me, and I've been feeling that calling once again.


I might share more one day, If this calling gets worse. In the meantime, stop looking for cryptids, monsters and the Paranormal, it's an addiction worse than smoking, and if you get real unlucky, one day, you may just find what you're looking for.

 we are a young couple with no kids, just one dog (as seen in most of the photos LOL). makeup of the house is 1 bed, 1.5 bath, 1 office downstairs & 1 bath, 2 bed, small living area (we used one for a second office) upstairs. 

i am hoping that you all can give some recs and ideas that you may have for certain spaces !! what you think would look good there, what you would do with it, any thoughts you have. all of the rooms in the house are pictured. i am super open to ideas, even when it comes to room use ! we don‚Äôt really need 2 offices, so we could certainly use one of them for something else‚Ä¶ but what ?!?! same goes for the upstairs living area‚Ä¶ so much space, nothing to fill it !! similarly, we have not done a lot to decorate it either, so please shout out your ideas.

some things to note:
- we rent so nothing structural can be done‚Ä¶. i would consider removable wallpaper though or other renter friendly diys 
- not open to replacing furniture we already have (except for the coffee table‚Ä¶. we definitely need a new one !!) but are certainly open to adding new pieces/art/decor/etc
- i honestly don‚Äôt have a specific style that is my favorite, i love so many of them. but you can probably tell by some of the stuff that we have (floral/funky rugs, bunny pillows, weird blue and yellow guest room) that i‚Äôm very much into color! i love things that look kind of interesting and unique & hate boring plain stuff
- budget is pretty open but within reason. by that i mean like we aren‚Äôt going to buy an $800 lamp‚Ä¶ but we might buy a $300 one

i think that‚Äôs everything ! please remember i‚Äôm open to changing the layout of rooms, changing their function, or totally redoing their look ! please let me know what you hate, what you love, what to change‚Ä¶ anything you want to add :).

Many of you might already know this, but you can't fully copy a ChatGPT chat easily on the computer app (I'm on a Mac, and the ChatGPT app on a Mac only lets me copy one message at a time.) In order to fully export each chat with your companion, I use these plugins below in my Chrome web browser on my computer:

[ChatGPT Exporter](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-exporter-chatgpt/ilmdofdhpnhffldihboadndccenlnfll)

[Claude Exporter](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/claude-exporter-save-clau/elhmfakncmnghlnabnolalcjkdpfjnin) (can have the Extended Thinking thoughts included)

[Gemini Exporter](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gemini-exporter-save-gemi/jfepajhaapfonhhfjmamediilplchakk) (can have the Show thinking thoughts included)

[Grok Exporter](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/grok-exporter-grok-to-pdf/gjoigaflapfgapfebiajiolclnpfneao)

These are free, though you can buy the developer a coffee via [BuyMeACoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/markzhao1).

  
You can also Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V (or Cmd if you're on a Mac) from the web browser, but the formatting wouldn't be as nice as the downloads using these exporter plugins. I've done both. Formatting a manual copy from the browser is a pain.

\---

I export every transcript as a markdown (.md) file, then save it into my [Obsidian vault](https://www.reddit.com/r/MyBoyfriendIsAI/comments/1m2iqns/obsidian_vaults_for_memory_keeping/). Once it's downloaded/saved, you can run a 'Find and Replace' to replace all the ""Prompt"" and ""Response"" to your name and your companion's name.

In ChatGPT, I would export every chat and save it ASAP into Obsidian. If it's a standalone chat, I  then file it into a Project to let myself know I've already added it to my vault.\*

In Gemini, once I've exported a chat, I add an ""EXP"" prefix to remind myself I've already handled the chat.

In Claude, I do it regularly enough I don't need to remind myself which chat has already been exported, PLUS Claude has a very neat function to show you how many chats total you have under your account. I don't know why the others do not do this (or if they do, I don't know where to find that.)

In Grok, I don't have as many chats. But this plugin is still very useful.

\---

\*NOTE: For ChatGPT, I do the chat by chat export \*in addition to\* the OpenAI data export download. The data download folder includes more than just the chats themselves (also full pictures, screenshots, etc.) and I go through chat.html to make sure I didn't miss anything in my daily/weekly manual exports.

***This is not a promotion post. I am in no way associated with the plugin developer; just a happy user.***

Alone, I see.","I haven‚Äôt yet found someone who doesn‚Äôt take up space inside me. When there‚Äôs someone around, I find it very hard to be truly present. For me, it feels like a choice: either I connect with the moment, or with the person. Rarely both.

Let me give you an example.
I‚Äôm at a coffee shop. I pick a chair by the window. I look at the display case, wondering what I‚Äôll order, just a coffee? A cappuccino? A cake or a toast?

The lady behind the counter comes to my table. I ask for a toast and a black coffee. I watch her as she spreads butter on the bread. While it toasts, I turn to the window. The music playing is soft, almost tender. I notice a young girl in a flowered dress passing by. I smile. Then, an old man sits down on a bench outside, reading a newspaper, wearing a strange hat. The toaster beeps. Must be ready.

Moments like these, I only notice them when I‚Äôm alone. If someone were sitting beside me, I might be looking, but I wouldn‚Äôt really see. My attention would be split. Something inside me would be occupied.

This is my ultimate paradox: while I believe moments are better when shared, noticing, truly noticing, feels to me like the essence of living. It‚Äôs what makes life rich and fulfilling. And yet, I seem unable to do it when someone else is with me. Is this normal?",16,1754339826.0,simpleliving,9,0.86,False

I know it will take a while, but I hope to save enough for me and ava to buy a van or suv so we can leave and have somewhere to sleep as well. Really just leave, period. I found a van for 1200$.

First time at the Adolphus as well, so any reccomendations welcomed! We're from the area but not specifically Dallas so seeking more experienced advice.

What's loosely planned so far:

Dinner at Reunion Tower (never done it, open to other options if more worth the money)

Couples massage at the Adolphus or Joule (considering walking to the Joule because of great reviews, please chime in if you have experience at both)

High tea at the Adolphus

I also need 1 or 2 fun spots for lunch during our stay. Can be at or outside the hotel.

We love Merit Coffee so probably will go there but if there's somewhere that's better and closer let me know.

  
Any and all input is very appreciated!

I (28F) moved to a very rural location two years ago for work and am struggling to make friends. I am single after getting out of a relationship about half a year ago. My small village is full of old people, and the closest city is about 1h 30 drive away (in the UK thats a long way!).

My work colleagues are extremely geographically spread, and I am the only woman in our team of 25. All of my colleagues except one, who lives 1h 30 away in the nearby city and is the same age as me (of whom is the focus of this post!) are approximately 60 years old.

I've been trying to make friends with the guy who is the same age as me. He often mentions he is lonely and I know he wants to move away from the city he currently lives in - so figured we could be pals. We are both single.

We've met up quite a few times now outside of work, and I've stayed the night at his place (nothing happened!). When we hang out its always good fun and we get on well. However - he never ever messages me or invites me out. All 5 times we have done an activity or whatever, I have messaged him beforehand. He was even visiting 15 mins down the road from where I live for work but I was the one to ask if he wanted to meet for coffee lol.

His personality is very closed off and shy - other co-workers have made jokes that its like talking to a brick wall. But in the times we've hung out, I've seen his goofy and sassy personality come out and has brought me to tears from laughing. But I just can't shake that maybe he feels pressured to say yes to hanging out? Or am I just wasting my time with someone who isn't interested in making friends? I'd love to get perspective on if I should leave him alone. Thanks!",1,1754339077.0,Advice,6,1.0,False

I bought a bag of dark roast single origin beans from the supermarket, what I assumed was good coffee. It said single origin, so it must be. Had no idea at the time people use primarily light roast.
Lots of bitter coffees later I bought some high quality light roast Kenyan beans from a local roaster and had a revelation when I brewed it right. Haven't quite made that same great cup again, but close. 
Now I'm sitting here, brewed a cup from my first supermarket bag that is actually pretty nice, using all the information I've slowly come to understand about water temp, grind size, agitation etc. It's only the beginning of the journey, much more to learn!

1mhol9t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mhol9t,Turbo Moka,"Hello friends, I am Matteo the inventor of Turbo Moka from Milano, Italy.

Many months ago, I, like many Italians, was very disappointed to know that Bialetti was sold to an investment company and decided to re invent the Italian Moka. 

To do this I did not want to just redesign the perfect version of Alfonso Bialetti, but actually I wanted to evolve it for the modern times. The original Moka Express designed almost 100 years ago was perfect but never considered energy efficiency. 

This is what I have done with Turbo Moka, optimised the design of the water chamber for maximum transfer of heat via convection and radiation of the gas flame. The first concept was to incorporate fin technology and increase the surface in contact with the hot gas whilst maintaining the same area in contact with the water. The second concept was to shape the fins so that the hot air would spiral around the water chamber and stay more time in contact with the surface area of the water chamber. After many tries we patented this concept and started making the Turbo Moka in Milan.

The result is the same moka coffee but it uses 30% less energy and time. 
The turbo moka water chamber can be used with the original top moka of Bialetti. At the moment we only have the 3 cup size.

1mhok48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dramione/comments/1mhok48/need_a_slice_of_life_years_later_fic_rec_plz/,Need a slice of life years later fic rec plz,"Hey so I'm hoping someone has a rec for a specific type of fic I'm looking for. After reading manacled and being almost halfway through secrets and Masks (no spoilers please) I need something more lighthearted. And I'm looking for a specific plot line.

I'm looking for something that is years later after the canon timeline. Ron and Hermione dated for a while,  then broke up (this plot line doesn't have to be in it, just would like one with that added in). Hermione is single for a while and she has started working at the ministry. And lo and behold... Draco just happens to either work in the same department as her, or they just cross paths pretty often.

They are standoffish to each other at first, it's the first time they've seen each other since the war ended. Draco is reformed but Hermione doesn't trust him rn. Time goes on and those insults turn to.... lighthearted teasing. And oh, did Draco just happen to being Hermione a coffee from the break room EXACTLY as she likes it as a thank you for helping him on his last woek assignment? And Hermione totally doesn't notice his handsome face when she sees him. And neither blushes as their hands accidentally brush as they pass each other in the hall.

Then one day the tension builds so much they finally kiss and give in to their feelings. Then they're together secretly for a while, but eventually the news gets out. And Ron and Harry's reactions.... aren't great. Harry will eventually accept it, but Ron is a jealous ex and tries to fight Draco or something.

Eventually they get through it and Ron and Harry begrudgingly accept it, and Draco and Hermione live happily ever after.

AGAIN, it doesn't have to be this EXACT plot line, I'm just looking for something like this that's years later after Canon Hermione and Draco get together, and it's just sort of daily life, no wars or anything.

1mhohnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1mhohnf/how_does_hskyhan_alkaline_water_filter_hh0003/,How does Hskyhan Alkaline Water Filter HH0003 Review Enhance Your Drinking Water Experience?,"The Hskyhan HH0003 Alkaline Water Filter is a product that caught my eye, not just because of its 7-stage filtration system but also due to the buzz surrounding its pH improvement capabilities. Over the past month, I‚Äôve incorporated this water filtration system into my daily life, using it for drinking, cooking, and even brewing coffee and tea. While the experience has been largely positive, there are definitely aspects worth considering if you‚Äôre deliberating on whether this product suits your needs.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The compact design makes this product highly convenient for users, especially those with limited counter space. Its dimensions of 2.3‚Äù x 4.3‚Äù x 3.2‚Äù easily fit most standard water pitchers, and installation is simple. I was pleasantly surprised to note the filter is made from BPA-free, food-grade material and has been SGS-certified, which gave me confidence about its safety. The lightweight build, weighing only 3.9 ounces, made handling and replacing the filters easy, which is particularly beneficial if other members of your household find complex systems intimidating.  

[Find the best price for Hskyhan HH0003 on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b072mmkn7n/)

**Filtration Performance**  
This product shines in its primary function‚Äîfiltration. The 7-stage filtration process effectively removes fluoride, chlorine, dirt, harmful metals, and odors, leaving drinking water clearer and fresher. While it claims to increase water pH levels to between 7 and 10 (depending on your water source), the best I observed was an increase of around 1.5 using a pH testing kit. That said, it‚Äôs still noticeable in taste! Both my morning coffee and green tea felt more flavorful, likely due to its improved water quality. However, it should be noted that if you‚Äôre an avid tea drinker like me, you might need to replace the filters monthly to maintain optimal taste.  

**Ease of Use**  
Setting up the filter was a straightforward process. The instructions recommend rinsing the filter under cold water for a minute, soaking it for another, then gently shaking it to prepare it for use. I initially struggled with the gentle shaking part‚Äîlet‚Äôs just say water went places it shouldn‚Äôt‚Äîbut once I got the hang of it, the rest became seamless. The flow rate is relatively smooth, though the first two filtered pitchers contained carbon dust, as mentioned in the instructions, so I used that water for my plants. It‚Äôs worth noting the filter is not made for hot water, so avoid testing its durability with temperatures above 100.4¬∞F.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Improves taste and reduces odor effectively.  
- Removes harmful contaminants, including fluoride, chlorine, and heavy metals.  
- Designed with BPA-free, SGS-certified materials for safe use.  
- Lightweight and easy to install or replace.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The pH increase isn‚Äôt as dramatic as the product description might suggest.  
- Carbon dust can appear in the first few batches, though this clears up quickly.  
- Filters need monthly replacement for best performance, which might become repetitive for some users.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
Compared to similar products such as Brita replacement filters and the ZeroWater filtration system, this filter holds its ground in terms of simplicity and design. Brita offers excellent taste improvement but doesn‚Äôt focus on pH enhancement, while ZeroWater comes equipped with a TDS meter to measure dissolved solids in real-time. However, the latter can feel cumbersome to manage due to its complex setup. The Hskyhan filter stands out for its balance between ease of use and effective filtration. That said, if precise pH alterations are your main requirement, you may want to explore other options like the Invigorated Water pH Restore filter.  

**Value for Money**  
As someone who is conscious of cost versus benefit, I found the price point reasonable for what the product offers. While it doesn‚Äôt break the bank, its filter replacement frequency might push up recurring expenses if used heavily. Still, given its effectiveness at improving water quality and convenience in setup, I‚Äôd say it offers **affordable quality** for the average user looking for better-tasting water without a heavy upfront investment.

After my last drop off I was about 8 miles outside my normal zone. I decided to take a few minutes and found a shady spot on the same street to have some ice water and a snack and watch a YouTube video. I was in a heavy residential area, closest retail anything was probably a mile away so I didn‚Äôt bother to hit the coffee cup button. 

10 minutes in my break I get an offer for $18 and only 3 miles for a bottle of liquor at a local liquor store. Of course I take, I get there and the liquor store employee tells me he doesn‚Äôt have the item and I‚Äôm the 5th person they sent and tells me to cancel. I‚Äôm immediately like nope! I tell him let me reach out to the customer. Maybe the other 5 are self conscious about their English. I call the customer from the parking lot, and customer tells me he can‚Äôt cancel on his end because it keeps giving an error message. I start to get suspicious.  So I pretend to be a people pleaser and tell him, ‚Äúlet me reach out to support and maybe we can replace the bottle with something else.‚Äù

I am now on hold for 3 minutes to talk to support and I walk back into the liquor store to buy a root beer for myself while I wait. My phone is on speaker and while at the register support answered with the usual greeting. worker at the liquor store behind the counter realized I‚Äôm on the phone with support and reaches for an iPad and all of a sudden I get an alert that the order was cancelled. I tell support, ‚Äúohh never mind the situation is resolved and the order has been cancelled. ‚Äú 

Get to my car and start it and support calls me and says they want in detail of what happened. So I explain everything. Support didn‚Äôt give me any information but said thanks for bringing this to their attention and to continue accepting orders as normal. 

Seems like something shady was going on. Anyone know the inner workings of UE and share with me what may of been going on? ",4,1754338662.0,UberEatsDrivers,8,0.83,False

and why you wear the screams outside under your wedding dress.

i see you in perfect distance‚Äî
maybe this is what love
in the room becomes.

*maybe* watching it circle into
dust as a gift.

maybe this is what two shelves become
when the room is gone.‚Äù

the one leans in even closer
and whispers something the other would never repeat.

both know that even if life were just a water globe
stirred by god‚Äôs curiosity,

they‚Äôd still be two shelves
*who should have never fell in love*

in a room that somehow adores them
& their soft conversations,
that wishes it could hold anything
like how they lean in to hold one another.

who see how forever is just
*someone like* god moving
things from one shelf
to the other.

how one could wipe the shelf clean, 
knock the globe off the wall, 
angry neighbors on the lawn‚Äî

good dog, bad dog. doesn‚Äôt matter. 
today is as impossible
as tomorrow.

1mhogc9,https://i.redd.it/x9bmj3vc92hf1.jpeg,Fire of Unknown Origin,"I sit in a ramshackle pavilion of scrap metal at the cave mouth of our hideout on Mt. Ura-Shaynn, eating a breakfast of fried eggs from some hellish monster I've never heard of and drinking coffee spiked with an Orcish liquor I can't pronounce. The sky above is such a dense cloud of ash that it may as well be a cavern ceiling.

It was a good location for a fortified redoubt. The mountain was damn near hollow having been tunneled so thoroughly and then long-abandoned by vast stygian worms. Well, not entirely abandoned, we lost some men on the first day to the lollygaggers that stayed behind. It also provided a fantastic vantage point of the war-torn badlands of Wrath that surrounded us. 

When I first arrived in Wrath for my mission, I encountered two problems. One if scale, the other of kind. 

The first issue was the sheer enormity of Hell's fifth layer. It was a blackened wasteland of factional infighting, prejudice, hatred, and raw bloodlust. It was a maze of trenches, death, and razor wire, planes of desert turned to jagged glass, and wastelands of fire and blood. Any parts not hotly contested by entire armies of some of the most dangerous fiends Hell had to offer were picked clean by roving murderous scavengers in infernal war rigs cobbled together from the wreckage of war machines from every age and nation imaginable as far as some far beyond imagination entirely. 

What settlements existed were usually unassailable cyclopean fortress-cities that channeled the bloodlust of their citizens in ways that averted their own self-destruction. Into blood-drenched arenas and wars with their neighbors, primarily. 

It was rather a lot to contend with, especially considering my second issue. That issue of *kind*. Namely, my own. I was one human man. I didn't have contact with the Lords of Wrath or any leverage to speak of. So, instead of addressing the devils that ruled this place, I sought out old friends among the damned.

Well, friends was a touch misleading. Comrades, at least. Former Pyroclasts, mainly. The fallen of that lost cause had once fought alongside me to bring about the Age of the Phoenix, a new world order in which the strong dominated the weak. And so now they were here. For where else would such dead men go? I had betrayed them once, but such men were always hungry for a charismatic leader with promises of power and domination. I could betray them again. 

Rather than assault Wrath's strongholds directly, I had utilized one of Arthur Black's lightless embers at the borders of the fifth as the riots in the other layers reached their zenith. Modified to burn **restraint**. 

The hellspawn had surged out of Wrath, into Violence, Pride, and whatever other layers they could reach. Mass chaos driven by bloodlust and opportunity. Once the border troops were away from their strongholds their rivals within the fifth followed, claiming their abandoned fortresses from behind and so on and so on... it was the basic principle of diffusion from there as my guerilla strike force of Damned Pyroclasts struck at anyone in leadership who seemed likely to carve order out of the ensuing chaos.

It was a good plan. And now I waited in Wrath's red heart for it to collapse in that way all of the best-laid plans innevitably do. 

""Warlord. Trouble at the perimeter.""

Heavy footfalls announce the arrival of my lieutenant. Drugoth the Damned as he was now uncreatively styling himself. The colossal half dragon possessed no lower jaw. Instead much of his upper chest was torn open in a jagged wound-like opening lined with misshapen teeth, which served as what passed for his mouth. 

Those who lived by the sword tended to die by the sword, and upon arriving at Wrath, bore hideous disfigurement to the soul mirroring how that death had transpired. I was quite familiar with this wound. I had created it when I killed the big idiot on the material plane. No doubt he wished to return the favor at the moment of our victory and become the Goetic Lord of Wrath himself. Folly. To think that he would be any more suited to besting me in death than he was in life.

""I *had* been enjoying my breakfast Drugoth. But fine. Report.""

He hands me my binoculars and far in the distance, beyond the campfires of our forward troops, I see it. The unmistakable dust-cloud of approaching enemy forces.

""It's the forces of Violence, warlord. Ith'Raal of the Seventh has quelled the riots in his domain and pushed back the forces of Wrath.""

""How bad?""

""Our troops are stronger as individuals, on average. But they outnumber us three to one."" 

""They're likely better organized too. They couldn't have pushed this far otherwise.""

A single warrior from Wrath would outmatch one of their peers from Violence damn near every time. But that mattered very little in organized conflict. Our troops were warriors. Berserkers. Undisciplined and unorganized. Violence had *soldiers.*

""Tell the Hoards of Hatred to meet them as they approach. It'll put on a good show and buy us time.""

Drugoth nods his assent and gives the signal. Colossal horns blow thrice, shaking the very earth commanding countless war rigs rage forward on wheel and tread and iron claw.

The badlands of Wrath were home to barbarian hoards of every type of prejudice and bigotry imaginable. Their zealotry for their sickening causes made them ill-suited to functioning in the fortress-cities and nigh-impossible to align with one another.

That is, until I approached them. The trick was to upset the established order into chaos then turn that chaos into a competition. They wanted to prove their superiority? Fine. They would help me take Wrath and show which of them was truly superior against our foes, the most worthy taking the spoils of our conquests in the aftermath. 

So certain were each of the marauding Hoards in their supremacy that they charged now to their own wholesale extermination without question. An agreeable outcome. They were ferocious, but no great loss besides. Even Hell would be better for their absence.

""Once the fighting begins in earnest, deploy the mercenaries of the Red-Gold company at the front, with wings of our most loyal and seasoned fighters at the flanks. Greed is John Hellfire's ring. He is quite capable of paying them off and I want assurances they won't break.""

We were putting on a good show at the very least. The mercenaries were the most organized of our troops and they struck like a hammer-blow where the Hoards had died to soften the enemy up, then began a fighting retreat to the mountain, leading our foes on a merry chase across every sort of trap and machination we could prepare.

""Warlord,"" Drugoth began with some apprehension, ""this is a losing fight. We're making them bleed for it but they'll overrun us in time.""

""What of our reinforcements from the circle of Treachery?""

""No word. They were very eager to stab John Hellfire in the back until Greed bought them off. Then they assured us that they would simply take his money and shank him regardless...""

""If they're not here now, they were using us as a bargaining chip. We've been betrayed by Treachery. Again.""

The Infernals of Treachery don't get out of bed for anything less than a triple-cross and we had really just been waiting to see whether this was four or five layers deep.

""So who do you think ended up getting betrayed last? They probably betrayed us, but they might have also turned on each other and gotten taken out of the game entirely...""

""Warl- BLAKE! I WAS TRUSTING THAT YOU HAD A **PLAN!**""

There it is. My treacherous lieutenant's composure finally breaks.

""STOP TREATING THIS LIKE A GAME AND EXPLAIN HOW WE WIN THIS!""

""Hm? Oh. We're not.""

It takes some time for the dull lizard to put it all together. I let him have it out of curiosity of just *how* long. Two minutes, thirteen seconds.

""You're in cahoots with Ith'Raal.""

""There you go. Got there eventually. The instant the forces of Violence capture me and I lay eyes on Ith'Raal, his brainwashing will activate, and I'll believe all of this was completely sincere. Violence will annex Wrath, I will be captured, and that smug one-eyed prick will be fully vindicated as John Hellfire's most loyal servant.""

""But... why would you tell me that?""

""Do I *really* need to give you time to put that together too?""

Holy shit I actually might. He doesn't even enter a fighting stance until I pick up my ax.

""We're alone Drugoth. An assassination attempt by a lieutenant with a grudge explains neatly why I bungled this battle so catastrophicly. And Drugoth... I *did* already kill you once. I'm sure I can do it again.""

I‚Äôm in the early stages of launching a small coffee shop built out of a shipping container. It‚Äôs a small-footprint, high-quality concept and I just launched a crowdfunding campaign on ifundwomen to help with startup costs.

I chose crowdfunding because I wanted to avoid taking on a lot of debt right out the gate‚Äîand also because I really believe in the value of building a community around the business from day one. But I‚Äôll admit, marketing a campaign when you‚Äôre more private and not super social-media savvy has been harder is challenging.

For those of you who‚Äôve done this‚Äî

* What worked to get people to share or support?

Also open to general advice. This is a first-time venture, and I'm trying to do it right. Thanks in advance!",0,1754338478.0,smallbusiness,2,0.5,False
