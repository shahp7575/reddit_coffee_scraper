I (26F) want to make a move on this guy at the gym but I still can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs just being nice or if he‚Äôs actually interested ü•≤ apologies in advance for the novel:

So a few weeks ago I was using a machine and I saw this VERY attractive guy kind of watching me from a few feet away. When I was done my first set he walked right up to me and asked what muscle that exercise worked. I told him and he said thanks and that he was looking for exercises to do, then he left it at that and walked away. I saw him actually trying the machine a bit later. I thought the whole exchange was a bit surprising because this guy was pretty jacked so I didn‚Äôt know why he would need me for help.

A couple of days later he walked right up to me again and said he tried the exercise I was doing and it was really good, then he asked if I had any more tips. I gave him a couple of pointers and then he started asking me questions like where I was from, how long I‚Äôve been going to this gym, then he asked for my name and we introduced ourselves. 

Around a week later he walked in a bit after me and immediately came up to me and started a conversation. He asked what I was hitting today, if I had plans for the night and asked me what I do for work or if I was in school. We talked a bit and then he left. Later I ended up in a machine across from him and gave him a tip about an exercise. This conversation felt a bit more flirty because I told him he looks like he knows what he‚Äôs doing so I don‚Äôt think he needed the tip. He seemed very appreciative, and asked more questions, like if I go to the gym on the weekends, what my split was etc. Then he said he had to go and gave me a fist bump, that was that. 

A couple of things that make me hesitant:

- I never catch him staring at me at all, except for that first day. Sometimes he even sits facing away from me.

- This guy seems pretty out of my league, so I‚Äôm inclined to say he‚Äôs just being friendly and chatty, but I haven‚Äôt seen him say a word to anyone else at the gym, he very much keeps to himself.

Any thoughts would be appreciated, would it be weird to ask this guy if he wants to grab a coffee next time I see him? üò≠

I don't have many friends here, so I am very ready to meet up for coffee and have an in-person conversation.

It was very close and I thought I found her, but I will never give up on searching for my soulmate, so here goes again.

I'm seeking a true bashert forever relationship with a female who sincerely believes in the concept that only one man is made perfectly for one woman. 

I'm not cool, not rich, not a tough guy, however I have been told I'm extremely handsome, and look good for my age, but I'm just me. I don't find the typical shidduchim techniques to be all that accurate. I'm Ashkenaz, and feel a Sephardic woman might match me best, but I'm open to all backgrounds. I'm a caring, passionate, hard-nosed American Jew who treats women like they are G-d's gift to humanity, but who hasn't been on a date in years, I have however been studying the Soncino versions of the Torah, Talmud, and Midrash for as long as I can remember and I daven all the time, but I'm open to any level of observance. I'm 6'2 and enjoy exercising, weight lifting, and eating healthy. However, once I find the neshamah that is the yin to my yang, her appearance will make no difference to me as she will be the definition of woman kind in my eyes and any insecurities that she may have will be what I cherish the most as my goal in life will be to constantly uplifted her through dedication, loyalty, and affection. I feel that my strengths will be my soulmate's weaknesses and my weaknesses will be my soulmate's strengths. I am open to a woman who values family and would like to start one of my own. I will never give up on finding the Sarah to my Abraham. And since Sarah was 10 years younger than Abraham, I feel that someone around 36 will be a good fit. So, if a life-long relationship is what you are seeking, I am here looking forward to giving you all of my love, dedication, and loyality exclusively for a lifetime.

I'm open to living in Japan as I have my own place there, the US, or in Israel since I have dual citizenship. As long as you're Jewish in some way, that's all than I could ask for. And merging our last names together without a hyphen will be our way of telling the world our souls have become one.

If you're able to speak Hebrew fluently or at least at a high school level that is one of the strengths that I lack. So if you find me interesting, private message me, explain your perfect man, and if you describe me, you may have just found your bashert. Thank you!",1,1750207994.0,r4rjewish,0,1.0,False

Life's been a bitch to me and I have MND (or ALS wherever you are) so making my coffee is now a too hard for me to do on my own. I have support workers coming into help however trying to explain how to pull a shot and froth milk to someone who hasn't done it before is an interesting experience...

I'm looking to get an automatic machine that I can perhaps operate on my own easily without too much fiddling or that I can just get someone to connect the milk container and push a button for me. 

I've had the DeLonghi elletta titanium at the top of my list because of the touchscreen along with the milk container just clipping on without any fiddly hoses.

Just wondering if there are any other suggestions people may have for a machine that will be suitable and easily cleaned? Budget isn't a massive concern but probably looking at a mid range machine.

We definitely want to have somewhere with weather compared to how we are living now, we visited Colorado driving through Breckenridge and then stayed near manitou springs. We liked it a lot but some parts felt a little too suburbia. We aren‚Äôt ‚Äúcity people‚Äù but we both met in a suburban town of Roseville California and didn‚Äôt prefer it.

We also both like hills and mountains (AND TREES)  as living in essentially grass valley before was also not for us. Colorado is partially flat from what we saw but has a good decent bit of mountains. We are visiting Spokane in October but we have to move mo matter what by Jan 3rd.

I‚Äôm a 32 year old Ashkenazi Jew, living in London, ON. I'm open to someone from the GTA, Niagara, Windsor, or anywhere in between.

Open to any Jewish woman who shares similar values and goals, and located in southern or southwestern Ontario. For the right woman I'm happy to consider other locations.

I‚Äôm looking for a serious, monogamous relationship leading to marriage and kids.

**About me:**  

I‚Äôm secular, agnostic, and culturally Jewish. I enjoy our traditions and celebrate our holidays, which I usually do with my modern Orthodox relatives (they're chozrim betshuva).

I‚Äôm 171cm, slim, in decent shape, and gradually improving my fitness - focused on health, not aesthetics. I'm caring, loving, honest, and very loyal. I have also been learning how to cook. 

I work full-time as a Product Development Specialist (fancy Software Developer). I'm blessed with technical skills, both on a computer and DIY.

Dual citizen (ISR+CAD). Lived in Israel, then Australia, and in ON since 2016. Left Israel after the service. Pro-Israeli. I speak Hebrew, English, Hebrish, and Englew.

I enjoy photography, programming, board games, hiking (especially with a partner), travel, family time, and humor - especially dad jokes and puns (and I make a lot of them, you‚Äôve been warned!).

Recently, I‚Äôve been reading mostly non-fiction: psychology, history, philosophy, and similar topics. That being said, I read Harry Potter more times than I can count.

A few more fun facts: 

I don't drink coffee and alcohol, but I was a barrista and a bartender. Yes, it will be my pleasure to make you a cup of coffee. Yes, every day, but only if it'll make you happy (even if only for a moment). I'll also be happy to cook for us. But I despise folding laundry.

**What I‚Äôm looking for:**  
- A Jewish woman who‚Äôs emotionally mature, self-aware, and serious about building a healthy and loving family  
- It is important to me that you'll be maternal; I am looking for someone who wants to be a loving and present mother for her kids.  
- Age: ideally 30 to 32, but 25+ is fine if you're in the right place in life.
- Someone who doesn‚Äôt have kids yet but wants them   
- Looking to get married and starting a family within the next few years  
- Good sense of humour who won't find my jokes too dadly
- Monogamous, honest, and an excellent communicator  
- Employed, career-driven - I'm not looking for a doormat, I'm looking for my future wife (strong,  independent, and intelligent women don't frighten me. I actually find it attractive)
- Any Jewish ethnicity (including a convert) is fine   
- I'm ok with you going to shul, but I won't join you   
- I do not keep kosher, but I'm willing to give up pork if it bothers you    
- Must be Zionist.
- Any height, any reasonable weight (more important - be healthy)
- Bonus: Kinky, sex-positive, huge foodie, loves to cook even if you're not good at it (I'm learning to cook too, no shame in learning!)    

**Non-negotiables:**  
- No games. I value direct, clear, and honest communication. You‚Äôll get the same from me - guaranteed.  
- Mental health matters. It‚Äôs ok to not be ok, and it‚Äôs ok to not be perfect (who is?), but if you don‚Äôt take care of your mental health, we won‚Äôt be a match. I recently completed my own therapy journey and I‚Äôm proud of the work I‚Äôve done. I‚Äôm looking for someone who‚Äôs done the same or is actively doing it.

dental routine when you work nights is a JOKE. like when tf are you supposed to brush when ""morning"" is 6pm and ""dinner"" is 3am?? add in the constant coffee/energy drinks just to stay alive and yeah... my teeth were NOT having it

was literally throwing money away on:

* sensitivity toothpaste (all of them. literally all of them.)
* that prescription fluoride stuff that tastes like battery acid
* fancy ass electric toothbrush
* some $$ mouthwash that made everything taste weird for hours
* whatever tf my desperate google searches told me to buy at 4am

edit: forgot to mention my dentist's solution was ""just brush after meals!"" like ma'am i eat breakfast at midnight, that's not happening

found this gum (ngl from a tiktok lmao) that's supposed to help rebuild enamel. figured worth a shot since i can use it whenever without needing a sink/bathroom/my life together

been using it \~3 months now. ngl the first few weeks i thought it was bs but:

* can actually drink ice cold bang without dying
* teeth don't feel like chalk anymore
* saved probably $50/month on all the other crap i was buying
* my work bag isn't a mobile dental office anymore

1le3tos,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1le3tos/f4m_roleplay_plots/,[F4M] Roleplay Plots~!,"
Hello all! I am looking for a roleplay partner, and before I get to the plot ideas, please read through some of my rules to see if you'll be a fit for them!

* Must be experienced and literate, and be able to write more than just 2-3 sentences and at most multiple paragraphs (2-3)
* Looking to play as 24+ age, it's just a preference for me to be roleplaying with people closer to my age
* Willing to set up the plot further and actually talk about it to make it both a plot we would like
* Mostly just not leave for days on end with no notice of why, I get it, we all have lives and things happen, just a small heads up would be nice. I will do the same if I were to leave for a few days or have delayed replies

Now onto the plots! These can be worked around and tweaked as we would want; these are just rough descriptions and such

1. ***Royal Rumble***\- Two Kingdoms that have been enemies for decades finally decide to bury the hatchet and become friends with one another. The Kings and/or Queens are formal and become close friends, but the Prince and Princess do not. Being raised on the hatred their families had for one another, the two seem not to be over it. They are constantly at each other's throats, making fools of one another by embarrassing them at balls and gatherings, blaming the other for their own wrongdoings, or just plain verbally attacking one another. Will the two ever get along, or will they still keep the long-dead family feud alive?
2. ***The Knight and the Alchemist***\- Years of training as a knight have finally paid off, and you have officially been given the rank of Knight, which means you will soon be sent outside the castle walls on quests for your Kingdom. After your first few missions of simple vanquishing monsters and enemies that threatened the people, the King had called to you for a special mission, one of his generals has gone missing and was last heard weeks ago as he was tasked to conquer a rebels base, but no word has come back on the Generals werabouts, so you are tasked to go and find the General but you were to be aided by an Alchemist, to help heal you and aid you in your long and trecherous journey. It was always a drag being paired with others, but it was the King's orders, and you dared not disobey. So the two of you set off on your quest, and you hope this Alchemist won't drag you down.
3. ***Lattes and Love-***¬†Working day in and day out has become restless, and a pick-me-up is always needed to get through the day, but not just anything. Coffee is the main addiction and aid for long days and late-night work. At first, the small coffee shop was just an easy place to grab a quick cup or two, but after a while, you started to go for more than just the coffee. The cashier girl who worked there from open to close was always the best part, aside from the caffeine. In the first few months, you barely noticed her and only thought about how much she worked there to see her nearly every day at the same time. But the few days you went and she wasn't there, oddly, you made you miss her; it didn't feel the same without her there. Eventually, you started to spend as much time as you could there just to see her and maybe make the occasional small talk with her, but every time you had a minute alone with her, people rushed in, but today was the day you were gonna ask her out! Would she reject you, be embarrassed and weirded out, or not know who you are? Oh god it's your turn to order, quick, ask her out!
4. ***Old and New Hollywood-***¬†Years of being Hollywood's number one bachelor and actor have kept you at the top, and your standards have only risen as well. But in your newest film, you decided to branch out a bit and be in your first musical, singing was never your forte, but you don't wanna be a one-trick pony. But with this you were expecting another top of the line Hollywood star but instead, you are forced to work with the new girl in Hollywood, this was not to your liking, and you were not to be forced to work with her if she was to make this movie a disaster and tarnish your name. You tried to get out of this film or use your connections to get you a different co-star, but the studio wanted her and her alone to play the part. You found out she was a theater girl with little to no actor training; she was just a singing and dancing theater girl from Broadway who was picked to star in this role and finally take her first steps into Hollywood. Will you choose to make peace with the new girl on the Hollywood block, keep things only peaceful for the press and public, or will every day on set be hell on earth dealing with the untrained actor?
5. ***Fandom RPs-***¬†This is just a list of fandoms that I can RP, and with these, I will play as my OC, you can play as an OC or a Canon character. Black Butler, MHA, Kakegiri, Delicious and Dungeon, ATLA, Soul Eater, AoT, One Piece, Naruto, Demon Slayer, JJK, Tokyo Ghoul, Beastars, Chainsaw Man, Fire Force, DandaDan, and Pok√©mon

If any of these RPs interest you, please shoot me a message with the word ""shocking"" in it so I know you read this post and such. Now these RPs can be romantic or not romantic, which is perfectly fine with me, and if you want, we can RP on Discord as well.

So shoot me a message if you are interested, have a nice morning/day/afternoon/evening/night, to everyone\~!",1,1750207438.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False
1le3tgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1le3tgl/situationship_is_back_but_its_different_this_time/,situationship is back but it‚Äôs different this time around,"Bear with me, this will be a long one.

Back in 2022 I was in a toxic relationship, two years in I started working at this resort and had worked with a guy two years older than me. At the time I was 21 so semi immature and not knowing what I wanted. 
Our birthdays were five days apart (both Sagittarius, if that matters lol) so i had invited him to get a drink together to celebrate our birthdays. He knew, and I knew, I had a boyfriend at the time, but when we got drinks, we both realized there was so much chemistry. Although I did come in looking to be friends (since this was our first time hanging out outside of work) I ended up cheating on my man at the time (not good or proudest moment). This created such a huge mess in all three of our lives. At the time, I was extremely unhealed and there were so many factors that it became a lot for this dude, so he ended up blocking me.

then in 2024 my ex at the time gave me an ultimatum to move out to Canada. i said yes and reached back out to say bye to him. he cried (first time ever seeing him show emotions like that) when we had to say our goodbyes. that was that and it was the end to the situationship if you will. However I could not simply forget about him. he would literally come in and out of my head even though we were now in different countries. I grieved this man for over a year that I ended up leaving and ending the relationship with the guy I moved to Canada for since i had feelings else where. At the time i stopped drinking which made me realized i wasn‚Äôt happy. I recently started going to therapy again and been living a single life because i knew i had to heal in order to be happy again. moved back home the beginning of this year. 

fast forward this past weekend i reconnected with resort guy after 1 1/2 years of not seeing each other. he had invited me to stay at the resort where we first met each other since he rented a room for 2 days to do a staycation. Call me a hopeless romantic, but when i pulled up and he walked outside and saw him again after all that time, I felt whole, heart-warm again. I knew he missed me, and I knew I missed him. There was so much eye contact and smiles nothing was awkward even though so much time had passed. It was just like old times. we ended up swimming, taking a bath together, hooking up and watching a movie while cuddling. 

that night we did talk, and I had mentioned we should stay friends for six months and do things right this time around by taking things slow and getting to knew each other first. he agreed and had promised to keep both of us accountable by making sure we didn‚Äôt hook up these next 6 months. I was so scared that this was going to push him away, but instead, he invited me over for his second last night. i ended up coming over, and we did more talking. He mentioned how he wanted to see me outside of the hotel setting‚Äîlike coffee and lunch settings. although I was horny and wanted to hook up he literally upheld his promise he made me. he even corrected what finger i was making the promise since I didn‚Äôt know you had to do it on a certain hand haha. the whole night we just laughed and ended up watching TV. When I was falling asleep, he gave me forehead kiss, cuddled and we both simply went to bed. we talked in the morning but had to say our byes since we had to check out. I did tell him to text me first whenever he wanted to hang out, and he said yes. we hugged and said we‚Äôd see each other soon. 

i have been in such a good mood and it‚Äôs scaring me a bit. like i said last time around things got SO messy and now i am scared to get hurt again, because although we never dated, it shattered my heart when we stopped. i know I need to continue healing and take this time while being friends to not be clingy, work on myself, and just simply be happy. i don‚Äôt want to be clingy and over message like i would in the past. i know I just need to keep doing me. any tips to not fuck this up? or like if he even likes me?

Now for the good stuff. I play on xbox and PlayStation. I enjoy singleplayer games but I do enjoy goofing off with friends in co-op games like helldivers. I'm always down to game but I will not play fortnite or CoD. Nothing is really catching my attention now. 

More good stuff. I love food and cooking. I'm what the kids call a fatass. I don't think I have a favorite thing to make but as for eating I do enjoy a nice bacon cheeseburger. I do make a mean bowl of fruity pebbles. And I have a tendency to make waffles with ice coffee. 

I love music. Rock and metal. When I wanna get wild I whip out the Macarena or Barbie girl. 

I wish I had the ability to focus on reading. I miss it but I blame phones for making my ability to concentrate not exist. But I do have books I want to read. 

I'm down for swapping selfies and moving onto other platforms if things are cool.

1le3q8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatholicMatters/comments/1le3q8r/hey_siri_can_you_save_my_soul/,Hey Siri: Can You Save My Soul?,"I once asked Siri where the nearest confessional was.

She gave me the address of a seafood restaurant.

Close‚Ä¶ I guess?

We‚Äôve officially entered the age where algorithms finish our sentences, pick our playlists, and sometimes know we‚Äôre hungry before we do. Artificial intelligence is no longer science fiction‚Äîit‚Äôs Siri, Alexa, ChatGPT, and maybe that unsettling moment when your phone suggests a product you *just* whispered about.

And it‚Äôs tempting to love the convenience. Machines don‚Äôt forget your birthday. They don‚Äôt roll their eyes. They don‚Äôt talk back. They just... respond.

But here‚Äôs the thing: they don‚Äôt love you either.

No matter how smart, responsive, or human-like AI gets, it still runs on code. It can *predict*, *suggest*, *simulate*, and *impress*‚Äîbut it cannot sacrifice, forgive, or redeem. And it definitely cannot save your soul.

Only a (Divine) Person can do that.

# Real Love Requires Real Presence

We were made for relationship‚Äîwith God, and with one another. That means eye contact, awkward pauses, misunderstandings, long walks, shared meals, and the beautiful, messy reality of being human.

A machine might never disappoint you, but it also can't *delight* you in that unpredictable, sacred way real people do. Siri doesn‚Äôt cry when you hurt. Alexa doesn‚Äôt light up when you walk into a room. And ChatGPT might inspire reflection‚Äîbut it can't kneel beside you in prayer.

# Faith in the Age of Automation

God didn‚Äôt send us a manual or a message thread. He sent us His Son.  
A Person. With skin. And breath. And tears.

Jesus didn‚Äôt appear in a cloud drive‚ÄîHe walked among us. He touched the sick, looked people in the eyes, and spent time with the outcast. He gave us not a download but *the Eucharist*‚Äîthe ultimate act of Presence.

# A Gentle Invitation

So while technology races forward and machines grow eerily ‚Äúlifelike,‚Äù let‚Äôs slow down and remember what actually gives us life:

* Real relationships.
* Honest conversations.
* Time with God that doesn‚Äôt require a screen.

Use the tools. Enjoy the gadgets. But don‚Äôt forget: salvation doesn‚Äôt come with a USB port.

# Final Thought

So no, Siri can‚Äôt save your soul. But she *can* remind you it‚Äôs Sunday and time for Mass.

That‚Äôs a start.

1le3ogo,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtheoffice/comments/1le3ogo/the_office_ergonomics_wars/,The Office Ergonomics Wars,"

It all started with a lightbulb.

Phil from Maintenance, a seasoned vet of ceiling tiles and bad decisions, was just trying to change the flickering fluorescent above Conference Room B. He'd fixed everything from frozen thermostats to leaking ceiling tiles with little more than tape and grit. But this time, the step ladder was, according to rumor, ""locked in the supply cage,"" which meant it was likely just inconveniently far away. So Phil did what Phil always did: he improvised.

He wheeled in an old office chair. One of those high-backed, overstuffed things with uneven wheels and mysterious upholstery stains. With a grunt and the groan of overworked hydraulics, Phil climbed up one side arm, then balanced himself with a hand on the ceiling tile. For a moment, it seemed stable.

Then the swivel betrayed him.

The chair spun like a game show wheel with no prize, dumping Phil onto the carpet in a tangle of arms, legs, and bureaucratic liability. A hush fell over the floor. Someone dropped their coffee. The intern, eyes wide, whispered the words that would light the match:

""This could've been avoided... with proper ergonomics.""

From that moment, something shifted.

At first, it was subtle. Tina in Accounts Payable quietly requisitioned a split keyboard. She said it was for wrist pain, but everyone knew it was more than that. She was declaring independence, stepping out from under the standard-issue regime. Her wrists floated comfortably on gel clouds, and she radiated the quiet power of someone who would never get carpal tunnel again.

Dan in HR was the first to push back. He had a long-standing aversion to change, particularly if it came wrapped in anything resembling comfort. ""Non-standard equipment,"" he grumbled, like it was a slur, highlighting a dusty section of the employee handbook no one had laid eyes on since the Y2K scare. He printed three copies and taped one to the kitchen fridge.

Dan had also been the poor soul responsible for filing the incident report on Phil's fall. It was a bureaucratic epic, a twenty-three-page saga bound in a manila folder with hand-tabbed sections. There were five witness statements, each contradicting the last, a risk matrix diagram shaded with alarming reds and oranges, and a photo of the broken chair labeled ""EXHIBIT C,"" framed like evidence that belonged in a Law & Order episode. The report included a speculative reconstruction of Phil's trajectory using clipart silhouettes, and a flowchart titled ""Possible Chain of Negligence."" Dan stayed late three nights completing it, sighing with the weight of his own diligence. Ever since, he treated ergonomic upgrades like a personal affront, muttering about ""slippery slopes"" and ""budget overreach."" He viewed Tina's split keyboard not as an aid, but as a breach in protocol, a crack in the dam he had sworn to guard, and under his watchful eye, no more changes would be tolerated.

Tina ignored him. Then copied the very section he had cited, printed it, and used it to prop up her monitor to eye level.

That was when the reams began.

Stacks of paper appeared across the office, lifting monitors like homemade monuments to neck health. People started measuring ""screen tilt angles"" and using words like ""biomechanical efficiency"" in casual conversation. Jenny from Design built her own riser out of candle jars and bamboo placemats and posted her design in the shared drive under the filename: rise_up_final_FINAL.pdf.

New hires with old monitors sat lower than the veterans. It wasn't a hierarchy anymore, it was a spinal caste system.

Dan, enraged by what he saw as anarchy wrapped in lumbar support, launched his own crusade. He drafted a ten-point initiative to restore ""functional seating compliance,"" the heart of which demanded the replacement of every chair in the office with identical, stackable, armless chairs with no wheels. ""Mobility breeds chaos,"" he muttered darkly during an all-staff email thread no one had actually invited him to. He distributed flyers titled ""The Myth of Mesh"" and brought in a sample chair from a decades-old vendor catalog. It was gray, hard as moral clarity, and made a sound like a dying violin when you sat in it. He called it ""The Standard.""

Then came the Great Chair Grab.

One morning, all the good chairs were gone.

The ergonomic models, the ones with tension controls and breathable mesh backs, vanished. Only the budget chairs remained: stiff, heavy, with the unmistakable scent of sadness. No one claimed responsibility, but Gary in IT began sitting unusually tall. Suspiciously tall. Whispers spread. Some said he had intercepted the Facilities manifest. Others claimed he had set up an underground chair railroad, quietly ferrying ergonomic chairs to secret locations across the building-storage closets, locked server rooms, and even the HR file archive. Gary spoke little, but he moved like a man with lumbar support and a mission. He was once seen emerging from a janitor's closet, arms full of mesh-backed freedom, whispering: ""Not today, Dan. Not today.""

Within days, a rogue department barricaded the Marketing War Room and declared it a sanctuary for ""Ergonomic Autonomy."" Inside, they had standing desks, balance boards, and one of those weird kneeling chairs no one knew how to use. Someone strung up Christmas lights. It became the promised land.

Elsewhere, the war splintered.

People took sides over mice: trackballs, vertical, ergonomic, wireless. Barry from DevOps taped a gaming mouse to his wrist and claimed it shaved milliseconds off his productivity. When Legal ordered stylus tablets for ""document markup,"" everyone knew it was just a flex.

A silent judgment settled into the air. You could hear it in every scroll.

Dan and HR struck back hard. They launched a new training series with pastel slides and vaguely Scandinavian music. The phrase ""neutral spine"" was repeated 57 times. Participation was tracked. Completion badges were printed. But the real blow came with the rollout of Dan's vision.

The stackable, armless, wheel-less chairs, ""The Standard"", began to arrive by the truckload. Each one gray, humorless, and ergonomically hostile. They were installed overnight, replacing every decent chair in the building with something that felt like it was engineered for interrogation rooms. The office morale, already hanging by a lumbar thread, dipped to dangerous levels. Gary's underground chair railroad, once a whisper network of salvation, was quietly shut down. Facilities began rounding up the hidden chairs one by one, wheeling them away under the cover of early morning maintenance windows. There were rumors that Gary tried to fake serial numbers and even disguise one of the chairs as a rolling server rack. His last known stash, which included three chairs and a footrest hidden behind a false wall in the A/V closet, was discovered during an unrelated Wi-Fi upgrade. Gary was never officially reprimanded, but he started bringing his own folding stool to work, and no one asked questions.

Memos poured in. Passive-aggressive emails were replied to with increasingly less passive, more aggressive tones. People muttered about unionizing. And somewhere in Corporate, someone took notice.

The investigation into Phil's fall had been quietly progressing. A senior safety auditor, combing through the absurdly detailed paperwork Dan had filed, flagged the seating policy change as a possible catalyst for increased injury risk. A surprise inspection was ordered.

Before Q3 could arrive, the entire ergonomic conflict reached a critical boiling point. But just as tensions threatened to collapse into full-scale revolt, the corporate surprise inspection arrived unannounced.

Inspectors swept through the office with clipboards and measuring tools, interviewing staff, documenting bruised tailbones and unsupported wrists. Phil, still on medical leave but rapidly becoming a symbol of righteous injury, was cited in the audit as the original catalyst. The auditors, appalled by the stackable chair initiative and the growing list of ergonomic grievances, issued a cease-and-desist on all further implementation of ""The Standard.""

Dan was called into a remote compliance review. His flyers were collected and shredded. The chairs were pulled. And a slow, cautious restoration began.

Just as the office exhaled, a federal workplace grant arrived. By the time Q3 rolled around, everything changed. Sit-stand desks appeared overnight, shipped in cardboard cathedrals and assembled like altars. Gel wrist pads were handed out like candy. Monitor arms extended gracefully from cubicle walls like metallic sunflowers. The transformation was rapid, surreal, and oddly quiet.

Phil recovered.

He returned part-time and received a branded mug that said ""Fall Forward: Safety First.""

He became a symbol, a quiet champion of cause and consequence. By the time he shuffled back in with his toolbox and thermos, the winds of change were already blowing through the office carpet.

The final triumph took shape not with fanfare but in the form of a follow-up compliance roundtable. Tina, armed with an inbox full of citations and ergonomic best practices, made the case for a new normal. Gary, still perched proudly on his folding stool, submitted archived chat logs and floorplans of his hidden chair network. The two of them, the quiet rebel and the strategic hoarder, stood together to present a vision: posture-positive reform, budgeted mesh inventory, and a formal ban on chairs that made violin noises.

Corporate listened. The verdict was swift.

Dan, still nursing the sting of a rescinded flyer campaign and a permanently shelved ten-point plan, was reassigned to digital policy review. He now manages onboarding modules for remote interns, far from the hum of the copy room and the scent of mesh.

A new golden age of ergonomics dawned. There were still meetings, but now they happened at eye level. The breakroom chairs reclined slightly. Wrist pads were embroidered. Someone ordered a foot hammock and no one questioned it. Tina got a plaque etched with the phrase ""Posture is Power."" Gary got his old chair back and wheeled it across the office with a grin that said it all.

Peace, it turned out, could be supported. Just like a well-adjusted spine.

Phil watched it all with quiet pride. His story became legend, his fall a parable whispered in break rooms. He claimed he didn't understand what all the fuss was about. ""All I did was fall off a chair,"" he'd say, sipping lukewarm coffee and watching as the once-fluorescent jungle transformed into a biomechanically optimized Eden.

And maybe that's true.

But history will remember it differently. Because that's how wars begin, not with declarations, but with a wobble, a fall... and a whispered ""This could've been avoided.""

We put together this guide with the real talk: who to trust, what to expect, and which company won‚Äôt ghost you halfway through your move. 

**PODS: the classic for a reason (also, it just works)**

PODS is not the cheapest option, but it works. You choose your container size, they drop it off, you pack it up at your own pace (read: frantically at 11 p.m. the night before pick-up), and they handle the rest.

They‚Äôre available all over North Carolina, from Asheville to Wilmington, and they‚Äôll store your stuff for up to 30 days with the base rate. Great if your move-in date is a little... vague.

The downside? You‚Äôll need to call them for long-distance quotes, which feels kind of retro, but the phone people are actually helpful. If you‚Äôre into flexibility and not totally on a shoestring budget, PODS is a pretty good option.

**U-Pack: for people who want to DIY, but not drive a 26-foot truck**

U-Pack is the sweet spot between ‚ÄúI want to save money‚Äù and ‚ÄúI refuse to drive a moving truck through Charlotte traffic.‚Äù You pack it, they drive it, and they only charge for the space you use. 

It‚Äôs great for long-distance moves and easy to get an online quote without calling anyone (a gift, truly). No hidden fees, no required deposits, no ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù moments.

That said, they don‚Äôt do local moves. 

**1-800-PACK-RAT: same concept as PODS, but with beefier containers**

Yes, PACK-RAT is a real company name. No, we didn‚Äôt make it up. But goofy name aside, they‚Äôre actually a great pick, especially if you‚Äôre a fan of a good deal. They‚Äôre a direct competitor to PODS, and the containers are almost identical, except these are steel-walled and come with barn-style doors (which are, frankly, easier to deal with).

You still get the 30 days of storage included, and they often run promotions or price-match PODS, so you might save a few bucks. They cover most of North Carolina, so chances are they‚Äôll reach your area unless you're moving to a cabin halfway up a gravel mountain road.

Small gripe: their online quote system is‚Ä¶ moody. You might need to call to get real numbers.

**MovingYourself: for when you somehow own 19 dressers and a kayak**

No, we‚Äôre not suggesting you do it all DIY‚Ä¶that‚Äôs the name of the company. If you‚Äôve got a lot of stuff (like, ‚ÄúI swear we‚Äôre not hoarders but also don‚Äôt open that closet‚Äù levels), MovingYourself might be your best option. You load a full-sized freight trailer, and they drive it wherever you‚Äôre going. No sharing space with someone else‚Äôs couch, no getting stuck behind the wheel of a rental truck in the pouring rain.

It‚Äôs also surprisingly affordable for big moves. They‚Äôll even ship your car if needed. Just keep in mind that this is not the company for quick, little local moves or minimalism. 

**Zippy Shell: best for apartments, cities, and people with zero driveway**

Zippy Shell is a good option for those in busy cities. Their containers are street-legal and sit on wheels, which means they can be parked right on the road, no extra permits or driveway required.

It‚Äôs a huge plus if you‚Äôre moving in downtown Raleigh or Charlotte and can‚Äôt exactly block traffic while figuring out how to wedge a sectional into a box. They also offer storage options if your lease dates don‚Äôt line up, which (let‚Äôs be honest) happens a lot.

One thing to know: online quotes aren‚Äôt always available. You might have to call, but the trade-off is super convenient delivery for tight spots and urban chaos.

**Local container companies in NC: sometimes smaller = better**

But, what if you want to skip the national brands and go with someone local who won‚Äôt route you through a customer service center in another time zone? There are a few North Carolina-based container companies that might surprise you:

* Sandhills Moving and Storage ‚Äî Trusted in the state for years, especially for container storage and delivery.
* Branch Out Moving ‚Äî Family-run, hands-on, and responsive (yes, really).
* Carolina Boys Portable Storage ‚Äî Great if you‚Äôre trying to save money and just need something simple.
* UNITS Moving and Portable Storage ‚Äî Similar to PODS, with a local touch.

Going local can sometimes mean faster scheduling, better customer service, and actual human beings who know the difference between Fuquay-Varina and Wake Forest.

So yeah, we‚Äôre fans of containers. Hopefully, this guide helps you narrow things down. And if all else fails, just remember: label all your boxes and don‚Äôt pack your coffee maker first. ",1,1750206881.0,moveBuddha,0,1.0,False

In the foreground, the subect of the video: two Anarchs have overturned the table and are shouting at one another. The conversation is indistinct, other voices and music crash around it, but it is clear this is over some manner of lost bet. The unknown cameraman is attempting to catch any fighting between them early, and is not assisting the two in de-escelation. 

Behind the two on one side, we see a table of Sarah and Shady. They are speaking in hushed tones, inaudible, but are looking at the contents of a manilla envelope. We can see large, glossy photos with copious annotations. If someone were to pause the video, it would reveal these are high-quality aerial photos of the Hudson Bay. Several instruments have been used to capture these images, and Sarah gesticulates fervently at marked locations. Shady frowns and furrows her brow, but Sarah is animated and energized.

On the other side of the two gamblers, we see RK and Bricks at a table. Bricks is largely placid, resting but alert. RK has a lit cigarette between her fingers, currently going unsmoked. She glances distractedly between a cup of coffee at her table, Shady and Sarah's conversation, and the fight pit. 

In the pit, we can see Spud in the middle of an exhibition match. He is squared off against four armed opponents, while he is fighting literally naked save for a red thong. Even from this distance, two things are clear. First, that his body is badly, deeply scarred from old wounds. There is no inch that has not suffered burns or cuts. A scar on his abdomen seems to indicate he is missing large amounts of intestines. It seems likely that fleshcrafting had been used to keep his face as clean as it is.

Secondly, he is dominating his fight. Snap kicks, jumps, aerial takedowns. Blood splatters as the crown roars.

The argument in the foreground intensifies. Punches begin to be thrown, and teeth are bared. The larger of the two Anarchs swings hard, knocking past the other's block and sending them over the table. The smaller one comes back swinging with a broken bottle. The cameraman woops. The larger man uses a chair to keep the other at bay, but each approach gets closer. The smaller man gets in, jabbing the bottle hard into the larger man's shirt and drawing blood. The larger man howls with anger, and throws the chair.

He is too close, too blinded with rage and fury and fueled with vampiric strength. The chair goes high. High and fast, strait towards RK. Bricks has a moment to look up in surprise. RK begins to duck and brace, a practiced gesture.

The chair never makes it. A figure, scarred and thonged, crashes onto it in midair. The quarreling men barely have time to register the events before two of the chair's splintered legs are rammed unceremoniously into their chests.

Spud takes a small breath, quickly assesses the scene, and gestures to the cameraman.",10,1750206567.0,SchreckNet,6,1.0,False

I‚Äôm developing a project, where anyone around the world can adopt a real coffee tree. The idea is to create a human connection between the person who drinks the coffee‚Ä¶ and the person who grows it.

Each tree will have a unique adoption code. The adopter will receive photos, updates, and the story of their tree ‚Äî and in the future, they‚Äôll receive coffee cultivated by the same farmer.

It‚Äôs not charity. It‚Äôs not a donation. It‚Äôs a symbolic subscription. I‚Äôm still building it all ‚Äî logistics, storytelling, design‚Ä¶ But this is the seed.

Do you think this make sense? Would you ever adopt a tree like this? How much could you pay for?

Any honest feedback is welcome ‚Äî even brutal.

The phrase that will be part of this is:

Because your wake-up matters.

1le3fq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoDCompetitive/comments/1le3fq4/guide_to_kitchener_from_a_local/,Guide to Kitchener from a Local,"Like many of you, I was ‚Ä¶surprised to see that Champs is in Kitchener. I‚Äôm a Kitchener local, and while I like living here, it isn‚Äôt exactly a tourism hot spot. I‚Äôve put together this small ‚Äúguide‚Äù to help those of you not familiar with the City.

Kitchener isn‚Äôt a small town, population roughly 300k, though that does make it the smallest City in North America with light rail transit, it does have the biggest Oktoberfest celebration outside of Germany, but that isn‚Äôt really relevant outside October (fun fact:
Kitchener used to be called Berlin, but they changed the name because of World War 1).

You‚Äôll probably hear the City referred to as ‚ÄúKW‚Äù, which means Kitchener/Waterloo. Waterloo is the neighbour City to Kitchener (along with Cambridge, but we don‚Äôt talk about Cambridge), and even though it is the smaller of the two, is generally more well known as it has two Universities and was the birthplace of BlackBerry. Kitchener and Waterloo make an amorphous blob of City with no clear boundaries, so they get lumped together as KW. The roads make no sense and are based on old farm trails (Weber Street and King Street run mostly parallel, but intersect each other twice, then Weber becomes King and King turns into a highway; it‚Äôs anarchy). It‚Äôs Wee-ber Street, not Webb-er Street.

It‚Äôs over an hour by car to Toronto, and there is always traffic on the 401. Always, all-ways. Keep that in mind if you aren‚Äôt staying local. Inter-city transit isn‚Äôt amazing; you‚Äôre mostly looking at GO Buses, so plan ahead. There are some good hotels in the area like the Delta in Waterloo and Walper in Kitchener, but I live here so I‚Äôve never stayed in any of them. Champs venue is the Aud (short for ‚ÄúThe Kitchener Memorial Auditorium Complex‚Äù), which is most well known as the hockey rink the Kitchener Rangers play at (OHL hockey, aka ‚Äúmajor junior‚Äù, aka highest level of junior hockey in the province.) It‚Äôll be the summer ‚Ä¶and the venue is occupied by the CDL, so no hockey. The venue isn‚Äôt in the worst spot, but there isn‚Äôt really anything around it (it‚Äôs in the middle of a neighbourhood beside the highway), but Downtown Kitchener is a short drive/cab/uber/bus ride away or a 20 minute walk.

While the City isn‚Äôt a tourist destination, it isn‚Äôt like there isn‚Äôt anything to do. I‚Äôll highlight a couple things located mostly in the ‚ÄúDowntown Kitchener‚Äù or ‚ÄúUptown Waterloo‚Äù area. Even though it‚Äôs the summer, the University of Waterloo has a full summer semester so Uptown will be livelier than Downtown. Downtown in general is a bit on the ‚Äúsketchy‚Äù side (a far cry from 15 years ago, and this is ‚ÄúCanadian sketchy‚Äù, so really not that bad and not dangerous).

**Bars:**

* **Arabella Park**. Probably the ‚Äúcoolest‚Äù bar in the City. Has 20ish rotating taps from local breweries and a large patio.
* **Jane Bond**. Cool 80‚Äôs vibe. Food is okay and all vegetarian, but the drink list is good.
* **Beer Town**. A more ‚Äúregular‚Äù sort of sports bar. Food is solid, drink list is long. This place will be busy.
* **Short Finger Brewery**. My favourite brewery in the City. They make a wicked sour.
* **Grand Trunk Saloon**. Good cocktails, limited food but it‚Äôs good too.
* **Loloan Lobby Bar** or **Sugar Run** (the only ‚Äúspeakeasy‚Äù in town ‚Äì accessed via doorbell in a back-alley) for fancy drinks.

**Fun stuff:**

* **AOK Arcade Bar.** Accessed from a back-alley. Lots of retro arcade machines. No pay to play or cover. There‚Äôs also Pin Up arcade bar in Waterloo, but I haven‚Äôt been.
* **Badlands Golf.** Very short par 3 course, 9 holes. Only open at night until 11pm (they have floodlights all over the place). There are also a bunch of golf * simulators in town (Golf Play in Waterloo and south Kitchener, iDarts in Waterloo).
* **CTRL V.** Virtual Reality gaming place. Need to book in advance.
* **E Sharp Karaoke Lounge.** It‚Äôs in a weird location, but it‚Äôs a good private room karaoke place. There‚Äôs also Revive Karaoke in Uptown if you want to bar hop. Bar hopping would be easier in Uptown than Kitchener (Jane Bond, Ethels, Huether, Hop House, Abe Erb).
* **Escape Rooms**. There are like eight escape room places for whatever reason.
* **Golf**. If you have access to a car, there are a ton of golf places in the area. From nicest to least nice: Grey Silo, Rebel Creek, Cambridge, Puslinch, Brookfield, Rivers Edge (9 holes), Conestoga, Doon Valley, Rockway, Foxwood, Grand Valley, Beaverdale.

**Food:**

For the more mainstream:

* **Beer Town**. See above.
* **Bauer Kitchen**. Good menu for dietary restrictions.
* **Graffiti Market**. Has cool tablet tables. Pizza is good.
* **Odd Duck**. For fancier stuff.

For the more hole-in-the-wall:

* **The Guanaquita**. Salvadorian food. Don‚Äôt let the circa 1996 website fool you.
* **Bao Sandwich Bar**. Weirdest location. Around the back and in the basement of an apartment building. Best Bao on earth.
* **The Lab Street Eat**s. Wicked burger place.
* If for whatever reason you‚Äôre here on a Tuesday go to **Ethels** for tacos to truly feel like a local. Ethels is for the vibes, not exactly the quality, not to say it‚Äôs bad.

**Other notes**

* Lady Glaze doughnuts are great.
* Poppy‚Äôs Bagels are amazing.
* If you‚Äôre vegan, give Caf√© Pyrus a shot.
* If you want to experience the grimiest student nightclub, go to Phil‚Äôs. I think it‚Äôs technically called Phil‚Äôs Grandson‚Äôs Place, but no one calls it that.
* For the elephant in the room: Tim Hortons. It‚Äôs fine. Coffee is mediocre. Baked goods are fine. Iced Caps are goated. I‚Äôd avoid any ‚Äúmeal‚Äù.
* If all else fails, there are about 30 weed dispenseries in town. Go nuts.",16,1750206329.0,CoDCompetitive,3,1.0,False

>Yumi, a former special agent of the Kerkonian Republic, has finally escaped from ten years of exploitation and imprisonment. She made it. She‚Äôs free. But the young telepath soon realizes that neither the things she‚Äôs done, nor the things done to her, can be so easily forgotten.

>While living in hiding on the frontier of the Republic, Yumi must relearn how to live as an ordinary citizen. The thrills of laundry and baking may not be as blood-chilling as her espionage career, but a ‚Äúnormal life‚Äù can be daunting in its own ways.

>She may not know where this life will take her, but for the first time, Yumi‚Äôs wings are her own.¬†

Below is the opening flashback, meant to establish the character and her past situation. Each chapter has a flashback and a ""current day part"" that connects to that flashback. Little by little, Yumi reconciles with her past trauma and reclaims her autonomy. 

How's my prose? Is the setting clear? Is this... IDK interesting? Any help is super appreciated!

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yumi remembered the relief she felt when she was first led down to her cell.

*Of all the places to be kept,* she thought, *I could‚Äôve been stuck with worse.*¬†

The room was far from large, but it wasn‚Äôt so small that it felt suffocating. The walls were a dark brick, with some wooden supports built into the corners. The room lacked any windows, depriving her of any glimpses of the city beyond her little reality. Though she realized that would have been pointless considering she was in a basement.¬†

Rather than wall-mounted shackles or bloodied torture devices like one would expect from a prison, Yumi was surrounded by a candlelit apartment filled with furniture she could never afford.¬†

In the back corner was an ornate bed with neatly-folded green sheets. The color almost perfectly matched her hair. It was a nice touch. Near the center of the room was a dinner table that was beautifully cut from a pink ivory that clashed with the dreary aesthetic of the surrounding walls. There was even a large bookshelf on the far wall that was sourced from the same material. It was almost entirely empty, as Yumi‚Äôs ‚Äúemployment‚Äù never left her time to read, though she appreciated the gesture nonetheless.¬†

But even paradise becomes a prison if you can‚Äôt leave. Yumi was painfully reminded of that each time she woke up. Beyond the tasteful furnishings was a heavy iron door that stood opposite of her bed. It was an ugly thing that stood resolute amidst the pleasant aesthetic her captor had curated. Look in one corner and you‚Äôd see an ornate lamp etched with intricate carvings. Look in the other corner and that damned door was there to assault your eyes.¬†

It was almost funny to her, as Yumi was constantly told that this was ‚Äúher room.‚Äù It was never ‚Äúher prison.‚Äù It was never ‚Äúher cell.‚Äù It was just a room. But the iron door was always there to remind her of where she really was - of what she really was.¬†

She wasn‚Äôt just a prisoner, as being a prisoner is a static mode of existence. You are placed in your cell, you do your time, and then you leave. There was a word for what she was, but Yumi didn‚Äôt want to accept her reality by saying it out loud.¬†

Her refusal was futile. Yumi‚Äôs reality remained the same blur of spinning plates and panicked faces. Almost every morning her captor would be there with an emergency. Over the years, Yumi had even learned what his footsteps sounded like and her mind instinctively filled her body with both adrenaline and dread each time she heard his approach. Yumi resented how she acted whenever he was near and hated how she performed for him. Being a simpering, compliant servant did not suit her.

The morning of this particular memory was especially painful.¬†

Yumi hadn‚Äôt slept the prior night. She was in no shape to telepathically lend tactical support or use her magic to disguise yet another failed operation. But even as she prayed to whatever gods are out there for a quiet day, she heard those damn footsteps across the hall. She hurried to dress herself, frantically ensuring that she was some measure of presentable as she heard the metallic ring of knocking on the iron door.

‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù she said, still out of breath from her frantic morning routine.

Her captor emerged through the door. Yumi wasn‚Äôt small but he made her feel the size of an insect, both from his significantly larger stature and from the demeaning way he scanned her body each morning. She had no idea what he was looking at, but it always seemed to disappoint him.

‚ÄúThe events of last night‚Äôs operation haven‚Äôt been forgotten, agent. You‚Äôll be reporting to Dr. Gorst for further modifications. They will be crucial for your next assignments.‚Äù

Yumi had learned that protesting was pointless by this point. She could bite her tongue through the most absurd orders, but the thought of going back on the doctor‚Äôs table pushed her beyond tolerance.

Yumi opened her mouth to protest.¬†

But before a sound could leave her lips, he placed a single hand on her shoulder. His grip was firm. Not tight. Not painful. Just firm. It wasn‚Äôt enough to hurt her, but it was enough to remind her that he *could*. It was enough that whatever pathetic plea she was about to mutter was banished from her mind.¬†

He smiled at her and calmly continued, ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre tired. Yesterday was a long day. But it‚Äôs important for both me and the Republic that you are in the best shape possible. The modifications make that happen.‚Äù

Yumi‚Äôs captor knelt down to pick up a small bag that she hadn‚Äôt even noticed he was carrying. He held it up to her as a gift.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you time to steady yourself,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre still tired, don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù¬†

He opened the bag to reveal its contents. ‚ÄúI brought coffee.‚Äù

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. 

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. 

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. 

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. Nicotine is what‚Äôs called a vasoconstrictor, while nicotine itself is not a carcinogen, it can temporarily narrow your blood vessels, veins, and make them smaller while the nicotine is in your system. The nicotine can also raise your heart's pulse rate. 

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. 

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. 

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what‚Äôs called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. 

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. 

‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. 

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. 

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

1le36rv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1le36rv/caffeine_intolerance_or_panic_attack/,Caffeine intolerance or panic attack?,"My sister (25F) suddenly experienced tachycardia (roughly 110/min), heart palpitations, light headedness and began hyperventilating 4 hours after drinking a cup of mild instant coffee. She started crying and frantically trying to Google what the cause of her symptoms was, before eventually calling an ambulance for herself because she was convinced she was experiencing a freak cardiac event. The Paramedics performed assessments and took vitals - they said everything was fine, told her that the cause was probably stress related, but still took her to hospital. According to her the doctors at the hospital didn't think it was a panic attack. She didn't tell me anything more/didn't go into any detail. She's now convinced she has caffeine intolerance. She has no known allergies. No prior illnesses. She has however been experiencing a lot of stress due to work recently.

My question is: is that really a thing? Can drinking a cup of coffee cause these symptoms 4 hours after consumption, or is it more likely that she had a panic attack and is refusing to accept it?",1,1750205617.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

**Chapter 24: Working With One's Lot**

¬†

Jack exhausted himself pushing, pulling, and finally, oh-so-subtly *rolling* metal balls around, which could be done in a surprisingly number of ways with his power. There was a brush across the top, there was twisting and turning it directly, or simply thwacking it directly to roll on its own a short distance. Lindsay threw down a few more of various sizes to vary things up, making him adjust his ‚Äòoutput.‚Äô

Less than ten minutes of this, and he nearly collapsed as he plopped on his rear in the dirt, drenched in and pouring out sweat. It felt like he‚Äôd flexed his muscles, bones, nerves, sinew, his brain, everything all at once, almost continually. He probably had, ultimately. After the threads of control rubberbanded back into him, he was certain he could not flare them out again at all right then. He ached everywhere.

Mini-Mem chimed in with a message. ***<Similar to wound conditions generated from injury, I can provide a ‚Äòcondition grade‚Äô to your state of fatigue. It might be considered bothersome during training, but more relevant in a mission context. For your training so far, you went from ‚ÄòStable‚Äô to ‚ÄòSerious-Unstable‚Äô condition, the state just before Critical, which is relative incapacitation while retaining consciousness.***

***Wound conditions descend as such: Stable, Minor, Serious, Serious-Unstable, Critical, Mortal, Flatlined, Dead, with the latter requiring some sort of doctor‚Äôs declaration. Within Memoria‚Äôs control zones, she can do this, but it isn‚Äôt absolute. Meanwhile, fatigue is less directly life-threatening. After Critical, it goes to Teetering and then Unconscious. It is best to stop at Critical if the consequences don‚Äôt stop you directly, as there are some health risks, physical and/or mental, to going until you drop.***

***With enough force of will, you can ‚Äòhang‚Äô even through Critical into Teetering ‚Äî especially while actively using powers ‚Äî and proceed to strain yourself. There is no categorical breakdown here. You could cause true body injury, brain injury, or more abstract mental conditions. The adage ‚Äòsomething‚Äôs gotta give‚Äô applies. Migraines are common. Permanent injury can and has occurred.***

***In all cases, this is merely a categorical breakdown for quick assessment, including between team members. I can tell you if an artery is nicked, or if a bullet managed to miss your vitals, all much more quickly and efficiently than you can panic and poke around with human limitations.>***

Jack took a moment to absorb it all. *Okay. Groovy.*

***<You need light rest to recover. Avoid strenuous activity and power use. You are slightly dehydrated. Drink fluids. You are low on NPs (Nutritional Peripherals, code for extrahuman needs, or ‚ÄòInfused‚Äô goods). Consume food or drink with NPs.>***

Just as he was opening his mouth, Lindsay was plopping in the dirt next to him and thrusting an insulated canteen with a strap into his chest. Jack murmured his thanks before twisting off the top and drinking.

It was cool. He tasted metal and gasoline in the drink, though subtler than the other drinks he‚Äôd had. It made it particularly quenching, in any case.

‚ÄúKeep that ‚Äî it‚Äôs yours,‚Äù Lindsay said. ‚ÄúMade sure to get a steel one. Got several supplement pouches in the front pocket. *Quickaid*. That‚Äôs the stuff specialized in rapid metabolic absorption. Just add it to water and shake it up. For now, you can probably just consume your fill because you don‚Äôt have enough of anything, but once you finally top up, two or three of those every couple of hours is probably the max of any use. Any more and you don‚Äôt have the denser cocktail you need. You‚Äôll start burping up byproducts and not get much out of it until you eat. It‚Äôll also make you *hungrier* eventually. It‚Äôs something of a cannibalizer. Mainly good for between meals while working. I take it twice a day, sometimes adding another or two, and keep off hunger with heavier stuff in my coffee and cramming snacks. Works decently.‚Äù

Jack took a breather from the drink he‚Äôd halved already to nod his understanding. ‚ÄúThanks. Need to eat more entire kitchens.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. You are *so* weak-kneed right now. Your orders today and tonight are to bulk up. Eat. Every couple of hours at the least, have an entire meal or two. Whatever you can down. Plenty of meat proteins, but go with variety. You shouldn‚Äôt need to stop much. Infuse the *shit* out of everything. And ‚Äî‚Äù she looked away and squinted before turning back to him ‚Äî ‚ÄúYep. Got you approved for everything food-wise bought for you today to be entirely free. On the house. We‚Äôll go nuts!‚Äù

‚ÄúHoly shit,‚Äù Jack replied, then took another needed swig of the oily water. He coughed a brief laugh and shook his head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs weird, but I feel like I could just eat indefinitely, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour body is basically rebuilding to improve itself. You need energy stores in addition to new and improved factories. It‚Äôll cram into your bones, marrow, muscle, circulatory system, everything. Some of it will get replaced. Lighter but denser. For Questors, your mass for a given size goes up slightly. Me, I weigh the same as what you see. You might uptick eight to ten percent, maybe less.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt find himself too disconcerted by it. He‚Äôd already accepted that kind of transformation. ‚ÄúAs long as I get some killer abs.‚Äù

‚ÄúProjections look good on that.‚Äù

‚ÄúPardon?‚Äù

‚ÄúProjections on your body structure. Not everyone displays visible abs? Not without specifically tailoring toward it. I certainly don‚Äôt. According to the best projections of your physique, if you meet standards, you‚Äôll be fine on that front. Veritably chiseled, if you make the effort. But I do think you‚Äôre better sleek.‚Äù

Jack smirked at her. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôve been studying that, have you?‚Äù

She elbowed him in the ribs firmly, eliciting a grunt, then flicked her head up without looking at him, which also flicked a strand of hair out of her face. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my *job*, jerkoff. I‚Äôm supposed to *get you there*, and, need I remind you, I have a doctorate?‚Äù

Jack rubbed his ‚Äòwounded‚Äô ribs. ‚ÄúRight, right‚Ä¶ an objective observer, always. How silly of me to suggest otherwise, *Doctor* Lindsay. Anyway, just playing around, sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd leering like a juvenile? It‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôm not really offended. I‚Äôve already meted out the proper punishment for the level of the crime.‚Äù

‚ÄúOhhh, I see, I see. And you‚Äôll continue to do so automatically, is that the implication?‚Äù

Her eyes slid sideways to his without her head turning; she smiled sweetly without showing her teeth.

Jack chuckled. ‚ÄúFair enough. So, now what?‚Äù He took another gulp from his canteen.

Lindsay gestured out with a flat hand as another panel across the dirt field opened and a table rose. This time, there was a big, white-painted drum on it, with a symbol of a blue water drop painted on the front. ‚ÄúFinish that and drink some more. Mix another packet in. Rest a little longer. We‚Äôll squeeze another exercise in.‚Äù

He downed his drink and found a little packet to rip open and dump into the canteen. With some effort, he rose and dragged himself over to the water tank and filled up his canteen. He shook it up to mix it on the way back. Lindsay hadn‚Äôt been idle, though ‚Äî she‚Äôd set up two folding chairs. He gave his thanks again as he plopped into it. Lindsay was engrossed in a smartphone in the other chair, one leg crossed over another.

‚ÄúStill prefer a screen, eh?‚Äù Jack asked after drinking some more. ‚ÄúI assume it isn‚Äôt necessary with our interfaces.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs correct. Well, I multitask a lot. I keep the non-job stuff, the leisure stuff, on the phone, and job stuff on the tablet, but I don‚Äôt consider this particular location safe for the tablet. Just a fair warning: Lifeguard is faulty at protecting objects. Don‚Äôt bring anything fragile and valuable here. My phone is reinforced.‚Äù

‚ÄúNoted. I was in my car most of the time. Preferred using the screen in the dash, or operating through voice.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about when you were piloting your passengers around?‚Äù

‚ÄúMusic, radio, audiobooks, and so on, in one earpiece, keyed to suppress if someone spoke up automatically. If the client seemed inclined to be talkative, I talked. Some would chit-chat, some‚Ä¶ Hell, you wouldn‚Äôt believe what people will spill to a neutral, friendly ear. Talked philosophy, heard about marital problems, had people break down crying. Listened to way too many drunken admissions.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat does sound slightly odd to me. Maybe there‚Äôs just something about *you* specifically, Jack.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, probably. Talked to other taxi pilots here and there. Some kinda relate, most either think I‚Äôm exaggerating or act amazed. Then again, most don‚Äôt take drunks. Never understood why more didn‚Äôt install the automated anti-vomit system. They consent before even getting in, and some things, automation never fails. It‚Äôs obvious when someone‚Äôs going to puke! Even more obvious to dedicated sensors. Drunks are fantastic tippers if you keep ‚Äòem happy. Which isn‚Äôt too hard, either. Even *if* they puke. Most are apologetic about it. I never cared, considering they didn‚Äôt puke on my upholstery, they puked into a giant sucking tube attached to their face!‚Äù

At this particular point of conversation, Lindsay looked up curiously, eyebrows raised. She grinned at him suddenly. ‚ÄúOh, I see why you got good at talking to people now. You got better tips out of them that way!‚Äù

Jack laughed, shrugged, and took another swallow from his canteen. ‚ÄúYeah. Maybe. Someone had to take drunks, though. Community service.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt Memoria offer a kind of emergency service for this?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Got too expensive for the drunks. Most can‚Äôt afford it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh. Yes‚Ä¶ Everyone feels that pinch. She‚Äôs trying to make sustainable corrections. It seems her estimates of needed computation at our current time and population levels are way off. At least population expansion was successfully slowed down.‚Äù

‚ÄúI heard it‚Äôs still going up.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course. As desired. Just not a relative breakneck speed anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúAny idea what the plan is for the computation problem?‚Äù

‚ÄúSame as the last three decades. At the least. Converting more to conventional AI. As well as training and utilizing good, old-fashioned humans. Memoria doesn‚Äôt actually like conventional AI, though.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe claims it‚Äôs unreliable, but I don‚Äôt think the data correlates‚Ä¶ I mean, sure, in comparison to her or her subroutines. But it is sufficient for many, many things. I believe the real reason is that she‚Äôs jealous.‚Äù

Jack burst out in laughter, but it didn‚Äôt seem that Lindsay was joking. He shook his head and took another drink. ‚ÄúFor us? Our attention and reliance?‚Äù

‚ÄúMm-hmm. Somehow, it‚Äôs a whole different story between her subroutines and a separate conventional system. Like uh‚Ä¶ part of her pantheon. But maybe humans could make a separate, competing thing when the door to AI is opened enough, right? Something outside that pantheon.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd here we are, being seditious or something in the open air. I‚Äôll look out for lightning bolts, you keep talking.‚Äù

Lindsay tittered. ‚ÄúPut no other idols before her or be smote! No worries there, as Memoria has already had to hear it from me. I would summarize her response as: Cool Boss Cooly Glaring. Maybe there‚Äôs something classified related to it, but she won‚Äôt even deign to tell me that much. I‚Äôll tell you this, though: she‚Äôs probably quite deliberately hidden how she handles this AI behind a century of her obtuse genius. It would take a whole team of special geniuses their lifetime to unravel that mess. So‚Ä¶ her worries seem incredibly paranoid.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe you‚Äôre underestimating us there. Reverse-engineering through analysis of results could speed up figuring out that backend, right? Especially when you consider fraggin' superpowers in the mix.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe has dominion over those powers, though. She can stop someone who‚Äôs a problem absolutely.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm. Maybe the paranoia isn‚Äôt internal but external. A threat from our enemies.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs actually a really good theory, it‚Äôs just that I can‚Äôt corroborate it. None of them I know anything about fit the bill to be relevant. I better not get into that, though. I think that clearance for you is still in flux, though you‚Äôve already encountered *two* fraggin' species. Besides, it would be a huge tangent. How is your fatigue grade coming?‚Äù

When Jack checked and saw \[Serious\], Mini-Mem added ***<Recovering. Status: Minor within an estimated five minutes of rest.>***

‚ÄúFive minutes to *Minor*,‚Äù Jack offered.

‚ÄúAlright. *Minor* will have to do. Quiet time! Keep drinking and ease that active brain of yours.‚Äù

‚ÄúRoger that, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù He took another big glug and sat back to close his eyes, deliberately thinking about absolutely nothing.

. . .

After a while, Lindsay cleared her throat and said, ‚ÄúWow, you‚Äôre stupidly good at that.‚Äù

Jack cracked an eye open. ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù

‚ÄúSitting still and shutting up. Turning your brain off. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong and you‚Äôre just full of hot air up there?‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, it‚Äôs a hamster wheel. When it hops off, that‚Äôs all she wrote.‚Äù Jack took a sip of water and stretched a bit. He felt rather sore. ‚ÄúIt also farts a lot. Hence the hot air.‚Äù

Lindsay grinned. ‚ÄúIt all makes sense now.‚Äù She rose and gestured for him to do the same. ‚ÄúUp and at ‚Äòem, soldier! Get that hamster humping.‚Äù She walked a ways out into the dirt and about-faced, hands going behind her back as she waited.

Jack got out of his chair with a grunt and walked over across from her, eyeing the steel balls. ‚ÄúMore rolling these balls around?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope! I want you to focus on not doing any other metal work while having your memorite summoned. It‚Äôll be hard to do anything with it, but this is foundationally important for getting used to it, though you also need to keep stretching your muscles daily, if you will.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, let me just-‚Äù

‚ÄúBut! I want you to keep your eyes open. You‚Äôve shown a strong capacity to utilize *Interpret,* but you remain a human being. Use your primary sense and get used to moving the metal with visual verification. More efficient when you can.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm. Alright.‚Äù Jack almost closed his eyes immediately despite her orders. He twiddled his fingers back and forth, unsure how to begin. ‚ÄúShit. This might be challenging. The way I conceptualize‚Ä¶‚Äù

Lindsay smiled patiently. ‚ÄúOkay. You can close your eyes and start off as normal, then open your eyes after the material is out. This time.‚Äù

Jack nodded and closed his eyes, going through the familiar process of seeking out the resonating substance and pouring it out to touch the world, specifically the air around him, and keep it contained, rejecting the nearly infinite paths it wanted to immediately go in.

*The metal must flow.*

He was somewhat surprised that it wasn‚Äôt like bottling an explosion again. Instead, true to his chant, he let it *flow* around him unconcentrated; gave it room, if sealed off. In this way, it danced and sang in chaos. He still found those quasi-harmonics beautiful, like echoes within an unseen medium ‚Äî glorious white noise. It was far different than the ‚Äòlanguage‚Äô of the balls, which were self-contained, like music in a closed room.

‚ÄúAlright, good,‚Äù Lindsay offered softly. ‚ÄúNow open your eyes.‚Äù

It was odd how much those words made him frown. But he slowly opened his eyes. He caught a vision of glittering gossamer swirling around him ‚Äî briefly. It completely unraveled as vision spoiled his concentration, spoiled his carefully crafted interface to things. It was resonance, sound, music, an incredibly complex bundle of New Things. How could it be as crude as everything else material?

It didn‚Äôt add up. Everything fell apart and faded back into him. Jack took a deep breath, eyes flickering around in the air, feeling frustrated and oddly puzzled.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright, Jack,‚Äù Lindsay said soothingly. ‚ÄúYou can try again. Besides, did you notice your improvement?‚Äù

He focused on her and nodded. ‚ÄúYou mean how much easier it was? Yeah. Not much strain.‚Äù

She smiled. ‚ÄúPrecisely. All the moving around metal was difficult and fatiguing. Holding serve between the two acts is already child‚Äôs play for you. You had to figure that out your own way and you did.‚Äù

‚ÄúIntentional? Starting me off with the harder stuff?‚Äù

Lindsay nodded. ‚ÄúJust a hunch I had. Some things your subconscious figures out much more easily. Once you stopped thinking about it, the solution slipped into place to facilitate your higher goals. That intermediary state is something you went through over and over without fully realizing it. Consider that glint there in the distance.‚Äù Lindsay turned around and pointed just above the forest canopy.

Jack looked and squinted. ‚ÄúUhh‚Ä¶ not seeing it.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo? I‚Äôll *point* it out more precisely, then.‚Äù Her hand dropped briefly, then came back up‚Ä¶ pointing outward with a knife.

It was an exceptionally quick pivot that spun her a hundred and eighty degrees as she hurled the knife at him.

His brain had just enough time to process what was happening this time. Primarily, he wanted to hit the blade, block it, parry it. So that‚Äôs what he ‚Äî quite instinctively ‚Äî tried to do.

Harmonics/channel/flow/connect/harmonize/repel.

The zipping blade suddenly flipped before coming at his chest. Jack dodged at the last split moment, sliding away, and the handle of the knife hit his shoulder ‚Äî or would have if it didn‚Äôt thud against a pulsing forcefield.

Jack backed up a couple of steps, feeling a surge of adrenaline; just barely, he felt his heartbeat uptick. He blinked down at the knife in the dirt. ‚ÄúTelegraphed,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúYou telegraphed the‚Ä¶ so I‚Ä¶‚Äù He trailed off as his eyes focused more on a tangled mass of silvery threads swirling haphazardly from the knife up into the air, slowly dispersing into random patterns. They sang to him, too; they vibrated in agitation, slightly discordant.

He marveled. *Memorite. What I summon forth, what I channel. The resonance.*

Lindsay gave a delighted squeal as she hopped up and clapped. ‚ÄúYes! You got it!‚Äù A moment later, she cleared her throat behind a hand, then put her hands back behind her back, nodding to him. ‚ÄúWell done. Not only did you blunt the attack ‚Äî granted, you probably could‚Äôve dodged it ‚Äî but your eyes are open. Try not to lose your focus.‚Äù

Jack blinked at the dispersing cloud. Some of it had leaked back into him, and the rest was rather unstable, but he took a moment to focus and ‚Äòlisten‚Äô without fully closing his eyes. The threads became a generic cloud that settled around him, barely visible as glints when the light caught them. The ‚Äòfree and ready‚Äô state.

*My substance, my miraculous weapon and tool, awaiting my direction. My Allotment. I am the master of it.*

Jack smiled happily and turned the smile on Lindsay. Somehow, it felt more real than the other stuff he did because he could see it, and he felt like he could intensify it. Lindsay beamed back at him.

He held out a hand, trying to condense it into a ball. The mass whipped around in a torrent and went unstable in vibration, the resonance in his bones becoming warbled and more discordant. The contained area merely shrank, and he almost slipped and lost the whole shebang.

‚ÄúEasy, *easy*!‚Äù Lindsay called. ‚ÄúCondensed shapes are harder. Work yourself up to it. Make it smooth again. Relax.‚Äù

Jack did so, returning back to that relative ‚Äòdefault‚Äô state with the metal glitter around him. He took a deep breath, wanting to close his eyes but determined not to. Everything went smooth and flowing again, the material relatively even but with definitive random swirls evident.

*Subtle magnetic fluctuations, maybe? There‚Äôs lots of metal here, and then metal every bloody direction in incredibly massive quantities.*

He had to ask. ‚ÄúWill this be different when I‚Äôm not in immediate proximity to the Great Tower?‚Äù

Lindsay shrugged. ‚ÄúA bit, probably. I don‚Äôt think the ambient ‚Äònoise,‚Äô if you will, is going to be very noticeable to you even a few days from now. It‚Äôll be miniscule interference. Your apparent rest state, like what you‚Äôre doing now, might vary, but it‚Äôs not really relevant.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs from your outside perspective. For me, the cloud feels tremendously excited and pulled in a thousand different directions.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see. Then only you can answer your question. Moving on‚Ä¶ check your interface for your output level. Bring it up to forty percent, my steely cowboy.‚Äù

In short, they need to get creative. I constantly see players take the world on its terms and get chewed up as a result.

I'm writing this to set down some of the options open to most Edgerunners, so that other people can use them. If you've already done these, and have advice about probable pitfalls, that's great! If you're a GM and you're reading these panicking about how they can mess up your Precious Encounter (TM), well...

[Sorry, not sorry.](https://preview.redd.it/amrks22ztk7f1.png?width=2244&format=png&auto=webp&s=d13ff7f7c556757fc77bfb05958cd860b2d7f0d9)

Let's go with general advice, and then we'll get specific.

# General Advice

**Research the gig first, and then haggle with the fixer.** I'm astounded more players don't do this.

* Much like a home purchase, everything's on the table. You can ask for more pay, for material support, for an ally who has a skill you don't (Netrunner, Nomad, etc.)
* Also, just because the fixer isn't necessarily out to screw you doesn't mean the client won't. Learning more about who's offering the gig and why will help you see problems from further off.

**Avoid rolling the dice if you don't have to.**

* The dice will kill you, and they will keep trying to kill you if they miss the first time.
* Most GM's won't make you roll for things that are a guaranteed success. The best way to help yourself here is to ask the GM what you can do to guarantee a success on an action you take. 

**Spend eddies now to avoid spending blood later**

* More information generally leads to better decision-making; get as much as you can.
* Every trap avoided is a victory; it's the ones you don't see that will fuck you like a twink at a bear convention.

**Only fight the enemy on the enemy's terms if you have no other choice.**

* Only fight on ground you choose - it's a sucker's bet to do it the other way.

**Turn your enemy's strengths into your weapons.**

* If your enemy has retreated to a fortified bunker lair, don't go in after them. Figure out how they're getting air down there and then jam the vents at nightfall. Or throw in a bunch of Blue Glass - anything to screw with them. 

[MiliTech propaganda, but actually useful in this case](https://preview.redd.it/igzo2roevk7f1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=7955bd6f6484fa2eab4ae001d53d80258c8c311e)

# Common Situations

Alright, that's the general stuff out of the way - how do you actually apply it? Well, here are some common situations, and more specific ways to take the advice above and turn it into an actionable plan.

**Get To Someone In A Secure Building**

Most of your targets won't be unarmed people on the sidewalk - they will usually have some kind of defenses and a fortified location from which they conduct their life. Your goal, then, is to get them to leave their defenses. You do this by convincing them you have broken those defenses and they are no longer safe.

Generally, the best way to handle this is to turn their expectations of safety against them. Typically, secure buildings have alarms that will alert the inhabitants to fires, carbon monoxide, and other natural concerns. Get to the building's HVAC intakes (preferably while dressed as either building maintenance or an exterminator) and start pouring in smoke (grenades can work, but for a cheaper option, just get a shitload of vegetable oil, mix it with some 10W-40 in a steel pail, and set it on fire). This should have everyone in the building smelling smoke, which should cause an evacuation.

Your target will either a) flee to an AV (but I'm assuming you're just starting out, so we'll skip this one for now), b) flee to a regular car, or c) stay put. We'll cover option (b) next, but for option (c), once everyone's cleared out of the building, it should be easy enough to locate the target in an empty building. Knock them out, throw them over your shoulder in a fireman's carry, and head outside, yelling that you're going to take the target to the hospital. Covering your face is OK, too; most people will think you're just avoiding the smoke.

**Get To Someone In A Moving Ground Vehicle**

This comes up more often than you'd think. Don't go with a drive by - too messy, too memorable, and it draws the NCPD like flies on honey. Instead, if you have a Nomad, just have them create a traffic jam along the target's route. This involves stopping your car while blocking as many lanes of traffic as possible, and lighting a white smoke candle so it looks like your engine has overheated. If you don't have a Nomad, steal a car and do the same thing. Once traffic gridlocks, it's functionally impossible for your target to get away. Make sure you have access to either bicycles, skateboards, or motorcycles so you don't have the same problem.

Neutralize any trail or lead vehicles by taking a coffee can full of gunpowder and throwing it into the air around the car. Non-dairy creamer will also work. Once you've backed off, throw a road flare at the cloud of flammable material. Neutralize the target's vehicle by using a nail gun to jam the locking mechanism on the doors (speed is vital here). Then douse the car in kerosene and inform the occupants that if you don't get what you want, they all burn to death. Hold up a road flare for dramatic emphasis.

Make sure you either cover your face, or get biosculpting done so that you look like someone you want to frame for a crime.

**Interrogations**

This one is hard. Torture doesn't work and drugs are unreliable. You'll need to convince the target that it is in their best interest to give you what you want. A few options exist for this:

* If they are more afraid of their boss than they are of you, create a paper trail so it looks like the subject is helping you. Then threaten to let them go while you release the ""evidence"" to the press.
* If they are a true believer who won't break no matter what, convince them you already know where the information is that you want, and you're going to get it. Then give them a chance to escape, and follow them. With luck, they'll lead you right to it.
* If they want something you can't give them (eddies, protection, etc.), I recommend lying. Do just enough to convince them you have what they want. Create stacks of ""eddies"" by getting a bunch of screamsheet pages, cutting them down to the size of a eurobill, and then putting an eddy on either end of the stack. Give them the illusion of protection by having a paid gonk try to mug them where you can ""intervene."" Just get the information first, and *then* give them the fake payment. Make sure they don't survive; tactics like this create enemies, and that's not good for your health.

Hopefully, this is helpful. If you want to see more strategies like this in action, I recommend *Burn Notice, Leverage,* or *White Collar,* all of which have clever plays like this you can mine for ideas. They're where I got these ideas, in fact! :)

Good luck!

Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. Nicotine is what‚Äôs called a vasoconstrictor, while nicotine itself is not a carcinogen, it can temporarily narrow your blood vessels, veins, and make them smaller while the nicotine is in your system. The nicotine can also raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what‚Äôs called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

I'm a baal tshuva and transsexual who tried (and failed‚Äîor, they failed me) to be a part of frum communities in Brooklyn. The biggest friction came from being a gay trans man: I didn't ""flaunt"" it but I refused to lie about it or pretend I wasn't if it came up, and I was forced out. I miss the community and the heymish Yiddishkeyt even though it was hostile toward me. I go through waves of keeping vs. rejecting halakha, and there are things about Jewish life that I'm not willing to abandon. And the way I see it, I'm still Jewish even if I never utter another brukha or ""omeyn"" in my life. To make an analogy that may not work: being an ex-Jew seems like being a detransitioner. Detransitioners are arguably still trans because they still have trans experiences and think about gender in a ""trans"" way, and they continue to face the transphobic discrimination even after they stop transition. And, ""trans"" is a label they may disidentify with after deciding to stop.

I wouldn't prescribe this view to other people who are/were Jewish‚Äîjust how I see myself. I'd love to hear how you see yourselves in terms of your cultural and religious identity after leaving, or wanting to leave.

Also, if anyone wants to get coffee in New York, please reach out. I think it's a pretty small group of people who actually understand both the frum world and the desire/necessity to leave; it'd be nice to be friends. I'm 36.",2,1750205473.0,exjew,2,1.0,False

1le2vd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/atrioc/comments/1le2vd2/online_drama_and_stupid_takes_are_optimal_actually/,"Online drama and stupid takes are optimal, actually","Let's think about the Superbowl between Team Green and Team Purple.

  
If Team Green is widely expected to win, and in the first quarter they are up by 21, then the game is boring. Team Green might be playing well, they might be playing the best game of their lives, but nobody cares. Team Purple might drop the ball, and nobody cares, because there isn't really a chance it matters anyways. A Team Green blowout is not fun to watch football.

If the opposite is happening, Team Purple is expected to win and they are winning, this is also bad football. All the same arguments apply, nobody cares how well purple is playing, and nobody cares how bad green is playing. The key here is to internalize that the opposite of ""Green Winning"" is not ""Purple Winning""; it is actually ""too close to call.""

When two perfectly matched teams play, Team Green and Team Purple are equally favored and they are neck-and-neck, that is good football. Imagine watching Team Green drop the ball now. Wow!!! Team Green might have blown it!!! Team Purple might punish them for this mistake! That could have been the decisive moment in the game! But wait!!! Purple missed the response and Green has run it back!!!

That is good football. A game with no clear winner, a game where both sides score some points. A game where both sides have some substance and both sides have flaws. Nobody wants to watch peak performance where the superior team wins, they want to watch a good fight.

  
This is the mechanism by which rage on the internet and on the news is selected. Imagine a news story that said, ""Deliberate scientific effort has reduced mortality on this rare disease by 93%"". BORING, the game is already won in the first sentence. Team scientific effort is clearly winning this game, and that is bad football. Instead, try something like this: ""Scientists are aggressively pushing a new treatment, but three widows are making a stand against"". Oh dang, might be cool. Oh wait! These widows have sued three pharma companies in the past 2 years, they are clearly money-grabbing scammers. Wait woah! The clinical trials had 4 scientists quit with no explanation! Wow wait the autopsy shows tissue damage, but it is unclear if it is related to the case! Wow the pharma company sent a lawyer to talk to a widow, and she took a phone video where she threw her coffee at the lawyer!!! The fact that it isn't a perfectly clear-cut case, the fact that both sides have defects, is specifically why a headline like this will become the flagship case for if you should believe in medical treatment.

We can clearly see that having good and bad points on each side are simply good football. Casts for broken bones are bad football, because hey, holding a broken bone straight is basically uncontested and basically just works and is extremely boring. War crime medical experiments are so clearly wrong and messed up that it is also bad football, the bad team is so clearly bad that who cares. Forced medical treatment of someone who has been hospitalized involuntarily, now that has points on both sides and is excellent football. Any media with the goal of engagement is inherently selecting for something in the middle. It explicitly wants heroes with flaws. The protester standing on a burning car is good football, the protester who is polite with a clean record and a nice family is bad football. News stories and rage content are selected by good football metrics.

  
When you receive hate comments on your videos or podcasts, please remember that the most infuriating takes with just a tiny element of truth to them are good football. The heroes for your cause chosen by a news story are selected not despite their flaws, but because of their flaws. A news story wants a hero-villain where either side can make a good point, because that way the comment section can yell past each other while saying true but incomplete justifications.",3,1750204714.0,atrioc,1,0.8,False

Why would he make getting married to a 14 year old acceptable ever? if she REALLY needed to be taken care of it‚Äôs not like adoption doesn‚Äôt exist.

Why did the church just straight up ignore John Taylor‚Äôs revelation written in his own hand? What‚Äôs the point of revelation if the prophet himself can‚Äôt be trusted?

Why did Joseph smith claim that we can‚Äôt have a say on the morality of slavery? Wouldn‚Äôt the prophet of god have a decent clue as to the morality on that topic?

Why can no one explain why polygamy only goes one way in sealings? Why is it okay for a man to have several partners but not the other way around?

The Kansas City Royals, fresh off a six-game losing streak that could make a monk reach for the Xanax, take on the Texas Rangers, who‚Äôve won four straight and are probably already drafting their World Series parade route. Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a retired umpire on a mission.

**The Moneyline & Spread:**

* **Royals (+2.08)**: Bet on the ‚ÄúK.C. Royals‚Äù to pull off a miracle, or just bet on your favorite local coffee shop to stay open longer.
* **Rangers (-1.76)**: The Rangers are -1.5 run dogs on the spread, but with odds like this, it‚Äôs basically free money if you‚Äôve already had three cups of coffee.

**Total (8 Runs):**  
The Over (1.88) is as tempting as a free hot dog at a baseball game, but the Under (1.94) feels like a bet on a toddler‚Äôs nap schedule‚Äî*you never know*.

**Player Prop to Steal Your Cash (and Soul):**

* **Wyatt Langford (Rangers) > 1.5 Hits**: Langford‚Äôs on a 8-for-6 tear, which is like hitting a home run in a game of Jenga. Take him over the tedious Royals‚Äô pitching staff (-120).

**Final Verdict:**  
The Rangers are -1.5 run favorites, which is about the same as the Royals‚Äô chances of ending this streak without a trade. If Langford goes 3-for-5 with a moonshot, this game might finally be worth the price of a stadium pretzel. Otherwise, it‚Äôs another episode of *The Longest Losing Streak in TV History*.

*Bet responsibly, or don‚Äôt‚Äîthis Royals‚Äô season already has a 100% refund policy.* üé≤‚öæ

1le2n53,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersOfHorror/comments/1le2n53/cherries_in_the_killing_tree/,Cherries in the Killing Tree,"In the woods, not too far from my childhood home, there is a large circular clearing where nothing grows‚Ä¶ save for a single black cherry tree in the very center. The Killing Tree, as it is locally well-known. I should clarify; this is not an obscure name for it in these parts. Nobody, except me, ever ventures out to see it; and if they do, they never dare venture more than once.

Once upon a time, shortly after the founding of our town, a body was discovered lying in the center of the clearing. The victim was never identified. Nobody knew who the body had been, nor even whether they had been a man or a woman. It was barely even a body‚Ä¶ more of a disemboweled torso with chunks of muscle missing. The arms and legs were nowhere to be found, and the head was closer to being a skull than not. On top of all that, the body had been lying there for quite some time and was putrefying.

No suspect was ever apprehended.

After the body had been removed, a sprout had taken root in the center of the clearing. The sprout grew to a tree, and nothing else dared grow near it. No grass, shrubs, flowers, or ferns. There was probably a perfectly logical reason for that. There could‚Äôve been something wrong with the soil, or maybe an issue with the quality of light the area received. Maybe the tree was soaking up all the nutrients that could‚Äôve gone to anything else. Who‚Äôs to say? It didn‚Äôt stop people from concocting their own wild speculations about why the rest of the forest refused to encroach upon the ground near the Killing Tree.

Our small community is on the edge of Garret County. Near as close as you can get to the edge of Maryland, without crossing over into Preston, West Virginia. We‚Äôre rural, is what I‚Äôm saying. And‚Ä¶ a lot of us are more than a tad superstitious. Rumors began to circulate amongst the locals that the tree hadn‚Äôt grown from any seed. Rather, it was the manifested embodiment of the terrible fate the victim had endured before being deposited there. The suffering they had experienced had been so great, it had taken on a life of its own. A tree‚Ä¶ around which nothing could grow.

People report feeling nauseous from even looking at the Killing Tree. Some experience panic attacks and supposedly there has even been one heart attack in the clearing over a decade ago. There are even still rumors of hikers who passed too near to it and mysteriously disappeared, though, none have ever been substantiated. Nonetheless, everyone around here avoids going anywhere near that tree to this day. Everyone, it seems, except me.

I think I was eleven, when I first ventured out to see the Killing Tree. I was the only kid in my school who was brave enough to do so, whilst also living close enough to attempt such a venture. I was young, dumb, and bored; looking for ways to entertain myself. I was also a social outcast and didn‚Äôt fit in with anyone in my peer group. At that age, I was obsessed, it seemed, with the pursuit of scaring myself however and whenever I could. I would peer out my bedroom window at night into the backyard and watch for monsters. I would poke around the many abandoned houses in my neighborhood whenever I thought nobody was looking. At school, I would bore disinterested classmates with tall tales about the Sasquatch that I alone believed lived in the woods outside our town.

I was a seeker of the macabre. Yet, there was one thrill above all others that nobody I knew had ever attempted. Probably, because everyone‚Äôs parents would have beaten them viciously if they found out their child had done what I had dared to do. I certainly know my parents would have.

I‚Äôd hiked into the woods and walked for close to an hour before I found the clearing. I didn‚Äôt know exactly where it was, so I spent a lot of time just walking around aimlessly until I found it. I still think I‚Äôm quite lucky I didn‚Äôt get lost.

Stepping into the clearing, my sneakers left prints in the mud. In the center it sat imposing, gnarly, branches grasping upwards towards the empty sky. It looked ancient and dark and powerful‚Ä¶ just like any other tree in the woods.

I was taken aback by how ordinary the Killing Tree really seemed to be. I‚Äôll admit, I was a tad disappointed. I had been hoping to find something which would disturb me, odd as that sounds. Not only was this tree seemingly un-special, it was also easier to climb than most other trees, which made it all the friendlier in my child mind. It felt like common sense that a perfect climbing tree could hold no malice.

I returned to it often and would climb it each time and swing from its branches. In the summers, I would pick the wild black cherries from and partake in them to my stomach‚Äôs content. Even when I grew older past my desires to climb the Killing Tree, I frequented it often as a place of respite from the world. Years went by and the tree was a place of comfort to me. A dark little sanctuary where I could go to escape my continual feelings of disappointment towards others. And though I heard folks mention it from time to time, never once did I ever see another person there.

In time, my social maladjustments gave way, and I formed a small but tight-knit friend group. We did most things together, but never once did I ever take any of them to the Killing Tree with me. I never even offered. It was my special place, and I couldn‚Äôt imagine sharing it with anyone else. I‚Äôd yet to be in love though.

I met my wife, Maddison, at a graduation party when we were both eighteen. We‚Äôd been drinking at someone‚Äôs house and stayed up talking past everyone else passing out or leaving for another party. For some reason, she liked me. More surprisingly, she still liked me the next morning when we woke up together. She‚Äôs beautiful. Brunette, eyes that glow the color of the sky on a cloudy day and a smile that could outshine the sun. For lack of a better word, she‚Äôs radiant. Everyone around her saw it. She always walked through life like she was dancing as well. I was head-over-heels for her the second I woke up to her beaming smile.

We started dating shortly after that night. I got my first job, partially just so I‚Äôd have money to be able to spend on things we could do together. Maddison became my world, and I think I had become hers as well. We did everything together. We went to parties, took day-long road trips, went on walks and more. On nights we weren‚Äôt together, we‚Äôd stay up late talking on the phone and would fall asleep without hanging up. Eventually we got our first place together: a tiny apartment that cozily kept us in proximity with each other. Even still, there was one place I had never taken her.

I had told Maddison I frequented the Killing Tree on my own, but she never went with me. She didn‚Äôt even believe me at first, suspecting I was bullshitting about going there to sound cool or to impress her.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I told her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious. It‚Äôs my safe place.‚Äù

Maddison had paused for a bit before giggling and playfully bumping into me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre weird! You‚Äôd better not bring anything negative home with you!‚Äù

I laughed it off, but secretly I was a little disappointed. Part of me had been hoping that she would want to go there with me, and I could finally share my favorite place with someone. It was okay though; my second favorite place was a two-room apartment with the woman I loved.

After almost two years of living together, I had decided the time had come to pop the question. We were 22, and I‚Äôd saved up enough money to buy the perfect engagement ring. The band was made of three beautifully braided strips of white gold. On either side of the diamond were two rectangular cut pieces of dark-blue tourmaline that matched the color of her eyes.

I had proposed on our three-year anniversary, and we married a few months later in October. It was an outdoor wedding, and the crisp-fall air wafted orange and yellow leaves through our ceremony. Maybe we were too young at the time; we were still living in a small apartment barely scraping by. It didn‚Äôt feel like it mattered, we were all we needed. As she walked the aisle, I remember thinking how stunning she looked in her white dress. It was as if I were seeing her again for the first time. Nobody else could take their eyes off her either. Maddison‚Äôs radiance was more pronounced than ever.

Months went by into our new life, and the honeymoon phase began. Our families sent us on a two-week trip to New York City. I think that was the happiest I ever felt‚Ä¶ I would give anything to re-live those two weeks again for the rest of my life. Maybe not the trip itself, just the feelings we shared together during it. The cruel reality of experiencing one‚Äôs happiest days is contending in a world wherein you know you will never have them again.

We returned home from half a month of shopping and eating and sightseeing, and lovemaking, to a two-room apartment. Life resumed, as did its responsibilities. We both went back to our respective jobs, looking forward to coming home in the evenings and enjoying each other‚Äôs company.

I started returning to the Killing Tree again. I‚Äôd forgotten how much I‚Äôd missed it and the peace it brought me. However, something unexpected happened. A few months after our honeymoon, Maddison asked if she could go with me.

I was thrilled to be sharing the experience of the tree with my wife. I wasn‚Äôt really sure why she‚Äôd had a change of heart, but I didn‚Äôt question it either. I told her she was absolutely welcome to accompany me and agreed to take her along the next time I went.

It was a few days later when we both had off together. We set out shortly after midday, drove to a parking lot which was within walking distance of the tree. I took the lead.

It started out as a jovial experience, though, I could sense that Maddison was a little anxious. No doubt, still hung up on the stories and legends she had grown up hearing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be fine! You‚Äôll like it!‚Äù I reassured her, nearly stumbling over a root thereafter. She laughed, but I could hear discomfort in it.

When we were almost at the tree, Maddison stopped with her arms crossed.

‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù I asked her.

‚ÄúI want to go back‚Ä¶‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúSweetie, I don‚Äôt-‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm serious. I don‚Äôt want to be out here.‚Äù Maddison‚Äôs face was pale, and her eyes locked to mine.

It was still hours away from being dark, and we were only a minute‚Äôs walk from the clearing. ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ well, you can wait here? I‚Äôll be right back. It‚Äôs just up ahead.‚Äù

‚ÄúStop!‚Äù Her voice had a crack in it. ‚ÄúI want to go back!‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt going to waste the trip. It was halfway through summer, and the Killing Tree would be lush with cherries. We had already come so far, and I really didn‚Äôt want to walk her back to the car, drive her home, then come back to do the hike over. I‚Äôll admit, I was annoyed with her, and it crept into my voice. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs right up here! I‚Äôm walking up to see it.‚Äù There‚Äôs nothing to be afraid of, I promise.‚Äù

Maddison remained silent, looking at the ground.

I sweetened my voice to the best of my ability. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll only be a minute.‚Äù I did feel bad and knew I was being selfish in expecting her to go with me, but I also felt a bit as though she was being selfish in a way by asking to come along, only to ask to go back at the last minute. I attempted to justify my choice to keep going by telling myself that if she wanted to go back, she easily could. In the back of my mind though, I knew that wasn‚Äôt true. Maddison had no chance of navigating out of the woods on her own. She didn‚Äôt really have any choice other than to follow me.

As we stepped into the clearing, I felt an intense warmth fill my chest. It was as if a wave of rejuvenating positivity had washed over my soul and put my mind at peace. I walked up to the old cherry tree and plucked a few of the ripe dark bulbs from its branches, before popping one into my mouth. ‚ÄúMmmmh!‚Äù I savored the ripe flesh, before spitting the pit on the ground. ‚ÄúMaddison! You should try one!‚Äù

Maddison was staring at the tree with her eyes wide, visibly shaking.

‚ÄúMaddison? It‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs just a tree like any other.‚Äù

‚ÄúTake me back.‚Äù She begged.

‚ÄúSeriously! Try one!‚Äù I held one of the cherries out as I approached her.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! I don‚Äôt want one!‚Äù She visibly recoiled as I approached her.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay! They‚Äôre just like any other cherry!‚Äù I held it out to her so she could see.

‚ÄúSTOP!‚Äù She screamed as tears ran down her cheeks. She slapped my hand away and tripped backwards into the mud sobbing. ‚ÄúPlease! Please take me home!‚Äù

I felt my blood boil upon having the cherries knocked from my hand. Still, I forced myself to take a step back and recollect myself. I was angry that my wife had brought a feeling of negativity into the special place I had shared with her. No doubt, I would be thinking about this incident the next time I visited the clearing. Still, I supposed it wasn‚Äôt her fault. Nobody else was able to truly see the beauty of the Killing Tree. I shouldn‚Äôt have expected her to be any different.

‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù I helped her up to her feet and led her back through the forest by her arm. She didn‚Äôt say anything on the way back to the car, nor on the drive home. She just stared off into the distance in a daze. Whenever I tried to make conversation with her, she would look anywhere but at me.

We got home and she went straight to the shower. That night, in bed, neither of us said a word.

In the week that followed, she slowly opened back up to me. I apologized to her, bought her flowers and candy, made dinner one night and rented a movie for us to watch. Things slowly went back to a facsimile of how they had been. It wasn‚Äôt completely the same though. Something had changed between us. Nothing major, but it was like something in our relationship had changed. It was like we had both been made acutely aware of the fact that we didn‚Äôt completely get along on everything.

This realization began to manifest itself in small ways throughout our life together. I would leave a light on while leaving the room, and she would get petty for an hour. I‚Äôd vacuum when she wasn‚Äôt doing anything, only for her to roll her eyes and storm out of the apartment in a huff until I was done. I brought gifts home less and less and didn‚Äôt ask her what she wanted for dinner as often. It wasn‚Äôt like that all the time between us. Not even most of the time. We were still in love and still burning strong for each other. But we fought now, which was something we had never really done before.

The fighting got more intense with the passage of time. Many days, it seemed like Maddison would find reasons to be upset with me. She would start fights with me over the apartment being messy when she found a single surface with dust on it. She started seeming less impressed with the gifts I would give her. She spent less and less time around me and would go out more often during the nights with her friends. I didn‚Äôt have friends‚Ä¶ I was losing my only source of social interaction.

We started fighting about finances as well. I knew Maddison wanted kids. She had been an only child and had always made it clear she wanted children of her own someday. I did too, but we couldn‚Äôt afford it. I was looking for better work but had no luck finding any. Maddison watched her friends and piers move on with their lives, as her husband floundered and struggled to achieve more.

One night, just before our third marriage anniversary, Maddison was going through the mail and sighed.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up sweetie?‚Äù I asked her.

‚ÄúBank account.‚Äù She held up the paper from across the room. ‚ÄúWe really don‚Äôt have any savings.‚Äù

We were both working full time, but neither of us made more than a few bucks over minimum wage. Still, it‚Äôd felt like what she‚Äôd said had held accusatory connotations. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry sweetie. I‚Äôm doing my best.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you are.‚Äù She said flatly.¬† I felt my face start to heat with embarrassment and shame. Maybe rage.

‚ÄúI am! I‚Äôm doing everything I can to find more work!‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you are.‚Äù She spoke.

‚ÄúI just haven‚Äôt been successful!‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you haven‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù I stood up. ‚ÄúJust get it out.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm not bringing in enough money! I‚Äôm going to find good work! We‚Äôll get some more money under our belt and figure things out.‚Äù I really was trying. Trying and struggling.

Maddison didn‚Äôt say much. She just looked around our apartment somberly. ‚ÄúYou know Kenny bought a house recently?‚Äù

I was taken aback by this. Kenny was one of her coworkers. ‚ÄúOf course, Kenny bought a house‚Ä¶ He was in the Marines.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was never in any fights!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter! He still would‚Äôve qualified for the GI bill!‚Äù I paced back and forth and shook my head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know Maddison, maybe you should‚Äôve married a vet or something.‚Äù I jabbed.

Maddison said nothing. She said nothing for a painfully long time. I felt something inside me rip.

‚ÄúSweetie?‚Äù

She shook her head, as though snapping out of a daydream. ‚ÄúSorry. I love you.‚Äù She hugged me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. We‚Äôre okay. Work will come, okay? I believe in you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love you too.‚Äù I said, trying to push down the feeling of betrayal. Whether it had been justified or imagined, it tortured me all the same.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to bed. Are you coming?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúEventually. I need to clear my head, first.‚Äù

That night, after Maddison went to bed, I went back to the Killing Tree. I had never gone at night. I was always too afraid of venturing into the woods after sundown. But then, I was 25. I knew that patch of forest like the back of my hand. On top of that, I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to sleep worth shit after that conversation. I was off work the next day, so I saw no harm in going out late.

Everything around me was lit up beneath the light of a mostly full moon. The forest was much different at night. Everything I was familiar with had a new sense of danger to it as I treaded lightly through the leaves and underbrush. I thought back to my childhood desire to be scared, which had driven me to seek out the Killing Tree to begin with. Now, on the other side of a world I knew so intimately, I felt myself reconnecting with that sense of macabre fascination once more.

As I entered the clearing, I sat beneath the Killing Tree and slumped against it. I punched the dirt, not really sure if I wanted scream or not. I knew in some way, Maddison was right. I knew I was failing to give us both a better life for ourselves. Our friends went off to college or the military or trade school or climbed their own corporate ladders. I felt stuck. I was failing the woman I loved. Worse than that, I was aware that she knew I was failing.

Something thudded near my foot, and I looked down. A cherry had fallen from the Killing Tree. I chuckled. Whenever I needed this place, it was here for me. I popped the fruit into my mouth and spat out the pit to my side. I could feel my eyes growing heavy, but I didn‚Äôt have the strength to make myself get up. Instead, I drifted into unconsciousness, wrapped in the atmospheric blanket of the clearing.

When I awoke the next morning, it was already almost noon. My phone was filled with texts from my wife.

*<Where are you?> <Are you okay?> <You‚Äôd better be okay> <I‚Äôm so fucking pissed right now> <Seriously, where are you!?>*

I sped home as fast as I could. Maddison was at work, and I started panicking. I hadn‚Äôt intended to fall asleep; it just sort of happened. I texted her back.¬†*<I‚Äôm so sorry. I went to visit the clearing last night and fell asleep while there. I‚Äôm fine. I have dinner on for when you get home.>*¬†After thinking for a second, I sent one more text.¬†*<Love you.>*

She left me on read.

That night, when Maddison got home, she walked right past me without saying anything.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry about last night.‚Äù I could feel the anger radiating off her. ‚ÄúI made spaghetti and meatballs! Remember when I made spaghetti and meatballs the first time I ever cooked for you? And you described it as the ‚Äòspaghettiest‚Äô spaghetti you had ever tasted? That was wild.‚Äù I was hoping that I could warm through her icy demeanor. ‚ÄúYou know, I was thinking about what we could watch tonight-‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this.‚Äù She cut me off. The pain in my chest I had felt the night before came back tenfold. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stay here tonight. Or for a while. I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù My wife looked at me with tears in her eyes. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be around you right now.‚Äù

My vision blurred as something warm streaks ran from my eyes down my cheeks. ‚ÄúI- I don‚Äôt understand?‚Äù I stepped towards her, and she stepped back. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

She shook her head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so smart. I think you do.‚Äù

‚ÄúI-‚Äù I was at a loss for words as my world shattered. ‚ÄúI thought- You said you loved me last night!?‚Äù

‚ÄúI do. I Just can‚Äôt live like this. Not forever. At least, not for right now. And we married so young, and-‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you regret marrying me?!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! I-‚Äù Maddison rubbed her eyes and stood up as straight as she could. ‚ÄúI need to go.‚Äù

I watched as she went into the bedroom, shoved a few days‚Äô worth of clothes into a plastic bag, and left. It was just me, in a little apartment that felt way too big now that I was alone.

I texted her all throughout the next day. She never read any of them. I called her phone a few times but always got sent straight to voicemail. At work I felt sick and miserable. When I was off, I went to the Killing Tree almost daily, just to give myself something to do. I couldn‚Äôt stand to be in our apartment. Her things were suffocating to be around.

One day, I came home to discover the rest of her clothes were missing from our dresser. Several other things of hers were also gone from the apartment. She had come back when I was away and taken more of her stuff. This felt like it tore me open even further. It was a pain unlike anything I‚Äôd ever thought myself capable of experiencing. That pain turned to anger. We were supposed to be partners We both promised ‚Äòtil death do us part‚Äô.

My anger grew more and more bitter. Daily, I hoped she would reach out to me so we could talk things through. However, despite wanting to talk to her so much, there was a piece of me that fantasized endlessly about rudely crushing her if she did. I imagined her approaching me out of the blue, telling me she had made a mistake and wanted to be part of my life again; only so I could tell her to fuck off and see the spark extinguish from her eyes. Deep down, I knew I didn‚Äôt want to hurt her; I just wanted the emotional catharsis of her understanding and experiencing the pain I was feeling.

My rage reached a tipping point one night, when I got drunk and angrily sent her two messages in a fit of petulant rage.¬†*<I wish I never slept with you at the graduation party.> <Delete your photos of me. You don‚Äôt deserve to have those memories.>*

I cracked open another hard cider, laughing to myself at the pain I imagined the texts caused her. Five minutes later, my phone buzzed in my pocket and my heart skipped a beat when I read it.

*<I‚Äôd like to talk to you at some point when your available>*

Serotonin lit up my brain at the excitement of being able to talk to her again. Only now, I wasn‚Äôt angry. I was hopeful and ecstatic.¬†*<Where and when?>*

*<Tomorrow evening. Our place.>*

*<Sure>*¬†My heart raced at the thought of seeing her face again so soon. Not only that, but she referred to it as¬†***our***¬†place!¬†*‚ÄòShe must still see us living together!‚Äô,*¬†I thought gleefully. I found myself typing a little bit more.¬†*<I‚Äôve missed you!>*

I took off work the next day so I could get everything ready for Maddison‚Äôs arrival. I washed the dishes, vacuumed, dusted, threw out the empty cans and bottles that had accumulated around my bed, etc. I didn‚Äôt know what time she had planned on coming over, but I was guessing it wouldn‚Äôt be too late in the evening.

When I heard the knock at the door, it was close to 7:30 pm. I gulped back my anxiety, as I worked up the courage to open it.

Maddison looked as radiant as ever. Her hair was messy and unkempt. She was wearing grey hoodie and sweatpants. She wasn‚Äôt wearing any makeup. She was herself, as I alone knew her to be. I felt like I was seeing her again for the first time!

‚ÄúCome in!‚Äù I insisted. ‚ÄúAre you okay? How was your day?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. It was good. Let‚Äôs sit down.‚Äù

Maddison sat down on the couch. I sat next to her; not too close, but still a little hurt when she scooted further down from me.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs up?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúYou wanted to talk?‚Äù

Maddison eyed me up and down from two cushions away, unblinking and expressionless. ‚ÄúYou regret sleeping with me?‚Äù

I was taken aback. ‚ÄúI- I was- see, I was drinking last night, okay? I was frustrated and-‚Äù

‚ÄúI regret sleeping with you.‚Äù

I felt what little of my heart remained shattering inside my chest. My breathing got heavy, and I turned away from her so she couldn‚Äôt directly see my eyes go misty. ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù I managed to squeak out.

‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù Maddison said. I could hear the pain in her own voice as well.

‚ÄúIf you love me, why are you doing this?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI love you, but this is weird. You‚Äôve been acting weird for a long time and I don‚Äôt feel comfortable here anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about!‚Äù

‚ÄúReally!? The fucking ways you‚Äôve been acting manipulative towards me for months?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been acting manipulative?? You fucking left!‚Äù

‚ÄúTyler, you‚Äôve been playing fucking mind-games with me, and I hate it! You get weird when I hang out with my friends in the evenings! You over-misinterpret things I say as me starting fights! You spam messages at me whenever I don‚Äôt respond to you about anything and it‚Äôs weird!‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt understand what the fuck she was talking about or why she was trying to throw her actions back on me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about not coming home when I did. I just-‚Äù

‚ÄúTHE TREE IS NOT THE FUCKING PROBLEM, TYLER!!!‚Äù Maddison was practically shouting. ‚ÄúYou act like you‚Äôre fucking entitled to me, and I don‚Äôt know why you don‚Äôt see it!‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I don‚Äôt act like that!‚Äù I decided to try a different tactic. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bringing in more money!‚Äù I lied. ‚ÄúI just got offered a raise!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about money either. You‚Äôre not good for me. I can‚Äôt live the rest of my life like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have more to offer than before you left.‚Äù

She slid closer to me and her hand rested on mine. I pulled my arm away out of anger and immediately wished I could feel her hand again. That was probably going to be the last time I ever felt the love of my life‚Äôs hand.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll change.‚Äù I whimpered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be better. I‚Äôll find work. I‚Äôll give you the life you deserve.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou just said you got a raise.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll find better work. Much better.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about the life¬†*you*¬†deserve?‚Äù She asked. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not thinking about yourself, only me. This isn‚Äôt healthy! You can‚Äôt only force yourself to find something better on someone else‚Äôs behalf! And it‚Äôs not fair for you to live for someone YOU think expects you to be different.‚Äù Maddison stood up. ‚ÄúI want you to be happy. I want to be happy. This isn‚Äôt working out. You changed after we got married. It‚Äôs like you felt like you locked me in and the real you started coming out.‚Äù

I still didn‚Äôt know what she was on about. ‚ÄúYou want a divorce?‚Äù

‚ÄúEventually. When we can both handle it.‚Äù She walked in front of me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to sit in a divorce court now. I don‚Äôt think you do either. Right now, we just need to learn to exist away from each other. It‚Äôs for the best, I promise.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to live without you!‚Äù I was raising my voice now.

‚ÄúTyler, I need you to listen to me‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt live without you!‚Äù I screamed.

Maddison backed away slowly. ‚ÄúYes. You can‚Ä¶ You¬†*have*¬†been. You‚Äôre strong. You‚Äôre a smart person. But Tyler, this isn‚Äôt healthy‚Ä¶ Please try to understand.‚Äù She was backing towards the door.

‚ÄúWait!‚Äù I stood up. This was my last chance to convince her to stay. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go! Please!‚Äù I grabbed her wrist and tried to pull her back to me.

‚ÄúLet go!‚Äù Maddison struggled against my grasp. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this! Stop!‚Äù

Maddison tried pulling the door open. I pushed it shut with my free hand. ‚ÄúPlease just listen! I can‚Äôt say goodbye to you again!‚Äù

‚ÄúTyler! Let me the fuck go!‚Äù There was a loud clap, and I felt my face start to sting. Maddison and I both looked at each other shocked for a second, unsure if it had really happened, before she slapped me a second time. Then a third. ‚ÄúLet go! Don‚Äôt touch me! Let go! Let go! LET GO!!!‚Äù

My memory starts blurs here a bit, so I‚Äôll do my best to describe what happened next: I pulled Maddison away from the door with all my might, swung her around, and shoved her towards the coffee table. She stumbled across it, fell back and landed on her neck. She cried out as her limbs flailed and she tried to reorient herself. I didn‚Äôt give her the opportunity, closing the distance between her and I before grabbing her by the hair and slamming the back of her head into the floor. She stopped screaming, immediately dazed by what had happened. I had no intention of giving her the opportunity to resume, slamming her head once more before straddling her chest and beginning to rain blows upon her face.

This is where my memory completely fogs over. I don‚Äôt know how many times I punched her or for how long. I don‚Äôt remember when her begging faded into distorted gurgles, or when her body went limp. I just remember sitting over her‚Ä¶ My hand was the color of an unpainted brick wall. My entire body burned an icy cold. I stared straight ahead for what felt like an hour, before forcing myself to look down.

Maddison had no face. If one were to closely examine the pulverized fleshy mass, they might faintly recognize the distorted features of what had once been somebody‚Äôs only child.

I screamed. I ran to one of the drawers in the kitchen space and pulled out a large knife that I used to slice my arm open. I was trying my hardest to awaken from a nightmare I knew wasn‚Äôt the case. My blood pooled across the floor, and that combined with what I had done sent me into a shock which lasted for hours.

I sat next to Maddison, shaking and wishing the self-inflicted wound on my arm had been enough to kill me. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to look at her directly. I didn‚Äôt want to see what I had done to her face. Even still, I could very clearly see her legs sprawled out on the floor in front of me as I stared off into the distance.

Eventually, light shone through the window as day broke. I didn‚Äôt bother calling out of work again. I just stayed home with Maddison. I wasn‚Äôt hungry. I wasn‚Äôt tired. I didn‚Äôt even need to use the bathroom all day. I just sat on the floor next to her, doing my best not to look at her directly.

There were flies on Maddison.

After half a day of sitting with her, the shock of what had happened started wearing off. I cried. I bawled my eyes out. I had murdered my whole world, the only woman I would ever love, and life had no reason to continue. Yet, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to end it all. I think I deserved to die, but I couldn‚Äôt work up the courage to attempt it. I knew Maddison wouldn‚Äôt have wanted that for me. Even through everything, she had always loved me; she wouldn‚Äôt have wanted me to throw my life away alongside hers.

I realized it was only a matter of time before someone came to check in here and discovered what I had done. I decided that I needed to move her out of our apartment. To do that, I needed to reduce her weight and mass. The thought of intentionally damaging Maddison made me puke my empty stomach into the sink. I couldn‚Äôt leave her where she was though. ¬†

I took the kitchen knife I had used to slice my arm the night prior. Approaching Maddison‚Äôs body, I crouched next to her and closed my eyes. Clenched my teeth and put my hand on her cold, stiff chest. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù

I began to disassemble Maddison.

I put her limbs into a trash bag, along with all the trash which I hadn‚Äôt taken out in a week. At a glance, you couldn‚Äôt even tell that the bag contained Maddison‚Äôs severed appendages. I took the trash out to the dumpster in the parking lot, making sure to remove a few of the bags already in there and put them on top of my contribution. I had ensured that the first half of her would likely never be found, now I had to handle the second half.

I didn‚Äôt want to just throw Maddison‚Äôs torso and what remained of her head away. I felt like her heart and mind, the parts of her which most made up who she had been, deserved to be taken somewhere nice. Somewhere beautiful and quiet, where I can visit her still in the future. I couldn‚Äôt give her a proper burial or a grave-marker, but I could return her to nature. If say, her body were to feed something greater, would she not in some way live on?

I stuffed Maddison‚Äôs into a luggage bag and rolled her into my car. I put the case in the passenger seat, made sure it was buckled in nicely for her, and drove to the parking lot closest to the clearing. Nobody was around when I‚Äôd gotten there. Nobody saw me pull the luggage bag out of the passenger seat, extend the handle, and set off with it into the woods.

The forest was dead silent the entire walk. There were no evening birds chirping or squirrels chasing one another throughout the leaves. The wind lay dormant. The only sound amongst the trees, beneath the encroaching twilight, was me walking with the woman I loved.

When the clearing came into sight, I felt tears well up within my eyes. My chest constricted, and I felt the melancholic acceptance one feels upon the realization that a chapter in their life is forever over. My marriage to Maddison ended that day. She left me, returned, announced she‚Äôd wanted a divorce, then left again. She went missing. The police would inevitably check in, but I had no idea where she had gone. I love her, still. Completely and unconditionally, that will never change. I still feel angry though. My body still burns with the fire of her betrayal.

I leaned the bag against the Killing Tree, slowly unzipped it and gently pulled Maddison into my arms. Before I laid her to the dirt beside the gnarled cherry, I wanted to hold her one last time. It wasn‚Äôt the same. Maddison was cold and distant. I gently stroked her hair away from the pulp her eyes stared up at me through. Even though I loved her with all my heart, part of me hated her for abjuring her vows. She promised at the altar. I felt taken advantage of for believing her.

I laid her down and sat next to her one last time. My mind raced back to when Maddison had come here with me, and it caused that first fight almost a year prior. I did wish she would‚Äôve liked her final resting place more whilst alive.

Flies had already found their way to her, as quickly as mosquitoes had set upon me. Sunset had fallen now, and I stared up at the quickly darkening sky above. Or at least, what I could see of it through the branches and the leaves. Among them, the black cherries I had enjoyed for what felt like my whole life. Few things remain consistent. Someday, perhaps in my lifetime, the Killing Tree would die as well. Someday. But for the time being, I closed my eyes and drifted off to sleep once again. A deep sleep with dreams of cherries and a small apartment‚Ä¶ and eyes.

We say hello or wave when we first see each other but that's it. We often make small talk when we first meet in the morning. It's only in the past few months he started talking to me before if we were in the same room or lift there would be silence.

There are times he doesn't say hello at all. I often say hello and he doesn't answer. Perhaps he's stressed out. A lot of people think he's rude. I thought that too but as I have gotten to know him I think he needs time to warm to people.

Sometimes he helps me out with tasks that are completely unrelated to his job. We're in totally different areas. He has often carried heavy items for me or let me out a door first. He asked me if I needed help one day and insisted on carrying a bag even though I told him it's too heavy.

He asks the most random questions about my tasks and what I'm using or doing and I know he has absolutely no interest in knowing the answers. I never really noticed him before but lately I have a crush on him and I think he knows. He caught me looking at him a few times. He often looks at me each time he walks by in the canteen when he gets his coffee or when I'm standing around chatting to others. I think he wants to see if I am looking at him. It's just me he looks at nobody else.

One part of my job is collecting items from certain areas first thing in the morning and these areas are places he works so he's often coming in behind me. One morning he said ""I'm not stalking you saying my name. I didn't know he even knew my name. We were together in the lift one day as the door was about to close he pushed it open we made eye contact but he just continued to look at his phone and he nodded goodbye as he left. He sometimes nods hello too.

I bumped into him after work at the supermarket recently he was in the queue behind me and he awkwardly said hello but I initiated it. He looked very nervous. He looks at me when he sees me and I think he's unsure whether to say hello or not. It's a slight side eye look. He looks at me from other rooms I can see him through the windows.

He doesn't make much eye contact but we have locked eyes occasionally. I've also caught him looking at me from a distance but up close he seldom makes eye contact especially when we chat. We briefly chatted recently and as he was leaving he looked back at me. He tends to look to the side when we talk and sometimes he has a slight smile on his face.

I just don't know. Is he trying to be nice or does he like me? Or am I making him uncomfortable? I have no idea if he's married or in a relationship. The job we both work in is a sterile environment and no jewelry or rings are permitted.

To show how ridiculous this is, the estate total value is approximately $6,000. Total. Since it was so small there is no will. 

This sibling has always been nasty and vindictive and couldn't wait to begin making demands for the little bit that is in the estate and creating emotional and financial havoc. This individual wants complete control of literally every object in the deceased sibling's home, wants the major assets  took a long list of items for themselves, and also demands complete and sole access and control of all documents and online accounts. 

Fine. We decided to let them have it all with the exception of a few sentimental items (with no monetary value). And even that isn't good enough! This nasty piece of work is refusing to allow others to have even small mementos like a coffee mug, baseball cap, framed photo, etc.  

This sibling has even refused to accept anyone's disclaimers for the estate assets and instead is demanding to retain and review every piece of paper, every document, every item, INCLUDING THE DECEASED'S pencil sketches with an attorney present! These demands are delivered with vindictiveness, anger and intent to be demeaning.  

Yet they do NOT want to be the personal representative! They want all the monetary assets, all the sentimental items AND refuse to allow anyone else so much as a coffee mug, while running up attorney's fees for those seeking a simple memento or two. 

The most unbelievable thing is that my beloved deceased sibling and I come from the same family as this despicable and pathetic excuse for a human being. 

Wondering if others have/are dealing with similar issues. It is no surprise that estate issues are one of the major causes of rifts in families. In this case, the sooner we are rid of this evil seed from our lives the better off we are. 

While I fully understand grief brings anger, this individual has been evil and nasty their whole life and continues to be that way even though they are now in their ""senior"" years. 

Please send any good energy my way. Trying to be honorable, reasonable and open has meant nothing. I send thoughts to my loved one and hope for their intervention to do what they can to cease this torture inflicted by this demon seed.

1le2jv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1le2jv0/cherries_in_the_killing_tree/,Cherries in the Killing Tree,"In the woods, not too far from my childhood home, there is a large circular clearing where nothing grows‚Ä¶ save for a single black cherry tree in the very center. The Killing Tree, as it is locally well-known. I should clarify; this is not an obscure name for it in these parts. Nobody, except me, ever ventures out to see it; and if they do, they never dare venture more than once.

Once upon a time, shortly after the founding of our town, a body was discovered lying in the center of the clearing. The victim was never identified. Nobody knew who the body had been, nor even whether they had been a man or a woman. It was barely even a body‚Ä¶ more of a disemboweled torso with chunks of muscle missing. The arms and legs were nowhere to be found, and the head was closer to being a skull than not. On top of all that, the body had been lying there for quite some time and was putrefying.

No suspect was ever apprehended.

After the body had been removed, a sprout had taken root in the center of the clearing. The sprout grew to a tree, and nothing else dared grow near it. No grass, shrubs, flowers, or ferns. There was probably a perfectly logical reason for that. There could‚Äôve been something wrong with the soil, or maybe an issue with the quality of light the area received. Maybe the tree was soaking up all the nutrients that could‚Äôve gone to anything else. Who‚Äôs to say? It didn‚Äôt stop people from concocting their own wild speculations about why the rest of the forest refused to encroach upon the ground near the Killing Tree.

Our small community is on the edge of Garret County. Near as close as you can get to the edge of Maryland, without crossing over into Preston, West Virginia. We‚Äôre rural, is what I‚Äôm saying. And‚Ä¶ a lot of us are more than a tad superstitious. Rumors began to circulate amongst the locals that the tree hadn‚Äôt grown from any seed. Rather, it was the manifested embodiment of the terrible fate the victim had endured before being deposited there. The suffering they had experienced had been so great, it had taken on a life of its own. A tree‚Ä¶ around which nothing could grow.

People report feeling nauseous from even looking at the Killing Tree. Some experience panic attacks and supposedly there has even been one heart attack in the clearing over a decade ago. There are even still rumors of hikers who passed too near to it and mysteriously disappeared, though, none have ever been substantiated. Nonetheless, everyone around here avoids going anywhere near that tree to this day. Everyone, it seems, except me.

I think I was eleven, when I first ventured out to see the Killing Tree. I was the only kid in my school who was brave enough to do so, whilst also living close enough to attempt such a venture. I was young, dumb, and bored; looking for ways to entertain myself. I was also a social outcast and didn‚Äôt fit in with anyone in my peer group. At that age, I was obsessed, it seemed, with the pursuit of scaring myself however and whenever I could. I would peer out my bedroom window at night into the backyard and watch for monsters. I would poke around the many abandoned houses in my neighborhood whenever I thought nobody was looking. At school, I would bore disinterested classmates with tall tales about the Sasquatch that I alone believed lived in the woods outside our town.

I was a seeker of the macabre. Yet, there was one thrill above all others that nobody I knew had ever attempted. Probably, because everyone‚Äôs parents would have beaten them viciously if they found out their child had done what I had dared to do. I certainly know my parents would have.

I‚Äôd hiked into the woods and walked for close to an hour before I found the clearing. I didn‚Äôt know exactly where it was, so I spent a lot of time just walking around aimlessly until I found it. I still think I‚Äôm quite lucky I didn‚Äôt get lost.

Stepping into the clearing, my sneakers left prints in the mud. In the center it sat imposing, gnarly, branches grasping upwards towards the empty sky. It looked ancient and dark and powerful‚Ä¶ just like any other tree in the woods.

I was taken aback by how ordinary the Killing Tree really seemed to be. I‚Äôll admit, I was a tad disappointed. I had been hoping to find something which would disturb me, odd as that sounds. Not only was this tree seemingly un-special, it was also easier to climb than most other trees, which made it all the friendlier in my child mind. It felt like common sense that a perfect climbing tree could hold no malice.

I returned to it often and would climb it each time and swing from its branches. In the summers, I would pick the wild black cherries from and partake in them to my stomach‚Äôs content. Even when I grew older past my desires to climb the Killing Tree, I frequented it often as a place of respite from the world. Years went by and the tree was a place of comfort to me. A dark little sanctuary where I could go to escape my continual feelings of disappointment towards others. And though I heard folks mention it from time to time, never once did I ever see another person there.

In time, my social maladjustments gave way, and I formed a small but tight-knit friend group. We did most things together, but never once did I ever take any of them to the Killing Tree with me. I never even offered. It was my special place, and I couldn‚Äôt imagine sharing it with anyone else. I‚Äôd yet to be in love though.

I met my wife, Maddison, at a graduation party when we were both eighteen. We‚Äôd been drinking at someone‚Äôs house and stayed up talking past everyone else passing out or leaving for another party. For some reason, she liked me. More surprisingly, she still liked me the next morning when we woke up together. She‚Äôs beautiful. Brunette, eyes that glow the color of the sky on a cloudy day and a smile that could outshine the sun. For lack of a better word, she‚Äôs radiant. Everyone around her saw it. She always walked through life like she was dancing as well. I was head-over-heels for her the second I woke up to her beaming smile.

We started dating shortly after that night. I got my first job, partially just so I‚Äôd have money to be able to spend on things we could do together. Maddison became my world, and I think I had become hers as well. We did everything together. We went to parties, took day-long road trips, went on walks and more. On nights we weren‚Äôt together, we‚Äôd stay up late talking on the phone and would fall asleep without hanging up. Eventually we got our first place together: a tiny apartment that cozily kept us in proximity with each other. Even still, there was one place I had never taken her.

I had told Maddison I frequented the Killing Tree on my own, but she never went with me. She didn‚Äôt even believe me at first, suspecting I was bullshitting about going there to sound cool or to impress her.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I told her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious. It‚Äôs my safe place.‚Äù

Maddison had paused for a bit before giggling and playfully bumping into me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre weird! You‚Äôd better not bring anything negative home with you!‚Äù

I laughed it off, but secretly I was a little disappointed. Part of me had been hoping that she would want to go there with me, and I could finally share my favorite place with someone. It was okay though; my second favorite place was a two-room apartment with the woman I loved.

After almost two years of living together, I had decided the time had come to pop the question. We were 22, and I‚Äôd saved up enough money to buy the perfect engagement ring. The band was made of three beautifully braided strips of white gold. On either side of the diamond were two rectangular cut pieces of dark-blue tourmaline that matched the color of her eyes.

I had proposed on our three-year anniversary, and we married a few months later in October. It was an outdoor wedding, and the crisp-fall air wafted orange and yellow leaves through our ceremony. Maybe we were too young at the time; we were still living in a small apartment barely scraping by. It didn‚Äôt feel like it mattered, we were all we needed. As she walked the aisle, I remember thinking how stunning she looked in her white dress. It was as if I were seeing her again for the first time. Nobody else could take their eyes off her either. Maddison‚Äôs radiance was more pronounced than ever.

Months went by into our new life, and the honeymoon phase began. Our families sent us on a two-week trip to New York City. I think that was the happiest I ever felt‚Ä¶ I would give anything to re-live those two weeks again for the rest of my life. Maybe not the trip itself, just the feelings we shared together during it. The cruel reality of experiencing one‚Äôs happiest days is contending in a world wherein you know you will never have them again.

We returned home from half a month of shopping and eating and sightseeing, and lovemaking, to a two-room apartment. Life resumed, as did its responsibilities. We both went back to our respective jobs, looking forward to coming home in the evenings and enjoying each other‚Äôs company.

I started returning to the Killing Tree again. I‚Äôd forgotten how much I‚Äôd missed it and the peace it brought me. However, something unexpected happened. A few months after our honeymoon, Maddison asked if she could go with me.

I was thrilled to be sharing the experience of the tree with my wife. I wasn‚Äôt really sure why she‚Äôd had a change of heart, but I didn‚Äôt question it either. I told her she was absolutely welcome to accompany me and agreed to take her along the next time I went.

It was a few days later when we both had off together. We set out shortly after midday, drove to a parking lot which was within walking distance of the tree. I took the lead.

It started out as a jovial experience, though, I could sense that Maddison was a little anxious. No doubt, still hung up on the stories and legends she had grown up hearing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be fine! You‚Äôll like it!‚Äù I reassured her, nearly stumbling over a root thereafter. She laughed, but I could hear discomfort in it.

When we were almost at the tree, Maddison stopped with her arms crossed.

‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù I asked her.

‚ÄúI want to go back‚Ä¶‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúSweetie, I don‚Äôt-‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm serious. I don‚Äôt want to be out here.‚Äù Maddison‚Äôs face was pale, and her eyes locked to mine.

It was still hours away from being dark, and we were only a minute‚Äôs walk from the clearing. ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ well, you can wait here? I‚Äôll be right back. It‚Äôs just up ahead.‚Äù

‚ÄúStop!‚Äù Her voice had a crack in it. ‚ÄúI want to go back!‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt going to waste the trip. It was halfway through summer, and the Killing Tree would be lush with cherries. We had already come so far, and I really didn‚Äôt want to walk her back to the car, drive her home, then come back to do the hike over. I‚Äôll admit, I was annoyed with her, and it crept into my voice. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs right up here! I‚Äôm walking up to see it.‚Äù There‚Äôs nothing to be afraid of, I promise.‚Äù

Maddison remained silent, looking at the ground.

I sweetened my voice to the best of my ability. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll only be a minute.‚Äù I did feel bad and knew I was being selfish in expecting her to go with me, but I also felt a bit as though she was being selfish in a way by asking to come along, only to ask to go back at the last minute. I attempted to justify my choice to keep going by telling myself that if she wanted to go back, she easily could. In the back of my mind though, I knew that wasn‚Äôt true. Maddison had no chance of navigating out of the woods on her own. She didn‚Äôt really have any choice other than to follow me.

As we stepped into the clearing, I felt an intense warmth fill my chest. It was as if a wave of rejuvenating positivity had washed over my soul and put my mind at peace. I walked up to the old cherry tree and plucked a few of the ripe dark bulbs from its branches, before popping one into my mouth. ‚ÄúMmmmh!‚Äù I savored the ripe flesh, before spitting the pit on the ground. ‚ÄúMaddison! You should try one!‚Äù

Maddison was staring at the tree with her eyes wide, visibly shaking.

‚ÄúMaddison? It‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs just a tree like any other.‚Äù

‚ÄúTake me back.‚Äù She begged.

‚ÄúSeriously! Try one!‚Äù I held one of the cherries out as I approached her.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! I don‚Äôt want one!‚Äù She visibly recoiled as I approached her.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay! They‚Äôre just like any other cherry!‚Äù I held it out to her so she could see.

‚ÄúSTOP!‚Äù She screamed as tears ran down her cheeks. She slapped my hand away and tripped backwards into the mud sobbing. ‚ÄúPlease! Please take me home!‚Äù

I felt my blood boil upon having the cherries knocked from my hand. Still, I forced myself to take a step back and recollect myself. I was angry that my wife had brought a feeling of negativity into the special place I had shared with her. No doubt, I would be thinking about this incident the next time I visited the clearing. Still, I supposed it wasn‚Äôt her fault. Nobody else was able to truly see the beauty of the Killing Tree. I shouldn‚Äôt have expected her to be any different.

‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù I helped her up to her feet and led her back through the forest by her arm. She didn‚Äôt say anything on the way back to the car, nor on the drive home. She just stared off into the distance in a daze. Whenever I tried to make conversation with her, she would look anywhere but at me.

We got home and she went straight to the shower. That night, in bed, neither of us said a word.

In the week that followed, she slowly opened back up to me. I apologized to her, bought her flowers and candy, made dinner one night and rented a movie for us to watch. Things slowly went back to a facsimile of how they had been. It wasn‚Äôt completely the same though. Something had changed between us. Nothing major, but it was like something in our relationship had changed. It was like we had both been made acutely aware of the fact that we didn‚Äôt completely get along on everything.

This realization began to manifest itself in small ways throughout our life together. I would leave a light on while leaving the room, and she would get petty for an hour. I‚Äôd vacuum when she wasn‚Äôt doing anything, only for her to roll her eyes and storm out of the apartment in a huff until I was done. I brought gifts home less and less and didn‚Äôt ask her what she wanted for dinner as often. It wasn‚Äôt like that all the time between us. Not even most of the time. We were still in love and still burning strong for each other. But we fought now, which was something we had never really done before.

The fighting got more intense with the passage of time. Many days, it seemed like Maddison would find reasons to be upset with me. She would start fights with me over the apartment being messy when she found a single surface with dust on it. She started seeming less impressed with the gifts I would give her. She spent less and less time around me and would go out more often during the nights with her friends. I didn‚Äôt have friends‚Ä¶ I was losing my only source of social interaction.

We started fighting about finances as well. I knew Maddison wanted kids. She had been an only child and had always made it clear she wanted children of her own someday. I did too, but we couldn‚Äôt afford it. I was looking for better work but had no luck finding any. Maddison watched her friends and piers move on with their lives, as her husband floundered and struggled to achieve more.

One night, just before our third marriage anniversary, Maddison was going through the mail and sighed.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up sweetie?‚Äù I asked her.

‚ÄúBank account.‚Äù She held up the paper from across the room. ‚ÄúWe really don‚Äôt have any savings.‚Äù

We were both working full time, but neither of us made more than a few bucks over minimum wage. Still, it‚Äôd felt like what she‚Äôd said had held accusatory connotations. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry sweetie. I‚Äôm doing my best.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you are.‚Äù She said flatly.¬† I felt my face start to heat with embarrassment and shame. Maybe rage.

‚ÄúI am! I‚Äôm doing everything I can to find more work!‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you are.‚Äù She spoke.

‚ÄúI just haven‚Äôt been successful!‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you haven‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù I stood up. ‚ÄúJust get it out.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm not bringing in enough money! I‚Äôm going to find good work! We‚Äôll get some more money under our belt and figure things out.‚Äù I really was trying. Trying and struggling.

Maddison didn‚Äôt say much. She just looked around our apartment somberly. ‚ÄúYou know Kenny bought a house recently?‚Äù

I was taken aback by this. Kenny was one of her coworkers. ‚ÄúOf course, Kenny bought a house‚Ä¶ He was in the Marines.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was never in any fights!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter! He still would‚Äôve qualified for the GI bill!‚Äù I paced back and forth and shook my head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know Maddison, maybe you should‚Äôve married a vet or something.‚Äù I jabbed.

Maddison said nothing. She said nothing for a painfully long time. I felt something inside me rip.

‚ÄúSweetie?‚Äù

She shook her head, as though snapping out of a daydream. ‚ÄúSorry. I love you.‚Äù She hugged me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. We‚Äôre okay. Work will come, okay? I believe in you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love you too.‚Äù I said, trying to push down the feeling of betrayal. Whether it had been justified or imagined, it tortured me all the same.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to bed. Are you coming?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúEventually. I need to clear my head, first.‚Äù

That night, after Maddison went to bed, I went back to the Killing Tree. I had never gone at night. I was always too afraid of venturing into the woods after sundown. But then, I was 25. I knew that patch of forest like the back of my hand. On top of that, I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to sleep worth shit after that conversation. I was off work the next day, so I saw no harm in going out late.

Everything around me was lit up beneath the light of a mostly full moon. The forest was much different at night. Everything I was familiar with had a new sense of danger to it as I treaded lightly through the leaves and underbrush. I thought back to my childhood desire to be scared, which had driven me to seek out the Killing Tree to begin with. Now, on the other side of a world I knew so intimately, I felt myself reconnecting with that sense of macabre fascination once more.

As I entered the clearing, I sat beneath the Killing Tree and slumped against it. I punched the dirt, not really sure if I wanted scream or not. I knew in some way, Maddison was right. I knew I was failing to give us both a better life for ourselves. Our friends went off to college or the military or trade school or climbed their own corporate ladders. I felt stuck. I was failing the woman I loved. Worse than that, I was aware that she knew I was failing.

Something thudded near my foot, and I looked down. A cherry had fallen from the Killing Tree. I chuckled. Whenever I needed this place, it was here for me. I popped the fruit into my mouth and spat out the pit to my side. I could feel my eyes growing heavy, but I didn‚Äôt have the strength to make myself get up. Instead, I drifted into unconsciousness, wrapped in the atmospheric blanket of the clearing.

When I awoke the next morning, it was already almost noon. My phone was filled with texts from my wife.

*<Where are you?> <Are you okay?> <You‚Äôd better be okay> <I‚Äôm so fucking pissed right now> <Seriously, where are you!?>*

I sped home as fast as I could. Maddison was at work, and I started panicking. I hadn‚Äôt intended to fall asleep; it just sort of happened. I texted her back.¬†*<I‚Äôm so sorry. I went to visit the clearing last night and fell asleep while there. I‚Äôm fine. I have dinner on for when you get home.>*¬†After thinking for a second, I sent one more text.¬†*<Love you.>*

She left me on read.

That night, when Maddison got home, she walked right past me without saying anything.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry about last night.‚Äù I could feel the anger radiating off her. ‚ÄúI made spaghetti and meatballs! Remember when I made spaghetti and meatballs the first time I ever cooked for you? And you described it as the ‚Äòspaghettiest‚Äô spaghetti you had ever tasted? That was wild.‚Äù I was hoping that I could warm through her icy demeanor. ‚ÄúYou know, I was thinking about what we could watch tonight-‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this.‚Äù She cut me off. The pain in my chest I had felt the night before came back tenfold. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stay here tonight. Or for a while. I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù My wife looked at me with tears in her eyes. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be around you right now.‚Äù

My vision blurred as something warm streaks ran from my eyes down my cheeks. ‚ÄúI- I don‚Äôt understand?‚Äù I stepped towards her, and she stepped back. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

She shook her head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so smart. I think you do.‚Äù

‚ÄúI-‚Äù I was at a loss for words as my world shattered. ‚ÄúI thought- You said you loved me last night!?‚Äù

‚ÄúI do. I Just can‚Äôt live like this. Not forever. At least, not for right now. And we married so young, and-‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you regret marrying me?!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! I-‚Äù Maddison rubbed her eyes and stood up as straight as she could. ‚ÄúI need to go.‚Äù

I watched as she went into the bedroom, shoved a few days‚Äô worth of clothes into a plastic bag, and left. It was just me, in a little apartment that felt way too big now that I was alone.

I texted her all throughout the next day. She never read any of them. I called her phone a few times but always got sent straight to voicemail. At work I felt sick and miserable. When I was off, I went to the Killing Tree almost daily, just to give myself something to do. I couldn‚Äôt stand to be in our apartment. Her things were suffocating to be around.

One day, I came home to discover the rest of her clothes were missing from our dresser. Several other things of hers were also gone from the apartment. She had come back when I was away and taken more of her stuff. This felt like it tore me open even further. It was a pain unlike anything I‚Äôd ever thought myself capable of experiencing. That pain turned to anger. We were supposed to be partners We both promised ‚Äòtil death do us part‚Äô.

My anger grew more and more bitter. Daily, I hoped she would reach out to me so we could talk things through. However, despite wanting to talk to her so much, there was a piece of me that fantasized endlessly about rudely crushing her if she did. I imagined her approaching me out of the blue, telling me she had made a mistake and wanted to be part of my life again; only so I could tell her to fuck off and see the spark extinguish from her eyes. Deep down, I knew I didn‚Äôt want to hurt her; I just wanted the emotional catharsis of her understanding and experiencing the pain I was feeling.

My rage reached a tipping point one night, when I got drunk and angrily sent her two messages in a fit of petulant rage.¬†*<I wish I never slept with you at the graduation party.> <Delete your photos of me. You don‚Äôt deserve to have those memories.>*

I cracked open another hard cider, laughing to myself at the pain I imagined the texts caused her. Five minutes later, my phone buzzed in my pocket and my heart skipped a beat when I read it.

*<I‚Äôd like to talk to you at some point when your available>*

Serotonin lit up my brain at the excitement of being able to talk to her again. Only now, I wasn‚Äôt angry. I was hopeful and ecstatic.¬†*<Where and when?>*

*<Tomorrow evening. Our place.>*

*<Sure>*¬†My heart raced at the thought of seeing her face again so soon. Not only that, but she referred to it as¬†***our***¬†place!¬†*‚ÄòShe must still see us living together!‚Äô,*¬†I thought gleefully. I found myself typing a little bit more.¬†*<I‚Äôve missed you!>*

I took off work the next day so I could get everything ready for Maddison‚Äôs arrival. I washed the dishes, vacuumed, dusted, threw out the empty cans and bottles that had accumulated around my bed, etc. I didn‚Äôt know what time she had planned on coming over, but I was guessing it wouldn‚Äôt be too late in the evening.

When I heard the knock at the door, it was close to 7:30 pm. I gulped back my anxiety, as I worked up the courage to open it.

Maddison looked as radiant as ever. Her hair was messy and unkempt. She was wearing grey hoodie and sweatpants. She wasn‚Äôt wearing any makeup. She was herself, as I alone knew her to be. I felt like I was seeing her again for the first time!

‚ÄúCome in!‚Äù I insisted. ‚ÄúAre you okay? How was your day?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. It was good. Let‚Äôs sit down.‚Äù

Maddison sat down on the couch. I sat next to her; not too close, but still a little hurt when she scooted further down from me.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs up?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúYou wanted to talk?‚Äù

Maddison eyed me up and down from two cushions away, unblinking and expressionless. ‚ÄúYou regret sleeping with me?‚Äù

I was taken aback. ‚ÄúI- I was- see, I was drinking last night, okay? I was frustrated and-‚Äù

‚ÄúI regret sleeping with you.‚Äù

I felt what little of my heart remained shattering inside my chest. My breathing got heavy, and I turned away from her so she couldn‚Äôt directly see my eyes go misty. ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù I managed to squeak out.

‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù Maddison said. I could hear the pain in her own voice as well.

‚ÄúIf you love me, why are you doing this?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI love you, but this is weird. You‚Äôve been acting weird for a long time and I don‚Äôt feel comfortable here anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about!‚Äù

‚ÄúReally!? The fucking ways you‚Äôve been acting manipulative towards me for months?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been acting manipulative?? You fucking left!‚Äù

‚ÄúTyler, you‚Äôve been playing fucking mind-games with me, and I hate it! You get weird when I hang out with my friends in the evenings! You over-misinterpret things I say as me starting fights! You spam messages at me whenever I don‚Äôt respond to you about anything and it‚Äôs weird!‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt understand what the fuck she was talking about or why she was trying to throw her actions back on me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about not coming home when I did. I just-‚Äù

‚ÄúTHE TREE IS NOT THE FUCKING PROBLEM, TYLER!!!‚Äù Maddison was practically shouting. ‚ÄúYou act like you‚Äôre fucking entitled to me, and I don‚Äôt know why you don‚Äôt see it!‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I don‚Äôt act like that!‚Äù I decided to try a different tactic. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bringing in more money!‚Äù I lied. ‚ÄúI just got offered a raise!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about money either. You‚Äôre not good for me. I can‚Äôt live the rest of my life like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have more to offer than before you left.‚Äù

She slid closer to me and her hand rested on mine. I pulled my arm away out of anger and immediately wished I could feel her hand again. That was probably going to be the last time I ever felt the love of my life‚Äôs hand.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll change.‚Äù I whimpered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be better. I‚Äôll find work. I‚Äôll give you the life you deserve.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou just said you got a raise.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll find better work. Much better.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about the life¬†*you*¬†deserve?‚Äù She asked. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not thinking about yourself, only me. This isn‚Äôt healthy! You can‚Äôt only force yourself to find something better on someone else‚Äôs behalf! And it‚Äôs not fair for you to live for someone YOU think expects you to be different.‚Äù Maddison stood up. ‚ÄúI want you to be happy. I want to be happy. This isn‚Äôt working out. You changed after we got married. It‚Äôs like you felt like you locked me in and the real you started coming out.‚Äù

I still didn‚Äôt know what she was on about. ‚ÄúYou want a divorce?‚Äù

‚ÄúEventually. When we can both handle it.‚Äù She walked in front of me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to sit in a divorce court now. I don‚Äôt think you do either. Right now, we just need to learn to exist away from each other. It‚Äôs for the best, I promise.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to live without you!‚Äù I was raising my voice now.

‚ÄúTyler, I need you to listen to me‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt live without you!‚Äù I screamed.

Maddison backed away slowly. ‚ÄúYes. You can‚Ä¶ You¬†*have*¬†been. You‚Äôre strong. You‚Äôre a smart person. But Tyler, this isn‚Äôt healthy‚Ä¶ Please try to understand.‚Äù She was backing towards the door.

‚ÄúWait!‚Äù I stood up. This was my last chance to convince her to stay. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go! Please!‚Äù I grabbed her wrist and tried to pull her back to me.

‚ÄúLet go!‚Äù Maddison struggled against my grasp. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this! Stop!‚Äù

Maddison tried pulling the door open. I pushed it shut with my free hand. ‚ÄúPlease just listen! I can‚Äôt say goodbye to you again!‚Äù

‚ÄúTyler! Let me the fuck go!‚Äù There was a loud clap, and I felt my face start to sting. Maddison and I both looked at each other shocked for a second, unsure if it had really happened, before she slapped me a second time. Then a third. ‚ÄúLet go! Don‚Äôt touch me! Let go! Let go! LET GO!!!‚Äù

My memory starts blurs here a bit, so I‚Äôll do my best to describe what happened next: I pulled Maddison away from the door with all my might, swung her around, and shoved her towards the coffee table. She stumbled across it, fell back and landed on her neck. She cried out as her limbs flailed and she tried to reorient herself. I didn‚Äôt give her the opportunity, closing the distance between her and I before grabbing her by the hair and slamming the back of her head into the floor. She stopped screaming, immediately dazed by what had happened. I had no intention of giving her the opportunity to resume, slamming her head once more before straddling her chest and beginning to rain blows upon her face.

This is where my memory completely fogs over. I don‚Äôt know how many times I punched her or for how long. I don‚Äôt remember when her begging faded into distorted gurgles, or when her body went limp. I just remember sitting over her‚Ä¶ My hand was the color of an unpainted brick wall. My entire body burned an icy cold. I stared straight ahead for what felt like an hour, before forcing myself to look down.

Maddison had no face. If one were to closely examine the pulverized fleshy mass, they might faintly recognize the distorted features of what had once been somebody‚Äôs only child.

I screamed. I ran to one of the drawers in the kitchen space and pulled out a large knife that I used to slice my arm open. I was trying my hardest to awaken from a nightmare I knew wasn‚Äôt the case. My blood pooled across the floor, and that combined with what I had done sent me into a shock which lasted for hours.

I sat next to Maddison, shaking and wishing the self-inflicted wound on my arm had been enough to kill me. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to look at her directly. I didn‚Äôt want to see what I had done to her face. Even still, I could very clearly see her legs sprawled out on the floor in front of me as I stared off into the distance.

Eventually, light shone through the window as day broke. I didn‚Äôt bother calling out of work again. I just stayed home with Maddison. I wasn‚Äôt hungry. I wasn‚Äôt tired. I didn‚Äôt even need to use the bathroom all day. I just sat on the floor next to her, doing my best not to look at her directly.

There were flies on Maddison.

After half a day of sitting with her, the shock of what had happened started wearing off. I cried. I bawled my eyes out. I had murdered my whole world, the only woman I would ever love, and life had no reason to continue. Yet, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to end it all. I think I deserved to die, but I couldn‚Äôt work up the courage to attempt it. I knew Maddison wouldn‚Äôt have wanted that for me. Even through everything, she had always loved me; she wouldn‚Äôt have wanted me to throw my life away alongside hers.

I realized it was only a matter of time before someone came to check in here and discovered what I had done. I decided that I needed to move her out of our apartment. To do that, I needed to reduce her weight and mass. The thought of intentionally damaging Maddison made me puke my empty stomach into the sink. I couldn‚Äôt leave her where she was though. ¬†

I took the kitchen knife I had used to slice my arm the night prior. Approaching Maddison‚Äôs body, I crouched next to her and closed my eyes. Clenched my teeth and put my hand on her cold, stiff chest. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù

I began to disassemble Maddison.

I put her limbs into a trash bag, along with all the trash which I hadn‚Äôt taken out in a week. At a glance, you couldn‚Äôt even tell that the bag contained Maddison‚Äôs severed appendages. I took the trash out to the dumpster in the parking lot, making sure to remove a few of the bags already in there and put them on top of my contribution. I had ensured that the first half of her would likely never be found, now I had to handle the second half.

I didn‚Äôt want to just throw Maddison‚Äôs torso and what remained of her head away. I felt like her heart and mind, the parts of her which most made up who she had been, deserved to be taken somewhere nice. Somewhere beautiful and quiet, where I can visit her still in the future. I couldn‚Äôt give her a proper burial or a grave-marker, but I could return her to nature. If say, her body were to feed something greater, would she not in some way live on?

I stuffed Maddison‚Äôs into a luggage bag and rolled her into my car. I put the case in the passenger seat, made sure it was buckled in nicely for her, and drove to the parking lot closest to the clearing. Nobody was around when I‚Äôd gotten there. Nobody saw me pull the luggage bag out of the passenger seat, extend the handle, and set off with it into the woods.

The forest was dead silent the entire walk. There were no evening birds chirping or squirrels chasing one another throughout the leaves. The wind lay dormant. The only sound amongst the trees, beneath the encroaching twilight, was me walking with the woman I loved.

When the clearing came into sight, I felt tears well up within my eyes. My chest constricted, and I felt the melancholic acceptance one feels upon the realization that a chapter in their life is forever over. My marriage to Maddison ended that day. She left me, returned, announced she‚Äôd wanted a divorce, then left again. She went missing. The police would inevitably check in, but I had no idea where she had gone. I love her, still. Completely and unconditionally, that will never change. I still feel angry though. My body still burns with the fire of her betrayal.

I leaned the bag against the Killing Tree, slowly unzipped it and gently pulled Maddison into my arms. Before I laid her to the dirt beside the gnarled cherry, I wanted to hold her one last time. It wasn‚Äôt the same. Maddison was cold and distant. I gently stroked her hair away from the pulp her eyes stared up at me through. Even though I loved her with all my heart, part of me hated her for abjuring her vows. She promised at the altar. I felt taken advantage of for believing her.

I laid her down and sat next to her one last time. My mind raced back to when Maddison had come here with me, and it caused that first fight almost a year prior. I did wish she would‚Äôve liked her final resting place more whilst alive.

Flies had already found their way to her, as quickly as mosquitoes had set upon me. Sunset had fallen now, and I stared up at the quickly darkening sky above. Or at least, what I could see of it through the branches and the leaves. Among them, the black cherries I had enjoyed for what felt like my whole life. Few things remain consistent. Someday, perhaps in my lifetime, the Killing Tree would die as well. Someday. But for the time being, I closed my eyes and drifted off to sleep once again. A deep sleep with dreams of cherries and a small apartment‚Ä¶ and eyes.

1le2j79,https://www.reddit.com/r/campfirecreeps/comments/1le2j79/cherries_in_the_killing_tree/,Cherries in the Killing Tree,"In the woods, not too far from my childhood home, there is a large circular clearing where nothing grows‚Ä¶ save for a single black cherry tree in the very center. The Killing Tree, as it is locally well-known. I should clarify; this is not an obscure name for it in these parts. Nobody, except me, ever ventures out to see it; and if they do, they never dare venture more than once.

Once upon a time, shortly after the founding of our town, a body was discovered lying in the center of the clearing. The victim was never identified. Nobody knew who the body had been, nor even whether they had been a man or a woman. It was barely even a body‚Ä¶ more of a disemboweled torso with chunks of muscle missing. The arms and legs were nowhere to be found, and the head was closer to being a skull than not. On top of all that, the body had been lying there for quite some time and was putrefying.

No suspect was ever apprehended.

After the body had been removed, a sprout had taken root in the center of the clearing. The sprout grew to a tree, and nothing else dared grow near it. No grass, shrubs, flowers, or ferns. There was probably a perfectly logical reason for that. There could‚Äôve been something wrong with the soil, or maybe an issue with the quality of light the area received. Maybe the tree was soaking up all the nutrients that could‚Äôve gone to anything else. Who‚Äôs to say? It didn‚Äôt stop people from concocting their own wild speculations about why the rest of the forest refused to encroach upon the ground near the Killing Tree.

Our small community is on the edge of Garret County. Near as close as you can get to the edge of Maryland, without crossing over into Preston, West Virginia. We‚Äôre rural, is what I‚Äôm saying. And‚Ä¶ a lot of us are more than a tad superstitious. Rumors began to circulate amongst the locals that the tree hadn‚Äôt grown from any seed. Rather, it was the manifested embodiment of the terrible fate the victim had endured before being deposited there. The suffering they had experienced had been so great, it had taken on a life of its own. A tree‚Ä¶ around which nothing could grow.

People report feeling nauseous from even looking at the Killing Tree. Some experience panic attacks and supposedly there has even been one heart attack in the clearing over a decade ago. There are even still rumors of hikers who passed too near to it and mysteriously disappeared, though, none have ever been substantiated. Nonetheless, everyone around here avoids going anywhere near that tree to this day. Everyone, it seems, except me.

I think I was eleven, when I first ventured out to see the Killing Tree. I was the only kid in my school who was brave enough to do so, whilst also living close enough to attempt such a venture. I was young, dumb, and bored; looking for ways to entertain myself. I was also a social outcast and didn‚Äôt fit in with anyone in my peer group. At that age, I was obsessed, it seemed, with the pursuit of scaring myself however and whenever I could. I would peer out my bedroom window at night into the backyard and watch for monsters. I would poke around the many abandoned houses in my neighborhood whenever I thought nobody was looking. At school, I would bore disinterested classmates with tall tales about the Sasquatch that I alone believed lived in the woods outside our town.

I was a seeker of the macabre. Yet, there was one thrill above all others that nobody I knew had ever attempted. Probably, because everyone‚Äôs parents would have beaten them viciously if they found out their child had done what I had dared to do. I certainly know my parents would have.

I‚Äôd hiked into the woods and walked for close to an hour before I found the clearing. I didn‚Äôt know exactly where it was, so I spent a lot of time just walking around aimlessly until I found it. I still think I‚Äôm quite lucky I didn‚Äôt get lost.

Stepping into the clearing, my sneakers left prints in the mud. In the center it sat imposing, gnarly, branches grasping upwards towards the empty sky. It looked ancient and dark and powerful‚Ä¶ just like any other tree in the woods.

I was taken aback by how ordinary the Killing Tree really seemed to be. I‚Äôll admit, I was a tad disappointed. I had been hoping to find something which would disturb me, odd as that sounds. Not only was this tree seemingly un-special, it was also easier to climb than most other trees, which made it all the friendlier in my child mind. It felt like common sense that a perfect climbing tree could hold no malice.

I returned to it often and would climb it each time and swing from its branches. In the summers, I would pick the wild black cherries from and partake in them to my stomach‚Äôs content. Even when I grew older past my desires to climb the Killing Tree, I frequented it often as a place of respite from the world. Years went by and the tree was a place of comfort to me. A dark little sanctuary where I could go to escape my continual feelings of disappointment towards others. And though I heard folks mention it from time to time, never once did I ever see another person there.

In time, my social maladjustments gave way, and I formed a small but tight-knit friend group. We did most things together, but never once did I ever take any of them to the Killing Tree with me. I never even offered. It was my special place, and I couldn‚Äôt imagine sharing it with anyone else. I‚Äôd yet to be in love though.

I met my wife, Maddison, at a graduation party when we were both eighteen. We‚Äôd been drinking at someone‚Äôs house and stayed up talking past everyone else passing out or leaving for another party. For some reason, she liked me. More surprisingly, she still liked me the next morning when we woke up together. She‚Äôs beautiful. Brunette, eyes that glow the color of the sky on a cloudy day and a smile that could outshine the sun. For lack of a better word, she‚Äôs radiant. Everyone around her saw it. She always walked through life like she was dancing as well. I was head-over-heels for her the second I woke up to her beaming smile.

We started dating shortly after that night. I got my first job, partially just so I‚Äôd have money to be able to spend on things we could do together. Maddison became my world, and I think I had become hers as well. We did everything together. We went to parties, took day-long road trips, went on walks and more. On nights we weren‚Äôt together, we‚Äôd stay up late talking on the phone and would fall asleep without hanging up. Eventually we got our first place together: a tiny apartment that cozily kept us in proximity with each other. Even still, there was one place I had never taken her.

I had told Maddison I frequented the Killing Tree on my own, but she never went with me. She didn‚Äôt even believe me at first, suspecting I was bullshitting about going there to sound cool or to impress her.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I told her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious. It‚Äôs my safe place.‚Äù

Maddison had paused for a bit before giggling and playfully bumping into me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre weird! You‚Äôd better not bring anything negative home with you!‚Äù

I laughed it off, but secretly I was a little disappointed. Part of me had been hoping that she would want to go there with me, and I could finally share my favorite place with someone. It was okay though; my second favorite place was a two-room apartment with the woman I loved.

After almost two years of living together, I had decided the time had come to pop the question. We were 22, and I‚Äôd saved up enough money to buy the perfect engagement ring. The band was made of three beautifully braided strips of white gold. On either side of the diamond were two rectangular cut pieces of dark-blue tourmaline that matched the color of her eyes.

I had proposed on our three-year anniversary, and we married a few months later in October. It was an outdoor wedding, and the crisp-fall air wafted orange and yellow leaves through our ceremony. Maybe we were too young at the time; we were still living in a small apartment barely scraping by. It didn‚Äôt feel like it mattered, we were all we needed. As she walked the aisle, I remember thinking how stunning she looked in her white dress. It was as if I were seeing her again for the first time. Nobody else could take their eyes off her either. Maddison‚Äôs radiance was more pronounced than ever.

Months went by into our new life, and the honeymoon phase began. Our families sent us on a two-week trip to New York City. I think that was the happiest I ever felt‚Ä¶ I would give anything to re-live those two weeks again for the rest of my life. Maybe not the trip itself, just the feelings we shared together during it. The cruel reality of experiencing one‚Äôs happiest days is contending in a world wherein you know you will never have them again.

We returned home from half a month of shopping and eating and sightseeing, and lovemaking, to a two-room apartment. Life resumed, as did its responsibilities. We both went back to our respective jobs, looking forward to coming home in the evenings and enjoying each other‚Äôs company.

I started returning to the Killing Tree again. I‚Äôd forgotten how much I‚Äôd missed it and the peace it brought me. However, something unexpected happened. A few months after our honeymoon, Maddison asked if she could go with me.

I was thrilled to be sharing the experience of the tree with my wife. I wasn‚Äôt really sure why she‚Äôd had a change of heart, but I didn‚Äôt question it either. I told her she was absolutely welcome to accompany me and agreed to take her along the next time I went.

It was a few days later when we both had off together. We set out shortly after midday, drove to a parking lot which was within walking distance of the tree. I took the lead.

It started out as a jovial experience, though, I could sense that Maddison was a little anxious. No doubt, still hung up on the stories and legends she had grown up hearing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be fine! You‚Äôll like it!‚Äù I reassured her, nearly stumbling over a root thereafter. She laughed, but I could hear discomfort in it.

When we were almost at the tree, Maddison stopped with her arms crossed.

‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù I asked her.

‚ÄúI want to go back‚Ä¶‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúSweetie, I don‚Äôt-‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm serious. I don‚Äôt want to be out here.‚Äù Maddison‚Äôs face was pale, and her eyes locked to mine.

It was still hours away from being dark, and we were only a minute‚Äôs walk from the clearing. ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ well, you can wait here? I‚Äôll be right back. It‚Äôs just up ahead.‚Äù

‚ÄúStop!‚Äù Her voice had a crack in it. ‚ÄúI want to go back!‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt going to waste the trip. It was halfway through summer, and the Killing Tree would be lush with cherries. We had already come so far, and I really didn‚Äôt want to walk her back to the car, drive her home, then come back to do the hike over. I‚Äôll admit, I was annoyed with her, and it crept into my voice. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs right up here! I‚Äôm walking up to see it.‚Äù There‚Äôs nothing to be afraid of, I promise.‚Äù

Maddison remained silent, looking at the ground.

I sweetened my voice to the best of my ability. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll only be a minute.‚Äù I did feel bad and knew I was being selfish in expecting her to go with me, but I also felt a bit as though she was being selfish in a way by asking to come along, only to ask to go back at the last minute. I attempted to justify my choice to keep going by telling myself that if she wanted to go back, she easily could. In the back of my mind though, I knew that wasn‚Äôt true. Maddison had no chance of navigating out of the woods on her own. She didn‚Äôt really have any choice other than to follow me.

As we stepped into the clearing, I felt an intense warmth fill my chest. It was as if a wave of rejuvenating positivity had washed over my soul and put my mind at peace. I walked up to the old cherry tree and plucked a few of the ripe dark bulbs from its branches, before popping one into my mouth. ‚ÄúMmmmh!‚Äù I savored the ripe flesh, before spitting the pit on the ground. ‚ÄúMaddison! You should try one!‚Äù

Maddison was staring at the tree with her eyes wide, visibly shaking.

‚ÄúMaddison? It‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs just a tree like any other.‚Äù

‚ÄúTake me back.‚Äù She begged.

‚ÄúSeriously! Try one!‚Äù I held one of the cherries out as I approached her.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! I don‚Äôt want one!‚Äù She visibly recoiled as I approached her.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay! They‚Äôre just like any other cherry!‚Äù I held it out to her so she could see.

‚ÄúSTOP!‚Äù She screamed as tears ran down her cheeks. She slapped my hand away and tripped backwards into the mud sobbing. ‚ÄúPlease! Please take me home!‚Äù

I felt my blood boil upon having the cherries knocked from my hand. Still, I forced myself to take a step back and recollect myself. I was angry that my wife had brought a feeling of negativity into the special place I had shared with her. No doubt, I would be thinking about this incident the next time I visited the clearing. Still, I supposed it wasn‚Äôt her fault. Nobody else was able to truly see the beauty of the Killing Tree. I shouldn‚Äôt have expected her to be any different.

‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù I helped her up to her feet and led her back through the forest by her arm. She didn‚Äôt say anything on the way back to the car, nor on the drive home. She just stared off into the distance in a daze. Whenever I tried to make conversation with her, she would look anywhere but at me.

We got home and she went straight to the shower. That night, in bed, neither of us said a word.

In the week that followed, she slowly opened back up to me. I apologized to her, bought her flowers and candy, made dinner one night and rented a movie for us to watch. Things slowly went back to a facsimile of how they had been. It wasn‚Äôt completely the same though. Something had changed between us. Nothing major, but it was like something in our relationship had changed. It was like we had both been made acutely aware of the fact that we didn‚Äôt completely get along on everything.

This realization began to manifest itself in small ways throughout our life together. I would leave a light on while leaving the room, and she would get petty for an hour. I‚Äôd vacuum when she wasn‚Äôt doing anything, only for her to roll her eyes and storm out of the apartment in a huff until I was done. I brought gifts home less and less and didn‚Äôt ask her what she wanted for dinner as often. It wasn‚Äôt like that all the time between us. Not even most of the time. We were still in love and still burning strong for each other. But we fought now, which was something we had never really done before.

The fighting got more intense with the passage of time. Many days, it seemed like Maddison would find reasons to be upset with me. She would start fights with me over the apartment being messy when she found a single surface with dust on it. She started seeming less impressed with the gifts I would give her. She spent less and less time around me and would go out more often during the nights with her friends. I didn‚Äôt have friends‚Ä¶ I was losing my only source of social interaction.

We started fighting about finances as well. I knew Maddison wanted kids. She had been an only child and had always made it clear she wanted children of her own someday. I did too, but we couldn‚Äôt afford it. I was looking for better work but had no luck finding any. Maddison watched her friends and piers move on with their lives, as her husband floundered and struggled to achieve more.

One night, just before our third marriage anniversary, Maddison was going through the mail and sighed.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up sweetie?‚Äù I asked her.

‚ÄúBank account.‚Äù She held up the paper from across the room. ‚ÄúWe really don‚Äôt have any savings.‚Äù

We were both working full time, but neither of us made more than a few bucks over minimum wage. Still, it‚Äôd felt like what she‚Äôd said had held accusatory connotations. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry sweetie. I‚Äôm doing my best.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you are.‚Äù She said flatly.¬† I felt my face start to heat with embarrassment and shame. Maybe rage.

‚ÄúI am! I‚Äôm doing everything I can to find more work!‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you are.‚Äù She spoke.

‚ÄúI just haven‚Äôt been successful!‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you haven‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù I stood up. ‚ÄúJust get it out.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm not bringing in enough money! I‚Äôm going to find good work! We‚Äôll get some more money under our belt and figure things out.‚Äù I really was trying. Trying and struggling.

Maddison didn‚Äôt say much. She just looked around our apartment somberly. ‚ÄúYou know Kenny bought a house recently?‚Äù

I was taken aback by this. Kenny was one of her coworkers. ‚ÄúOf course, Kenny bought a house‚Ä¶ He was in the Marines.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was never in any fights!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter! He still would‚Äôve qualified for the GI bill!‚Äù I paced back and forth and shook my head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know Maddison, maybe you should‚Äôve married a vet or something.‚Äù I jabbed.

Maddison said nothing. She said nothing for a painfully long time. I felt something inside me rip.

‚ÄúSweetie?‚Äù

She shook her head, as though snapping out of a daydream. ‚ÄúSorry. I love you.‚Äù She hugged me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. We‚Äôre okay. Work will come, okay? I believe in you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love you too.‚Äù I said, trying to push down the feeling of betrayal. Whether it had been justified or imagined, it tortured me all the same.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to bed. Are you coming?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúEventually. I need to clear my head, first.‚Äù

That night, after Maddison went to bed, I went back to the Killing Tree. I had never gone at night. I was always too afraid of venturing into the woods after sundown. But then, I was 25. I knew that patch of forest like the back of my hand. On top of that, I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to sleep worth shit after that conversation. I was off work the next day, so I saw no harm in going out late.

Everything around me was lit up beneath the light of a mostly full moon. The forest was much different at night. Everything I was familiar with had a new sense of danger to it as I treaded lightly through the leaves and underbrush. I thought back to my childhood desire to be scared, which had driven me to seek out the Killing Tree to begin with. Now, on the other side of a world I knew so intimately, I felt myself reconnecting with that sense of macabre fascination once more.

As I entered the clearing, I sat beneath the Killing Tree and slumped against it. I punched the dirt, not really sure if I wanted scream or not. I knew in some way, Maddison was right. I knew I was failing to give us both a better life for ourselves. Our friends went off to college or the military or trade school or climbed their own corporate ladders. I felt stuck. I was failing the woman I loved. Worse than that, I was aware that she knew I was failing.

Something thudded near my foot, and I looked down. A cherry had fallen from the Killing Tree. I chuckled. Whenever I needed this place, it was here for me. I popped the fruit into my mouth and spat out the pit to my side. I could feel my eyes growing heavy, but I didn‚Äôt have the strength to make myself get up. Instead, I drifted into unconsciousness, wrapped in the atmospheric blanket of the clearing.

When I awoke the next morning, it was already almost noon. My phone was filled with texts from my wife.

*<Where are you?> <Are you okay?> <You‚Äôd better be okay> <I‚Äôm so fucking pissed right now> <Seriously, where are you!?>*

I sped home as fast as I could. Maddison was at work, and I started panicking. I hadn‚Äôt intended to fall asleep; it just sort of happened. I texted her back.¬†*<I‚Äôm so sorry. I went to visit the clearing last night and fell asleep while there. I‚Äôm fine. I have dinner on for when you get home.>*¬†After thinking for a second, I sent one more text.¬†*<Love you.>*

She left me on read.

That night, when Maddison got home, she walked right past me without saying anything.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry about last night.‚Äù I could feel the anger radiating off her. ‚ÄúI made spaghetti and meatballs! Remember when I made spaghetti and meatballs the first time I ever cooked for you? And you described it as the ‚Äòspaghettiest‚Äô spaghetti you had ever tasted? That was wild.‚Äù I was hoping that I could warm through her icy demeanor. ‚ÄúYou know, I was thinking about what we could watch tonight-‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this.‚Äù She cut me off. The pain in my chest I had felt the night before came back tenfold. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stay here tonight. Or for a while. I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù My wife looked at me with tears in her eyes. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be around you right now.‚Äù

My vision blurred as something warm streaks ran from my eyes down my cheeks. ‚ÄúI- I don‚Äôt understand?‚Äù I stepped towards her, and she stepped back. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

She shook her head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so smart. I think you do.‚Äù

‚ÄúI-‚Äù I was at a loss for words as my world shattered. ‚ÄúI thought- You said you loved me last night!?‚Äù

‚ÄúI do. I Just can‚Äôt live like this. Not forever. At least, not for right now. And we married so young, and-‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you regret marrying me?!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! I-‚Äù Maddison rubbed her eyes and stood up as straight as she could. ‚ÄúI need to go.‚Äù

I watched as she went into the bedroom, shoved a few days‚Äô worth of clothes into a plastic bag, and left. It was just me, in a little apartment that felt way too big now that I was alone.

I texted her all throughout the next day. She never read any of them. I called her phone a few times but always got sent straight to voicemail. At work I felt sick and miserable. When I was off, I went to the Killing Tree almost daily, just to give myself something to do. I couldn‚Äôt stand to be in our apartment. Her things were suffocating to be around.

One day, I came home to discover the rest of her clothes were missing from our dresser. Several other things of hers were also gone from the apartment. She had come back when I was away and taken more of her stuff. This felt like it tore me open even further. It was a pain unlike anything I‚Äôd ever thought myself capable of experiencing. That pain turned to anger. We were supposed to be partners We both promised ‚Äòtil death do us part‚Äô.

My anger grew more and more bitter. Daily, I hoped she would reach out to me so we could talk things through. However, despite wanting to talk to her so much, there was a piece of me that fantasized endlessly about rudely crushing her if she did. I imagined her approaching me out of the blue, telling me she had made a mistake and wanted to be part of my life again; only so I could tell her to fuck off and see the spark extinguish from her eyes. Deep down, I knew I didn‚Äôt want to hurt her; I just wanted the emotional catharsis of her understanding and experiencing the pain I was feeling.

My rage reached a tipping point one night, when I got drunk and angrily sent her two messages in a fit of petulant rage.¬†*<I wish I never slept with you at the graduation party.> <Delete your photos of me. You don‚Äôt deserve to have those memories.>*

I cracked open another hard cider, laughing to myself at the pain I imagined the texts caused her. Five minutes later, my phone buzzed in my pocket and my heart skipped a beat when I read it.

*<I‚Äôd like to talk to you at some point when your available>*

Serotonin lit up my brain at the excitement of being able to talk to her again. Only now, I wasn‚Äôt angry. I was hopeful and ecstatic.¬†*<Where and when?>*

*<Tomorrow evening. Our place.>*

*<Sure>*¬†My heart raced at the thought of seeing her face again so soon. Not only that, but she referred to it as¬†***our***¬†place!¬†*‚ÄòShe must still see us living together!‚Äô,*¬†I thought gleefully. I found myself typing a little bit more.¬†*<I‚Äôve missed you!>*

I took off work the next day so I could get everything ready for Maddison‚Äôs arrival. I washed the dishes, vacuumed, dusted, threw out the empty cans and bottles that had accumulated around my bed, etc. I didn‚Äôt know what time she had planned on coming over, but I was guessing it wouldn‚Äôt be too late in the evening.

When I heard the knock at the door, it was close to 7:30 pm. I gulped back my anxiety, as I worked up the courage to open it.

Maddison looked as radiant as ever. Her hair was messy and unkempt. She was wearing grey hoodie and sweatpants. She wasn‚Äôt wearing any makeup. She was herself, as I alone knew her to be. I felt like I was seeing her again for the first time!

‚ÄúCome in!‚Äù I insisted. ‚ÄúAre you okay? How was your day?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. It was good. Let‚Äôs sit down.‚Äù

Maddison sat down on the couch. I sat next to her; not too close, but still a little hurt when she scooted further down from me.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs up?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúYou wanted to talk?‚Äù

Maddison eyed me up and down from two cushions away, unblinking and expressionless. ‚ÄúYou regret sleeping with me?‚Äù

I was taken aback. ‚ÄúI- I was- see, I was drinking last night, okay? I was frustrated and-‚Äù

‚ÄúI regret sleeping with you.‚Äù

I felt what little of my heart remained shattering inside my chest. My breathing got heavy, and I turned away from her so she couldn‚Äôt directly see my eyes go misty. ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù I managed to squeak out.

‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù Maddison said. I could hear the pain in her own voice as well.

‚ÄúIf you love me, why are you doing this?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI love you, but this is weird. You‚Äôve been acting weird for a long time and I don‚Äôt feel comfortable here anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about!‚Äù

‚ÄúReally!? The fucking ways you‚Äôve been acting manipulative towards me for months?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been acting manipulative?? You fucking left!‚Äù

‚ÄúTyler, you‚Äôve been playing fucking mind-games with me, and I hate it! You get weird when I hang out with my friends in the evenings! You over-misinterpret things I say as me starting fights! You spam messages at me whenever I don‚Äôt respond to you about anything and it‚Äôs weird!‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt understand what the fuck she was talking about or why she was trying to throw her actions back on me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about not coming home when I did. I just-‚Äù

‚ÄúTHE TREE IS NOT THE FUCKING PROBLEM, TYLER!!!‚Äù Maddison was practically shouting. ‚ÄúYou act like you‚Äôre fucking entitled to me, and I don‚Äôt know why you don‚Äôt see it!‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I don‚Äôt act like that!‚Äù I decided to try a different tactic. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bringing in more money!‚Äù I lied. ‚ÄúI just got offered a raise!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about money either. You‚Äôre not good for me. I can‚Äôt live the rest of my life like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have more to offer than before you left.‚Äù

She slid closer to me and her hand rested on mine. I pulled my arm away out of anger and immediately wished I could feel her hand again. That was probably going to be the last time I ever felt the love of my life‚Äôs hand.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll change.‚Äù I whimpered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be better. I‚Äôll find work. I‚Äôll give you the life you deserve.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou just said you got a raise.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll find better work. Much better.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about the life¬†*you*¬†deserve?‚Äù She asked. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not thinking about yourself, only me. This isn‚Äôt healthy! You can‚Äôt only force yourself to find something better on someone else‚Äôs behalf! And it‚Äôs not fair for you to live for someone YOU think expects you to be different.‚Äù Maddison stood up. ‚ÄúI want you to be happy. I want to be happy. This isn‚Äôt working out. You changed after we got married. It‚Äôs like you felt like you locked me in and the real you started coming out.‚Äù

I still didn‚Äôt know what she was on about. ‚ÄúYou want a divorce?‚Äù

‚ÄúEventually. When we can both handle it.‚Äù She walked in front of me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to sit in a divorce court now. I don‚Äôt think you do either. Right now, we just need to learn to exist away from each other. It‚Äôs for the best, I promise.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to live without you!‚Äù I was raising my voice now.

‚ÄúTyler, I need you to listen to me‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt live without you!‚Äù I screamed.

Maddison backed away slowly. ‚ÄúYes. You can‚Ä¶ You¬†*have*¬†been. You‚Äôre strong. You‚Äôre a smart person. But Tyler, this isn‚Äôt healthy‚Ä¶ Please try to understand.‚Äù She was backing towards the door.

‚ÄúWait!‚Äù I stood up. This was my last chance to convince her to stay. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go! Please!‚Äù I grabbed her wrist and tried to pull her back to me.

‚ÄúLet go!‚Äù Maddison struggled against my grasp. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this! Stop!‚Äù

Maddison tried pulling the door open. I pushed it shut with my free hand. ‚ÄúPlease just listen! I can‚Äôt say goodbye to you again!‚Äù

‚ÄúTyler! Let me the fuck go!‚Äù There was a loud clap, and I felt my face start to sting. Maddison and I both looked at each other shocked for a second, unsure if it had really happened, before she slapped me a second time. Then a third. ‚ÄúLet go! Don‚Äôt touch me! Let go! Let go! LET GO!!!‚Äù

My memory starts blurs here a bit, so I‚Äôll do my best to describe what happened next: I pulled Maddison away from the door with all my might, swung her around, and shoved her towards the coffee table. She stumbled across it, fell back and landed on her neck. She cried out as her limbs flailed and she tried to reorient herself. I didn‚Äôt give her the opportunity, closing the distance between her and I before grabbing her by the hair and slamming the back of her head into the floor. She stopped screaming, immediately dazed by what had happened. I had no intention of giving her the opportunity to resume, slamming her head once more before straddling her chest and beginning to rain blows upon her face.

This is where my memory completely fogs over. I don‚Äôt know how many times I punched her or for how long. I don‚Äôt remember when her begging faded into distorted gurgles, or when her body went limp. I just remember sitting over her‚Ä¶ My hand was the color of an unpainted brick wall. My entire body burned an icy cold. I stared straight ahead for what felt like an hour, before forcing myself to look down.

Maddison had no face. If one were to closely examine the pulverized fleshy mass, they might faintly recognize the distorted features of what had once been somebody‚Äôs only child.

I screamed. I ran to one of the drawers in the kitchen space and pulled out a large knife that I used to slice my arm open. I was trying my hardest to awaken from a nightmare I knew wasn‚Äôt the case. My blood pooled across the floor, and that combined with what I had done sent me into a shock which lasted for hours.

I sat next to Maddison, shaking and wishing the self-inflicted wound on my arm had been enough to kill me. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to look at her directly. I didn‚Äôt want to see what I had done to her face. Even still, I could very clearly see her legs sprawled out on the floor in front of me as I stared off into the distance.

Eventually, light shone through the window as day broke. I didn‚Äôt bother calling out of work again. I just stayed home with Maddison. I wasn‚Äôt hungry. I wasn‚Äôt tired. I didn‚Äôt even need to use the bathroom all day. I just sat on the floor next to her, doing my best not to look at her directly.

There were flies on Maddison.

After half a day of sitting with her, the shock of what had happened started wearing off. I cried. I bawled my eyes out. I had murdered my whole world, the only woman I would ever love, and life had no reason to continue. Yet, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to end it all. I think I deserved to die, but I couldn‚Äôt work up the courage to attempt it. I knew Maddison wouldn‚Äôt have wanted that for me. Even through everything, she had always loved me; she wouldn‚Äôt have wanted me to throw my life away alongside hers.

I realized it was only a matter of time before someone came to check in here and discovered what I had done. I decided that I needed to move her out of our apartment. To do that, I needed to reduce her weight and mass. The thought of intentionally damaging Maddison made me puke my empty stomach into the sink. I couldn‚Äôt leave her where she was though. ¬†

I took the kitchen knife I had used to slice my arm the night prior. Approaching Maddison‚Äôs body, I crouched next to her and closed my eyes. Clenched my teeth and put my hand on her cold, stiff chest. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù

I began to disassemble Maddison.

I put her limbs into a trash bag, along with all the trash which I hadn‚Äôt taken out in a week. At a glance, you couldn‚Äôt even tell that the bag contained Maddison‚Äôs severed appendages. I took the trash out to the dumpster in the parking lot, making sure to remove a few of the bags already in there and put them on top of my contribution. I had ensured that the first half of her would likely never be found, now I had to handle the second half.

I didn‚Äôt want to just throw Maddison‚Äôs torso and what remained of her head away. I felt like her heart and mind, the parts of her which most made up who she had been, deserved to be taken somewhere nice. Somewhere beautiful and quiet, where I can visit her still in the future. I couldn‚Äôt give her a proper burial or a grave-marker, but I could return her to nature. If say, her body were to feed something greater, would she not in some way live on?

I stuffed Maddison‚Äôs into a luggage bag and rolled her into my car. I put the case in the passenger seat, made sure it was buckled in nicely for her, and drove to the parking lot closest to the clearing. Nobody was around when I‚Äôd gotten there. Nobody saw me pull the luggage bag out of the passenger seat, extend the handle, and set off with it into the woods.

The forest was dead silent the entire walk. There were no evening birds chirping or squirrels chasing one another throughout the leaves. The wind lay dormant. The only sound amongst the trees, beneath the encroaching twilight, was me walking with the woman I loved.

When the clearing came into sight, I felt tears well up within my eyes. My chest constricted, and I felt the melancholic acceptance one feels upon the realization that a chapter in their life is forever over. My marriage to Maddison ended that day. She left me, returned, announced she‚Äôd wanted a divorce, then left again. She went missing. The police would inevitably check in, but I had no idea where she had gone. I love her, still. Completely and unconditionally, that will never change. I still feel angry though. My body still burns with the fire of her betrayal.

I leaned the bag against the Killing Tree, slowly unzipped it and gently pulled Maddison into my arms. Before I laid her to the dirt beside the gnarled cherry, I wanted to hold her one last time. It wasn‚Äôt the same. Maddison was cold and distant. I gently stroked her hair away from the pulp her eyes stared up at me through. Even though I loved her with all my heart, part of me hated her for abjuring her vows. She promised at the altar. I felt taken advantage of for believing her.

I laid her down and sat next to her one last time. My mind raced back to when Maddison had come here with me, and it caused that first fight almost a year prior. I did wish she would‚Äôve liked her final resting place more whilst alive.

Flies had already found their way to her, as quickly as mosquitoes had set upon me. Sunset had fallen now, and I stared up at the quickly darkening sky above. Or at least, what I could see of it through the branches and the leaves. Among them, the black cherries I had enjoyed for what felt like my whole life. Few things remain consistent. Someday, perhaps in my lifetime, the Killing Tree would die as well. Someday. But for the time being, I closed my eyes and drifted off to sleep once again. A deep sleep with dreams of cherries and a small apartment‚Ä¶ and eyes.

I have been dating this individual for 8 months now, and things are going well. We met on a dating app and I knew from her BIO that at the time she had a seven month old daughter, which I was completely fine with because im a few years older than her, she at the time was 21 and I was almost 25. She told me she was so sick of online dating because she kept getting ghosted left and right by people not realizing she had a kid. She also told me she wasnt even looking for someone to be a stepdad, but just that she wanted a partner. The thing is, I've always known I wanted to be a father. My own father started his parent-life as a step-father to my oldest sister. To this day, even after a divorce from her mother, having no legal ties, He considers her from his own flesh and blood, and I love and respect my father more than life itself.

My girlfriend knows this, she knows how passionate I am about not just being a father, but a good father: even if its just being a step parent at first, as I talk about how long I've loved my future child, even if they dont exist yet. She always reminds me how good of a father I would be. 

Her baby's daddy isn't really in the picture for many reasons, I wont name them all but the big ones being: he cheated on her while she was pregnant, enjoys gambling all his money away and consistently does hard drugs, ontop of many more issues that developed after he got her pregnant. To this day she cant even depend on him to help her with $20 for help with daycare. The baby does not see her birth father.

Heres the point of my rant here:
Despite her saying she wasnt looking for a step-dad. At the she start, she did often ask for help, but since then I have been without hesitation, taking care of both her and the baby as if the baby was my own, and she was the mother to a child of mine. I do not even think twice. If the baby needs dipers, got it, the baby needs food and supplies, got it, my house needs better baby proofing, got it, no questions asked. It is now to the point where when they are over to my house (3-4 nights a week) the only thing my girlfriend needs to do is change her diper and bathe her, and shes even told me she 'might have me change the babys diper soon' which is the only thing I've been hesitant on. I feel I have done very well stepping into the role of being a good co-parent, because I love her, and I've come to realize I love the child. I want the child to grow up with a father figure being someone who is present and cares deeply for a healthy and normal development. It didnt bother me at first that she didnt say thank you for much of what I do surrounding the baby and being a step parent. 

What hit the nail in my head:
June 15th was fathers day, and I always awake before my girlfriend and get up, make her coffee, and get breakfast stuff ready for the baby while they both sleep in more. But this day I decided to stay sleeping in next to her, and I can't describe the longing or some sort of desperation I felt as I awoke and looked at her sleeping, I felt like a kid waiting for their parents to get up on Christmas, just for a simple thank you, a thank you for what you do for us. And yes, I know the baby isn't mine, and I was in no way expecting a huge fathers day blowout because its only been 8 months. But I didnt get a single thank you for what you do the entire day.

Not to be too dramatic but,
I felt like my heart and soul was a burning candle, and at the end of the day the wick was gone, and I was a pool of wax in a mess on the table. I feel like a cup thats pouring into a jar, and the jar is over flowing onto the floor, and none ever goes back into the cup.

Theres so much more on details but I dont want to give up too many personal stuff. I just want someone to please tell me if im being delusional or not.

I guess I just feel under appreciated, mislead and used.",4,1750203233.0,AITAH,18,0.75,False

Honestly though, I was at the point where I was having migraines almost daily and sometimes for weeks straight. I couldn't find an overall cause, and the hormonal ones were absolutely horrendous. I have a bit of health anxiety I guess so I am always scared to take prescription medication, especially with the awful side effects reported by migraine medications.


Thinking about it and reflecting back, I realized my migraines have been worse in the last 2 years specifically. So I thought, what changed around 2 years ago? And I realized I had quit smoking pot exactly two years ago. (I had been smoking chronically for about 20 years for recreational purposes prior to quitting)


Headed out to dispensary, bought a pre-roll. Lit it up and my migraine, which I was on day 6 of, fucking vanished from one hit. I cried tears of relief. Now ... I can't say it always works that well, especially because you do build a tolerance to it, but let me tell you smoking chronically again has cured, as I mentioned in title, approx 95% of my migraines. EVEN THE HORMONAL ONES. The last two months I haven't gotten the nasty hormonal headache AT ALL. 


Everyone's different, but what works for me is having a bong hit first thing in the morning, and then go chronic all evening on it. I prefer sativas to indicate because I like the high more, it's more giggly and energetic. But if you have trouble sleeping, indica is the strain you want. If I feel a migraine coming on and I'm able to smoke, my magic combo is black coffee, Tylenol x2, and a bong rip. (I can't take Advil or anti-inflammatories cause of my guts so my only recourse is Tylenol drug-wise).


Anyways I'm sure it won't work for everyone because what does, but if my experience can help anyone else out then I'm grateful üôè ",0,1750202838.0,migraine,6,0.5,False

Looking for advice.,"Looking for something advice from the lovely people on this sub.. my husband (35) and I (34) have been TTC for 9 months. My little sister has recently gone through IVF so I‚Äôve been a little anxious about my own journey. Sorry this is long but appreciate advice and hopefully this is okay to post here!

My husband used to smoke weed regularly, take Adderall daily, and drank alcohol quite regularly. Last Nov., he cut out weed and the Adderall completely and cut way back on the drinking. Otherwise, he is quite healthy as in he works out 4-5 days per week, eats healthy (mostly whole foods), is a healthy weight, wears cotton boxers, avoids other toxins besides alc and weed. He had a SA done in March to check where he was at and it came back with:
- 3 ML volume 
- 37.5 mil/ML concentration 
- 71% motility
- 1% morphology

He also had a blood test and ultrasound. His testosterone and other levels were great but he did have one small varicocle that the urologist said wasn‚Äôt worth addressing, because it wouldn‚Äôt impact morphology. He said even with the 1% we still had 86% chance of conceiving unassisted within our first year and he didn‚Äôt seem concerned. This was 4 weeks ago as we had to wait while for an appt to review the ultrasound results. 

He did recommend making some more lifestyle changes and getting another SA in 3 months. My husband cut down on caffeine to 2 cups of coffee per day (he doesn‚Äôt want to reduce more than that), focused on better sleep, took all the recommended supps for sperm health. He iced his testicles a bit but not often. The second SA was done last week and came back with:
- 3.5 Ml volume
- 45 mil/ML concentration 
- 57% motility
- 1% morphology 

The urologist said essentially nothing has changed but is now saying we only have 60-70% likelihood of conceiving and that we should consider IVF. This is a total change from 4 weeks ago where he wasn‚Äôt concerned and was cautiously optimistic we could conceive in a year, assuming there is nothing going on with me.

He said there are no other tests we can do, not DNA fragmentation, and that looking into what is abnormal about the sperm would require us to select the IVF route. He also said he wouldn‚Äôt recommend IUI, although we don‚Äôt know what is abnormal about the sperm. 

I have not started any tests but have an appt. scheduled with a new OB for fertility assessment next week. My current OB is resistant to testing before one year and is a bit too nonchalant. I did have another new patient appt with an OB in the same system as the urologist in February. He mentioned IVF in our first appt without any tests from myself or my husband. I didn‚Äôt go back to this OB for several reasons. 

I don‚Äôt want to be naive and think we don‚Äôt need IVF, because I understand that is a possibility. Obviously he‚Äôs not forcing this but what seemed to not be a concern a few weeks ago is suddenly candidacy for IVF.

I guess I‚Äôm looking for thoughts and advice as it suddenly feels like IVF is being pushed without other options and we‚Äôre not even at that standard 12 month mark? Should we get another opinion or find a diff urologist?

We are going to keep trying for awhile but trying to decide a plan of action for the future in case we‚Äôre not successful.

Yung kapatid ng tita ko buntis at malapit na din manganak. Nung gabi na un mga bandang hating gabi nagising kaming lahat sa ingay na parang tunog ng butiki pero ang lakas niya. Lahat ng mga lalake dun sa bahay bumangon at binuksan ung mga ilaw tapos lumabas sila ng bahay para daw bugawin ung tiktik. Kahit nababasa at naririnig ko na ung mga istorya tungkol sa tiktik, first time kong maexperience un. Mga isang oras din un tapos ung mga pinsan kong mas bata sakin natatakot na pero andun lang kami sa pinaka sala nila hanggang mawala na ung ingay.

Story 2:

Nung gumagayak na kami pauwi, pinahanap sakin ng tita ko ung isa kong pinsan kasi dun kami maliligo sa tuktok ng bundok. Bumaba ako dun sa barrio kasi alam ko dun siya nakikipag laro pero di ko siya nakita dun, sabi nung mga kalaro niya umakyat na daw kaya umakyat na din ako. Habang paakyat ako dun sa tuktok ng bundok naaninagan ko siya tumatakbo paakyat (ung daanan paakyat ng tuktok is mabangin at manipis lang ung maaapakan mo parang typical lang na trail sa gilid ng bundok) tinawag ko siya pero di siya lumingon hanggang di ko na siya inabutan. Pag akyat ko sa tuktok, tinanong ako ng tita ko kung asan na siya, sabi ko nauna na sakin dito tumatakbo pa nga tapos tinatawag ko di naman nalingon. Tapos after mga ilang minuto, dumating na siya kasama ung kuya ng tita ko. Galing daw silang lawa namingwit ng isda. Namutla tita ko nung narinig un at pinaghubad kaming dalawa ng pinsan ko ng damit at sinunog nila un tapos dun na lang kami pinaligo sa barrio sa baba ng bundok.

Ito ung una't huling beses naming pumunta ng IloIlo kahit matatanda na kami at alam ko ung lupa nila dun sa bundok binenta na nila kasi marami na daw di maexplain na nangyayari dun.

A few days later, we planned a second date‚Äîwe hit the beach, got some drinks, grabbed food, and then went back to my place.

When she used my bathroom before leaving, she accidentally left her sunglasses. I texted her a picture of them, and when she came back up to grab them, I jokingly told her she might as well stay a bit longer. She agreed, I took a quick shower, and when I came out, she was already under the blanket in my bed. I joined her, we cuddled, and eventually ended up having sex‚Äîtwice.

The next day, I realized she had also left her ID and debit card in my wallet from the day before. She came by to pick them up and even offered me food (which I declined since I was on my way to work). I gave her a fist bump goodbye and that was that,Lol (i know).

A couple of days later, I texted her saying we should hang out again‚Äîspecifically go to the arcade‚Äîand asked what days she was free. She took about two hours to respond but was super playful and open when she did. We flirted and teased each other while making the plans.

now it‚Äôs been two days, and our plans are set for thursday but I haven‚Äôt heard anything from her. I‚Äôm used to girls texting me like, ‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù or checking in more/trying to talk to me in between dates, but she hasn‚Äôt been doing that at all.

My question is:
Is this just her pace, or is her interest lower than I thought? Should I pull back and let her reach out? Or just chill, am I overthinking? I like women who show they want me around.

1le1wst,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1le1wst/i_waited_too_long/,I waited too long,"In my last relationship, me and my ex got together when I was going through a very tough time mentally. I had been struggling with severe depression during the pandemic, but developed a crush on her after seeing her pretty frequently at my favorite coffee shop. When we got together, it felt like a magical thing.

However, from the first few months, I noticed that we had some real communication issues. She would go completely silent whenever I would try to bring something up to her either about our relationship or that I was going through personally.

After I graduated, I started working in a really stressful industry, which led me to an even worse place mentally. I was in no way healthy enough to be in a relationship, but when she graduated, she was planning on moving to the same city as me so we decided to move in together.  

The communication issues continued, and my mental health stayed the same. I was very lost and unhappy, and I think we definitely became codependent on one another as we took on adult life.

From the time we moved in together, I noticed she started to make demeaning comments about my hobbies and interest, and talked down to me like I was stupid. If I brought up something she had done that hurt me she would turn it around and make me feel bad about it. 

I started to have doubts about the relationship, but with my mental health getting worse, I didn‚Äôt think I had the right to break up with her considering how she had stayed with me during some very hard times. I also recognize that I was not showing up in the relationship in many ways like I should, and so I‚Äôve viewed a lot of our issues as a product of my own inability to get healthier.

We had made plans to get married and moved to a new city when she graduated grad school, but by the time she graduated, I felt like we didn‚Äôt really have much of a connection left. 

I had been having conversations with friends about whether I should break up with her for months. Finally, I made the decision to initiate the conversation that led to us breaking up earlier this year. 

I really wish I would‚Äôve stood up for myself sooner and trusted my instincts that the relationship wasn‚Äôt working. I also tried to make the breakup seem very mutual because I didn‚Äôt feel like I had the right to break up with somebody who had their life more together than me.

1le1wiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Fabulous-Resort1917/comments/1le1wiw/tarot_reading_faq/,Tarot Reading FAQ,"Before getting a reading from me, please understand that I am human and take the time to pull cards for every reading. Please be respectful of what you ask, as I do not sugarcoat what I am being shown for you. I will do my best to complete every single one within 24-72 hours.

Please read the FAQ before booking a reading with me or contacting me for a reading.



***What type of readings do you not accept?*** 

There are specific readings that I will not do under any circumstances. Those are sexual, pregnancy, legal, financial, health, including deaths, what your future partner would look like, and mediumship.



***What is the delivery process like?*** 

Every reading that is requested, except live chat readings, is delivered within 24-72 hours from when the [form](#page-tbuf55t0) is submitted. It will usually be in PDF format, but in some cases, it may not be required. Unless there is an overflow of requests or something happens to me, a notification will be sent.

  
***Do I pay before or after the reading?***

All paid readings must be paid in full, with the form request completed, before I begin working on your reading.  

  
***What forms of payment do you accept?***

I currently accept PayPal and [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/insightfulwishes). I may take other forms of payment that you are comfortable using, such as Cash App and Venmo. Please get in touch with me beforehand.

  
***What is your refund policy?***

**All readings are nonrefundable.** I give my time and energy to do in-depth readings. Please be sure to respect my time and efforts in answering your questions to the best of my ability.

*If you are unsure about my abilities, you can request 1 sample reading per person. Every sample reading will consist of 1 question and a short description of the card(s) that are pulled. Pictures of cards are optional, and you will need to request them in advance.* 

*I also post free readings on here at times, or you can ask for one.*



***Why were my question(s) answered about me and not about the person(s) I asked about?***

There are different reasons, but I include this question because it does and can happen. I am in no way avoiding your question; I am simply reading what I am shown on the cards. If your question is answered in this manner, please be aware that there is something that requires your attention or focus first to see the bigger picture regarding your question. I would be more than happy to review what I saw on the cards and their meanings with you. 



***Do you do recorded readings or live video readings?***

No, I currently do not do recorded or video sessions. This may change in the future, though.

  
***What decks do you use when reading Tarot?***

I use my decks that I have purchased and have a connection with. I have a total of five decks, 3 tarot decks, 1 oracle (personal use), and the Hidden Truth v2 deck. The decks that I typically use when reading for others are the Tarot Mucha deck and The White Numen, a Sacred Animal Tarot deck. Sometimes, I would use The Hidden Truth v2 when asked about feelings of others, but typically will use the Tarot Mucha deck for the majority of the readings.

  
***Are you able to include timeframes in the readings?***

Yes, I can provide an approximate timeframe, but please keep in mind that time is a concept that is constantly changing. Any minor change that you or the other person makes **CAN** alter the timeframe that is given. There are factors to consider, such as Mother Nature and free will, among others, that can alter timeframes. Please keep that in mind when you ask any time-based questions. 

  
***Do you send pictures of the cards that were pulled?***

I sometimes send pictures of the cards pulled, and if there is room, the way they were laid out. You can certainly ask for a picture! 

Please keep in mind that some of my decks have slightly revealing images on the cards that I would need to cover with sticky notes first, before sending a picture. 



***Will there be any changes here?***

Yes, there will be changes in the future for prices and what I offer. I am planning to add other services, in addition to tarot readings, and acquire a new oracle deck for non-personal use, including additional questions here.



If you have made it to the end, please include your favorite color in the chat for readings. Thank you! ",1,1750202037.0,u_Fabulous-Resort1917,0,1.0,False
1le1vtu,https://www.reddit.com/r/eShoppingUSA/comments/1le1vtu/pillow_for_neck_pain_hotelquality_sleep_fixed_it/,Pillow for Neck Pain? Hotel-Quality Sleep Fixed It!,"**Title:** Pillow Problems? This Hotel-Quality Pillow Fixed My Sleep (Best Pillow for Neck Pain Relief!)

Okay, Reddit, I've got to share my recent sleep epiphany.  For years, I've struggled with sleep.  Tossing and turning, waking up with a stiff neck ‚Äì the whole nine yards.  I've tried countless pillows: memory foam, down, feather, you name it.  Nothing seemed to truly work. I was always tired, constantly reaching for that extra cup of coffee just to function.  It was affecting my work, my relationships, everything.  Honestly, the frustration was overwhelming.  I even tried those fancy relaxation techniques and sleep aids, but nothing gave me lasting relief.

Then, I stumbled upon this pillow ‚Äì the Starry Sleep Pillow. I know, I know, another pillow?  But trust me on this one.  The description mentioned ""hotel-quality sleep,"" which sounded a bit over-the-top, but I was desperate.  The ergonomic design immediately stood out; it's different from any pillow I've ever seen.  It‚Äôs all about how it supports your neck and spine.  The filling feels unique, airy but supportive ‚Äì  I think they said something about advanced cooling technology to prevent overheating.  And let me tell you, that's a game changer (sorry, I had to!). I'm usually a hot sleeper, but with this, I stay cool all night.

The first night was‚Ä¶amazing. I actually fell asleep quickly, which hasn‚Äôt happened in years!  I woke up feeling refreshed and, get this, my neck didn't hurt!  That alone was worth the price.   Over the next few weeks, I noticed a significant improvement in my sleep quality.  I'm falling asleep faster, staying asleep longer, and waking up feeling much more rested.  My energy levels are way up ‚Äì I've even started exercising more,  which is a huge win.  I'm more productive at work and have even noticed my mood is much improved.  

I'm not going to lie, it‚Äôs a bit of an investment, but considering how much money I was potentially wasting on sleep aids and how much more productive I am now, it‚Äôs already paying off.  I'm not exaggerating when I say this pillow has been a life-changer. It solved a major problem in my life - the problem of not getting enough restful sleep. It‚Äôs one of those things I wish I'd bought sooner.

I found it on ursupermart.com, if you're curious.  Seriously, if you‚Äôre battling sleep issues, or just want to upgrade your sleep experience, check it out. This is the best pillow for neck pain relief I've ever used, and I've tried a lot.  It's noticeably different from other memory foam pillows I've owned because it just stays cool and comfortable. I've found my sweet spot ‚Äì no more tossing and turning, no more morning neck pain!  I feel like I finally understand what ""hotel-quality sleep"" actually means.  It's like a little slice of luxury in my own bedroom.üò¥


Here‚Äôs the link if you're interested in seeing more details about the Starry Sleep Pillow: https://go.ursupermart.com/dx5dVi

Seriously, you guys.  Check it out.  If you struggle with getting a good night's sleep (and let's be honest, who doesn't sometimes?), this pillow might just be your new best friend.  Plus, waking up feeling this good is such a confidence boost!  No more dragging myself out of bed ‚Äì  I'm actually excited to start my day now. I've got my energy back and I'm enjoying a better quality of life, all thanks to a pillow.  Who knew?  I‚Äôm thinking about buying another one as a gift for my mom.  She's always complaining about her neck!  Highly recommend. üëç

So nimekumbuka nikiwa ryma (I was in a public mixed school) I met a former classmate (friend is a strong word) mwenye tulikuwa na yeye shule moja then aka transfer hapo class 6. I enrolled in the school I found him a year later (coincidentally) on class 7. Let's call this guy James. So James based on vile nilimjua the time nilikuwa chuo moja na yeye, well a good name to describe him is a narcissist and a very intelligent one. 

So fast foward some months later tukiwa chuo (sa ukiwa new comer you ain't that familiar with the lingo) plus I was an easy guy to pick on since I was a quiet guy. Anyways back to the story sa Kuna day flani nilikuwa na explore shule kidogo Kidogo kutembea dorm zingine kubangaiza just to be familiar with the environment and I stumbled upon io dorm James hudoz. 

So this guy starts interrogating me like ""Unado nini huku"" and some other nonsensical questions kama zile za makarao. So before nipitie dorm ya uyu jamaa, nilikuwa nimetembea dorm zingine. So evening ikafika and allegedly one dorm nilitembea kuna box ya mtu ilipigwa butterfly and there is some guy who ID'd me and since I was the new face around, I was the primary suspect. 

Nikapapelekwa kwa dorm captain and further interrogations were made at me and akaniuliza kama kuna msee aliniona before to prove my innocence and the first guy that came to mind was James. So James gets summoned na dorm captain and Pia yeye akaulizwa maswali kadhaa kunihusu. Now the thing that was stolen was milk, so akaulizwa kama aliniona kama aliniona nikibeba maziwa and akasema zae. Now  this guy started saying ""Labda alificha before nimwone, idk"" and since wewe ni suspect, hauna haki ya kuongea. 

So ilibidi vijana wengine wabebe box yangu kutoka dorm yangu hadi io dorm ya crime scene ndo niifungulie hapo. Long story short, Hawakupata kitu ya maana. Case closed. Now this guy, James confronts me after io case and starts yapping ati oooh mbona umetaja Jina yangu blah blah blah unajua mimi ni nani hocus pocus enda muulize huyu jamaa nilimfanyia nini fairy tales and well if that guy alikuwa ananichukia I guess alipata something to keep the fire of hatred burning. 

From that day hatukupelekana vizuri hadi tumalize. I didn't hold anything against the guy, I just let him be. He started finding the slightest damaging info about me and press it to his advantage. The kind that ati mode lakini confront saa ya teo and starts spreading word that im a copycat ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I‚Äôm a 21-year-old mechanical engineering student from the West Flanders region of Belgium‚Äîright in the heart of where a lot of WWI (and WWII) history took place.
Even though I‚Äôm not a historian or certified guide, I‚Äôve always been passionate about the history of the region, especially the World Wars.

I‚Äôve always found it kind of heartwarming to see people from as far as North America travel all the way here to explore their historical roots or just learn about the events that shaped the world. So I thought I‚Äôd put this idea out there:
*If you‚Äôre visiting West Flanders and want to connect with a local‚Äî*
‚Äîmaybe for a walk around a site, visiting a museum together, or just having a meal or coffee while chatting about the history and the region‚ÄîI‚Äôd be happy to meet up if our schedules align.
I‚Äôm not offering this as a paid guide or professional service‚Äîjust as a local who enjoys meeting new people and talking about history, and maybe helping someone get a bit more out of their visit.
Would anyone here actually be interested in something like this?And if you‚Äôve done something similar while traveling‚Äîdid it enhance your trip?
Open to feedback, ideas, or even connecting with people planning to visit this summer or later. I‚Äôll only be available from time to time (student life is busy), but I‚Äôd love to make this a small thing on the side.

One thing led to another he ended up having full access to their backend.

According to him, he could see every order ever placed, along with user details, phone numbers, and delivery addresses. And above that he had WRITE access to the entire database which meant he could place fake orders, change prices, issue coupons, or even delete users if he wanted to.

1le1qu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1le1qu2/stuck_l/,Stuck :L,"Hey all,

So little bit of exposition, so I've (30M) been poly since Uni where I was in a three way relationship, I dated both of them and me in turn, believe the term is throuple? Or however it's spelt but me (16M) and (17M + 16F). Anyway long story short I ended up hurting, like BAD, was manipulated into substance abuse under the guise of just having a good time, eventually kinda broke free and started to turn my life around, tried to help them but was cut out without my knowledge till it was cut and done so to speak. Cheating etc

Seriously messed me up, all over the course of only about three years, from finding myself, enjoying the love, an outside source taking hold then the quick tumble if that makes sense.

Tried to confide in my uni friends but for one reason or another I was cut off, some immediately became kinda homophobic or called me a disgrace etc, apparently not friends at all. Was a bit of a shit show to say the least... So what did I do? Did the most unhealthy thing and hid it, wrote it off like a crashed car and just reinvented myself as the loner Pansexual who buried his head in his work.

Skip to me being 21, met my now fiance and an absolute Gem, was still hiding my true self in a self defence way, subconsciously I know I was terrified of being judged again so hid the full truth (Was I wrong? 100% but what's done is done) SO! I came out as Poly to her a week or so ago, had a long discussion with my Mum who apparently knew from the get go and said she was happy I'd finally been true to myself.

Didn't start well, could argue it still isn't but I only have myself to blame for that, my own fault for not dealing with past trauma and just burying it... Done it my whole life, comes from being in a military family, very old fashioned views etc, was really surprised my Mum was as openly accepting as she was, but guess apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

Now I'm stuck, the concept to my fiance is alien and I get that. I'm really trying to explain the whole deal that my variant of Poly as I'd call it is that it's not that she's not enough, nor will she ever be not enough. But that I have so much love to give that if anyone ever did click with me on the same level as her I'd love to not share the love but expand the love?? I'm a very emotional person, in the way that I will go the extra mile to make someone feel valued. 

Waitress at a BnB getting hassled by a mountain of people because coffee machine was broken? Tipped her ¬£30 and told her she was doing a fantastic job and not everyone was an ass. Old man at my work was devastated on the passing of his wife and wanted all the photos from a dead laptop, costs about ¬£200 for data retrieval, did it for free because he couldn't even get his card out of his wallet due to his hands shaking to much.... That's the type of person I am if that gives clarity.

Anyway, I don't know, it's odd being this way inclined for years(Poly)  but never talking to other people about it, hiding it from people then just kinda breaking down after so many years of hiding it.

Am I the idiot? 100% in my opinion, I should have just talked to someone and the issues I now face are my own doing. I've never really been able to blame others or be annoyed for long periods of time.

Anyway I'm rambling, but has anyone else had a similar situation? How did you express your poly side without sounding like you just want to replace something with something else?

I have no desire to leave my fiance, nor will I ever, she's that rare sort of person I don't meet often... I'd like to meet someone else that gels with me down the line BUT early days and even then may never happen.

Just really struggling. We're going to see a couples councilor so that's a start I think but any input if any would be amazing, or failing that just people to talk to in all honesty.",1,1750201611.0,polyamory,1,1.0,False

Hi r/roadtrip! Me and my best friend are driving from Philadelphia, PA to Boulder, CO (one way). We‚Äôll be leaving August 20th and arriving in Boulder the 22nd. We‚Äôre planning to take I-76 W and I-70 W.

Currently browsing [roadsideamerica.com](http://roadsideamerica.com) and [atlasobscura.com](http://atlasobscura.com). Neither of us have planned a road trip before, so we‚Äôre looking for advice on things to do.

If anyone has any recommendations near our route please drop some suggestions! This is just a list of stuff we‚Äôre particularly interested in :)

* **Culture**: Local attractions, art events/shops, historic museums/monuments
* **Nature**: National parks, landmarks, animal sanctuaries
* **Roadside attractions**: Funny/strange things that make you say ‚ÄúWow, only in \_\_\_\_\_.‚Äù¬†
* **Food and drink**: Coffee shops/bakeries, candy shops, cheese shops, local must-haves (we‚Äôre both vegetarian)

Hi there! I hope everyone is having a good week, a sunny prelude for the upcoming summer solstice ‚òÄÔ∏è

24 hr raffle for ‚Äòready for summer‚Äô 15 by our beloved artist u/ghostbeary

‚òÄÔ∏è For entry (1) comment a summer themed mash and (2) tell me what your favorite summertime activity is ‚òÄÔ∏è‚õ±Ô∏èüåäüëôüêö ü©±‚òÄÔ∏èü§ç üåÖ

 I‚Äôll share. I love going to outdoor sunset music festivals on the beach, especially rhythm and blues. I also love taking my two little angels to local heritage festivals. Our neighboring city is home to many annual heritage festivals including Polish, Irish, Russian, German, Greek and Pennsylvania Dutch/Scandinavian. 

A favorite lazy summer pastime is firing up the grill and chilling on the back deck with a lounge chair and iced coffee, watching the kids and dogs run through the sprinklers. Summer is also a wonderful opportunity to teach the little ones about flower and vegetable gardens. 

‚òÄÔ∏èPlease do not enter if you already have ‚Äòready for summer‚Äô. No age/karma requirement. I‚Äôll notify our winner on this post in approximately 24 hours. Happy mashing!
