I live a 15min walk from my job. My umbrella was electrocuting me, i was soaked, the lighting struck majorly 5 times within 15ft of me within 2mins and I had 2 random guys offer me a ride, I told the first one no because he was sketchy asf and then he stops IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAMN ROAD and he's like hey are you sure and I'm like yeah and there's a damn school bus going way too fast about to plow into his ass 😃 all I could think is oh my god if that bus hits him he's going to die. I fully believed I saved sketchy guys life. This weather, the speed that bus was going, the four ways light being broken, that would've fucking killed him. Second dude in a truck offered me a ride I turned him down the first time, got electrocuted again with the lighting alot closer and that was the 4th strike, screamed ACTUALLY YES. Crossed the road and got in. He was very kind, he said it was probably best I trusted my gut about the first one that he was sketchy sounding to him too. He held a convo the whole short drive and I eventually got to work safely. Needless to say I think it's best I trusted the second guy and not the first. Getting in his truck went against every single thing I've ever learned, everything in me was panicking. Something I'd never do but I was scared. Weather seemed more terrifying than his front seat. electrocuted by my umbrella with lighting striking 5 times in a row within 2mins of each other while im 8mins away from work literally running because I thought if I closed the umbrella and let it dangle it would electrocute me less but i didn't have time to put my jacket on so i came to the conclusion that running is the best option. I spent the whole shift thinking about it all. Everything was so sudden and it felt like it all happened at the same time. The storm hit terribly and very suddenly. I wasn't running until after the bus incident. I can't even tell you the conversation we had because I was just frozen and couldn't comprehend half of what he said. I truly have never felt such fear and anxiety, I know full and well now that I was thinking properly but something about it all stills fills me with fear. My coworkers were very nice about it aswell, said they felt bad and one even made me a coffee lol I held it together for my shift but I got home 3 hours ago and I haven't been able to do anything but think about it all.


Sorry this is so long and ranty. I don't have anyone I feel like I could tell this to and feel reasonable. I don't know what else I was supposed to do but I feel like other people would assume they would make a different decision. It was too late to turn around or call in, i was already so close to the diner but I couldn't see it anymore and it felt like I was running in slow motion. It really truly rattled me. I don't know if I'll get this off my mind for awhile. ",1,1743826216.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

**Skilled Drain Cleaning in Levittown – Johnny Rooter’s Leak Detection & Repair Services**                                                                          

Picture this: You’re about to start your morning routine, but instead of a smooth-flowing sink or shower, you're faced with standing water. A clogged drain is the last thing anyone wants to deal with, right? That’s where **Johnny Rooter Plumbing** comes in! If you’re in **Levittown**, we offer top-notch **drain cleaning, leak detection, and repair services** to keep your home running smoothly.

In this guide, we’ll dive into the importance of professional drain cleaning, the dangers of hidden leaks, and how **Johnny Rooter Plumbing** can save you time, money, and frustration.

**Introduction – The Hidden Dangers Lurking in Your Pipes**

**Why Plumbing Maintenance Should Be a Top Priority**

When was the last time you thought about your plumbing system? If you’re like most homeowners, probably not until something went wrong. Unfortunately, plumbing issues tend to creep up when you least expect them – and they often start in places you can't even see. Behind your walls and under your floors, hidden leaks can silently damage your home, and drains can become breeding grounds for bacteria and mold.

Regular plumbing maintenance isn't just a good idea – it’s essential. Neglecting your pipes can lead to clogs, water damage, sky-high utility bills, and even structural issues. And in Levittown, where homes range from historic to newly built, the risk of plumbing issues varies just as widely. That's why it’s crucial to work with a professional plumbing team that understands the local landscape and challenges.

**The Importance of Drain Cleaning**

**How Clogged Drains Affect Your Home**

Let’s get one thing straight: clogged drains are *not* just a minor inconvenience. Over time, even a small blockage can lead to major issues. Backups, foul odors, water stains, and even flooding can result from neglected drains. If you've ever had water overflow from your sink or tub, you know the frustration—and mess—it brings.

Clogs are often caused by everyday habits—pouring grease down the sink, flushing paper towels, or even just regular soap scum and hair buildup. In Levittown homes, especially older ones, outdated piping can make your plumbing even more vulnerable. Left untreated, that slow-draining sink could lead to a cracked pipe or a flooded basement.

Cleaning your drains regularly helps:

* Prevent blockages and backups
* Improve water flow and pressure
* Reduce the risk of mold and mildew
* Eliminate gurgling noises and foul smells

**Signs It’s Time to Clean Your Drains**

Not sure if you need drain cleaning? Watch out for these red flags:

* **Slow-draining sinks or tubs**
* **Standing water**
* **Gurgling sounds**
* **Unpleasant odors coming from drains**
* **Water backing up into other fixtures**

If you're dealing with any of the above, it's time to call the pros. Ignoring these signs can make the problem worse—and much more expensive to fix.

**DIY Drain Cleaning vs. Professional Services**

Sure, you can try a plunger or a store-bought drain cleaner—but be careful. Many over-the-counter drain cleaners use harsh chemicals that can damage your pipes over time. Plus, they often only offer a temporary fix.

At Johnny Rooter Plumbing, we use:

* **Hydro-jetting:** A high-pressure water method that clears out the toughest blockages.
* **Video camera inspections:** To pinpoint exactly where the clog is.
* **Snaking and rodding:** For precision removal of buildup without damaging your pipes.

Professional drain cleaning not only fixes the issue—it prevents future problems. And with us, you get long-term results and peace of mind.

**Leak Detection – The Silent Problem**

**Common Causes of Household Leaks**

Leaks are sneaky. They often go unnoticed for weeks—or even months—until they’ve caused serious damage. Some of the most common culprits include:

* **Worn-out pipe joints**
* **Cracked or corroded pipes**
* **Damaged seals on fixtures**
* **Excessive water pressure**
* **Root intrusion into underground pipes**

Older homes in Levittown are particularly at risk, especially if they still have galvanized steel plumbing or original copper lines. Even small pinhole leaks can ruin drywall, warp floors, and cause mold infestations if ignored.

**Why Early Detection Matters**

Catching leaks early is crucial for both your wallet and your home. A leak the size of a pinhole can waste **over 90 gallons of water a day**. That’s not just bad for the environment—it’s bad for your bank account.

More importantly, undetected leaks can:

* Destroy drywall and flooring
* Compromise your home's foundation
* Create the perfect environment for mold and mildew
* Attract pests like termites or cockroaches

With **early detection**, you save money, reduce waste, and protect your home’s structural integrity.

**Technology Used by Johnny Rooter for Leak Detection**

We don’t guess—we use **advanced tools** to locate leaks with pinpoint accuracy. Our arsenal includes:

* **Acoustic leak detectors** to hear even the faintest drips
* **Infrared cameras** to detect moisture behind walls
* **Pressure testing systems** to check for drops in water pressure
* **Pipe inspection cameras** to visually confirm damage

This high-tech approach means fewer holes in your walls and faster, more accurate repairs.

**Step-by-Step Process for Drain Cleaning**

We take pride in our **thorough, efficient, and effective** approach to drain cleaning. Here’s a breakdown of what you can expect when you schedule with Johnny Rooter Plumbing:

1. **Initial Assessment:** We start by listening. What symptoms are you noticing? Is it one sink or your whole house? This helps us narrow down the issue.
2. **Camera Inspection:** Our high-resolution drain cameras go inside your pipes to locate the blockage and identify the cause—whether it’s grease, tree roots, or debris buildup.
3. **Cleaning Method Selection:** Based on the inspection, we choose the most effective method:
   * Snaking for minor clogs
   * Hydro-jetting for stubborn blockages
   * Manual extraction if foreign objects are found
4. **Flush & Test:** After clearing the blockage, we thoroughly flush the system to ensure everything flows smoothly.
5. **Final Review:** We walk you through what we found and share tips for keeping your drains clean.

This step-by-step approach minimizes guesswork and ensures a job done right the first time.

**Our Leak Detection Workflow**

Leak detection isn’t just about spotting water on the floor. It’s about using **state-of-the-art technology** to uncover issues you can’t see.

Here’s how we handle it:

1. **Visual & Verbal Clues:** We ask questions, inspect common leak zones, and check water meter readings for unusual spikes.
2. **Infrared & Acoustic Tools:** These allow us to detect leaks behind walls, beneath floors, and even under concrete slabs.
3. **Camera Inspections:** Especially for underground pipes or wall systems, we use flexible camera tools to confirm damage and pinpoint its location.
4. **Detailed Report & Plan:** Once we find the leak, we provide a full explanation and multiple repair options—always with your budget in mind.
5. **Swift, Non-Invasive Repair:** We aim to keep the repair process as clean and disruption-free as possible. Many minor leaks can be resolved the same day.

**Preventative Maintenance Tips for Homeowners**

**Weekly and Monthly Plumbing Checklist**

Want to avoid costly plumbing disasters? A little maintenance goes a long way. Here’s a simple checklist to keep your system running smoothly:

**Weekly:**

* Run hot water down bathroom and kitchen sinks
* Check for puddles or damp spots under sinks
* Inspect washing machine hoses for bulges or leaks

**Monthly:**

* Pour a mixture of vinegar and baking soda down your drains to break up buildup
* Clean hair catchers in showers and tubs
* Check toilet tanks and bowls for cracks or leaks
* Examine exposed pipes for signs of corrosion or moisture

**What to Avoid Putting Down the Drain**

Not all waste is created equal. Here’s a list of items you should *never* send down the drain:

🚫 Grease and cooking oils  
🚫 Coffee grounds  
🚫 Eggshells  
🚫 Pasta and rice (they expand!)  
🚫 Flushable wipes (they’re *not* really flushable)  
🚫 Paint, chemicals, or solvents

Educating your family on what not to flush or drain can save you hundreds—if not thousands—of dollars in future repairs.

**When to Call the Pros**

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, problems arise. Call Johnny Rooter Plumbing if:

* You hear strange noises (gurgling, banging)
* Your water pressure suddenly drops

**Cost Guide: Drain Cleaning & Leak Repair in Levittown**

**What Influences the Price?**

Plumbing isn’t a one-size-fits-all service, and the same goes for pricing. The cost of[ **drain cleaning and leak detection in Levittown**](https://johnnyrooterny.com/drain-repair-and-installation/) can vary depending on several key factors:

* **Severity of the issue:** A minor clog will naturally cost less than a deep-rooted blockage requiring hydro-jetting or pipe replacement.
* **Accessibility:** Leaks inside walls, ceilings, or under concrete slabs are more time-consuming and labor-intensive to address.
* **Type of repair needed:** A quick sealant fix costs less than replacing an entire section of piping.
* **Technology used:** Advanced camera inspections or acoustic leak detection tools may slightly increase the price, but they save money in the long run by ensuring precision.

**Transparent Pricing from Johnny Rooter Plumbing**

At Johnny Rooter Plumbing, **clarity is everything**. From your first call, we’ll give you a breakdown of all expected costs—*no hidden fees*. Before we touch a tool, you’ll know exactly what we’re doing, why it’s necessary, and how much it’ll cost.

* **Flat-rate pricing** on common services
* **Upfront quotes** with written estimates
* **Multiple payment options**, including financing for major repairs

We believe that great plumbing shouldn’t break the bank. That’s why we offer flexible pricing to fit nearly every budget.

**How to Save on Long-Term Plumbing Costs**

Plumbing doesn’t have to be a financial drain (pun intended!). Here are some smart ways to keep costs down over time:

* **Schedule annual inspections** to catch problems early
* **Use strainers and catchers** in your sinks and tubs
* **Avoid harsh drain cleaners** that corrode your pipes
* **Install water pressure regulators** to protect your plumbing

**Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

1jrv0a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eutychus/comments/1jrv0a2/what_will_an_infinite_number_of_monkeys_on_an/,What will an Infinite Number of Monkeys on an Infinite Number of Keyboards Produce?,"The driver behind evolutionary change is mutation. Genes foul up in replicating, the theory goes, and the result is a slight tweak on life. Add up enough tweaks, millions upon millions, and look! an amoeba has become an orangutan

Most mutations, though, are bad news. And so, natural selection emerges as the determinant of which ones die out and which ones are preserved, to be passed on to the next generation. Only a beneficial mutation is preserved, since only that variety gives one an advantage in the ""fight for survival.""

Gene replication is amazingly accurate. ""Typically, mistakes are made at a rate of only 1 in every ten billion bases incorporated,"" states the textbook Microbiology. (Tortora, Funke, Case, 2004, pg 217) That's not many, and, remember, only the tiniest fraction of those mutations are said to be any good.

Since gene mutations rarely happen, and almost all that do are neutral or negative, and thus not enshrined by natural selection, a student might reasonably wonder if he is not being sold a bill of goods by evolutionists. Natural selection may work, but so does the law of entropy? Doesn’t natural selection just select the least damaging option? Can “benevolent” mutations possibly account for all they are said to account for?

Enter Thomas Huxley, a 19th-century scientist who supported Charles Darwin's theories of evolution. Huxley came up with the pithy slogan: ""If you give an infinite number of monkeys and infinite number of typewriters, \[What are THOSE?...update to keyboards\] one of them will eventually come up with the complete works of Shakespeare."" Surely the great unwashed can understand that!

Nevertheless, his assertion had never been tested. Until 22 years ago, that is. Evolutionists at England's Plymouth University rounded up six monkeys, supplied them with a computer, placed them on display at Paighton Zoo, and then hid behind trees and trash cans, with notebooks, breathlessly awaiting what would happen! They were disappointed. Four weeks produced page after page of mostly s's. Not a single word emerged. Not even a two-letter word. Not even a one letter word. Researcher Mike Phillips gave details.

At first, he said, “the lead male got a stone and started bashing the hell out of it.” Then, “Another thing they were interested in was in defecating and urinating all over the keyboard,” added Phillips, who runs the university's Institute of Digital Arts and Technologies.

They didn't write any Shakespeare! They shit all over the computer!

Alright, alright, so it wasn't a real science experiment. It was more pop art. And they didn't have an infinite number of monkey or computers. Even science must yield to budgetary constraints. Surely, if you had a infinite number, groused the guardians of evolution, then you would end up with Shakespeare.

Hm. Well, maybe. But wouldn't you also need an infinite number of shovels to dig through an infinite pile of you know what?

University and zoo personnel defended their monkeys. Clearly, they didn't want them held responsible for sabotaging science. Geoff Cox, from the university, pointed out that ""the monkeys aren't reducible to a random process. They get bored and they shit on the keyboard rather than type."" And Vicky Melfi, a biologist at Paignton zoo, added ""they are very intentional, deliberate and very dexterous, so they do want to interact with stuff you give them,"" she said. ""They would sit on the computer and some of the younger ones would press the keys."" Ultimately the monkeys may have fallen victim to the distractions which plague many budding novelists.

Even before buying the car, our salesman treated us like VIPs. So, my dad and I had originally gone to look at an SQ5, but my father fell in love with the comfort and luxury of the Q7, and he wanted to buy it right that day. But since he had not asked my mom, we had to come look at it the other day. Our salesman, especially for us, kept the car for around four days on the lot(mind you, the car was a hot deal, and there were many people wanting to buy that car), but still, after my mom saw it and test drove the car, we decided to buy the car.  

Some issues have come up with the car, but every time the car goes for service, they provide us with a great loaner car(usually a q5) and give us frequent updates on the status of the car. On the topic of Service, their service is great, with free snacks/coffee/drinks in their lobby, but they also fix the car on time with full transparency on what is wrong with the car if something is wrong. Honestly, if we did not have such a great experience, I would not have written this post. If your topmost priority is to have great service, I wouldn't look elsewhere other than Sewell.

[Original Post](https://undelete.pullpush.io/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1ih98md/my_husband_left_our_5_year_old_and_9_month_old/): **February 4, 2025**

My husband is 43 and I'm 31. We've been married for 7 years and have a 5 year old and a 9 month old.

My husband left our children alone and he refuses to admit to it or tell me where he was. I'm furious, enraged, and my husband keeps telling me I'm making a big deal about nothing.

This just happened this weekend. I am on the board of directors for a local non-profit organization. I had to attend an event for that organization this past Saturday, and I was gone for most of the day. My husband was supposed to be home with our kids. I texted him a few times and he responded. When I called around mid-day he didn't respond, but that's not very unusual.

Shortly after that, I got a call from my mom. She said my son had just called her and when she asked him what he and his sister we doing, he said they were both watching TV. When she asked where their dad was, he said his dad wasn't there. My mom asked him several other questions and from my son's responses she believed he was telling the truth and that my husband wasn't there and that there was no adult there at all. She said he didn't seem scared to be alone or worries about where his dad was at. He just called her to chat. He has a tablet designed for children, with pre-programmed contacts that he can call. It's only a few people - just family members.

I left the event immediately and began texting and calling my husband repeatedly. He didn't respond to my first several attempts. It took him about 10 minutes (I was half way home at that point) to respond. I was so confused, so worried, really mad, and I asked him where he was. He said he was at home. I told him our son had just told his grandmother than he was home alone with his baby sister watching TV about 15 minutes ago. My husband denied it and I told him I was too upset to talk and drive.

When I got home, I checked on the kids right away and they were both fine. I asked my husband again - where was he? He said he was home the entire time, he doesn't know what our son was talking about but he must have just been confused since he had gone to the basement to do some laundry. I ran down to the basement - it was the same load of laundry I'd thrown in the dryer the night before! He didn't do any laundry when I was gone! I asked my husband why my son would be confused about whether his dad was home or not. Where in our home would he have gone and for how long for our son to think his dad wasn't home? That doesn't make sense with a 5 year old and a 9 month old. You wouldn't leave them unattended that long. Why was he nowhere to be found when my mom asked my son to go check certain areas of the house?

I begged my husband to just admit it, to stop treating me like an idiot and to stop accusing our son of lying. Just tell me the truth, because being lied to right to my face is so incredibly maddening. He insists he was home, but he can't come up with any believable story of where he was at or what he was doing during that time. The way he answers me when I ask him about this and demand truthful answers is so dismissive. When I tell him ""You left our children alone!"" He quickly says ""No, I didn't, so anyway..."" He says I'm overreacting and letting our son's imagination drive me crazy.

I am convinced he was gone. We don't have a ring camera, but at least one of our neighbors does. I'm so upset about this that I'm tempted to ask our neighbor for the ring footage!

I had to go out to my car and scream and cry because I got so upset. Of course, I didn't want my kids to see my reaction. I can't put into words how upset I am about the fact that I know he must have really left them alone but have no proof and am being treated like I'm just a paranoid nutcase of a mother/woman by him!

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** It's either drugs or an affair. Also, the fact that your 5 year old was calm and nonchalant about the situation makes me believe that he does this frequently enough that the kids are used to it.

> **OOP:** My mom said she and my son chatted for at least 5 minutes before she asked him where his dad was, and when she asked that she still didn't think anything was wrong. She was just trying to make conversation.He gave no indication that anything was wrong and when she started asking him more questions regarding his dad's whereabouts he didn't seemed phased.

**Commenter 2:** I agree that it’s either drugs or an affair if he’s truly leaving them alone. To ease your mind get the footage from your neighbor but do not tell him. Furthermore, given your son’s nonchalance about being left alone, this may not be the first time your husband has done this. Ask your son. Aside from the fact that this is highly dangerous, there are legal ramifications that the both of you can face should the authorities be alerted that the children are being left home alone. You should also get nanny cams (these are discreet cameras unlike a Ring camera). Place them in strategic locations throughout your home.

> **OOP:** He definitely won't be left alone with them anymore, unless it's a test where I am secretly watching the entire time.

**Does OOP's husband have any accounts that she wasn't aware of? Such as bank, etc.**

> **OOP:** He has a separate bank account that I don't have access to. It's not a secret account. I know it exists. I don't have debit card for it, I'm not named on the account, and I don't have his login details. I have no clue what's in it. We have a joint account too.
> 
> He has his own credit cards. I don't know what's on those either.

**Commenter 3:** I feel like the timeline is weird. How did your husband get home in the ten minutes since he answered your phone call and you got there. 

Doesn't mean I think he's telling you the truth, and I think you should get the ring footage to put either claim to rest. 

Is your husband friends with any neighbors?

> **OOP:** If he was within 10 minutes from our house. Well, he speeds on a good day, so if he was in his car and within 20 minutes of our house he technically could have got home in time. I've wondered if he actually got my initial panicked calls and texts, didn't answer, started racing home, and then finally picked up once he was home so he could pretend he was there all along.

**Additional Information from OOP on her conversation with her five-year-old son regarding her husband/his father**

> **OOP:** I talked to him after I ""calmed down"" a little bit. His story was virtually the same as what he'd told my mom, with a few more details, but nothing that gave me any clue about what my husband was up to.
> 
> I asked him what he did when I was gone. He said daddy made him pancakes and they drank coffee outside. (My 5 year old doesn't actually drink coffee, but he pretends to drink it in the morning and he likes to sit outside with his hot ""coffee."") His sister had a giant poop explosion and of course he remembered that, and apparently dad was there to clean that up because he said she pooped EVERYWHERE and he had to help dad give her a bath and it was disgusting. (Curious that my husband supposedly did laundry but left the poop covered onesie unwashed!) That was the highlight of his day and he loved telling me about how gross it was.
> 
> I asked him if daddy left. He said yeah, daddy left, like it was no big deal. I asked him what he did when daddy was gone. He said he watched TV. I asked him what he watched. I asked him what his sister (9 month old baby) was doing when daddy was gone and he said she was in the living room watching TV with him too. I ask him if he was sure daddy was gone. He said yeah, daddy wasn't home. I asked him how he knew and he said daddy's keys were gone and daddy told him to stay in the living room with his sister. He has no real concept of time, so asking him how long daddy was gone for wouldn't really mean anything. I didn't want him to feel like he was in trouble or like I was grilling him, and it sort of seemed like that's how he started to feel when I kept asking questions.

[Update #1](https://undelete.pullpush.io/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1iksr5c/update_my_husband_left_our_5_year_old_and_9_month/): **February 8, 2025 (four days later)** 

Last weekend my husband left our 5 year old and 9 month old home alone while I was gone and then refused to admit it or provide a plausible explanation.

Since then, we had many arguments about it. I've been living in a constant state of anger and frustration. I didn’t want to fight about it anymore, but I could't help it and I kept bringing it up again and again. I couldn't ""lay low"" and pretend to get over it while I waited for him to do it again and catch him in whatever was going on. I also knew that demanding he tell me the truth wasn’t going to get me anywhere. Since he’d been refusing to talk and deflecting for days. All it was doing was making me enraged and feel like I was about to have a brain aneurysm.

I told him to hand me his phone so I could check his location at the time. He refused. He said he wouldn’t do it and that it was a violation of his privacy, he “won’t be treated that way” and refuses to give into my delusions. You think I enjoy being in a situation where I have to beg my husband to show me his phone so I can see where he was at? I hate it. I don’t want to live that way. I told him it’s simple - if he was really at home the entire time, just prove it. Why wouldn’t he want to clear this whole thing up? 

I got so mad that he wouldn’t turn over his phone that I told him I was going to the neighbor’s to get their doorbell footage. At first he was like “fine, go do it.” He didn’t think I actually would. He knows I don’t like to air drama to others so he probably figured I’d just swallow all of this crap he’s been giving me. Luckily, I was totally being driven by anger at this point, so nothing was going to stop me from going to the neighbor’s. When I actually started to go out the door he tried to stop me and followed me out the door. I felt pure anger rushing through my veins, nothing else. The neighbor, who I’ve probably said less than 10 words to in the entire time we’ve lived here, told me he’d send me the footage. I went home, told my husband that the neighbor didn’t have the footage from that day anymore, and told him I just needed to go to the store and cool off. So I put the kids in the car and went and parked somewhere while I waited for the neighbor to send me the footage. I have the neighbor’s number now too, and he told me if I need any more footage he will be happy to give it to me.

The video shows a blue car that I don’t recognize show up and park in our driveway. A blonde woman gets out of the car and goes towards my house. She walks on the outside of our garage toward the gate leading to our backyard. The gate is too far back and out of the way to be seen on the doorbell footage. She and her car was there for 23 minutes. Imagine that - the car leaves right around the time that my husband called me to say he was home and had been home the entire time, as I was rushing home in a panic and calling him on repeat. 

One of 2 possibilities as to where they went. She either came in through the side door of the house, which does provide direct access to the basement. Or, and what I think is more likely, is that they were in the back most area of our yard, which is a gated pool area. Immediately behind our house is a grass lawn, then you step down a few steps and we have a patio, and then there is a fully gated area where the pool is. It’s not like you think of when you picture a gated pool. It’s a full, 6ft wood fence all the way around, plus even taller landscaping for added privacy. You can’t see into the area at all unless you’re inside. I think it’s more likely that they were back there because my son said his dad’s keys were gone and we keep that gate locked with a key. 

The pool is closed for winter, but there is 1 small building back there (sort of like a shed we converted into a changing area) and there is a covered patio with furniture. I’m convinced that’s where they were. So technically he was “home,” but in an area totally removed from the house and where he couldn’t see or hear the kids if something happened. 

I asked him how he could explain this. What were they doing? (I obviously don’t need him to tell me what they were doing, but for some reason I still had hope that he’d finally be honest.) He wasn’t contrite. He showed no remorse. He was just like “Yeah, she was here, but I obviously never left!” 

Who is she? How long has this been going on? And if he’s going to be such a disgusting, despicable excuse of a man then why couldn’t he at least have found any other time and any other lie or excuse other than when he was home alone with our kids? I told him I know this has happened before and I demanded to know how many times he’s done this when he’s been home alone with the kids. He swears this is the only time, but he still doesn’t have the balls to confess to what they were doing. I don’t believe him that this was the only time, fyi. 

I still have so many questions and I still feel like my heart is beating 200 times a minute. My blood pressure is through the roof. I’ve cried a lot, sobbed, begged for somebody to help me, yelled, screamed, ordered a bunch of books about divorce and custody. And you know what? The next day after our multiple explosive fights, him putting his hands on me, and me seeing the evidence, he acted like everything was totally normal and like none of that stuff ever happened. I woke up still seething, exhausted, broken, and he’s acting like everything is totally normal. He said he was ordering breakfast to be delivered from our favorite breakfast place. He asked if I wanted to go to the store together later and try this new recipe for chili tonight. What? Why would k want to do any of these things with you now? Absolutely no acknowledgement of anything he’s done or what’s transpired between us in the past few days. He deserved an Oscar for how well he was able to act like none of that happened, completely comfortable and non-phased. 

I know that it’s a waste of my energy, but I just desperately want him to admit the full truth of what he did that day and any other day with this woman. I want to hear it from him. It won’t change whatever he’s done, but he could at least have the respect and decency to be honest now that he’s been caught. That’s a ridiculous thought though, right? How foolish of me to expect this man to show decency and honesty now? If he was a decent and honest man than he wouldn’t have had a strange woman over to our house and been out of sight from our kids for 23 minutes! His continued denial and refusal to admit to anything other than the bare minimum, his attitude like I’m somehow being controlling or infringing on his rights by asking for information…that’s almost more hurtful than him cheating on me.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** So he f a blond in the back while  leaving the kids unsupervised. Sorry, but that is the only explanation. He wasn’t planning a surprise for you. He wouldn’t shit on the kids’s safety for that. He left the kids alone for something selfish. And he was brazen and comfortable enough to bring his side piece to your house. At this point every word out of his mouth has been a lie. You should ask the neighbor if he’s seen that care before. 

> **OOP:** I know they were fucking. I'm not trying to delude myself into thinking she came over to talk or for a cup of tea. I just want him to admit it. It's driving me crazy that he won't admit to it even though he's been caught.

**Commenter 2:** OP, he has not been honest and won’t be honest. Even if he is, what would that give you? Could you even believe it?

OP, you know what he was doing. You don’t need him to spell it out for you. Put yourself and your children first.

> **OOP:** At the end of the day, him admitting to what he's done wouldn't really change anything. It certainly won't change anything he's done. It won't make it better. And I probably still wouldn't believe I was getting the full truth. Yet, I can't stop seething over the fact that he's refusing to give me any info.

**Commenter 3:** Weird thing is, if he showed his location, it would have been at home and probably put you more at ease that he didn't leave, he is garbage especially to be doing that shit when he has the kids, leaving them on their own, he'd rather cheat and possibly his kids getting hurt or dying. Disgusting.

> **OOP:** Yes!! It doesn't make sense. Why wouldn't he have just given me his phone? It makes me think that there are other things on his phone besides his location that he doesn't want me to see.

**Commenter 4:** I'm really concerned for your mental health (I read the original post too).  Maybe I watch too many psychological thrillers, but this comes across like he's a psycho intent on making you looking unhinged so he can admit you to a psych ward, or at least, divorce you, get out of alimony and child support and keep the house and kids. 

Id pack the kids up if I were you, go to your parents for a bit, and cool off.   Call a lawyer stat. Start the divorce and keep that recording

> **OOP:** I'm concerned for my mental health right now too.

#----NEW UPDATE----

**Trigger Warnings:** >!alcoholism, drug use, denial!<

[Update #2](https://web.archive.org/web/20250330002205/https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1jmykfh/update_2_my_husband_left_our_5_year_old_and_9/): **March 29, 2025 (more than 1.5 months later)**

It’s been around a month since I last posted. I’ve received so many messages and comments asking for an update and if me and my kids are okay. I’m sorry for not responding. 

I’m sort of scared to post this because I don’t think people will agree with my decision. Initially, I really wanted to be able to share an update saying I had filed for divorce. When I saw thaat footage of a strange woman sneaking into our backyard, and even moreso when he refused to give me any info or admit to anything (even going as far to say he’d never give me the satisfaction of admitting to anything), I was 100% divorce. I immediately started to research and make a plan. I wasn’t in a position to divorce right away. I thought that it might be better to try to keep my head down, pretend like everything was ok, and quietly/secretly prepare everything. 

Divorce is still on my mind and a possibility, but I’m no longer 100% committed to it. My husband and I are still together currently and living under the same roof. Although he held out on admitting to any wrong doing both with leaving our kids unattended in the house and about having sex with another woman in the pool shed - he held out for a long time and we argued a lot. I kept telling myself it was pointless and I was only driving myself crazy - he wasn’t going to suddenly be honest, and he admitted more than once that he wouldn’t tell me the truth and felt no reason to tell me the truth. During that time, I also found him secretly going out to the garage to drink alcohol, which he’d deny. I drive myself crazy finding his stash of alcohol and other things out in the garage. He still denied it even though I was literally holding the evidence. 

Then, about 2 weeks ago he admitted he had a problem, or multiple problems, and that what he did that day was wrong. He finally admitted to leaving the kids alone in the house. He admitted to having sex with the woman in our pool shed. She’s not a woman he’s having an affair with. She’s a sex worker. She’s transexual. He said it in a way like I should have been relieved by all of this. The thing is, I knew he watched porn (never seemed to get in the way of our relationship or our lives). I even knew that he liked to watch trans porn. He was open about these things with me. But should I have suspected that this meant he was hiring trans sex workers to have the real life experience? Honestly, I’m really asking that. Was I naive to think he was seeking that out just because he liked to watch that type of porn? He didn’t keep the porn a secret from me and I honestly never thought he was going to seek it out in real life or cheat on me with a trans person. He also assured me that he now only regularly sees two trans women who are “clean” and “safe” and “very professional.” And when I asked him how much he pays these women for their services…yeah they better be a lot of things for that price. I can’t believe it! 

He also admitted to drinking too much and to drinking a lot before he engages with these women. At times he’s taken drugs during these encounters too, but insists he doesn’t have a “problem,” meaning addiction. I personally think he’s addicted to alcohol and possibly other substances but he binges them when I’m not around and manages to remain normal and sober when I’m around.

He started drinking more heavily and regularly since that day, hence the hiding booze in the garage and chugging it when he thought I was in the shower. He says he’s doing it because he’s so stressed about me leaving him and because he knows he’s a POS for everything he’s done to me and our kids. 

He’s not allowed to be left alone with our kids anymore. He’s also not allowed to have sex with me for the foreseeable future. Neither are meant as punishment. These rules are in place to keep me and our kids safe, plus I have no emotional or physical desire to have sex with him now. So, I don’t know that our relationship will survive. 

He fears his job will be compromised if he seeks help for any of this. I’m at the point where it’s like screw your job - we’ll find some way to survive - this is way bigger than a job.

He has stopped drinking, at least as far as I can tell. He took 2 weeks off work to try to figure himself out. He’s been helping around the house and doing all of the things a good husband should do. I have hidden cameras installed all over my home and property. I don’t want to live this way but I’m not ready to file for divorce yet. I hope to get to a place financially and logistically where I can at least be prepared so that I could file for divorce at the drop of a hat if I absolutely needed to. I’ve told him this. He’s aware that I’ve been preparing for divorce. He did ask me about sex today, how long it’d be before I’d finally have sex with him again. It’s been mere weeks and he’s already asking that, which is unbelievable in a way, yet this man masturbates several times a day without fail. I don’t believe in sex addiction, or I didn’t before, but I’m starting to wonder if it could be a real thing and if my husband has it. He isn’t saying he does, but I’m starting to think my husband may actually have a number of hidden addictions that he can’t even admit to himself. In a weird way, it’s comforting because I see it as a defined problem that might be fixable, but on the other hand I’m totally grossed out by it all and it makes me feel extremely uncomfortable to think about dealing with this possibly forever? 

For now, me and my kids are safe. Things have calmed down. I’m not living every moment feeling completely consumed by rage. I still feel that way sometimes but I feel a lot more steady than I did. I feel more clear headed and surprisingly almost lacking emotion about the whole thing. It’s like all of my emotions came in one big wave, then just washed out to sea. I honestly feel more clear headed right now than I have in a long time.

**Relevant Comments** 

**Commenter 1:** You truly don’t sound clear headed to me? Why are you with someone who cheats on you? And left your young children by themselves? And has multiple serious addictions?He can’t be trusted.

He needs actual professional help. rehab or something! Do you have any family or friends you could possibly stay with?

I am super concerned for your children.

> **OOP:** I don't know that he actually has any addictions; I've just to wonder if he does. Either way, I am trying to convince him to seek some sort of professional help to deal with his issues.
> 
> My kids are fine. They are never left alone with him. They're with me at all times, or if absolutely needed they're with friends or family.

**Commenter 2:** “Now only regularly sees”….

OP, so he’s cheating on you and you’re okay with it? Get yourself tested for STDs, separate your finances, and keep building up that plan to leave for the day you (hopefully) come to your senses and stop teaching your kids they don’t need to be faithful in a relationship or that it’s completely normal and acceptable to be cheated on and lied to.

> **OOP:** The way I worded it makes it sound like it's ongoing presently right now. When he confessed this all to me a few weeks ago he said he had only been seeing the same two sex workers that he knew and ""trusted."" He had been with other ones before them, but decided it was safer to stick to his two favorites. That's even the word he used...his ""favorites."" He looked at me with a straight face and said that. But he's not supposed to be doing anything with any sex workers anymore.

**Commenter 3:** How on earth are you ""safe"" if you're still living with him?  Honey, I grew up with an alcoholic father. No way in hell is your husband going to stay sober.  You and your kids aren't safe. 

> **OOP:** I don't know that he's an alcoholic.I mean, he's sober most of the time and drinking doesn't get in the way of his work or anything like that.

People come and go, stay for a bit, then like all of a sudden you hear ""arriving at Bethesgone Station"" na. Kinda been thinking about it a lot lately.

Kasi diba, we were like two trains na sabay nag-stop sa same station? For a while, akala ko same tayo ng route, as in same wavelength, same trip, same vibes. We'd chill, laugh at the same corny jokes, and just... connected, right? 

Pero ayun. Ako kasi, I admit naman na napa-overthink ako na baka we're meant to ride together forever. So I tried to, like, move to your track. But it's like...bad decision pala. Turns out, iba pala talaga yung directions natin.

After that, nagulo na lahat. Mixed signals, tapos bigla ka na lang nawala. Not like blocked levels, pero wala ka na sa life ko. Or like ako ba yung lumayo? I can't even remember. And tbh, looking back, yun yung mas masakit eh. Not yung failed romance part, but like yung lost friendship. Like ang sakit lang talaga.

Pero here's the thing: I saw you sa IG the other day. Yung sa page nung cafe where you work. And dude, you looked... happy. Like, legit thriving levels of happy. And you know what's wild? Instead of feeling sour or salty, I felt... okay. Parang nakita ko yung train mo from my window, going strong sa sarili mong path. And I realized na we're both kinda where we need to be.

NGL, it took me forever to get my own train back on track. Pero now? All good na. And seeing you happy? Parang universe telling me na tama yung nangyari. Good energy lang.

Anyway, ayoko maging emotional. Just wanna say... I'm happy for you. And I'm happy for me too. Life's funny like that talaga. Like it takes pero it gives din naman. 

Maybe someday magkita ulit tayo and we'll laugh about this. Or maybe not. Either way, keri lang.

P.S. Maybe I'm gonna visit that cafe soon. Kasi you look masarap talaga. Char. I mean the coffee.

The following events all took place over a matter of about five minutes or so.


This morning my cat woke me up suddenly around 6:00am when he knocked something off my nightstand. I sat up quickly to check on him and immediately began to feel a pain in my chest, similar to when I used to smoke too many cigarettes and would feel pain and tightness in my lungs. Then I realized the pain was more below my sternum, like heartburn or acid reflux, although ""heart attack"" did cross my mind due to the severity and the sudden onset. As the pain increased rapidly, my vision started closing in and I passed out, falling off the bed and onto the floor. At this point my husband was awake calling for me to wake up. I got back on the bed and laid on my back with my feet elevated, panting and dizzy. When the dizziness subsided, so did the pain, and I got up to go to the bathroom. Looking in the mirror, my face was a ghostly shade of greenish grey. After a few minutes, I felt much better and my color was back. I've been fine ever since. Hubby wants me to go to the doctor and get checked out but I'm hesitant because I really feel fine now.

When we left the coffee shop he started acting strange and not talking to which I told him that why does he think he is entitled to me buying him food, that he isnt even thankful for the coffee. And he blamed me for leaving him just with eggs for lunch.

He then decided to not talk at all the whole journey to go pick up my brother; my brother was in the car and he didnt even say a word. We then went to the gym and he started packing his things and went to sleep.

I feel that he is taking advantage of my generosity.

1jrumsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jrumsl/aith_for_going_to_my_sisters_mother_in_law_and/,AITH for going to my sisters  mother in law and “telling on them”,"As childish as it sounds I tried my best to be an adult in the situation. 
I’m the oldest sister of my family and I’m 27 if that matters. 

For over a year now I’ve been around my sister (24 ~let’s call her Maggie) and brother in law (33?~let’s call him Stan) more frequently. I moved closer over a year ago to be able to be around my sister and I have a cute baby nephew. 

When I moved here I was climbing out of a dark depression. And I know I wasn’t fully there and maybe a lot more self centered in my own little depressed world. I know I wasn’t fully there. 
Maggie and Stan had moved to where we live a year before I moved there. When they moved they brought a friend with them. 
Now I know my brother in law would take pain meds back home before they moved there. I knew these where the bad pain meds. But I thought my sister had things handled idk I wasn’t really present. I feel so stupid now.  

Well, the friend that moved with them passed away a few months after they moved. He passed away in my sister apartment. I can’t remember if she was in there or not when it happened but she found him dead in his room. He overdosed. He apparently had a heroin addiction. 
This woke my sister up up for a second. 

Maggie works really hard. She is so so smart and she honestly is a better human than I am I truly believe this. Everyone around her relays on her! She is literally a superwoman. 

Once Maggie found her friend dead in her apartment she started questioning Stan. Stan in fact also had a addiction problem as well. When she found out she tried to do her best to keep things on the low and do things on the low because she is traumatized from foster care. We grew up in foster care. So she didn’t want them to get involved. But because she can only do so much Stan was drug tested for only heroin randomly by her for only a few months.

During this time I moved to closer to them. I noticed that coke was still around. 
I am actually very uncomfortable with drugs. Because I saw how much my mom struggled growing up. She was a meth addict. And all of us kids faced the consequences of our mother being a drug addict. 

Because I was so uncomfortable being around it I eventually expressed to Maggie how I didn’t find that to be healthy especially because she has a two year old. So she hid it better. 
She also would take Adderall in college. She enjoyed it a lot. There was a moment where I enjoyed it with her while we were in college. (4/5 years ago) But we never had a prescription. And I had an experience where It made me realize how I definitely shouldn’t be taking that and I saw how my life could be if I continued so I completely stopped after a year. 

My history with drugs are more of the hippy side besides the Adderall. I would smoke weed and experiment with mushrooms. And I still smoke weed to this day but I really don’t do anything but a cup of coffee and my nicotine stick. I don’t drink alcohol unless I’m trying to be social at a party. But you know everyone has a past and I have a past with my own things. With time I’ve become more focused in living in the current world. Like I want to be my full self with no drugs. I go to therapy twice a month and I work hard to keep myself in a good state of mind with no medication for my depression or anxiety. I honestly feel a million times better today than I have a year ago even three years ago! And because of that I have become more “against” drugs you could say. Well, my sister definitely thinks I’m like a narc now or something. But like I honestly don’t care about drugs unless it has an impact in my life. And I’ll still smoke a bowl! 

I currently think it has an impact in my life. Not from me. But maybe from Maggie and Stan. Once I expressed concern it immediately got flipped into I was judging and attacking. So things where hidden better. My sister got prescribed adderall for her ADHD. Which she might have but I question if that is the right diagnosis for her mental state. I see indications like a rolled up dollar bill and a plate with a card near by.  Things like that. Stan has a friend around who wasn’t the nicest person to my brother and also had to go to rehab for what Maggie told me was for “weed”. Lol 

So Maggie and my relationship with each other felt like it was getting distanced for awhile because I would see something and then say something. And I mean it out of concern from our past not that I don’t think she is a good person or that she lacks ability. It’s that I saw our past and I feel sometimes it’s coming into her present. I eventually started walking on eggshells to hold onto any hope of a relationship with Maggie or my nephew because at a point I just felt like she thought I was mothering her which I mean maybe I was a little idk. 

Stan and I had a really cool brother and sister relationship when I first met him. I was so happy for them and they were so cute together. Well, the relationship we had got completely destroyed when he got into my sister and and I’s argument about our brother. Stan started getting physical with me and shoved me to the ground and fucked my leg up. Since that point, my view of Stan has gotten smaller and smaller. With every bit of bad he does I don’t like him more. At this point I might as well say my sister deserves so much better. He also sits on his Xbox and calls out of work while my sister works two jobs. And then ask me for money to help pay rent. 

Well my breaking point was when I found out my sister had to put her dog down. I found out she took her dog to the vet wayyyyy too late and called me crying at 1am the day before talking about how she needs thousands of dollar for a surgery she actually didn’t even get him looked at to see if he needed. She called a vet number and they said he probably has “this” and “that” and it’s estimated to be thousands of dollars for “that” and “this”. But when she took him to the vet he was so sick he had to be put down. On the phone call I wasn’t nice. I thought she called for money (which is common and we got a chunk of money that has kept me on my feet for awhile that she blew threw after 6months). I also thought at that point all that was happening was she thought her dog was losing weight because of worms. I had no idea how bad things actual where. I was out of town for the last month on a business trip. I also found out that people where expressing concern about her dog weeks before she took him to the vet.
Over all, I was extremely disappointed because I felt as if there was a bit of neglect with her dog. 

But, I didn’t handle it well, being there for my sister when she called me.

It hit me that maybe the dog was neglected and I don’t think Maggie is that person and like there is too much other stuff happening for me not to believe that the focus for them isn’t normal or right and maybe things are actually toxic? 
After all of that happening and all the other things I learned about after her dog got put down I was so disappointed. And honestly I’m scared. 
I’ve been clocking all these things happening and saying something only to Maggie thinking she has things under control. After all of this I realized it’s bad. Or we’ll I think it is. And maybe Maggie doesn’t have it under control? 

I thought about what I should do. Maybe an intervention? What do they do? 
So I thought I’ll call my sisters mother in law and tell her my concerns. She is an adult who has more authority than I do that cares as much as I do and maybe she can help me navigate all of what I’ve been seeing and see what steps we need to take. We can deal with it together. 

So I called. It was hard at first because immediately she went on defense and was like “they would never”. But after I explained “look I don’t think they are bad people I’m concerned. Other people are calling me and they are concerned“ and I told her everything I’ve seen. Everything I’ve herd. Everything. I also ask her to pleaseeeee keep it between me and her because otherwise I think stan and maggie will think I’m just shit talking when that isn’t what I’m trying to do. So she agreed! She told me we can figure it out together. 

At the end of the conversation it feels like she gets it. She knows I’m just concerned and that we can work together to figure this out. To figure out if there is even a problem. So we hang up the phone and I felt good like I did the right thing I guess. 


Welllllllll two weeks have pasted. And I got a text from Maggie and Stan basically saying I’m never allowed to see my nephew again. How could I go behind there back and go to his mom and that they are never speaking to me again. I haven’t herd from the mother in law since we spoke on the phone. But from what it sounds like apparently it seems like she told them everything. 

I’m a bit heart broken and a bit taken a back. 
I feel like an asshole. I feel like I’ve lost a part of my life. And I know there is no recovering from that. I tried to reach out to the mother in law and ask her what happened and she has totally ignored me.

And I swear this isn’t a flex, just a legit “what is going on” situation.

I’m a pretty routine guy. I work remotely, I like good coffee, and I try to mix up my café spots around Chennai so I don’t turn into that guy who’s always hogging a seat at one place. But over the past few months, I’ve had the strangest feeling I’m accidentally part of someone else’s story.

Let’s start with July 2024. I was at Phoenix Mall, Starbucks—pretty standard day. All the seats were full except for one across from a girl at a table. I asked if it was taken, she said no, and that was that. I sat, worked, minded my business. But I remember thinking—she seemed cool. The kind of presence you notice even if you’re not trying to. But I didn’t say anything. I’m not that smooth.

Then maybe 3–4 weeks later, I’m at a café on the other side of town. Different crowd, chill vibe. I sit down, open my laptop, get into the zone—and there she is. Same girl. Didn’t say anything again, but this time I was definitely more aware of it. Coincidence? Sure. Chennai’s big, but not that big, right?

Now here’s where it gets full-on cinematic.

Cut to this Thursday—I grab lunch at Dou in Alwarpet. (Side note: if you haven’t tried their mushroom lasagna, you haven’t lived). I sit down, ready to power through a few emails. Look up—and there she is. Again. Third time. Different place. Different month. Same girl.

At this point, I’m internally glitching. Am I being followed? Are we in a low-budget Netflix original? Am I supposed to say something clever now? I didn’t. I froze. Again. Classic me. Just awkwardly existing in linen like I belong on someone’s Pinterest board or something (don’t ask me why I was dressed like that—it was laundry day, okay?).

Now I can’t stop thinking about it. Was this just a series of weird coincidences? Or is the universe trying to slap me awake like, “Bro, say hi already!”?

Anyway, if you’re out there, girl-from-three-cafés, just know I noticed too. And I regret not saying hi as well.

Next time, maybe let’s just grab coffee?

I feel like I must give you some backstory.  

For starters, I'm 44 years old and I've had a very tumultuous life.  I've been through a lot.  I grew up for the first 7 years with an abuse father who hit me so hard in the head as a young child that it left me with lifelong hearing loss.  My mother divorced this man and remarried in 1987 to a man that was much kinder, but still very abusive to me when she worked nights.  This continued for many years until I was almost a teenager.

As a teenager, I became much stronger.  Started working out every day, was in martial arts for a while until I joined football, where I could take my teenage frustration out on hitting people as hard as I could.  I found out that I was very good at this and athletics in general.  I graduated high school as what I would call an extreme underachiever.  I had a thirst for knowledge, an extreme thirst for literary knowledge, having read an astounding amount of literature in my free time.  I'd often get lost in books.  Sometimes Vonnegut or Dickens, J.D. Salinger.  I learned to read, through living in this broken home with an alcoholic father, at 4 years old at a really high level right off the bat.  Sometimes I would get frustrated at school because my reading and writing comprehension was more advanced than the kids around me so I found school to be boring.

In high school, I was often socially awkward around girls.  I just always seemed to do things that were far too overboard.  Around other guys, however, I was always the life of the party.  Everyone in my high school knew me and I was generally friends with everyone.  By junior year, I had sort of figured out how to talk to women.  I met a wonderful woman named Patricia who would unknowingly become the love of my life.  We would date, break up for a while, then date again.  It seemed that neither of us could really be apart from each other for any real period of time.

But in 1999, I had a job at a company building wooden privacy fences.  I had graduated high school and I did enjoy this type of hard physical labor.  For reference, I was 6' tall, 185lbs and very lean.  I could lift anything, exert myself in ways that others could not and this felt good to me but I developed a bit of a drinking problem because after this type of work, the older guys would gather in the parking lot at work and drink until sundown.  Although I found this somewhat amusing and I would partake, at the same time, I didn't want my life to be that.  While on hiatus from dating Patricia, I walked into an army recruiting station and, out of nowhere, I signed up to join the US Army.  I had to get a waiver for my hearing problem, though it's not noticeable to others.  I remain about 40% deaf.  

Although Patricia and I were not dating, I told her of my plan to join the army and she got extremely emotional.

I shipped out January 20th, 2000 to Fort Sill Oklahoma.  We talked every chance we got and it was pretty much understood that we had feelings for each other that we didn't know we had.  I wrote her letters every day and talked to her on the phone when I could.  I came home on leave and we both lost each others' virginity to each other.  

I was assigned to the 1st Infantry Division, Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, Bamberg, Germany.  The only way Patricia and I could be together would be if we got married, which was already a foregone conclusion by then.  

Everything was going fine until one day in September, two planes crashed into the World Trade Center.  The world knew, and we knew, pretty quickly that we would be fighting in a war.  We were married on October 7th, 2001.

Although I would get deployed, we traveled all over Europe together.  Switzerland, France, Germany, Czech Republic, Poland, Austria, Italy - you name it, we went there.  It was quite a romance and one that I obviously have not and will not forget.  Just two crazy kids, traveling and making love all over the world.  

But I had anger issues.  Although I never laid a hand on her, I would sometimes get angry, which was probably just a coping mechanism that I learned growing up around abuse.  I loved her too much to ever physically harm her, but I'm quite sure I put her through unnecessary mental anguish.  I was put on stop loss in 2003 and was supposed to ETS a few months later, but couldn't go home.  After being deployed, I just wanted to go home and start my life, figure out what was wrong with me and try to work on being a better husband and maybe a father at some point.

But I came home after the stop loss was lifted and I didn't become a better person, I became a worse person.  Always angry, not wanting to be a good husband to her.  We divorced in 2004.  But that would not be the last of our time together.

We got back together, like we always did, and I had a renewed sense of urgency.  I was a better man but still quite imperfect.  But one thing I never doubted was that I loved this woman so intensely that it gave Romeo and Juliet a run for their money.  But I was still not quite right.  We dated unmarried for 4 more years.  Then she left me for a man she was talking to online that had convinced her that he was the drummer for the band Modest Mouse, which I believe she was being catfished.  By then I had enough, or so I thought, and broke up with her without even a goodbye.  Of course I still had feelings for her and believed in time, that she would be back.

But I didn't put my life on hold, so I dated.  A lot.  I was living with one girl in Ann Arbor and having sex with her while dating another.  During this time period, I received a facebook message from one of her friends telling me I should contact Patricia.  Foolishly, I did not.  But a few months later, I received the ultimate heartbreak.  She was pregnant by a man old enough to be her father.  This broke my heart in so many ways that I can't even describe it.  So I gave up on it.  I went out and got high, got drunk and slept with as many women as I could, basically, for years.  I guess I was just trying to kill my emotions.  I was trying to forget her.

Oh... this is about dreams, right?  Well, the thing is that I never really remembered any dreams.  Fast forward about 5 years and my stepdad had bone cancer.  My mother and I took care of him at home, where he died.  In the meantime, I had heard through a grapevine that Patricia was unhappy.  This was in 2011 and by then I had amassed enough cash to buy a house outright.  We both grew up in the same town and I bought a house a few blocks, unintentionally honestly, from where she had grown up, within sight of the school that we had both went to.  Subconsciously, maybe I did this on purpose, thinking that she would want to live there close to her parents and convenient for her kid to walk to school.

Then, and only then, after I had my shit together, did I try to contact her.  She left a special plate that we bought together in Poland in the old apartment.  I found it while moving in to my new house and decided that if she was unhappy, the return of this future heirloom might be a good way to talk to her, find out her situation and perhaps have one last meaningful interaction with her and maybe - just maybe, get her to come back to me.  She was always on my mind, even though I had slept with nearly every woman in the county.

I ran into her mother randomly just before this and we had a lengthy chat in a grocery store.  My mother ran into Patricia as well and told me that she looked unhappy and alluded that Patricia would want to talk to me again, at least that was the impression that was given through them talking.

So I boxed up the plate and left it on her mother's doorstep with a letter that I would like to perhaps have a coffee and reminisce about our time in Europe.  I received an email back that basically said she never thought about me and it was only about 5 sentences long.  Again, I was crushed.  She didn't even owe me the email, so I guess I shouldn't have had any hard feelings.  But then again, I had this really amazing hosue, I was single and so I began to sleep around again.  Many women came and went, none stuck.

So eventually, being single, I sold the house and moved into a smaller place.

So let's get more to the point on the dreams.  The only other woman I've ever loved was my mother.  Two years ago, she had a stroke and began having seizures before suddenly going blind.  I quit my job and took care of her full time for the last 2 and a half years.  She died last Thursday, her only son being single with no children.  This broke my heart more than anything has ever broken me before.  She was my support and I loved my mother more than anything.  But I didn't have much time to grieve and I quickly got hired by a company and I now make more money than I ever have.  Job is great, the people are great.

But for the last week, I get sudden bouts of fatigue after not working for the last two years and I basically get tired suddenly right when I get home and eat.  This happens at about 6pm.  When I fall asleep, for the past 2 weeks, every afternoon I dream of Patricia and the dreams are so vivid and real.  She's always in a bad place, always doing things that upset me.  Tonight in my dream she was a drug addict, living house to house, couch surfing and I find her and try to get her to get clean and sober but she just tells me no in the dream.  In other dreams I've had for the past few weeks, she's struggling or unhappy.  And I'm telling you that the dreams are so real that I wake up shaking and angry that her life has turned out that way.

I've not spoken to her in years but obviously never fully forgotten about her, but it jars me right to my core because I never have dreams.  This is such a strange experience for me and it makes me so sad, especially given what I've just been through.  Could this just be subconscious trauma?  Or something else?  I'm sorry that I've written a novel, but I thought the backstory was necessary.  Is this just some Freudian way of my mind coping with loss after loss or do you think there could be more to it?  What is your take on having dreams like this?  I've never been interested in interpreting dreams mostly because I believed it's mumbo-jumbo horoscope stuff, but I find myself searching for answers.

I just read this fascinating article about how cities like Bengaluru, Mumbai and Chennai are embracing sober socializing—think silent discos, morning dance raves, board game meetups and alcohol-free cocktail bars. With health-conscious millennials/Gen Z driving the trend, it got me wondering: Could Belagavi join the movement? 

What’s Happening in Other Cities: 

\- Silent Music Parties: Headphone-clad crowds dance to DJs with zero-proof cocktails (e.g., Green Theory, Bengaluru). 

\- Coffee Raves: Daytime DJ parties in cafés (Chennai’s Cybervoid Collective). 

\- Sober Sundowners: Alcohol-free networking events (Mumbai’s Sobriety Sips). 

\- Board Game Clubs: HSR Meetups in Bengaluru attracts 100s for substance-free fun. 

Belagavi’s Potential? 

\- Café Culture: With spots like Café Coffee Day, Third Wave, could we host coffee raves? 

\- College Crowd: Students might love silent parties or game nights (imagine this at VTU or Rani Chennamma Park). 

\- Health Wave: Gyms/yoga studios (like Cult.fit) could partner for sober socials. 

 

1. Would you attend a sober event in Belagavi? (e.g., morning dance party, mocktail tasting).  

2. What venues/spaces could work here? 

3. Are there already hidden sober communities in the city?

1jrudk1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jrudk1,"Review KA Priority, dari POV pengguna KA Eksekutif biasa.","Ngelunasin komentar gue di DCT beberapa hari yang lalu.

Context : Setelah mudik ke Jakarta naik Sleepernya GHTS, TS akan kembali gawe ke daerah Jember naik KA Pandalungan. Since now I have the freedom to buy whatever tickets I please, I thought why not jajal KA Prioritynya Pandalungan yang udah jalan reguler di rute ini sejak awal Maret kemarin.

Introduction :

Moda Transportasi : Kereta Api Jarak Jauh

Nama Kereta : Pandalungan

Relasi : Jakarta (Gambir) - Jember*

Kelas : Eksekutif (Stainless Steel 2018), Priority

Waktu tempuh : 13 jam 5 menit** (Start Gambir 19.55, nyampe Jember pukul 09.00

*TS turun di Stasiun Tanggul, Kabupaten Jember

*TS tiba di Stasiun Tanggul pada pukul 08.42 WIB

Harga (per akhir Maret 2025) : Eksekutif 870k, Priority 1.100-1.150k

Gue akan membagi review ini menjadi beberapa poin. 

1. Ticketing

Tiket bisa ente beli di aplikasi Access by KAI.

2. Luxury Lounge

- cara masuk ke loungenya piye?

Setelah boarding, gue langsung naik ke lantai 2 agar gue bisa langsung jajal Luxury Loungenya. Luxury Lounge di Gambir terbagi menjadi 2 Lounge, Lounge 1 tersedia di sebelah barat dan it serves keberangkatan kereta yang standby di Peron 3 dan 4, dan Lounge 2 berada di sebelah timur and it serves keberangkatan kereta yang standby di Peron 1 dan 2. Karena Pandalungan tersedia di Peron 4,  gue kedapetan nunggu di Lounge 1.

Petugas di bagian depan bakal nyapa lo dan meminta bukti bahwa lo beneran penumpang kelas Luxury / Sleeper / Priority dkk. by showing your boarding pass. After they grant your access, you're allowed to enter.

- apa aja di dalem situ?

You're presented with banyak banget sofa baik bahan fabric maupun leather (ada di ujung Lounge 2). Selain itu, tersedia TV yang nampilin berita, an abundance of colokan buat ngecas, rak buku samping sofa untuk bacaan, beserta kursi pijat.

- ada wifi?

Di lounge ini tersedia wifi dengan nama sesuai dengan lounge yang ente tempati, contohnya TS di trip kali ini kedapetan di Lounge 2 sehingga nama wifinya Luxury Lounge 2 dan Luxury Lounge 2 5G.

Honestly, sinyal wifinya masi kalah kenceng sama sinyal 5G bawaan hape.

- got snacks?

Di dalam lounge ini terdapat pantry dengan pilihan minum berupa infused water, blackcurrant, dan sebuah coffee machine dengan opsi kopi americano, espresso, dan cappucino dengan its own separate tray for you to add your sugars, creamers, etc. Disampingnya, ada pilihan snack tradisional dan roti. Jujur gue gatau nama makanannya apa aja so mending ente liat sendiri aja di foto yang gue attach.

- services

Honestly, not much that I can cover here. Overall crew is nice but ternyata udah gaada lagi service free porter khusus luxury buat nganterin / bawain luggage kita ke kereta.

3. Pandalungan secara Keseluruhan

KA Pandalungan ini merupakan kereta api yang rangkaiannya full menggunakan gerbong Eksekutif Stainless Steel Gen.1 (2018) lungsuran KA Bima / Argo Semeru. Sejak 1 Maret 2025, KA Pandalungan membawa KA wisata jenis Priority.

Stamformasi KA Pandalungan adalah sebagai berikut :

Lokomotif CC203 - Pembangkit - Eksekutif 1 s/d 4 - Kereta Makan - Eksekutif 5 s/d 8 - Priority


4. Interior KA Priority

I'll be real here, entah gue yang sial, atau KAI Wisata yang engga ngerawat kereta premiernya, but...

What the fuck? AVOD yang terpasang di tiap kursi has seen better days, dan gaada yang bisa dinyalain. Ornamen kayunya tergantung selera masing-masing but not really to my liking.

Tirai jendela yang dipakai beda sama tirai jendela
pada gerbong eksekutif biasa. If it moves and made
contact dengan tembok, itu berisik banget. Combine
that with the horrid ride quality, gue jamin lo
gabakalan bisa istirahat tenang.

Kursi yang digunakan bener-bener sama persis
dengan kursi KA eksekutif lainnya, cuma beda di
warna kulit jok yang dipake. To make matters worse,
dia gapunya legrest kek di gerbong Imperial / kursi Super Executive di bus AKAP. Then, penyangga kaki di kursinya bener-bener sama persis kek penyangga
kaki di gerbong eksekutif biasa.

Overhead compartmentnya macem ruang bagasi di
pesawat, atau kalau kalian pecinta kereta api, mirip
banget dengan ruang bagasi di gerbong eksekutif
buatan tahun 2009 (kaca pesawat) yang dulu jalan di
KA Argo Jati / Gajayana.

Probably the only saving grace is that toiletnya mewah. It's wide, spacious, ada hand dryer, and honestly, enak banget buat setoran alam. The only downside is, tau jendela yang biasanya bisa dibuka di toilet kereta biasanya? It's blocked off here.


5. On Board Services

Onboard, lo bakal dapet 2 kru pelayan dan 1 OTC (on train cleaning) yang dipisah dari kru kereta yang lain. Nothing special about it, to be fair. Di atas kereta, lo dapet fasilitas* aqua botol 330ml free flow, kopi dan teh freeflow dan cemilan keripik. Selain itu, lo bakalan dapet box isinya dua roti dan 2 snack, welcome drink berupa aqua 330ml dan hydro coco, beserta service makan yangmana kemarin menunya nasi sei sapi. Plusnya, makanan berat yang disediakan bisa dihidangkan kapanpun lo mau. In my case, gue minta makanannya dihidangin setelah KA Pandalungan lewat Stasiun Lamongan karena itu udah jam 4 pagi. Minusnya...

I have zero expectations, but damn the food's mid. Daging sapinya cuma macem daging slice yang biasanya ada di AYCE cuma ditumis dalam bumbu lada hitam, and it was cold despite being heated di dalam microwave. For some reason dikasih tahu cabe garam 2 pcs on the side and boy was it salty as fuck. Dikasih juga sayur kailan kering (kalau ente pernah makan ayam jatinangor you'll get the idea) yang berminyak banget sampe ngebikin kailannya soggy. The only saving grace is the sambal matah provided. Not bad, but not what you expect if you pay 1 million rupiah for a train ticket.


6. Ride quality


It's terrible. Imagine gerbong buatan tahun 1981*, dikasih bogie K10 dan dipaksa jalan 120 kilometer perjam, dengan roda bogie peang di kanan belakang gerbong, dan little to no sound deadening. Kalau lo pecinta kereta api, lo tinggal imagine gerbong K1 New Image buatan 2016/17 yang biasanya jalan di KA Purwojaya / Argo Merbabu / Gajayana sebelum ganti Stainless Steel. Rasanya kek begitu, di mana petak Cikarang - Cirebon keretanya bener-bener digeber sampe top speed rasanya kek lagi gempa bumi. Tambah suara rattling dari frame jendela, suara roda peang yang berisiknya kayak mesin cuci under full load, and you'll get a combination yang bakalan bikin lo susah tidur malem. To make matters worse, kereta ini, baik berangkat dari Gambir maupun dari Jember, involves perjalanan malem, sampe gue berani bilang bahwa lebih enak tidur di kelas eksekutif biasanya Pandalungan daripada bayar 300k just for a worse carriage and an overall worse sleeping experience.

*Kode sarananya K1 0 81 04, K1 berarti dia eksekutif, 0 tidak berpenggerak /harus ditarik lokomotif, 81 dia mulai dinas tahun 1981, 04 dia adalah gerbong ekse keempat yang dinas di tahun 1981.


7. Stasiun Pemberhentian

KA Pandalungan (dari Gambir) akan berhenti di stasiun-stasiun berikut :
Bekasi, Cikarang, Cirebon, Tegal, Pekalongan, Semarang Tawang Bank Jateng, Ngrombo, Cepu, Bojonegoro, Lamongan, Surabaya Pasar Turi, Surabaya Gubeng, Sidoarjo, Bangil, Pasuruan, Probolinggo, Klakah, Tanggul, Rambipuji, dan akan mengakhiri trip di Jember.

Untuk lengkapnya, lo bisa cek di (https://keretaapikita.com/jadwal-dan-harga-tiket-ka-pandalungan/)


8. Plus and Minus

Honestly, trip kali ini lebih banyak minus daripada plusnya.

Plus :

- Interior mewah, but ini balik ke personal taste kalian.

- Service snack yang diberikan pas awal kalian naik, dan service makan 1x yang kalian bisa request mau dihidangin pas kapan.

- Freeflow aqua botol, teh, kopi, dan cemilan di atas gerbong, selama persediaan masih ada.

- Luxury Lounge di stasiun seperti Gambir, Surabaya (both Turi and Gubeng) yang free of charge buat penumpang Priority. Equipped with comfy sofas, TV, banyak banget stopkontak, snack, kopi teh free flow, dan free wifi.

Minus

- Kabin KA Priority yang gemblodak dan berisik

- AVOD engga berfungsi, dan TV dalam gerbong engga nampilin informasi yang penting"" banget apart from unwatchable KAI advertisements.

- Suara announcer di dalam gerbong rada kecil

- Kursi setara eksekutif biasa cuma dikasi kulit jok beda warna doang.
- Masih gak dapet bantal, cuma selimut doang.

- Service makan yang leaves a lot to be desired

- Belum ada jasa porter gratis dari Lounge Luxury

- Jarak gerbong Priority yang jauh banget dari Kereta Makan

- Mode malam yang masih terang apabila lo duduk di ujung depan / belakang kereta

- Gangway sempit. Bahkan masih lebih longgar gangwaynya kereta eksekutif. PR banget buat lo yang bawa koper gede.

- Kompartemen bagasi atas yang pake tutup layaknya kabin pesawat, yang unfortunately suka banget ngebuka sendiri pas di perjalanan.

- Keberangkatan dari Gambir yang memposisikan gerbong Priority di buntut rangkaian kereta. Enak buat ngebackride (ngerekam perjalanan kereta dari pintu belakang), gaenak banget apabila lo berenti di stasiun kecil di mana peronnya engga panjang bgt ke belakang kereta, contohnya di Stasiun Klakah dan Stasiun Tanggul.


9. Final Verdict


Apart from some of the extra services, free lounge with free meals and drinks, dan overall ""comfort"", I don't see the point of paying extra 300k buat experience kek gitu. My take? Save your money and naik eksekutif biasa instead. Beli makanan di luar kereta aja, jauh lebih enak dan harganya lebih worth it dibanding beli makanan di kereta / service makan di gerbong Priority.

Overall rating? 5/10. Unless KAI, especially KAI Wisata mau ngerehab dan menstandarisasi seluruh gerbong KA Priority, don't bother wasting your money.

1jrub9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Curious_Current_4325/comments/1jrub9u/not_sure_what_to_make_of_overkill_interview/,Not Sure What to Make of Overkill Interview,"I interviewed for an Office Assistant position. $20-$25 an hour at 30 hours/week. Good benefits. Approximately 70 employees at company. Posting said there would be a blend of HR duties. 

During initial Zoom interview with 4 people, I asked what a typical work day might look like. I was told I would need to get to work early so I could get the coffee going and make sure the lunchroom was tidied up, snacks had been restocked, etc. I was also told I'd need to make runs to the post office, pick up catering, etc. They asked if I'd be okay with this. I indicated I've done this type of stuff before and was good with it. I also asked if there would be other types of work to do & they said yes, there'd be some - like helping with payroll, revamping their online help portal for employees, etc., but they kept coming back to the more menial tasks. 

I then get asked to come in for an in person interview. I say yes. They then send the agenda which is for 2 hours 30 minutes. It includes asking me to prepare and give a 30 minute Power Point presentation showcasing my technical & presentation skills as it relates to the job. I thought this was overkill because if my main job focus is errand running and making sure snacks are stocked why the need for a 30 minute PP in front of 5 people, including the company president, to showcase my presentation/technical skills? I stay positive and think well maybe they recognize from my phone interview that I am capable of more and the role can grow. I decide to really go for it and put a lot of effort into the presentation, which I was told was “amazing.” 

There was also a 30 minute Excel test where I was asked to show I could create bar graphs, pivot tables and do some basic formulas, which I do. There’s also another set of interview questions where they came back again to more menial tasks and asking if I’m okay with things like stocking. & doing inventory. They also spent 30 minutes going over their benefits package in great detail, like to the point of giving an example of how much I would actually pay out of pocket if I bought a $200 pair of eyeglasses. I end up being there for 3 hours.

I did not end up getting a job offer. I ended up feeling like the whole thing was a huge waste of time. What bothers me most, is I felt like if I had presented myself as less skilled and less qualified I would have had a better chance! I realize I am over qualified for the job, but my resume reflected that from the beginning. I’m confused by what they were actually wanting because based on the job description the process was very intense, but given what they were asking for I kept thinking maybe there’s more & this is my chance to shine. I spent a lot of time thoughtfully preparing as I wanted to give the process respect. Also what was the point of going over the benefits in great detail with me if you’re not going to extend an offer? I received no feedback, was just told they selected someone else.

My wife and I are looking into buying a new cordless vacuum.

Can we please have some recommendations?

Basic information: 

* Country: Australia
* Budget: AUD$500, but can try to stretch it up to AUD$600ish or even AUD$700
* Available physical vendors: Harvey Norman, JB-Hifi, The Good Guys, Samsung

About our current vacuum:

* A cheapo 2000w bagless kmart vacuum we bought for AUD$100 maybe 4 years ago.

About our place:

* 2 bedroom apartment, 70sqm2.
* It's probably 10-15 minutes or so to vacuum the whole place.
* Only hard floors. 1 shower mat, 1 large rug. As we have cats, we are actively avoiding carpets.
* 3 cats (2 short hair, 1 medium hair)

Vacuum use:

* Will be used for vacuuming the whole apartment
* Will be used for vacuuming beds.
* Will also be used for vacuuming our car. Standard 5 seats car, but the floor gets covered in dried leaves in just a week or two, sometimes with pastry/cookie crumbs as well.
* Will very likely replace our current vacuum

Currently considering:

* Dyson v8
* Dyson v10 - slightly above our budget. Heard it's a quite an upgrade over a v8.
* Samsung Jet 95 - also slightly above our budget after a 20% enterprise partner discount.
* Dreame Z30 - seems not available locally in Australia. Added this as a tech reviewer I normally watch tried this one in their coffee shop.",1,1743823563.0,VacuumCleaners,1,1.0,False

## Understanding Your cuisinart Coffee Maker Filter Needs

Before diving into specific brands and types, it's crucial to understand your Cuisinart coffee maker's specific requirements. Different Cuisinart models require different filter sizes and types. Take a moment to identify your specific model number (often found on the bottom or back of the unit). Common models like the Cuisinart DCC-3200 filters require basket-style filters, while some older or specialized models might use cone-shaped filters.

Once you've identified your model, determine the appropriate cuisinart coffee maker filter size. The owner's manual is your best resource for this data. If you've misplaced the manual, a speedy search online using your model number will usually yield the answer. Using the correct filter size is critical for preventing overflows and ensuring proper coffee extraction.

Another vital consideration is the cuisinart coffee filter type you prefer.Do you prefer the convenience of disposable paper filters or the eco-friendliness and potential cost savings of a cuisinart permanent coffee filter? We'll discuss the pros and cons of each type in detail below.

## Paper vs.Permanent: choosing the Right Filter Material

The first major decision when choosing a coffee filter is whether to go with paper or a permanent filter.Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

**Paper Filters:**

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Convenience:** Disposable paper coffee filters for Cuisinart coffee makers offer unparalleled convenience. After brewing, simply discard the filter and grounds – no cleaning required.
    *   **Cleanliness:** Paper filters trap most of the coffee grounds and oils, resulting in a cleaner, less bitter brew. They also minimize sediment in your cup.
    *   **Cost-Effective (Initially):** Paper filters are relatively inexpensive upfront, especially when purchased in bulk. Consider a cuisinart coffee filter bulk pack to save money.
*   **cons:**
    *   **Environmental Impact:** Disposable filters contribute to landfill waste. While some are biodegradable, the sheer volume of filters used daily still adds up.
    *   **Potential Paper Taste:** Some lower-quality paper filters can impart a slight papery taste to the coffee.Unbleached cuisinart coffee filters generally minimize this.
    *   **Recurring Cost:** The ongoing cost of purchasing replacement filters can add up over time.

**Permanent Filters:**

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Eco-Pleasant:** A reusable filter significantly reduces waste compared to disposable paper filters. Consider eco-friendly cuisinart coffee filters as a enduring choice.
    *   **Cost-Effective (Long-Term):** While the initial investment is higher,a permanent filter eliminates the need to purchase replacement filters regularly.
    *   **Enhanced Flavor (potentially):** Some coffee enthusiasts believe that permanent filters allow more of the coffee's natural oils to pass through, resulting in a richer, more flavorful brew. Opting for a cuisinart gold tone filter could be a good starting point.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Cleaning Required:** Permanent filters require cleaning after each use. This can be a minor inconvenience for some.
    *   **Sediment:** Permanent filters, especially mesh filters, may allow some sediment to pass through, resulting in a slightly grittier cup of coffee.
    *   **Potential for Clogging:** Over time, coffee oils can build up in permanent filters, leading to clogging and reduced performance. Regular cleaning with a specialized coffee filter cleaner is essential.

## Exploring Permanent Filter Options: Gold Tone vs. Stainless Steel

If you decide to go with a permanent filter, you'll typically have a choice between gold tone and stainless steel. Both offer durability and reusability, but there are key differences to consider.

*   **Gold tone Filters:** These filters feature a fine mesh coated with gold.The gold coating is inert and won't react with the coffee, preventing any unwanted flavors from leaching into your brew. many consider a cuisinart gold tone filter the best way to go.
    *   **Pros:** Excellent flavor preservation, durable, relatively easy to clean.
    *   **Cons:** Can be more expensive than stainless steel filters, gold coating can potentially wear off over time.
*   **Stainless Steel Filters:** These filters are made entirely of stainless steel, offering excellent durability and resistance to corrosion. A stainless steel coffee filter cuisinart will offer years of reliable service.
    *   **Pros:** Extremely durable, easy to clean, generally less expensive than gold tone filters.
    *   **Cons:** Can sometimes impart a slightly metallic taste if not properly cleaned and maintained.

## Finding the Right Fit: Filter Numbers and Compatibility

Once you've chosen your preferred filter material,it's crucial to ensure you select the correct filter number or type for your Cuisinart model. consulting your coffee maker's manual is the best way to determine the correct cuisinart coffee filter number.

If you're using paper filters, you'll typically need to look for basket-style filters labeled as ""4-cup"" or ""12-cup,"" depending on the capacity of your coffee maker. For example, if your machine requires DCC filters, you'll want to search for ""cuisinart dcc coffee filters"" to ensure a proper fit. Similarly, if you have a DCC-3200 model, specifically look for ""cuisinart dcc-3200 filters.""

Be aware that some generic coffee filters for Cuisinart machines may also be compatible.Always double-check the dimensions and shape of the filter to ensure it fits snugly and securely in your coffee maker's filter basket. Reading customer reviews can also provide valuable insights into the compatibility of off brand cuisinart coffee filters.

TLDR: it’s taken 3 trips to a dealer 1.5 hours away to attempt to purchase a used car. On our third trip, we were told we would have to go back a 4th time, due to a salesman’s mistake. Would you still go through with the purchase? 

My husband and I have been shopping for a used Honda CRV for a while. We knew our price range, got a loan from our credit union, and started shopping around. We have been a tad picky with what we want (AWD, less than 100k miles, EXL trim, etc.), but still found some good options. Due to one sale not panning out and 2 weeks of travel putting us out of town, we ended up in a situation where our loan was about 2 weeks away from being void.  

After finding a good option from a well-rated dealer (4.6 stars), we called the dealer and asked them to confirm the availability of a 2019 CRV before we drove 1.5 to look at it. It was available and they told us to come on out, so my husband and I made the drive to check out the car. The car looked good and we were interested, but as it was newly brought into the dealer, it had not yet undergone the dealer inspection. We weren’t told that the car was still not purchasable until we arrived, but that was okay because we knew we’d have to take a trip back for my husband’s trade in. Our salesman told us we could leave a card on file as a “hold” and, pending a clean inspection at the dealer, come back in a day or two to assess our trade in and purchase. 

After we got word of the clean dealer inspection, we drove back 2 days later (another 1.5 hours). My husband left his car to be assessed for trade-in value, and he took the CRV to get an independent pre-purchase inspection. All was good on the PPI, save for a code. The dealer addressed the code with a new battery, and gave us a trade-in value for my husband’s car. We were happy with the price and with the CRV, and we wanted to go ahead with the purchase. We were going to put 7k down cash, and finance a loan through our credit union for 17k. Our credit union was 1.5 hours away, and the dealer wouldn’t accept an overnighted check, so we decided we’d come back a third time with a check in hand to purchase the car. We put down a 1k deposit at this point and signed papers. The dealer agreed to detail the car and fix an external scratch. 

Fast forward 2 more days, we once again made the 1.5 hour drive to finally purchase the car. We arrived at about 6:40 (our salesman knew in advance that we would arrive later in the day, and we were in communication about our ETA) with a certified check in hand from our credit union. The salesman took our check and said the sales manager would take about 30 minutes to finalize stuff. He gave us the keys to look around the CRV. All looked good. We noticed two small dents on the outside of the trunk but decided it was fine. Without us mentioning it, the car salesman said “yeah I noticed those, but when I asked my manager, he said we wouldn’t fix them.” This annoyed us but okay.

After waiting around a bit the salesman returns and tells us “bad news.” The manager couldn’t call our bank to verify our check because our credit union had closed for the day. We were never told the check would have to be verified - keep in mind, our salesman knew the name of our credit union and knew the time we were arriving days in advance. We were told we couldn’t leave with the car without the dealer speaking to the bank to verify the check. We asked to speak to the manager. We explained that we had made the trip 3 times from 1.5 hours away, and that the salesman knew we were coming at that time with a check from the  credit union. The manager said “he wasn’t going to place blame, but [the salesman] did mess up.” He told us we would have to drive back the following morning but that we would be “first in line.” He tried to justify us making a 4th trip by saying “at least you can have another round of free coffee and water,” as if that makes up for our 7.5+ hours of driving. Despite us having 7k cash to put down on the spot, access to our online statements stating the loan, and our salesman knowing the exact situation, the manager said we couldn’t leave with the car and since they didn’t work with our credit union, they couldn’t make any exceptions. He was mildly apologetic but not really. 

This whole situation has put us off, and I feel as if the manager should’ve accepted his employee’s mistake and worked around our situation. Would you still purchase the vehicle despite the whole thing? Should we request some form of compensation for our trouble, like reduced price?

For context, we have known each other for several years now. We’ve always had an interest in each other but never actually dated. She would even text me that she missed me over the years but it never materialized into anything. We recently reconnected over videos I found from years ago of us just talking and having fun. We had a good, engaging conversation after that. 

I got the confidence to ask her to meet up. Here’s how it went:

Me: Would you be interested in going to get some coffee and catch up sometime? I heard the *business name* is good. 

Her: yeah I’d love to

Me: Awesome. When are you free?

Her: um I’m not sure I work all weekend and the rest of this week

Me: That’s no problem because I’ll be out of town over the weekend. How’s Monday at 12:30 sound?

Her: I’m gonna have to see what my schedule is like they should post it this weekend sometime 

Me: Ok no rush. Just lmk and we’ll find a day and time. 

Her: okay:)

That was the beginning of this week. She barley talked to me over the week, even going as long as two day without answering. I get that she has a life too and is not obligated to talk to me all the time. It is just out of character.

I got some really great progress these past 30 days! The first thing I want to talk about is a dynamic back button. In the past, I would link directly back to the scene I wanted the back button to go to. Each time I transition to a new scene, I store that scene path in an array, which I then use for the back button feature.

Another thing I began doing is to create a game design document. Write out all the features I feet like are mandatory before release and then dive deeper into each feature and writing out how I think it should be implemented. Doing this has really helped me iron out some of the more complex features and I will continue doing this moving forward. By spending that 20min of hashing a function out, I get clarity with what I need to try, take note of any aspects that I might not know (and would have to learn) and just prevent myself from wasting time when I am in Godot. Here is a snippet of what I wrote for the back button.

The next feature is something I have been trying to make work ever since I began this app and that is recipe steps. The feature began quite ambitious with draggable variables with unique visuals encapsulating the variables. I tried making it a few separate times and it just was a bit too hard for my skill level. Then I kept lowering my feature standards. Did I need it to be draggable? Nahhh, just use a button that inserts text at the caret. Did it need to have a visual look that is super unique? Nahhh, just use the visual features of a RichTextLabel. Currently the feature uses a LineEdit to capture and save the recipe. Then when you view it, it uses a RichTextLabel with a modified text that replaced the variable placeholders with the recipe variables. It's not perfect but I am quite happy with it for now!

There are lots of other small things like changing variables around (now you input water instead of brewing ratio), made the tweak buttons hide if the changes weren't possible (more than max or less than min values), recipe creation moved, changed sliders to reflect extraction and not the value going up/down and a visual feedback for when a variable gets changed. All solid changes that I think just round out the app a bit more.

I have also been showing the app to more people IRL and it really helps when you see people click and play with your game/app in-person. I often get lost in the sauce when I develop things like this and having mini checkpoints (like this Reddit post and sharing it with friends) is a great way for me to un-sauce myself lol. 

My monthly game chat with the two other peeps keep chugging along and they had a LOT of juicy stuff to show. My Unity bud had rigged a new character with a different art style and done lots of character movement through state machine stuff. My Unreal bud had played around with this bounce feature to give the sense of motion, this rad environment thingy called Genea and a Splatoon like mechanic (of washing off paint). I keep on thinking after each of these sessions how our three game dev journeys are soooo different and I love it haha.

I will probably have one more month of features and refinement before I do a launch of sorts. I already have another app (a memory reflection app) that I want to make. Being able to take the beanbean app through the whole process from idea to publishing is something that I want to do before I begin on that second app. I somewhat understand what needs to be done to publish on the Google Play but still don't know how to do it for iOS (tried downloading Xcode on my old macbook air but it was too old rawr). I should be able to figure that out eventually though.

I'll see ya in another 30 days!",2,1743822639.0,godot,0,0.75,False

150 - weight gain of about 50 lbs since perimenopause doubled down 2 years ago (originally 102 lbs)

Just picked up a new bottle of Adderall from my pharmacy last night. Took my usual three yesterday morning with about 30 ounces of coffee throughout the day. Today, had about 20 ounces of coffee before 9 AM and took my normal three Adderall but took them earlier than usual.

I work a desk job so no manual labor and very low stress. I just got over about two years of crippling anxiety and panic attacks that left me housebound. Couldn’t work a job, couldn’t drive my car.  All happened right after I got my perimenopause and had midlife crisis/breakdown. Found out by process of elimination that the Latuda or Wellbutrin that I was on which used to be miracle drugs for me, had given me serotonin syndrome.  

I stopped and immediately, so did the anxiety. Over the course of the past four months, I have gotten sick frequently. Whether it be a cold, an abscessed tooth, a fever, there hasn’t been one time that I have felt healthy or didn’t question what was wrong with me?  Even the Adderall is becoming ineffective to how disabling the ADHD has become.  It seems like since my hormones changed, I can’t keep my body operational.

Skip to today. I was sitting at my desk and out of nowhere I started feeling like something was wrong. It’s hard to describe, but it was like a feeling of dizziness and the effects of a hangover, even though I don’t drink. My body was buzzing and it’s hard not to compare it to being high on a hard drug or severely manic episode.  My field of vision was disrupted as the sides became black and began to narrow the area in which I could see to a small circle.  I felt like my brain and head were weightless, and my breath had a weird depth to it.  There were even a couple of times where I felt like I wasn’t in control of what my body was doing.  

About 3 1/2 years ago, I got a kidney infection and had to continue to work. I remember thinking that my mind felt so altered due to the infection traveling, I couldn’t believe that they would let me drive and do my job. I felt drunk and hung over and high and dizzy, and I never experienced it again up until today where it wasn’t the same, but it was certainly similar.

Also, I had been fooling my doctor for years into not giving me blood pressure medicine. That all came to a head when I had 174/116 BP observed by The physician. Obviously he was alarmed, but with my history of anxiety and it being an appointment due to a lump I found in my breast, he attributed the high stress situation to the spike. After some breathing exercises and relaxation, we got it down to a 162/102.  I was ordered to monitor my numbers three times a day and go back in two weeks. My first reading was as listed above.

So, if this was an episode of House, what would I have? Is it a mini stroke? Are my kidneys not filtering the toxins out properly? Did my pharmacist roofie my Adderall?

Seriously, though, the perimenopause precipitated changes in everything I knew about my body, but my doctor, who’s a nice enough man, thinks that I’m far too young to be worried about that sort of thing…   I just wanna know if a, any of it is related or be where I should begin and with what doctors.

### Hugo Peñaloza

_by_ [_Meriwether Williams_](https://www.reddit.com/user/cinnamonbicycle/)

[Hugo](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1dtqbv1/rereintro_hugo_pe%C3%B1aloza_the_still_bumbling_son_of/) is one of my first friends I made at Camp over four years ago, so I knew him really well. Here's what he was like. He was the kindest person I've ever met. Actually kind, as in, he would be sad if you were sad--he never ignored you if something was wrong. He smiled all the time and knew how to make everybody laugh and feel included. He would never hurt anybody. And he died for nothing. The real criminal wanted to throw the blame off them, so they murdered an innocent demigod who made the world better for everyone who knew him. Now he's gone. Hugo, we miss you so much. I hope you are safe in Elysium. I know you probably won't see this but my dad delivers the mail and I know he has stops in the Underworld so maybe you will.

_by the Camp Chronicle Team_

Hugo Peñaloza first arrived at camp four years ago. He was a constant positive presence in camp, and could often be seen resting in hammocks, canoeing, and going on jogs around camps. He sewed outfits for his little cousins. He played bass in a band that he founded. He had endless kindness and an unwavering desire to help other people, culminating in him taking on the role as Pandia counselor in 2039.

He was a dearly loved brother and friend, and we will carry his memory with us always.

_Hugo Peñaloza, 19, is survived by his aunt Luisa, his cousins Gabriela and Diana, his uncle Evan, his father Rafael, his godly mother Lady Pandia, his godly siblings Luke Moore, Addisona Yip, Gemma Yip, Stig Henriksen and his friends Meriwether Williams and Caspian Kaito._

### Quest

After several days of thunderstorms in early February, we learned that the cause was a stolen vial. This vial is said to contain the divinity of Lady Nemesis, as [taken during the camp's previous involvement with the son of Lady Metis.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/vvz426/the_son_of_metis_conclusion/)

On February 15, 2040, [Lady Athena and Lord Zelus of the Winged Enforcers visited Camp Half-Blood.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1ipxsfh/three_questers_and_a_funeral/) They revealed that the vial of divinity had been stolen, suspecting the same cultists who had been responsible for orchestrating [the attack on New Argos.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1gcmn70/new_argos_round_two_interrupted/) They tasked Leah Hammerstein, Salem Ashwood, and Fenne Alberink with recovering the vial.

We wish the best of luck to our questers, and hope they will return to camp safely.

### New Argos Attackers: What We Know So Far

*   Cultists in blue and green robes [used underground tunnels](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1hftn4z/the_battle_of_new_argos_the_aftermath/) and portals to [infiltrate New Argos](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1gcmn70/new_argos_round_two_interrupted/), destroying much of the city and its protective walls.
    
*   In particular, these tunnels led to the temples of Hermes, Hebe, Circe, Nike, and Hecate, as well as into the palace.
    
*   A symbol associated with the cultists is [a blue rhombus.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1gcmn70/comment/lwethi7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
    
*   Hugo Peñazola went missing during this battle, along with a multitude of other demigods. Multiple campers searched for him to no avail. He was found at Olympus in mid February, in the same robes as the cultists.
    

This deserves a thorough investigation. We do not know who allowed people into the vault in the first place, as a highly secure region within the home of the gods, or why they might leave one of our own campers behind. We place an immense amount of trust in the Olympians and divine council as arbiters of law and order, and we hope they will address this issue with grace and due process.

### Winter Solstice

In December we were thankful to receive another invitation to [celebrate the Winter Solstice on Mount Olympus.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1hjcgcb/a_visit_to_olympus_winter_solstice_2039/) Much of the mountain had been transformed into a vast ski lodge and Lady Khione was generous enough to freeze a lake for ice skating once again. Campers were invited to explore the area, request a drink from a hosting nymph, or watch the Muses perform a series of plays and musicals from throughout the ages.

As is tradition, many campers had the chance to talk to their godly parents. Admidst tearful reunions and long-delayed conversations, we watched gods and demigods alike grapple with unanswered questions in the aftermath of the New Argos battle. Furthermore, the wind carried rumors of Lord Hephaestus's disappearance, with Lady Techne responsible for running the forge in his stead. We hope to see the god's return to the mountain soon.

### Clowns

All the world's a circus, and all the men and women merely clowns. That's definitely how that quote goes.

Starting in January, several campers were met with clown-themed memorabilia in lieu of the usual job rewards, including clown-themed [lasagna](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1ifrq71/flesh_part_22/), [calamari](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1hx0t3h/closed_rp_stef_and_bailey_deal_with_an/), and [clown toys.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1j8v45c/sphinx_at_barnes_and_noble_job/) The situation escalated into defaced [maps,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1iztyhw/does_anyone_have_a_map_new_map_pt_2/) [cabins,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1j7dntc/job_rogue_centaur_terrorizing_broadway/) and [gazebos.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1j8858u/job_build_a_gazebo/) Some campers [scoured the camp for clues](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1j6u0y7/investigate_the_clowns_job/) or [got educated at clown school](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1jc116k/make_em_laugh_investigating_new_york_clown_school/) in order to unravel the mystery.

[All came to light on April Fool's Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1jorhh0/bingos_bonkers_bonanza/). Lord Comus, god of revelry and merry-making and son of our directors Lady A and Mr. D, was responsible for the replaced gifts and painted graffiti. He claimed his antics on a quest to spread joy and levity through camp and clarify his role as the god of circuses and clownery.

We are glad to have this mystery solved, and hope Lord Comus has enjoyed getting to know the camp community. We hope he receives all the recognition he deserves.

If you see a clown or anything else suspicious in the future, please contact a member of the Chronicle.

### An Interview with Zephyrus

_by_ [_Robert Bridger_](https://www.reddit.com/u/SparkyBirb)

On the [field trip to Olympus](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1hjcgcb/comment/m46vh8x/?context=3\) ) I ran into the bickering wind gods, also known as the Anemoi. During this encounter I got the chance to interview Zephyrus, the God of the West Wind and Springtime.

> ‘’What is your favorite cloud?’’

Zephyrus: ‘’I suppose I have to like all clouds. But if I were to have a favourite, it would be one that isn’t too big or annoying. So I guess I would say Cirrus clouds?’’

> ‘’Have you ever seen or caused a sundog? I know they sometimes appear with cirri.’’

Z: Sundogs? Yeah, I cause them all the time

> ‘’How far do you plan the weather ahead? Do you have plans for spring already, or is it more of a in the moment decision? Do you consult other weather gods for spring weather?’’

Z: ‘’How far do we plan ahead? Can’t say for some, but a lot of planning goes in my end. I’ve got to coordinate with Demeter and Persephone. Like, officially spring starts March 21st. But does it always? Of course not, I’ve got to wait until I have the go-ahead and that means working out when other people do their parts. Much easier for Notus and Eurus honestly. They just turn up when they want to take over.

This spring, I’ve planned it out but you saw the arguments we were having. Boreas wants more time for winter as he has been busy trying to deal with giants pissed at their home being ruined by volcanoes. Notus is worried that means his time is all cold and if it’s cold, he isn’t happy. Aeolus needs to get off his high horse and you know, rule.’’

> ‘’Okay, okay then… How does my dad factor in all of this? I’ve heard someone say he’s your boss, but is that true? Do you work for him or are you more like associates?’’

Z: ‘’Old Aeolus? You know his title as King of the Winds and all that. Effectively he is like our arbiter. Whenever we fight and trust me, we fight a lot. Aeolus is the one who sorts it all out. He can also refer it higher up to Zeus, he doesn’t do that often though. But your old man, he calls fair and foul. Or if something is wrong, he can set the winds going again.’’  

> ‘’What weather plan did you really want to do, but couldn’t because your brothers were troublesome?’’

Z: ‘’Rule of thumb, Boreas and Notus are intense, Eurus and I are more gentle. My plan is start small and just slowly amp it up so you are ready when Notus takes over. Sadly my plans are always dependent on Boreas. Like you can’t just take one of us out. We are all in there.’’

And that concludes my interview with Zephyrus! I’m grateful someone as great as him made time for us!

First Aid Guide
---------------

* * *

* * *

_by_ [_Toby Eversfield_](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheMagePriest)

Hello Camp Half-Blood, this first aid guide has been written to help you support yourselves and others. Please know that while you are at camp, you can always grab help from the medic cabin and we will be there to support you. We can also do a lot more here at camp than we can beyond the border. I’ve written this to help you and assumed you do not have access to nectar, ambrosia or any healing abilities.

It’s always good to be prepared, whether you're hanging out with friends, taking part in sports, or just going about your day. Knowing the basics of first aid can make a real difference when it comes to keeping yourself or someone else safe. Here’s a simple guide to help you deal with common situations that might arise. It’s quick, easy to follow, and hopefully, you won’t need it too often.

### **1\. Cuts and Scrapes**

These things happen. You’re having a great time, and suddenly, there’s a bit of blood.

**What to do:**

*   Clean the wound gently with clean water. If you’re near a sink, wash your hands first to avoid infection.
    
*   Use a clean cloth or gauze to apply gentle pressure if it’s bleeding. Keep it on for a few minutes until the bleeding stops.
    
*   Once the bleeding is under control, apply a plaster or bandage to cover it up.
    
*   If the wound is large or won’t stop bleeding, seek medical help.
    

**When to worry:**

*   If the cut is deep, won’t stop bleeding after 10 minutes, or shows signs of infection (redness, swelling, or pus), it’s time to see a doctor.
    

### **2\. Burns**

Whether from touching a hot pan or spending too long in the sun, burns are unpleasant and need to be treated right away.

**What to do:**

*   Hold the burnt area under cool running water for at least 10 minutes. Don’t use ice – it can damage the skin.
    
*   If that’s not possible, use a cool, damp cloth until you can get to water.
    
*   After cooling the burn, apply a soothing burn cream or gel if available.
    
*   Cover the burn with a sterile, non-stick bandage or cloth to protect it.
    

**When to worry:**

*   If the burn is large, blistering, or deep, seek immediate medical attention.
    

### **3\. Sprains and Strains**

Twisting an ankle or pulling a muscle is all too common, especially when playing sports or running around with friends.

**What to do:**

*   Rest the injured area and try not to move it too much.
    
*   Apply ice wrapped in a cloth to the injury for 15-20 minutes every couple of hours to reduce swelling.
    
*   Compress the area with a bandage, but not too tightly – you don’t want to cut off circulation.
    
*   Elevate the injured area (e.g., prop your foot up on a cushion) to help reduce swelling.
    

**When to worry:**

*   If the pain doesn’t improve after a few days or you can’t move the injured part, it’s best to see a doctor.
    

### **4\. Nosebleeds**

A nosebleed can be a bit alarming, but it’s usually not serious.

**What to do:**

*   Sit up straight, don’t lie down, and lean slightly forward (this helps prevent blood from running down your throat).
    
*   Pinch the soft part of your nose and hold it for about 10 minutes.
    
*   Breathe through your mouth and try not to talk, swallow, or move around too much.
    
*   Once the bleeding stops, don’t pick your nose or blow your nose hard for a while.
    

**When to worry:**

*   If the nosebleed lasts for more than 20 minutes, or if it happens frequently, it might be worth checking in with a doctor.
    

### **5\. Fainting**

Sometimes people faint due to dehydration, low blood sugar, or standing up too quickly.

**What to do:**

*   If someone’s feeling light-headed or faint, help them sit down or lie down with their legs elevated (this helps blood flow to the brain).
    
*   Make sure they’re in a cool, safe place.
    
*   If they’ve fainted, check that they’re breathing and their airway is clear. If they don’t come around in a minute or two, you may need to perform CPR (more on that later).
    
*   Once they’re awake, offer them water and something sugary to help bring their energy back up.
    

**When to worry:**

*   If the person has a head injury, is struggling to breathe, or doesn’t wake up within a couple of minutes, it’s time to call for help immediately.
    

### **6\. Choking**

This is an emergency situation, but it’s easy to deal with if you stay calm.

**What to do:**

*   If someone’s choking, ask them if they can cough or talk – they might be able to clear the obstruction on their own.
    
*   If they can’t breathe or speak, give them five back blows (between the shoulder blades).
    
*   If the object is still stuck, perform the Heimlich manoeuvre (also known as abdominal thrusts). Stand behind the person, place your hands just above their waist, and give quick inward and upward thrusts.
    
*   If the blockage is still there, call emergency services.
    

**When to worry:**

*   If the person becomes unconscious, start CPR immediately and continue until help arrives.
    

### **7\. Head Injuries**

A bump to the head can be tricky, as it’s not always obvious when something is serious.

**What to do:**

*   If the person is awake and alert, keep them calm and still. Apply a cold compress to the injury to reduce swelling.
    
*   If they lose consciousness, even for a few seconds, seek medical attention immediately.
    
*   If they have a headache, dizziness, or nausea, it’s best to err on the side of caution and consult a doctor.
    

**When to worry:**

*   If they have trouble staying awake, seem confused, or start vomiting, get medical help right away.
    

### **8\. CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation)**

If someone’s heart has stopped or they’re not breathing, CPR can be a lifesaver.

**What to do:**

*   **Check if the person is breathing**: If they’re not, call emergency services right away.
    
*   **Chest compressions**: Place your hands one on top of the other in the middle of the chest. Press down hard and fast (about 100-120 compressions per minute) until help arrives. Please note, that you will break the person’s ribs while doing this. It is important you do this to ensure the best chest compressions.
    
*   **Rescue breaths**: If you’re trained in CPR, give two rescue breaths after every 30 compressions.
    

**When to worry:**

*   If you’re unsure, don’t hesitate to call for help and start chest compressions. It’s better to do something than nothing at all.
    

### **9\. Allergic Reactions**

Sometimes, people are allergic to things like food, insect bites, or certain plants.

**What to do:**

*   If you know the person is allergic, and they have an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen), help them use it immediately.
    
*   Make sure they stay calm and try to get them to a hospital as soon as possible.
    
*   If the reaction involves difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, or dizziness, call an ambulance.
    

**When to worry:**

*   Severe allergic reactions can escalate quickly, so if in doubt, call emergency services immediately.
    

**In Conclusion:** Knowing first aid is not just about being prepared for emergencies, but also about making sure that you can help when needed. Don’t panic, stay calm, and always seek professional medical advice when in doubt. If in doubt, it’s always better to be safe than sorry! If you have any questions in the meantime, please come and check in with the medical cabin. We are here to help!

Dear readers,

Welcome to spring!

Many thanks to Disco and Prophet for their ongoing columns within the report, and to our newest writer Leaf for celebrating Hugo. Thank you to Jood, for creating a character who is so easy to love.

Thank you to the mods Rider, Prophet, Dead, Foss, Disco, and Darcel for creating one of the most engaging side plots I've had the chance to be a part of and for crafting a main plot that I still haven't managed to solve (please join us in the discord to discuss theories!). Thank you for new powers, new guides, new gods, meticulously planned games, and a new map! You are all so creative and hardworking and it is such a privilege to have you leading the community.

Thank you to every single person who reads this (and many people who never will) for being part of the sub! It is difficult to write, and it is difficult to share your stories, and I'm glad to be in a space that encourages thoughtfulness, mutual respect, and fun. This season was so full of entertaining moments that I did not have the bandwidth to write full articles for, and I am so excited to see what everyone has in store for spring. Keep doing what you're doing, I'm so glad you're here.

All the best,

Mal

1jrtrl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Stetson_Cole/comments/1jrtrl3/fresh_out/,Fresh Out,"Nobody expected me to graduate any school much less law school, to the extent when I came back to my hometown and saw some of my old classmates in highschool they thought I had been in jail the last 4.5 years but when I started practicing the reality came to be a shocking surprise to them all. My dream has been to ultimately start my own practice, I figured that the vast majority of my clients and cases would be drug related, and I assumed in the way of users and addicts maybe a small time drug dealer would be the biggest I would get. In a small town in the mountains of Kentucky there truly isn't much else other than a few domestics and maybe a murder every once in a while but when it came down to it, the murder is normally tied to one or the other, domestic or drugs, often times both. Being a mere days out of College and having been a member of the Kentucky Bar for an even less amount of time I was not planning on doing much of anything except what I could get my hands on. 

  
The dream of practicing in my home town came crashing down hard on me like a ton of bricks when every firm I went to apply too basically laughed in my face, there is only a few to begin with but lets just say I struck out and leave it at that shall we.

  
  It was mid October my future was looking grim and the money that my grandpa left me was starting to drain out of my account faster than I ever imagined 2 million dollars could. Sure when you think about it especially as a college student that is living off scraps and considers the Dollar Menu a splurge it sounds like a shit ton of money. Then when you get back to Kentucky and find the house that was left to you was in a state of decay that was going to eat up 250 thousand to make it livable again on top of not having anything coming in, your mental state starts to go down hill quickly. 

  
  Sitting on my front porch enjoying a glass of Makers I was certain the sound I heard in the distance was from the brown liquid in my left hand so I dismissed it. Then it grew louder and I couldn't pretend it was in my imagination anymore when I saw this blue and red light bar on top of the SUV coming down my driveway. 

  
  ""Sherriff what can I do ya for?"" I asked as the grey headed man I used to think was an actual giant as a child stepped out of the late 90's Blazer putting his hat on and slamming the door behind him.

  
  ""How ya doin Colt?"" His distinctive eastern Kentucky twang was something I never dreamed I would miss when I went away for college but now I am back I realized why I always hated it, despite the feeling of home it gave me. 

  
  A nod was all I gave him in the way of a response because despite the rapidly increased heart rate that automatically happens anytime I see a car with those specific set of lights on top of it, but I was looking at my childhood best friends father and the look on his face told me he was worried about something and I was too afraid of what he was about to tell me. 

  
  ""Well, I like what ya did with your Pops old place, it's been needing a sprucing up a bit for a while now ain't it?"" Again I nodded at him and reached for my pack of American Spirits trying to curb the sudden wave of stress that had washed over me. 

  
  ""Well I guess I better get to why I came here then, can I sit?"" He didn't wait for me to answer he just came on up the rest of the stairs and sat down in the empty white wicker chair on the other side of the table from me. 

  
  ""I understand that you went to law school? Is that right Colt?"" He had his hat in his hands and his hands were nervously fiddling with the brim of it as he avoided eye contact with me. 

  
  ""Yes Sir, Sherriff Biggs I am a defense attorney although nobody around here wants to hire me onto their firm but I have my degree and license. What's going on Jerry? Is it Justin? Is he in some trouble? God don't tell me he's......""



   His hand shot out and touched my arm just above my wrist. ""God no boy don't you even think about..... Justin is fine, he is getting discharged this week and is coming home actually I am sure you will probably be his first stop before even coming to see me and his Momma. It's Jennifer, she is going to school up there in Louisville and well she seems to have gotten involved with a boy and gotten into some trouble I was hoping that maybe you could take a look at her case and see if there is anything that you can do to help. Me and May will pay you of course, well we are flush with money but I have some put away for emergencies...."" 

  
  I finished my drink and took a drag off my cigarette before flicking it out into the bush that ran along the outside of my porch. 



  ""Yes Sir, you know I will do anything I can to help you and your family but Jerry I have never seen a court room as an attorney I have to advise you that there is certainly someone with more experience than I have that would be able to do more for her. I tell you what, I will go to Louisville tomorrow and see what I can find out. I know a couple guys up there and I will see if they will help her out and then I will talk to them about the fee and see if I can't get them to work out some kind of a deal but we will worry about that later, first we have to find out what we can do to get Jenny out and possibly back home. Did they tell you anything? Do you know what she is being charged with?"" 



  He was looking down at his hat and his hands were still for a second and I saw a bit of a tremble in them, Jerry is 6'7 shy of 300 lb's without a ounce of fat on his body this man was struggling and that is something that I have never seen in my entire life of knowing him. 



  ""Thank you Colt, I want it to be you to represent her, me and your Papaw sat in these chairs here every night while you were gone, He was sitting right there the night I pulled up and found him dead."" Jerry pointed to the other end of the porch where the table and chairs used to sit which is why I moved them to where they were now, I couldn't get rid of them because for my entire childhood they sat on this porch my Granny and Grandpa would start their day with coffee in them and end it with bourbon in them as well. 



  ""He had every belief in the world in you Colt and I do as well, always have sure you've made some fucked up mistakes but God Damn boy me and your Daddy got into a helluva lot more shit than you or Justin could ever dream about....."" 



  The mentioning of my grandpa and then my dad caused me to nearly choke up so I tried to quickly change the topic. 



  ""Ok, Sherriff I will represent her but I will not lie to you if I feel I am in over my head I will call for help from someone else. So they didn't tell you anything about her case?""



  ""No son, they won't even take my fucking calls, something stinks with this and I need you to get to the truth of it."" He stood up and I craned my neck as I looked up at him, the light from the low hanging sun glistened off the tears that were starting to form on his eyes. His hat went onto his head and he took the first step down and stopped but never turned back to look at me. 



  ""Thanks son, I will tell May you send your love and when you see my boy tell him to come see his fucking momma please.""



  The next day I was driving to Louisville and found myself at the court house a nervous wreck as I stood in line for the next available clerk, I looked down at my blue jeans and t shirt and realized I should have at least brough a suit to change into. 



  ""Can I help you sir?""

""Hello! NEXT IN LINE PLEASE!!!"" 



I jumped as I felt a poke in my back from the little old lady behind me, I turned to look at her and saw the annoyed faces at the seemingly endless line of people behind me. Her boney gnarled finger pointed to the window with a beautiful young African American woman sitting behind it, her face looked even more annoyed at me than the people in line behind me that I was holding up.



  ""Yes Ma'am, I am sorry I was off in a dream land. I am the attorney for a Ms. Jennifer Biggs. I need to get the file for her charges and I was hoping you could direct me to where I need to go to be able to see my client."" 



  She sighed so hard the glass window fogged up so bad that it took a minute before I could see that her name tag read Brittany. 



  ""Meet me down there in the attorney room, you see this line is for offenders and family members of people in jail trying to post bail and all that but since I can tell you are new to this court house and by the way you talk you aren't from Lulvul I am gunna help you out anyway!"" 



  When she closed the blinds on her window leaving only one available the line behind me groaned as a group causing an echo through out the otherwise silent court house. Once I was in the room Brittany came in with 3 boxes and sat them down on the table. 



  ""Where are you from anyway country boy? She asked me and smiled for the first time. 



  ""Oh I am from some small town in the mountains, you'd never heard of it.""  
""Do you have your own practice because if so and you are in need of a good paralegal I just so happen to know someone who would be great for you. I mean she lives in here but she is open to moving to the mountains and doesn't have no man or kids tying her down, shoot in fact she doesn't even have any family at all. She wouldn't even care if it is one of those racist ass mountain hollers that ain't never had a black person walk down the street, she is tough and don't scare easy.""



  I was looking through the files as she was talking causing me to only hear half of what she was saying but I got the gyst of what she was saying.



  ""Oh ok well I don't actually have a firm yet I am planning on it but this is actually my first case and client and I only took it because she is my best friends little sister and their dad is the Sherriff and he was also my Dad's old partner who.... Well you don't care about all that but anyway just give me her details and when the time arises then I will give her a call."" I said all the while I was reading through the files and didn't look up until she smacked her hand down on the table the sound of her bracelets clinging against the wood caused my ears to ring slightly. 



  ""Boy you country boys are dumb as fuck!"" She held her hand to her mouth and looked around.



  ""Please don't report me because I will be fired I have already been warned twice about my language and attitude!"" 



  I laughed at her and waved my hand at her, ""Don't worry I won't and who cares if I do. You don't work here anymore, fuck you don't even live in Louisville anymore!"" Her smile grew wide and she jumped towards me giving me a big hug.



  ""Ok! No more of that, I am your boss now! How about we go get something to eat and we can look these over?"" I said and she nodded still smiling ear to ear and held up one finger before going over to the door she brought these boxes out of and disappeared. 



  When she came back she had a jacket and bag in one arm and the other held the door open as she said, ""I genuinely don't give a FUCK Kelly. Deal with it I quit!""



  We are sitting in a coffee shop when she took a file out of the box and we sat down at a table in the corner of this coffee shop in an old building on Main street. 



  ""So obviously I know about this case, I mean I looked into as much as I could without getting caught but I couldn't believe it when you came to my window I had to take my shot, I just want to be honest with you because I know this girl did not do this.""



  ""Wait, what? How do you know about this? They wouldn't even tell her dad who's a County Sherriff, an elected official what she was being charged with. LMPD will not take his calls at all and I was on hold for almost 2 hours on my way here. 



  ""Wow..... You all do have the internet down there right? Please tell me I didn't just commit to moving back to the 1980's""

  
  ""Of course we do and I spent all night looking for anything and couldn't find anything.""

  
  Britt pulled out her laptop and opened it up to her bookmarks where she pulled up a news story.

  
  ""Former Indiana State Trooper was found dead today in the back seat of his pickup truck on state road 57 after police got an anonomus tip by some local hunters. Sherriff's office has one male named Juan Cortina 28 from Loredo Texas and a 20 year old woman who's name has not been released as of this time. The Hancock County Sherriff's Department have declined to go into anymore detail at this time but WKDB have an insider close to the arrest and they have told us that this case is bigger than it seems on the surface.""

  
  ""Hancock County? What the actual fuck?"" I sat back in the booth scratching my head lost for words. 

  
  ""Yeah and get this, they as in Jennifer and this Juan were brought to Louisville because she had a student ID for UofL but she was booked and then released Juan was never booked. In fact he was never even brought into the jail. My roommate's cousin is a CO and was working intake that night and said she was knocked out cold when she was brought in and not like someone knocked her out in a fight or she was drunkenly blacked out but like someone gave her a shot of something. It gets better though because he was taking her finger prints and then someone came in and stopped them by unplugging the fucking finger print scanner and took her to a holding cell and then like 6 hours later she was gone. Jeff you know my roommates cousin said he went to check on her because she was all out of it and whatever when they took her from him and he was hoping he could try to talk to her about what she was doing there because he is a fucking man whore and she is pretty but she is gone and when he asked his commanding officer he said, Jeff sometimes it's best to know when to shut the fuck up and not ask questions you can't handle the answers too.""

  
  Suddenly my head started to pound and I attempted to make it stop by rubbing my temples. 

  
  ""Ok, let's go... Can you get me Jeff's number?"" She waved and helped me carry the boxes to the truck and hopped in the passenger seat. 

  
  ""Come on take me to get my shit and I can introduce you to him."" 

  
  After meeting with Jeff and gathering Brittany's things she and I drove back to the mountains, I couldn't believe the revelations I had just uncovered, I was terrified when I thought she was in some serious drama but this is beyond my imagination. Then on top of all that I just hired a woman I just met. 

  
  I knocked on the door of Brittany's room, I could hear her footsteps as she walked over to open it and let me in.

  
  ""Damn country boy I love this house but I hate to think how many of my ancestors died off the back of building it.""

  
  I sighed as it is always the first question or assumption that is made when people see my families old plantation style home. 

  
  ""My family built this house in 1814, it burnt during the civil war and most of it was gone but they rebuilt it and made it even bigger. Before it was caught on fire it was shot with cannons and bullets essentially it was a target because we were the only family in the entire county that refused to have slaves. I even had family members fighting for the North, two of my Great great whatever uncles were actually double agents spying on the south while posing at confederates. They were some of the richest around Kentucky, Virgina or Tennessee so they were also some of the only college educated men so they were in the inner circle or whatever I don't know it's a long very interesting story I will have to tell you sometime, sorry everyone always assumes we owned slaves but the daughter in law of the Hawthorne that built this house was killed for saving a boys life all because he was black. Plus we would pay our workers, sometimes more than the mines paid theirs so I am sure you can imagine how that went over but I have a question for you Brittany and I need the fucking truth.""

  
  Her face was all smiles as she learned about the fact that she wasn't in a house haunted by the souls of wrong slaves but quickly dropped as I changed my tone causing her to sit on the edge of the bed holding her stomach.

  
  ""You know?"" She said and I pulled the picture out of my back pocket that just so happened to be in a box that she asked me to store in the garage with the boxes of files from the case. 

  
  In the picture was her, a mexican american male and Jennifer Biggs, ""You are all over this case because you are her friend? Did you not think that would be a good thing to tell me?"" I was trying everything to hold back my temper.

  
  ""I didn't want you to think I was too close and my opinion was swayed. I was already working at the court house when all this happened. Jenny had went on a date with Oscar and was supposed to call me when she got home but I never heard from her and when I went to her apartment her roommate was gone, she moved out and I didn't know her full name I only knew her first name Lily and then as I felt as if all was lost there you were and I had to take my chance or at least try. I am sorry Colt, I will get an uber back to Louisville in the morning.""

  
  ""No you won't either, God Damn it Brittany just don't ever lie to me again ok?"" She sniffled and wiped her tears as she nodded 

  
  Suddenly as I opened my mouth to say something else the house erupted with a loud banging from the front door. 

  
  Brittany shrieked in fear as I walked down the back stairwell stopping in my pantry to locate my Smith and Wesson M&P 9mm handgun and tucked it in the back of my waistband. With my right hand holding on tightly to the grip as the holster clipped to my belt I said loud enough for her to hear me over the seemingly constant banging on the old wooden door. 

  ""Lock the door, and don't come out until I call for you!"" She was standing at the railing at the top of the landing looking down the stairs at me. The fear on her face did nothing to mask the natural beauty of her caramel skin and bright green eyes looking back down to me. 

  
  I made my way through the kitchen as the beating at the door grew louder, once I exited the dinning room into the hallway next to the front staircase I slowly made my way to the door peering through the window hoping to get a peek at who it was. 

  
  ""Open the fucking door Colt! It's me!"" Suddenly through the slamming heart beats in my chest that sounded like a war drum in my ears I recognized the sound of the voice on the other side of the door. 

  
  The hinges creaked and moaned as I opened the door to see my best friend Justin standing there looking at me. I reached over and flipped on the lights and stepped to the side to let him in where I was greeted with a hug that lifted me off the floor. 

  
  CHAPTER 2:

  
  ""Wait what do you mean she is gone? Tell me again, who are you?"" Justin said his frustration growing after Brittany and I attempted to relay everything we knew about his sister's case to him. His green Army duffle bag laying on the living room floor between his feet and the coffee table that we had all the paperwork that had anything to do with Jennifer on it which when compared to the three boxes of files, was not many. 

  
  ""So what have you told my Dad?""

  
  ""Well, nothing yet I told him I would call him when I found something out but I genuinely do not know how to explain this to him."" 

  
  Justin reached into his pocket and pulled out his buzzing phone, ""Is that Jerry?"" I asked, my heart rate spiked as I watched Justin who had turned into the version of his father I knew as a kid, 6'7 pure muscle but this one was covered in tattoos and a bit more rough around the edges than his father ever was and I always knew when he decided to follow in the footsteps of our fathers and join the Army that it would happen I just never would have expected him to have went the SF route and then serve out his last contract as an MP. 

  
  Justin got up and walked outside as he took the call, I saw him texting not long after we initially went over what we knew about his sister but I assumed it was not his dad because you know old people and their abilities to never understand technology but considering he is the fucking sheriff I would have known he might be a bit more brighter than your average oldie. 

  
  Justin walked back in and sat down, he didn't say anything despite my constant question ""Was that your Dad?"" He just looked at me and then to Britt and then back to me again.

  
  ""Colt can we step out and have a smoke and talk about something?""

  
  I nodded and walked out behind him, ""Since when do you smoke?"" The bulge in his jaw and the brown puddle left between his boots a good indication that he doesn't smoke at all he was just pulling me out of the ear line of Brittany. 

  
  ""Look Buddy I do not know if we can trust her, you met her hours ago and she fucking lied, I don't get the warm and fuzzies from her man."" 

  
  I held up my hand and told him that I understood and then made the universal sign with my rolling hand to get on with it. 

  
  ""Ok so I called my buddy who works with the FBI stationed in Indiana and he was telling me that the Trooper that they are saying she had something to do with killing was working with some cartels who are also big into race horses. The Sherrif of Hancock County is also in bed with them a guy by the name of Peter Fernandez his birth name is Pablo but he thought he would be better off changing it to an American sounding name but he has been on the DEA radar from day 1 but they can not prove any of the ties he has.""

  
  ""Yeah ok that all makes sense I guess but why the fuck would they take the time to bring her all the way to Louisville where she was apparently drugged and then not charge her?"" 

  
  Before Justin could answer me the storm door slammed shut causing us both to look over and see Brittany standing there with a tablet in her hands. 

  
  ""Uhhh Guys, there is something that you need to see!"" 

  
  She came over to us and pressed play unpausing the video.

  
  ""We come to you live with breaking news, University of Louisville student Jennifer Biggs who was suspected to be involved in the mysterious death of former Indiana State Trooper who's body was found in the back seat of his car in Hancock County earlier this month has escaped from police custody and allegedly killing one Deputy of the Calloway County Sherriff's Department and critically wounding another as they were transporting her here to Jefferson County Detention Center in Louisville Ky. She is said to be wearing jeans with rips in both knees and from the scene it appears that during the struggle with the deputies her shirt was ripped from her body and it is unknown if she is now topless or in her bra but it has been confirmed that she is armed and dangerous. If you have any information that could be considered helpful for law enforcement please do not hesitate to call the anonymous tip line on the bottom of your screen. Police urge you to stay clear of this individual as she has already be involved with the death of two men and the serious injury of another. We will be the first to let you know of this story if there are any more breaks in the case. This has been Gale North, WHAS11 News Louisville Ky.""



  We all shared a look of worry and I had a strong craving for a smoke despite the one lit in between my fingers at that very moment. 



  The red and blue lights shown on the overgrown trees for what felt like an hour before we heard the roar of the engine in the old Blazer as it rolled down the long winding driveway. 



  Justin sat on the steps as soon as he saw the lights and I motioned for Britt to sit in my seat as I went to stand next to Justin.



  Dirt flew around as he skidded to a stop and he jumped out leaving the door open, he wasn't in his uniform this time he was wearing a pair of jeans and a white t shirt his boots untied and his hair disheveled.



  ""What the actual fuck boys? Who is she?"" Jerry said looking first at Justin and I and then to Brittany so again for what felt like the 10000000 time tonight we went over everything we knew, now with Justin's contact in the FBI it seemed as if we were getting somewhere. I had this unnerving feeling that we all shared, a thought going through all of our minds but none of us had the nerve to say it. 



  ""She went from Hancock to Louisville to Calloway? That doesn't make a lick of fucking sense!"" Brittany said finally breaking the silence that filled the entire house, Justin went out to make another call and shut off the lights on his dads truck and then came back in. 



  ""Ok so I have a guy and he has her. He is taking her to his cabin down at Land Between the Lakes and Colt and I are going to go see her tomorrow. Dad I don't want to hear nothing about it you have to stay here.""  
  
  ""What about me?"" Brittany said and Justin gave me a look and I knew what he was thinking. 



  ""Britt I really need you to stay here get everything set up, I am going to leave you my card I want you to go get some computers and all that good shit to make the basement the office I guess we just started our own fucking firm.....""

1jrtnxt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jrtnxt,My Orchids :),"hi all!!

I just started collecting orchids last year when I started working at a local grocery store. Every time I tried to keep them before, they were dead in weeks. For whatever reason I've figured it out. The store I work at normally only gets the moth orchids and gem orchids, occasionally gets the little mini ones, and I usually only rescue the rejects, the discounts, unless it's a special occasion.

The first beauty pictured was a treat to myself in October for getting employee of the month, and she bloomed fully by the first of November. So those blooms are 5 months old, with a new stem with buds popping out. I didn't know orchids could bloom for this long! 

The second one is my personal favorite, Colmanara Massai Red 'Splash' (I'm guessing from previous posts in this reddit.) My hubby and I stopped in at our local Albertsons on the evening of my birthday and I saw her. It was love at first sight and I immediately snagged her and ran to the register. 

The last few are just some others I've collected over the last year, and either they're still full bloom from December, or they're getting ready to bloom for me!

Just for information- I water every 10-14 days, with filtered (room temp or slightly warmer) water with a teaspoon or so per gallon of instant coffee. Then, every 6-8 weeks, I fill a bath tub with warm-ish water, a few teaspoons of instant coffee and a miracle grow orchid fertilizer and set all of my plants in there for about 30 minutes, drain for a couple hours. We live in the mountains in Wyoming, so in a cold and arid climate. I do live near a reservoir, so it's probably not as dry as other parts of Wyoming. I also have some amazon ""grow lights"" I'll turn on for a few days out of the week which seems to keep the girls pretty happy. I've jokingly said that I figured out that orchids are divas and don't want to be looked at or spoke directly at, so I avert my eyes or the blooms fall off ::hahahaha::.  
  
This is simply a brag post, to be able to share with people who appreciate them! We have a plan to move pretty soon, so I may be looking for advice to move abroad with a couple of these guys. Especially the Splashy girl. I've read that if you remove the medium and pack it bare, most foreign countries have no problem with bringing a few house plants in.

# Shelf Life Of Brewed Coffee

Ever wondered how long your brewed coffee remains fresh in the fridge? Knowing the **shelf life of brewed coffee** is essential for every coffee lover. Freshly brewed coffee can lose its flavor and aroma if not stored properly. Let’s dive into the factors affecting its freshness and the best practices for storing it.

# Factors Affecting Freshness

Several factors impact the freshness of brewed coffee. Understanding these can help you maximize its shelf life:

* **Temperature:** Brewed coffee should be stored in the fridge at a consistent temperature. Fluctuations can spoil the coffee quickly.
* **Exposure to Air:** Coffee exposed to air loses its flavor. Ensure it is stored in an airtight container.
* **Light:** Light can degrade the quality of coffee. Keep it in a dark place or opaque container.
* **Time:** The longer coffee sits, the more it loses its freshness. Drink it within a few days.

To illustrate, here’s a table showing the shelf life of brewed coffee under different conditions:

|Storage Condition|Shelf Life|
|:-|:-|
|Room Temperature|4-6 hours|
|Refrigerated|3-4 days|
|Frozen|2 weeks|

# Best Practices For Storage

To keep your brewed coffee fresh for longer, follow these storage tips:

1. **Use Airtight Containers:** Store your coffee in airtight containers. This prevents exposure to air and maintains its flavor.
2. **Refrigerate Promptly:** Place your coffee in the fridge as soon as possible. The sooner you refrigerate it, the fresher it will stay.
3. **Label and Date:** Label your containers with the date. This helps you track how long your coffee has been stored.
4. **Optimal Temperature:** Keep your fridge at a consistent temperature. Ideally, between 35-40°F (1.6-4.4°C).
5. **Avoid Light:** Store coffee in dark or opaque containers. This prevents light exposure which can degrade its quality.

Following these best practices ensures your brewed coffee remains fresh and flavorful. Enjoy your coffee just the way you like it, even days after brewing.

# Signs Of Spoilage

Wondering how long coffee stays fresh in the fridge? Noticing changes in your coffee’s quality can help you decide if it’s still good to drink. Learn how to spot signs of spoilage to enjoy your coffee at its best.

# Smell And Taste Changes

Pay attention to the smell and taste of your coffee. Fresh coffee has a rich aroma and a pleasant taste. If your coffee smells off, it might be spoiled. Here are some key signs:

* **Off Smell:** Spoiled coffee often has a sour or stale odor. It may smell musty or like wet cardboard.
* **Taste:** Fresh coffee should taste smooth and flavorful. If it tastes bitter, sour, or unusually flat, it may be past its prime.

Use your senses to judge the quality. If the smell or taste is unappealing, it’s best to discard the coffee. Here is a quick comparison table for reference:

|Fresh Coffee|Spoiled Coffee|
|:-|:-|
|Rich, aromatic smell|Sour, musty smell|
|Smooth, flavorful taste|Bitter, sour taste|

# Visual Indicators

Visual cues can help identify if coffee has gone bad. Look for any changes in appearance. Here are some signs to watch for:

* **Color Change:** Fresh coffee is typically dark brown or black. If you notice a lighter or odd color, it may be spoiling.
* **Mold:** Mold can form on the surface or inside the container. It appears as white, green, or blue spots. Mold is a clear sign that the coffee should be thrown away immediately.
* **Cloudiness:** Coffee should be clear or slightly opaque. If it becomes cloudy, it indicates spoilage.

Regularly inspect stored coffee to ensure it remains safe to drink. Here’s a checklist for visual indicators:

1. Check the color – should be consistent.
2. Look for any mold growth.
3. Notice any cloudiness in the liquid.

Being observant can help you maintain the quality of your coffee. If you notice any of these signs, it’s best to discard the coffee to avoid health risks.

# Types Of Coffee And Longevity

Have you ever wondered how long your coffee stays fresh in the fridge? The answer depends on the type of coffee and how it’s stored. Different types of coffee have different storage needs, and their longevity varies. Here’s a quick guide to understanding how long your coffee can last in the fridge and keep its best taste.

# Cold Brew Vs. Hot Brew

Cold brew and hot brew are two popular methods of making coffee. Each has a different shelf life in the fridge. Knowing these differences can help you enjoy the freshest cup every time.

**Cold Brew:** Cold brew coffee is made by steeping coarse coffee grounds in cold water for an extended period, typically 12-24 hours. This method results in a smooth, less acidic coffee. Because it is brewed cold and not exposed to heat, cold brew can last longer in the fridge.

* **Shelf Life:** Cold brew can stay fresh for up to 7-10 days.
* **Storage Tips:** Store cold brew in an airtight container to prevent it from absorbing other fridge odors. Always keep it in the coldest part of the fridge.

**Hot Brew:** Hot brew coffee is made by pouring hot water over coffee grounds. This method extracts flavors quickly but the freshness fades faster when stored.

* **Shelf Life:** Hot brew coffee generally lasts 3-4 days in the fridge.
* **Storage Tips:** Use an airtight container to store hot brew. To maintain its flavor, consider making smaller batches that you can consume quickly.

# Instant Coffee Storage

Instant coffee is a convenient option for many. It has a long shelf life when stored properly. Understanding how to store it can help you keep it fresh and flavorful.

**Storage Conditions:** Instant coffee should be kept in a cool, dry place. If you have opened the package, make sure to keep it tightly sealed.

* **Unopened:** Unopened instant coffee can last for years as long as it’s stored in a cool, dry place.
* **Opened:** Once opened, it can last for several months in the pantry. However, for the best taste, use it within two weeks.

Here’s a quick table for easy reference:

|Type of Coffee|Shelf Life|Storage Tips|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Cold Brew|7-10 days|Airtight container, cold part of fridge|
|Hot Brew|3-4 days|Airtight container, smaller batches|
|Instant Coffee (Unopened)|Years|Cool, dry place|
|Instant Coffee (Opened)|Several months|Tightly sealed, cool, dry place|

By understanding these storage methods, you can ensure that your coffee remains fresh and tasty for as long as possible.

# Storing Coffee In The Fridge

Do you often wonder how long coffee stays fresh in the fridge? Storing coffee in the fridge can help preserve its flavor and aroma. However, the way you store it plays a crucial role. Let’s dive into the best practices for storing coffee in the fridge.

# Containers Matter

The type of container you use can significantly impact the freshness of your coffee. Choosing the right container is essential.

**Airtight Containers:** These containers are your best bet. They keep out air and moisture, which can degrade the coffee’s quality.

Sometimes it gets .3 .5 difference. I usually clean it weekly and always use the bellows. Today it got clogged bad. I measure on scale 18.5g and came out 10g. Used bellows and nothing came out. Then I measured 8g and tried again and it got out only 4g. Then used the brush and this much coffee got out. It was crazy. I then opened it all to deep clean it.

He (28M) followed me (25F) to work this morning so that we could have a coffee date together. I work at a coffee shop. However, when I went to open his door and greet him, he was obviously upset. I took a deep breath - because in my experience it could be about pretty much anything. 

Anyways, apparently it was because I let me mom get into his x box so that she could put music on for our daughters while she babysits. She lives with us, and he already had known about me allowing her onto the device for some weeks now. He expressed to me that he’s frustrated that it happened - I told him that I was sorry and that I know he didn’t like that I allowed her onto his account. I assured him that there’s nothing on that device that she could or would want to access - and that it was solely for use for our daughters as it’s their primary screen time device. 

He began to go on about how it is not about her accessing anything on his account - but rather about boundaries. That he believes that I never respect his boundaries and so fourth. I explained to him that I try very hard to understand the things he would and would not get upset about, but that sometimes it can be challenging when he somehow finds something to say that I’ve done wrong on almost a daily basis. That I’ve found myself guarded that no matter what I do or don’t do, it’ll some how upset him. 

He then escalated that it’s not that F ing hard to understand, stay away from his stuff .. on and on. He began cursing loudly at me while I had his car door open in front of my coffee shop so I got in and closed the door. I told him that I often have coworkers outside and that, since he’s expressed he’s a rather private person, he may not want to out himself like that. 

He then proceeded to tell me that if I want to be a smart A about it then he would take it inside and continue to swear at me in front of my workplace. He opened the door and urged me inside. I declined to allow him to bring me inside, as this would be extremely humiliating to me. 

Anyways. It ended with me telling me that he can discuss his boundaries with me, and he can express concerns. But I will not stand for being spoken to like this any longer. And I went inside. 

He apologized over text and asked me to come back out. I cried to him outside telling him that his choice to speak to me this way will effect my entire day. He told me that it will effect his also. As I was walking out of the car again, he called to me “I deserve better”.

*Coffee* Wilton Benite, Colombia - Granja Paraiso 92 P-18 | Sidra Anaerobic Washed - 

Anaerobic Washed coffee with floral notes and: 

Clementine
Rose
Blueberry
Botanicals
Ginger
Bergamot

*Recipe* 8g/130 ml at 205°

Deep 27 pouring structure: medium grind.

One minute bloom.
Pulse pour. Pour and wait to just before bed drains and pour again. Repeat until you  reach 130 ml.

Switch with Mugen 
8 g/130 ml. 
Pour 65 ml and close at 20-25 seconds. 
Pour 65 ml and open at 2:00 minutes

First test was a draw. Picked up floral notes (maybe Bergamot?) Very juicy and pleasantly acidic - light citrus. Great cup for both.

Brewed again, and preferred the Deep 27 for fuller body - rather odd, I thought it would be the other way. Still both were good cups.

Third time much preferred the Switch.

*Conclusion:*

I bought the Deep 27 for it's ability to brew small batches. But the Switch  can match that strength. I didn't know this when I purchased the Deep 27 and perhaps would not have done so. 

But the work flow for the Deep 27 was a bit easier.

 I'll continue to compare the two. I want to try the Switch with the 03 glass V60 and see how it performes.

I'm on travel for a couple of weeks. I took the Switch and Aeropress with me and left about a half dozen other brewers home, for what it's worth.

What are your favorite ways to brew small doses and/or batches?

- The dude on this channel named EMILE the same name as the goat in Severance season 2 breaks down Muppets meta lore into 3 overlapping categories which you can simply replace muppets with Severance themes https://youtu.be/JhmMlYfgits?si=oAXEXYyNFl7qYa0G

Shows first question: Who are you?
- Separate Muppet Theory: Muppets making movies, Muppets on set, muppets in the movies. I’m some movies muppets Star as the muppet they are, in some they Star as their actor, and in others the muppet is credited to the role of a character they are playing. Many actors play several muppets. it’s all very meta…who are you makes sense to ask a muppet with this many layers of identity. In 2011 Movie a muppet named Walter is a fan of the Muppets and watches the movies at home. The Muppets had an ABC series that was a parody of THE OFFICE…like the parallels between Severance to the Offfice and Parks & Rec. A muppet…that’s a fan of watching the muppets. The end of Muppets Movie 2011 is the exact starting frame of Muppets Most Wanted (fireworks that say the end). Severance uses MANY match shots like this and match cuts. EVERYTHING in the muppets movie is just one big movie so that no one can definitively identify any specific character. It’s a messy canon. This whole muppets lore theory is as confusing as it sounds and could go on.
- Kier Eagan looks like Jim Henson - the famous muppets inventor who made Muppets, Sesame Street, Fraggle Rock, Dark Crystal, and many popular works of fiction
- Jim Henson developed his puppetry skills and created his iconic Muppets, including Kermit the Frog, during his time at the University of Maryland and while working on the five-minute puppet show ""Sam and Friends"" for WRC-TV. Jim Henson was working for government television doing his first puppet show. Lumon is connected with government and in many countries just as were The Muppets (who were bought by Disney - a huge multinational corp- some years ago). 
- Animals & People brand in the outro credits is a hand making a shadow puppet of a wolf (along with Red Hour and A Fifth Season Production).
- The original name of the muppets show was Sex & Violence. It was a SNL style show and the name was supposed to be a parody on what the creators of it thought there was too much of on regular night time shows. We see lots of sex & violence in Severance though it’s not the focus. 
- Muppets is one of the most meta shows of all time which had its first major motion picture in 1979 with The Muppets Movie which was followed by many more for decades to follow. Muppets date back to 1955 on their first show produced by the government called Sam & Friends. Over time they refined the characters to who we know today.
- Puppets can’t eat or drink. It makes send that a damaged muppet might drink glue to repair itself from repeated use.
- Puppets are typically controlled left handed due to nature of controlling a puppet. This could explain why when Mark goes into OTC in season 1 that his sense of direction and orientation is all thrown off. He thinks his right is his left and his left is his right. He’s used to being controlled by his innie (puppet) below the stage.
- Muppets is a portmanteau of puppets and marionettes. 
- Mark’s elevator face resembles Kermit’s angry face or when Kermit’s face gets all scrunched up. Mark has a constant cough as if a frog is in his throat. 
- Optics & Design = set dressing and props for emotion like they are setting the stage for how we and the innies are supposed to think & feel with art and manufacturing props with 3D printing like the fake instruments and white mini farm house in the goat room. They are prop items like muppets would use. Non functional and for visual purposes mainly. Muppets is full of props to make a realistic world filled with puppets. 
- Puppets need duplicates as they burn out, get old, have different purposes and outfits needed but puppets cannot simply change clothes like humans. They need puppets for multiple tasks and purpose. Puppets can also become typecast or associated with a character and certain memories and feelings. A puppet that doesn’t fit into the show is thrown out of the rotation and typically doesn’t come back thus killing the puppet - much like the process of being fired in severance.
- To create an identity with a puppet takes practice and time behind the scenes. A puppet doesn’t have any memory and only gets its bearing from the one controlling it who in turn has to think of the thoughts to project through the puppet.
- Lumon and relationship to LIGHTS and lighting being like floodlights as if a puppeteer looking up at their puppet blinded by the stage and spotlights. The puppets don’t exist without the light and the lights are everywhere. Lights, Camera, Action. We see lights all over, cameras all over, and action. This is acting but also clear themes in the show.
- Helly waking up on a table in episode 1 is akin to a puppet laid down on a table after a show.
- Muppet Babies is an animated spin off from the Muppets which came out after Ms Piggy had a baby in The Muppets take Manhattan movie. This spawned the Muppet Babies animated show. The show was designed to reach kids in even simpler language while the Muppets shows generally appeal to all ages with jokes and references that would go over the minds of babies and kids - In Severance babies are referenced all over the show (theres a crawling baby Kier in S2 intro and Dylan has a plush puppet like doll of Kier in his house) including in Season 2’s animated intro with babies crawling all over the place. Milchicks would be like Nanny. The show focused on TEAM building and problem solving. The babies (like innies) dreamed of the lives they would someday lead. Gonzo sees himself as a strong hero like Dylan. The Muppet babies basically had their own ORTBO where the animations of them would be dropped into adventures parodying many movies and scenes with real photographic backgrounds and overlays. Video: https://youtu.be/4VBdHKIt43k?si=PT5KmSnZsORK6kRD

MUPPET BABIES ORTBO above
- People often call actors puppets especially when the actors or celebrities are representing a cause it seems that they know nothing about, that they are simply doing for the money, or which seems to go against their own morals. Meanwhile reflecting on the meta identity focused themes of the show I think it calls in the question if humans in the digital age are actually more authentic behind a screen criticizing someone when they wouldn’t actually do anything to help themselves.

- The 2 grumpy old men muppets, Statler & Waldorf, who are muppets are named after buildings. There are many references to the Lumon building being a living thing from the animated film in S2E1 showing it’s history and growth to the walls telling Mark to stop running in his halls in an angry voice before Mark’s animated character stops and the wall changes its demeanor and says “That tickles”. They are definitely making references that the building is a living place - either bc its full of real people that are helping it grow from the inside out to the outside in or because of some other reason. These grump old Muppets named after real buildings resemble the clothing and style of Lumon. Much of the muppets attire matches Lumon attire. These muppets are meta because they are muppets acting as people while real non-muppet people exist in the muppet universe. Like the layers of innies & outties in Severance. You can have an innie, outtie, an innie/outtie hybrid (Mark) and normal unsevered people.
- In 2016 there was a new Muppets movie with Jason Segal and a red haired actress (resembling mark & Helly) and the muppets rebuilding a broken down theater to make it run again. The first muppets movie was about the muppets in a movie traveling to Hollywood in hopes of making a movie. Very very meta. In the Muppets world humans & muppets coexist naturally - aka humans treat muppets like they see them every day.
- The innie below is the puppeteer of the puppet above as the outtie
- Burt & Irving is just like Burt & Ernie both in the phonetic sound of the names as well as the in the characters, scenery, and some interests (see paper clips Christmas episode of Sesame Street on YouTube). Theres a scene just like muppets Christmas special during Irving’s season 1 OTC looking outside in at Burt with a currently unknown man (not fields).
- Fetid Moppet is a way of saying dirty puppet - look back at Jim Henson original muppets. The first kermit was made out of one of Jim Henson’s mom’s old jackets and a ping pong ball cut in half. A puppet thats used a lot naturally gets dirty with use and this is where the hand goes, typically the left hand to control the face. Mark jokes about his germ ridden larynx in season one and coughs throughout the show. He has his head sewed up and patched multiple times. He drinks glue after having his chip worked on as if a puppet repairing himself.
- Rotation = regular cast of MDR - They only kept certain muppets around for most shows like Kermit (Mark) and they didnt have enough pupeteers for all their puppets so they had multiple people with the same voices play different characters and sometimes rotate from one character to another. They even brought puppeteers in from Tim Burton’s studio as they needed more hands. This matches with why there are so many weird character simularities and moments that make you scratch your head.
- Mark is GIVEN a ROTATING glass hologram of himself in season 1 before we know the history of why it’s just there. The rest of the show is full of different kind of “heads” from Masks & Busks of kier Eagan, to wooden heads in S2E1 intro with replacement MDR, to Milchick’s strange Rabbit/Duck metal desk stand (similar to Gemma’s paper she gets in the mail from the pregnancy center which Mark asks her about before their argument). These heads are everywhere. The end of the show will create 1 Infinite Loop which is a meta reference to Apple’s California headquarters street address and also will make the show hit different (or make more sense) when you watch it again. The first season is both the beginning and the end of a show which will loop infinitely.
- Dr. Teeth is a character of the Electric Mayhem in-house band. Severance has an ongoing theme of teeth from the Mouth Wall, Milchicks perfect smile, Kier Eagans crooked bottom row of teeth (S2E10 finale), and Dr Maur who acts as a dentist (and many other roles including other medical). Dr Teeth is based on the real life musician Dr John. 
- Floyd Pepper is based on the Beatles Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band (another meta concept for this meta show about the Beatles making an album to virtually tour for them), the character is based on saxophone player David FATHEAD Newman. Zoot is a muppet sax player named after Zoot Simmons (real musician). Muppet Janis modeled after Janis Joplin. Animal the muppet named after Keith Moon from THE WHO.
- A puppeteer behind a stage wall will have a weird experience with light, sound, and senses as the spotlight will be on a puppet above a wall in front of them, their hands will be holding a puppet, and they will be kneeling, crawling, or laying down depending on the circumstances.

SENSES THEORY IS SEPARATE BUT CONNECTED TO PUPPETS/MUPPETS THEORY
- Senses theory: this is a long theory but in essence it states the innies are refining senses. In season 1 they refine audio, sound, hearing as there are many vocal abnormalities from strange voices, echoes, strange distorted sound effects. In season 1 they still haven’t refined vision as you see blurry shots all over along with a heavy dark blue tint drenched over almost every shot. Mark’s vision is blurry when he tries watching the TV after work which is chalked up to him drinking but his face is clearly in frame talking to Natalie about someone who became pregnant while severed. They frame marks face perfectly over the shot when it’s not showing a blurry view from his POV. You can hear Mark’s voice here as well. In Season 2 we see much less of that heavy dark blue color grading and many brighter shots throughout the entire season. From season 1 its bright white hallways and clear colors. It hits a major shift with S2E7 with Chikai Bardo when they do the episode showing the rooms Ms Casey goes into and what appears to be Mark & Gemma’s memories which are drenched in sunlight like memories and flashbacks. - Puppets do not have sense and need a human that makes and controls them to imbue them with the appearance of having those senses. 
- Lumon’s hallways are quite literally a Labyrinth like Jim Henson’s famous classic movie. Labyrinths are historically a symbolic way to come back to one’s center. The path the center is simple but many are afraid of going to the center and seeing their true selves. Labyrinths were like a walking meditation, some religious ties. Part of walking labyrinths is learning to let go (like meditations). People often confuse a labyrinth with a maze. A maze is designed to make people get or feel lost or confused while a labyrinth is designed to keep you on a path where you don’t get lost. The labyrinth is a pathway to inner peace. A path to healing…There are walking labyrinths and hand/finger labyrinths which one traces with their fingers (maybe like typing…) There are also hedge labyrinths like hedge mazes as well as light labyrinths designed to be walkable at night or in the dark. Ancient Greek Myth of Knossos and Minotaur with labyrinths and string to find his way back after killing the Minotaur. Example: https://youtu.be/2DPU2w_XCAk?si=o69Dcx_MhTlC0vr9
- Kier law Though Shall Not Render My Creation In Miniature….puppets are practical effects…Jim Henson built GIANT muppets instead of taking the easy way out with green screens or CG. Infamous giant muppet eating house. (also have early muppets that were talking House puppets...yes HOUSE MUPPETS) example: https://youtu.be/HrgNpb_79gQ?si=AHcXveYxCCi0vBUJ

“There is somebody underneath me.” Breaking 4th wall. Innie down outtie up. Kermit explains to Fozzy that they are puppeteers under them and Fozzy can’t understand the concept.
- Puppet stages were a precursor to monitors & SCREENS. The puppet show stage is a sort of screen with curtains around it to hide the puppeteers inside. A box of curtains/ used to hide the hands, strings, and make the story more believable while concealing identity of the puppeteers or marionettes. In time musical accompaniment became paired with puppetry as a high form of entertainment. Puppetry started with Kings & court jesters who were typically working men taken from the job site to entertain the king.

Summary Thoughts

- Ultimately I think the show is steeped in symbolism which is mostly homework, illusions, and distractions to keep people searching for purpose in a real life age and time where people are searching for purpose and meaning. The show is exploring the meaning of identity and identities (plural) in a digital age of disconnectivity. Where we as outties project our emotions/tempers onto a computer screen via social media the innies of MDR react to emotions from numbers (code) they see on a computer screen. They are basically doom scrolling. 

- Meta layers: We have a show, on TV, streaming, on Apple TV, with actors who are playing characters who simultaneously know & don’t know who they are, inside of a business, and outside of a business in a place we do not know. Puppets themselves date back for over a millennium.
----work in progress---
- Season 1 Marks innie gains awareness of his outtie via OTC. Season 2 Mark gains awareness of his outtie through birthing cottages camera conversation.
- Mark allegedly gets severed to forget Gemma who he goes to Lumon and remembers before she's taken away. Mark fills in for Petey after he leaves Lumon with reintegration. In season 2 Dylan's innie is introduced to his love interest Gretchen who then leaves his innie causing Dylan to quit at the same time they have a meeting saying Dylan will be filling in for MDR department chief the same way Mark filled in for Petey in the same wake of emotional turmoil over losing an alleged partner.
- Delaware is the first state of the United States of America. 
- In The Muppets Take Manhattan, Rowlf manages a dog kennel in Delaware. In the comic book adaptation, the kennel is located in Ohio.
- ...More on Delaware, Europe, Zimbabwe (and Equator ""building that's so big"") In *Severance*, the core concept revolves around the separation of work and personal memories through a procedure offered by the fictional Lumon Industries. The show doesn’t explicitly mention Delaware, Europe, or Zimbabwe as having a direct connection, so let’s think about what they might share thematically or conceptually within its framework.
- Delaware, a U.S. state, is known for its business-friendly laws and a high concentration of corporate headquarters—over 60% of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated there. Lumon Industries, a mega-corporation, could plausibly be incorporated in Delaware, aligning with the show’s critique of corporate culture. Europe, a continent with a complex history of labor laws, unions, and industrialization, might connect to *Severance* through its exploration of work-life balance, a theme the show amplifies to an extreme. Zimbabwe, a country that’s faced economic instability and authoritarian governance, could tie in through the show’s undertones of control, exploitation, and the loss of personal agency—workers in *Severance* are, in a way, stripped of autonomy much like citizens under oppressive systems.
- So, what do they have in common in the context of *Severance*? They could represent different facets of the systems and environments that enable or reflect the kind of dystopian corporate control Lumon exerts—Delaware as the legal foundation, Europe as the historical precedent for labor dynamics, and Zimbabwe as a parallel to absolute control over individuals. The show doesn’t directly link these places, but thematically, they resonate with its examination of power, work, and identity.
