One of my best lifelong friends (known each other since we were six) recently had her first baby, and I‚Äôm very happy for her and her husband. She has a large support network nearby of quite a large/close family and extended family (many of whom have kids), and neighbours she‚Äôs close with who also have babies. She messaged me on the day her baby was born and sent photos (adorable), and I replied with my joy/congratulations and other words etc. I also later sent a short voice message, as I wanted to further express my support and just to remind her I‚Äôm here if she needs an extra hand, or help with anything such as groceries or bringing coffee etc.

It has been 6 days and I haven‚Äôt heard anything, so‚Ä¶ I guess I‚Äôm wondering - what‚Äôs it like with a newborn? Is it a totally crazy period of adjustment, emotions, and sleeplessness? I want to be a supportive friend while also not being nosy/intruding at all. Should I be doing more? Or now that I‚Äôve sent messages, is that enough and should I just wait until she feels ready to invite me over to meet the baby? Thanks so much for your perspectives. This is super new territory for me!",1,1741522146.0,beyondthebump,0,1.0,False

How are you doing? Hope you are feeling cosy.

  
I worked in a cafe as a Barista and I have a crush on my customer (always feels like a movie when it happened to me). Usually I just have a crush for fun, but I don't know why I am curious about this one specific customer. He is a very charming guy, I believe he is older than me and into guy as well. Whenever he come to the store I have tried have a convo with him but since the cafe is quite busy, and since I always found myself nervous when I talked to him, it's often just a small talks about his day, the weather, and his coffee order.

  
I would like to know him better... Do you think it is appropriate if I ask for his IG's username or contact? I am a little bit hesitant cos I am afraid I will be seen as a weirdo or a creep by doing so and make the situation awkward haha. What do you guys think?

1j75u5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/loveafterporn/comments/1j75u5c/i_have_tried_so_hard_these_last_few_days/,I have tried so hard these last few days,"2 days ago I shopped for his BD. I prepared food. Yesterday family meal and I cooked. 

During the day I got triggered (before anyone came). So given it was his BD I removed myself and got the last bits of shopping. Event was held and I faked my way through it but the sadness never left me. 

Last night he tried to initiate but I was not in the head space. I asked if he could go to his room so I could cry. He did. Didn't think twice, didn't offer words of support. I cried myselfvyo sleep.

This morning I woke up and found a luke warm coffee next to me. Usually he would give me a kiss and that wakes me up. Not this morning. 

I sent a blunt text. Resulted in him coming in and being nasty but using the text as the reason. I had woke up and decided to be a b1tch to sum up his argument. Mine was you never asked me how I was. He said he'd said good morning but I hadn't responded so he thought I was ignoring him. I was asleep. I didn't hear that good morning. It's the good morning kiss which usually wakes me up. No kiss no wake up. 

I tried so hard leading up to the day to not ruin things. I've not asked questions. I've cried alone. I've dragged my pain through each day alone. I emotionally coped alone. I physically exhausted myself doing things. Not because I wanted any thank you, but to make it as nice a day as I could. 

He is always kind, caring but only when I'm not showing my pain or hurt. He will be overly attentive and very nice but only when I hold things inside. When I get bad, or even just a little hurt it stops. 

For example he is driving to see his parents today. He drove for work last week. His drive for work he sent me lots of texts via voice. He expressed how much he cares etc. Today, not 1 text. He will probably be there in half an hour. But nothing. The only difference is I showed my pain.

I tried so hard not to ruin his BD. Trauma doesn't seem to care what day it is but I do. 

It feels like his old way of conditioning me. But I'm different now. I see through him. I recognise that the first thing he should have done was shown care for how I was. He's very likely on his high horse feeling validated that I started the fight via the text. He's unlikely to see all the effort and thought and emotional effort I went through. He won't think about what could possibly be hurting inside me. He won't want to hear about his porn use affecting me. 

He always did lap up days when he was the center of attention. And yesterday he was.

But I know I tried. I know I tried harder than I have ever. I know internally it made no difference. The only difference was what was on the outside, what he saw. 

I tried. I really did. 

I'm alone today. But I don't feel lonely. I'm not missing him. I'm glad he's away because after this week I'm so emotionally exhausted I couldn't talk it through. I am empty because I tried. 

I'm just a hairs breath away from walking away and accepting I'm unable to get through this. That my trauma has turned me into someone who can't function in a relationship anymore regardless of loving someone. I'm just damaged. Too damaged. ",2,1741520327.0,loveafterporn,2,1.0,False

My cycles continue, but have changed a lot. I've always had some sort of insomnia. I do drink coffee and I do drink wine. Even on the nights when I skip wine, I still struggle to sleep. Some nights I'm OK but when I get around ovulation time or my period , I absolutely cannot sleep. There's nothing I can do nothing I can take no sleep trick. 
 I'm exhausted. I have a nine year-old and a six-year-old and a mother with dementia. I'm stuck in a marriage that we are trying to separate, but until I can get an income after being a stay at home mom we're stuck living together. I do have a lot of stress so I'm not gonna lie that contributes, but I know the hormone is a factor. 

My mother has had a history of strokes and had uterine cancer and had a full hysterectomy. I have no idea when any woman in my family started menopause because they all had hysterectomies. Lots of cancer. I've had migraines on and off my whole life with aura and arm numbness so I've been told I should not take hormone replacement therapy for my symptoms. 
For example, my entire life as long as I can remember before my period, a few nights in a row my heart was just race. I tried to explain this to the doctor and they thought I had a heart problem which if I do, it's not diagnosed. But two or three nights before my period will start, my heart races. It's like drinking 50 Red Bulls. I just got an Apple Watch and was able to document that where my normal heart rate is around 67 to 77 bpm, my heart rate was 104 BPM at midnight. It's horrible. As a horrible feeling.
I am suffering. There has to be something I can take.

1j75s24,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1j75s24/title_plss/,Title plss,"I would miss the sun, the long summer nights. The beach being right on my doorstep. I would miss a lot of things. Chewing the inside of my cheek I stood staring at the sold sign. I had lived in Florida my whole life.
You see it was just my gran and I. My mom died during childbirth and I didn't know my dad. He wasn't really someone we talked about.
""Still staring at that sign, I see"".
Today was another day closer to leaving. She was uprooting us to Texas. Change was good apparently. I didn't want to move, didn't want to start all over in a new place.
My friends were here, my boyfriend was here. For being eighteen my life was pretty good. I got good grades; I had a part time job. I liked where I was at right now. She knew how I felt about leaving but that didn't matter. She had made up her mind.
""Leah, you'll make new friends, you'll get a new boyfriend. We need to do this sweetheart. Change is good"".
I didn't want new friends and I didn't want a new boyfriend. My gran wasn't Tommy's biggest fan. Always insisted something was off with him, didn't like the feeling she got when he was around.
He was my first boyfriend, slightly older but only by three years. But that didn't matter. He had a car, the brightest blue eyes I had ever seen and he was nice to me.
I knew I would make new friends. I would leave regardless if I wanted to or not. I would move on and get on with my life but leaving them behind wasn't my biggest worry.
""My mom's here"". I whispered.
""Sweetheart, your mom's in here"". She placed her hand over my heart. ""No matter where you are or where you go your mom will always be with you"".
I knew she was right but being here, living in this house, it made me feel closer to her.
""How about some hot chocolate and we can watch the sunset?"".
""I'll grab a blanket"".
Another reason why I didn't want to leave. Most nights we'd come out here and watch the sunset. It was kind of our thing. The beach was my favourite place to go. It was my safe space.
Kicking off my shoes I placed the blanket on the sand before taking a seat. The view was beautiful. Staring out into the water a sigh fell from my lips. I would never have this again. Sure, they had beaches in Texas but not this beach and not this view.
""It sure is beautiful"".
""Tommy, what are you doing here?"". I got to my feet.
He shouldn't be here. We said our goodbyes already. Him being here was only making it harder. I looked around for my gran. She tolerated him for my sake but she wasn't his biggest fan. And by that, I mean she really didn't like him.
""We can't leave it like this Leah. I can't believe I'm never going to see you again"". He slipped his arms around my waist. ""I don't want you to go"".
I bit back my tears. I would miss him. We had become inseparable over the last few months.
""You shouldn't have come. You're only making it harder"".
""I'm sorry baby"". His grip around my waist tightened. ""I love you Leah, I love you so much"".
A voice clearing caught my attention. My gran was back.
""I'll see you again. That I can promise you"". He placed the softest kiss on my lips before turning and walking in the opposite direction.
Glancing down at the ring on my right index finger a sob fell from my lips. A promise ring he gave me 6 months into our relationship. He was special, he was good and I was never going to see him again.
""Leah?"".
""I'm okay"". I dried my eyes and cleared my throat. I couldn't dwell on not seeing him again. Her mind was made up. We were moving and it was happening in the morning. ""I need to finish packing"".
Goodbye Florida, hello Texas.
...
We could have flown to Texas but no my gran wanted to drive. A little sightseeing on the way.
20 hours we had been on the road for. Stopping every so often for gas and food. My legs were numb, my bum was numb. I couldn't wait to sleep tonight.
""Texas isn't so bad"". She smiled. ""We're about half an hour away. Go get some coffee"".
I looked around. It may not be bad but it wasn't home. I wasn't sure it would ever become my home.
Heading inside I went straight for the coffee machine. Caffeine was life, I couldn't live without it. As I fixed two cups the door chimed and instantly the hairs on the back of my neck stood.
A strange sensation washed over me; I felt a little dazed but weirdly enough it felt nice. Then I felt it, a presence behind me. My heart rate picked up, the palms of my hands starting to sweat.
This was weird.
Straightening my shoulders, I put the lids on both cups, took a deep breath and turned around.
No one was there.
I frowned. I felt someone or I was that tired I was losing my mind.  Sighing I made my way to the cash register. Today had been a long day.
""Large or regular?"". The girl asked. Her smile bright, contagious even that I couldn't help but smile back.
""Regular and these"". I grabbed a pack of twizzlers opening them right up. I had the biggest sweet tooth. ""Sorry"". I grinned. ""Sweet tooth craving sugar"". Suddenly embarrassed I handed over my money and lowered my head.
Great first impressions.
""That's alright. I'm Alanna"".
""Leah"". Taking my changed I lifted the cups.
""New to town?"".
""That obvious?"". I chewed my bottom lip.
""City girl?"".
""Florida"".
Again, the hairs on the back of my neck stood. The feeling from earlier returning. Only this time I felt hot, flustered even, the feeling of being watched crept in. Maybe I was coming down with the flu.
""I have a feeling you'll like it here. You'll fit right in"". She winked.
Making a face I shrugged. Only time will tell but something was off about this place. From the minute I stepped inside I could feel it.
""How you do not have cavities I'll never know"".
Chapter 2
Closing the car door, I grinned. She knew how much I was addicted to sugar. Passing her coffee, I glanced back at the gas station as we drove away, 4 guys were stood outside staring directly after our car.
Yeah, because that wasn't odd.
""I like sugar"". I grinned sticking another twizzler in my mouth.
""You won't be saying that when your teeth fall out"". She turned onto the highway picking up speed. ""How are you really feeling about all of this?"".
""Ask me again in a month"". I couldn't bring myself to tell her because I didn't want to upset her. She thought this was the best thing for us and I was going to try and make it work.
""I know you weren't big on the idea of moving but I think you'll love it here. All I'm asking is that you try and make it home. Texas is beautiful, the people are friendly and I think we'll fit in perfectly"".
I would give her the benefit of the doubt. I would try but that's not to say it would be easy. Making new friends was, starting over again was hard.
""I'll try but please don't push it on me"".
As the car began to slow down, I became aware of my surroundings. Trees, trees, and more trees.
""Are we living in the forest?"". I asked.
Laughing she placed her hand on my knee and squeezed. ""This is just the road we take. We'll be there soon"".
""Where are the-‚Ä¶"". I paused when houses started to appear.
A street.
""We live in the middle of nowhere, great"". I didn't have a car which meant I was restricted on what I could do. Our new house was located in the middle of nowhere. How was I supposed to go out?
Did any buses run through here?
Sighing I ran a hand down my face as the car came to a stop. I looked up at the house and smiled. The front bedroom had a balcony, just like my old one.
I was in awe.
The house from the outside looked beautiful. A little old and it looked like it had been empty a while but nothing a little love and care couldn't fix.  Maybe living here wouldn't be so bad afterall.
""It needs some work but I had to buy it"".
Stepping inside my heart fell a little. Everything screamed old and out of date. The carpets, the furniture, the smell.
""I have contractors coming in a few days. I know it doesn't seem like much but we can give it a real go out here. Decorate the way we want; we can make this our home"".
She was happy and who was I to take that away from her. My thoughts were irrelevant right now. I had to think of the bigger picture, our future. I wasn't going to burst her happiness over a few old carpets.
""It seems like a quiet area. How far is the nearest beach?"".
""Missing the beach already?"". She smiled.
""I am but I can wait. Do you want me to start unloading the car?"". I was only to bring the stuff I couldn't live without. She was going to buy everything else new. Where she was getting the money from, I will never know and I dare not ask.
""Yes, and I'll see if I can get the heating working"".
No heating?
Rolling my eyes, I made my way outside. Surely it wouldn't get any worse right? With half my body inside the car I didn't hear anyone approach.
""Need a hand?"".
Wait, was that?
""Alanna?"".
""You're moving in there?"". She asked as I pulled myself out of the car. ""You bought that house?"".
I didn't like the feeling in the pit of my stomach. Was there something wrong with it? Kicking the door shut I stared at her. Something felt off about her too and I couldn't put my finger on it.
""Is there something wrong with it?"".
""No of course not it's been empty for a while. I live a few houses down but I mostly stay with my brother. He lives on the corner"".
""Why has it been empty for so long?"". I was curious.
""Not sure"". She shrugged. ""Let me help with that"". She took the box from me and made her way up the driveway. I wasn't sure if we were going to be friends or not. Wasn't sure if I liked her.
""Leah, I managed to get-... oh who is this?"". My gran took the box from Alanna.
""Alanna, she lives across the street. She was telling me this house has been empty for a while. Are you sure you made the right decision with buying it?"". I didn't want her spending all her money on a house if something was wrong with it.
""Leah"". She warned.
That was all I needed to keep my mouth shut. Once she was set on something there was nothing anyone could do to change her mind.
""Go and unpack the rest of the car. I will fix us some hot chocolate"".
""She seems sweet"". Alanna smiled as she grabbed another box.
She was sweet alright but she was also fierce and fearless.
""Thanks, I've got it from here"". I couldn't seem to figure this girl out. I wasn't sure if she was being friendly because she wanted something or friendly because we were new to the street.
""I don't mind"". She shrugged picking up another box. ""Besides my idiot brother has friends over and I'd rather not be there"".
""How old is your brother?"". I asked.
""24 going on 50"". She smirked. ""Bit of an asshole"".
""How so?"". I was digging but I couldn't help but be a little curious.
""I'm sure you'll meet him one day. Do you have any siblings?"".
""Only child"".
Making my way up the drive I tripped over my feet and fell to the ground. Box up in the air I put my hands out to stop my fall. ""Shit"". I groaned grabbing my knee. Lifting my jean leg up I pulled out the stone that was embedded in there.
""Are you okay?"".
Chapter 3
Then I heard the voices.
My hands were bloody, my knee grazed but I'd be fine. A little embarrassed but at least it was dark and no one else saw.
""Need a hand little one?"".
Little one?
""Jake"". Alanna warned.
Glancing up a gasp fell from my lips. Who was he and where did he come from? Wait why didn't he have a shirt on? Was I dreaming? I couldn't look away, couldn't break our stare.
""You shouldn't talk to your older brother like that Alanna"". He finally looked away and I felt like an idiot.
4 guys were stood outside my house shirtless.
It was freezing.
Blinking a few times, I think I may have hit my head on the way down to. Why didn't they have shirts on?
Wiping my hands on my jeans I got to my feet. Everything that was inside the box was now scattered all over the driveway. Sighing I went around picking up all my things.
""Jake, please just go away"". She begged.
He didn't. He stood staring and I was starting to feel a little uncomfortable. That soon disappeared when I noticed what he was holding.
My mom's blanket.
It was old and ragged but it was the only thing I had of hers. I didn't let anyone touch it in the fear it would fall apart. And here he was holding it like some old dishrag.
""Jake"". Alanna hissed.
I was too busy staring at the blanket. I couldn't find my voice to ask for it back.
""Leah, what's going on out here?"". She stood beside me her eyes instantly landing on the blanket. ""Young man I believe what you are holding doesn't belong to you. Give it"". Her voice was stern, it held authority.
His eyebrows furrowed, his eyes landing on mine. ""I apologise"". Handing it over I grabbed it before she could touch it.
I held it to my face my eyes closing. I didn't care that they were watching.
""Come inside the rest can wait until tomorrow. Alanna you are more than welcome to join"".
She didn't need to tell me twice.
""You girls sit, I'll sort some hot chocolate"".
""I'll be back my phones in the car"".
Opening the glove box, I retrieved my phone and made sure the car was locked. What I didn't expect was to find her brother waiting at the bottom of the drive. Tightening the blanket around my shoulder I stopped a few feet from him.
""Alanna is still inside. I'll tell her you're here"".
As I went to walk away, he grabbed a hold of my wrist and pulled me flush against him. I froze. What was he doing?
""Little one"". He growled.
I couldn't breathe.
""Please let me go"". My voice was barely a whisper.
He didn't. Instead, his grip tightened as he buried his head in the nape of my neck and inhaled deeply.
""Fuck baby, you smell like the ocean"".
I was afraid, my body rigid. I couldn't move even if I wanted to.
""You don't have to be afraid of me princess"".
I wasn't aware that I had closed my eyes but by the time I opened them he was gone.
Gone like he wasn't there to begin with.
I was officially creeped out.
Heading back inside I took the cup my gran was offering and sat on the sofa. I couldn't stop thinking about what had just happened. The way he grabbed my wrist, the way he pulled me to him. He sniffed me for petes sake. Who does that?
But weirdly enough even though I was scared I wanted him to touch me again.
""Leah, honey you there?"" My gran laughed knocking me out of my thoughts. ""Alanna was telling me she attends the school you've enrolled into"".
I had forgotten about school.
""Great, school"" Rolling my eyes I sat my cup down. I only had another 6 months and then I'd be finished. But it was 6 months of trying to fit in and not be the new girl.
""Thanks for inviting me over. I have to get home. Leah here's my number just in case you need anything"". Taking it from her I smiled. I knew I was a little sceptical about her before but she was the only person I knew here and I needed someone. ""No need to get up I only live there"".
As I heard the door close I looked at my gran.
""She seems like a nice girl honey, maybe your first friend here. That brother of hers though, He seems like a bit of an asshole"".
I burst out laughing. I always found it funny to hear my gran swear. She was always so reserved, swear words weren't her thing.
""But a good looking asshole"". She grinned.
I had to agree with her there. He was beautiful.
""I already think he likes you"" She winked picking up my cup. ""He couldn't keep his eyes off you"".
""Gran"" I groaned. My gran was my gran but she wasn't ancient. She had my mom when she was 16 so she was still pretty young herself. People always mistook her for being my mom.
""I'm just saying"" She smiled ""Try and get some sleep I know it's not the best but you'll have a bed by tomorrow"".
""I will night gran love you"".
""Love you too sweetheart"".
Chapter 4
I wasn't tired yet. My mind wouldn't turn off. Ever since we got here everything has been weird. From the moment we stopped at that gas station. Taking out my phone I added Alanna's number to my contacts. Opening up a new message I began to type.
'Its Leah, sorry if I came across as a bitch. Didn't mean to be. New town and all that. Thanks for being so welcoming :)'
After hitting send I didn't wait to long for a reply.
'Just a little bit of a bitch lol I'm joking!! Sorry about my brother. Told you he was a bit of an ass but he does have a good heart. Anyways do you want to go for coffee tomorrow? my treat' A x'
I didn't know if I should mention what her brother did or just keep it to myself.
'Coffee sounds good :) you can fill me in on what goes on around here and what you do for fun lol'
Okay so I decided to keep it to myself.
'I'll pick you up at 11. Night Leah, Ax'
Switching my phone to silent I closed my eyes hoping I'd drift off to sleep.
..
I was crabbit.
The couch wasn't comfortable at all, my back hurt and I was in need of a hot shower and some strong coffee.
""Hot water is good to go"". My gran had been up at the crack of dawn trying to get things started on the house. First thing she did was order me a bed. I couldn't sleep on that couch another night. ""Coffee is in the pot"".
""Thanks gran. I'm going out with Alanna at 11 for some coffee. Do you need me to pick you anything up?"".
""I'll be out most of the day anyway honey. I need to get supplies and I'll do a food shop too. You enjoy your day out. How's the hands?"".
""A little sore but I'll be fine. I'm going for a shower I'll see you soon"".
""I'll leave money of the table. I'll be away before you get out"".
I didn't want to leave the shower. The water was roasting and my body was relaxed but if I wanted to be on time I had to get a move on. Wrapping the towel around my body I headed to what will be my room. It wasn't the worst, a lick of paint and some new blinds and it would be as good as new.
Opening my suitcase I pulled out some jeans, a t-shirt, my boots and my leather jacket. After drying out my hair and running my straighteners over it I grabbed my hat and scarf. Autumn was ending and winter was coming. I didn't like being cold but winter was my favourite season of the year.
Giving myself a once over I was ready to go. Hearing the honk of a car I grabbed my bag and phone and headed down stairs. Remembering my money I slipped it into my back pocket, locked the front door and walked to her car.
""Hey"" I smiled.
""Hat and scarf?"" She grinned as she pulled off down the street.
""It's cold outside and it's not that much warmer in here. Jesus Alanna get the heating on"". Don't these people ever get cold? And she was only wearing a sweater.
""Warm blooded"" She winked but turned the heating on for my benefit. ""So I was thinking we'll go for some coffee then I'll take you around the mall sound good?"".
""Sounds good and it beats sitting in the house on my own all day"".
""Your gran out?"".
""Shopping for the house. She just wants everything to be perfect for me, for us"". It was the truth. I've never wanted for nothing in life. She's always made sure I had everything I needed.
""She seems cool for a grandma"" She laughed stopping outside the coffee shop. ""It's not starbucks but it does the best coffee"".
""You had me at coffee"". Unclipping my seat belt I got out and we headed inside. It was small but it was cosy.
""I'll get the coffee you find a seat"". So I did I found us the perfect little booth in the back right next to the window. I loved people watching, I loved to know what was going on around me. As I was watching the world go by my heart skipped a beat when my eyes landed on him.
Jake.
And he was coming in here but he wasn't alone.
""I didn't know what you take so I brought everything"". Placing the cup in front of me I added sugar and some milk. I knew he was watching, I could feel him staring straight through me.
""Hope you don't mind my friend Lacey is going to join us"". Taking off her sweater she sat it on the back of the chair. I matched her movement removing mine along with my hat and gloves.
""That's cool I'm always up for meeting new people"". I made the biggest mistake, I looked over. My eyes caught his but this time I looked away straight away. I didn't like that he had a girl sitting on his lap. I had no idea why I didn't like it. I didn't even know him. I was feeling jealous and that wasn't me.
Why was I feeling like this?
""Just ignore him"".
""Huh?"" I asked my eyes connecting with hers.
""You haven't stopped looking at him since he walked in. My brother has that effect on girls Leah, please don't fall into his trap"".
""It's not that it's-...""
""Hey girls"". this mop of blond hair took the free seat next to Alanna. ""It's going to be a cold winter this year"". Taking off her jacket she smiled at me. ""I'm Lacey it's nice to meet you Leah"".
""You too"".
""I'm going to get coffee and then you can continue your story about how you're not staring at Jake"" She smirked, my mouth fell open. How did she know that, in fact how did she hear any of our conversation?
I was lost for words. Bringing my cup to my lips I took a sip. I was getting hungry and I really wanted some sugar. As if she read my mind Lacey came back with 3 chocolate muffins. My stomach rumbled at the sight of them.
""Dig in by all means"". Taking her seat both girls stared at me as I bit into my muffin.
""What?"" I moaned my eyes closing as the taste of chocolate hit my tongue. ""I'm a sugar junkie I can't help it"". Licking my lips I drank some more of my coffee.
""Oh we're going to be great friends"" Lacey winked ""Now continue talking about Jake and your staring"".
""I wasn't staring"". I huffed both girls gave me the bullshit look. ""Okay I was but it's like I can't help it. It's weird this has never happened to me before it's like I can't look away"".
""Oh god"". Lacey side eyed Alanna but it didn't go unseen. ""Got the bug already and you've only been here a day"". They both started to laugh but I had a feeling they were hiding something.
""I don't even know him and I feel jealous that he has a girl in his lap. This isn't me"". I hated it. I was never the jealous type I never have been. I wasn't that kind of girl. If I was with a boy then I trusted that he was with me and only me. I didn't see the point in being jealous.
But this was different. I don't know what was going on with me.
""Think I'm due my period"". Huffing I began to eat the rest of my muffin. Never once did I look back over there. No matter how loud they were being or how much my body wanted to I never did.
""I'm going for a refill you want another muffin?"". Alanna asked as she grabbed my mug. I wanted to eat the whole damn shop but I decided against it.
""No I'm good with just coffee"".
""He's got a good heart"". Lacey pipped up causing me to look at her. This was the second time I had heard this. I wasn't interested in him and I was never going to let myself get into that position. By what Alanna just said her brother sounds like a player.
""I'm not that kind of girl"". I shrugged. And I wasn't. I didn't sleep around. It took me a full year before I slept with Tommy.
""I know but I'm guessing you may just be what he's been looking for"". Winking at me I glanced over at him. The girl was no longer on his lap and he was glaring at me.
He looked pissed off.
""Okay after we drink these we'll go do some shopping and then we can pick up some booze for tonight"".
""What's happening tonight?""
""We go to the beach on Fridays. Drink some beer, light a fire basically just have some fun and cool off for the weekend. You in?"".
""There's a beach?"". I grinned feeling excited already.
""Yes"" Alanna looked at Lacey and then they both looked at me.
""I'm from Florida the beach was my life. You can bet your sweet ass I'm in"".
""Lets go start our weekend early then"".
Chapter 5
After spending a good few hours in the mall we had decided to head home. It was almost 5pm and they headed to the beach at 7. ""I'll see you guys soon"". As I entered the house my mouth watered at the smell of steak.
In the kitchen my gran was stood at the stove a glass of wine in her hand. The kitchen was spotless and a new cooker had been fitted.
""Something smells great"".
""I'll fix you a plate. Go get cleaned up"".
""Do you mind if I go out for a little while tonight?"". My gran had never stopped me from doing anything but I always did ask for her permission. I wanted to go to the beach but I wasn't big on the idea of leaving my gran on her own in a new place.
""As long as you're in by 2 and you're not drinking then by all means go have some fun"".
I wasn't legally old enough to drink yet but that didn't stop me from having a few. I've never got to the point where I've been wasted. I've always been careful when it came to that. I knew she knew that I drank sometimes but it was never something we discussed.
""I won't be late. Did you get everything you needed today?"". Watching as she plated my steak I couldn't wait to dig in. I was a girl that liked to eat. I loved and breathed food.
""Bed isn't coming until tomorrow I'm sorry Leah it was the quickest they could deliver. Now sit and eat"".
I could survive one more night on the couch.
""Contractors what about them?"". I wanted to know so I could be out of the house when they were here. I didn't want to be in the way when people were trying to do their work.
""Day after tomorrow"".
Cutting into my steak it melted in my mouth as soon as it touched my tongue. My gran was one hell of a cook. ""Everything is going as planned then. Hopefully shouldn't be long until we can call this house our home"".
""Hopefully not honey. I'm going to take this wine and a book to the front porch. I'll see you before you go"".
After freshening up I was stood in my room in a towel staring at my suitcase. I didn't have a clue on what to wear. What did you wear to a beach at night? Grabbing my phone I texted Alanna for some advice.
'What do you wear to a beach at night? x'
Do I wear my bikini underneath? hopefully not in that weather. But I didn't want to be the only girl there not wearing one. I was after all trying to fit in.
'Anything you want but wear a bikini underneath. It can get wild sometimes lol but don't worry we'll look after you ;) come over as soon as you're ready' A x.
Jeans were my life saver and basically the only thing I owned. I had decided on a leopard print bikini but wasn't planning on letting anyone see it. Pulling my hair into a high pony tail I wrapped my scarf around my neck and pulled my jacket on.
Now it was sneakers or boots?
Staring at my white Nikes I sunk my teeth into my bottom lip. If I wear them they aren't coming home white. Glancing at my black ones I shrugged. They'll do.
Kissing my gran good night I headed across to Alanna's house. I could hear loud music and chatter and suddenly I was getting nervous. I hadn't really thought about other people going tonight. I loved meeting new people but that didn't mean I was good at it.
Bringing my hand up I was about to knock when the door opened, Jake was stood with a beer in hand and a glare on his face. What was with the glare? I hadn't done anything to him. He was the one that put hands on me.
He was suddenly pushed out the way Alanna taking his place. ""You look good girl. Come in what do you want to drink?"".
Looking around her house I was in awe. Her house was beautiful. All open plan and full length windows at the back. You could see the forest for miles.
""What are you drinking?"" Taking my coat she tossed it onto the corner couch. Her eyes scanned over my body and suddenly I was starting to miss my coat. I had never been self conscious about my body until I met these girls.
""Leah your body is smoking. I like that this is lace, gives them a little sneak peek of your bikini underneath"". Winking at me she went to get me a drink. It felt like the whole room was now looking at me. Maybe wearing a lace body suit wasn't the best idea. It was tucked into my jeans, nothing inappropriate was showing.
Then I heard it.
A growl or what sounded like a growl tore throughout the room.
Suddenly no one was staring at me anymore. Everyone went back to minding their own business. I don't know what it was but I was thankful.
""Vodka and lemonade with a hint of lime"" She grinned as I took it from her. ""Everything okay?"". She frowned.
""I swear I heard a growl either that or I'm losing my mind"". Taking a drink I walked closer to the back windows. ""Your house is beautiful Alanna"".
""Thank you. Jake designed it along with my dad"".
""I love the windows"". If this was my house I would never leave.
""They worked hard at it. We're having a dinner tomorrow night at my parents. You and your gran should come"".
""I'll see if she's free"".
""You should come. I'll be back in a minute"".
I wasn't moving from this spot until it was time to go. I couldn't get over how stunning the view was. I bet it looked amazing in the summer too. I was starting to feel weird again. It was like I was getting hot flushes but still shivering at the same time. I don't know if going to the beach was such a good idea. I think I was definitely coming down with the flu.
Rubbing at my arms it was then I noticed his reflection. He was staring again, stood in the corner with a glass of brown liquor. It took everything I had not to turn around. The pull was starting to become unbearable and I had no idea what was causing it.
I think the best place for me right now was home.
""Finish up we're heading out"". Passing me my jacket I slipped it on but I didn't make a move to go anywhere.
""Leah are you okay?"" Lacey placed her hand against my forehead. ""You feel hot like you're burning up. Come and sit down"". Taking my hand she sat me on the sofa.
And then she froze.
""No freaking way"" She smirked. ""I knew I was right"".
""What, what is it?"".
""Nothing Leah stay there I'll get you some water. You'll feel better soon I promise"".
Sitting the glass that I had down I got to my feet. I felt slightly better but I still felt a little hot. Walking into the kitchen I heard hushed voices. I didn't want to be rude but I couldn't help but try and listen.
""You know it's rude to listen to peoples conversations"". His voice sounded rugged, deep.
I turned around my gaze meeting his. ""It's also rude to stare but you do it anyway"".
""Watch your mouth little one"". As he took a step forward I took one back. I still wasn't sure about him. I wanted to be near him but at the same time I wanted to be as far away from him as possible. He screamed dangerous.
""Leah you still up for coming with us?"".
""Yes"" I said at the same time he said no.
Lacey smirked. I glared.
""And so it begins"" She laughed but it wasn't appreciated by Jake. If looks could kill she would be dead and buried in the back garden.
I was so confused right now. These people were weird but I kind of liked them.
Hearing the honk of a car Lacey took a hold of my hand. ""Lets go have some fun before the big bad wolf explodes"". I laughed but I didn't have a clue what she was talking about. It wasn't until I was in the car ready to go that I heard it.
It was something I have never heard before in my life.
It was a howl followed by a dangerous growl. It was loud and fierce and it had me quivering, my body shaking. Looking around the car everyone had their heads bowed. Not a word was spoken.
Fear.
Pain.
Joy?
""Hey it's okay"" Lacey whispered taking my hand in hers. ""You feeling better yet?"" Surprisingly I did feel better but I wasn't in the mood anymore.
The cars hadn't moved yet.
""Lacey"".
Who was that? He sounded angry.
""Oh no"" She groaned before the door was pulled open.
""Get your little ass out of that car right now"". He hissed.
""Jack I didn't-..""
""Now Lacey"" He roared cutting her off. This guy wasn't playing around. If Lacey was smart she'd listen to him.
""Beach is off tonight guys and you can thank Lacey for that one"". As she got out he grabbed a hold of her arm and pulled her inside.
Everyone else started to disappear.
I was left sitting alone in the back of someone's car.
Guess it was time for me to go home. What got to me was the fact that no one noticed I was still sat there. That stung a little.
Chapter 6
Getting out of the car I made sure I had my phone and keys. Shutting the door behind me I glanced up at the house. What ever shit happened in there was none of my business. As I got to my front door I turned around for the last time tonight and stared at the house.
It was still early and even though I wasn't feeling that great I was a little bummed about not going to the beach. Maybe I could find it tomorrow and go in day light. Taking off my shoes I slipped off my jacket and placed it over the sofa. My gran was sat at the island in the kitchen with her book. Music was playing softly in the background.
""I thought you were off out for the evening?"" She questioned as she placed her book down.
""So did I"". I shrugged. Opening up the fridge my eyes landed on the strawberries. Taking them out I took the seat opposite her. ""I feel weird"". I couldn't explain it. Maybe I was homesick? ""Do you feel weird?"". Maybe it was being in a different town.
""You feeling a little homesick?"" She asked.
""I'm not sure. Maybe I'm coming down with something"". Taking a few strawberries I put the tub back in the fridge. Today had been overwhelming. Don't get me wrong the people I met were friendly enough but I still had a feeling something was off.
""You'll feel better once you're settled in. New bed tomorrow, contractors the day after and then your first day of school on Monday. Once you get into a routine everything else will fall into place"".
I wasn't looking forward to school but I did have Alanna so that was a bonus.
Lifting my phone I noticed I had a new message.
'Where did you go? Come back over. We're out the back, fire is lit lol it's not the beach but at least there's a toilet. Please come :) Ax'
Staring down at the message I frowned.
""What you frowning at?"" My gran asked looking over my shoulder. ""You should go it's still early and it's only down the street"".
""I don't know"".
""Leah this is your time to make more friends. Get your jacket back on and get over there. You shouldn't be sat in here with me. I'll be having an early night anyway so please go"". She wasn't giving me much room to argue.
""Okay fine but I wont be long"". Kissing her cheek goodnight I grabbed my jacket and my keys and headed down the street. These houses were massive with a lot of room between them.
It was loud.
Everyone seemed to have a good buzz around them. There did seem to be a lot more people than before. Walking in further my eyes landed on Jake. He was sat around with a group of people, everyone was hanging off every word he spoke. Not to mention the girl from the caf√©, she was hanging over him like a bad smell.
""You came back"". Turning around I was pulled into a hug. ""You're so beautiful Leah"". Okay I think she'd had a little bit more drink than she could handle. ""Seriously you're hot. Oh god look at her hanging all over my brother. You'd think she'd take the hint"". Grabbing my hand she pulled me inside. ""Help yourself to anything. I need to pee"".
Taking off my jacket I groaned when I realised I had forgot to change.
""Well aren't you a sight for sore eyes"". He whistled. I froze.
""Excuse me?"".
""You're a hot little thing aren't you"". I couldn't help but laugh. Did he think that was actually going to work?
""That was lame wasn't it?"" He grinned. ""I'm Kane"".
""Leah"". Opening the fridge I grabbed a beer. ""Do you always speak to girls like that? and does it actually get you anywhere?"".
""Ouch"". He smirked. ""Didn't do anything for you did it?"".
""Afraid not"". I shrugged making my way back outside.
He followed.
""So how are you liking it here?"". As we both sat down I noticed we were suddenly getting a lot of attention. Everyone seemed to be interested in what we were doing. Ignoring it I took another drink of my beer.
""This is my second day here"".
""And you've already been invited to one of Jake Taylors parties"". Whistling lowly I frowned. What was that suppose to mean?
""He's a big deal in this town"".
""He's an asshole"". I grinned causing him to laugh.
""I like the way you think Leah"" Hitting his bottle off mine we fell into silence. ""So you're not his biggest fan then?"". I asked.
""Hm I wouldn't say that. I used to date his sister"" He whispered. ""But we're cool we ended things on a good note and it was a mutual decision but I still get the feeling he hates my guts"".
""With they way he's glaring at you I think you may be right"". He hadn't taken his eyes of us from the moment we sat down.
""And that's my queue to call it a night. Hopefully see you around"".
Once again I was left on my own.
""This seat taken?""
""Depends, are you going to glare at me the full time you sit there?"". Glancing up my eyes landed on his. Deep brown eyes stared down at me. It was like he could see into my soul.
""Think we got off on the wrong foot little one"". As he sat down my heartbeat quicken, my palms were becoming sweaty. The pull I had to this man wasn't right but it felt right. I wanted to be near him. I wanted to know him.
""I'm Leah"". I smiled holding out my hand.
""Jake"". Placing his hand it mine it was like something I had never felt before.

When curating the perfect living space, the role of furniture set accessories cannot be overstated. These elements enhance the functionality and aesthetic appeal of your furniture, transforming a simple arrangement into a cohesive and inviting environment. From decorative items to practical enhancements, furniture set accessories play a pivotal role in home decor.

One essential category of furniture set accessories is cushions. Available in a myriad of colors, patterns, and materials, cushions can instantly uplift the look of sofas and chairs. They provide comfort while allowing homeowners to express their style. Similarly, throws and blankets are multifunctional accessories that add warmth and texture to furniture, making spaces feel cozier.

Additionally, functional accessories like coffee table books, trays, and decorative bowls are indispensable. These items not only facilitate organization but also serve as conversation starters. Strategically placed accessories on coffee tables or side tables can create focal points and invite visual interest.

For a more personal touch, wall art and decorative mirrors can be considered as accessories that complement furniture. They provide a backdrop that enhances the overall theme of the space. Choosing pieces that align with your chosen furniture set can create a harmonious atmosphere, making your home feel complete.

Lighting is another critical accessory that amplifies the effectiveness of your furniture. Table lamps, floor lamps, and stylish sconces can create mood and ambiance while serving as artistic statements. The choice of lighting can dramatically affect the perception of color and space within a room.

Incorporating furniture set accessories is also about balancing practicality with aesthetics. By carefully selecting and arranging these elements, you can achieve a well-designed space that meets both functional needs and personal preferences. Whether you prefer a minimalist approach or a more eclectic style, the right accessories can elevate your furniture and enhance your home‚Äôs individuality.

He just turned three months old, and it took me three months to make myself a good cup of coffee. I even drank it before it got cold. Then, I went to the store to grab one thing, just because I wanted another 10 minutes. I played a favorite song on repeat and it felt SO. FUCKING. GOOD. 


I hadn't taken literally even ten minutes to myself since having my baby. Showers? He's in the bath with me or in his bouncer next to the tub. Sleep? We cosleep (as safely as possible and for good reasons, not looking for advice regarding that pls) and he wakes plenty throughout the night. Taking a crap? He's in his bouncer right outside the door so he can see me. Grocery shopping? He's with me, and I have to pray I scheduled it correctly between naps and feeds so he doesn't scream in the store. Need gas/formula/diapers/etc he's with me, because a car ride or my snuggles are the only things that get him to nap longer than 10 minutes.


 I could go on and on, I'm sure plenty of moms and dads relate. 24/7 I am mom now, and it has been so nonstop. I waited 9 months for this fancy coffee, then another 3 months added because I was so busy being mom, I forgot to do a single thing for myself. 


I kept wondering why my post partum depression is only getting worse, well shit maybe it's because I stopped treating myself like a person the day I gave birth?! So if you have a newborn, or any age of babies really, please take ten minutes today to just fucking breathe and enjoy something that's only for yourself.

Little things.

The bathroom light seems dimmer than usual. Maybe the bulb is getting old. The thermostat shifts by a degree or two overnight. Maybe Greg changed the settings. The coffee machine starts preheating a few minutes early. Maybe she programmed it wrong.

Nothing alarming. Nothing worth thinking about. Just life.

A week later, the little things feel‚Ä¶ stranger.

The fridge door is slightly open in the morning, just an inch, but she knows she shut it the night before. The TV is on when she gets home from work, paused on a static-filled screen. The baby monitor glitches, a burst of static that makes the hairs on her arms rise. She frowns at it, presses the reset button. The static crackles, then stops.

Greg jokes about it. Maybe the house is haunted. She doesn‚Äôt laugh.

They paid extra for this system. A completely integrated smart home, everything controlled from one hub, one app. It‚Äôs supposed to make life easier. Lately, though, Melissa feels like the house is off. Not broken. Just‚Ä¶ wrong.

She starts keeping track.

The thermostat adjusts itself at 3:17 AM. Every night. The motion sensor in the hallway logs movement at 2:43 AM. The kitchen lights dim by exactly ten percent every evening‚Äîbut only when she‚Äôs alone.

She tells Greg. He shrugs. Maybe it‚Äôs a software update.

She wakes up at 2:43 AM.

While not indestructible, durable enamel cookware camping sets can withstand the bumps and ‚Äçscrapes ‚Å¢of transport and outdoor‚Äå use far better than more delicate materials like ‚Å¢ceramic or glass.*   **Heat Retention:** Enameled cast iron camping cookware, in particular, excels at‚Å¢ retaining heat. This‚Äå is crucial for cooking evenly and keeping food warm‚Å£ on a chilly evening. Even thinner gauge enameled ‚Äãsteel pots and ‚Äãpans ‚Äãoffer decent ‚Äãheat distribution compared to some other lightweight camping cookware‚Å¢ options.

*   **ease of Cleaning:** Enamel ‚Äçsurfaces are smooth and non-porous, ‚Äãmaking them easy to‚Å£ clean, even ‚Å¢in the absence of running water.‚Äã A quick‚Äç wipe with‚Äã a damp cloth or sponge usually suffices. This is a ‚Äçhuge advantage when you're trying to‚Äã minimize cleanup time at the campsite.

*   **Aesthetics:** Let's be‚Å£ honest, looks matter! Vintage enamel cookware camping sets have a classic, rustic charm that appeals to many campers. The availability of various colors and designs allows you to express your personal style, even in the wilderness.*   **Food Safety:** ‚Å¢Enamelware is generally considered food-safe provided that the enamel coating is intact and undamaged.

So, I (23M) have these three friends‚ÄîAbdullah, Azeem, and Saad‚Äîwho are way too comfortable constantly flexing about their experiences with girls. 

Azeem even has a girlfriend, and all of them have a solid female friend circle. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm an introvert with maybe one female friend (Sara), and even with her, we barely talk.

So every time the four of us hang out, it‚Äôs just them non-stop yapping about their female friends, their ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù experiences, and even their sex lives. And not gonna lie, it makes me feel kinda awkward and insecure because, well‚Ä¶ I have zero to add to the conversation. 

The truth is, I do have sexual experiences‚Äîbut only with female escorts‚Äîso it‚Äôs not exactly the kind of thing I can casually bring up when they‚Äôre out here talking about dates, relationships, and deep emotional connections.

So, it just got to a point where I was tired of being the odd one out, so I did something incredibly dumb‚ÄîI made up a whole girlfriend.

Yep. I told them I was dating this girl named Safa (who doesn‚Äôt exist), and that we‚Äôre in a happy, committed relationship. 

And I have even threw in details like ‚ÄúOh, I was just on a call with Safa‚Äù or ‚ÄúMe and Safa are going out for a coffee‚Äù just to make it more believable. Hell, I even lied about having sex with her just to match their energy.

But now? This has gotten super exhausting as keeping up with this fake relationship has started to feel like a full-time job. 

The worst part is, they totally believe it, and now I feel stuck and for instance if I suddenly say that I‚Äôve broke up with Safa, I know that they‚Äôre gonna grill me about it and if I just keep this up, I might actually lose my mind.

So, what the hell do I do now?

TL;DR: My friends constantly talk about girls, relationships, and sex. I do have an experience, but only with escorts, so I felt insecure and lied about having a girlfriend named Safa to fit in. Now, keeping up the lie is draining, and I don‚Äôt know how to get out of it.",0,1741518147.0,relationships,7,0.33,False

Scientific research suggests that coffee‚Äôs natural compounds, particularly **caffeine and antioxidants**, can boost metabolism, enhance fat burning, and even suppress appetite. But how exactly does coffee contribute to weight loss, and what is the best way to use it for maximum results?

In this detailed guide, we‚Äôll break down the science behind coffee and weight loss, offer expert-backed insights, and provide practical tips for making coffee work for you.

¬†

# 1. Coffee and Weight Loss: The Science Explained

Numerous studies have confirmed that coffee can support weight loss in several ways. The primary weight-loss benefits come from **caffeine**, a powerful stimulant that affects the central nervous system, increases metabolism, and enhances fat oxidation.

Here‚Äôs what science says:

‚úÖ **Boosts Metabolism**: Caffeine increases **resting metabolic rate (RMR)** by 3‚Äì11%, meaning your body burns more calories, even at rest. *(Source: American Journal of Clinical Nutrition)*

‚úÖ **Enhances Fat Burning**: Caffeine stimulates the nervous system to break down fat cells, increasing **fat oxidation** by up to 29%. *(Source: Journal of Applied Physiology)*

‚úÖ **Suppresses Appetite**: Some studies suggest caffeine can reduce hunger hormones like **ghrelin**, helping control cravings. *(Source: Obesity Reviews)*

‚úÖ **Improves Workout Performance**: Caffeine enhances endurance and energy levels, allowing for longer, more intense workouts, which directly contributes to calorie burning. *(Source: Sports Medicine Journal)*

¬†

# 2. How Coffee Affects Your Metabolism

One of the most significant ways coffee aids weight loss is by **increasing thermogenesis**‚Äîthe process where your body generates heat and burns calories. This effect makes coffee a **natural fat burner** when consumed in moderation.

* A study in the *American Journal of Physiology* found that caffeine **increases energy expenditure by 10% in lean individuals and 29% in obese individuals**.
* Caffeine **activates brown adipose tissue (BAT)**, which helps your body burn fat as heat.

This means drinking coffee before workouts or throughout the day may enhance your **body‚Äôs ability to burn calories efficiently**.

¬†

# 3. The Role of Coffee in Appetite Suppression

Hunger is one of the biggest challenges in weight loss, but coffee may help **control cravings** and reduce calorie intake.

‚òï **How does it work?**

* Caffeine affects **leptin and ghrelin**, the hormones responsible for hunger and satiety.
* It may **delay stomach emptying**, keeping you fuller for longer.
* Black coffee has **zero calories**, making it a great alternative to sugary drinks.

üëâ *Pro Tip:* Drinking a cup of **black coffee before meals** can help reduce overall calorie consumption.

¬†

# 4. Best Types of Coffee for Weight Loss

Not all coffee is equal when it comes to weight loss. Some preparations add **hidden sugars and calories**, which can sabotage your efforts.

Here‚Äôs the best way to enjoy coffee for weight loss:

‚úÖ **Black Coffee** (Best Option) ‚Äì No added sugars, milk, or cream.  
‚úÖ **Espresso** ‚Äì Strong and calorie-free when taken without sugar.  
‚úÖ **Cold Brew** ‚Äì Less acidic, naturally sweet, and low-calorie.  
‚úÖ **Bulletproof Coffee (with MCT Oil)** ‚Äì Can be great for keto followers.

üö´ Avoid:

* Sugary lattes
* Frappuccinos with whipped cream
* Artificial creamers and syrups

‚è≥ **Time It Right** ‚Äì Have coffee **30‚Äì60 minutes before workouts** for better performance.  
üíß **Stay Hydrated** ‚Äì Caffeine is a diuretic; drink water to avoid dehydration.  
‚ö° **Don‚Äôt Overdo It** ‚Äì Limit intake to **2‚Äì4 cups per day** to prevent side effects like insomnia or jitters.  
üåô **Avoid Late-Night Coffee** ‚Äì Drinking caffeine late can disrupt sleep, which is crucial for weight loss.

¬†

# 6. Does Decaf Coffee Help with Weight Loss?

Yes! While decaf coffee has much less caffeine, it still contains metabolism-boosting **chlorogenic acids**, which help reduce glucose absorption and improve fat metabolism.

üëâ If you're sensitive to caffeine, **decaf coffee can still aid in weight management** when consumed as part of a balanced diet.

¬†

# 7. The Connection Between Coffee and Intermittent Fasting

Many people combine coffee with **intermittent fasting (IF)** to accelerate fat loss. Here‚Äôs why it works:

üî• **Boosts Fat Burning** ‚Äì Coffee extends the fasting period by increasing metabolism.  
üí° **Reduces Hunger Pangs** ‚Äì Makes fasting easier by suppressing appetite.  
‚ö° **Enhances Energy** ‚Äì Helps you stay active even while fasting.

Drinking black coffee while fasting keeps you in a **fat-burning state (ketosis)** without breaking your fast.

¬†

# 8. Are There Any Risks of Drinking Too Much Coffee?

While coffee is beneficial for weight loss, too much caffeine can lead to:

üö´ **Increased Heart Rate**  
üö´ **Insomnia & Poor Sleep** (which can lead to weight gain!)  
üö´ **Caffeine Dependency**  
üö´ **Stomach Issues (Acid Reflux)**

**Solution?** Stick to **2‚Äì4 cups per day** and listen to your body!

¬†

# Final Thoughts: Can Coffee Really Help You Lose Weight?

Yes! **Science-backed research confirms that coffee can boost metabolism, enhance fat burning, and suppress appetite**, making it a valuable tool for weight loss.

Essential Tips for Choosing a Beach Destination as a Digital Nomad
------------------------------------------------------------------

Finding the perfect beach destination as a digital nomad can be a thrilling yet daunting task. With countless options around the globe, it‚Äôs essential to consider various factors that can elevate your work and leisure experience. Here are some essential tips to guide you in choosing an ideal beach destination.

### Your Work Needs

Before diving into the location options, assess your work requirements. Ask yourself:

- What type of internet speed do you need?
- Will you be working mostly from your laptop or transferring data?
- Do you need coworking spaces or can you work from cafes?

Internet connectivity is fundamental for digital nomads. Certain beach destinations may not have reliable Wi-Fi. Look for locations that have plenty of coffee shops or facilities explicitly catering to remote workers.

### Cost of Living

You want to enjoy the sun and sand without worrying about your budget. Examine the cost of living carefully. Consider these points:

‚Äã -Book Your Perfect Beach Holiday Here-&gt; https://hownow101.github.io/BestBeachHolidays  
- Accommodation: Hostels, Airbnb, or long-term rentals?
- Daily expenses: Food, transportation, entertainment?
- Currency fluctuation: How will it affect your spending?

Some beautiful beaches can be expensive, while others offer a fantastic lifestyle for less. Research and select a destination that fits your financial comfort zone.

### Community Vibe

The digital nomad community can make your experience enriching. Look for destinations known for their friendly expat populations and a robust digital nomad scene. An active community can provide mentorship, support, and opportunities for networking. Here‚Äôs why it matters:

- Meet like-minded individuals to share experiences.
- Participate in events or workshops that can uplift your skills.
- Engage in social activities that allow you to unwind.

For example, popular digital nomad beaches like Canggu in Bali or Tulum in Mexico not only have the right amenities but also a precisely crafted community vibe.

### Accessibility and Transportation

Ensuring easy access to and from your chosen location is vital. Research the following:

‚Äã -Book Your Perfect Beach Holiday Here-&gt; https://hownow101.github.io/BestBeachHolidays  
- Nearest airports and transport options.
- Are there direct flights available from your home country?
- Local transportation: Rideshares, public transport, or bike rentals?

A location that is hard to reach could add stress to your travels. Opt for beach towns with good connectivity and infrastructure to ensure hassle-free commuting.

### Safety and Health Considerations

Your safety and wellbeing should always come first. Assess the following factors while considering a beach destination:

- Local crime rates: Are there areas to avoid?
- Health services: Are hospitals or clinics available nearby?
- Weather conditions: Is the location prone to natural disasters?

Researching health concerns unique to the area, such as tropical diseases, can also be beneficial. The more you know, the better equipped you'll be to handle any situation that arises.

### Local Culture and Activities

A vibrant local culture can significantly enhance your experience. Dive into the local lifestyle by considering:

- Food: Are there diverse dining options?
- Activities: Access to water sports or cultural events?
- Language: Are you comfortable with the local language or is English widely spoken?

Immerse yourself in the local culture to create a richer experience. Engaging with the community and exploring unique local offerings can transform your stay from ordinary to memorable.

### Weather Conditions

Don't forget to factor in the climate. While you may want sunny days at the beach, consider the season and how it affects your work-life balance. Here are key points:

- What‚Äôs the best season to visit for desirable weather?
- Are there extremes in temperature or humidity?
- How does the climate impact outdoor work and leisure time?

Choosing a destination with favorable weather can significantly enhance both productivity and enjoyment. Always check historical weather data prior to planning your trip.

Selecting a beach destination as a digital nomad requires careful consideration of several practical elements. By evaluating your work needs, costs, community vibe, accessibility, safety, culture, and weather, you can find the perfect spot to balance work and relaxation seamlessly.

### Conclusion

Finding the perfect beach destination as a digital nomad can transform your work-from-anywhere experience from ordinary to extraordinary. By exploring the best beaches for digital nomads, you open the door to a lifestyle that blends productivity with the beauty of nature. Whether you prefer the vibrant culture of Bali, the tranquil shores of Mexico, or the community vibe in Spain, each location offers unique opportunities and challenges.

I've known him since preschool, we spent a lot of time together, visited each other as kids, and were classmates in elementary school. We also hung out as teenagers and spent a lot of time together. Despite him being my best friend, nothing ever happened between us, except for one time when we kissed, he then wanted to see and touch my boobs. I didn‚Äôt mind because we had known each other forever. This happened when we were still teenagers. 

The problem is that he started controlling me more and more. I‚Äôd be doing my own thing at home, and he‚Äôd suddenly call saying he wanted to go out, but he was already standing at my door, emotionally pressuring me into going out. Even when I agreed to go out for a short while, just for a few minutes, he always found excuses to keep me out for a long time. If I agreed to have just one beer, it always turned into more‚ÄîI'd tell him I needed to leave, but he‚Äôd order another one at the bar. Or he‚Äôd suggest going for a walk and sitting on a bench, but I already knew he‚Äôd want to go here and there and wouldn‚Äôt take ‚Äòno‚Äô for an answer. He also couldn‚Äôt stand it when I had a different opinion on something. When we talked, he would always stand extremely close to me, which made me uncomfortable. I told him this many times, but he kept doing it. He constantly demanded my attention and wanted to be around me all the time. 

I had enough, so I started acting colder towards him. That‚Äôs when he became even more relentless. I didn‚Äôt know what to do, so I started avoiding him, not replying to his messages‚ÄîI basically ghosted him because I didn‚Äôt know what else to do. But we lived close to each other, so he kept running into me. Then he left for a long time abroad, and I finally had some peace. I didn‚Äôt reply to his messages, I started ignoring his calls, etc. Years passed. When he returned, he sent me a message saying that his mother was dying. But I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to reply because I was already mentally drained from him. Then he happened to see me outside and confronted me, saying he just wanted to talk in difficult times and couldn‚Äôt understand why I had stopped writing to him. So I explained it to him. I felt bad afterward, and shortly after, his mother passed away, leaving him completely alone.

But then he started being pushy again, and I really didn‚Äôt know what else to do except ghost him again. Years passed without contact. He sent me a very long message about his current life, which I ignored. In the meantime, I started feeling guilty about how I had treated him.

 A few days ago, I randomly ran into him again. He immediately reached out to me, asked me to grab a coffee, and even though I had no time at all, I went with him. It was actually kind of nice, and I was happy that maybe this could have a happy ending. I arranged another meeting with him, but after that, he wanted another one right away, then another the next day. He started calling me again, texting, followed me on Instagram (he pressured me , and sending me pictures from his trips‚Äîhim sunbathing at the beach, working out at the gym, showing off his muscles. He started writing about how he talks about me to all his friends. Whenever we were together, he was just as annoying as before, standing extremely close to me, trying to touch me. I‚Äôve had enough of him and don‚Äôt know how to get rid of him. Ghosting again?

EDIT: He can get very angry so I'm kinda afraid. ",4,1741517655.0,Advice,2,1.0,False
1j757n0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1j757n0/my_30f_closest_friend_31f_of_12_years_has_been/,My (30F) closest friend (31F) of 12+ years has been making judgmental and insensitive comments about me and my relationship. How do I go from here?,"TLDR: Friend of 12 years is going through a difficult time. We have both been there for each other through ups and downs. But, she has recently been making comments about my boyfriend being a ""psycho"" and ""nuts"" and about how I am ""nuts."" She recently had a bad experience and is claiming that ""she has always judged girls who let unhealthy guys into their lives"" and has also called me a ""magnet"" for ""creeps."" Not only is all of this not true, but it is incredibly hurtful to hear from the closest person in my life. I am wary that she is going through a difficult period in her own mental health, and I want to be sensitive to that. I don't know how to confront her without destroying the friendship.

This is very difficult for me to type out, so please bear with me. 

For background, I became friends with D (fake initial for purpose of post) during my first week at university abroad. We have been very close ever since, sharing mutual friends and following the same career path. We have been there for each other through countless ups and downs even after we graduated and I moved away. We text and send voice notes on a daily basis and joke that our chat is literally a diary for the past 12 years. I am a very hyper independent person and do not ordinarily reach out to people for help or if I need emotional support. However, D has been there for me through so much without me asking her and she is the only person in my life that I am comfortable reaching out to with a random grievance. 

That said, D tends to stress out over the little things (it is a common joke in our friendship group - with her knowledge) and that is not the easiest thing to deal with. Although it is emotionally taxing, it is something that I have become accustomed to and see as endearing. D also takes on more burdens than she should by caring for people who do not have her best interests at heart and this usually leads to her being hurt in the end. She is also a caretaker to her mother and sister, who deal with mental health issues and who have a destructive effect on her. I myself also put myself into situations when I bite off more than I can chew for other people, often going out of my way for others rather than for myself. 

A few years ago, I went through a difficult marriage and divorce. During that time, D patiently listened to me and was there for me throughout the ups and downs of it all. She listened to me and supported me more than my own family at home did. I would not have been able to make it through that period without her and I will be eternally grateful for it. 

Now, over the past two years, I have been in a relationship that involved a lot of ups and downs and break ups (I'll call him N for the purpose of this post). I know that it is not the healthiest relationship. Other than loving and caring for the guy however, there are logical reasons why I have let the relationship continue. I live at home (in my country, all unmarried people live at their parent's home and it is incredibly taboo not to) with an incredibly difficult mother and family who fundamentally do not understand me. I also do not feel understood by my friends in my country. While I have always been an introvert and enjoyed my own company, I have been feeling incredibly lonely for the first time in my life. I am incredibly successful in my career, which means that I do well with work but the workplace can also bring with it a fair share of toxic office politics. 

N came into my life shortly after my divorce and, even though he is not the best match for me, he developed into the only comfort zone for me in my country. He is the only person in this country that I can truly be myself around. He is non-judgmental and we share very similar day-to-day interests. Our fights, however, have been toxic primarily owing to his own insecurities and anger issues. He has struggled with work and the misogynistic expectations of his parents, which has taken a mental toll on him in life. After urging from my part, he is currently in therapy and working on his mental health. We had numerous toxic breakups and I hate the fact that I am stuck in this cycle. However, I know that he is growing as a person and, for the time being at least, we have been comfort zones for each other. As someone who never admits that I need things, I have come to admit that I need this person in my life. I don't have a 'plan' for where this relationship is going, but for now I am really trying to be kind to myself  - I am battling so much in relation to my own mental health, career, and family that I do not have the emotional capacity to deal with this as well.

In the meantime, over the past year, D has had a very difficult year emotionally and I have been there for her as well. The reality is that she got herself into absurd situations and reacted to them in a way that is 'abnormal' from a mental health perspective. There was a lot that she was not discussing with her husband and instead discussed with me. I am happy to be there for her, but it has been emotionally taxing to do so. For example, while she is in a different time zone, I have her on my 'favourites' so I can answer her calls at all times of night. She has woken me up on many occasions and I have listened as she went on a painstakingly long rant. She is not receptive to advice when I give it to her, so I became accustomed to my advice being discounted and do not express judgment or 'I told you so's' when she wants to talk about the situation over and over again. 

One situation was an emotional attachment she developed to a man who was not her husband. Despite it all, I have understood where this came from and have been there for her, trying to help her detach from him and understanding that it was difficult. I also recognise that the extent of her attachment and how she is coping likely relates to her underlying mental health state. 

While she was dealing with this situation, she repeated a comment a few times that really hurt me. She said: ""I have always attracted good guys into my life and had healthy relationships. And I always judged girls who got themselves into relationships with unhealthy guys, as I thought they were idiots and weak for staying in these drama-filled relationships."" She said this THREE times and I ignored each time. On the fourth occasion, I eventually cut her off and told her to stop deluding herself, that she is lucky to have her husband in her life, and changed the conversation. But, I was genuinely hurt and stopped discussing my relationship with her for some time after that - it is difficult for me to open up to people and I hated feeling judged by the one person I opened up to the most. 

To add to this, she started making more comments. For example, a random professional contact started reaching out to me to ask me for coffee and his approach really bothered me - so I ranted about it to D. Her response: ""You attract so many creeps. I've only had to deal with one of them. For you, they're a personal picture in your life hahahaha."" I felt this was truly MEAN. I wanted to respond with: ""I attract male attention on a constant basis"" but refrained. The reality is that I am an objectively attractive female and have dealt with the cons of getting disproportionate male attention - from constant cat-calling to unwarranted advances to having to put strict boundaries with men in my professional field. The way she reacted to this one innocent rant bothered me so much - I DO NOT attract creeps. I attract a wide range of men in my life. I had one very bad marriage and I do not like feeling judged for it. And, I have a relationship that involves struggles, but the guy is far from a creep - he is a good, decent man who is flawed and so am I. Honestly, I felt like she said it just to make herself feel better about her current situation so, although I thought it was mean, I let it go and did not respond. 

She then decided to share a story about her friend who is being ghosted by a guy who led her on and compared it to her attachment/situationship with the other guy. She then made the comment about how her other friend ""is so strong for not chasing the guy who is giving her mixed signals and is strong enough to have standards...but oh I don't mean to refer to you and N, it just crossed my mind now."" I was fuming - I simply told her: ""I know it has nothing to do with me and N because, for all of his flaws, he was always consistent with me and never wavered in his commitment."" (The relationship developed gradually and, at each stage, he communicated his feelings and told me that he is happy to move at a slower or faster pace based on my preference. He was also always consistent and never hot-or-cold - on the contrary, I was the avoidant one). She just responded with: ""at least there's that."" 

Over the past few weeks in particular, I have been struggling with a very high workload and long hours, coupled with my Mum being a nightmare and me being uncomfortable at home. D knows that N is my comfort zone in all of this - he lets me be me and is there for me when I need him. Also, D has been spiralling a lot and I have been there for her, which adds to how emotionally drained I have been lately (although I never said this to her as I want to be there for her). She nevertheless has made comments about N ""being crazy"" and ""being a psycho"" and that ""I am too good for him."" I find these comments to be unwarranted and insensitive - she knows that I love him and surely there would be better ways to express her concerns. There are concerns in the relationship due to his insecurities and temper, but he has never reached a level close to violence or made me feel unsafe. 

The day before yesterday, I sent her a voice note saying that I enjoyed my night for the first time in ages - took some time off of work and chilled with N. N has recently dealt with issues with his parents and I was conveying how maturely he is dealing with it all. We also talked about our relationship and I conveyed to her those conversations, which I felt got us closer and made me feel comfortable. I had later messaged her that I am really struggling with work and that he is the only safe space I have. In the voice note, I gave an account of how he said something along the lines of: ""I've slipped up in the past by saying these I shouldn't have out of my own stupidity and ignorance in dealing with things, but I'm working on it. And while I may be stupid at times, I will never do anything to hurt you and to hurt the bond that we are building together, which means so much to me."" She sent angry messages calling me ""stupid"" and ""idiotic"" and saying ""I should thank him for telling me that he will make mistakes again in the future."" (Um, duh - I know he's working on himself, but I'm not naive enough to believe he will never make mistakes again...what I do care about, however, is his accountability, his good intent, and that he is working on it.) She sent more angry messages saying: ""HE IS NUTS! YOU ARE NUTS!"" She continued to call him ""crazy,"" ""nuts"" and that I'm being ""stupid"" and that ""I know what I need to do."" She then said ""This is nuts. God help you both."" 

I have not been able to speak to her since. She then continued to send me pictures of her on vacation with her husband and content about international women's day casually...I cannot bring myself to respond. I am so deeply hurt. First, I do not think it is fair for her to call someone who I love and care about to be ""nuts"" or ""crazy"" or any of her other terms. Even if she has concerns, there is surely a more empathetic way to put it. Second, just the day before, I had listened to her rant about her husband's anger and mood issues - as always, I listen patiently and try to give caring and cautious advice. Not once did I describe her husband negatively. Not once did I describe her own mental health issues negatively, even though many people may objectively describe her emotional affair and other conduct as being ""nuts."" Third, I was talking about what a difficult time I was going through - surely she could have avoided adding to it and left her concerns for another time. Fourth, I can't help but feel like there is a lot of judgment and pretentiousness, which seems to be underlying her discussions with me. I feel incredibly judged by the one person who I've opened up the most to. She is the only person who I discuss my relationship and mental health with. Yes, she has a great husband and is incredibly successful in her career, but I don't think that gives her the right to lord herself over others and not me as her friend. 

If you've read this far, thank you. Any advice on how to deal with this would be greatly appreciated. I am debating whether to confront her or just let it go for the sake of the friendship. I feel like I won't be able to confront her without me saying something that she will take personally and which will forever damage our friendship.

## Different Types of Cordless Essential Oil Diffusers

Understanding the mechanisms behind cordless diffusers is crucial to making an informed decision. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the common types:

*   **Ultrasonic Diffusers:** These diffusers use electronic frequencies to create vibrations in water containing essential oils. These vibrations create a fine mist that is then released into the air. While they do require water, they also act as humidifiers, adding moisture to the air. Cordless ultrasonic diffusers have a rechargeable battery that powers the vibrating plate.
*   **Nebulizing Diffusers:** These diffusers use pressurized air to atomize the essential oils into micro-particles without the need for water. This method provides a more concentrated aroma and doesn't dilute the essential oils. Cordless nebulizing diffusers offer the purest form of aromatherapy but may require more frequent refills of essential oils.They can also sometimes be a bit louder.
*   **Evaporative Diffusers:** These diffusers use a fan to blow air across a pad or filter that is saturated with essential oils. This causes the oils to evaporate and disperse into the air. they are typically less expensive, but the scent throw may not be as strong as ultrasonic or nebulizing diffusers.
*  **Heat Diffusers:** These diffusers use heat to vaporize the essential oils.While effective, heat can alter the chemical composition of some oils, perhaps reducing their therapeutic benefits.

## How to Choose the Right Essential Oils for Your Cordless Diffuser

The effectiveness of your **cordless essential oil diffuser** depends not only on the device itself but also on the quality and type of essential oils you use.Here are some tips for choosing the right oils:

*   **Source High-Quality Oils:** Look for 100% pure essential oils from reputable suppliers. Avoid oils that contain synthetic fragrances or additives. Check for GC/MS (Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry) reports to verify the purity and composition of the oils.
*   **Consider Your Needs:** Different essential oils have different properties and benefits. Lavender is known for its calming effects, while peppermint can boost energy and focus. Choose oils that align with your desired outcome.
*   **Blend Your Own Scents:** Experiment with blending different essential oils to create your own unique aromatherapy experiences. A few popular blends include lavender and chamomile for relaxation,eucalyptus and peppermint for respiratory support,and lemon and rosemary for energy and focus.
*   **Be Mindful of Safety:** Some essential oils are not safe for pregnant women, children, or pets. Do your research and consult with a qualified aromatherapist if you have any concerns.
*   **Follow Diffuser Instructions:** Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for using essential oils in your specific diffuser.

## Tips for Maintaining Your Cordless Essential Oil Diffuser

Proper maintenance is essential to ensure the longevity and performance of your **cordless essential oil diffuser**. Here are some helpful tips:

*   **Clean Regularly:** Clean your diffuser after each use or at least once a week to prevent buildup and maintain optimal performance. Use a soft cloth or cotton swab to wipe down the interior and exterior of the unit.
*   **Use Distilled Water:** If your diffuser uses water, use distilled water instead of tap water to prevent mineral buildup.
*   **Avoid Overfilling:** Do not overfill the water reservoir or essential oil chamber. Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.
*   **Store Properly:** When not in use, store your diffuser in a cool, dry place.
*   **Replace Parts as Needed:** Over time, some parts of your diffuser may need to be replaced, such as the ultrasonic disc or the fan.

university is very stressful lately and taking most of my time. i have a few friends but almost never go out because they're all too busy or introverts as well.

i tried dating apps but i either get ghosted or it just never works out. i haven't even been on a date ever and the thought terrifies me.

i know i should probably go and see a therapist but i can't afford it lately. i just feel so incredibly lonely. i try to go outside when i can, to libraries and coffee shops and stuff, but i never have the guts to approach anyone. i suck at flirting too, i just feel like i'm going to be single all my life and my whole life in general feels like a waste

1j753hy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1j753hy/either_i_healed_crohns_or_never_had_it/,Either I healed crohns or never had it,"About nine months ago, I had a brutal bout of vomiting and diarrhea that lasted for eight hours. I honestly thought I‚Äôd have to go to the hospital.

After that, I felt nauseous almost constantly for nine months. I also had acid reflux, and my esophagus was in pain‚Äîsometimes so bad that even talking hurt. I was put on acid blockers and completely cut out acidic foods and drinks like carbonated beverages, coffee, and fatty foods that stimulate stomach acid production.

My symptoms only improved very slowly over the course of months. It felt like the nightmare would never end.

A few weeks ago, life finally started to feel somewhat livable again. Before that, I had basically been unable to work for nine months. Fortunately, since I can work from home and can mostly take it easy, I somehow managed to get through it without losing my job.

I was almost in the clear until I started adding some different food and beverages. Then, after a few days, things got bad again:

Out of nowhere, I felt nauseous again‚Äîwithout smoking, drinking, or eating anything unhealthy that day.

I thought, This can‚Äôt be happening. Will this ever end?

I felt absolutely sick to my stomach and just wanted to throw up to get some relief. I started shaking my body to make my stomach acid slosh around, hoping to force myself to vomit. And then I did.

What I saw was shocking: whole green beans staring back at me. I thought, Huh, they still look freshly picked. That probably means my stomach isn‚Äôt digesting them properly.

That‚Äôs when I learned through ChatGPT, that eating too fast can increase stomach acid production by up to 50%. Saliva helps the stomach by reducing its workload and even killing bacteria.

I used to inhale a kebap in five to ten minutes. At the table, I was always the first one done eating. Apparently, no one ever taught me to eat slowly.

A few days ago, I started consciously eating slower‚Äîchewing more until my food was nothing but saliva-soaked mush. On top of that, I started taking PPIs again, which previously hadn‚Äôt been effective even at high doses over long periods.

Within just a few days, my symptoms started healing at turbo speed. Now, they‚Äôre almost completely gone, and my stomach feels better than ever. I used to get car sick as a passenger all the time‚ÄîI can‚Äôt imagine that happening anymore. And here‚Äôs where it gets even crazier:

I‚Äôve had Crohn‚Äôs disease for about six years‚Äîa chronic inflammation of the intestines. My symptoms were diarrhea, frequent trips to the bathroom, bloating, and occasional constipation.

Back then, a colonoscopy showed that only a tiny part of my terminal ileitis (I believe that was it) was slightly inflamed. I was given corticosteroid granules to swallow, but they didn‚Äôt help. My doctor took my poop and did a blood test, but my inflammation markers weren‚Äôt concerning. Since I could live with my symptoms somewhat normally, we just left it at that.

Then, last year, I suddenly developed an anal fistula‚Äîa complication of Crohn‚Äôs disease. I had to have surgery to remove it.

After that, I looked for a Crohn‚Äôs specialist in my city, since I moved and hadn‚Äôt had one there yet. We did another colonoscopy, and my doctor was shocked. My entire intestine was inflamed and full of erosions.

He asked me how I was even able to work‚Äîapparently, I didn‚Äôt look sick at all. In my head, I just thought, If only he knew... But I didn‚Äôt say anything. Now, the turnaround:

Since I started eating my food slowly, my Crohn‚Äôs symptoms have completely disappeared. My restroom visits are just once daily and my poop is like it's supposed to be: so solid that you don't even have to wipe your butt. Once it even was so massive it slipped into the toilet I didn't even have to flush.

Next week, I have an appointment to start long-term infusion therapy for Crohn‚Äôs, but I‚Äôll probably cancel it if my symptoms don‚Äôt come back.

Even my fatigue, lack of motivation, ADHD and allergy symptoms seem dramatically reduced. Though I might be getting ahead of myself here‚ÄîI‚Äôll have to wait and see. I‚Äôm also doing desensitization therapy for my dust mite allergy and had my last injection last Monday. But I‚Äôve never experienced such a drastic improvement in such a short time.

Right now, I‚Äôm honestly just stunned and losing my mind.

I can‚Äôt help but wonder‚Äîwould my life have turned out differently if I had just eaten more slowly all along?

Me and my roommate (he‚Äôs straight) have lived together for about 2 and a half years, we met before he moved in with me, but we didn‚Äôt know each other very well. Well now, we are extremely close, like we are together ALL THE TIME. We watch TV, work on our computers, play games, go out, grocery shopping, get coffee, etc. all together. We call each other when we get off work, cook for each other, buy each other stuff, give each other rides when someone needs it, the list goes on and on. Our lives are completely intertwined. And I‚Äôve thought about it‚Ä¶ this is the type of stuff that couples do together, right? Like we don‚Äôt do anything romantic or sexual, but I feel like this is beyond just a regular friendship.

I won‚Äôt lie, I love it, I love always having him around me, and I think he enjoys having me around him too, and we never seem to get tired of each other. Honestly, it‚Äôs so fulfilling and comforting to me, that I haven‚Äôt even been dating or hooking up lately. He just makes me so happy, and we don‚Äôt even need to kiss or have sex or anything?!

I might be starting a new job in the near future and it might require me to possibly move to another city, and he‚Äôs expressed that he wants to come with me, which I absolutely approve of!

Perfect shots, no channelling.

However, I have recently got the Impact Tamper and the WDT Cyclone gear from MHW-3Bomber but since having these, I've started to get channeling in my espresso shots, mainly 3 streams coming from the portafilter, some spraying and just messy shots. (I have ground finder too and not much change)

I am wondering if anyone with these two bits of equipment have had similar issues? I've ground finer and no change, any finer the shot goes really slowly. If I switch back to manually using the cheap WDT tool and Tamping with the included LM Tamper, there are no channeling issues whatsoever and the shot is perfect so the grind is ok.

I think the WDT Cyclone is to blame, if I Manually WDT with the cheap WDT Tool and then tamp with impact tamper I get decent shots not great, some slight channeling. If I use both tools by MHW I get dreadful channeling. I might be doing something wrong. I grind the coffee into cup, flip the portfailer and coffee goes in. Then I use the Cyclone tool 2-3 times, tap and cyclone again and tap to flatten, then Tamp and pull the shot but it starts channeling. I've tried reduced spins with the cyclone, I've also tried not tapping the portafilter down to stop flattening the bed of coffee but this made it worse. I just am not sure if I am doing something wrong? If I revert back to how it was, my shots are perfect so my dialling in should be fine, just not sure if these tools are great?

Not really impressed, the tools are fairly expensive and I was getting better shots with a ¬£10 manual WDT tool and the included tamper. Just after some advise if anyone has had similar? Can the impact tamper be adjusted? I can't see online how to adjust. Photo's in comments of two pucks after Tamp",1,1741517078.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

Looking for an advice regarding which espresso machine could suit my needs.


I am an owner of a small restaurant in a Spanish tourist town. We are not open for breakfasts, but there is a culture of having espressos after dinner in the area. We don't consume enough coffee a week for a supplier to come in and provide us with a coffee machine. I am talking volumes of about 5-10 cups a day between lunch and dinner service. 

It breaks my heart to put so much effort in the food and service we provide only to serve lavazza capsule coffee at the end of the meal.

I am looking at prosumer machines that can handle 5-10 espressos and a few cortados a day and decent servicability. Speed is not incredibly important, as we rarely have to make more than two drinks at once. I hope one day we will outgrow this machine and i can retire at home for personal use. 

The budget is pretty tight, between all other improvements we make to the restaurant before the season, I would say it's about 1000 euro give or take 500 euro for machine and a grinder.

The crowd isn't particularly discerning, mostly used to drinking overextracted dark roasts with boiling milk, so we are not aiming for best of the best, it's more about sticking to the principles and doing something right.

Any suggestions would be highly appreciated. If anything seems unreasonable in my criteria, please bring it up. Thanks

1j75115,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1j75115/just_another_guy_suffering_from_awful_insomnia/,Just another guy suffering from awful Insomnia,"I'm having awful insomnia on Vyvanse(30mg Brand). Standard sleep aids like Ambien, Klonopin and Xanax wont help. Sure, they'll put you to sleep, but only if you take like two tablets at once, and even so, I'd wake up in a total state of alertness 3 hours latter. The only decent sleep I'm getting is coming from my drug holidays(Sundays and Saturdays, sometimes Fridays as well).


I tried a variety of supplements, of which, only Magnesium(chelate glycinate) seems to help a bit. Last week I phoned my doctor, and he authorized to me try between 0.100mg and 0.200mg of Clonidine 2h before bedtime. It helps a bit, but not a lot.


Most days I'm out of bed by 4 AM or 5 AM, and I immediately take my dose, just before eating breakfast and even so, 16, 18 and sometimes even 20 hours latter I'm still feeling it, and I hate it. Clonodine helped with this feeling when I take it, it seems to go away however the insomnia is still there. I'm new to Vyvanse(started last November), but not new to stims for ADHD treatment, unfortunately I had to migrate from Concerta/Ritalin after almost 5 years, due to a paradoxical side effect.


Vyvanse works great, but it works for too long. I tried to lower the dosage to 25mg and it had no therapeutical effects, except it kept me awake until 2 AM, and them I'd fall into a deep slumber, and wake up at 6 AM.


This lack of sleep has started taking its toll on me, in the middle of the day I'd have brain fogs, get forgetful, and even fall asleep for a few minutes on my desk several times.


I cut coffee out completely some time ago, coz I believed this could be the source of the bad sleep. I haven't tried melatonin yet, I'll ask my doctor next time I see him.


Something else I was thinking, do I ""ride this out"" and eventually my body will get used to Vyvanse and I won't have trouble with my sleep anymore? I remember my sister having the same issue on Wellbutrin, she persisted, and it went away after a couple of months, but then again, she's younger than me, and had time to spare for naps during the day, I don't, and even if I did, it doesn't feel like sleep, it just feels like when I fall against my desk, like ""time went missing"".


Please, don't suggest me cannabinoids, I had very bad experiences with them before, they are definitely not for me, and I wont force the issue.


Thank you for your time and attention!!

Everything‚Äôs been pretty good until last week when he dropped this bomb. I was getting ready to go out with my girls just to grab coffee nothing fancy. I had on a full face of makeup nothing crazy just foundation eyeliner the usual. He walked in saw me and said ‚ÄúWhy do you even bother with all that? It‚Äôs false advertising.‚Äù

I froze because wtf does that even mean? He doubled down and said I‚Äôm ‚Äúcatfishing‚Äù him by looking different without makeup. Keep in mind he‚Äôs seen me without makeup PLENTY of times. We‚Äôve literally had sex right after I washed my face and he never complained then. In fact he‚Äôs always said I look ‚Äúhot‚Äù natural.

I told him I do my makeup for ME because it makes me feel confident. He rolled his eyes and said ‚ÄúConfident or insecure?‚Äù Like okay Freud. Now he‚Äôs acting like I‚Äôm the problem for wanting to wear mascara. His argument is that guys don‚Äôt care about makeup and I‚Äôm ‚Äúwasting time‚Äù trying to impress people. But I‚Äôm not doing it for guys??? Or even for him??? Honestly I like doing it coz other men gives me more attention than him, but whatever

Here‚Äôs where I might‚Äôve overreacted. I snapped and said ‚ÄúMaybe if you put half the effort into foreplay as I do into my eyeliner I wouldn‚Äôt need distractions.‚Äù He called me petty and stormed out. Now he‚Äôs giving me the silent treatment unless I apologize. I don't really like guys who takes their time to do it. I like it when they're fast and hard if u know what I mean..

But, part of me feels bad for the low blow but the other part is pissed. Since when does liking winged liner make me a catfish? I'm honestly tempted just to move on and find someone else, a lot of guys are hitting me up now ever since  i im getting confident about my look and i just got in shape and it's been a while since i've been single.

I went about Hoan Kiem lake, west lake, walkingstreet, museum of ethnology, vietnamese womans museum, the different pagodas, hoa lo prison. Walked around Yen Hoa and Ho Tay. 

I really liked the busy nature in hanoi and waking up every morning was exciting because it felt to me like there were so many things to see in hanoi. There was this feeling of homeliness in hanoi as well despite it being very busy and everything felt super spacious.

It had plenty of great walking spaces as well but after like 5 days walking around hanoi felt abit boring because i wasen't exactly sure what else to do after visiting most of the tourist attractions and walking about. The people there seemed to be more closed of as well and grumpier especially the bus conductors. Being a muslim, halal food is also harder to find in hanoi and i was told by a friend in HCMC that halal food is everywhere there.

But when i left hanoi i missed the busyness of it, the cold weather, the feeling of spaciousness and space that i felt in hanoi. So now im not sure whether to go back further north in hanoi? I haven't been to other areas in hanoi like ha long bay, ninh binh. And im wondering if these other parts of hanoi could capture the same feelings which i felt while i was in the old quarters, walking around hoan kiem lake, west lake and Yen Hoa.

Or should i now try travelling to HCMC and the provinces around HCM for a week? I come from Singapore where its a metropolitic city and has flat ground everywhere. And if HCMC is just like another Singapore i would be dissapointed.

I'm not interested either in clubs, nightlife more into the coffee culture, vietnamese food, walking about and cultural spots and scenic places. One of the things which captivated me the most about hanoi was its rich history when it came to the different traditions and cultures of vietnam.

This comprehensive guide provides expert advice on resources, methods, and study plans for learners at every proficiency level, from A1 to C1. Whether you‚Äôre just starting out or aiming for advanced fluency, this blog post offers practical tips to guide you every step of the way.

Where Do I Start Learning German (A1 Level)?

For beginners, keeping things simple is essential. Stick to one or two resources to build a strong foundation without feeling overwhelmed. A great starting point is Nico‚Äôs Weg, a free online course by Deutsche Welle, featuring short videos, exercises, and grammar breakdowns tailored for new learners. To make the most of it, try rewriting video scripts and reviewing vocabulary lists‚Äîrepetition helps solidify the basics.

For interactive learning, Lingoda offers private or small group lessons with native-speaking teachers, covering practical topics like ordering coffee or introducing yourself. Its flexible scheduling suits busy lifestyles, and the Sprint Challenge‚Äîa daily lesson for 60 days‚Äîcan fast-track progress to A1.2, often with cashback incentives. Tools like Anki (try the Goethe Deck A1-B1) are perfect for vocabulary, while Reverso helps with conjugation practice. Aim to learn 10-20 words daily and save verbs for later review.

Two-Hour Study Plan for A1:

* 1 hour: Nico‚Äôs Weg or Lingoda lesson
* 30 minutes: Anki vocabulary
* 30 minutes: Reverso conjugation exercises

How Can I Build Confidence at A2 Level?
