This is long but every word is relevant. Grab a coffee.

**The tl;dr**

If you are searching for apartments in Uptown Chicago and this building came up in your search: do not sign a lease at Upshore Residences or Upshore Chapter until this situation resolves. Financial instability, four management companies in three years, documented retaliation, hostile management, a pattern of targeting vulnerable residents, and suppressed reviews are not a foundation for a home.

If you are a current resident at 4555 N Sheridan: we have a tenant union. Find us. Chicago's RLTO is one of the strongest tenant protection laws in the country and you have more rights than Willow Bridge wants you to know about.

We are organized, we are growing daily; this is our home and we're not going anywhere.

**The revolving door of management**

Since August 2023 this building has had FOUR different property management companies. Four. In less than three years. That alone should tell you everything, but let me continue.

The latest, Willow Bridge Property Management, took over on January 7, 2026. Within weeks: trash rooms overflowing, the front door FOB system broken and being phased out entirely, leaving residents with no reliable way to enter their own building. During the coldest week of the year, with wind chills hitting -40 degrees, tenants were locked out at all hours hoping security would eventually let them in. In a neighborhood with multiple mental health and drug rehab facilities on the same block, being stranded outside at 2am in those temperatures is not an inconvenience. It is a safety crisis. Maintenance requests go unanswered. The dog run is smeared with feces and unusable by residents.

**The building is headed toward foreclosure**

The developer, CRG, has been delinquent on a $39 million loan since August 2024. Which explains why our building lost gas service for a week. Neither the owner nor the managers were paying bills. They tried to sell the building in 2023 and couldn't find a buyer. The loan matured in October 2024 and was moved to special servicer Situs Holdings. This is a building where corporate ownership is actively trying to cut costs on a failing investment and residents are paying the price.

**Management is hostile and inaccessible**

Since Willow Bridge arrived, the new on-site manager, Catherine, has made herself largely unavailable to residents, remaining behind a closed office door rather than engaging with legitimate concerns. When residents do manage to get a response, multiple tenants have reported that complaints are met not with solutions but with aggressive and verbally abusive behavior. This is not a management team that views residents as people to be served. Their strategy appears to be harassment and intimidation as a substitute for accountability.

**A pattern of targeting specific residents has developed**

We have observed a concerning pattern in which the residents who appear to be on the receiving end of management's most aggressive behavior are disproportionately Black and LGBTQ+ residents. We are documenting these incidents carefully.

The most recent example: a resident was in the rooftop skylounge, a common amenity available to all tenants, when management sent a security guard up to inform him he was no longer permitted to use the space. No explanation was given. No lease violation was cited. Just a security guard delivering a message that a paying tenant was suddenly unwelcome in his own building's common area. The resident had been having his nails done. Management couldn't be bothered to come up herself or provide any reason whatsoever. Just intimidation, delivered by proxy.

If you are a prospective renter and fair housing and an inclusive environment matter to you, this pattern should be disqualifying.

**They retaliated against organizing tenants**

When residents began organizing and I distributed a letter to all 149 units suggesting collective action, Willow Bridge's response was not to fix the trash or the doors.

First, four days after the letter went out, I was informed that the lease I had signed with the previous management company in December had suddenly ""gone missing"" and that I would need to re-sign a new lease with Willow Bridge or vacate. I have forwarded that matter to my attorney.

Then, rather than address me directly, the building manager had Willow Bridge's lawyer send me an email in response to the organizing letter. Not to tell me to stop. Just vague promises that things would be better at some undetermined future date. This is consistent with how management operates here: the building manager will not engage with residents directly, will not come out of her office, and will not handle conflict herself. She sends lawyers and security guards instead.

Under Chicago's Residential Landlord and Tenant Ordinance (RLTO), forming a tenant union is explicitly protected activity and retaliation within one year creates a legal presumption of unlawful conduct. We have attorneys involved.

**They are suppressing Google reviews**

Residents have been leaving one-star reviews documenting real conditions at this Uptown Chicago apartment building. This week those reviews disappeared. All of them. And here's the kicker: in response, a neighbor who had been watching from the sidelines joined our tenant union specifically because of it. Every petty move they make recruits someone new.

**They changed the building's name to bury the reviews**

The building opened in 2019 as Upshore Chapter. It is now being marketed as Upshore Residences at 4555 N Sheridan Road, Uptown Chicago. If you are searching for reviews of this building, search BOTH names. This appears to be a deliberate attempt to bury negative feedback under a fresh coat of branding.",1,1771439909.0,chicagoapartments,0,1.0,False
1r8b9kp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1r8b9kp/my_mom_turns_into_a_worm_when_she_cries/,My Mom Turns Into A Worm When She Cries,"The State of Massachusetts by Dropkick Murphy blares from every speaker in the Toyota Tacoma, and I avert my eyes from my mom's cheerful amusement. I can see her in the rearview mirror, singing and drumming on the top of the steering wheel, and I turn away to gawk at the blue paint on the outside of the truck and the blurry images of passing woodlands. We have been driving this good ole boy around for almost twenty years now that I know of. It’s me, Nick, my older brother, my mom, Syd, and our dog D. Breeze. D sat in the back seat with me and half of our luggage and all our belongings. D’s  big droopy face hung out the window, his cheeks flung back, and his tongue panting to the side. I reached my hand over the boxes between us and scratched his velvet hide. D was a big dog, and the only reason he fit in this truck was that he was only 6 months old, his entire body already taking up half the back of the seat. 

Syd is an oddly cheery woman and has been since I’ve known her, at least. Even after dad died and we turned into what she calls ‘free spirits, ’ she is still wonderfully positive about everything. Syd can’t keep it together most of the time, and we move around a lot, which we are doing right now. Town to town, city to city, sometimes just county to county. We were just always moving. Everything was always in a rush, too, like the world was on fire. I gotta give her some credit, we make it almost a year in most places. Then something tragic happens, and I watch Syd and Nick run around all frantically getting our apartment, trailer, duplex, all packed up, and then we were out the door as soon as we could grab as much as we could. The only consistent thing that stayed with us so far was Mr. D. He’s only been around for six months. I’m not mad at my mom. I love her more than anything. But how can I really be anything other than worried for her? My mom was a very private woman when Dad was around. She happily hung around the family most days, but then she’d get hit with some kind of mental dilemma, and she would disappear for days at a time inside her room. With dad gone, helping Syd with her mental health and financial support, we had to turn to odd, weird jobs here and there wherever we landed. Then it only took one bad thing to happen for us to sprint away. It was weird too, every time we moved, I never knew the reason, and no one has told me why. Nick knows. Mom told him a long time ago why we move so frequently and never get to know anyone. 

We had driven for days until we hit our first destination. Some washed-up, piece of shit, one-hitter motel.  My mom babbled happily along to the clerk as she pulled out crinkled wads of cash. We were never living in a place long enough to get set up with what my mom calls ‘money scammers, ’ so electronic payment was never an option for us. She kept up the chatter for what felt like forever before trudging us up to the second balcony of the broken-down establishment. I looked down at a corner room where I saw a lovely woman, in a skimpy dress, stiletto heels, take a big wad of cash, all bundled up tightly, from some happy looking mother fucker half dressed. The exchange was over, and the man disappeared, and I watched the young woman take off her heels and then wait for her ride. I didn’t get to see who picked her up before we got to our two queen room. Once we put down everything we had already carried up, we went back down for a second, third, and fourth load. If it wasn’t locked in the room with us, it was locked inside the truck. When everything was settled for the night, I watched Nick disappear into the bathroom, and Syd sat cross-legged on the bed closest to the door flipping through the provided channels. 

The next morning, first thing: getting money. Syd took Nick and me downstairs to the manager’s little hidey hole that could only hold a desk and a chair. Nick and I waited outside the office for an hour while Syd spoke and spoke, on and on, to the manager. Our new employer, Kim, was showing all of us to the work center, which was a closet next to her office. I looked at all the cleaning supplies and knew my mom had sold me for cheap labor. Nick and I always got caught in my mom's scams. Crazy enough, believe it or not, the first room we went to clean was that corner room that I happened to watch just the other day. I shuddered as I picked up stained sheets and watched as discolored lace panties fell out of the bundle and onto the floor. I looked down at the undergarment and felt more relief than disgust. I just knew it didn't matter how low we got in life, Syd never resorted to things like that. I have watched her sell a piece of furniture she refinished from the dump to some chump for hundreds of dollars. She got away with this with her ‘authentic letter’ provided with the rare ‘antique’. Syd was clever like that and quick on her feet. 

When Syd wasn't making us money, however, she kept herself locked in the bathroom. If we had to use it, we had to find another one that wasn't already in use. She used to do it when Dad was alive, and the habit still clung to her now. Just disappearing sometimes for days at a time into one secluded location. Always alone. At first, I was ignorant of why she was in there, but then I began to hear the crying and knew that my mother was finally taking down the charade and taking in her reality as it was. Removing the weight and letting it fall to the floor with a huge thud. I let her be. I never asked about it further. I just assumed Syd was kind of depressed. I felt bad for her, but more than anything, I was concerned for her. She never let me in. I would sometimes see Nick enter the bathroom. I could hear him talking to her, but I could never hear the replies. When he would leave, he would inch out of a crack in the door and always run into me. I would stare up at him, always waiting for an answer, and always, he pushed past me with nothing to give. We cleaned at that motel for a few days, and I began to pick up on the locals' routine around here. 

There was a brief guy, the old man who came out of 1C with his cup of coffee and his whitey tighties. A little newspaper kid comes around here in his beat-up rusted Corolla and gives the old man a rounded-up paper, and the balding man takes it, taps it against his white-haired chest in salute, and walks back into his room every morning at six a.m. Then, there was the woman I named Linda. She is a frequent visitor to 9G, the corner room downstairs. Always the same skimpy dress and stilts, walking in with a different guy each time. She always came around at 9 or 10 in the morning. Watching her, I got the sense we all had our repetitive motions: her ritual visits, my family’s endless moves, looping circles like tapes stuck on the same song. Then there was Carl. That was actually his name. He starts at the office at 5 in the morning with his little hand weights and his sweat suit, and he speed walks the entire motel all morning, chatting up everyone he runs into. When you talk to him, he is always jogging in place, and you can always watch the small lift and fall of his blonde toupee as his steps go up and down in rapid moments. I don't know what the exercise was doing for him; I never saw his beer belly lift even an inch since I saw him. Sometimes I wonder if Carl is running from something too, circling the building over and over but never quite escaping. I watched the waistband grow, however, and I think the poor man just needs to work on his diet.

Nick took the truck every day to a few jobs he could catch in the nearest town, which was miles away. One day, he came back from some kind of weird job that paid him 500 dollars. He told Syd and me that all they did was inject him with a little bit of ‘something’, and he got the money and left. That was a bigger scam than even my mom could pull off. Having live lab rats come to you, baiting them with the finest cheese available to the low living things. Syd happily took the money and added it to our coffee tin.

Day 1: We were all happy until we weren’t. That night, Nick clutched his stomach at dinner, face chalk-white and breaking out in a thin, cold sweat. I watched him pick at his food, hands trembling, pushing the fork around like it was too heavy to lift.

Day 2: By morning, the pain had sharpened. He doubled over after trying to stand, and when he made it to the bathroom, we heard the retching through the thin motel walls. I caught a glimpse of him hunched on the tile, knuckles white against the porcelain rim, and the air was hot with the smell of bile.

Day 3: His skin turned a sallow shade, veins standing out blue against his arms. He lay sprawled in bed, shuddering with fever. I pressed my hand to his forehead and yanked it back—it felt like it could scorch my palm. He barely managed a few words.

Syd drove him to the nearest clinic with every dollar we had, trying to get him some medical help. They only came back with a still very sick Nick and a bottle of antibiotics. 

Day 4: Nick was basically in a comatose state, his only movements including multiple trips to the bathroom and leaning over the edge to barely miss the trash can. His breath rattled in his chest, and his lips were pale and cracked. By that night, his eyes wouldn't fully open, and all I could do was wipe sweat off his brow and hope he could feel me there.

Syd kept him hospitalized in our room the best she could and made him as comfortable as she could, and she did all of this stoically. Her face didn’t distort with sorrow or worry, and her lips did not tremble with even fear. She was calm, put together, and well-managed. I watched her for a couple of days, going through this robotic routine that involved the bathroom as much as she could with Nick being sick. Then one day, while she was trapped in her little prison, sobbing harder than I have ever heard. Nick grabbed my arm, and he pulled me down to his head. He looked me in the eyes with so much consequential dread. 

“You have to go comfort her.” His tone was weak but serious. 

“You want me to do it?” I was more perplexed than ever. I had never seen my mom upset over anything in my entire life. Now he was asking me to step into what seemed to be a more tragic breakdown than all the rest. 

“You have to love her as much as you can, and you have to care for her, show her your concern and sympathy. Let her know she isn't alone.” Nick instructed all of this with an insistent tone. 

“Of course I will do that.” How silly was it that he really had to ask me to do that for our mother? 

“Love her. Just please love her.” He was begging me at this point with tears brimming in his eyes. 

I didn't understand what was so serious about consoling my mother. I knew she was depressed, and I wanted to be there to help. Finally, I was able to be with my mom, sharing a tender moment of grief and releasing the flood of tension. Nick squeezed my arm tight before he let me go.

As I walked toward the bathroom, the sharp hum of the old ceiling light filled the narrow hallway, washing everything in a dull yellow glare. The air was thick and still. I paused outside her door, letting the silence settle around me for a second, giving myself a breath. The muffled sound of Syd’s crying was almost lost in that hush. I softly knocked. All I got in reply were heavier sobs.

I pressed my knuckles against the bathroom door, feeling its cold metal chill seep into my skin. My hand was unsteady, trembling ever so slightly as I let the moment weigh on me. “Mom, I'm gonna come in.” I wanted to introduce myself and not just barge in there.

With so much care, I began to open the door, but something was behind it, making only a crack visible for entry. I took a deep breath, squeezed my body through the crack, and witnessed the clog that had prevented me from a full entry. I don't know what it was, but it couldn't have been Syd. Sprawled across the tiles was an enormous, pale worm, thicker than any snake, its body twitching with unsettled tension. Its flesh had a raw, bruised look, dimpled with small, puckered holes that seemed to breathe, pulling the air in and shuddering it out in short, desperate gasps. For a moment I was transfixed, feeling a hot pulse of pity beneath the revulsion. It looked exhausted, exposed, curling in on itself like it desperately wanted to be hidden. Then the smell crashed into me—the sour, close heat of boiled cabbage and something sharp and chemical, stinging my eyes and scraping the back of my throat. I had to shove out the door and vomit, doubled over with my hands on my knees, shaking. As I tried to gather myself through dry heaves, I heard my brother yell at me.

“Go love her.” He was desperate. 

I wiped my eyes and held my breath, hoping that the small barrier would be enough to keep me from inhaling the stench of boiled cabbage and cat urine. I crept back into the room and took a full look at the slithering thing on the ground in front of me. It was large, that was for sure, and so thick I could sit on it comfortably if I wanted to. But with the small fleshy pores all tiny and placed over every inch of the slimy peach exterior, boiling and oozing out a secretion that was both liquid and solid. The substance that leaked from the orifices of this monster was grey, and it bubbled and emitted a faint hissing sound. For a split second, it was like I saw my mother and not the creature—her grief so big and warped, it almost took on its own form. I watched as the front of the monster, I assumed to be the front, rose up, almost meeting the ceiling. I had to love her. I walked forward and wasn't even close to wrapping both arms around her body. The thick slime oozed onto me as I heaved deep breaths in and out of my nose, trying to remain calm. Then I felt a hand touch my back, and I seized up. I whipped away from the beast and watched as a human arm quickly got sucked back into the fleshy, gooey glob. The wail was like no other, and it vibrated the room. Her loose skin trembled against her shiny body, and her pores let out deep breaths.

I needed to love her. I put my arms around her again and held as tightly as I could, and I felt the worm squirm and wrap around me. It’s thick saliva that ruptured from the little holes covering its body, stuck to me, and almost suctioned to my flesh. The effluvium coming from this thing I was pressed into was worse than ever before, and I had to swallow back vomit as it threatened to leave my throat. I squeezed my eyes closed as what was supposed to be my mother engulfed me in her loose, wet skin. I felt like I was sinking into a mattress, but I kept getting sucked in more and more. I had to turn my head to the side in order to breathe as I fought against the capture of my mom. She sucked me in so close I couldn't move an inch of my body. I felt her squeeze on and off with the sucking of an everlasting tune in these moments of misery. Her head leaned on top of mine and fell down to the back of my neck, where I could hear a gurgling noise. While trying to breathe, I tuned in to a song being softly sung to soothe myself. Dropkick Murphys, of all things, to sing at a time like this. But whatever works for now. I stood like that with her for hours and then felt her slither off my body and curl up into itself. I took that as a plea to leave, so I carefully walked out of the bathroom. 

I went, and I sat down next to my brother, whose raspy breathing was only getting worse. The room finally fell quiet. I didn't know what to say or what to ask. I was covered in grey, stinking ooze, and my hair was thick from the snotty slime. I didn't notice I was shaking until my brother put his hand on top of mine. He pulled me down, and I lay down beside him. He held me even when I was putrid and revolting; he didn't care.

“We have to take care of her.” Nick let out a deep wheeze. He then cleared his throat of all the gunk that was gathering in his membrane. “Sometimes it gets too hard for her in some places, and sometimes we go because she just said so.” He cleared his throat again, trying to get some normalcy back into his tone. “We just have to love her. That’s all she needs, and she will be fine. Just don’t stop loving her.” 

I closed my eyes, lying down next to my brother, and I couldn't help but think about what was going to happen to Syd once the two of us were old enough to go on with our lives. She was going to get old, and she couldn't keep jumping from one place to another until she inevitably died. I vowed to myself that night that I would love my mother, and I would do it through her life. I took on the responsibility of keeping back the beast, and it hung heavier on me than a weight. I knew what I was getting into, but I didn't want my brother to have to do it. I think he's done enough. I'm scared to see my mom cry again. The way her pores siphon like a tube latched to my skin, trying to pull out the love from me physically. I woke up to pressure on my side of the bed and turned my head to see Syd, clean, put together, and happy. 

“I love you, Mom,” I said it out loud so she could really know she was loved. 

“It’s the only thing that keeps me sane.” She laughed, but there were remnants of tears on her cheeks. “I don't know what would happen if I ran out of love.” She whispered more to herself than to me. 

I wouldn't let that happen. I was always going to be there to love her and bring her back. I was going to stick around and make sure she stayed human. I would hate to see her just stay a worm forever. ",1,1771439804.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

I’ve explored a lot of the cafés around here to get outside of my house, but I’m getting bored of going to the same places all the time. Does anyone have some good recommendations for places to work? I’m talking cafés, casual coffee shops/bakeries, etc. I love libraries, but they’re a bit too quiet for my taste. I need some white noise to realky lock in.

I’m looking for places with reliable outlets, as my computer battery dies pretty quickly. I don’t need reliable Wi-Fi as I usually connect to my hotspot due to my job restrictions. So any places with decent food/drinks, good vibes, and somewhat reasonable parking nearby are welcome. Preferably nothing too deep into the valley and nothing south of downtown LA, simply because it’d be a bit too far for me to go during the workday. Somewhere I can get to in less than 30 minutes is ideal. I love Pasadena and Highland Park if anyone knows those areas well. ",1,1771439777.0,AskLosAngeles,0,1.0,False

Day 2: By morning, the pain had sharpened. He doubled over after trying to stand, and when he made it to the bathroom, we heard the retching through the thin motel walls. I caught a glimpse of him hunched on the tile, knuckles white against the porcelain rim, and the air was hot with the smell of bile.

Day 3: His skin turned a sallow shade, veins standing out blue against his arms. He lay sprawled in bed, shuddering with fever. I pressed my hand to his forehead and yanked it back—it felt like it could scorch my palm. He barely managed a few words.

Syd drove him to the nearest clinic with every dollar we had, trying to get him some medical help. They only came back with a still very sick Nick and a bottle of antibiotics. 

Day 4: Nick was basically in a comatose state, his only movements including multiple trips to the bathroom and leaning over the edge to barely miss the trash can. His breath rattled in his chest, and his lips were pale and cracked. By that night, his eyes wouldn't fully open, and all I could do was wipe sweat off his brow and hope he could feel me there.

Syd kept him hospitalized in our room the best she could and made him as comfortable as she could, and she did all of this stoically. Her face didn’t distort with sorrow or worry, and her lips did not tremble with even fear. She was calm, put together, and well-managed. I watched her for a couple of days, going through this robotic routine that involved the bathroom as much as she could with Nick being sick. Then one day, while she was trapped in her little prison, sobbing harder than I have ever heard. Nick grabbed my arm, and he pulled me down to his head. He looked me in the eyes with so much consequential dread. 

“You have to go comfort her.” His tone was weak but serious. 

“You want me to do it?” I was more perplexed than ever. I had never seen my mom upset over anything in my entire life. Now he was asking me to step into what seemed to be a more tragic breakdown than all the rest. 

“You have to love her as much as you can, and you have to care for her, show her your concern and sympathy. Let her know she isn't alone.” Nick instructed all of this with an insistent tone. 

“Of course I will do that.” How silly was it that he really had to ask me to do that for our mother? 

“Love her. Just please love her.” He was begging me at this point with tears brimming in his eyes. 

I didn't understand what was so serious about consoling my mother. I knew she was depressed, and I wanted to be there to help. Finally, I was able to be with my mom, sharing a tender moment of grief and releasing the flood of tension. Nick squeezed my arm tight before he let me go.

As I walked toward the bathroom, the sharp hum of the old ceiling light filled the narrow hallway, washing everything in a dull yellow glare. The air was thick and still. I paused outside her door, letting the silence settle around me for a second, giving myself a breath. The muffled sound of Syd’s crying was almost lost in that hush. I softly knocked. All I got in reply were heavier sobs.

I pressed my knuckles against the bathroom door, feeling its cold metal chill seep into my skin. My hand was unsteady, trembling ever so slightly as I let the moment weigh on me. “Mom, I'm gonna come in.” I wanted to introduce myself and not just barge in there.

With so much care, I began to open the door, but something was behind it, making only a crack visible for entry. I took a deep breath, squeezed my body through the crack, and witnessed the clog that had prevented me from a full entry. I don't know what it was, but it couldn't have been Syd. Sprawled across the tiles was an enormous, pale worm, thicker than any snake, its body twitching with unsettled tension. Its flesh had a raw, bruised look, dimpled with small, puckered holes that seemed to breathe, pulling the air in and shuddering it out in short, desperate gasps. For a moment I was transfixed, feeling a hot pulse of pity beneath the revulsion. It looked exhausted, exposed, curling in on itself like it desperately wanted to be hidden. Then the smell crashed into me—the sour, close heat of boiled cabbage and something sharp and chemical, stinging my eyes and scraping the back of my throat. I had to shove out the door and vomit, doubled over with my hands on my knees, shaking. As I tried to gather myself through dry heaves, I heard my brother yell at me.

“Go love her.” He was desperate. 

I wiped my eyes and held my breath, hoping that the small barrier would be enough to keep me from inhaling the stench of boiled cabbage and cat urine. I crept back into the room and took a full look at the slithering thing on the ground in front of me. It was large, that was for sure, and so thick I could sit on it comfortably if I wanted to. But with the small fleshy pores all tiny and placed over every inch of the slimy peach exterior, boiling and oozing out a secretion that was both liquid and solid. The substance that leaked from the orifices of this monster was grey, and it bubbled and emitted a faint hissing sound. For a split second, it was like I saw my mother and not the creature—her grief so big and warped, it almost took on its own form. I watched as the front of the monster, I assumed to be the front, rose up, almost meeting the ceiling. I had to love her. I walked forward and wasn't even close to wrapping both arms around her body. The thick slime oozed onto me as I heaved deep breaths in and out of my nose, trying to remain calm. Then I felt a hand touch my back, and I seized up. I whipped away from the beast and watched as a human arm quickly got sucked back into the fleshy, gooey glob. The wail was like no other, and it vibrated the room. Her loose skin trembled against her shiny body, and her pores let out deep breaths.

I needed to love her. I put my arms around her again and held as tightly as I could, and I felt the worm squirm and wrap around me. It’s thick saliva that ruptured from the little holes covering its body, stuck to me, and almost suctioned to my flesh. The effluvium coming from this thing I was pressed into was worse than ever before, and I had to swallow back vomit as it threatened to leave my throat. I squeezed my eyes closed as what was supposed to be my mother engulfed me in her loose, wet skin. I felt like I was sinking into a mattress, but I kept getting sucked in more and more. I had to turn my head to the side in order to breathe as I fought against the capture of my mom. She sucked me in so close I couldn't move an inch of my body. I felt her squeeze on and off with the sucking of an everlasting tune in these moments of misery. Her head leaned on top of mine and fell down to the back of my neck, where I could hear a gurgling noise. While trying to breathe, I tuned in to a song being softly sung to soothe myself. Dropkick Murphys, of all things, to sing at a time like this. But whatever works for now. I stood like that with her for hours and then felt her slither off my body and curl up into itself. I took that as a plea to leave, so I carefully walked out of the bathroom. 

I went, and I sat down next to my brother, whose raspy breathing was only getting worse. The room finally fell quiet. I didn't know what to say or what to ask. I was covered in grey, stinking ooze, and my hair was thick from the snotty slime. I didn't notice I was shaking until my brother put his hand on top of mine. He pulled me down, and I lay down beside him. He held me even when I was putrid and revolting; he didn't care.

“We have to take care of her.” Nick let out a deep wheeze. He then cleared his throat of all the gunk that was gathering in his membrane. “Sometimes it gets too hard for her in some places, and sometimes we go because she just said so.” He cleared his throat again, trying to get some normalcy back into his tone. “We just have to love her. That’s all she needs, and she will be fine. Just don’t stop loving her.” 

I closed my eyes, lying down next to my brother, and I couldn't help but think about what was going to happen to Syd once the two of us were old enough to go on with our lives. She was going to get old, and she couldn't keep jumping from one place to another until she inevitably died. I vowed to myself that night that I would love my mother, and I would do it through her life. I took on the responsibility of keeping back the beast, and it hung heavier on me than a weight. I knew what I was getting into, but I didn't want my brother to have to do it. I think he's done enough. I'm scared to see my mom cry again. The way her pores siphon like a tube latched to my skin, trying to pull out the love from me physically. I woke up to pressure on my side of the bed and turned my head to see Syd, clean, put together, and happy. 

“I love you, Mom,” I said it out loud so she could really know she was loved. 

“It’s the only thing that keeps me sane.” She laughed, but there were remnants of tears on her cheeks. “I don't know what would happen if I ran out of love.” She whispered more to herself than to me. 

I wouldn't let that happen. I was always going to be there to love her and bring her back. I was going to stick around and make sure she stayed human. I would hate to see her just stay a worm forever. ",1,1771439774.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I can see her in the rearview mirror, singing and drumming on the top of the steering wheel, and I turn away to gawk at the blue paint on the outside of the truck and the blurry images of passing woodlands. We have been driving this good ole boy around for almost twenty years now that I know of. It’s me, Nick, my older brother, my mom, Syd, and our dog D. Breeze. D sat in the back seat with me and half of our luggage and all our belongings. D’s  big droopy face hung out the window, his cheeks flung back, and his tongue panting to the side. I reached my hand over the boxes between us and scratched his velvet hide. D was a big dog, and the only reason he fit in this truck was that he was only 6 months old, his entire body already taking up half the back of the seat. 

Syd is an oddly cheery woman and has been since I’ve known her, at least. Even after dad died and we turned into what she calls ‘free spirits, ’ she is still wonderfully positive about everything. Syd can’t keep it together most of the time, and we move around a lot, which we are doing right now. Town to town, city to city, sometimes just county to county. We were just always moving. Everything was always in a rush, too, like the world was on fire. I gotta give her some credit, we make it almost a year in most places. Then something tragic happens, and I watch Syd and Nick run around all frantically getting our apartment, trailer, duplex, all packed up, and then we were out the door as soon as we could grab as much as we could. The only consistent thing that stayed with us so far was Mr. D. He’s only been around for six months. I’m not mad at my mom. I love her more than anything. But how can I really be anything other than worried for her? My mom was a very private woman when Dad was around. She happily hung around the family most days, but then she’d get hit with some kind of mental dilemma, and she would disappear for days at a time inside her room. With dad gone, helping Syd with her mental health and financial support, we had to turn to odd, weird jobs here and there wherever we landed. Then it only took one bad thing to happen for us to sprint away. It was weird too, every time we moved, I never knew the reason, and no one has told me why. Nick knows. Mom told him a long time ago why we move so frequently and never get to know anyone. 

We had driven for days until we hit our first destination. Some washed-up, piece of shit, one-hitter motel.  My mom babbled happily along to the clerk as she pulled out crinkled wads of cash. We were never living in a place long enough to get set up with what my mom calls ‘money scammers, ’ so electronic payment was never an option for us. She kept up the chatter for what felt like forever before trudging us up to the second balcony of the broken-down establishment. I looked down at a corner room where I saw a lovely woman, in a skimpy dress, stiletto heels, take a big wad of cash, all bundled up tightly, from some happy looking mother fucker half dressed. The exchange was over, and the man disappeared, and I watched the young woman take off her heels and then wait for her ride. I didn’t get to see who picked her up before we got to our two queen room. Once we put down everything we had already carried up, we went back down for a second, third, and fourth load. If it wasn’t locked in the room with us, it was locked inside the truck. When everything was settled for the night, I watched Nick disappear into the bathroom, and Syd sat cross-legged on the bed closest to the door flipping through the provided channels. 

The next morning, first thing: getting money. Syd took Nick and me downstairs to the manager’s little hidey hole that could only hold a desk and a chair. Nick and I waited outside the office for an hour while Syd spoke and spoke, on and on, to the manager. Our new employer, Kim, was showing all of us to the work center, which was a closet next to her office. I looked at all the cleaning supplies and knew my mom had sold me for cheap labor. Nick and I always got caught in my mom's scams. Crazy enough, believe it or not, the first room we went to clean was that corner room that I happened to watch just the other day. I shuddered as I picked up stained sheets and watched as discolored lace panties fell out of the bundle and onto the floor. I looked down at the undergarment and felt more relief than disgust. I just knew it didn't matter how low we got in life, Syd never resorted to things like that. I have watched her sell a piece of furniture she refinished from the dump to some chump for hundreds of dollars. She got away with this with her ‘authentic letter’ provided with the rare ‘antique’. Syd was clever like that and quick on her feet. 

When Syd wasn't making us money, however, she kept herself locked in the bathroom. If we had to use it, we had to find another one that wasn't already in use. She used to do it when Dad was alive, and the habit still clung to her now. Just disappearing sometimes for days at a time into one secluded location. Always alone. At first, I was ignorant of why she was in there, but then I began to hear the crying and knew that my mother was finally taking down the charade and taking in her reality as it was. Removing the weight and letting it fall to the floor with a huge thud. I let her be. I never asked about it further. I just assumed Syd was kind of depressed. I felt bad for her, but more than anything, I was concerned for her. She never let me in. I would sometimes see Nick enter the bathroom. I could hear him talking to her, but I could never hear the replies. When he would leave, he would inch out of a crack in the door and always run into me. I would stare up at him, always waiting for an answer, and always, he pushed past me with nothing to give. We cleaned at that motel for a few days, and I began to pick up on the locals' routine around here. 

There was a brief guy, the old man who came out of 1C with his cup of coffee and his whitey tighties. A little newspaper kid comes around here in his beat-up rusted Corolla and gives the old man a rounded-up paper, and the balding man takes it, taps it against his white-haired chest in salute, and walks back into his room every morning at six a.m. Then, there was the woman I named Linda. She is a frequent visitor to 9G, the corner room downstairs. Always the same skimpy dress and stilts, walking in with a different guy each time. She always came around at 9 or 10 in the morning. Watching her, I got the sense we all had our repetitive motions: her ritual visits, my family’s endless moves, looping circles like tapes stuck on the same song. Then there was Carl. That was actually his name. He starts at the office at 5 in the morning with his little hand weights and his sweat suit, and he speed walks the entire motel all morning, chatting up everyone he runs into. When you talk to him, he is always jogging in place, and you can always watch the small lift and fall of his blonde toupee as his steps go up and down in rapid moments. I don't know what the exercise was doing for him; I never saw his beer belly lift even an inch since I saw him. Sometimes I wonder if Carl is running from something too, circling the building over and over but never quite escaping. I watched the waistband grow, however, and I think the poor man just needs to work on his diet.

Nick took the truck every day to a few jobs he could catch in the nearest town, which was miles away. One day, he came back from some kind of weird job that paid him 500 dollars. He told Syd and me that all they did was inject him with a little bit of ‘something’, and he got the money and left. That was a bigger scam than even my mom could pull off. Having live lab rats come to you, baiting them with the finest cheese available to the low living things. Syd happily took the money and added it to our coffee tin.

Day 1: We were all happy until we weren’t. That night, Nick clutched his stomach at dinner, face chalk-white and breaking out in a thin, cold sweat. I watched him pick at his food, hands trembling, pushing the fork around like it was too heavy to lift.

I caught a glimpse of him hunched on the tile, knuckles white against the porcelain rim, and the air was hot with the smell of bile.

Saksi sa lahat ng sakit na pinagdaanan ko at lahat ng panloloko nya ang bestfriend ko. Galit na galit din sya sa ex ko kasi ginago ako ng ganon ganon lang at lalo na dun sa babae kasi nakita nya kung paano ako nasaktan ng sobra.

After almost 3 yrs, finally nakamove on na din ako. Sobrang OA pero ganon katagal ako bago nakamove on. Tapos out of nowhere chinat ako ng bestfriend ko na chinat daw sya ng ex ko, saying na namimiss na daw ako at balak akong parang ligawan ulit. Pero sabi ko non hindi na, lalo na at sobrang sakit ng ginawa nya pero ang sabi nya sa bestfriend ko hihintayin nya ako ulit. 

Ilang months ang lumipas, naging busy na ako sa life kaya parang almost a month din kami hindi nagkausap ng bestfriend ko. Kasi ganon naman talaga yung ibang mag bff diba. Madalas ako inaaya ng bestfriend ko mag coffee date, kaso hindi matuloy tuloy kasi nga super busy ko. 

Tapos bigla na lang after namin magusap non about sa coffee date sana namin na di matuloy tuloy nakatulog na ako sa pagod. Tapos ewan ko sobrang random, napanaginipan ko yung bestfriend ko na may kasamang lalaki na pakiramdam ko familiar, naweirduhan ako kasi  nbsb yon. Pero nung nagising ako ewan ko parang ang bilis ng tibok ng puso ko, pero pinagsawalang bahala ko na lang kahit pakiramdam ko may mali.

Then one day, nagopen ako ng social media and then boom. Para akong nabuhusan ng malamig na tubig tapos biglang nagloading utak ko. Nakita kong yung bestfriend ko at yung ex ko ay magkasama at magjowa na pala sila hahahaha. Wala akong kaalam alam. Hindi ko na kinausap ang bestfriend ko. Wala din akong narinig na kahit anong paliwanag mula sa kanya. Nakakatawa kasi parehas pa kami ng first boyfriend luh hahahaha.

Months after chinat ako ng isang relative ng ex ko at sinabing ikakasal na daw yung ex ko dahil buntis na yung gf. Sinabi ko sa relative ng ex ko na bestfriend ko yung pakakasalan, gulat na gulat sya at hindi makapaniwala at sinabing paano daw nagawa yun ng ex ko at ng bestfriend ko sa akin, sana ako na lang daw nakatuluyan. Hindi na ako nagreply.

Lumipas ulit ang ilang buwan, nakita kong ikinasal na pala sila. Ganoon pa din, kahit anong balita ay wala ni katiting akong narinig sa bestfriend ko. Paliwanag o sorry, wala. As in wala, na para bang hindi kami magkakilala. Masakit sakin yon syempre kasi noon usapan namin gagawin naming abay sa kasal ang isa't isa. Saksi sya sa lahat ng yugto ng buhay ko, alam nya lahat ng sakit na pinagdaanan ko sa ex boyfriend ko at kung gaano ako nahirapan makausad.

Hanggang ngayon ay hindi pa din kami naguusap ng bestfriend ko. Hindi ko din alam kung valid ba yung naramdaman kong sakit at tampo noong naging sila, at ngayon asawa na nya. Although wala naman na akong pakialam na sa ex ko, pero sa bestfriend ko ako nanghinayang. ",0,1771439737.0,ShareKoLang,0,0.5,False

I know it takes a while but I’m feeling disheartened and it’s probably because of the insomnia. I slept badly before starting dex and I take a bunch of doctor approved stuff that helped me enormously - I was sleeping the best I have in 20+ years. 

I have my 6 week review in about a month but the psychiatrist said if I have any issues I can call for a 15 minute zoom to talk about it.

  
Should I persevere for longer? Will things improve after the 2 week mark? I don’t want to give up too soon but all I’m experiencing is negative after negative and not seeing any positives. 

  
I genuinely don’t know what is normal in terms of timeframe after starting meds. ",1,1771439639.0,ausadhd,0,1.0,False

I’d go out on dates, party, drink, and do whatever I wanted - whenever I wanted. Dating is awful these days. I got fed up with social media multiple times and would deactivate socials one by one. Eventually I’d reactivate them and be back to the ‘normal’ if there is such a thing.

Fast forward to April 2024, I went on a date with a guy who I felt was too good to be true. (Met on fb dating so my mind was ready to see where things go sour.) we had a great time. I truly enjoyed his company. We wound up going on a second date the next day for coffee. Everything just felt so good and natural.

My gosh, his eyes, smile, and sense of humor. 

Spoiler; we’ve been dating for almost 2 years now. Our relationship has had more ups than downs, he’s taught me how to better communicate, how to love gently, and so much more. He’s given me the opportunity in life to be a mother to his babies, help them learn and grow, and even have coffee or donut dates with. 

I feel I’m becoming the best version of me, because of him. I feel like his creativeness has intertwined with mine, and helps me grow. I’ve taken over his house with my things and shoved him into a corner with the spiders. But with everything, he’s loved me through it all. 

I thought I was living it up partying, drinking, and just being free. I feel I’m my happiest now because I get to wake up and fall asleep next to him, make breakfast and dinner, help with the babies that sometimes drive me insane, and most of all, he loves me for my goofy self.

1r8b4fd,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1r8b4fd/parking_tips_for_lunar_new_year_year_of_the_horse/,Parking tips for Lunar New Year - Year of the Horse at Santa Anita Park (Arcadia 02/22),"  
  
yo, figured i'd share some info on parking for the lunar new year festival at santa anita park on 02/22. it is going to be the year of the horse so you know the place is gonna be packed with people and traffic will be a mess on huntington drive and baldwin ave.  
  
honestly before you deal with the massive lines at the gates you should check out Prked. it is an app where you can rent driveways or garages from people who live right next to santa anita park. it is way cheaper than the official venue parking and it lets you skip the nightmare of exiting those huge lots after the event ends. plus a short walk is way better than sitting in your car for forty minutes trying to get out of the dirt lot.  
  
if you decide to go with the official lot just know that the main entrances are off huntington dr at gate 3 or off baldwin ave at gate 8. they usually charge around twenty or thirty bucks for the closer spots and maybe less for general but the lines get backed up all the way to the 210 freeway. try to get there at least an hour before the 10:30 am start time because baldwin ave basically turns into a parking lot itself. gate 5 on colorado blvd is sometimes open too and can be a sneaky way in if the others are jammed.  
  
some people try to park at the westfield santa anita mall across the street to save money but i would be careful with that. security is usually on top of it during big festivals like this and they might tow if they see you walking across the street to the track instead of going into the mall. if you do use the mall maybe grab a coffee or something first so you look like a customer but it is still risky.  
  
residential streets nearby are also tricky because many of them have permit only signs especially on the south side of huntington dr and the streets near holly ave. if you do not have a permit you will definitely get a ticket from arcadia pd. another move is taking the metro l line to the arcadia station and then grabbing the shuttle or a quick uber but even those get stuck in the traffic on the way in.  
  
the traffic flow usually gets really heavy right around noon so if you are not parked by then you are going to be waiting a long time in your car. baldwin and colorado blvd are usually the worst spots for congestion. just plan ahead so you do not miss the lion dances and the food stalls. hope this helps you out.",1,1771439494.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False
1r8b41i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r8b41i,Pojagi curtains for a home office,"Hi sewing friends! My partner and I bought our own (small) home this year and we both work from home. His office is in a little nook (originally a breakfast nook) off our kitchen, so he needed some visual separation from me when I’m cooking/making coffee and he’s in the zone. 



I settled on wanting Japanese Noren curtains (two flat rectangle panels, and not all the way to the floor) to let light in and let our dog walk under the curtain :) After exploring ideas on Etsy and Youtube for a while, I wanted to try my hand at the Korean Pojagi technique—a reversible patchwork quilting technique that reminds me so much of stained glass. 



For details about how to do Pojagi, I used these two videos:

[https://youtu.be/UgXY8Fb7HTs](https://youtu.be/UgXY8Fb7HTs)

[https://youtu.be/X5ViW5mraYM](https://youtu.be/X5ViW5mraYM)



This was such a cool & beautiful technique that let me be super creative! There’s no pattern to it, though I supposed you could use one—you just starting sewing pieces of fabric together, then sewing larger chunks together, then repeat til you have the size you want and then you finish the edges. It took a lot of trial and error when laying out the big chunks to decide how exactly I wanted them laid out in the curtain. Pojagi essentially uses flat felled seams to connect the fabric pieces, then I used a folded hem to finish the edges. I also sewed a curtain rod pocket at the top to hang them from a rod. 



The colored linen squares were already in my stash—I had ordered linen color samples for a project years ago and hung on to all of them in case I ever had a use for 2x2” squares of linen, lol. I picked up 3 yards of white linen for the rest and used about 2.5 yards.

But I've found a couple things that helped? I think?

I noticed that hotels don’t really care how you hit the minimum, just that you do. Once I stopped treating it like “we must eat this much food,” things got easier. Coffee breaks, welcome drinks, late night snacks, grab and go, etc. If people are consuming it, make it count, right?

I also chilled out on formal meals. One memorable food moment is way better than three expensive courses no one remembers. Timing helps too, obviously. Brunch and receptions are way more forgiving than full dinners.

I always ask for flexibility early. Like, before contracts are locked. That’s when you’ll actually get yeses.

But I'm wondering what have y'all pulled off? Dish your wins.",1,1771439445.0,boompop,0,1.0,False

Background

This was our first time to Cancun and first time staying at an all inclusive so I don't have much to compare to but I will do my best with my review. We stayed for nine nights and It was just me and my partner both in our 30's and we were looking for a really quiet and low key resort to relax and think we picked perfectly :)

1) Booking 

We booked our flights and suite directly through the Excellence website. I swear I saw that we would get free airport transportation booking directly with them but when we got there and we're noted we had the charge I looked it up again before inquiring and saw that only suite bookings got free airport transfer and not suite PLUS flight bookings which I think is pretty silly but whatever. Unfortunately the transfers were pretty pricy (160 USD) but worth it for peace of mind. 

2) Landing, Transport, and Welcomeing

All of the transportation is through the partnered Seasons company and we felt well taken care of. About a week before we left on our trip we contacted seasons to book our transport with no issue. When we got through customs after landing we went to the transport pickup and someone directed us to the Seasons rep (there's a LOT of transport services) and they organized our transport who took us to the resort within a few minutes. The trip was about 40 minutes from the airport to the resort and you got to see a glimpse of Cancun proper. 

We were welcomed very warmly by everyone and it was super easy checking in and getting settled. From the time we checked in and told them we were there for our anniversary to getting to our room 10 minutes later someone had added a Happy Anniversary decoration to our door and we thought that was absolutely adorable. 

2) Location and Resort 

The resort is north of Cancun and part of an exclusive group of Playa Mujeres resorts behind some intensive security posts. Since it's away from the hotel zone it felt much more quiet and secluded. Beloved is beside a marina and some condos to one side and Excellence Playa Mujeres on the other side. 

Beloved itself had a very cozy and boutique feel to it which we LOVED. They have a few larger buildings and several small buildings with four suites to them so you feel like you are walking around a small community instead of a massive resort. It was very easy to get around and we found the resort was gorgeous with the sand and plants very well maintained. 

Even when the resort was at 100% capacity it didn't feel busy or crowded. We never saw anyone have any issues finding a spot or chair or access any services.

 

3) Suite 

We splurged and got a swim-up suite and were SO HAPPY we did this. This was the best part of the trip in my opinion and I didn't expect it. 

The suite was large with a gorgeous and massive shower and closet, a big bed, a couch/ living room area, and lastly, a gorgeous patio with a table and loungers right next to one of the pools. The view we had from our patio was gorgeous because again the resort grounds are really well taken care of and I felt like I was in a desert oasis with the sand, plants, and pool. 

Just a heads up, the swim up suites are located on the shade side if that is important to you (we overheard someone complaining to the front desk when we checked in). For us, it was perfect. We are from Canada and spend most of our time out of the sun anyways but it was warm and beautiful in the gentle shade on our patio, and if anyone really wants the sun they can walk 10 feet around the pool to loungers on the other side in full direct sun no issue. 

What I also loved about the swim up suites was easy access to everything. We were less than 100 feet from the taco truck and cafe and would just walk in and out of our suite to access everything with no hassle. Lastly, you get poop side service from there as staff make rounds and you can order drinks and food through them which was awesome. 

Overall we spent the majority of our time on our patio and in the pool here during our trip and it was amazing. 

4) Beach

Access to the beach was about 1-2 minutes from our suite and it's a very pretty walk through the resort to get there. 

There are plenty of chairs and shade and we never had an issue finding a spot on the beach. I was considering renting a private cabana for one day but in the end found no need to. 

The view was beautiful and you can see Isla Mujeres from the beach. 

What was most surprising to me and maybe a little underwhelming or a bit of a let down was the beach/ocean. 

There was a little bit of sargassum present on the beach and a moderate amount floating in the water. Whenever we went into the ocean we were touching it. I heard that it was less of a problem in Playa mujeres as well as it was ""low season"" so I couldn't even imagine what I would be like in times and spots with a lot. 

We read online that snorkeling gear was available and an activity off the beach but were let down when we were told on the beach that there was nothing to see and told us to go on an excursion to Isla Mujeres instead. I don't care to see much, was hoping we could at least putz around the beach and spot something but there was just the sargassum.

I was also surprised by the wind/choppines. All but two days the flag stayed as ""red"". We didn't see any green flag conditions once. I am not sure if this is normal or not but we were still able to swim and dip in without issue. 

5) Activities

The resort has a really nice spa and we got a free 30 minute hydrotherapy session with our booking that was SO much fun. You get the whole pool area to yourselves for the 30 minutes and a guide takes you around to do different activities such as various bubble jets and cold/warm showers, and nice sauna, and ending with a light scalp massage. It's easy to book in when you arrive and they have lots of availability. We originally were going to do more things at the spa but then decided to cancel to save some money as it's expensive (hundreds of USD). 

There are options again though Seasons to do some tours out of the resort. This included some longer ones such as Chichen Itza and Tulum. Although I love archaeology and history, we made the decision not to do one of these trips as they were super far away (~3 hours each way) and this was a relaxation trip. We were stoked to find out there was a half day tour (2-3 hours) to visit some ruins ~20 minutes away from the resort at El Meco. This was the perfect trip to get a taste of Maya culture and history. I think for the 2 of us it was 160 USD and it was just us on a private tour with our wonderful guide Iman. El Meco has new infrastructure being added to it in response to growing interest and that was awesome to see. 

The resort app listed all the activities each day so there was a lot going on. We participated in kayaking and the bike tour and it was fun as well as used the gym facility several times. 

Although Beloved itself doesn't have tennis/pickle ball courts, it does list it as available close by as Excellence Playa Mujeres beside has them. We inquired into playing there and I think they made it into a bit of a hassle as the concierge emailed them letting them know we were coming and then they had someone from our resort drive us over and they said it had to be after 12pm  and we had to let them know24 hours in advance. We did this once and then just walked back. When we wanted to play a second time we just walked over from the beach and up and played with no issue even in the morning before noon, so if anyone wants to use the tennis courts I would just suggest that. 

We also found out the juice bar at Excellence Playa Mujeres has fresh coconuts every day from 12-2 pm so we got a coconut on our way out after playing tennis and it was perfect haha. 

6) Food

The resort has enough restaurants and options to keep us busy with fresh variation for our full stay. We were satisfied with all the foods and had no complaints. Our top picks for food and snacks included the taco truck and the pastries, gelato, and coffee from the cafe (we are simple folk haha). 

7) Service 

We found everyone absolutely wonderful and attentive while we were there and appreciated all the staff. We tipped around 300-400 pesos a day and I hope that was enough (50 for bell hop, 50 daily for room, 50 for breakfast, lunch, cafe, 100 for dinner, 50 for pool/beach side drinks, 100 for transfers, and 300 for our private tour etc). I got a little stressed about tipping as I worry about some staff (eg hosts, maintenance, chefs etc) don't get the same tips but I tried not to over think it. People treated us the same regardless but I just wish I could give everyone a tip!

Overall we had an absolute amazing experience and our experience would have only been perfect with some better snorkeling off the beach.

During that time I kept noticing she gets blackout drunk when she drinks. Not to the point of passing out, but to the point of completely having altered personality and no memory of anything the next day. At first I chucked it off to her having recently started drinking again after 10 years of abstinence, because 10 years prior shit hit the fan with her drinking habits (late teens, early 20s). She thought she can drink safely and moderately now. So after 10 years of sobriety, I figured she doesn't know her limit. Plus it was summer, so I chucked it off to summer vibe.

But over time a pattern was noticeable. She would change moods in a heartbeat. She would go from angry to horny and back. It was impossible to keep up. She would become mean and insult me. For example, if she became horny but all I could see was a drunk woman and didn't feel like having sex, she would get mad, leave the house, throw some tantrums, threaten that there are guys who will if I wont, etc. She would also pick fights out of nowhere. One time we were about to go to sleep when she just imagined I ""was looking at some woman"" the day before and was mean about it. The whole thing was nonsense. The next morning she would have no recollection of it and would apologize and say she won't do it again.



I started telling her when sober ""I don't like it when you drink, you become someone else, I would prefer if you didn't drink like you didn't for 10 years"". She would agree that its a waste of whole day being hungover and would apologize for being mean, but claimed she has no recollection of that. These kinds of fights were becoming often.

  
After summer there was a nice period where we didn't go out as much and had less opportunity to drink. I almost forgot about that problem. But there was another problem. She was reluctant to meet my friends. Claimed she is introverted and has social anxiety. But there are a few really close friends of mine, also couples, and it didn't make sense to keep her hidden forever. 

  
One time we had friends over, she gave me a beer and had a beer for herself. Next thing I know, my beer is gone, and theres a few more bottles of beer on the table. When I said ""where's my beer? you must be drinking them in one gulp!?"" she got mad and ruined the evening with her behavior. She ignored my friends, didn't participate in activities anymore, went on balcony to smoke, etc. Cue another fight and another talk tomorrow about her drinking habits.

  
I can't even remember all those kinds of events. It became something predictable to me. I became almost immune to those fights, I was just going through the motions ""ok now she's leaving...ok now she's back...now she's yelling, now she's insulting my friends, now she's dancing and asking me to have sex...."". I started to lose patience so I would sometimes try to nip that in the bud by being rude myself.  Other times I would just read a book while she's having a meltdown.

  
One major event happened on a friend's birthday party (same friend from before). In a group of 10 people, where she only knows 2, she was the only one to get drunk. She got so drunk, her head was just hanging above the plate on the table and she couldn't talk. When we left I scolded her saying ""you embarrassed yourself and me. This is the first impression you are leaving for those people"" etc. We got into a huge fight with her classic exiting and entering the house, insulting, etc. I just tried to go to bed but she was relentless. At one point I yelled ""get in or get out, just leave me alone"" and she started hugging me and crying saying ""I won't leave you alone"". 

  
The next day and over the course of some time I kept telling her I've had enough. I do not have it in me to live another one of those scenes. If she has another drink, I am gone.

She said ""you cannot expect me never to have another drink, not even for cheers at some events."" and said I am pressuring her. Said it would be better to just leave her next time she does it than to announce it like this. Said that she can drink moderately and she will never repeat those kinds of scenes again. I said I don't believe she can drink moderately and I won't risk it. If she has another drop, I'm gone.

  
Then there was another major gathering where she, even in the morning while driving there (I'm driving), had some liquor. I was not happy about it, but I got a little soft because I understand she is under pressure because of the gathering with her anxiety and all. She had some drinks, but did not get drunk and the event went fine.

A week after that we went to another couple because they are inviting us to their wedding and she never met them. They offered some drinks, she chose wine. I watched her drink 4 glasses by the time I had one glass of beer. I started pointing it out to her that she needs to slow down and mind her drinking. She did not like that. She ended up getting drunk there.

On the way home I started saying ""you did it again. what did I say will happen if you do it again? do you want to break up? do you just want to push me to do it?""

  
She just started dancing drunkenly in the car, insulting my friends, telling me to shut up, etc. When she got mean, and knowing what's in store for me for the rest of the evening, the words ""that's it. we're done, you will take your stuff and go home tonight"" just came out of me.



She started slamming the doors, throwing stuff around the house, started saying some guy will pick her up. When I said ""I am taking you home right now"" she said ""I will leave when I feel like it"".

At that moment I just saw my entire evening in a glimpse and decided I will not live out another one of those endless traumatic scenes. I took my phone out and dialed 911. Told them ""I have a weird situation. My ex refuses to leave my house"". When she heard I'm serious, she started hitting me and kicking me. I told the cops ""as we speak, she is hitting me, hurry up"". After I hung up, she continued to kick me. I forcibly took her out of the house and locked the doors.



Then she started slamming on the doors with her hands and feet and endlessly ringing the doorbell. She did not say a word, she was a zombie. She was just kicking the doors for like 10 minutes. At that point I knew there's no going back. The whole neighbourhood is witnessing this. I started recording it for police and to share it with some people to keep me in check. There is no more ignoring this. We are not going to forget about this in the morning like always. This time there will be consequences.



Then she left and stopped the first car that drove by. It was accidentally a guy I know, but she doesn't. She asked him to drive her home. During the trip she even accused him of ""wanting to fuck her"" which I'm afraid was more of an invitation than anything. Like I said, she gets extremely horny drunk and from the stories she told me about that 10+ years earlier, many people were happy about her drinking.



Then she came back to my house and started endlessly ringing the doorbell again. Then the cops showed up and handcuffed her and took her to the station where she spent the night. I did not intend on her spending the night in jail. I thought cops will come and she will fear the authority and leave, but because they have it on recording that she hit me, it had to be jail.



The next day she called me and cried and apologized and all that. I told her it's the end, I cannot save her. I took all her stuff back to her apartment so there is nothing for her to come back for.



We met a few days later out of my weakness. She said she is done with alcohol for life, that this was a wakeup call she needed, that she will change her ways, that she is ready for a life in line with her age, that she wants to be clean, focused, have a family, etc. I said I don't think she'll change. She tried once 10 years ago and again slipped. Next stressful moment will reset her habits again, I cannot risk it. We both cried and I told her she needs to give up on me.

  
There you have it. And after all this, I am still second guessing myself, wondering if I can give her another chance, maybe she will get her act together after this.

  
Even without alcohol she was picking stupid fights, kept the house a mess, showed no real capability for responsibility, etc. We fought daily. All my friends hate her now and do not want me to entertain the idea of getting back to her for one second. I have a hard time dealing with her promiscuous past, mostly alcohol driven.

  
But on the other hand, when things were great she was a sweetheart. I never doubted her love for me, that she is dedicated to me, that she prioritizes me. I felt loved and I loved her. She's extremely funny and we could talk about anything. I loved just going for coffee with her. Lots of great memories between us. The fights she would pick could also be quickly resolved. I wonder if I didn't have the right approach, didn't support her in the way she needed. I miss her.

1r8azjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensDiscipline/comments/1r8azjt/how_to_stop_caring_what_people_think_psychology/,How to Stop Caring What People Think: psychology tricks that actually work,"Real talk: I spent years in a mental prison I didn't even know I'd built. Every decision filtered through ""what will they think?"" Every outfit, every opinion, every Instagram caption analyzed to death. It wasn't until I dove deep into psychology research, self help books, and countless hours of therapy adjacent podcasts that I realized this wasn't just my problem. It's basically a societal epidemic at this point.

Here's what nobody tells you: your brain is literally wired to care about social approval. We evolved in tribes where rejection meant death, so your anxiety about Karen from accounting judging your presentation? That's just your amygdala doing its job. The good news is you can rewire this shit through consistent practice and the right mental tools.

**Reality check your thoughts**

Start catching yourself mid spiral. When you're catastrophizing about what someone might think, pause and ask: ""Is this actually true or am I fortune telling?"" Most of the time you're creating elaborate fiction in your head. Research from cognitive behavioral therapy shows that like 90% of what we worry about never happens. I learned this from ""Feeling Good"" by David Burns (the OG CBT bible, written by a Stanford psychiatrist). This book literally changed how I process anxious thoughts. The mood log technique alone is worth the read. Insanely practical.

**Distinguish between opinions that matter vs noise**

Not all feedback deserves equal weight. Brené Brown talks about this in her research on vulnerability, she calls it having a ""square squad"" of people whose opinions actually matter. For everyone else? Their judgment says more about them than you. I use this mental filter constantly now. Random internet stranger hates my taste in music? Cool, they're not in my square. My mentor gives me constructive feedback? That's worth considering.

**Exposure therapy for your ego**

This sounds harsh but deliberately do small things that invite judgment. Wear that weird shirt. Share an unpopular opinion. Order the complicated coffee order. Start tiny. The app ""Finch"" actually helped me build this habit by gamifying daily challenges that pushed my comfort zone. It's designed for habit building and mental health, and honestly made the whole process less intimidating.

**Understand the spotlight effect**

Yale psychologist Thomas Gilovich proved that people notice our mistakes way less than we think. Everyone's too busy worrying about themselves to obsess over you. I repeat this like a mantra when I'm spiraling. That embarrassing thing you said at the party? They forgot about it by the time they got home. You're not the main character in everyone else's story.

**Build self validation from within**

This is the real work. Stop outsourcing your self worth to external validation. The book ""The Six Pillars of Self Esteem"" by Nathaniel Branden breaks this down beautifully. He's basically the godfather of self esteem psychology. The sentence completion exercises in there are confronting but they force you to build that internal foundation.

For anyone wanting to go deeper on this but struggling to find time for all these books, there's this app called BeFreed that's been helpful. It's an AI-powered learning platform that pulls from psychology books, research papers, and expert insights to create personalized audio content based on what you're working on. Like you could type in ""I'm a chronic people pleaser who wants to build genuine confidence"" and it'll build you a structured learning plan pulling from sources like Brené Brown's research, CBT techniques, and self-esteem psychology.

What makes it work is the customization. You can get a quick 10-minute overview or switch to a 40-minute deep dive with examples when something clicks. The voice options are actually addictive, there's this sarcastic narrator style that makes dense psychology way more digestible. Built by former Google AI folks, so the content stays grounded in actual science. Beats doomscrolling and it's designed to adapt as you learn.

**Notice when you're people pleasing**

People pleasing is just anxiety wearing a helpful mask. Start saying no to things you don't want to do. Start stating preferences instead of always deferring. This feels wildly uncomfortable at first because you're breaking decades of conditioning. But every time you honor your actual wants and needs, you're sending your nervous system the message that you matter.

**Consume content that reinforces this mindset**

I'm obsessed with Mark Manson's stuff for this. ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck"" is obviously on the nose here, but his blog posts dive even deeper into the psychology of why we care so much and how to recalibrate. It's not about becoming a selfish dick, it's about becoming more selective with where you invest your emotional energy.

The shift doesn't happen overnight. Your brain's spent years reinforcing these neural pathways. But every time you catch yourself seeking external validation and redirect back to your own values, you're literally restructuring your brain. Neuroplasticity is real.

Some days I still catch myself crafting texts for maximum likability or second guessing decisions based on imaginary judgment. The difference now is I notice it happening and can course correct. That's the goal. Not perfection, just awareness and consistent practice.

When I crossed paths with my boss near the coffee maker, I was too chipper. Scared he would be unhappy with me for missing work yesterday, and overcompensating. 

I saw someone in an SUV clip a bicyclist yesterday morning. Like, the actually hit the back wheel of their bike. 

It was on the way to dropping my son off at school. I had tensed up when the cyclist had driven past me, a few moments before. And I kept him in my line of sight. I am generally hyper aware of cyclists and pedestrians. 

I have a huge fear of hitting them. I often convince myself that I've hit someone, and then I get into a loop of doubling back to check. 

The cyclist  and the SUV waited side by side at the red light. The cyclist was in the bike lane waiting to go straight and the SUV was waiting to make a right turn.   
  
I don't understand how the SUV driver had failed to see the kid on the bike. 

I only saw the bicyclist from behind. But I think he was a middle schooler, I think he was heading to the middle school up the road.   
  
I used to teach at that middle school, like...five years ago. Middle school kids are the same age as the Strange Things kids, in seasons one and two. 

Anyhow, I don't understand how the driver of the SUV had failed to see the cyclist come up along side his passenger side, as the SUV was pulling out into the intersection preparing to make the turn. 

The cyclist's wheel was pinned for a moment, and he couldn't advance forward. He almost fell off his bike. 

The SUV blared their horn at him. As though it was the kid's fault, that the SUV driver was not paying attention. BLARED THEIR HORN AT HIM. 

Almost ran him over then blared their horn at him. 

I thought about adding my own horn to the mix. But I thought better of it, in case the kid would think I was honking at him, not the SUV driver. 

But i did hear myself scream ""YOU MOTHER FUCKER YOU ALMOST HIT HIM! YOU *MOTHER FUCKER*! WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING!"" 

The SUV and bicyclist managed to extricate themselves from one another and the kid cycled onwards, though I'm pretty sure his back wheel was now bent and his bike had a slight wobble to it. 

But all my windows were up and the only person who'd managed to hear me was my son, sitting in the back seat. 

""I'm sorry. I'm sorry for my language."" I said ""She almost hit him, that's terrible. People need to watch where they're going right? Are you okay? I'm glad that kid is okay...""  
  
I thought for a moment...about whether there was anything more I was supposed to do in regards to this matter. ...Report it to the police?   
  
The kid seemed okay, and both the kid and the SUV were now already going their separate ways.   
  
...Was I supposed to have foreseen that and prevented it? I am always foreseeing catastrophe. If I intervened every time I thought catastrophe was imminent, I would just be a constant, malfunctioning alarm to be silenced. 

Everyone was fine. 

I drove my son to morning drop off. 

Wished him a good day. 

I had already called in sick to work. 

I had sweated too much the night before.   
  
I shower at night, I don't budget enough time for a morning shower.   
  
I had gotten too little sleep the night before and I had somehow soaked my sheets in sweat and I was worried I might have an unemployably offensive odor if anyone at work stood too close to me. 

But i drove on to the mall.

1r8axh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancun/comments/1r8axh8/beloved_playa_mujeres_review/,Beloved Playa Mujeres Review,"Hi everyone! I just returned from my trip and thought I would provide my review of Beloved as it may be helpful for others doing some research. 

Background

This was our first time to Cancun and first time staying at an all inclusive so I don't have much to compare to but I will do my best with my review. We stayed for nine nights and It was just me and my partner both in our 30's and we were looking for a really quiet and low key resort to relax and think we picked perfectly :)

1) Booking 

We booked our flights and suite directly through the Excellence website. I swear I saw that we would get free airport transportation booking directly with them but when we got there and we're noted we had the charge I looked it up again before inquiring and saw that only suite bookings got free airport transfer and not suite PLUS flight bookings which I think is pretty silly but whatever. Unfortunately the transfers were pretty pricy (160 USD) but worth it for peace of mind. 

2) Landing, Transport, and Welcomeing

All of the transportation is through the partnered Seasons company and we felt well taken care of. About a week before we left on our trip we contacted seasons to book our transport with no issue. When we got through customs after landing we went to the transport pickup and someone directed us to the Seasons rep (there's a LOT of transport services) and they organized our transport who took us to the resort within a few minutes. The trip was about 40 minutes from the airport to the resort and you got to see a glimpse of Cancun proper. 

We were welcomed very warmly by everyone and it was super easy checking in and getting settled. From the time we checked in and told them we were there for our anniversary to getting to our room 10 minutes later someone had added a Happy Anniversary decoration to our door and we thought that was absolutely adorable. 

2) Location and Resort 

The resort is north of Cancun and part of an exclusive group of Playa Mujeres resorts behind some intensive security posts. Since it's away from the hotel zone it felt much more quiet and secluded. Beloved is beside a marina and some condos to one side and Excellence Playa Mujeres on the other side. 

Beloved itself had a very cozy and boutique feel to it which we LOVED. They have a few larger buildings and several small buildings with four suites to them so you feel like you are walking around a small community instead of a massive resort. It was very easy to get around and we found the resort was gorgeous with the sand and plants very well maintained. 

Even when the resort was at 100% capacity it didn't feel busy or crowded. We never saw anyone have any issues finding a spot or chair or access any services.

 

3) Suite 

We splurged and got a swim-up suite and were SO HAPPY we did this. This was the best part of the trip in my opinion and I didn't expect it. 

The suite was large with a gorgeous and massive shower and closet, a big bed, a couch/ living room area, and lastly, a gorgeous patio with a table and loungers right next to one of the pools. The view we had from our patio was gorgeous because again the resort grounds are really well taken care of and I felt like I was in a desert oasis with the sand, plants, and pool. 

Just a heads up, the swim up suites are located on the shade side if that is important to you (we overheard someone complaining to the front desk when we checked in). For us, it was perfect. We are from Canada and spend most of our time out of the sun anyways but it was warm and beautiful in the gentle shade on our patio, and if anyone really wants the sun they can walk 10 feet around the pool to loungers on the other side in full direct sun no issue. 

What I also loved about the swim up suites was easy access to everything. We were less than 100 feet from the taco truck and cafe and would just walk in and out of our suite to access everything with no hassle. Lastly, you get poop side service from there as staff make rounds and you can order drinks and food through them which was awesome. 

Overall we spent the majority of our time on our patio and in the pool here during our trip and it was amazing. 

4) Beach

Access to the beach was about 1-2 minutes from our suite and it's a very pretty walk through the resort to get there. 

There are plenty of chairs and shade and we never had an issue finding a spot on the beach. I was considering renting a private cabana for one day but in the end found no need to. 

The view was beautiful and you can see Isla Mujeres from the beach. 

What was most surprising to me and maybe a little underwhelming or a bit of a let down was the beach/ocean. 

There was a little bit of sargassum present on the beach and a moderate amount floating in the water. Whenever we went into the ocean we were touching it. I heard that it was less of a problem in Playa mujeres as well as it was ""low season"" so I couldn't even imagine what I would be like in times and spots with a lot. 

We read online that snorkeling gear was available and an activity off the beach but were let down when we were told on the beach that there was nothing to see and told us to go on an excursion to Isla Mujeres instead. I don't care to see much, was hoping we could at least putz around the beach and spot something but there was just the sargassum.

I was also surprised by the wind/choppines. All but two days the flag stayed as ""red"". We didn't see any green flag conditions once. I am not sure if this is normal or not but we were still able to swim and dip in without issue. 

5) Activities

The resort has a really nice spa and we got a free 30 minute hydrotherapy session with our booking that was SO much fun. You get the whole pool area to yourselves for the 30 minutes and a guide takes you around to do different activities such as various bubble jets and cold/warm showers, and nice sauna, and ending with a light scalp massage. It's easy to book in when you arrive and they have lots of availability. We originally were going to do more things at the spa but then decided to cancel to save some money as it's expensive (hundreds of USD). 

There are options again though Seasons to do some tours out of the resort. This included some longer ones such as Chichen Itza and Tulum. Although I love archaeology and history, we made the decision not to do one of these trips as they were super far away (~3 hours each way) and this was a relaxation trip. We were stoked to find out there was a half day tour (2-3 hours) to visit some ruins ~20 minutes away from the resort at El Meco. This was the perfect trip to get a taste of Maya culture and history. I think for the 2 of us it was 160 USD and it was just us on a private tour with our wonderful guide Iman. El Meco has new infrastructure being added to it in response to growing interest and that was awesome to see. 

The resort app listed all the activities each day so there was a lot going on. We participated in kayaking and the bike tour and it was fun as well as used the gym facility several times. 

Although Beloved itself doesn't have tennis/pickle ball courts, it does list it as available close by as Excellence Playa Mujeres beside has them. We inquired into playing there and I think they made it into a bit of a hassle as the concierge emailed them letting them know we were coming and then they had someone from our resort drive us over and they said it had to be after 12pm  and we had to let them know24 hours in advance. We did this once and then just walked back. When we wanted to play a second time we just walked over from the beach and up and played with no issue even in the morning before noon, so if anyone wants to use the tennis courts I would just suggest that. 

We also found out the juice bar at Excellence Playa Mujeres has fresh coconuts every day from 12-2 pm so we got a coconut on our way out after playing tennis and it was perfect haha. 

6) Food

The resort has enough restaurants and options to keep us busy with fresh variation for our full stay. We were satisfied with all the foods and had no complaints. Our top picks for food and snacks included the taco truck and the pastries, gelato, and coffee from the cafe (we are simple folk haha). 

7) Service 

We found everyone absolutely wonderful and attentive while we were there and appreciated all the staff. We tipped around 300-400 pesos a day and I hope that was enough (50 for bell hop, 50 daily for room, 50 for breakfast, lunch, cafe, 100 for dinner, 50 for pool/beach side drinks, 100 for transfers, and 300 for our private tour etc). I got a little stressed about tipping as I worry about some staff (eg hosts, maintenance, chefs etc) don't get the same tips but I tried not to over think it. People treated us the same regardless but I just wish I could give everyone a tip!

Overall we had an absolute amazing experience and our experience would have only been perfect with some better snorkeling off the beach.

I really felt awful at the 12-hour mark and the hunger started kicking in extreme around 13½. Didn't help that I had to cook for my kids and husband between the 12-13 hour mark. 😬 I really want to make the full 24 hours.

It's the hexagonal one that folds like a camping chair. Really convenient and fun but looks cheap. 

I never did trampoline before therefore I don't have any point of comparison. 

I'm starting slow to avoid further joint issues, therefore I'm dispatching several short rebounder sessions that are really fun through the days, and I'm happy to rebound a bit before going to work to enhance the mood. Nothing crazy in the morning, a couple of minutes boucing with my feet staying on the mat. I get nauseous and slightly dizzy a few minutes after moderately rebounding on an empty stomach. I rarely eat before 10am, not hungry, not going to change that.

I get the same effect when I drink tea instead of coffee on an empty stomach (which would be due to tannins according to the internet). I used to jog 20 minutes on an empty stomach first thing in the morning when I was younger and I never had an issue.

Is this rebounder nausea a concern? Should I try longer to see if it goes away. Any experience of that?",3,1771439021.0,Rebounding,2,1.0,False

Jonh Grace was on his daily run when suddently, entities stopped appearing.Carnation disapeared behind him, slugfish goes trough the door behind him and disapears, Doombringer evaporates from his hands, Sorrow just...disapears (must be dry season).

Suddently, somebody, something, appears.It looks like somebody did a sketch of an entity and never finished it.It had no legs, it just floated there.It's eyes are covered by a thick black bar, as if his entity must remain secret.

*""Hello Jonh, I am Blashfepmy""*

Jonh is confused, he knows some entities have to be added, like Koo-Koo, but this one never appeared

*""Why so serious?I only come bearing a small offer...:*

He extends his hand and a wheel with multiple symbols appears

*""He won't mind a few spins...Your God...Maybe you will find my offers interesting...""*

He dosen't look related to **[REDACTED]** so Jonh spins the wheel.What's the worst that could happend?

**------------**

Jonh Grace was on his daily run when suddenly, entities stopped appearing. Carnation disapeared behind him, slugfish goes through the door behind him and disapears, Doombringer evaporates from his hands, Sorrow just...disapears (must be dry season).

Suddenly, somebody, something, appears.It looks like somebody did a sketch of an entity and never finished it.It had no legs, it just floated there.The only thing solid, well drawn about him is a black bar covering his eyes.He wears a fractured top hat and has multiple symbols around his hat and his coat.

*""Hello Jonh, I am Blashfepmy""*

Jonh is confused, he knows some entities have to be added, like Koo-Koo, but this one never appeared

*""Why so serious?I only come bearing a small offer...:*

He dosen't look related to **[REDACTED]** so Jonh spins the wheel.What's the worst that could happend?

**-----**

**The stage**

When Jonh spins the wheel, he is teleported to a stage.It has the same wheel Blasphemy had on his hand stands on the center of the room.The room looks like Blaphemy, sketched...

Blasphemy appears besides him

*""Welcome to my little slice of...purgatory?I mean, God didn't give me a slice of heaven and* **[REDACTED]** *didn't give me a slice of hell""*

You sit down, Blasphemy seems nice enough.But the chair is a bit bumby, the artist could have finished drawing the chair at least...

*""The wheel is already spinning Jonh, shall we see where you land next?""*

The wheel stops.A moon and a star appear

*""I love this one!I love mazes!I love big black cubes!And so does the public!""*

Cheers come out of nowhere and a trapdoor opens bellow you and the moment you look down you fall

**------**
 
**Islam**

Jonh hit the ground.It is different from what he is used to, it feels more...Like sand and the air has more humidity.The walls look like they are made of sand and he sees 4 doors, going 4 ways.Odd, it usualy always went in a straight line.In the center, or at least what looks like it, you see a giant cube.

In one of the walls, you see 3 papers, you pick then up.You read them carefully, there is no timer so you don't worry much.

**Prayer**
There is an image on the first paper, it shows you kneling towards the cube and...Praying?Is God inside that cube or something?The second image shows a yellow line going trough some doors.

The text says ""Pray and I show you the way"".

Weird, the yellow is usually how God helps you.He is also here?Maybe that new entity thing wasn't lying, maybe God actually dosen't mind the wheel

**Command**
The second paper shows a drawing of a stone.It has something written in it.You can't make it out with the drawing.

The text (not the drawing one to be clear), says ""Follow the orders or face punishement""

Hmmm, keep an eye out for a rock, got it.

**Sea of the dead**
The third one is the weirdest, it shows the labyrint you are in.It shows a path to the center, likely not the real path, but behind the drawing you there is a wall of water, and it has a line pointing to you.

You look behind and HOLLY F*!&@^@>;×' THAT'S A LOT OF WATER.

You start running trough the doors, guess the timer changed this time.You start running, you get nowhere, every room looks the same.Some have blocked doors, others require **Parkour** to get past but you where nowhere near the cube.And with the usual entities still appearing you don't have time to think.While hiding from Carnation you decide to pray, and God shows you the way to the cube, you follow it but after a few seconds it disapears.

You keep running, the water right behind you, but then you see it.A rock and something invisible is writing on it.You aproach it and it says ""Thou shall bow"", you crouch.And you keep walking, you can still slide but you are afraid of getting up.After a few rooms you feel the weight coming off you and manage to get up.And you are still alive.

This goes on for a bit more.With a few prayers and having to stop running, walljumping, using your itens.You have to pass trough the water to get there because you weren't fast enough.But you still manage to reach the cube and escape.

**------**

You touch the cube and you are back to the studio.Blasphemy just kicked Doombringer out of the room.Guess he dosen't have much control here.

*""Ah.""*

He turns to face you

*""Sorry, a small pest problem, did you like this chllenge?I am not sure if you are sweating or the water got to you...""*

The wheel spins again

*""So, I assume you didn't like it.You aren't much of a talker right?I have much more to show you...Maybe one of the other options will be if your liking""*

The wheel stops once again.Now a start appears, you are worried for a few seconds but then you realize it isn't a pentagram.

(Goddam translator on my keyboard, I already had this whole ass section written now I have to start all over again.)

*""Ah, this one is great.A bit of an odd smell but one of my favourites.Let's see if you enjoy it.""*

A comically large cane pulls out you of the stage

**------**

**Judaism**

(I apoligize because it might be offensive to some.)

You drop into the new area.It looks more familiar since it goes straight foward, but it feels more opressive.It feels like a prision.And you only see a light at the end of the tunnel and something is marching behind you so you start running, reading some papers along the way.

**Toxic**
(Not my entity, I took it out of a posy I saw here.Idk the name of the author but all credit goes to him on this entity)

The paper shows a green gas on a room.Probably the simplest paper explaing an entity you ever saw.The text says ""Breath it's air and you are dead"".Also a very self explanatory entity, maybe only beaten by the pits.

**March**
The paper shows an army behind you.If they catch you, you are gone.The text says ""You have a head start, don't let them catch you"".The lack of a timer must mean you can outrun them if you are fast enough

**Famine**
The paper is a lot darker and more old than normal.It shows a horse, a very skinny horse that has enough skin to cover it's bones but no meat on them.It seems to aproach you but flashing it must send it backwards.The text says ""Feed it light, but you don't have a limited suplly""

You start running.The usual guys appear but they also took the darker, more opressive, color scheme of this place.

You finally meet Toxic, it lasts for a few rooms but you manage to escape, but it's thick fog makes it hard to see.While inside it, you also meet Famine, and it absorved the light you used to flash Rue, Rue and Famine where still sent back but your light got weaker.

When you reach the end, there is an impressive sight.A corridor and the walls are water.You traverse it and...


**----**

...you are back in the studio. But instead of Blasphemy greatimg you it's Mime.It says something, nothing you understand nothing what he says and he just gives you a rose.Othed entities appear and he points to them.Before you can even figure ouy what's going on Blashphemy appears sipping a cup of coffee.

*""MIME.I ALREADY TOLD YOU I AM RECORDING, YOU CAN DO YOUR STUPID DATING SHOW AFTER I'M DONE""*

Mime and the other entities leave the stage with some sadness on their face, or is mime sadness on his body?Like, he is all face.

*""I apoligize, this happens sometimes.So, did you enjoy it?I can smell ""eau de eye"" in you.But I can see by your face you didn't enjoy it.Well, the weel already chose your next destination anyways so see ya!""*

Before you can even look at the wheel your seat ejects you.

**--------**

**Pagan**

You somehow fall into the ground, even tho you were ejected.You have been trough weirder.You look around and see the moon above.No stars, just a moon.

The room looks old, like ancient ruins old.Maybe somewhere betwen Roman and Greek architecture?But a lot of plants are already growing on the walls and there is a beautifull giant tree in the distance.Covering a lot of rooms further ahead.

You see a few drawings on the wall, guess the usual papers disapeared.

**Moon Phases**

The first mural you see depicts the moon and it's various phases.Bellow each moon there is the usual rooms.But they get more complex the more moon the phase shows and they have more entities.The full moon phase is scratched out.There is no text, at least no text you understand

A few more rooms ahead you see another mural

**Ancient ritual**

It depicts some kind of ritual.You see a big circle and a knife.It seems that to pass you must kill something or offer something.You can't say for sure, but there must be some challege related to these rooms.They also seem fairly big on the mural.

You can decipher a bit of the text, it says ""Find a >!words words words!< to pass, or face >! You don't have to click this, it's just to show stuff you cam't translate!<"" you can't understand much more

And then you see a very well lit mural, a very menincingly lit mural

**Wrath**
The mural is slightly broken, but you cam see the drawing.It shows a beast above the rooms trowing stuff and pulling levers.It seems to throw disasters at you.

**Light puzzle**
While you explore the rooms, you find a new one.The mural shows somebody putting a torch next to a hole in the wall.

You don't have a torch but you do have a flashlight.You flash the holes in the wall and the door opens

You look up, you don't see this entity but the moon is getting fuller, and fast.You start running.

For a while, not many entities appear but as the moon progress, more appear.And more.You finally discover what ""Wrath"" does when a meteor barelly misses you and a tornado pulls you back and you see rooms flooding out of nowhere.

But on the final room, you find the ritual circle and a knife.It wasn't that many rooms until here.But there is no door to leave, or keep going.You pick up the knife and hear something behind you.You go back, avoiding all entities that come and find a **[REDACTED]** you catch it and take it to the ritual room and...

1r8asvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1r8asvh/two_alphas_same_betrayal/,"Two Alphas, Same Betrayal","Chapter 1

My daughter was critically ill, and we desperately needed a large sum for her treatment.

Yet, my Alpha mate, Mason, outright refused to pay. He simply gave up on our daughter, turned his back, and ran into the arms of his childhood sweetheart, Thea Allen.

In that moment of utter despair, my first love,Alpha Adrian, appeared like a lifeline. He transferred five million into my account and stayed by my side, tenderly helping me care for our little girl.

But in the end, she still couldn't escape death's cruel grasp.

Six years later, I was pregnant with Adrian's child.

During a solo prenatal checkup at the hospital, I accidentally overheard a conversation between Adrian and the pack doctor,

""Alpha, now that you and Luna are expecting your own child... what if the truth about what happened back then comes to light?""

""When Thea was critically ill, using certain... methods to transplant that child's heart into her was a desperate necessity. Besides, Sophia is having a baby now. She should be able to move on.""

In that instant, my world shattered. I finally understood,my daughter hadn't died from a misdiagnosed illness. She had been deliberately misdiagnosed. Adrian had secretly taken her heart and transplanted it into Thea.

Tears streamed down my face silently.

So this life growing inside me now was no testament to love between Adrian and me. It was an offering of atonement.

All these six years of affection had been Adrian’s elaborate act, a charade for his true destined mate, his one and only beloved, Thea.

I gently touched my slightly rounded belly, a bitter smile curling my lips.

Six years ago, I couldn't save my daughter. Now, I had no desire to continue this cursed relationship.

In the hospital office, the pack doctor sighed softly, his tone tinged with pity,

""Very well, Alpha. But is this truly worth it? Miss Thea Allen has already bonded with another. You should live your own life. After all, Luna loves you deeply. She's a good woman.""

There was a pause before Adrian replied with firm resolve:

""How could it not be worth it? I care nothing for titles or bonds. As long as I can watch over Thea, protect her, that's enough. She's free to love whomever she wishes. I only need her to be healthy and happy.""

""As for Sophia... she is indeed wonderful. A good mate, and she'll be a good mother. It's just... I don't love her. You can't force love.""

Hearing this, the doctor shook his head and didn't press further.

""Luna's pregnancy is very unstable. She has suffered greatly, having already lost one child. This time, please be kind to her and the baby.""

A long silence followed before Adrian finally responded with a soft, ""Mm.""

I bit my lip hard, stubbornly refusing to make a sound.

Only after Adrian and the doctor left did I break down, sobbing uncontrollably.

So, my newborn daughter has not die of disease. She had been intentionally misdiagnosed after Adrian bribed the pack hospital. All to give Thea with a fresh, healthy heart.

Back then, after my daughter was diagnosed and admitted in the NICU, my former mate,Alpha Mason, saw her as a burden. He washed his hands of the whole thing, walked out of the hospital, and ran straight into Thea's waiting arms.

Adrian's arrival had been the only ray of light in our darkness.

Now, looking back, Adrian's help was likely just to better safeguard the heart destined for Thea.

After I dissolved my mating bond with Mason, Adrian married me,probably driven by nothing more than guilt.

Leaving the hospital, I stepped into a downpour.

I did not call for a car. Like a drowned rat, I staggered home, drenched to the bone.

Rain mixed with tears, I'd long lost count of how many times I'd cried.

When I finally got home, the housekeeper, Mrs. Anderson, saw my bedraggled, broken state and hurried over.

""Luna! Why didn't you call the driver in this rain? You're with child,catching a chill is the last thing you need.""

Hearing the commotion, Adrian came out of his study. Seeing my red-rimmed eyes and disheveled hair, a flicker of something remorse crossed his eyes. He set down his coffee cup and scooped me into his arms.

His tone held a note of reproach, ""You're going to be a mother. How can you still be so reckless like a child?""

""You could catch a cold, but what if you hurt the baby? I really don't know what to do with you.""

I glanced at him and murmured, almost to myself, ""Adrian, I've been a mother before. You don't need to teach me.""

""If this child dies, it dies. After all, I've already lost one.""

Adrian's steps hitched. His brow furrowed, but in the end, he said nothing.

The bathtub was already filled with hot water. Adrian tried to help me out of my wet clothes, but I refused and pushed his hands away.

He looked at me suspiciously, clearly puzzled by my abnormal behavior.

After a tense standoff, Adrian finally left the bathroom.

In the mirror, I saw the mating mark on my neck. It was no longer as vivid as it before, it had faded, grown dull.

I scrubbed my skin raw with soap,again and again, as if trying to wash away every trace Adrian had left on me over all these years.

Chapter 2

By the time I returned to the bedroom, Adrian was already fast asleep.

Gazing at the profile of the man I'd shared my life with for years, I felt nothing but profound alienation.

Lost in his dreams, Adrian reached out and grasped my hand.

""Don't go... stay with me forever.""

""Thea.""

An expression of infinite tenderness and dependence softened Adrian's face,a look he had never once shown me.

In that next moment, his phone screen lit up.

A notification from a contact saved as ""Princess Thea.""

I tried several passwords, but none worked. Not my birthday, not Adrian's, not even Thea's.

On my last attempt, I entered the date of our daughter's death.

Unexpectedly, it unlocked.

I had almost forgotten,the day our daughter died was the day Thea was reborn, with her heart. Of course Adrian would commemorate it this way.

The chat log opened. Thea had sent several photos.

In them, Thea's smile outshone the warmest March sun. She nestled against Adrian's side like a delicate bird, while he, his movements slightly awkward, mirrored her heart-shaped gesture.

""Alpha Adrian, going to the amusement park is always more fun with you. Alpha Mason is so boring by comparison.""

""Don't forget our photoshoot tomorrow,don’t stand me up! Love you.""

Adrian and Thea looked every bit like a new couple in love, leaving me feeling like a clown intruding on someone else's happiness.

But tomorrow... tomorrow was the day Adrian had promised to accompany me to my prenatal checkup.

So, which mattered more? The unborn child, or the woman he cherished?

I didn't sleep a wink that night.

I was making a bet.

If Adrian chose to accompany me to the checkup tomorrow, then for the sake of this new life, I would give him one final chance.

The next morning, Adrian rose early, getting ready to leave,pure delight on his face.

Just as he was about to step out, I caught the hem of his shirt.

""Adrian, where are you going? You promised to come with me to the checkup today.""

The smile vanished from Adrian's face. After a long pause, he patted my hand gently.

""Sophia, I'm sorry. I have a very important meeting today. I won't be able to make it to the hospital with you.""

""You're always so understanding. I'm sure you can understand how hard I'm working, right?""

""Besides, you said it yourself yesterday,you have been through childbirth before. You'll be fine without me.""

Seeing me hang my head in silence, Adrian smiled and pressed a kiss to my forehead.

""Be good. Listen to me. I'll bring you a gift when I'm back.""

With that, he turned and left without a backward glance.

Watching his retreating figure hurry off,my heart finally shattered completely.

I bought a one-way ticket to far southern city.

In three days, I would say goodbye to this place, and to everything here, for good.

Chapter 3

I applied light makeup, just enough to hide the worst of my exhaustion.

My destination was the city's most prestigious law firm. I needed to consult on two matters,the formal dissolution of our mating bond, and the pursuit of justice for my daughter's wrongful death.

The paperwork to sever the bond was quickly drafted.

Holding Adrian and Thea accountable, however, would require far more evidence.

That evening, I prepared a candlelit dinner myself and uncorked two of Adrian's most prized bottle of wine.

When Adrian returned home and saw me sitting quietly at the set table, he paused in surprise, then gave a knowing smile.

""Sophia, you should leave these things to Mrs. Anderson. You are the Luna of the Darkmoon Pack. Your only duty is to be pampered.""

He chuckled and pulled me into his embrace. We were so close that I could smell it,the sharp, cloying scent of a woman's perfume, bright roses and expensive musk.

I asked Adrian when he'd started wearing such a bold, heavy fragrance.

A flicker of guilt crossed his face. He sniffed his collar and quickly defended himself. ""Oh, the client I negotiated with today was a woman.Scents like this transfer easily, you know.""

Then, his tone shifted, turning accusatory. ""What, Sophia? Are you doubting me? Are you still upset about the checkup? I already explained. I thought you, of all people, would understand.""

A guilty conscience always betrays itself. I'd only asked a question, yet was met with a flood of blame.

Seeing my silence, Adrian changed the subject. He reached into his pocket and pulled out an exquisite emerald necklace, fastening it around my neck.

""Sophia, don't be angry. This is the gift I specially brought for you. One of a kind in the entire world. Unique. Do you like it?""

The emerald glowed with a deep green in the candlelight, truly beautiful. I traced its cool, smooth surface with my thumb.

Six years of being mated. Every time after a cold war, Adrian would gift me jewelry.

But what use were all the gems and gold in the world? They couldn't change the fact of his betrayal. They couldn't undo my daughter's murder.

Seeing a smile finally touch my lips, Adrian began to taste the meal I'd prepared. He praised my cooking lavishly.

Yet, in the end, he only took a few bites. After all, one who has already dined in secret has little appetite for a home-cooked meal.

Throughout dinner, I kept refilling Adrian's glass. He was soon drunk and passed out on the bed.

While he lay unconscious, I slipped into his study, searching for any evidence related to the plot that killed our daughter.

After rifling through his files, I found only one relevant document from six years ago, an organ transplant agreement.

In it, Adrian, using his status as my mate, had signed the organ transplant consent forms on my behalf.

So that was why he'd been in such a hurry to formalize our bond back then. It was never about me. It was to speed up Thea Allen's recovery.

I photographed the document carefully, returned it to its exact place,then attached the images and the drafted bond-dissolution papers into an single email.

I set it on a delayed send, timed to the moment my plane took off.

The moment the wheels left the ground, all these truths would land irrevocably in Adrian's inbox.

Chapter 4

The next morning, Adrian was the one who woke me.

Just like old times, he squeezed toothpaste onto my brush and even made a clumsy attempt at cooking breakfast.

As I brushed my teeth, he gently wrapped his arms around my waist from behind.

""Sophia, it was my fault. How could I let you go to such an important prenatal checkup alone? Let me go with you today, okay?""

Before I could even respond, he ruffled my hair, his smile boyish and shy.

Watching his figure move busily in the kitchen, a wave of biterness washed over me.

Adrian, you were always so hot and cold.

After six years, it suddenly hit me,I don't think I ever truly knew you.

Never mind. I don't love you anymore. From now on, I have no need to understand you.

When Adrian and I arrived at the hospital, Thea Allen was there too.

She was there for a dermatology appointment.

As a hugely popular actress, Thea was mobbed by fans wherever she went.

From a distance, I could hear their chatter,

""Poor Thea, just recovered from that serious illness a couple of years ago, and now she's back at the hospital.""

""Don't worry, she'll be fine. This is the top hospital in the city.""

""And the majority shareholder of this hospital is Alpha Adrian of the Darkmoon Pack. He's practically her rumored boyfriend. He'll definitely use all his resources to protect her.""

""Wow, a top star and an Alpha CEO? Sounds like a perfect match.""

The next moment, Thea's gaze scanned the crowd and locked onto Adrian. She called his name.

All the fans turned to look at us.

Thea jogged over and latched onto Adrian’s arm with intimate familiarity.

""Alpha Adrian, it's all your fault for insisting on that king crab yesterday! You made me break out in hives. So, you came here today just for me, right? I guess I'll have to forgive you, then.""

Adrian looked at me, then at Thea. Finally, he smiled and nodded at her.

The fans around us wore expressions of pure delight, savoring the scene.

I knew it. Adrian was going to abandon me here, again.

I stared straight into his face, enunciating each word clearly. ""Adrian, you said you were coming with me for my checkup.""

The bystanders' expressions shifted again, this time to shock at a new scandal.

A flicker of something remorse crossed Adrian's eyes. He started to take a step toward me, but Thea pulled him back.

The look Thea shot me then had none of its earlier sweetness. It was sharp and triumphant.

""Alpha Adrian, isn't she just your live-in housekeeper? Bringing her to the hospital is charity enough. No need to actually accompany her to the appointment.""

""If word got out, people might think the baby was yours. That would really damage your reputation, and the Pack's.""

Hearing Thea's words, the onlookers seemed to have an 'aha' moment. The looks they threw my way were now filled with utter contempt.

Adrian's lips moved, but in the end, he didn't utter a single word in my defense. He simply let Thea lead him away.

Leaving me standing there alone, utterly abandoned.

Chapter 5

It didn't take long. A fan's video of our encounter went viral, shooting straight to the top of the trending charts.

The online comments cut like a knife,

""Looks like the Alpha isn't just wealthy, he's genuinely kind and upright.He even takes such good care of his housekeeper.""

""Told you so. Alpha Adrian would never be interested in woman like her.""

""Did you see that old hag trying to copy Thea by wearing an emerald necklace too? Pathetic.""

""That emerald necklace is our company's new flagship piece. One of a kind in the world. The Alpha instructed me to deliver it to Thea's home personally.""

""How romantic! Gifts that are utterly unique. Thea is so lucky.""

I closed the comment section. Lying on the surgical table, staring at the ceiling tiles, a wave of dizziness came over me.

The pack doctor asked me one more time, his voice low,""Luna, are you absolutely certain you wish to terminate this pregnancy?""

I closed my eyes and nodded firmly, without hesitation.

They administered a strong anesthetic, yet the pain lingered,a deep, bone-gnawing agony. The tears I'd held back for so long finally spilled over.

After the procedure, I instructed the doctor to preserve the fetal remains.Only to deliver them to Adrian only after I was gone.

Stepping out of the hospital doors, I hailed a cab straight to the airport.

When I opened my phone, a link from a close friend popped up,a livestream.

It was Adrian, attending an awards ceremony as Thea's plus-one.

On stage, Thea wore a strapless evening gown. Adrian stood beside her, dressed in a tailored suit of a perfectly matching hue.

While Thea gave her speech, the camera kept cutting to Adrian. His face was beammed with pride as he watched her.

His gaze was fiery, filled with indescribable admiration and devotion.

The host, playing to the crowd, teased Thea into describing her relationship with Adrian in just two words.

Thea smile shyly, tilting her face toward Adrian's adoring look.

""Fated mate.""

A sudden, hollow laugh escaped me. When Adrian and I had formed our mating bond, he had sworn to my face that I would be his one and only fated mate.

I shut off the livestream. I wanted no more to do with their spectacle.

The plane was preparing for takeoff.

One minute before turning off my phone, messages from Adrian flooded in.

""Don't take Thea's words to heart. She's just a childish girl. She didn't mean it.""

""Are you still at the hospital? Let me finish this meeting, and I'll come pick you up myself, okay?""

""Sophia, don't sulk. It's not good for your health, or the baby's.""

When I didn't reply, he even tried calling several times.

I ignored it all and turned off the phone.

Even now, Adrian was lying to me. He was clearly at a ceremony with Thea, not in any meeting.

Meanwhile, backstage, Adrian waited for Thea, finally remembering his pregnant wife in a moment of idle concern. But neither messages nor calls could reach me.

Until his Beta sent a text.

 * Fix: A new $2–$5 ""Basic"" tier is coming soon for locked regions. No more $30 ""Ultra"" prices!

⚡ Token-Saving Hacks
If u can still get in, use ""Programmer Mode"" to stretch ur limit:
 * The Memory Trick: Don't write stories. Use bullet points like [Traits: Stoic, Grumpy] or [Likes: Coffee]. Saves 70% of tokens.
 * The Reset: After 20–30 msgs, copy the last plot point, delete the chat, and start fresh. Long histories = huge token bills.
 * Keep it Short: Set bot responses to 50–100 tokens and keep ur own msgs brief.
 * No VPNs: They’ll shadowban u for spoofing ur region. Just wait for the cheap tier.

Here’s the deal on why Chai is currently in ""Survival Mode"" and how you can actually beat the system. As of February 19, 2026, the app is fighting off bankruptcy because keeping the ""brains"" of the bots alive costs about $50,000 every single day!👇

1. The 2026 Region Lock & ""Basic Tier""
Chai recently blocked free access in certain countries because the ad money there was too low to cover the electricity bills.
 * Locked Regions: India, Pakistan, Philippines, Bangladesh, Egypt, and parts of SE Asia/Africa.
 * The Solution: Devs are launching a $2–$5 ""Basic Tier"" soon. It’s a cheap, ad-supported plan designed specifically for users who can't afford the $30 ""Ultra"" price but want to bypass the regional blocks.
 * VPN Warning: Don't use a VPN. Chai's new 2026 detection is aggressive and will likely shadowban your account (giving you infinite loading screens).

2. The ""Token-Saver"" Guide
To stay under your daily message limit, you have to switch from ""storyteller"" to ""programmer mode."" AI re-reads everything you’ve said every time you reply, which is what eats your tokens.

| Action | Token-Heavy (Avoid ❌) | Token-Light (Do This ✅) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Memory** | Long, poetic paragraphs | Short, bulleted traits |
| **Chat History** | Keeping 100+ msgs | Deleting & restarting chats |
| **Response Size** | ""Long"" or ""Novella"" | ""Short"" or ""Standard"" |
| **Backstory** | Flowery prose | Tag-based ""Identity Blocks"" |

3. The Bullet-Trait Method
Instead of writing a long story, use ""tags."" This saves about 70% of your tokens instantly.
 * Old (Heavy): ""Kaelen is a grumpy knight who fought in the Great War. He has a scar over his eye and hates people."" (50+ tokens)
 * New (Efficient): * [Identity: Knight, Veteran]
   * [Traits: Grumpy, Blunt, Loyal]
   * [Physical: Eye-scar, Rugged]
   * [Likes: Silence, Ale] (20 tokens)

4. The ""Fresh Start"" Reset
This is the #1 way to save tokens. After 20–30 messages, your history becomes a ""token monster.""
 * The Fix: Copy the last important thing that happened, delete the chat, and start a new one. Paste that event as your first message. This resets the ""bill"" back to zero.

The Bottom Line;
Chai isn't trying to be greedy; they’re trying not to shut down. The high prices and blocks are a ""cross-subsidy""—paying users are basically keeping the lights on for everyone else.",2,1771438591.0,Chai_Unofficial,5,0.75,False

1r8aofb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ImprovingEyesight/comments/1r8aofb/my_eyesight_recently_improved_here_is_what_i_did/,"My eyesight recently improved, here is what I did","I am here to give hope. My eyesight was gradually getting worse for over 15 years. I never experienced any longer-term improvement, was only getting worse. I got never diagnosed, it came with age. First I just made all browser texts bigger, because it was easier on eyes. Then noticed differences between vision in one eye compared to the other. Both eyes continued slow deterioration even though I took quite a lot of supplements (not just for eyes) and had healthy nourishment in general.  Then I had to turn on a lot of light to read normal text on paper, 5 years ago. Then, after a year or two even that didn't help. Distance eye sight was almost ok, but in last year it also got a tiny bit worse. I was never diagnosed, I am just not the go-to-doctor type. I thought this came with age (late 40s now).

Then I found glasses no one wanted. Tried them, they were quite strong reading glasses. I didn't see with them into distance but I could read very small letters. Or watch youtube when someone put small text into video. That was 2 years ago. Then I got gifted another glasees which were a bit less powerful in magnifying but improved even my long-distance sight when on. That's how I knew my eyes were f\*\*ked.

But just recently, something changed. My eyesight improved dramatically! I can now see details and clarity in videos. I can write youtube posts in that small font without glasses! I can do programming without glasses! And it's super recent, I remember everything!! Here is what I wrote on youtube about these changes and how I improved my eye sight:

(3 days ago) My eyesight recently improved, it's kind difficult to explain how because I take many things. But most recently, just before it improved, I have started to put into my daily coffee at 3 PM following new things: eight to quarter teaspoon **niacinamide** powder,  lutein in **marigold extract** about eight of a teaspoon and  **alantoin** about quarter of teaspoon. These three things. I also take many other things from before but only after adding this to my daily regimen I have *seen* \[sic\] the change. Even now, I can read this as I write it, it was not normal before. Of course, when I get tired, my eyesight gets a bit worse. But I can now focus better than before.

Possibly also 1g of potassium **ascorbate**; it's a lot of ascorbate (vitamin c), in the form of potassium ascorbate, form probably doesn't matter.. Could also be *zeaxanthin* in the same marigold extract as the lutein is in. It is indeed powerful eye nutrient.

I was also **sunning** a few times during last month. I have discovered it independently a few months ago. Didn't even know it's called ""sunning"" and that it's a thing just until 3 days ago. It's really nice to do during sunny winter afternoons and evenings since sun is really low in winter.   
  
(today) this is literally a ""holy sht"" moment for me. I woke up in the morning and my vision was ok, pretty much mediocre. I tried to focus on distant objects from my bedroom's window (on horizont), I do this last 6 months, nothing special. Then I got my coffee and breakfast. I started watching youtube, reading on computer a little, same ol'. Still didn't feel all that different. Then I looked out from the window and literally went ""Holy sh."" a few times! Not only I can see this text in a totally clear way (it was near-impossible to see it clearly before) but looking from that window at the house I like to look at to train my vision, I could see its features completely clearly. As if I had glasses on. As if I looked at it through looking glass. Unbelievable. Yesterday I was sunning at about this time, will do it again today. But it's not just sunning, it must be all the supplements. I most recently aded alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), quite a large dose, 2 days ago. 

And another small addendum: the text on youtube now looks like magnified, as if I increased page size to 120%. I keep checking it in the browser, but no, the page size is the same (100%). It feels like youtube changed the font size. I am WTFing on this so hard!

So there you have it. My eyesight improved and it's a small miracle. Now that I know how it works, I will continue taking stuff and will also throw kitchen sink at it too. Guys, I am a ""supplement junkie"", ok? I take a lot of things, melatonin, creatine, etc etc. But nothing helped before, I was consistently getting worse! I also drink a 2l Coke every day, btw. 

This post is real and it is not an ad. I could post links to products for Europeans since it may not be easy to find marigold extract online for people. If anyone is interested, I will only post the info in a reply and not as links.",1,1771438540.0,ImprovingEyesight,0,0.6,False

1r8alaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernDatingDoneRight/comments/1r8alaf/what_actually_makes_someone_worth_getting_back/,What ACTUALLY Makes Someone Worth Getting Back With: The Psychology That'll Save You Years,"so i spent way too much time researching breakups, ex dynamics, and relationship psychology because honestly? i kept seeing friends (and myself tbh) make the same mistakes over and over. read through psychology research, listened to relationship experts like Esther Perel and Matthew Hussey, dove into attachment theory... the whole deal. and what i found was kinda eye opening.



most of us don't actually want our ex back. we want the validation back. the comfort. the identity we had when we were with them. but that's completely different from wanting the actual relationship we had. and understanding that difference? game changer.



\## the real reasons we want them back (and why they're BS)



\*\*you're just lonely or bored\*\*

if you're thinking about your ex primarily when you're alone on friday nights or scrolling through couples on instagram, that's not love. that's discomfort with being single. huge difference. loneliness makes us romanticize the past and forget why things ended. your brain literally rewrites history to make the relationship seem better than it was. it's called rosy retrospection and it's incredibly common.



\*\*you want to ""win"" the breakup\*\*

this one's subtle but toxic af. if you're motivated by proving you're worthy, showing them what they lost, or getting closure through reunion... you're chasing ego validation, not love. real relationships aren't about winning. they're about partnership. if your primary motivation involves proving something, you're building on a foundation of insecurity.



\*\*you hate change and uncertainty\*\*

humans are wired to prefer familiar pain over unfamiliar potential. we'd rather go back to a mediocre relationship we know than face the uncertainty of being single or finding someone new. this is called the ""certainty trap"" in behavioral psychology. you're not missing them, you're missing predictability.



Check out ""Attached"" by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller. this book breaks down attachment theory in relationships and explains why some people get stuck in cycles of wanting exes back. it's basically required reading if you keep falling into the same patterns. helped me understand why i kept gravitating toward emotionally unavailable people. legitimately changed how i approach relationships.



\## when it actually makes sense to try again



\*\*the core issues that caused the breakup are genuinely resolved\*\*

not ""we'll work on it"", not ""it'll be different this time."" actually resolved. like if you broke up because of long distance and now you live in the same city. or one person wasn't ready for commitment and genuinely did the internal work to change that. vague promises don't count. concrete changes do.



timing matters here. Matthew Hussey talks about this a lot in his work. sometimes people really do need to grow separately before they can be healthy together. but growth has to be real and demonstrable, not just claimed.



\*\*both people have grown independently\*\*

key word: independently. if you've both spent time becoming fuller versions of yourselves apart, you might actually have something new to build. but if either person just waited around or used the breakup as motivation to ""get them back""... that's not growth, that's desperation with a glow up.



real growth looks like: developing new interests, going to therapy, building stronger friendships, becoming comfortable alone, addressing the behaviors that contributed to the breakup.



\*\*the relationship had genuine compatibility, just bad circumstances\*\*

like you were both stressed from external factors (death in family, job loss, mental health crisis) and took it out on each other. or you were too young and immature but the foundation was solid. circumstances can change. fundamental incompatibility doesn't.



Try the app Paired for relationship insights and exercises. even if you're not together, it has great modules on understanding relationship patterns and what healthy partnerships actually look like. helps you get clearer on whether your past relationship had real substance or just intensity.



There's also BeFreed, an AI learning app that pulls from books, research papers, and expert talks to create personalized audio content. You can ask it to help you understand relationship patterns or attachment styles, and it builds a learning plan around your specific situation. 



The voice options are actually addictive, like you can pick a smoky, sarcastic tone or something more calming. It's useful during commutes or workouts when you want to work through these patterns but don't have time to sit and read. The adaptive learning plan adjusts based on what resonates with you.



\## the questions that tell you everything



\*\*would you want this person if they were a stranger you just met?\*\*

strip away the history, the memories, the time invested. if this exact person with these exact qualities walked up to you at a coffee shop today, would you be interested? or are you only interested because of sunk cost fallacy?



\*\*can you list specific reasons why they're right for you beyond ""i love them""?\*\*

love isn't enough. do your values align? do they treat you with consistent respect? do they support your growth? do they communicate well? can you be fully yourself around them? if you can't articulate concrete reasons beyond feelings, that's a red flag.



\*\*are you willing to accept them exactly as they are right now?\*\*

not their potential. not who they could be if they just changed xyz. exactly who they are today. because betting on potential is a losing game. people only change when they want to, not because you want them to.



\## what actually matters



the thing is, most relationships end for good reasons. yeah it hurts, yeah you miss them, yeah there were good times. but good times don't erase fundamental problems. and missing someone doesn't mean being with them is the right choice.



Getting Past Your Breakup by Susan Elliott is weirdly comprehensive for understanding post breakup psychology. covers everything from the neurochemistry of heartbreak to practical steps for moving forward. i expected it to be generic advice but it actually digs into why we get stuck in loops of wanting exes back and how to break those patterns.



the brutal truth? if you're constantly questioning whether you should reach out, if you're looking for signs they want you back, if you're checking their social media obsessively... you probably already know the answer. healthy relationships don't require this much mental gymnastics. they feel right, even when they're hard.



sometimes the kindest thing you can do for yourself is accept that what you had was meaningful AND is over. both things can be true. you can love someone and still choose not to be with them. that's not failure, that's wisdom.



and maybe, just maybe, the energy you're spending trying to revive something dead could be better spent building something new. either with someone else or with yourself. both options are infinitely better than trying to force a relationship that already proved it doesn't work.",1,1771438352.0,ModernDatingDoneRight,0,1.0,False

It's torture to see you so frequently, and not be able to speak the deepest truths of my heart. I only speak the words that I feel would be rejected or unwelcome, on this platform. Ive written so many of my thoughts to share with you because I knew you didnt want me to reach out.. 
I never expected you to become a part of my weekly existence again.
This must be a karmic joke. 

I want to speak to you directly and share the pain I feel I want to apologizefor the scars I left you with. But all we have space for is surface level in the public eye.

I cant tell you how alone I feel without you and how I feel like I gave up the most beautiful love story of my life when I left. I cant tell you how the color left my dreams and the air left my lungs. 
Or about the panic attacks that washed over me for almost a year following the severing of our bond. 

Or about why I think I pushed you away. 
The pattern recognition of self sabotage- because I didn't want someone to tell me how to live my life, even if it was probably what was best for me. Or about the fact that I only spoke to someone outside of our relationship, because the way you loomed, and worried pushed my buttons that had been broken by unhealthy parental relations. My biggest regret.

Just fyi, Im pretty sure polyamory is not the right speed for me either, I have thought about it a lot since we split and what the appeals are. The appeal is always tied to the women, I just dont seem to experience the same depth of emotions with men- they all seem so stunted and blind and dense. Although, I think I relate to them in that stunted feeling more than anything. 
Bros. 

And just so you know, I STILL haven't slept with the 1 person you seemed to worry about the most. And I truly never had the desire to since I split with him so many years ago, either. He really is the only friend I had back then that I felt was looking out for me, and he helped me when I was struggling to tread the waters and waves of life. And you may be right about his intentions but I know and trust mine. 

I just need/ed a fucking friend, I cut about all of mine out when we were together, and I couldn't help but live in the frustration and resentment of that. But now? I'd give up everyone to be with you. 
Id betray myself in that principle I stood on because I recognize you would never betray my trust as  I did yours. I would give you all my passwords, all my paychecks, all my heart. 


I loved you, your mind, your body, your heart. I didn't need more physically from you, I just needed permission to be me and take care of my needs without shame. I didnt mean to make you feel emotionally cut off when it came to intimacy. I was and still am working out something broken in me that makes it hard to make eye contact and feel safe, without being distracted- but I never closed my eyes because I dont enjoy staring into your baby blues. In fact I think Id very much like you to look at me and hold me again so I could feel the release that comes with a deep sense of safety that you brought to me. 

I would fully surrender in your arms and feel safe in the embrace of home.

It seems that Epstien was using a MindSpring/Citrix server for communications prior to 2008 or so. Keep in mind the government likes to use Citrix to control classified information. 

https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00079502.pdf

Analysis: The Mindspring System in Epstein's Operations

Based on my investigation of the Epstein document collection, I've uncovered significant details about the Mindspring system - a private communication network used by Jeffrey Epstein and his associates before the widespread adoption of email.

What Was Mindspring?

The Mindspring system was a private server-based messaging system set up specifically for Epstein's household and operations. According to testimony from Juan Alessi (Epstein's house manager from approximately 1990-2002), it functioned as follows:

Technical Setup: The system was a server that connected Epstein's properties, allowing messages to be sent between the New York office and various houses. It was not email in the modern sense - it was a proprietary messaging system.

How It Worked:

Messages were typed on computers in the New York office

The system would send messages to computers at Epstein's properties

A notification would appear saying ""Hey, you've got mail"" 

Messages were printed and faxed to the house every 2-3 hours, then hand-delivered to Epstein 

Who Set It Up: 

The system was created by Mark Lumber (sometimes spelled ""Mark Lumber""), a computer specialist who worked exclusively for Epstein. He was based in New York but traveled to Palm Beach to set up the system at Epstein's house. 

Timeframe and Usage

The Mindspring system was implemented toward the end of Alessi's employment (which ended in December 2002). 

Alessi testified that he ""didn't get involved with that too much"" because it was ""the very end of my stay""

 This places the system's implementation in the early 2000s, likely around 2001-2002.

Email Addresses vs. Private System

There's an important distinction to make:

Mindspring.com email addresses: These were regular email accounts (like gmax1@mindspring.com used by Ghislaine Maxwell) that existed alongside the private system 

The Mindspring server system: This was Epstein's private internal messaging network that operated separately from public email services

Integration with Other Systems

The documents reveal that Epstein's technical setup was sophisticated:

The Mindspring system was connected to Citrix programs that linked various computers \\\[\\\]

This allowed for secure communication within what was referred to as ""the organization"" \\\[\\\]

The system enabled monitoring and sharing between computers within Epstein's network

Significance for Investigations

The Mindspring system represents a significant gap in the documentary record:

Pre-Email Communications: Since the system predated widespread email use in Epstein's operations, it means that communications from the 1990s and early 2000s may not be captured in the email collections released through FOIA.

Private Network: 

As a proprietary system, it would have been more difficult for investigators to access compared to standard email services.

Potential Evidence Gap: 

Alessi's testimony that messages were printed and faxed suggests there may have been physical copies of these communications, but it's unclear if any were preserved.

What's Missing from the Record

Despite finding references to the Mindspring system, I found no actual Mindspring messages or communications in the document collection. The system appears to have been:

Used for daily operational communications (even trivial messages like ""Jeffrey wants a cup of coffee"") 

A key part of Epstein's household management in the early 2000s

Potentially containing communications that would fill gaps in the timeline of Epstein's activities

Connection to Earlier Questions

This finding helps explain why we found no pre-9/11 and little pre 2008 Saudi communications in the email collections - the Mindspring system was the primary communication method during that period, and those communications may not have been preserved or released.",21,1771438115.0,Epstein,3,1.0,False

Analysis: The Mindspring System in Epstein's Operations

Based on my investigation of the Epstein document collection, I've uncovered significant details about the Mindspring system - a private communication network used by Jeffrey Epstein and his associates before the widespread adoption of email.

What Was Mindspring?

The Mindspring system was a private server-based messaging system set up specifically for Epstein's household and operations. According to testimony from Juan Alessi (Epstein's house manager from approximately 1990-2002), it functioned as follows:

Technical Setup: The system was a server that connected Epstein's properties, allowing messages to be sent between the New York office and various houses. It was not email in the modern sense - it was a proprietary messaging system.

How It Worked:

Messages were typed on computers in the New York office

The system would send messages to computers at Epstein's properties

A notification would appear saying ""Hey, you've got mail"" 

Messages were printed and faxed to the house every 2-3 hours, then hand-delivered to Epstein 

Who Set It Up: 

The system was created by Mark Lumber (sometimes spelled ""Mark Lumber""), a computer specialist who worked exclusively for Epstein. He was based in New York but traveled to Palm Beach to set up the system at Epstein's house. 

Timeframe and Usage

The Mindspring system was implemented toward the end of Alessi's employment (which ended in December 2002). 

Alessi testified that he ""didn't get involved with that too much"" because it was ""the very end of my stay""

 This places the system's implementation in the early 2000s, likely around 2001-2002.

One person said if I really want to make the feature happen, I need to basically shift from ""wait for a producer to say yes"" to ""start rallying the troops and say you're filming in Q1 2027."" 

He went on about getting director avails, using that correspondence to tell other producers ""I'm talking to so-and-so director and actor,"" making pitch decks, etc.

Basically, I guess ""pretending"" that the film's happening instead of sitting around for a producer to start taking action.

It feels a little car salesman, but he also said it's how so many indie features end up getting made.

1r8aen5,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1r8aen5/my_friends_roommate_put_up_cameras_without_her/,My friends roommate put up cameras without her consent,"TL;DR: My friend’s roommate is paranoid and verbally harassing her. She put up cameras without my friend’s consent because she thinks she’s stealing from her. Is there anything she can do?

One of my very close friends recently(Oct 2025) moved into the apartment above me with someone she met online. She met this girl a couple of times before deciding to move in with her. All seemed fine. Upon moving in things started to go south. The issue that sparked the tension was her roommate wanting to get a really nice portable washer and dryer for their apartment and my friend being concerned about the cost, space, and landlord approval. Ultimately the landlord said no which caused her roommate to get mad at her for involving the landlord. This then caused tension and the roommate said she wasn’t going to split any apartment things(furniture and such) and wasn’t going to share anything. Things smoothed out a bit with some disagreements here and there. My friend is a very calm person who isn’t much for conflict. My friend was gone on a trip for the last two months and got back about a week ago and since then things have escalated quickly. Her roommate is moving her things around, claiming she’s stealing from her, yelling at her and in her face.

Recently my friend hung a pair of oven mitts on the fridge and moved her roommates oven mitts slightly to the left to make room. Her roommate then got mad and started throwing the magnets on the table.

Later my friend asked her to send her portion of the electric bill which her roommate then got angry and started yelling at her and getting in her face, my friend was able to record this argument.

The next day my friend found out that she had put cameras in the apartment without her consent and had apparently recorded my friend yelling at her and stealing from her, all untrue. Since finding out there are cameras my friend feels unsafe and violated in her own home. She was making coffee the other day and talking to her mom out of site from the camera and her roommate came out of her room to watch her. Her roommate has since put a camera in the kitchen.

Her roommate is also claiming to be paranoid of me and my friends who live downstairs because my friend gave me a spare key to her apartment for emergencies. I had to go into their apartment a couple of times while my friend was away but NEVER let myself in. I always communicated with her roommate and only went into the apartment when it was convenient for her and she could let me in. She’s now saying she’s paranoid I could steal from her.

At this point she’s creating a very toxic living environment for my friend and since we all live in the same apartment building (building of four units btw) she’s created tension in the whole building. My friend wants to know if there’s anything she can do because talking to her doesn’t seem to do anything. She tried talking to the landlord but at this point there’s nothing he can really do. I’m honestly worried for this girls mental state at this point given her paranoia. There’s so much more I could say but this post is already a mile long so I’ll refrain.

Edit: forgot to point of that since they moved in in October and my friend was gone for two months they’ve only actually lived in the apartment together for a little over TWO months.",3,1771437949.0,badroommates,6,1.0,False

Dialling in espresso is a journey. It’s a delicate dance of grind size, dose, tamping, and timing, and if you’ve ever tried it, you know it’s just as much an emotional rollercoaster as it is a technical process. Here’s a look at the stages every espresso enthusiast experiences when dialling in that perfect shot.

# Stage 1: Optimistic Excitement

You’ve just got a new bag of beans, your grinder is freshly cleaned, and your espresso machine is gleaming. “This is it,” you tell yourself. “This shot is going to be perfect.” Your excitement is almost tangible, and you might even do a little happy dance before the first grind.

# Stage 2: Confused Curiosity

You pull your first shot and… it tastes wrong. Too sour? Too bitter? Too watery? Suddenly, the language of espresso, extraction, bloom, yield, ratio, feels like a foreign code you have to decipher. You adjust the grind and dose and try again, wondering why this feels more like chemistry than coffee.

# Stage 3: Mild Frustration

After a few attempts, the shots still aren’t right. Maybe it’s under-extracted, or maybe you went too far the other way. Your friends or family ask if you’re okay, and you mutter something about “dialling in” while trying to ignore the tiny panic creeping in.

# Stage 4: Determined Experimentation

Now it’s serious. You’re measuring doses, weighing yield, timing shots down to the second. You tweak the grind, adjust the tamp, maybe even check the roasted date again. This is your lab. Precision is your goal, and failure is just another step toward learning.

# Stage 5: Glimmers of Hope

Finally, a shot comes out that’s close. The flavour is balanced, the crema looks good, and your excitement bubbles up again. You pull another, hoping it wasn’t just a fluke, and for the first time in a while, your taste buds are smiling.

# Stage 6: Obsessive Refinement

One perfect shot is never enough. You tweak slightly here, a fraction finer there. You experiment with temperature, pre-infusion, and extraction time. Each shot teaches you something new, and every small improvement feels like a victory.

# Stage 7: Blissful Satisfaction

At last, the perfect shot. Balanced, rich, flavourful, and just the right texture. You savour it slowly, maybe even close your eyes for a moment. Hours of trial, error, and tiny adjustments have led to this one cup. And while you know tomorrow you’ll probably start dialling in again with a new bag, this moment is pure espresso bliss.

It just seems odd to me that she’s constantly talking about being nauseous, having digestive issues, and not feeling well. And blaming food poisoning. We have all noticed this uptick in her barely eating now and just consuming mostly drinks, liquids and coffees. That stood out to me a lot. And the fact that she has ondansetron (Zofran) on hand is very sus too. Like most people I know only have that if they’re pregnant or dealing with something like Ozempic-related nausea. It’s a prescription based anti-nausea medication. And Jesse talking about how she can’t poop (also Ozempic related). 

Im also pretty sure her mom started it a while back. Remember when she kept saying her mom couldn’t help because she was “starting a health journey” and some guessed that it could be a GLP-1 thing. 

I’m not saying this is definitely what’s going on, but it doesn’t feel completely out of the realm of possibility, especially given how focused she’s become on her appearance, weight, and counting calories lately.

Ugh, what a basic induction! This cold is getting to my head.

He said it was coffee,  reheated in a microwave

A microwave oven! A genuine microwave oven! I thanked all that was good that these primals had such uncharacteristicly advanced technology, that they had understanding enough of electromagnetic waves to have microwaves in their domiciles.

I promptly (and carefully ) asked if I could see the device; he eagerly agreed, brought me to his ‘kitchen’ and pointed out the metal and glass box sat neatly on his countertop. 

He tapped at the microwave in demonstration, it made pleasing beeping noises when he did.

He asked me if I wanted to heat something up, he told me which of produce he had could and couldn’t be put inside… for some reason. I made a note of it though, no ‘forks’, no eggs, no ‘peppers’ 

He put his coffee back in for 30 seconds, the new time unit I was getting used to, and he took it out just before the timer reached 0. I was very pleased to find that primals had a concept of zero, and had had one for around 1500 years according to the ai on their search engine. 
This planet was really exceeding expectations 

He popped open the door and took out the hotter coffee

“Neat huh?”

“Indeed it is, huh”

“Huh?”

I nodded* to myself, proud of having swiftly adopting the new grammatical particle. 

“Please can I use it now?” I asked it 

“Go ahead” it said, and stepped away from the microwave for me.

I pressed the same button he had used and listened to it hum, I placed my manipulators against it, and waited for the heat to conduct… I couldn’t feel anything yet but it stood to reason th-

“You won’t warm ya self up like that” it said with a playful scoff. Finley walked over to another area of the counter, dials were installed on the side and the top surface was covered in Crossing black metal bars

Just wanted to say a small thank you to this community.

When I first shared the site here almost a year ago, the idea was simple — a neutral place to explore Indian specialty coffee and log what people are actually drinking. No ads, no rankings, no “best of”.

Over the last \~45 days, something encouraging happened:

The community crossed 100+ coffee ratings.

It’s still very early, and honestly, too small to draw any meaningful taste trends yet.

But what’s been nice to see is the behaviour:

* People are actually contributing, not just browsing
* Many rate multiple coffees in one session
* Most start anonymously and create an account later
* A few people have started building public profiles to track their coffees and setups

Right now it covers \~78 Indian roasters and \~900 coffees, with about \~450 users in the last month.

Still small — but it finally feels like the platform is starting to come alive.

If you’ve rated something or shared feedback earlier, thank you. A lot of the early direction came from this sub.

If anyone’s curious, the site is here:  
[https://www.indiancoffeebeans.com](https://www.indiancoffeebeans.com)

Would genuinely love input from this community:

* What would make you log your coffees regularly?
* Would you care about a public coffee profile?
* Anything missing or annoying?

The long-term goal is to build a community-driven taste map of Indian coffee.

Appreciate all the support from r/IndiaCoffee so far.

I have always been a bit of an introverted loner, but these last few months have made me realise that I am no longer just mostly alone, but that I’m actually lonely.

I’m not picky about how, whether it be real-life friends, virtual friends, texting buddies; I’m open for pretty much anything!

Let’s share photo’s of the world around us, and about our place in that world. I like to think of myself as curious, open-minded and inclusive, so please, broaden my horizons!

You don’t have to be into the same stuff as me, but I’ll share a bit about myself just so that you know who you’d be talking to.

I am currently on Rybelsus 7mg in the morning - in attempt to curb appetite and Irbesartan 300mg. I lead an extremely sedentary lifestyle, terrible diet - lots of sweets and unhealthy stuff. I don’t drink, maybe 4-5 times a year socially, I don’t smoke, I don’t drink coffee but I do drink quite a bit of tea. Been on Rybelsus for 6 months, honestly weight wise it hasn’t really helped me lose weight (but also I don’t exercise or try and eat healthily) but I reckon it has helped me not put on more weight - if that makes sense. Irbesartan I’ve been on for 3 years or more, to help bring down my blood pressure. I have HBP. Haven’t had a blood test in 1.5 years, last one I had, glucose reading was 88mg/dL and HBA1C was 6.0. Had borderline gestational diabetes for first pregnancy and gestational diabetes officially diagnosed for second pregnancy.

About 8 months ago I had X-rays done and it showed my lower back discs are worn down. For certain reasons (mostly impacting future instance premiums), I know it sounds stupid, I am trying to not go see a doctor yet. In recent weeks, I occasionally feel a pins and needles sensation / slightly tingling sensation on my right feet. From where my toes are to just before my ankle. It doesn’t hurt at all, just a slight tingly sensation. It comes and goes a few times a day. Doesn’t impact walking or my life, but enough for me to realise this is something new my body is experiencing. This is exactly what I would tell a doctor if I saw one, just short of getting blood work. What is it? Thank you doctors!",1,1771437369.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

i scaled subreddit signals to about 3k mrr, but it did not feel like a single heroic launch. it was: ship a tiny thing, get one user, learn they hated onboarding, fix the stripe and clerk handoff, watch it crawl up, break something in a migration one tuesday night that stopped webhooks for three days, lose a couple trials, panic, sleep poorly, fix it, rinse. messy.

big mistakes that taught me patience. I chased feature parity with bigger products too early. I used expensive models for every query because they were easy, and watched costs spike. that led me to build a cost aware model mix, routing cheap embeddings and perplexity answers where good enough, and saving cash. I also overcomplicated pricing, and people just bounced at the clerk checkout. shifted to simpler plans, honest screenshots, and a small free tier for discovery. slow wins.

and the funny tiny tangent, i still write copy at 2am with cold coffee and a lamp on my desk, because the kids finally sleep. not productive, probably romanticizing the grind, but sometimes it actually helps clear ideas. sometimes i wonder if i should have stayed at the big job, or if i'm just stumbling into luck, or if i missed a faster path by being indecisive…

what stuck over all the noise is this. shipping consistently, accepting small ugly failures, and slow learning beats occasional big bets. pay attention to onboarding, keep an eye on model costs, and measure actual user behavior more than hype. also show screenshots, show real usage, not hypothetical workflows. those concrete things moved trials to paying customers more than any feature list.

curious how others pace themselves. do you plan compounding experiments over a year, or do big concentrated sprints? tbh i do a bit of both, but trying to be more patient lately, because the slow work compounds in weird ways. would love to hear real examples, not the tidy success posts.",1,1771437353.0,microsaas,3,1.0,False

**Blurb:**

**What does it take to turn your life around? Death, of course!** 

I died in this lame ass world of ours and woke up in a completely new one. I had a new name, a new face and a new body. This was my second chance to live a better life than the previous one. 

But goddamn it, why did I have to be a witch? Now I don't just have to be on the run from the Inquisition that wants to burn me and my friends. But I also have to earn a living? 

**Follow Elsa Grimly as she:** 

1. Makes new friends and tries to save them and herself from getting burned
2. Finds redemption from the deeds of her previous life
3. Tries to get along with a cat who (like most cats) believes she runs the world
4. Deals with other slice of life shenanigans.

**Chapter 103. Crafting with Danger**

After my deal with Mirabelle was sealed, I told her about the very first job I had for the fairies. “Here's a list of locations where the new buildings need to be built,” I said, handing her a piece of paper. “Buy whatever material is needed and have the check sent to me. I want you on this job right away. The taverns need to be ready in a week.” I also told her to reach out to Asmod after buying the materials. “He is the one designing layouts and floor plans. He will guide you where you need him. Also, no need to send away any new fairies who are coming in for work. I don’t mind having four helping hands instead of just two.”

“Got it, boss,” Mirabelle said with a playful salute.

I walked out of her office. I saw all the ‘vultures’ at the front dispersing away with their heads hung in despair. They probably received the news that the fairies had a fixed employer now.

I left the Merlin district and came back to Asmod's Nook. This time, neither of the dwarves snuck up on me. I found Asmod at his desk in the shop. “Now isn't this a pleasant surprise? You are sitting at the front like a proper shop owner.” I said playfully.

Asmod scoffed and hopped off his stool. “The reason I don't do that often is because I don't get enough free time to act like a regular businessman,” he said. “But I'm glad that it brightened your day a bit.”

I nodded and got to the reason why I was visiting him. “Are the charms prepared?” I said.

“I won't be surprised if they already are,” he said. “Myrtle is nothing short of a miracle worker. And she barely sleeps.” He grabbed his coat and we made our way out to his steam carriage.

“I don't think I've heard you being so impressed with someone,” I said.

“It's not very difficult to impress me, unlike Smokewell,” he said with a wink. “And dwarves are quite hardworking. But even among dwarves I haven't seen someone as obsessive as Myrtle. And to make things worse, she seems like a perfectionist.”

“What makes you say that?” I asked him as we got in his carriage and started driving.

“When I got her the materials from the black market she began fussing over the elemental impurities in the metals and their constitution and a dozen other parameters that went over my head.” Asmod shook his head and huffed. “She made me run to the black market and back for the exact materials she wanted three times.”

“For some reason I'm not surprised,” I said as I watched the buildings passing by. “Without her craftsmanship, the Iron Snakes would've been a bunch of small-time thugs and not a proper threat in Ironwatch.” I look at Asmod. “That reminds me, what do you think of her as an ally? Do you think you can trust her?”

He nodded without missing a beat. “She is one of us,” he said. “A bit skittish. A bit reserved. A very obsessive worker. But trustworthy. I had another craftsman review the materials she was nagging me to buy, to make sure it wasn't something she was cooking up to hurt us in some way. It wasn't. I know that might sound a bit paranoid of me, but I've seen some things in the hundred and ninety four years I've lived. I like to be sure of who I'm making friends with.”

“That's why I asked for your opinion,” I said. “I trust your judgement.”

“And I can trust Myrtle. She is one of us,” he said again.

We arrived at a little diner run by trolls.

It was a small building crouched at the corner like a brick-and-steel animal, its roof sagging under the weight of a dozen mismatched chimneys that puffed out smoke in confused intervals. A wooden sign hung above the door, carved with letters so deep they looked clawed rather than chiseled. It said: **The Stone Pot.**

The first thing I was greeted with on entering was the smell. A thick, savory haze of roasted meat, burnt sugar, and something earthy that lingered like damp moss. Inside, the booths were built low to the ground but wide enough for troll shoulders, each bench stitched together from hides that had definitely lived interesting lives. The troll cooks worked behind a counter reinforced with iron bands, moving with surprising grace as they flipped pans the size of shields and stirred cauldrons that burbled like mud pits. Plates clattered, customers shouted over each other, and the entire place hummed with a warm, chaotic energy that made it all feel oddly cozy.

The owner, a squat green haired, scale-skinned man with a horn jutting out of his head, gave Asmod a knowing smile and a nod as we walked in. Asmod returned the gesture before leading me to a room with the sign: Manager’s office.

There was a small trapdoor behind the manager's desk. We opened the door and descended down a flight of stairs leading underground. Other than the sound of our footsteps, I could hear shuffling and clatter of tools.

The stairs led to a room underground. It was well lit and the air smelled surprisingly clean. I was expecting a reek of chemicals and coal fire forges but there was none of that.

Myrtle was examining some sketches she had made. A cup of coffee sat forgotten by her hand on the desk. With her eyes still on the sketch, she reached for a pen. I lifted the cup out of her way before she could knock it over absentmindedly.

“Hello, Myrtle,” I said with a smile.

The dwarf girl perked up and looked at me. “Miss Grimly!” she blurted.

“I believe the charms are ready?” I said.

She nodded and waddled over to another desk in the corner. “Right here.” She picked up an amber colored rectangular object and held it towards me.

I took it from her and examined the thing. It was light in weight and could be flipped open like a compact mirror. On the inside was a glass screen, that was empty for now but would be filled with an abyss when it was time to use the thing. The other half of the charm was still smooth and plain but I knew what that empty space was for.

“This is where the hex will be carved, right?” I said.

Myrtle nodded, wringing her hands nervously. “Indeed. Once the charm is flipped close, it will be in contact with the screen that holds the abyss. Once the final condition is met, the hex will kill the abyss.”

I pulled out two bottles filled with a smokey black substance. “Let's test it, then,” I said. The abysses flew out of the bottles and stood with their heads bowed.

*“Master,”* they both greeted in subservience.

Myrtle raised a finger. “Um, there is one problem, however,” she said, eyeing the abysses nervously.

“What is it?” I said.

“The explanation for the problem is a bit complicated and may involve delving deeper into a subject you may not be familiar with,” she said.

I called the abysses back into the bottle and pulled over a foldable metal chair, sitting back. “Go ahead, make me smarter. I'm always ready to learn something new,” I said.

She pushed a short crate towards Asmod to sit on. Then she grabbed a notebook and pulled over a small footstool, sitting in front of us both. “As you might know, us dwarves are specialized in crafting,” she said.

“I didn't know that,” I said, making Myrtle pause. “Turns out I didn't know much about the kind of world I live in.”

“We do specialize in crafting,” Asmod said in a neutral tone. “Our entire society back home is built on the foundation of creating things from things that are available in nature. We aren't much of a warrior breed. We just like to make things out of things. Sometimes we even make things out of things that are of questionable origin,” he said.

I didn't quite understand the concept behind his last statement. And it seemed like that was the one Myrtle was going to explain. “Yes,” she said. “Sometimes, we create things from substances that nature didn’t mean for us mortals to play around with.”

“Like emotions,” Asmod said. “My entire set of capabilities are considered a taboo back in Morndarlock because it is a manipulative and deceitful art that I practice. In their opinion at least.”

“Yes,” Myrtle agreed again. “Mortals are supposed to express emotions, inspire them but not really trigger or twist them like Mr. Asmod's talent does. But it isn't really our choice in what we end up becoming good at. Multiple factors end up playing a role in what we become. Our ancestry, our environment, our bodies. This thing that dwarves are born with, is called ‘resonance’. It's our affinity towards one particular aspect of this world that we basically engineer in different ways to make a living.”

“Like humans do with their malice?” I said, tilting my head.

“Not exactly,” Asmod said. “Malice is more a product of an environment that humans grow up in. It's not as biological as resonance in us dwarves. I was just naturally born with a resonance for manipulation. As a child, I could write simple words in Mornish and it would provoke highly specific reactions in people who didn't know any better. I didn't gain that ability because I was raised in a certain society. I just had it.”

“Yes,” Myrtle said again, “And I resonated with the destruction aspect of nature. I can arrange mornish runes in a way that awakens different destructive properties in different materials. That's how I could create those bullets for Iron Snakes. That's also how I could calibrate the consistency of materials for that charm that you designed. So that your hex could be effective against an abyss.”

I nodded, taking it all in. “So what was the problem with the charm?” I said.

“Yes,” Myrtle said again. “So the thing is, an abyss is a substance that mortals aren't supposed to tinker with.”

I remained quiet. Asmod didn't say anything either. Even Myrtle paused as if we were all trying to gauge the gravity of the revelation.

I finally spoke up after a minute. “I'm actually not surprised. At the back of my mind, I did know that I was taking a risk of some kind.”

“Yes,” Myrtle said. “A very dangerous risk.” She flipped open the notebook and drew a straight line. She marked four different points on the scale.

The final diagram looked something like a number line but with only four values marking it. And they were marked with a name instead of a number.

“This is the Synthesis Scale used in Mornish Crafting,” she said. “Most crafting involves playing with materials and substances at the first two levels.” She tapped her pencil on the two levels at the left side of the line. “These are called the Live synthesis and the Concentrated Live synthesis levels. Here we synthesize pre-existing things to other things that do specific jobs. Most rune based weapons or poisons that dwarf alchemists create lie between these two levels.” Then she moved her pencil towards the right of the line. “But when you synthesize a material to this level, it is what gets the mornish alchemists arrested and executed. This level is called Infernal synthesis. Any material crafted on this level is capable of blowing up an entire city in one strike. But that’s still just a disaster.” She moved her pencil further right, to the last level. “This is where catastrophes happen. The Plague Synthesis level. Mornish alchemists who create materials on this level are considered divine threats. They can create weapons and illnesses that can wipe out entire continents in a week.”

I frowned deeply. “Are you implying that abysses lie on the Plague Synthesis level?” I said.

“No,” she said. Then she moved her pencil further right, beyond the end of the line. She drew a cross in the empty space. “The Abyss is here. It's the thing that lives after death. It goes against the natural order of things. Mortals are forbidden from tinkering with such things. Miss Grimly, your charm is capable of destroying an abyss entirely. I think there are dire consequences for a mortal who does something like that. Probably a fate worse than death.”

Texts included,"So this did not happen recently and I wanted to wait to ask about it just so I can observe her behaviour after 3 months towards me and compare it to before.

So she officially came to live with me July of 2025. We’ve been dating for a year. I have cameras outside my house so I can see when she leaves or not.

I’m not new to relationships and I vetted her A LOT before even agreeing to be in a relationship. From the day we first met through her cousin, she was a good friend and she started to like me and expressed her feelings towards me. I declined because I told her I want to first get to know her for a few months. Which I did.

We spent a few months together, I measured her friends, personality, and like how she is towards other guys as it’s important to me.

Out of the 5 girls I went on dates with before meeting her, she was the best one. So I finally accepted.

**How they exchanged contact info**

So then she moved in to my house. We’ve never had any problems. She wasn’t working for a few months and then she eventually found a new job.

At that job, there was a customer who frequented there as it’s a coffee place. So he always buys coffee and greets her. Typical regular customer.

So eventually she got fired from this place. They didn’t exchange contact so she didn’t have his contact.

Keep in mind, me and my girlfriend would always go to the gym but not always together. So one day he happens to go to the same gym and he sees her. He briefly asks how come she’s not at the shop anymore and she says she got fired. Between this conversation they somehow exchange phone numbers.

She came home and actually told me about him. She said a customer who would regularly come to her shop saw her at the gym. It wasn’t really information important to me.

# The messages

Okay so keep in mind I only discovered these messages AFTER she met with him once.

So it seems they were texting for 10 days. Honestly the most boring messages I’ve ever read.

Basically him asking her if she has relatives, and then she was wondering his age. She’s 23 and he is 40.

I was shocked to discover it was a much older guy.

# Key facts about messages

\- He never once complimented her

\- He never sent any photos

\- He never asked her to hang out / meet

\- He never flirted

\- No invitation to drink or a date

\- She doesn’t even go to bars, clubs, and she hates alcohol

\- She never complimented him, flirted, or tried to plan future dates to meet.

\- Both exchange of messages were very mundane and just plain. “What you doing”, “What’s for dinner”, “Working”, “At gym”, “With friends”

\- I mentioned before we don’t always go to the gym together. Even when she was going alone, she never ONCE tried to go to meet him at a different location but they also never saw each other at the gym again. She never lied about going to the gym those 2 weeks.

So here’s the real banger.

# The house visit

She asked him to meet twice but not planned. Basically if I said I was going out to hang out at my friend’s house then she would ask him if he wanted to hang out.

The first invite she made to him, he declined and said he was busy and said maybe next time.

Then she asked again a different time when I told her I’m going out with friends. It seems like she didn’t want to be alone or since I didn’t invite her, she decided to. She’s not from this country so she has no friends at all. This 40 year old male is the only friend she made.

This time he agreed and asked if she wanted to come to his house.

So I came back home early and I noticed she was gone. I didn’t message her because I wanted to keep it a surprise just incase she was up to no good.

# The confrontation at home

Keep in mind, I’ve never asked to check her phone and she had no knowledge that I would even ask.

When I came back, I asked where she was. She of course lied which is normal reaction if you go to someone’s house. She sent one last text message and placed her phone next to me.

So I said “Give me your phone or Your bags are going outside immediately.”

She then gave her phone.

The last message was him saying “Let me know when you get home.”

And then she said “I’m home.”

And then he said “Goodnight (her name)” nothing else.

I’m not sure about you but I use to be a play boy and anytime I would do something with the opposite sex and then go home, there would be a follow up message about the activity lol.

Anyways, I read the messages and it was exactly what I told you from messages section. Nothing special about it.

I asked her what they did and she said he ordered pizza and they just talked.

# Things to note about her

\- She’s honestly the most loving person ever. I’ve never been in a relationship with someone so caring. Before and after this situation; her behaviour never changed.

\- She’s always gives me a kiss before she leaves the house and doesn’t let me leave unless I do too

\- Never tries to hide me outside, around people, etc. she always needs to be wrapping around my arms and showing she cares

\- Constantly speaks about the future, kids, etc

\- Im her phone Lock Screen and have been for 1 year. She always feels so happy to change to a new one of us. Even till now she always tells me. It’s something so small but she’s just so happy about it.

\- She would tell me every time any anytime a guy hit on her or even spoke to her

\- NEVER ever tried to hide her phone. She always has her phone faced up, beside me; and never tried to hide messages. Even from this dude, I would be on her phone and I could see that he was messaging her.

I’ve been through her phone before. There’s literally nothing else in there in between any apps.

That’s a key part because when people try to cheat, they usually hide the evidence.

Even after the fact, I had his contact information and phone number and address. I told her I would simply wait till tomorrow and call him and ask him if I think she’s lying.

She legit said I can call him right now. Meaning that same moment she got back.

Anything I said to try to make it seem like she did sexual favours; she said I can keep the phone and pretend to be her and see.

I didn’t bother because I decided to trust her. Her behaviour has never changed once in the several months.

Anyways, I personally don’t think she did anything but what do you think?

I’m not sure if this is important but we live a pretty good life. We travel all the time, I treat her well, she treats me better than any past girlfriend.

She constantly posts me on social media, her last 10 posts is about me and our relationship. She tells all her co-workers about me. She’s basically just never given me a sign to not trust her. I’ve met her family, even slept over there.

Do you think she(23F) was interested in the (40M) or just wanted to make a friend ?

It doesn’t matter if it’s a house or car. I understand going to someone’s house doesn’t = cheating. It’s about what they do there.

When I was single, 99% of sexual stuff happened in cars. So it’s not so much the fact of location but rather just being with the opposite sex and what the text messages said.

So with this girl, we went on 3 dates before a first kiss and before anything more sexual. I respect it because I’m so use to either one nights.

Thanks. I’m asking this because I’m curious about others POV.

Update: (More Info)

We’ve spoke about this situation as a deep convo TWICE already and set new boundaries. As I also had a lot of female friends, I’ve agreed to stop communicating with them.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Actual episode:

The 8 chefs are currently in the dorms (Sebastian, William, Homer, Patrick, Hiroto, Amy, Karen, and Penelope) waiting to see who's going to be the final person who comes out of the doors that lead to the dorms. Adam opens the door and he says “you thought it was the end of me”. Homer gives an unenthusiastic yay. Adam says he knows that Homer isn't happy but he knows he doesn't give a shit. Penelope then says that she just realized that this means that Zara is gone. Amy begins to smile. 

There's a voice over that says “and now the continuation of Hell's Kitchen…”

Amy tells Penelope that she's so glad that the two mean girls are finally gone. Penelope says that she completely agrees with that. Penelope in a confessional says that Zara's attitude earlier today felt like she was a 6 year old stuck in a 26 year old's body and that the red team didn't need something like this whatsoever. In the dorms, Penelope says that she feels like they're going to be winning non-stop from now on. Amy says that she completely agrees with what Penelope is saying. William just says “we'll see”. William in a confessional says that although no longer having Zara is a good thing, he feels like the blue team overall is still a pretty strong team. In the dorms, Penelope tells William that he's being a party pooper, William just responds by saying that he knows that they're better without Zara but he feels like they're being way too confident. Penelope responds by telling William that he needs to stop being so negative. William just tells her that he's not being negative at all, he's just saying to not act overly confident. Hiroto in a confessional says that he's a bit concerned about the red team right now because they got rid of Zara and now they're going back to arguing like they never left. There's a shot of William walking away telling Penelope he's not really in the mood to get into an argument right now. Penelope says that she's not arguing with him at all. William responds to her by saying that she's making it seem like an argument.

After a bit of time has passed, over in an area that has a small couch near some wall, they show Sebastian and Patrick sitting down on the couch. Sebastian asks Patrick if he's going to be fine. Patrick says that he'll be fine, but he's pissed to see Adam come back through the dorms. Patrick in a confessional says that Adam acts like a whiny little bitch so he isn't happy to see him be around for a bit more. Sebastian just tells Patrick that he'll be fine and that he's pretty sure that Adam just was in a bad mood earlier because he didn't like to clean and that it'll all blow over tomorrow. Patrick says that he hopes that's the case. Sebastian in a confessional says that he understands that Adam and Patrick aren't necessarily that happy to be around each other but he's hoping that the two of them act like grown men and just get over it tomorrow.   
  
Sebastian asks Patrick if he wants some coffee or something to drink to relax him. Patrick just says that he's probably going to drink water instead since he feels like he isn't in the mood for coffee. Patrick then gets up from the couch to walk to the little kitchen to open the fridge to get some water. 

The intro with Ramsay slamming the knife onto the cutting board begins to play. The title of “Hell’s Kitchen” begins to show. This is followed by some flames to reveal the “Reno” part that’s displayed at the bottom of the “Hell’s Kitchen” logo.

The next morning arrives and the 9 remaining chefs all start to run their way into the dining room with Amy lagging behind because of her weight. When the final 9 all get into the dining room they're greeted with a dining room that has a large red velvet curtain tucked away in the far-right corner of where the dining room itself is. Meanwhile the dining room itself is filled with aisles of various foods in the kind of structure that matches a grocery store. Amy in a confessional says that she sees that the dining room literally looks like a grocery store and she thinks that they're going to be doing some kind of grocery store budget challenge and she feels like this is going to be the 2nd challenge in a row that the red team wins because she feels that the red team is going to be unstoppable now without Zara or Crystal dragging them down.   
  
Ramsay then looks at the 9 chefs and he tells them all “good morning”. The chefs all respond “good morning chef”. Ramsay says that he hopes that they noticed the dining room has shifted itself to look a lot more like a grocery store. Ramsay talks about how the grocery store is filled with so many ingredients that a chef would use every single day for both the actual kitchen and for cooking at home. Sebastian in a confessional says that he's a private chef and whenever people do hire them he has to frequently go to the grocery store to get the ingredients that they want for their food and that he's been to the grocery store so many times that he's pretty sure that all of the employees over there know who he is.  
  
Ramsay in the dining room then says that the grocery store sells many treats such as ice cream, cake, cookies. As Ramsay listed cookies, maître d’ Marino starts to walk into the dining room holding a plate of a large Gelatin cube. Ramsay then says that the most important thing is gelatin. Ramsay then talks about how gelatin comes in a massive variety of flavors. Then sous chefs Andrew and Jamie walk in with a cart filled with little cups of gelatin in various colors. Homer in a confessional says that he personally hasn't had gelatin in a long time but his daughter still loves it all of these years later so he isn't sure what the challenge is going to be.   
  
There’s a shot of Marino placing down the cube of gelatin in the same cart as the gelatin cups. Ramsay then asks Marino the question of what is he doing with that gelatin. Marino says that he's just placing it down. Ramsay then jokingly says that there's way too much clutter and for him to take it back. Marino just grabs the gelatin and walks away with it. Then it cuts to the chefs just having to eat the small cups that have the gelatin in them. Adam in a confessional says that it feels like he's in elementary school and that it's really embarrassing to be eating something that he thinks is only for kids.   
  
Ramsay then asks Karen what did she taste with the gelatin that she ate. Karen responds by saying that it tasted like lime. Ramsay then looks at Hiroto and asks him what did he think it tasted like. Hiroto says that the thing that he ate tasted like cherries. Ramsay then says that he feels like this is important to ask because now they're going to be doing the challenge that they do every single year. There's a quick shot of Patrick smiling. The velvet curtains slide upwards to reveal a chair with some kind of wall behind the chair that looks like some kind of background for an aisle in a grocery store. 

Ramsay says that they're going to do the one challenge that they do in every season, the annual blind taste test. Patrick in a confessional says that he's genuinely beyond excited to make it this far to doing the blind taste test because this was the one challenge that he has been waiting to do since he got onto the show. Ramsay then says that this blind taste test is going to be different because he's going to replace the texture of the ingredients with flavors of gelatin. Hiroto in a confessional says that he's initially worried going into this challenge because he's afraid of getting some super obscure protein that he wouldn't know the English name for, however since it's just going to be flavors he doesn't think that it'll be that bad.

Ramsay then says that one person will get close to him to taste whatever ingredients that they are going to be tasting in that round and someone else who's going to be sitting in that stool. Ramsay then says that if the person guessing gets 0,1 or 2 wrong then they'll be perfectly clean, but if they get 3 wrong then they'll get covered in gelatin dropped by their sous chefs and if they get 4 wrong that the sous chefs will dump whipped cream on them. The chefs nod a bit.   
  
Ramsay then says that since the red team is down a chef someone will have to go twice. William raises his hand basically immediately. Ramsay says that he loves the confidence and that he's going to go twice for the red team. Hiroto in a confessional says that he thinks that William is by far the strongest chef in the red team so he has a lot of faith in William to master this blind taste test. Ramsay then tells William from the red team and Karen from the blue team to step forward. And then he tells Homer from the blue team and Penelope from the red team to sit on the stools. Homer in a confessional says that it's a bit weird to be walking over and sitting in a stool like he's one of those people who has to sit in a corner wearing a “dunce” cap but it is what it is.   
  
There's a shot of Homer and Penelope sitting in the colored stools that are far apart from each other (Homer is sitting on the blue one while Penelope is sitting on the red one). Then there is a shot of Karen and William who are now wearing blindfolds putting on some kind of headphones. Ramsay asks William if he can hear him. William doesn't respond. Ramsay asks Karen if she can hear her. Karen doesn't respond. Ramsay then lifts a dome which reveals 4 different cups of gelatin each in a different color. 

Ramsay puts a spoon into one of the colored gelatin cups. There’s a shot of both William and Karen opening their mouths for whatever is going to put inside of their mouths. The very first ingredient is “onion” and Ramsay puts the onion-flavored gelatin into both of their mouths with two different spoons. Karen in a confessional says that it’s really weird to be fed gelatin by chef Ramsay, she would add on that she’s aware that there’s some people who would be into that but she isn’t one of them. Ramsay taps on Karen’s shoulder signaling the question of what flavor was it that she tasted. Karen guesses “turnip” which is wrong. Ramsay then taps on William’s shoulder trying to signal the same thing. William guesses “onion” which is correct.   
  
Ramsay then lifts up the next flavor of gelatin which is “lemon” with two different spoons and puts those spoons into both of their mouths. Ramsay then taps on William’s shoulder. William guesses that it’s “lemon” which is correct. Ramsay taps on Karen’s shoulder. Karen guesses that it’s “lemon” which is also correct.   
  
Ramsay then grabs the next flavor of gelatin which is “tomato” and puts the gelatin into both of their mouths. Penelope in a confessional says that William has an amazing palette and that she’s sure that William is going to go 4/4. Ramsay taps on William’s shoulder and William says that it’s “cherry” which is wrong. Penelope in that same confessional says that she spoke too soon. Ramsay then taps on Karen’s shoulder and Karen says that it’s “apple” which is wrong.   
  
Ramsay then uses two different spoons to grab the last flavor of gelatin which is “avocado”. Ramsay puts the avocado flavored gelatin into both of their mouths. Homer in a confessional says that Karen has gone 1 for 3 and he’s really hoping that she gets this next one right because he doesn’t want to get splattered with gelatin. Ramsay taps on Karen’s shoulder and Karen guesses “avocado” which is correct. Ramsay then taps on William’s shoulder and William guesses “avocado” which is correct. Ramsay pulls one side of the headphones to tell them ""well done"" and to take their headsets and blindfolds off.   
  
William in a confessional says that he got the red team off to a good lead and now it’s up to everyone else to maintain that lead. Ramsay tells the two of them to sit into the stools, and there’s a shot of the two chefs walking towards the stools while Homer and Penelope are walking away from the stools that they previously sat on. The score is currently 3 for the red team and 2 for the blue team.

Ramsay then tells both Patrick and Hiroto to come over here because they’re going to be next. Hiroto in a confessional says that he doesn’t know really that much about what this challenge is going to be like but he’s really hoping to do at least as good as William did. There’s a shot with both Patrick and Hiroto with both their blindfolds and headphones on. There’s a shot of 4 new cups of gelatin on the table that Ramsay, Patrick, and Hiroto are standing near to.   
  
Ramsay then uses two new spoons and puts both of them into the gelatin. Ramsay puts some “turnip” flavored gelatin into both of their open mouths. Patrick in a confessional says that he feels very confident with what he’s tasting right now. Ramsay taps on Patrick’s shoulder and Patrick guesses “bell pepper” which is wrong. Ramsay then taps on Hiroto’s shoulder and Hiroto guesses “radish” which is wrong.   
  
Ramsay then uses the spoons for some “peach” flavored gelatin and puts the gelatin into both Patrick and Hiroto’s open mouths.  Ramsay taps on Patrick’s shoulder and Patrick guesses that it’s “potato” which is wrong. Karen in a confessional says that she doesn’t understand how you get potatoes from peaches. Ramsay taps on Hiroto’s shoulder and he guesses that it’s “carrot” which is wrong.   
  
Ramsay then uses those spoons to grab some “mango” flavored gelatin. Ramsay taps on Hiroto’s shoulders with there being a shot of William looking nervous. Ramsay tells both William and Karen to stand by. Hiroto guesses “mango” which is correct. Ramsay then taps on Patrick’s shoulder. Patrick guesses that it’s “mango” which is correct.   
  
Ramsay then uses the spoons to grab the final gelatin flavor which is “pineapple” flavored. Ramsay taps on Patrick’s shoulder and Patrick says “pineapple”. There’s a shot of Karen saying “thank god” while on the stools. Ramsay then taps on Hiroto’s shoulder. William in a confessional says that all Hiroto needs to guess is pineapple, it’s one of the most defined flavors and he’s begging Hiroto to guess pineapple. Hiroto just says “umm…”. William in that same confessional says that he needs Hiroto to say pineapple. Hiroto guesses that it’s “banana” which is incorrect. William in a confessional says that yeah Hiroto didn’t guess pineapple in the slightest.   
  
Then there’s a shot of sous chef Jamie standing somewhere on some kind of stairs that is above the miniature wall that William is standing behind and then Jamie begins to dump a bunch of red colored gelatin onto William. There’s a shot of the blue team (minus Patrick) just laughing. Then they show a shot of both Hiroto and Patrick taking off their blindfolds and Hiroto just looks at William (who’s covered in red gelatin) in shock. Hiroto in a confessional says that the blind taste test is a lot harder than it looks and that now he’s pretty embarrassed that now William is covered in gelatin. Hiroto just says that he’s sorry to William. The score is now 4 for the red team and 4 for the blue team.

There’s a shot of Hiroto and Patrick walking towards the stools that Karen and William previously sat on while the two of them walk back to where the rest of their team is standing. Ramsay then calls on Adam and Amy to come over to him. Patrick in a confessional says that he’s a bit worried about Adam being the literal next one to do the blind taste test because he feels like Adam could intentionally do poorly to fuck with him.  
  
There’s a shot of Adam and Amy putting on the headphones with their blindfolds on already. Adam in a confessional says that he knows that he has this, he’s got a great palette and to make it better he’s going up against the pig (Amy) which means that he’s going to put the blue team in a great lead. Ramsay uses two brand new spoons and grabs some “bell pepper” flavored gelatin and puts the gelatin into both Amy and Adam’s open mouths. Ramsay taps on Amy’s shoulder and she guesses that it’s “radish” which is wrong. Ramsay then taps on Adam’s shoulder and he guesses that it’s “radish” as well which is wrong.  
  
Ramsay then uses the two new spoons to grab “salmon” flavored gelatin. Sebastian says out-loud that it’s a win. Ramsay overhears him, and repeats “it’s a win”. Sebastian says that Adam is from Alaska he should know exactly what that is. Ramsay then taps on Adam’s shoulder. Adam says that he’s never tasted this before in his life and then he guesses “scallop” which is wrong. Homer in a confessional points out that Adam is from Alaska and that he doesn’t understand how he didn't know what salmon was. Ramsay then taps on Amy’s shoulder. Amy guesses that it’s “tuna” which is wrong.   
  
There’s a shot of Patrick and Hiroto looking a bit worried. Ramsay tells both Hiroto and Patrick to stand by. Ramsay then uses those 2 spoons to grab some “carrot” flavored gelatin and puts them in both Adam and Amy’s open mouths. Ramsay taps on Amy’s shoulder and she guesses that it’s “apricot” which is wrong. There’s a shot of Sous Chef Jamie dumping some red flavored gelatin into Hiroto which is followed by another shot of the blue team just laughing at what they see. Ramsay then taps on Adam’s shoulder and he guesses that it’s “mint” which is wrong. Homer in a confessional just laughs a bit and he doesn’t understand how Adam got mint and at this point he’s probably just saying random foods that come to his mind.   
  
There’s a shot of Sous Chef Andrew just dumping some blue flavored gelatin into Patrick which is followed by a shot of the red team just laughing. Ramsay then says that he’s going to make this easy and then there’s a shot of him using those two spoons to dig into some “cherry” flavored gelatin. Ramsay puts those spoons into both Adam and Amy’s open mouths. Patrick in a confessional says that he really wants Adam to get something right because he does not want to get showered in whipped cream. Ramsay taps on Adam’s shoulder. Adam guesses that it’s “apple” which is wrong. Patrick in a confessional just shows off the middle finger and he says that this is specifically for Adam. There’s a shot of sous chef Andrew just dumping some whipped cream all over Patrick which is followed by more laughing from the red team. Ramsay then taps on Amy’s shoulder. Amy guesses that it’s “tomato” which is wrong. Then there’s a shot of sous chef Jamie just dumping whipped cream onto Hiroto. Amy in a confessional says that this is a lot harder than it looks and that no amount of training can ever help with something like that. As Adam and Amy take off their blindfolds and take off their headphones, Ramsay says that they both got 0 for 4 and that’s pathetic. The score remains at 4 for the red team and 4 for the blue team.

Ramsay then tells Sebastian and Penelope that the two of them are next. There’s a shot of Adam and Amy walking over to the stools as Patrick and Hiroto walk out of the stools. Sebastian in a confessional says that he feels nervous going into the competition but he’s got to do better than a 0 out of 4. There’s a shot of Sebastian and Penelope putting on their headphones while they already have their blindfolds on. Ramsay uses two new spoons and uses them to grab some “pea” flavored gelatin. Penelope in a confessional says that she’s 50 years old but she thinks that her palette is strong so she’s got this. Ramsay taps on Penelope’s shoulder and she says that it’s “green bean” which is wrong. Ramsay then taps on Sebastian’s shoulder and he says that it’s “peas” which is correct.   
  
Ramsay then uses those spoons to scoop up some “asparagus” flavored gelatin and then puts the gelatin into both Penelope and Sebastian’s open mouths. Ramsay taps on Penelope’s shoulder and she says that it’s “asparagus” which is correct. Ramsay then taps on Sebastian’s shoulder and he says that it’s “asparagus” which is correct.   
  
Ramsay then scoops up the next flavor of gelatin which is “broccoli” flavored gelatin and then puts it into both Penelope and Sebastian’s open mouths. There’s a shot of the blue team just standing there and thinking. Ramsay taps on Sebastian’s shoulder, and he guesses that it’s “broccoli” which is correct. Ramsay then taps on Penelope’s shoulder, and she guesses that it’s “pear” which is wrong. Ramsay then tells Adam that he is safe from getting splattered. Patrick in a confessional says that Adam should be lucky that Sebastian has an amazing palette because he feels like Adam should’ve also gotten some gelatin dumped on him.   
  
Ramsay then scoops up the final gelatin flavor which is “mushroom”. When Ramsay puts the gelatin into both of their mouths, Sebastian has a bit of a nauseated face on him. Sebastian in a confessional says that he feels like Ramsay put shit inside of his mouth because he can’t understand what he’s tasting. Ramsay taps on Sebastian’s shoulder and he guesses that it’s “couscous” which is wrong. Ramsay then tells Amy to stand by. Amy says that she doesn’t want to shower. Ramsay taps on Penelope’s shoulder and she guesses that it’s “potato” which is wrong. Sous chef Jamie just dumps red colored gelatin onto Amy as the blue team laughs even harder than usual. Amy in a confessional says that she feels like she has gelatin in places that really shouldn’t have gelatin and she feels really cold from that. There’s a shot of Sebastian and Penelope taking off their headphones with their blindfolds still on and as they proceed to take off their blindfolds, Penelope just sees Amy covered in gelatin and she just looks shocked. Penelope in a confessional says that she did better than Amy so she views it as a win. The score is now 5 for the red team and 7 for the blue team.

Sebastian and Penelope start to walk their way into the stools that Amy and Adam previously sat on as Adam and Amy start to walk towards their teams. Ramsay then tells William and Homer to come over to him. William in a confessional says that Penelope really fucked with their lead and he needs to make the red team bounce back from this.   
  
There’s a shot of William and Homer putting on the headphones while they already have blindfolds on. Ramsay then puts two new spoons into some “pear” flavored gelatin. Ramsay puts the spoons into both William and Homer’s already open mouths. Ramsay taps on William’s shoulder and he guesses that it’s “pear” which is correct. Ramsay then taps on Homer’s shoulder and he also guesses that it’s “pear” which is correct.   
  
There’s a shot of Ramsay scooping up the next gelatin which is some “sweet potato” flavored gelatin and he puts the gelatin into William and Homer’s open mouths. Ramsay taps on William’s shoulder and he guesses that it’s “sweet potato” which is correct. Ramsay then taps on Homer’s shoulder and he guesses that it’s “sweet potato” which is correct. Amy in a confessional says that she’s badly hoping for Homer to get the next two wrong and William to get the next two right or else it’s over for the red team.   
  
Ramsay then scoops up the next cup of gelatin which is “bacon” flavor. Ramsay then says that unless Homer gets this wrong and William gets this right then the blue team will automatically win this challenge. Ramsay taps on William’s shoulder. William says that it’s “beans” which is incorrect. Penelope in a confessional just says “we just lost again… fuck…”. Ramsay then taps on Homer’s shoulder and he guesses that it’s “bacon” which is correct.   
  
Ramsay then says that even though the blue team won the challenge he’s still going to let them taste the last flavor. Ramsay then scoops up some “garlic” flavored gelatin and puts the gelatin into both William and Homer’s open mouths. Ramsay then taps on William’s shoulder and he guesses that it’s “vinegar” which is incorrect. Ramsay then says that he’s going to see if Homer will go 4 for 4. Ramsay then taps on Homer’s shoulder and he guesses “garlic” which is correct. Hiroto says in a confessional that it’s embarrassing to not only lose again but to get blown out by someone who got a perfect score. There’s a shot of Homer and William taking off their headphones and blindfolds.   
  
Ramsay then tells Homer congratulations and that he won it for his team. Homer in a confessional says that he’s never been tested so hard with his palette before in his life but he’s really happy that he managed to ace what he deems to be the hardest test of his sense of taste in his life. There’s a shot of Penelope and Sebastian walking back to their teams from the stools that they were seated on and Sebastian looks really happy while Penelope looks super disappointed. 

After a small skip in time, both teams are standing there. Ramsay tells the blue team that they won another challenge and that their reward is going to be amazing because they’re going to be going golfing at the scenic LakeRidge Golf Course. The blue team all starts to clap in excitement. Karen in a confessional says that she’s never gone golfing in her life but she’s looking forward to trying something new for the first time. Ramsay then asks the blue team what are they waiting for and he tells them to go have fun. The blue team starts to run into the direction of the kitchen and then running down the hallway which leads to the dorms.   
  
Ramsay then looks at the red team and he tells them that they lost once again. Ramsay says that this punishment is going to be exhausting because they’re going to be cleaning up the mess that they made in the blind taste test and then afterwards since it’s family night in Hell’s Kitchen they’re going to need to assemble several crayon boxes for the kids to color with. Ramsay then tells the red team to go into the dorms and clean themselves up before they start to clean the dorms. William in a confessional says that he feels like the literal second that something good happens to this red team, they’re immediately hit with losing again and that he feels like at points enough is enough and they just need a break. There’s a shot of the red team all walking into the kitchen and down into the hallway to go into the dorms.  
\------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Reward:

There are several shots of the LakeRidge Golf Course just being shown to just show what the location of the place looks like. There’s a shot of the 5 chefs wearing some kind of golf uniform all driving in two separate golf carts (Adam and Sebastian on one. Homer, Karen, and Patrick on the other). Homer in a confessional says that he hasn’t played golf in a long while but he’s definitely happy to be out in the sun and to just appreciate the nature that’s around this golf course. There’s a shot of Homer placing the golf ball onto the tee seemingly ready to swing at it. Patrick asks Homer if he thinks that he’s got it. Homer responds by saying that it’s a bit bright today but he thinks that he can handle it. Homer swings the golf ball and it’s a decently far shot which makes it into the green but still a bit of a distance away from the hole. There’s some clapping with the 4 other chefs. Patrick in a confessional says that it’s nice to be out in the sun to just play some golf and that he’ll admit that it’s actually pretty fun when he’s around several people.   
  
Then there’s a montage of the 5 chefs just taking turns swinging at their own golf balls and it landing in the greens. Karen in a confessional says that she heard a lot of people say that golf was boring but now that she’s played it for the first time that she feels like she couldn’t be any more wrong. Then there’s a shot of Karen trying to swing her golf ball and it lands into the water. Karen in a confessional says that yeah it’s fun but obviously sometimes the ball lands into the water.   
  
Sebastian asks Karen if she wants to just grab a new golf ball from their supply because he has extra golf balls, with Karen saying that she does. Sebastian in a confessional says that he’s pretty glad that this isn’t for points for anything because most of them aren’t that great at golf but he says that it’s a lot of fun and it’s enjoyable to have the blue team not argue for once.   
  
Then they show a shot of Adam using a putter to knock a golf ball close to the hole but it doesn’t land there. Adam in a confessional while chuckling says that he feels like Happy Gilmore right now in the way that he wants to yell at the ball to go into the home so badly. There’s a shot of Homer just saying that it was like 2 feet away from the hole and chuckling a bit. Adam just responds that it’s fine and for someone else to knock their ball close to the hole. Patrick uses his putter to swing his ball and it knocks Adam’s golf ball a bit further away. Adam just mumbles “you got to be kidding me…”. Patrick in a confessional says that golf is fun, and he loves the course a lot and if he ever takes a trip back to Reno that he’ll go out of his way to play some golf again because he loved this a lot. There’s a shot of the blue team going to drive to some other hole while driving the golf carts that they were in.  
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Punishment:

There’s a shot of the red team just cleaning the mess of gelatin that’s all over the floor from the blind taste test. Penelope in a confessional says that there is just so much gelatin that it’s just really disgusting to look at. There’s a shot of the red team just throwing away the gelatin into trash bags. Marino walks by the red team and he comments that this looks like they’re cleaning up a body after someone died like they’re in the mafia. William just comments “mama mia” without much thought. Marino says that he’s not even saying that phrase correctly. William just looks down and does not respond.   
  
There’s a shot of Amy just sweating a lot while cleaning this stuff. Amy in a confessional says that she’s been cleaning for a bit and being 300 pounds just makes her very sweaty and that she isn’t used to this kind of labor. Penelope tells Amy to just stop sweating because they’ve only been cleaning for like 30 minutes. Amy says that she can’t help it and that she’s getting tired. Penelope tells her to just drink some water because they need to clean once they scoop up all of the gelatin. Penelope in a confessional says that she knows that Amy is a liability in this kitchen and that it’s a miracle that she was able to do this many punishments without a trip to the hospital.   
  
After a bit of time has passed, the 4 chefs are currently getting soap to deep clean the floors because of the excess gelatin that’s everywhere. Amy sweats a bit more as her sweat drips into the floor. Penelope gets pissed off and she tells her to just not help because she’s making this take a lot longer. Hiroto in a confessional says that Penelope and Amy have been fighting for a bit just because of Amy sweating a lot and that he really hopes that the two of them just get it together. Amy then says that she’ll leave then. Amy starts to walk away in frustration. William says in a confessional says that it’s tiring to have the 3 of them just scrub the floors but he’d rather work with less people than have another person who’s sweating and might make this take longer. There’s a shot of William, Hiroto, and Penelope all cleaning the floors.

After a bit more time has passed, there’s some small montage of the 4 chefs all putting in crayons into crayon boxes for family night in Hell’s Kitchen. Hiroto in a confessional says that he’s never assembled crayons before in his life but he’ll admit that now that he’s done it, he never wants to do it again. There’s a shot of Amy just struggling to put in the crayons into the crayon box. Amy just comments that this is really hard to put in.   
  
Penelope then comments to just sweat into the crayons and that they’ll fit in. Penelope laughs a bit at her own comment. Amy just says that she wants to do the punishment and for them to be normal about this. Penelope in a confessional says that Amy is the main reason that they’re even doing a punishment and she’s fed up with her. Penelope then tells her to just eat the crayons since they’d probably taste like circus cookies to her. Amy looks a bit annoyed but doesn’t make a comment. Amy in a confessional says that everyone thinks that she’s useless because she got 0 out of 4 on the blind taste test.   
  
William then makes a quick joking comment about how he thinks that Amy can’t taste circus cookies. Penelope laughs a bit and she says that Amy would probably think that the orange crayons would taste like carrots. Amy in a confessional says that she wished that her team actually cared about her for once. Penelope then just says that Amy fucked the whole team over. Amy starts to walk away from the red kitchen and into the direction of the dorms.   
  
Then they show a shot of Amy just crying in the dorms. Amy in a confessional says that this has been so far the most difficult night for her in Hell’s Kitchen and she thought that the bullying about her weight would end but in fact it’s only ever gotten worse. There’s a shot of Amy walking back into the red kitchen with the other 3 chefs on the red team. Amy in a confessional says that she needs to come back and be a team player even if she’s pissed off with everyone.   
  
William asks Amy if she’s okay. Amy just says “yeah”. Then Amy in the red kitchen asks if any of them needs any help to make things more interesting. Penelope just says that she appreciates it if Amy just didn’t talk until dinner service started. Amy just responds by saying that this is something that she can do. Penelope then tells her to just shut up then. Then they just show a shot of Amy just putting crayons into a crayon box without saying anything but she’s pretty annoyed.

Possible TW?: mentions falling asleep with baby and cosleeping

***If you're just going to bash, please move along. I'm struggling here and trying to do the best I can to keep my baby safe. I promise I kick myself enough for not always being capable of doing that, and my mental state really doesn't need people piling on right now. Sorry for the text wall.

Hey all... I'm trying my best but I don't know what to do anymore because it seems like no matter what I try I can't always stay awake long enough to transfer my baby to his bassinet for safe sleep. I exclusively nurse, which makes me be the one getting up for every feed in the night. I do wake my husband up to change diapers every time so I can move around and grab things, but he goes back to sleep right after. Baby boy has really bad reflux, and the sweet spot for him being able to not wake up or choke from it is holding him for about 25ish minutes after every feed... meaning between diapering, feeding, and holding him, it takes about 45 minutes every wake period before I can put him down. Feeding isn't the issue, but on tough nights or during times where the lack of sleep catches up to me, I cannot keep my brain from powering off during that 25 minute wait. I have tried/do:

•Moving around first
•snacking while awake
•drinking ice cold water
•drinking a soda or small coffee 
•moving to another spot
•splashing water on my face first
•using the bathroom with bright lights in my eyes first
•keeping blankets off me so I'm cold
•playing games/scrolling on my phone
•unfortunately berating myself and lecturing myself to keep my eyes open if I know it's a rough night

I'm at a loss. Most nights/wakes I can do it... but usually at some point during the night, I catch myself nodding off or just wake up after like 30 minutes to see he has slid down from my stupid sleeping arms. When that happens, I try to be proactive with the situation and put us in the best spot I can for now... but I know it damn well doesn't follow the safe sleep 7 because we can't afford anything to put on the ground and our mattress is ridiculously squishy. I don't love the way we end up contact sleeping, but I know it at least isn't a suffocation risk and he won't fall because my arms are supported and he doesn't roll yet. But I want to be able to get him to his bassinet because he WILL sleep in it at night.

I guess what I'm asking is are there any other tricks you have done that seem to help you stay awake? Or what you've done in my position to help make baby as safe as possible when SS7 isn't available? What cheap ways have you found, if any, to make a SS7 environment when you don't really have money? Most months I don't even know how rent is going to get figured out, so even the $60 mattress toppers from amazon I've kept an eye on aren't an option right now. Even just solidarity to hear I'm not awful at that part of this whole mom thing. I just want to keep him safe.

I can smell none of this. To me it's more like a cross between a really artificial cleaning product and cheap men's aftershave. No hint of coffee, lavender OR vanilla. I assume that this is the orange blossom and pepper completely overpowering everything else.

here's what i learned from books, research, therapists on youtube, podcasts, all of it. depression doesn't always look like someone sobbing in bed for days (though that's valid too). sometimes it's way more subtle and honestly more insidious because you don't even recognize it's happening to you.

this isn't about pathologizing normal human emotions or turning temporary sadness into a clinical diagnosis. but if multiple signs resonate, it might be worth exploring deeper. and here's the thing, depression is often a result of various factors like biology, environment, trauma, societal pressures, and sometimes just shitty life circumstances stacking up. the point isn't to blame yourself but to recognize patterns and get the right support.

## the sneaky signs most people miss

**1. you're constantly exhausted no matter how much you sleep**

not just tired. like bone deep exhaustion that coffee can't fix. you sleep 8 hours and wake up feeling like you got hit by a truck. or you sleep 12 hours and still need a nap. this isn't laziness, it's your brain and body running on fumes. Dr. Saundra Jain (clinical psychologist) talks about how depression literally drains your neurochemicals, which is why even basic tasks feel impossible.

**2. your brain feels foggy all the time**

memory issues, can't focus, constantly zoning out during conversations. you read the same paragraph five times and retain nothing. Johann Hari calls this ""the fog"" in his book Lost Connections (bestselling author who spent years researching depression globally). that book will honestly make you question everything you thought you knew about why we're all so miserable. he breaks down how modern life systematically disconnects us from things we actually need, and depression is often a logical response to abnormal circumstances. insanely good read.

**3. you stop enjoying things that used to excite you**

this is called anhedonia and it's brutal. your favorite hobby feels like a chore. hanging out with friends feels exhausting. food tastes bland. sex drive vanishes. nothing brings pleasure anymore, you're just going through motions. this was the biggest red flag for me personally when i was struggling.

**4. you're irritable and angry instead of sad**

especially common in men but affects everyone. you snap at small things, everything annoys you, you have zero patience. people think you're just an asshole but really your nervous system is completely dysregulated. Dr. Gabor Mate talks extensively about this in his work on trauma and mental health.

**5. physical pain with no clear cause**

headaches, back pain, stomach issues that doctors can't explain. depression lives in your body too. there's actual research showing the gut brain connection and how depression manifests physically. the app Finch (for habit building and mental health check ins) helped me track these patterns and realize how connected my physical symptoms were to my mental state.

**6. you're ""functional"" but running on autopilot**

you go to work, pay bills, maintain relationships, but you're not really present. you're a ghost in your own life. this is high functioning depression and it's so normalized that people don't even realize they're suffering. you become really good at performing normalcy while feeling absolutely nothing inside.

**7. your sleep schedule is completely wrecked**

either sleeping way too much (hypersomnia) or barely sleeping at all (insomnia). or my personal favorite, both somehow. awake until 4am, sleep until noon, wake up feeling worse. your circadian rhythm is destroyed and that feeds back into worsening depression.

**8. you isolate and cancel plans constantly**

not because you hate people but because the thought of socializing feels overwhelming. you make excuses, ghost texts, avoid calls. then you feel guilty about it which makes you isolate more. vicious cycle.

**9. you're either eating everything or nothing**

depression fucks with appetite in both directions. some people stress eat and gain weight, others can't stomach food and lose weight rapidly. neither gets taken seriously enough. changes in appetite and weight are major diagnostic criteria for a reason.

**10. you think about death more than usual**

not necessarily active suicidal ideation (though please get help immediately if that's happening). but like, passive thoughts. ""i wouldn't mind if i didn't wake up tomorrow."" ""what's even the point of all this."" ""everyone would be fine without me."" these thoughts are concerning even when they're not accompanied by plans.

## what actually helps (from someone who's been there)

therapy obviously, but specifically evidence based approaches. The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk (renowned trauma researcher, bestselling book that completely changed how we understand trauma and depression). this book is DENSE but holy shit it explains so much about why traditional talk therapy sometimes isn't enough and why body based approaches matter. best book on trauma i've ever encountered.

also check out Huberman Lab podcast episodes on depression and dopamine. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist at Stanford and breaks down the actual mechanisms happening in your brain, plus science backed protocols for managing symptoms. his episode on leveraging dopamine is genuinely life changing.

for people who want to go deeper on mental health but don't have the energy to work through dense psychology books, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that might be useful. it pulls from books like the ones mentioned above, research papers on depression and trauma, expert interviews, and creates personalized audio learning based on what you're dealing with. you can tell it something like ""i'm struggling with high functioning depression and want practical strategies to feel more present in my life"" and it builds a learning plan around that specific goal. 

the depth is adjustable too, from quick 10 minute overviews to 40 minute deep dives with examples and context. plus you can pick different voices, some people find the calmer tones helpful when they're already overwhelmed. it makes absorbing this kind of information way less draining than forcing yourself through textbooks when your brain is already foggy.

medication can be incredibly helpful for some people. it's not a cop out or weakness, sometimes your brain literally needs chemical support to function. work with a good psychiatrist who listens.

the app Insight Timer has tons of free guided meditations specifically for depression. meditation isn't a cure all but it can help create tiny moments of relief and build awareness of thought patterns.

movement, even just walking 20 minutes daily, has comparable effects to antidepressants in some studies. not saying skip meds and just exercise, but physical movement genuinely helps regulate mood.

connection is crucial. i know it feels impossible when you're depressed but isolation makes everything worse. even just texting one person or sitting near other humans helps.

and honestly, sometimes depression is telling you something important. maybe your job is soul crushing. maybe you're in a toxic relationship. maybe you're living a life that doesn't align with your values. depression can be a signal that something needs to change, not just a malfunction to be fixed.

## final thoughts

if you're reading this and recognizing yourself, you're not broken. you're not weak. you're dealing with something incredibly difficult that millions of people face. the fact that society treats depression like a personal failing instead of a legitimate health issue that deserves support is absolute bullshit.

getting help isn't giving up, it's the opposite. it takes more strength to admit you're struggling and reach out than to keep white knuckling through life pretending you're fine.

start small. talk to one person. make one appointment. download one app. read one chapter. you don't have to fix everything today. you just have to take the next tiny step.",2,1771436260.0,TheMindSpace,0,1.0,False

1r89kg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1r89kg5/going_to_pull_another_overnighter/,Going to pull another overnighter,"I decided to pull another overnighter today as I am drowning in stress and guilt for not getting a few simple tasks done.

The only New Year’s resolution I set for 2026 is to sleep at least 6 hours every night. I have a few simple tasks at work that I could finish in a few hours but I have been pushing them every single day as I cannot focus during work hours. I am working from home and have no outside disturbance either so this is purely on me for not doing it. I have no one else to blame. I do work 8 hours per day on more interesting things than the priority task that I should do.

Since two weeks I feel awful at the end of the day for not doing it. I close my laptop and tell myself I will wake up early in the morning and do it.

Next morning I wake up super early and am at my laptop after drinking my coffee and watch myself drift away. I hate it. I am telling my colleagues to not disturb me because I want to focus on this specific task to have more accountability but it doesn’t help. I am good at my job and everyone trusts me so no one questions me either. I will finish it eventually at the very last minute but I should not as this is almost gambling.

So after resisting it for two weeks I decided to give up now when closing my laptop. I will tell my husband that I will work overnight and it will be an annoying discussion because he always brings the argument that I should not and I already work so much and I am overworked. And I get pissed off because he is not trusting me when I say that the problem is not that I have too much to do but that I don’t follow priorities.

I am diagnosed with ADHD. I am not medicated or in therapy (yet). Once I get these tasks done tonight I will reach out to a psychiatrist. The thing is that these priority tasks also act kind of as a blocker for me to do other priority tasks.

E.g.: I need to do these tasks on a computer so after work hours I avoid computers because when I use them I feel guilt for not doing the work tasks.

On the other hand in these two weeks I have cleaned my closet given the bathroom a detailed scrub from top to bottom sorted out unused bedding and threw them away learned how to solve a Rubik’s cube read a book halfway. I even emptied ""the chair"". (The one which is always full of clothes which are put on the bed when I start working in the morning and then put again on the chair when I go to bed at night.)

I think I did all of this as a compensation for the guilt from the work task.

Sorry for this post I just wanted to share it with someone but neither my husband nor anyone I am in a good relationship with seems to understand how something like this can cause this level of discomfort. And I am met with pure lack of understanding for why I am just not doing it. Thanks, I also don’t understand it.

I need to see someone about this I can’t go on like this.

If you have any ideas, I’m open to suggestions.

It all started almost a month ago. I was finishing up some work, shut down my computer, and got ready for bed. Brushed my teeth, put on my pajamas, and turned on a nature documentary at low volume. I set the sleep timer and tried to fall asleep. A few minutes later, the TV turned off, but I still couldn’t sleep. Must’ve been the coffee I had earlier to finish my work.

I started thinking about what I’d done, what I might’ve forgotten. I realized I still hadn’t paid the internet bill and the due date was coming up. I was about to grab my phone to watch some funny videos when I heard a strangely familiar noise: a boom.

Probably the neighbors, I thought. Or an animal outside—a cat, maybe. But then it happened again. Boom. Nothing crazy, just the sound of something hitting the floor. This time it was clearer: it was coming from inside the house.

I looked around for a weapon. The closest thing I had was my camera tripod. I grabbed it as aggressively as I could and headed to the living room. Another boom. I walked slowly, holding my breath, tensing my arms. I might have to hit someone.

When I got to the living room, I saw the source of the noise: a rubber ball. No bigger than an apple. It bounced off the floor again. Boom. I carefully set the tripod down by the couch and went to the kitchen. I needed water. I turned on the faucet, filled a glass. Another boom.

I walked back and just stood there, watching the ball, one hand on my hip, drinking water. It kept bouncing. Boom. It would rise almost to shoulder height and fall again. Boom. A chill ran through me. I caught it mid-air and set it on the dining table on my way back to the bedroom.

Finished my water, got back in bed. Didn’t hear it again that night. Figured it was just a weird episode.

The next morning, I looked for the ball, wanted to see if it was something special. Couldn’t find it. Went to work, life went on. That night, I tried to sleep early—actually managed to doze off—until it woke me up. Boom.

Same sound. Just a bounce. I stared at the ceiling. Boom. I didn’t want to get up. Couldn’t be bothered. Boom. Shit. Got up, went to the living room, grabbed the ball, and threw it out the window. Went back to bed and fell asleep.

Next day was normal. I told Fred about it. He gave me this weird look, like I was joking. I dropped it. Maybe it was just a bad dream. Went home, tried to sleep, and while I was asleep: boom. I checked the time. 12:35 AM. Got pissed. What kind of sick prank is this?

""I don’t care who you are, this isn’t funny.""

Grabbed the ball, took it to my room, and put it in the nightstand. Next morning, it was gone.

The following night, I invited Fred and his wife Lina over. Poker, drinks. We were in the dining room playing when, right at 12:35, boom. I didn’t say anything. Wanted to see his reaction.

Fred looked at me, confused.

""What’s that sound?""

""It’s the ball. The thing I told you about.""

He gave me this look—almost pity. Then another boom. His expression shifted to mild annoyance. We all went to the living room. There it was. The ball, bouncing almost shoulder-high.

""This isn’t funny, man. You’re going too far.""

He grabbed Lina’s hand and they left without another word. The ball bounced again. Boom.

I grabbed it and threw it out the window as hard as I could. Cleaned up the table and went to bed. At least now I knew I wasn’t hallucinating.

The nights kept going like that. Every single night, exactly at 12:35, the bounce. Boom. I bought earplugs. Didn’t matter. The sound cut right through them. Boom. Boom. Boom.

I tried getting rid of it. Threw it in the trash. Threw it in the river. Gave it away. It always came back. Thought maybe it was the house. Called a priest. He did an exorcism, told me to pray. I did. Thought it would work. That night, right at 12:35, the goddamn ball was back. Boom.

Got a hotel room. Maybe it was the house. Everything was fine—until 12:35. Boom. The ball, bouncing in the hallway.

Went to a witch. She said it was a curse. Charged me a month’s salary to lift it. I paid. Thought it was over. That night, 12:35. Boom.

I snapped. Grabbed the ball, took it to the kitchen, picked up the sharpest knife I had, and cut it to pieces. Wanted to see if there was something inside. There was nothing. I threw the pieces into the fireplace and lit it. Watched it burn. Caught a faint smell of iron. Doused the fire, scooped up the ashes, and tossed them.

Went to sleep.

Next day, my boss fired me. Said I’d been missing too much work. Terrible day. That night, I couldn’t sleep. And at 12:35, the ball bounced again. Boom.

Went to Fred the next day. Tried to explain, tried to stay calm, tried to make him understand.

""I know it sounds crazy. Please, believe me.""

He invited me over. Tried to make it nice, told old stories from when we were kids. We were laughing, having drinks, when at 12:35, the ball bounced in the next room. This time, Fred’s face went pale. Real horror. I started walking toward it. He stopped me. Just stood there, watching it bounce.

""This is impossible.""

He waved his hands around it, looking for strings. Nothing. I grabbed it.

""I’ve tried everything.""

""I’m sorry.""

I went back home in the early morning, tried to sleep. Fred hasn’t called me since. I’ve tried calling him. He doesn’t answer.

1r89htv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r89htv,🍸 Cocktail Roulette – The Shaker Game,"The idea of the game is simple: each player draws ingredients using the shaker, building their own cocktail recipe. The drawn balls correspond to ingredients assigned in the Menu, and once a full set is collected, players prepare real drinks based on their created recipes.

The idea came from a very simple party problem:

👉 What’s the next drink?

Instead of debating, you let randomness decide — bringing people together, sparking conversations, and often leading to the creation of completely new cocktails (sometimes even with their own names 😄).

The project is inspired by the atmosphere of a classic bar and mechanical randomness.

It was designed as an object that is:

 • modular and disassemblable

 • able to store all components in a single object

 • decorative enough to serve as a home bar centerpiece

It includes Assembly Instructions and Game Instructions (PL & EN), making it quick and easy to get started.

If you’d like to take a look, test it, or share feedback — I’d really appreciate it 🙌

1r89g6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1r89g6u/feeling_betrayed/,Feeling betrayed,"(not for the reason you think) 

2 years ago my wife met a friend on bumble bff. She really liked her and was excited to be her friend, but I (f) was nervous. My wife has a very specific type—brown hair, green eyes, olive skin. Her new friend was really pretty (like super model level tbh) and met all of these descriptors. She also told my wife that she didn’t believe in having friends for long—that it showed a lack of personal growth. So, when I met this friend, I was quite stand offish—not rude just guarded and observing. I was concerned about her for obvious reasons (I can be a little insecure sometimes I admit, I’m human after all). I was also concerned about her hurting my wife in the long run because she didn’t sound loyal—also I disagree with the idea that people in general are kind of stepping stone you use on your path to personal growth, I think of friends like family and I’m a very loyal friend. 

Over the years, she (friend) started trying to get closer to me. She asked me to hangout one on one and spent more time with my wife and I together. She was always very guarded—it felt impossible to learn much about her, but we figured this was just her personality. Even though, something felt off in this dynamic, I took a strong liking to her. It’s pretty easy to gain my affection—you just have to be kind. So, we spent more and more time together but there were always red flags/gut feelings I overlooked—the lack of transparency, the general feeling of inauthenticity, her pining after a girl who was in a committed long term relationship, and questions that just struck me as odd “have you made any new friends yet?” Was a common one—it sounded friendly but felt pushy (i work from home so i have to actively seek out friendship and it has been difficult because i honestly don’t love the culture of where i live). I overlooked these things because the friend would drop food off at our house when i was sick and tell me she was lucky to call us friends, etc.

Fast forward to this year, friend lost her job and has been on unemployment for awhile. Her unemployment I guess suddenly ran out. We had a weekly movie night and she canceled and said she needed to focus on applying. At the same time, I had planned a 2 day Airbnb stay in a cabin to go skiing with my wife. I covered everyone’s expenses. The friend right before her birthday said she couldn’t make it because she needed to apply for jobs. We thought this was very strange. Then my wife had a major planned surgery. Nothing from the friend. I was hurt and worried about her so I sent her a gift card to her favorite restaurant and said I hope things start improving for her. She said “thank you, but please don’t do that again” odd. So we figured that she was either very stressed or didn’t want to be friends. I was leaning towards the latter and my wife was leaning towards the former. 

My wife ended up asking her to get coffee. At coffee, the friend basically told my wife that she didn’t want to be friends with me. She said that she tried to become friends with me to gain my trust and said she did like me, but never intended to be friends with me. She said she felt like I had a lot of moods. This contradicts what she has said in the past that I’m difficult read and don’t express my feelings. I admit I have opened up to her more since then, expressing my hurt and frustration with people and my care for her, etc. She also said she felt like I was passive aggressive. I was confused by this because no one has ever described me as passive aggressive in my life. People typically describe me as honest—sometimes to a fault. I very much am a person that says what I mean and means what I say.  I’m sure I have said things that could be taken as passive aggressive, but I never intend to be. She also told my wife that we bring out the best in each other. This is all very confusing feedback to me. My wife also doesn’t know how to feel. She feels very hurt that she was comfortable ending her friendship with my wife over this and not just talking to us, etc. 

Anyway, I’m feeling incredibly betrayed. I feel like her time being friendly to me was all a ruse. I feel like a pawn and a charity case. And deeply misunderstood. I constantly go out of my way for my friends. I’m not wealthy by any means, but we save up to be able to host them in airbnbs—we never ask them to pay or plan meals, I cook for them, bring food when they are sick, spend too much money on their gifts (they last birthday present we bought for her was $300+), and so many other things. I know these are things and sometimes you’re not compatible but why fake it? 

TLDR: friend was pretending to like me to get closer to me wife and actually didn’t like me and now just wants to be friends with my wife. ",4,1771435920.0,Vent,4,1.0,False

**1. Lucy** 

I actually like Lucy and seeing her every season was so sad it was like torture then I see Meaghan Oppenheimer interview and saw that was the point she “punish” Lucy to teach the audience a lesson which honestly ruined the show and just made people hate Lucy more. I’m so curious on what Lucy originally was supposed to be if she wasn’t written to punish the viewers.

Lucy and mom relationship was a huge plot point in season one and to her overall character they completely dropped the ball in that regard of the show. The last thing I remember is them somewhat getting closer again but Steven ruining their relationship again.

**2. Pippa**

Again sloppy writing who is Pippa what is the purpose of her character to be mean to Lucy and cheat on Wriggly? Pippa is just used to show double standards with man and woman.

She sexual assault Wriggly but since she is a woman it was just  brushed off as a joke and labeled as sympathy sex but at the same time Meaghan wrote Alex to show men and sexual trauma but made a joke out of Wriggly.

Bree knew Wriggly was Pippa best friend and boyfriend but still kissed him but it’s okay but Lucy is a pos?

Pippa freaking out when Diana wanted to go to Stanford could’ve been used to show was controlling and manipulative she can be to the people she close too and how a victim and become the predator. 

Pippa bitching about Steven but doing nothing about Chris why nobody addresses that.

**3. Bree and Wriggly** 

They were cute but if the writers decided Wriggly was going to be a good person now why would he still want to be with Bree after her releasing the tape?

**4.The wedding/overrall ending** 

If the ending was realistic then Bree would’ve marry Evan still.

Evan would’ve finally punch Steven.

Diana wouldn’t be with still Pippa.

Lucy would’ve done a Diana and come back with one coffee.

Wriggly would’ve been an actual addict and not friends with Pippa.

if your stomach drops every time you hit deploy, you are not broken. your process is.



here is what we changed to stop the dice roll feeling. took us under a month and the next demo felt boring in the best way.



1. freeze the golden path. we wrote the exact user journey that brings money on a single page in Notion. anything outside that path can be messy. inside that path nothing ships without a test that proves it still works. first week we caught 7 small bugs before users saw them.



2. copy prod to a toy account. we spun up a second environment that mirrors live data but uses fake cards. every release goes there first. I click around for 10 minutes with my coffee. if it feels weird we fix it there. zero user impact. we do this even for spelling fixes. sounds overkill until you remember investors ask for screen shares.



3. one click rollback. we wired a slack command that swaps traffic back to the last version in 45 seconds. no git magic. no asking the team. I typed /rollback from a uber once while my phone was at 3 %. saved the demo.



4. log the money moments. we print a single line when a user hits pay, invite, or export. if those lines stop showing we know in real time. no need to scan 500 lines of noise. we just count them every 5 minutes. first night we spotted a failing webhook before stripe even mailed us.



5. ship dark. new features live behind a flag that only I can see. I turn it on for my own account, then for 5 friendly users. when the error rate stays flat we open to all. growth stays smooth and I sleep.



6. pair every bug with a test. when something breaks we write the smallest test that would have caught it. took us 3 weeks to gather 42 tests. now releases feel like stacking bricks not jenga.



7. small Friday ships only. big stuff ships Tuesday morning. if it breaks we have the whole week to fix without weekend stress. sounds simple. saved us twice already.



8. share the checklist. our release note template has 5 boxes: data backup, rollback ready, logs checked, cost alert set, support notified. takes 3 minutes to tick. removes the “did I forget something” spiral.



9. measure calm not speed. we track “incidents per 10 deploys” instead of “features per week”. when that number dropped below 1 the velocity actually went up because we stopped firefighting.



10. document while it is fresh. every fix gets a one line “why” comment in the code. six months later new hires understand intent without asking me. onboarding time fell from 4 days to 1.5.



the hidden win: investors stopped asking “what if it breaks?” and started asking “how fast can you add x?” that shift alone opened more doors than any pitch tweak.



if you are staring at an upcoming demo and your release gut is in knots, start with step 1 tonight. write the golden path. you will spot flaky spots before they spot you.

Could fans be wrong? Or devs really did a continuity error?","When I first became aware of this issue, albeit a couple years late because apparently I didn't checked Phin's gravestone date when I played the game years ago, my immediate reaction was this question:

**Could the community have misunderstood what is meant by ""1 year ago""? Could it be that it refers to the ending of CTNS rather than the ending of base game?**

But I neglected this idea because that wouldn't be something to be misunderstood. If devs meant something else, it would be more obvious. And surely, something this trivial cannot be misunderstood. Today, I had a little bit of a revelation while grabbing a cup of coffee (with some cake) and I wanted to share it with you.

It has been widely accepted by the community that 2018 game takes place in 2018 due to May Parker's gravestone. Since community's understanding of ""one year later"" means 2019, MM game is dated to 2019 by community even though Phin's gravestone says 2020... this is currently disregarded by saying that it is a continuity error. Furthermore, prequel novel ""Wings of Fury"" by Brittney Morris seems to support this idea. However, Wings of Fury is an unreliable source as it contains major discontinuity errors... but hey, ""parts that don't clash with main material can be regarded as canon"" right -a classic rule-?

In my revelation today, I noticed something that seems to have been missed by the majority of community. When MM game is dated to 2019, it is initially confusing because age of Miles goes up by 2. Some comments I saw provides a quick fix to this issue by adjusting his birthday... quite simple right? Except, this is based on a fundamental mistake. This fix relies on in-game bio being consistent with base game date but age of Miles is STILL 15 during the events of CTNS **-according to a dialogue in Heist-** which makes this fix impossible. Furthermore, community fix is not the only thing that is affected by this as this also makes info in Brittney's book an UNFIXABLE continuity error. And as such, book must be disregarded completely in date discussions.

Since community fix is impossible, we have 3 choices:

1. retcon the date of first game and consider it to be 2019. In fact, MM game actually removes 2018 date from gravestone if I remember correctly... I will have to check this.
2. Keep first game as 2018 and keep second game as 2019. Instead, retcon age of Miles in the first game to be 16 rather than 15.
3. Go back to the question that I have written in the beginning of this post.

First and second options are dirty. First is unsatisfactory and second takes away the poetry of it all: Miles being the same age as Peter's age when it all started. We are left with the third option.

It becomes apparent that ""1 year ago"" must take CTNS ending as basis which puts Miles Morales game to 2020 in accordance with Phin's grave. There is one remaining problem though... it is Peter's age. If MM is in 2020, Peter must be 25 years old rather than 24 years old.

But based on what we discussed so far... perhaps 2020 wasn't a continuity error at all and community misunderstood what is meant by ""one year ago"". Perhaps, Peter's age was the true continuity error after all these years.

I haven't played Spider-Man 2 yet and keep it waiting until I replay Miles Morales after all these years. If SM2 bio says Peter is 25... then everything in this post has a solid proof if SM2 happens after a few months from MM game.

1r89fd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/runninglifestyle/comments/1r89fd2/does_anyone_not_see_major_benefits_eating_before/,Does anyone NOT see major benefits eating before running?,"I'm a morning runner. My weekly runs are between 6-8 miles, and when I'm not in marathon training, my weekend long runs are usually 10-15 (more like 8-10 this month, because the weather has been so awful).

Over the years, I've tried many different strategies with eating in the morning (or not). I've gone with just coffee (black), coffee and my morning gummi vitamins (just normal vitamins, not a euphemism for anything), and also tried protein bars, dried fruits, oatmeal, or a mug of milk or cocoa, and so forth.

My digestive system is very slow, so I don't get runner's trots. But I've noticed that when I do eat something, I don't really see much difference in my performance.  This is despite so many running nutritionists that are very adamant that if you don't eat before any run longer than 60-90 minutes, terrible things will happen. In fact (like today, which prompted this post), I had a small kid's CLIF bar and some almond milk, and seemed to have a really, weird shaky sensation at the second mile of my run. I walked a bit, and salvaged the run, picking up the pace slowly again, but it seemed to be a blood sugar crash. I've gotten that before, eating before my morning runs.

I do eat before races, but because I eat and then drive to the race and warmup, it's a very different time window between running and eating. Also my system seems to be in overdrive and just burn anything up.

When in marathon training, I would eat something small before my long runs, mainly because I knew I would be getting back later and didn't want to get hungry mid-run. I noticed my first few miles would be rough, and then once I digested/worked out what I'd eaten, the second half would be fine, even great.

Not so much looking for advice, just wondering if anyone else experienced something similar--i.e. not getting the promised benefits from eating breakfast before morning running, even running worse? 

I will note that I'm not advocating starving yourself--I just feel that what I eat the day before has much more of an impact on the quality of my run versus the day of, and digesting seems to suck away so much energy from my running.",4,1771435872.0,runninglifestyle,23,0.67,False

 **What is Lync?**

Lync is a free, automatic coding time tracker built for VS Code developers. You install the extension, connect your account, and it silently tracks everything while you code — no manual timers, no stopping and starting, nothing to remember.

  It captures:

  \- How long you actually coded (not just how long VS Code was open)

  \- Which projects and languages you spent time on

  \- Your streaks and daily consistency

  \- Deep work sessions, debug time, and build events

  \- Team activity if you're working with others

Everything syncs to a clean web dashboard at [lync.life](http://lync.life) every 5 minutes automatically.



  **Why Lync is Different**

 Most trackers just count ""time in editor."" Lync uses a proper state machine with states like ACTIVE\_EDIT, ACTIVE\_REVIEW, IDLE, and AWAY — so when you tab out to Google something or your coffee break runs long, that time doesn't inflate your stats. What you see is your real focused coding time.

 Every interval comes with a reason code (like IDLE\_TIMEOUT or WINDOW\_BLUR) so you can audit exactly why time was counted or excluded. No black boxes.

  **Who It's For**

  \- Solo devs who want to understand their actual coding habits

  \- Freelancers who want clarity on how much time each project really takes

  \- Small teams who want a live activity baseline without enterprise bloat



  **Get Started in 2 Minutes**

 1. Install the Lync VS Code extension from the marketplace

 2. Create a free account at [lync.life/signup](http://lync.life/signup)

 3. Paste your API key in extension settings — done

No credit card. No paywall. Free forever.



  **What to post here**

  \- Your coding streaks and dashboard screenshots

  \- Questions about setup or the extension

  \- Feature requests and feedback

  \- Tips for building better dev habits

  \- Anything about developer productivity

That’s the real problem. The “grind harder, eat clean, suffer in silence” mindset is everywhere—from TikTok challenges to hustle culture podcasts. It’s toxic and unsustainable. What finally worked for me? Making the journey feel beautiful. Playful. Intimate. Like a vibe. And yes, I still eat pizza.



This post isn’t about aesthetics. It’s about how creating a romantic relationship with the process can lead to lasting change—without relying on willpower or obsession. These insights are pulled from top-tier research, books, and behavioral science (not from some influencer trying to sell detox tea).



Here’s how to romanticize your weight loss and still live joyfully:



 Make discipline feel delicious, not dreadful  

   Most people think they have a motivation problem. What they really have is a relationship problem—with themselves and their goals.  

   In Atomic Habits, James Clear explains how habits stick when they’re emotionally rewarding. That means you have to associate your actions with pleasure, not just outcomes.  

   So instead of forcing workouts, create a vibe. Put on your favorite playlist. Wear an outfit you love. Light a candle before stretching. Make the gym feel like a self-love sanctuary, not a bootcamp.  

   According to a 2020 meta-analysis published in Psychological Bulletin, people who experience positive emotion during health behavior changes (like eating healthier or exercising) are more likely to maintain them long-term.  



 Eat what you want, but with intention  

   Diet culture tells you to restrict. Reality says restriction leads to bingeing.  

   The key is not eating less, it’s eating intentionally.  

   Harvard's School of Public Health research shows people can achieve weight loss by focusing on overall diet quality, not calorie-counting. Translation: if you’re eating whole, fiber-rich, satisfying foods 80% of the time, the other 20% won’t ruin anything.  

   Gretchen Rubin, author of Better Than Before, calls this ""moderators vs. abstainers""—some people do better allowing small indulgences regularly, which prevents them from crashing later. That’s been clinically confirmed too: a 2018 study in Appetite found greater dietary flexibility was correlated with less emotional eating and better weight outcomes over time.  



 Turn your journey into a main character movie  

   Document your process like you’re the star of your own coming-of-age film. Seriously.  

   Take progress pics, but not just of your body. Take pics of your fridge, your glowing skin, your post-walk coffee. Romanticizing small milestones makes the journey feel rich and meaningful.  

   Neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman explains in his podcast how dopamine isn’t just released when we hit a goal—it spikes when we anticipate rewards. So when you hype up the day’s walk or healthy meal like it’s a plot twist in your movie, your brain literally feels excited about it.  

   No one sticks to something that makes them feel like a robot. So re-frame the process into an aesthetic ritual.  



 Create an identity, not a plan  

   Instead of saying “I need to lose 40lbs,” say “I’m becoming someone who takes care of themselves like it’s sacred.”  

   Research from Stanford psychologist Dr. Carol Dweck on self-concept shows that people are more likely to sustain change when they tie it to identity, not specific results.  

   It’s not about chasing thinness. It’s about becoming the healthiest, happiest version of yourself—and then treating every action as a way to honor that version.  

   Build a playlist called “That Girl,” make a Pinterest board for your dream lifestyle, or write daily little love notes to your future self. It sounds silly, but these visual anchors keep you emotionally connected to your goals.  



 Don’t track everything—romanticize consistency instead  

   People obsess over steps, macros, workout splits. But that kind of micromanagement burns people out.  

   What works better is symbolic consistency—having small, non-negotiable rituals that anchor you.  

   Example: A daily morning walk with a matcha, no matter what. Or cooking dinner while listening to a cozy podcast.  

   BJ Fogg, founder of the Stanford Behavior Design Lab, teaches in Tiny Habits that small routines have massive compounding effects. But only when they’re emotionally tagged as meaningful.  

   You don’t need control. You need rhythm.  



 Build a weight loss environment that feels romantic—not restrictive  

   Leave a fruit bowl out like you’re in a Nancy Meyers movie.  

   Keep a water bottle that feels aesthetic.  

   Grocery shop with a tote bag while listening to jazz.  

   This isn’t cringe. It’s brain science. A study in Health Psychology (2021) showed that visual and sensory cues greatly increase adherence to healthy routines.  

   Don't just change your body. Change your atmosphere.  



This isn’t about tricking yourself. It’s about healing your relationship with food, movement, and your body through joy—not guilt. You won’t stick to anything that feels like a punishment. But if you romanticize the journey, everything changes. Literally everything.



No shame, no tracking apps, no detox drinks. Just you, evolving, in the most aesthetic way possible.

But don't be fooled; everyone is welcome here regardless of age, including your pet. Just make sure your fur babies wear diapers. The café is a neighborhood spot, as most local food outlets in this area of Gil Fernando and its side streets are former residences turned into restaurants, bistros, and cafes.

The owners believed a café should feel like home: warm, inviting, and full of comforting flavors. It should be a place to work with good Wi-Fi, plugs, and coffee. Add unique specialty lattes, matcha blends, fruit drinks, sweet *croffles*, hearty all-day breakfast platters, and creamy or bold pasta meals to go with your cup. 1821 Cafe makes every visit exceptional, whether you're working, meeting friends, or taking a break.

1r88zgw,https://i.redd.it/tlcvtoahdakg1.jpeg,Eames Lounge Chair vs. Plycraft Mr. Chair,"Two iconic mid-century lounge chairs with very different heritages. I bought the Eames a few years back, got to know its virtues and limitations, and wanted to compare it to the Mr. Chair which has often been lauded as the ‘poor man’s Eames’.

I now own both, so… let’s get into it.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

**Eames Lounge Chair (circa 1970s)**

**Original 3rd gen in “Navy Blue” leather**

The first thing you notice sitting in the Eames is the cool tufted leather and the breathy respiration of the urethane foam as it form-fits to your body.  The chair sits low, and the fixed angle recline evokes the feeling of first-class cabin seating at cruising altitude. It’s hard not to immediately *get it*, and understand why this chair has endured.

The two arm rests are cushy, amply spaced and comfortably prop the elbows at navel height.  The chair encourages you to lean your head back and embrace a natal-like posture, and this is where the experience suffers slightly imo…  

The upper backrest pod does not provide true support for the neck or head.  If you’re taller than 5’6” you’ll find yourself slouching to accommodate it, which in turn compromises the ergonomics.  They now make a ‘tall’ version of the Eames, but if you’re after a vintage model, this is a concession you’ll have to accept.

Build quality is high with some caveats.  The 5-ply hardwood construction (7-ply in current production) was novel for its time, but today reads a little closer to what we associate with cheaper manufacturing practices - plywood and glue hidden behind veneers.  Similarly, the foam doesn’t age gracefully and often needs replacement, and the shock mounts tend to fail after a couple decades.  Still, the original chairs have managed to persist over many decades if well-maintained, with the old original leather transforming into deeper, more lustrous hues as it patinas.

The design is iconic and ageless, and yes maybe a \*bit\* overplayed but who cares.  The Eames Lounge is the Platonic ideal of mid-century cool, and in that sense it’ll never go out of style.

Quality: \[8/10\] Comfort: \[8/10\] Aesthetics: \[10/10\]

Price: $6000

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

**Plycraft Mr. Chair (circa 1960s)**

**Orange tufted vinyl**

The Plycraft sits flat and low - so low you could park your bourbon glass on the floor without too much inconvenience.  The elliptical wooden arms are spaced at a wide berth and force your posture into a kind of relaxed bravado.  Your head falls naturally against a small, detachable pillow peached atop the elongated frame.  The vibe is supported, spacious and linear.  If the Eames is a 1st class seat, the Plycraft is the captain’s chair.

The marmalade-orange tufted vinyl is chewy and tacky, but the foam padding is noticeably paltry when compared to the Eames. The sitting experience feels more ‘direct to the frame’ and less forgiving.  The shell is a single layer of walnut plywood heated and forced to form.  The pitted walnut and caramelized shellac show up under your fingertips while seated, and the distinctive wing-shaped armrests make the Plycraft name take on a double meaning.

The quality is good, but it doesn’t have the fit-and-finish of the Eames, nor does it deliver the same “luxury” experience in my view. Still, I’ve found myself gravitating to this chair frequently. It’s a very suitable home for morning coffee or light computer work, and honestly, I just love the way it looks and the vibe it brings to a room.

Quality: \[7/10\] Comfort: \[8/10\] Aesthetics:  \[9/10\]

1r88yt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1r88yt7/800_looking_for_help_parents_are_ready_to_finally/,"[$800] Looking for help -- Parents are ready to finally make the switch from French Press to Espresso, and I'm trying to guide them to the right machine. Roughly an $800 budget, after tax. I've tried to research the wiki and other reddit subs, but I'm getting conflicting information.","Hello everyone,

I stand at the edge of yet another reddit rabbit hole, staring down into its java-filled abyss. 

For all my life, my parents have been huge lovers of Coffee, and are extremely particular in what they like, but have never treated it as a craft. They measure nothing, they pay no mind to water types or parameters, they don't service machines, they pre-grind an entire container of beans, etc. 

As such, their go-to for the past 15 years has been french press coffee. Toss the coffee in, fill it with an indeterminate amount of water, and come back in a few minutes to very strong-tasting coffee. Need stronger flavour to compensate for stale beans? Just add more! 

HOWEVER, they do admit to enjoying espresso-based beverages even more. The coffees my mom truly ***loves*** are americanos made at a few niche cafes around us, and starbucks. As such, my mother has finally started to express a desire to switch to an espresso machine. They will never actually drink espresso shots, though. It will always be Americanos or Cappuccinos.

# As such, I'm trying to find a system for them that meets two basic criteria:

1. Is reliably made, so that it can survive what I know is going to be their less-than-stellar maintenance, until I'm able to drop by and clean it for them, every once in a while.

2. Has systems in place to remove the need to be precise, themselves. So, for example, this would mean grinders that will automatically dose the correct amount, or machines that will supply a consistent amount of water each time, since I know I'm ***never*** going to be able to convince them to use a scale or measure anything out. Volume-based measurements (i.e. using a scoop) are the most I can get them to do. 



# And, in addition to these two essentials, there are two criteria we'd love to somehow realize, in this meager $800 budget

1. Looks good. My parents are not huge fans of [things that look like this](https://ineffablecoffee.com/cdn/shop/files/cafetera-superautomatica-ninja-es701eu-02.webp?v=1758878351&width=1100), with a million dials and knobs and buttons. They are huge fans of machines that look like[ this](https://design-milk.com/images/2024/05/LIGRE-youn-semiauto-espresso-machine-011.jpg), and[ this](https://coffeeaddicts.ca/cdn/shop/files/GaggiaEspressoEvolutionblack.jpg?v=1746151040&width=810), and [this](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rFq1NOoUL.jpg). Minimalism, wood accents, clean design, etc. 

2. Has stainless-steel internals, such that water isn't sitting in or flowing through plastic.



\--



I've read through the Wiki, the FAQ, and some threads across reddit, but I'm getting conflicting info. May people recommend the Breville Bambino and DF54. Other's say to avoid Breville like the plague, buy a Gaggia. Others [feel very strongly ](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/ru0a6e/please_stop_recommending_the_gaggia_classic_pro/)that the Gaggia's shouldn't be recommended to folks like us.  Others recommend a wide array of different machines, etc. etc. 

Any help is recommended, and, for what it's worth, ***If it's a machine carried by William-Sonoma or the West Elm group, that would be even better, as I get 20% off there, so can maximize our dollars. Also, we're in Canada.***

1r88yku,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1r88yku/first_date_unexpected_language_barrier_but_it/,"First date, unexpected language barrier but it went great.  Feel conflicted","The gist is: I(29F) met a guy(27M) through a dating app, and he surprised me by being very new to English— as in, immigrated here a year ago and began practicing it since then.  His profile included photos only, and we barely texted before he asked me if I’d like to get coffee with him.  (Concise and respectful, not pushy at all.)  Because he had two languages listed on his profile, I assumed he spoke both English and his native language proficiently; the city is a melting pot and that wouldn’t have been abnormal here.

When we actually met, it was obvious there was a significant language barrier.  (His English was still impressive to me, for only a year of “lazy” studying!)  He apologized for it and remained very open about it.

Our date went great.  Even though we spent the latter half relying on a translator app, he laughed at a lot of the responses I wrote out and we learned a respectable amount about each other.  It was an unusual experience, but a very fun one.  He’s very respectful and clearly a smart guy, a little quirky and a bit introverted (even in his native language, he says).  He made it clear he wants to see me again, though most of his time right now is spent working his butt off.  

I feel incredibly conflicted because I wasn’t at all prepared for the severity of our language barrier.  It has produced an uncomfortable paranoia that I’d somehow be, like, grooming this guy who’s the same age as me, even if I were to just hang out with him and help him practice English as his new friend.  Whatever he might want from this connection is now ambiguous to me, and this is all something I (literally) don’t know how to discuss with him without coming off super condescending or infantilizing.  

I haven’t gone on many dates and have basically avoided dating seriously for all of my life.  I want to get out of my comfort zone and not squander an interesting connection with a great person, but I also fear the idea of having any kind of weird power dynamic over this guy.  

Maybe I’m in OCD mode, overthinking the hell out of this, or maybe I’m not.  I can’t tell.  I could use some advice from people who have more dating experience",1,1771434880.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

Mother Nature, her creation of the great outdoors is a beautiful and horrifying thing.

It’s beautiful for the views, the experiences, and the adventures it offers.

But it’s also terrifying for those same reasons.

During the day, you feel peaceful and relaxed, knowing everything around you is where it belongs, whether it’s squirrels and chipmunks scampering around and climbing trees, or birds singing their songs and soaring through the skies above.

You know they belong here. You know what they are. You can see them. You might even be able to smell them. And you can definitely hear them.

But what happens when night falls?

That very same place that brought you peace and comfort now brings the unknown, the uncertain. The darkness becomes your only companion, it’s all you can see, and all you know for sure is there.

Now, you want to make it even worse?

Imagine it.

You can’t hear.

Not a single step.

Not the loudest yell.

Not the softest cry.

Not even your own breathing.

Just total and absolute silence.

So the story I'm about to tell you is of my own experiences, you'll learn the truth I did, you’ll know that when you go out into the woods, either at night time or even day time. You can't be afraid to say “Hello”.

About four year's ago. I got an email about a new job listing, I had been on a jobseeker site and would get emails from employers. it was a remote observation post deep in the game lands of the Appalachian Mountains, inside a fenced-off stretch of wilderness, twenty-miles of rugged terrain around a lone cabin, cut off from the world.

Sounds like fun doesn't it. I thought it would be.

It was a one-year contract: head to that cabin by myself, equipped with a radio for checking in with supervisors, and patrol the twenty-mile radius around it. To take notes on what I saw. That meant logging in all animal activity, their movements, numbers, and species, then reporting my findings to the Wildlife Resource Commission, aka my bosses.

I’d also monitor local rivers, small creeks, and ponds for flood hazards that might require notifying the Forestry Service, and keep an eye out for potential wildfires to report immediately.

All that, and I’d get paid more than I’d earned in my dead-end desk job? Yeah, I filled out an application rather quickly and had it sent out within minutes of seeing the listing.

I had grown up in the woods and loved being outdoors, hunting, camping and hiking the whole Nine. so it seemed like an easy gig, a perfect way to escape the mess of my life back home. My marriage had fallen apart six months earlier, leaving me drowning in arguments, legal fees, and a suffocating house full of bad memories. I needed solitude, a reset, something to remind me who I was before all that noise of life. I thought What could go wrong in a quiet cabin surrounded by nature?

After applying for the job. I heard back from the WRC a week later. The lady I spoke with said I would be a great fit for the position and wanted to ask some questions. After a roughly thirty minute interview and tons of questions. she said I have everything it takes for the position and asked if and when I could start.

I told her ""Immediately, if possible.”

She said that was perfect and we set my start date for two days from our convention now. I was given an address for the ranger station near where I’d be stationed.

The woman told me, “You’ll need to meet with Ranger Richardson at 8 a.m. Thursday morning for paperwork and a baggage check for contraband and non-assigned items.”

I interrupted her with a question: “What things can and can’t I bring with me?”

Her response was sassy and sharp ""Sir, if you could take a chill pill and wait, I was about to list them. No need to rush me, so please be patient.”

“Oh, sorry, I jumped the gun, I guess."" I said, laughing harder than I should have.

She responded, seemingly annoyed with me. ""Well, since you just mentioned it, all firearms and weapons are prohibited for employees. No alcohol, no drugs are absolutely not tolerated.

Items like toiletries, clothing, and entertainment are allowed. Food will be delivered every two weeks. Water and power are available at the cabin. You’ll get daily check-ins for any issues and your well-being.”

The restrictions made sense. You don’t want isolated folks in the middle of nowhere getting drunk or high with guns. That could lead to all sorts of trouble.

After going over everything, she starts saying her bye and good luck. But she mentions something I didn't know what to think ""I hope you stay safe and stay warm out there! Tell Rich I said hi and remember Alex, don't forget to say hello out there. Bye!

""Hmm okay I won't. and thanks, bye!""

I thought what she said was odd but didnt think on it to much.

So I got to packing my things, it took about a day and a half to gather everything for i'd need for a whole year. I brought my favorite books and some puzzles to keep me occupied during downtime, plus at least a week’s worth of clothes and shoes for each season.

I woke up early Wednesday morning to start the day. Wanted to make one hundred percent sure I wouldn't forget anything.

The drive to the station From where I lived, it was a solid six-hour drive. So there was no forgetting anything.

I had plan to leave early enough to beat Traffic on Hwy 26 and then get somewhere to sleep that's not to far from the station, so I didn't have to rush to get there the next morning.

After doing my final check. I lock the house up one last good time and check with my neighbors on watching the place for me while I'm gone. I get in my car and head out for the Ranger station, leaving my house in my rear view.

The drive was uneventful and boring. Super long and I was tired from the last day of packing and waking up early this morning. but there’ll be time for sleep later.

On the way, I found a camp ground about thirty minutes from the station. Thankfully no check ins so I was able to just go in and find a spot and get set up for the night. I thankfully got there just before dark, still a little light to set everything up for the night. I didn't wanna do much. I just unloaded a few things from the car and slept in the back in my sleeping bag. I got to bed early, aiming for a good night’s sleep to be ready for the new day ahead, and my new life chapter to begin.

End of Chapter 1.

Chapter 2: Arrival at the Station.

I woke up the next morning early to get cleaned up and get some coffee into my system before heading to meet Ranger Richardson.

There was a bath house by the front gate so I went up there while my coffee brewed.

I brushed my teeth, took a quick shower to kickstart my energy, and got dressed. Once ready, i walked back to my site to get my things packed away into the car and then cleaned up my mess, I ensured everything was back in the car, got my coffee and drove to the station.

I pulled in about five minutes before 8 a.m. and was greeted by a gate guard, who looked as awake as a dead fish. I rolled down my window, and he started his routine.

“Hello and good morning, I’m Ranger Jonah Reese with the Pisgah National Park Rangers. I need to see an I.D. and know your reason for being here.”

He said it all while barely holding his head up, eyes half-open. I handed him my I.D. and replied. “Yeah, I’m the new hire for one of the lookout cabins. I was told to meet with Ranger Richardson for baggage check and paperwork.”

He looked confused but checked my I.D., handed it back, and said. “Oh, okay. Go ahead and park in Zone 4. Good luck out there. Once you’re through the gate to the cabin lands, don’t forget to say ‘Hello’ out there.”

Before I could respond, he retreated into his guard hut and shut the door.

“Hmm, okay? That’s a bit weird,” I thought, but I decided not to dwell on it. What did he mean by ‘through the gate’? Was there something different about the land out there?

I did as he said and parked in Zone #4, found that spot #7 was open. Whipped my car in the spot and put it in park, I grabbed a few things I needed for now out of the car and locked it up, then headed toward the station.

The ranger station sat within a Tall, sturdy chain-link fence, its main gate wide open, with birds chirping and leaves rustling in the breeze, with a lively, normal hum of the woods. Beyond the fence, though a second gate i could see, a sign above marked ‘Cabin 12 Access,’ leading to the trail. It was closed, and the woods beyond it looked....

Off, not as welcoming as the main station. though I couldn’t place why.

Jonah’s words echoed in my head: ‘Say Hello out there.’ Why out there specifically? Was it just a quirky tradition, or was there something about that fenced-off area that made it matter? I shook off the thought, figuring I’d find out soon enough.

I approached the main door and wiggled the knob and noticed it was unlocked, and assuming they expected me, I didn’t knock, I just walked in.

“Hello? New hire, I'm here for—”

Before I could finish, a guy with undone pants, no shirt, and no shoes, looking half-asleep, screamed. “Hey, didn’t your momma teach you how to knock!”

Now fully awake, he glared at me. I screamed back. “Oh my god, I’m so sorry!”

I slammed the door behind me and stepped away, trying to compose myself from the awkward first impression.

After a couple of minutes, the same guy came out fully dressed except for his shoes, which he carried in one hand along with a coffee in the other.

Wanting to apologize without making it more embarrassing, I said.

“Hey, I’m sorry for barging in. I thought it was just an office or welcome area. Didn’t expect anyone to be… like that.”

He sat at a picnic table outside the station, he lit a cigarette, took a drag, and gave me a groggy, unamused stare. “Knock before you enter, anywhere. I’m at least glad you made sure to say ‘Hello’ and started explaining yourself. If not for that, I probably would’ve come at you, and lord knows how that would’ve gone. No offense, just think next time. I also haven’t introduced myself yet. I’m Ranger Josh Richardson, second in command here at Outpost Chance of the Pisgah National Park. Pleased to meet you, uh…?”

“Oh, I’m Alex. Pleased to meet you, Josh. You’re the Ranger Richardson I’m supposed to meet?”

He finished lacing his boots, put out his first cig and took another sip of coffee. “No, that’ll be my father, John ‘Rich’ Richardson. He's on the phone with the head of Outpost Glory, our neighbor station. he was talking about a fire in the next county over.”

He then lit another cigarette. “He’ll be off soon. It’s a fire we shouldn’t have to handle, but we need the heads-up just in case.”

Taking a drag while eyeing me up and down, he asked, “What made you wanna come out here? Why this job?”

I was confused. I’m a bit on the smaller side, but I didn’t look like some city slicker playing country.

“I grew up around woods my whole life and needed time away from normal life, you know? The pay didn’t hurt either, so I figured why not. Why do you ask?”

He stared at the ground, and said

“Just didn’t seem the type. No offense. Just stick to the rules out there, especially once you’re past the gate. That ‘Hello’ thing? Don’t skip it. Last guy who did… let’s just say he didn’t stick around long.” He smirked, but his eyes flicked nervously toward the closed gate leading to the cabin trail.

I frowned, waiting for more, but he clammed up. Why was everyone so fixated on saying ‘Hello’? And why only past the gate? Was it some kind of signal, or was there something out there in that 20-mile stretch that needed to hear it? The way Josh’s voice tightened made it sound like more than a joke, and it left a knot in my stomach.

I flashed a fake smile and nodded.

""None taken. I get that a lot. But discs can handle myself out here, or at least we’ll see.”

He looked at me like I was the most naive kid he’d ever met. “Yeah. We’ll see, bud.”

After a few minutes of small talk with Josh, Ranger Richardson came out the door. A tall, authoritative figure with a clean cowboy hat. He looked at Josh and said,

""Jesus, boy, could you have kept it down earlier? You Interrupted my call with Leigh! But anyhow. who might you be, young man?”

Did anyone know I was coming? I guess they must’ve forgotten. But Josh answered before I could. “This little turd is the reason I screamed. This is the new hire for Cabin 12, name is Alex. He's the reason for my scream, he didn’t knock and just decided to come right inside. So thanks for mentioning he was coming, there Pops.”

Ranger Richardson gave Josh a classic dad glare. “Ah yes. Well Josh, I wasn’t expecting to be on the phone for as long as I was, and I wasn’t expecting you up before he got here. So hush your lip up. Need I remind you that you’re only here because of me and can leave because of me.”

Then he turned to me with a warm smile. “Sorry for not being down here sooner, work never stops. I was in the phone with Leigh, The head of Outpost Glory in the County to our west, his crew so otted a small wildfire starting about two miles from our lines. It should be handled by them, but we still needed to be notified in case it came closer our way.""

He then chuckled and began to say.

""I haven’t introduced myself yet.  I’m Ranger Johnathan Richardson, the head of Outpost Chance. Pleased to meet you, Alex.” He extended his hand, and I shook it, nearly crushing mine. This man had calluses from a lifetime in the woods, no soft hands here.

He released my hand, waved me to follow, and said, “Come inside, let’s get coffee and go over some things. Mind if Josh checks your things for contraband and unloads your things from your car while we talk?”

“Yeah, that’s fine. Everything’s in the trunk. anything in the back seats or front can stay. Here’s the key.”

I handed the key to Josh and then followed Ranger Richardson. He looked at Josh and said, “Be careful with his stuff, boy, and load it on the cart properly, weight in the front, got it? No judging his things.”

Josh shot back, “If I find a dildo or anything like that while looking, I’m making a joke about it.”

I looked at Josh and quipped, “I have a count on them all, so I’ll know if one’s missing.”

Ranger Richardson laughed as we walked in. We get inside and I sat down at kitchen table, He poured me coffee, then sits down across from me. We begin to discuss the job and go over safety protocols. We talked for over an hour about routines, patrol routes, supplies, bi-weekly food drops (with requests allowed), and the equipment at the cabin.

“The radio is one of your most important tools,” he said, holding out a military-style handheld with a long antenna, large strap, and contact list taped to the back. Multiple batteries with charger.

""if you lose it, you can’t reach us if you’re hurt or lost. Keep it on you.

There’s a computer for submitting your daily reports, send them to headquarters and my myself. There's a few old games on it too in case you get bored. There'll be Flashlights, matches, lighters, all the cooking gear you need, and everything else needed for your day to day life is there. Any Questions?”

Knowing I had my essentials and they’d provide food and water. There is one thing he hasn't mentioned, that I was curious about.

""Is there anything for protection at the cabin? A knife? Even a can of Bear spray?""

He chuckled. “Yes, there'll be a survival knife, our main issued tool. Then there’ll be an Axe and a Machete, used for clearing trails in the Area. Then the last resort, a pump-action 12 gauge in a safe with enough shells for three or four bears. The code is kept here at the station and is only given out in case of emergencies. So you'll need to get ahold of us here for to get in. But you have options. Use them as needed. Any other questions?”

Only one more I could think of:

“What’s so important about saying ‘Hello’? Both Jonah and Josh mentioned-""

Before I finished, he slammed his hand onto the table and stared me down.

“Just do it. No matter what. Whenever you enter somewhere, always say ‘Hello.’ Just do it and don’t forget.”

He narrowed his eyes, with a stern look.

""Do I make myself clear, son?”

Of everything so far, I've kept a cool head. But I would be lying if I said, he didn't scare me a little during this. I probably showed some nervousness, maybe even some fear. but I replied;

""Yes, sir. Crystal clear. Understood.”

He softened his look at him, smiling warmly. “Good to hear. Now, let’s see how Josh is doing with your bag check and we'll get you on your way. You have a Long walk ahead.”

After we walk outside, we see Josh was finishing my last bag inspection and loading a pull-behind cart with my things.

Ranger Richardson whispered to me, “Watch this,” then asked Josh.

""Boy, you done inspecting and loading his stuff? Or do I need to come over there and kick your ass a bit to speed things up?”

They both laughed.

Josh said, “Yeah, the cart’s loaded and good to go. And Everything he brought has approved, I found nothing questionable.”

Ranger Richardson chuckled.

""Good. Now go get to work on something else; I’ll send him off.”

Josh said his byes for now to me and then headed back inside.

Ranger Richardson handed me a map and compass, explaining the route: “You’ll head out through the Cabin 12 gate here. From there, follow this trail to a fork not far out, take a left, then go about seven miles. You'll pass some field, a few open wooded areas, and You will pass a creek with a small bridge. Once you’ve reached there, you’re almost home. If you get lost, Radio in if needed. Report anything of interest or concern. Understood?”

I nodded, took the items, and prepped for my hike. “Thank you for the introduction and advice, Ranger Richardson.”

His face hardened briefly, then smirked. “That’s Rich, son. No need to be too formal with me.""

“Yes, sir, Mr. Rich. Sorry, I can’t shake my manners.”

He shook my hand, nodded. “All good. Good luck out there. And remember, past that gate, don’t forget to say ‘Hello’ out there.”

Still unsure and worried for what will happen if I don't, I agreed and said.

“Yes, sir. I'll do my best.""

We parted ways, and I headed toward the Cabin 12 gate to start my year-long adventure and life. or that's what I thought, for the adventure i had been day dreaming about, turned into an absolute nightmare.

This may not be true for everyone, but I’m slowly recognising that sometimes my “symptoms” and reactions are my body telling me to pay closer attention. My ex did not show me much care or understanding during my episodes and never accommodated me, i.e. still offer coffee and alcohol despite knowing how it affects me; he did not feel like a real partner in any sense and I allowed myself to go crazy thinking it was all in my head.

**My [23F] boyfriend [23M] of 3 years is using Tinder, claiming to be 'looking for friends and hangouts'.**

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!Infidelity, gaslighting!<

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/3MAX3cwrnk)  **Aug 29, 2015**

A (single) friend called me a couple of days ago asking me if I knew that Dave (bf) was using Tinder, despite being with me for the last 3 years, and living together and happily planning an engagement. I was distraught, knowing what tinder is and what it is used for, I was heartbroken. 

She goes on to tell me that his Bio says he's ""Looking to make some new, exciting and fun friends and looking to hangout. Willing to travel a little if there's enough excitement involved!""

His pictures do not include me, despite 9/10 pictures ever taken of either of us for the last three years having the two of us together in them. One of his pictures is him at the beach, shirtless and a tiny man thong I got him as a joke. He cropped me out of the image.

I brought this up to him, and he laughed it off, saying that 1: my best friend of 11 years is a 'nosy bitch' and that 2: he's entitled to seek friends and be social, even if it is with complete strangers. Basically he completely invalidated my points and made *me* feel guilty for being upset by this, playing it off like I am being possessive. 

Since then I've avoided bringing it up and just tried to get over it. He hasn't been out and about any more than usual so it doesn't look like he has any 'takers' yet, but this is just *not* sitting right with me. I'm upset and feeling betrayed, and I don't know how to put my point across without him invalidating it or guilting me.

What can I do? Am I in the wrong for not being OK with this? I do not want to throw away three years over something that might be ME being silly.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/gC3WKOYsjk)  **Same Day**

Edit: Firstly, thank all of you for all of your perspectives and advice in this quite frankly disgusting situation I've found myself in.

I decided I'd play dirty as someone suggested and made a tinder profile, pretending to be a friend (with her permission!) whom he does not know. I hit on him. He reciprocated and made plans to meet with 'me' at a nearby coffee shop that we occasionally date at, minutes after making 'my' intentions clear. Wow.

In about 20 minutes he'll be headed out to go and meet 'me' and I'll be packing up his shit ready for him to leave when he gets back. House is my families, he has no rights to any of it.

I deserve better.

**Update 2 posted the next day Aug 30, 2015**

Edit/Update 2:

He sat at the coffee place waiting for 'her/me' for over an hour in the hopes to meet my, to be honest, gorgeous friend. Obviously she didn't show up.

Shortly after he left I called my dad to explain, and I must have sounded pretty distraught because he came over without me asking. Dave came home to his clothes packed up by the door. He came in yelling ""what the fuck is this?"" and, unbeknownst to him, my dad was sat by me on the sofa and responded on my behalf, telling him in no certain words to get his filthy unfaithful ass out of his house. I am glad he did. I think my dad knows I'm timid and prone to being pushed about.

His face dropped when he pieced it together and without a word he 180'd and grabbed his bags. I know he has places he can stay, and family nearby, so I'm not worried about him having no place to sleep. 

This is going to hurt for a long time, but I can never forgive that kind of breach of trust. I'm not the type of person to move past it. I'll allow him back to collect his pieces of furniture and such in a week or so when he is situated, but that's as far as seeing him again goes. I am also dreading a phone call from his mother, whom I love dearly. She'll be heartbroken too. 

Welp, bye bye three years. Fuck you Dave! :')

1r88tb1,https://i.redd.it/csqwvrabcakg1.jpeg,Eames Lounge Chair vs. Plycraft Mr. Chair,"Two iconic mid-century lounge chairs with very different heritages. I bought the Eames a few years back, got to know its virtues and limitations, and wanted to compare it to the Mr. Chair which has often been lauded as the ‘poor man’s Eames’.

I now own both, so… let’s get into it.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

**Eames Lounge Chair (circa 1970s)**

**Original 3rd gen in “Navy Blue” leather**

The first thing you notice sitting in the Eames is the cool tufted leather and the breathy respiration of the urethane foam as it form-fits to your body.  The chair sits low, and the fixed angle recline evokes the feeling of first-class cabin seating at cruising altitude. It’s hard not to immediately *get it*, and understand why this chair has endured.

The two arm rests are cushy, amply spaced and comfortably prop the elbows at navel height.  The chair encourages you to lean your head back and embrace a natal-like posture, and this is where the experience suffers slightly imo…  

The upper backrest pod does not provide true support for the neck or head.  If you’re taller than 5’6” you’ll find yourself slouching to accommodate it, which in turn compromises the ergonomics.  They now make a ‘tall’ version of the Eames, but if you’re after a vintage model, this is a concession you’ll have to accept.

Build quality is high with some caveats.  The 5-ply hardwood construction (7-ply in current production) was novel for its time, but today reads a little closer to what we associate with cheaper manufacturing practices - plywood and glue hidden behind veneers.  Similarly, the foam doesn’t age gracefully and often needs replacement, and the shock mounts tend to fail after a couple decades.  Still, the original chairs have managed to persist over many decades if well-maintained, with the old original leather transforming into deeper, more lustrous hues as it patinas.

The design is iconic and ageless, and yes maybe a \*bit\* overplayed but who cares.  The Eames Lounge is the Platonic ideal of mid-century cool, and in that sense it’ll never go out of style.

Quality: \[8/10\] Comfort: \[8/10\] Aesthetics: \[10/10\]

Price: $6000

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

**Plycraft Mr. Chair (circa 1960s)**

**Orange tufted vinyl**

The Plycraft sits flat and low - so low you could park your bourbon glass on the floor without too much inconvenience.  The elliptical wooden arms are spaced at a wide berth and force your posture into a kind of relaxed bravado.  Your head falls naturally against a small, detachable pillow peached atop the elongated frame.  The vibe is supported, spacious and linear.  If the Eames is a 1st class seat, the Plycraft is the captain’s chair.

The marmalade-orange tufted vinyl is chewy and tacky, but the foam padding is noticeably paltry when compared to the Eames. The sitting experience feels more ‘direct to the frame’ and less forgiving.  The shell is a single layer of walnut plywood heated and forced to form.  The pitted walnut and caramelized shellac show up under your fingertips while seated, and the distinctive wing-shaped armrests make the Plycraft name take on a double meaning.

The quality is good, but it doesn’t have the fit-and-finish of the Eames, nor does it deliver the same “luxury” experience in my view. Still, I’ve found myself gravitating to this chair frequently. It’s a very suitable home for morning coffee or light computer work, and honestly, I just love the way it looks and the vibe it brings to a room.

Me and Ellie have been friends for just under 5 years-- We met in a coffee shop where we started talking to each other as we were the only ones in there and it developed into a full blown friendship when we realised we had some stuff in common and both lived near to each other. She's a really kind and sweet friend, and we have the same kind of politics and personal opinions on things, we both have similar life experiences and struggles so we get on really well. But over the years I've noticed a few things that have snowballed into a big thing that's put me on edge and made me kind of uncomfortable in continuing the friendship. 

For one, despite having spoken about my lack of attraction to her and not wanting to actually date her at length in the past, she still seems to hold a flame for me and sometimes pushes boundaries by flirting with me or playing coy and pushing me into situations I don't want to be in. For example, she will do subtle things like compliment me (really intensely) or get kind of touchy with me. I've told her in the past that I don't like that and she stops and pulls back but then slowly begins doing it again. The thing is, I truly do not believe she is trying her luck or coercing me, I really think she just thinks enough time has passed that things have changed. In the times where she's not flirting with or being touchy with me, she goes through a cycle where she meets another woman and instantly approaches getting to know them with the intention of dating them. 

  
Secondly, and this is why I think she does the first thing I mentioned, is I think she has reduced mental capacity/reduced competence. It's a massive strain on our friendship (for me at least, she doesn't seem to notice it at all). 

\- She doesn't retain a lot of information. She forgets important days, forgets important information, doesn't understand information that our age is expected to understand and retain. 

\- She struggles with simple tasks, like house cleaning/food preparation (the mental elements of planning to do these things rather than the physicality), and 

\-Doesn't seem to have the full ability to make decisions on a lot of things, and constantly asks for support on things that most people can manage on their own.

Less important but she also doesn't seem to pick up on when someone she's speaking to is much younger than her -- from behaviour or appearance or both-- which leads into issues where she will meet someone, flirt with them, and then find out they're 10 years younger than her (tying into the first point I made above)

 When we first met, we both knew we were disabled, but as time has gone by either her competency has worsened or she's just no longer hiding it because she feels comfortable around me but either way, it's a lot to deal with. I feel like I'm expected to be her carer at times because she cannot do a lot of things on her own that many other people don't struggle with, and it results in me not wanting to invite her to things that I've set up or been invited to & given a +1 to. This makes me feel even worse because on top of all this, I am her only close friend in real life-- she has a fair few close friends online but I'm the only one she sees regularly and spends a lot of time with. Because of said (perceived) mental incapacity, she spends a lot of time in her flat and doesn't tend to go to social events.

  
I don't want to be friends with her anymore, but I don't know how to navigate ending the friendship without hurting her. She doesn't deserve to be upset and be hurt because of her mental incapacity, but I also cannot handle being her carer. There's so much more that happens but this isn't really the place-- what I want is advice on how to end this. Do I tell her? Surely that feels evil to do? But also ending the friendship without telling her feels worse? I've actually tried distancing myself in the past but it doesn't really ever pan out partly because of me and partly because of her (again, not understanding that I'm trying to pull away)

  
TL;DR My friend of 4-5 years who's the same age as me seems to have reduced capacity in thinking and decision making and I don't want to be friends anymore because accounting for that is causing me immense stress, how do I go about ending things with her without hurting her?",1,1771434491.0,relationships,9,0.56,False

\\\*\\\*I've been getting some lovely messages from international ace's.  As I'm looking for something IRL please kindly only reply/DM if you're in the UK thank you.\\\*\\\*

I seem to be one of the older folks around here, but thought I'd give this a try.  As the title says I'm 42 from the UK and would love to find a partner to enjoy life with.  In terms of my aceishness (not a word, but I'm running with it), I'm sex indifferent, but also consider myself kink positive, but I think that's a more private conversation for down the line.  On the flip side I can consider myself to be extremely romantic and love a good cuddle.

I work in tech (like every other Redditor it seems) and that keeps me very busy, but I find myself really lonely in my spare time, hence this post.  In terms of hobbies and interests I'm a huge lover of cinema, bit of a foodie, big reader (big interest in psychology) and I love my sci-fi, oh and coffee is my main vice.  I like to get out in nature especially if there's a cosy pub at the end of the hike.

What else?  I love animals especially dogs but don't have one at the moment unfortunately, I've dealt with my fair share of challenges in my life, but like to think that I've generally remained a positive person i.e. I've become a better more considered person despite said challenges.  

Feel free to say hello, while ultimately I'm looking for a partner I don't consider new friends a consolation prize.

If you have any ideas, I’m open to suggestions.

It all started almost a month ago. I was finishing up some work, shut down my computer, and got ready for bed. Brushed my teeth, put on my pajamas, and turned on a nature documentary at low volume. I set the sleep timer and tried to fall asleep. A few minutes later, the TV turned off, but I still couldn’t sleep. Must’ve been the coffee I had earlier to finish my work.

I started thinking about what I’d done, what I might’ve forgotten. I realized I still hadn’t paid the internet bill and the due date was coming up. I was about to grab my phone to watch some funny videos when I heard a strangely familiar noise: a boom.

Probably the neighbors, I thought. Or an animal outside—a cat, maybe. But then it happened again. Boom. Nothing crazy, just the sound of something hitting the floor. This time it was clearer: it was coming from inside the house.

I looked around for a weapon. The closest thing I had was my camera tripod. I grabbed it as aggressively as I could and headed to the living room. Another boom. I walked slowly, holding my breath, tensing my arms. I might have to hit someone.

When I got to the living room, I saw the source of the noise: a rubber ball. No bigger than an apple. It bounced off the floor again. Boom. I carefully set the tripod down by the couch and went to the kitchen. I needed water. I turned on the faucet, filled a glass. Another boom.

I walked back and just stood there, watching the ball, one hand on my hip, drinking water. It kept bouncing. Boom. It would rise almost to shoulder height and fall again. Boom. A chill ran through me. I caught it mid-air and set it on the dining table on my way back to the bedroom.

Finished my water, got back in bed. Didn’t hear it again that night. Figured it was just a weird episode.

The next morning, I looked for the ball, wanted to see if it was something special. Couldn’t find it. Went to work, life went on. That night, I tried to sleep early—actually managed to doze off—until it woke me up. Boom.

Same sound. Just a bounce. I stared at the ceiling. Boom. I didn’t want to get up. Couldn’t be bothered. Boom. Shit. Got up, went to the living room, grabbed the ball, and threw it out the window. Went back to bed and fell asleep.

Next day was normal. I told Fred about it. He gave me this weird look, like I was joking. I dropped it. Maybe it was just a bad dream. Went home, tried to sleep, and while I was asleep: boom. I checked the time. 12:35 AM. Got pissed. What kind of sick prank is this?

""I don’t care who you are, this isn’t funny.""

Grabbed the ball, took it to my room, and put it in the nightstand. Next morning, it was gone.

The following night, I invited Fred and his wife Lina over. Poker, drinks. We were in the dining room playing when, right at 12:35, boom. I didn’t say anything. Wanted to see his reaction.

Fred looked at me, confused.

""What’s that sound?""

""It’s the ball. The thing I told you about.""

He gave me this look—almost pity. Then another boom. His expression shifted to mild annoyance. We all went to the living room. There it was. The ball, bouncing almost shoulder-high.

""This isn’t funny, man. You’re going too far.""

He grabbed Lina’s hand and they left without another word. The ball bounced again. Boom.

I grabbed it and threw it out the window as hard as I could. Cleaned up the table and went to bed. At least now I knew I wasn’t hallucinating.

The nights kept going like that. Every single night, exactly at 12:35, the bounce. Boom. I bought earplugs. Didn’t matter. The sound cut right through them. Boom. Boom. Boom.

I tried getting rid of it. Threw it in the trash. Threw it in the river. Gave it away. It always came back. Thought maybe it was the house. Called a priest. He did an exorcism, told me to pray. I did. Thought it would work. That night, right at 12:35, the goddamn ball was back. Boom.

Got a hotel room. Maybe it was the house. Everything was fine—until 12:35. Boom. The ball, bouncing in the hallway.

Went to a witch. She said it was a curse. Charged me a month’s salary to lift it. I paid. Thought it was over. That night, 12:35. Boom.

I snapped. Grabbed the ball, took it to the kitchen, picked up the sharpest knife I had, and cut it to pieces. Wanted to see if there was something inside. There was nothing. I threw the pieces into the fireplace and lit it. Watched it burn. Caught a faint smell of iron. Doused the fire, scooped up the ashes, and tossed them.

Went to sleep.

Next day, my boss fired me. Said I’d been missing too much work. Terrible day. That night, I couldn’t sleep. And at 12:35, the ball bounced again. Boom.

Went to Fred the next day. Tried to explain, tried to stay calm, tried to make him understand.

""I know it sounds crazy. Please, believe me.""

He invited me over. Tried to make it nice, told old stories from when we were kids. We were laughing, having drinks, when at 12:35, the ball bounced in the next room. This time, Fred’s face went pale. Real horror. I started walking toward it. He stopped me. Just stood there, watching it bounce.

""This is impossible.""

He waved his hands around it, looking for strings. Nothing. I grabbed it.

""I’ve tried everything.""

""I’m sorry.""

I went back home in the early morning, tried to sleep. Fred hasn’t called me since. I’ve tried calling him. He doesn’t answer.

i'm traveling solo to london for about 2 weeks in may. i was hoping my friends would join but the dates i planned for just didn't work for them. the thought of being along in a foreign place scares me but i've heard london is pretty safe, and if i wait around for everyone else to be ready i fear i'll never go anywhere.

i've been working on an itinerary for awhile but i always end up completely overwhelmed. with that said, i was hoping to hear from locals or even those who have passed through about what is and isn't worth visiting? i do actually love doing all of the touristy things.

a few of my favorite activities are visiting black historic sites, museums, thrifting/shopping, dining out/coffee shops, theater, gothic/victorian literature/architecture, cinema, women's literature, libraries, and gardens. even if you think of something that may not be my thing but you really love it, i'd be interested to hear. i'll try anything once.

Andy Makes a Big Decision!","[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1qqss55/paradise_delayed_chapter_1_a_young_man_dies_in_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1r7bdwd/paradise_delayed_chapter_19_dissidents/) | Next

Gerran sat in his small, unorganized study, looking through his financial records, doing the math once again while taking a bite of a juicy red apple. His gym was staying afloat, but only barely, and mostly because of the donations of the Valehammer family. If it weren’t for that fact, Patesh Valehammer would’ve been expelled a long time ago.

Gerran sighed. He wasn’t running a bad business, but he had hoped for more dramatic success by now. He had hoped that the Firebrand Gym would be able to sponsor a school house, an orphanage, a medical clinic… all those institutions that had made Gerran’s childhood possible after his parents’ young death.

He had avoided becoming an initiate in the Order of the Behemoth only because he thought he could make a bigger impact by pursuing private projects. With the gym, he made the biggest ideological impact he could, especially among the noble-born. He tried his best to instill in them a love for their fellow citizens, regardless of class.

And the only reason he could get away with it was because he was a damn good **Fighter**, and an even better teacher. If he couldn’t become independently wealthy with a fighting gym, at least he could try to spread some common sense to the upper class. It was becoming harder, though, in the face of growing discontent among the nobility.

He had never considered shuttering the gym before, but he had to admit he was discouraged. How long would this project last? Another year or two?

He sighed and dropped the papers back on his desk, stretching and heading outside.

Two of his students, Patesh and Quinn, sparred casually in the outdoor gym. A few other students, approaching the end of their training, sat on the sidelines. They’d be moved out in a day or two, and Patesh and Quinn would remain.

“Keep your form up!” he called to Quinn.

Quinn was a relatively level-headed individual, and he’d make a solid **Fighter**. Patesh, though… Was he even getting through to him? He was a uniquely stubborn and irascible student.

Gerran tried to remind himself that no one was beyond hope, but the sentiment rang hollow when it came to Patesh.

The arrival of the new Visitor, though, had been intriguing. At Morwen’s Grove, Gerran had witnessed this new Andy fellow, with zero progression in the system save for a rank of **\[athletics\]**. The kid’s talent impressed him. He was a quick learner who seemed to have a cool head. By Morwen’s accounts, he seemed sympathetic to the Order’s values, too.

Gerran had extended the invitation to Morwen for the Visitor to train at the Firebrand, and he hoped she and Andy would accept it.

\*\*\*

Andy awoke early. He was nervous about his **\[martial weapons\]** test, though he didn’t know why… He had completed the forms and drills just fine, and Morwen had been nothing but complimentary. He knew he could count on her mentorly criticism if he needed it. But he remembered from his **\[combat\]** training not to presume his own success…

He considered, again, the question Morwen had put to him the night before. Should he go into the city to train with Gerran for his second ranks in **\[athletics\]**, **\[combat\]**, and **\[martial weapons\]**?

He was leaning towards a ‘yes.’ As much as he felt at home in Morwen’s Grove, and as much as he adored Morwen as a teacher, and as much as he enjoyed the company of Pliny and Noel… he had to admit, he was getting a little restless. He needed some excitement, a little change of pace.

He split wood and fed the fire in the den before sitting down with coffee. He decided to open the book Morwen had let him borrow:

>*The Virtues*

>*By Archscholar Barthes Romanes*

>*Preface*

>*Virtues are characteristics of the mind and heart that make right action both easy and pleasurable. Without guidance from reason, the soul tends toward short-term gratifications, which can cause undesirable outcomes in life, and moreover, prevents the individual from attaining happiness. With training and discipline in reason, anyone can develop virtues, which, at the end of the day, are the one and only key to a happy life. In this volume, Archscholar Barthes Romanes explores relevant virtues as well as strategies for developing them.*

>*“Those who attain virtue attain everything, for though they have nothing, they are content in their virtue. Those who fail to attain virtue fail to attain anything, for though they have everything, they are discontented in their vice.”*

Andy pondered over the passage, sipping his coffee. He had made it halfway through the first page, and he was already thinking carefully about what it meant… He closed the book.

*Too heavy for this morning*, he thought.

He picked up an easier tome, *Minor Monsters of the Cresthaven Region*, and opened it up to the index.

*Maybe I can find some information on trolls in here… see what Noel was up against*, he thought.

He scanned the index and found it, flipping to the corresponding page. He saw a shockingly fearsome illustration of a giant. The human form drawn for size comparison came up only to the troll’s mid-thigh.

The creature wore a loin cloth and carried a giant club over his shoulder. He had tusk-like teeth, jutting from his lower jaw, and a single horn, like a rhinoceros, jutting from his forehead between his small eyes.

Andy didn’t even need to read the description.

*He defeated seven of them? Noel must be a formidable fighter…*

As if on cue, footsteps resounded up the steps in rapid succession. “It’s here! It’s here!” Noel cried as he emerged into the den.

Morwen appeared, climbing down the ladder quickly. “What’s going on?” she asked.

“My payment has arrived! It’s in the yard!”

The three of them made their way out to the yard.

“Holy shit,” Andy said as they crossed out onto the porch.

Pliny was already on the veranda, scratching his head.

In the yard, there was a burly man with a wagon drawn by two muscular oxen. The wagon was filled to the brim with treasure chests, heaps of gold, and an array of weapons, some of them glowing faintly.

“Where should I put it?” The man said.

“I suppose put it in the… bunk room?” Morwen said, her mouth still agape in astonishment.

Andy, Morwen, Pliny, Noel, and the wagoneer spent about half an hour unloading the treasure into the bunk room. Andy moved several heavy chests, filled to the brim with gold, jewels, and valuable-looking trinkets. He also took several armfuls of swords, spears, shields, bows, hammers and axes, some made of gold, some made of silver, some incredibly light, some incredibly heavy.

Aside from the bunks occupied by Noel, Pliny, and Andy, and the bunk they had reserved for Yarel’s return, all of the beds and much of the floors were covered in treasure.

\*\*\*

The four of them, Andy, Morwen, Pliny, and Noel, sat on the porch. It was midmorning, and the air was still cool.

“Before we devote more attention to sorting out the treasure situation, I suppose we should take care of Andy’s **\[martial weapons\]** test, eh?” Noel said.

“Yes, yes we should,” Morwen said.

The whole group of them had been a bit shellshocked. The horde of wealth that had just poured into Morwen’s residence was several decades’ worth of wages, even for a well-paid **Fighter**.

“Andy, don’t disappoint us,” Pliny said. He then turned to Morwen, “I told the lad that I want to take him into the city. Could we make that happen soon?”

“As a matter of fact, we can,” Morwen said. “Andy, have you given thought about whether you want to pursue further studies with Gerran?”

“I have,” Andy said. “I think it’s a good idea.”

“Good,” Morwen said. “We’ll miss you around here, but it’ll be good for you. Plus, you’ll be back in no time.”

“Gerran, huh?” Pliny said.

“Yes,” said Morwen. “He can return to us for his third-rank training, but I think it’s important for him to gain exposure to a variety of teaching styles, and to a variety of environments.”

“When will I go?” Andy said.

“Well,” Morwen said, “last I spoke to Gerran, he had an opening on Friday, giving you three days to do what you will in between.”

“Oh, excellent,” Pliny said.

“Excellent, indeed,” Noel echoed.

“Ah, I can’t wait to show you Tobston,” Pliny said. “My favorite little outskirt. Amazing food, and a good gaming hall.” He rubbed his hands together and licked his lips, perhaps subconsciously.

Andy smiled. A day of entertainment in the city actually sounded like a welcome break to him.

“But enough of this,” Morwen said, “we can get details locked down later… let’s conduct your test. Andy, are you ready?”

“Yes,” Andy said, standing up from his chair.

Morwen descended the stairs and Andy followed. His forms and drills raced through his mind again. He recalled each movement he would have to make in the coming moments. It was nothing too complicated, but each move in his forms had to be precise, and he would need to handle his drills well.

“Staff first,” Morwen said, gesturing to the staff leaning against the tree.

Andy walked over to it and picked it up, returning to the center of the yard where they had drilled in the days prior.

Morwen stood in the center of the yard, directly before Andy. Pliny and Noel remained on the porch, sitting in their rockers, legs resting against the railing.

“Present your staff,” Morwen said.

Andy held his staff in front of him in a horizontal position.

“Deliver your form,” she said, stepping back and folding her arms in front of her chest. Her face was stoic and impartial as she observed his movements.

Andy closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He moved through the motions he had learned just a couple of days prior. He had practiced them again and again, so they came to him naturally. He kept his strikes precise, and his posture impeccable. Even after moving several hundred pounds of treasure that morning, he still retained perfect muscle memory. He even nailed the roll at the end.

He stood up and delivered the final strike of his form.

A quiet round of applause, appropriate for a golf course, came from the veranda.

“Well done!” Morwen said.

Pliny and Noel muttered words of approval to each other.

Morwen picked up her staff. “Now, let’s drill defense,” she said. She approached him and nodded.

Andy did the same.

Suddenly, Morwen launched a flurry of attacks from above, from the sides, and straight ahead. The blows were fast, but not overly forceful.

Andy deftly blocked and parried each one.

Another round of polite claps issued from the veranda behind Andy.

“Your defense is solid,” Morwen said, taking her place again at the center of the yard. Andy could tell that she had to work hard to mask the pride on her face. She couldn’t show too much partiality, not in the middle of an evaluation. “Now, let’s drill attacks.”

They both gave one another a silent nod of agreement. The drill began.

Andy lunged forward, bringing his staff down toward Morwen’s shoulder, then up toward her ribs, then he jabbed straight ahead.

She met each blow with a block herself. “Well done,” she said. “Excellent form.”

The two spectators clapped again.

“Not bad!” Pliny called.

“Not bad at all!” said Noel.

“Switch weapons, please,” Morwen said, switching her staff for a shortsword.

Andy leaned his staff against the tree and retrieved his shortsword, sheathed in the plain leather scabbard. He unsheathed it and stood before Morwen.

“Please, demonstrate your forms,” she said.

Andy went through the motions of the shortsword form, aiming for utter precision with each move. He had memorized the exact angles at which to slash, the exact positions his wrists ought to be, how it felt to thrust forward in the correct way. Every move was perfect, especially the roll at the end.

“Outstanding!” Pliny called as the two on the veranda clapped, their applause growing more intense with each successful demonstration that Andy gave.

“Very nice job,” said Morwen. “Now, finally, let’s drill your shortsword defenses and attacks.”

Morwen approached him with her sword drawn. “Defenses first. Ready?”

Andy nodded.

Morwen moved in slowly, then pounced. She slashed down from the left, from above, from the right, and finished with a jab forward.

Andy caught each blow, blocking across himself, holding his sword above him, blocking outside, and parrying the jab downward as he stepped out of the way.

Morwen had been quick with her movements, perhaps even quicker than she had been with the staff, but she kept the force of her attacks light to prevent unnecessary injuries.

“Excellent,” Morwen said as an increasingly raucous applause continued on the porch. “Now, let’s finish by drilling your attacks,” she said.

They faced each other and began.

Andy launched a series of strikes. He thrust forward, slashed from the right shoulder down, slashed from the left shoulder down, and launched an overhead attack, each of them met by Morwen’s light parries.

They disengaged from the drill as Pliny and Noel clapped heartily.

“Yes,” Pliny called. “Great form!”

Morwen smiled broadly. “Well?” she asked, looking to Pliny and Noel. “What do you think?”

“Pass him!” Pliny said.

“Pass him indeed!” said Noel.

“I agree,” Morwen said, looking back to Andy. She no longer hid her beaming pride. “Excellent work, friend,” she said, extending her hand.

Andy shook it, unable to suppress the grin on his face.

1r88jwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/toxicmothers/comments/1r88jwt/do_i_cut_contact_with_my_mom_or_try_to_reach_out/,"Do I cut contact with my mom, or try to reach out to her?","So I've cut out A LOT of context cause this story is just too long. But to add a little background, almost 4 years ago, I (now 32F, 29 at the time) was in an accident at work. I was a truck driver and was hit pretty much head on by a drunk driver. Because of this accident, I struggled with walking and had to leave my chosen career and I lost my first house a few months after due to financial problems. My mom was living with me when I lost my house, so her and I started planning for when i would finally get my settlement to buy my next home. 

It was great and I loved the idea of being able to provide a place she could retire in. During the 3 years of waiting, I also started dating a close friend of mine who we will call Dale (41M) and plans continued smoothly since mom loved him immediately.  

Fast forward to when I got the settlement and I buy the house. Dale and I move out before mom. His (19F) daughter Hazel moved with us and I got the 3rd bedroom set up and ready for mom. Everything seemed to be going really well and I was super happy. 

Mom finally moves in with us at the beginning of august 2025. Bringing her dog and 4 cats (two of which i didn't know about) I won't go into all the details because i keep being told it's too long, but during the one month she was here with us she did a lot of weird and a-holey things. 

The biggest is, she stopped sleeping in the house for reasons still unclear to me. She would stay out in the rv, which didn't have a bed in it since that was in her actual bedroom, and would only come in the house to shower, complain about something, or leave her dog with me to take care of. She refused multiple times to let us bring the mattress out to the RV so she would have something to sleep on that wasn't the couch or plywood bedframe that's standard in rvs. 

Anyways, onto the blow up. Her dog, who we'll call Wally, had offically been moved into the house with me after she cussed him out, calling him F-ing stupid because he wanted to play ball, and she threated to tie him up outside in the rain, simply because he wanted her attention.  I told her i was taking Wally because I was the one who raised him and she was being abusive to her dog that just wanted to play. She said she didn't care and started telling Wally that he has a new mommy and she doesn't love him anymore... 

2 days later, my mom comes in the house at 4am and tries to open our bedroom door to get Wally. Dale had the door locked because this wasn't the first time that month she had opened our door or came into our room unannounced. Mom, after noticing the door was locked, started shaking the handle violently and started shouting her dogs name. 

Both dogs start barking, waking me up and i asked Dale what was going on. Since he was already awake, he quickly told me what was happening as i could hear my mom start banging on my door, still shouting for wally. 

I go out of my room and ask her wtf is wrong with her. It's 4am, and everyone is sleeping. She said she wanted her dog back and i told her No because what she was doing was inappropriate and she was mean to him. 

We argue before she turns around and walks into my kitchen to start making coffee while still yelling at me to give her the dog back or she would call the police. 
I said Go for it, because I wasn't giving her Wally to tie up outside. 
 
She dials 911 and starts shouting to them that I stole her dog and wouldn't give it back to her. She continues to make her coffee all casually like it's any other day, then out of nowhere she starts literally screaming on the phone to the police that i was hitting her. Going ""SHE'S HITTING ME! OMG SEND HELP NOW SHE'S HITTING ME! I'M A 60 YEAR OLD WOMAN AND SHE IS HITTING ME PLEASE HELP"" 

Dale is standing in the hallway watching all this unfold as I'm outside the kitchen with my mind is blown. I start saying, ""I'm not even touching you,  what are you talking about?"" And as she continues to plead for help I tell her she is done and to get out of my house. I walk over to her, grab her cup and pour it all over my counter (I missed the sink) and tell her to gtfo. 

I grab her coffee pot and follow her as she walks out my front door. I hand her the coffee pot and she screams on the phone to the police that i just shoved her out the door. I slam the door in her face and turn around to see that Hazel is also awake, asking what just happened. I let her know that we're going to finally meet our local police but she could hide in her room if she wanted. 

While Dale and I waited, i started grabbing all of moms things out of her room and literally threw them out the door. Me, in all my crippleness, am chucking her crap out of my house like I just caught my man cheating on me. I for sure broke some things but I didn't care at that point.

The police arrived and came into the house to talk to me and Dale after speaking with my mom. At one point the Sherrif i was talking to told me he was listening to the call on his way up. I saw him reach up to his body cam and flip it off before he tells me ""She's a problem for you,  you need to get her off your property."" Welcome to the party my guy. Lol Sadly I had to give Wally to her because she had vet paperwork with her name on it. Even the cops were upset about this. 

Anyways, they really liked us, really didn't like her, and they told her to leave my property and warned her to leave us alone otherwise they would come back and put her in cuffs. Lol. She packed all her crap and left, flipping me off as she drove away. 


Update: Feb 2026, my mom was arrested! She got caught going from Mexico to the US with 102lbs of a controlled substance that starts with an M.

1r88iw0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r88iw0,A Frontier Journal (Post #5) – “...Our Feet Again Without a Dollar.”,"For those just joining, this is a 22-page handwritten journal/letter from an ancestor who traveled west in the late 19th century in pursuit of mining ventures across Colorado, Utah, and Nevada.

In the earlier installments, he describes financial hardship, organizing speculative mining companies, traveling by emigrant train to Nevada, searching unsuccessfully for a “Bonanza,” and forming relationships with members of the Paiute tribe. The journey then widens to Salt Lake City, the San Juan Mountains, and a brutal high-altitude crossing into the Animas River basin. The last post ended with a tense standoff on a mountain trail with a bear:

>*“…soon his hair raised. So did ours.”*

What follows moves from confrontation to consequence — boom and bust, legal battles, illness, and loss.

Our best plan was to give him the trail. As we thought it was not worth contending for. He walked some 50 or 60 yards up the hillside. He saw the road was clear for him and came on down but watched us sharply as he passed by. This is when I thought of the girl left behind. Trip was determined to follow old Bruno but I held him tight in my arms. In Silvertown I met with one of the descendants of the famous (Something) Girl mine had sold his interested in Nov\[ember\] for $38,000. 8 month had elapsed his money all gone and was cursing the country because it was hard times.

...and others. The mine I speak of is located near St Elmo of this state that section of the country is (melted) for snow slides and many miners have lossed their lives by theses avalanches. Worked there all winter we spent about $5000. Was about to make a sale for $80,000 when the sheriff came and took possession of the property claiming that another party owned the ground. After a long contest we had to surrender. It has since proved to be a very valuable mine. This left us on our feet again without a dollar. At this time I was taking sick and went to Hay Woods hot springs. Stayed there two months and returned to (Manitou?). Trip was taking Trip at the same time. I tried as best I could but poor little dog died. Some of the guests at the hotel helped me to make a box in which he was laid to rest. We buried him near the creek with a board placed at the head of his grave giving his name and date of his departure from earth.

Format

One season = one full overnight shift

Each episode = one real hour

10 episodes

9:00 PM to 7:00 AM

Real time storytelling. No time jumps. No music montages. Just the rhythm of the grill, the bell on the door, and whatever walks in.

Setting

A Waffle House off a highway exit outside a mid sized Southern city.

It is the kind of place where:

Truckers reset

College kids sober up

Night shift nurses decompress

Cops refuel

People with nowhere else to go linger

The restaurant never closes. And neither does the tension.

Has worked there 18 years. Knows every regular. Calm under pressure. Fiercely protective of her crew.

Trying to keep the store afloat while corporate audits loom.

The Grill Master – Reggie (50s)

Fast. Precise. Never rattled. Talks very little but sees everything.

Divorced. Estranged daughter. This shift will force him to confront something.

The Server – Kayla (22)

Single mom. Community college student. Smart. Quick witted.

Working doubles to cover rent after her ex stopped paying child support.

The New Hire – Mateo (19)

First job. Recently moved. Quiet. Observant.

Tonight is his first overnight shift.

Former high school football coach. Lives alone.

Claims he just likes the coffee. Stays all night.

1r88hvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/InstagramMarketing/comments/1r88hvz/promote_existing_instagram_posts_vs_using_them_as/,Promote existing Instagram posts vs using them as creatives in ads? (Goal: followers + awareness for a hip café),"Hey everyone,

I’m running Meta ads for a client and would love some advice from people who’ve tested this a lot.

Context:
My client owns an aesthetically high-end, “hipster” café in Austria — very Copenhagen / Scandinavian coffee shop vibe. They already have a strong IG presence with 20k+ followers, good content quality, and some posts historically generated a lot of followers and engagement organically.

Goal:
Mainly to gain more relevant followers (ideally people who might actually visit), and secondarily local brand awareness.

My initial plan:
Boost / promote the posts that already performed best organically (high follower growth + engagement), because they seem “proven.”

Questions:
	1.	Is it generally smarter to “boost/promote” those exact posts (so the ad shows the same post with the existing likes/comments/social proof),
or should I build ads in Ads Manager and use those posts as creatives (same visuals, but not necessarily the same post ID)?
	2.	For follower growth + awareness: do you usually optimize for Engagement, Video Views, Reach, or Traffic to IG profile (if using placements that allow it)?
I’m aware “followers” isn’t a direct conversion event in Meta, so curious what people have found actually correlates best with real follower increases.
	3.	Audiences:
	•	How useful are Custom Audiences like Instagram account engagers, video viewers, and profile visitors for this kind of local business?
	•	Any best practice on retargeting windows (7 days vs 30 vs 90) for cafés/restaurants?
	4.	Lookalikes:
Do you find Lookalikes of IG engagers/profile visitors helpful for local businesses, or do they get too broad / less “visit-intent”?
If you use lookalikes, what’s your typical setup (1%, 2–3%, stacked, etc.) — and do you restrict them with geo radius around the café?
	5.	Any “don’t do this” pitfalls when the brand already has 20k followers?
(e.g., promoting viral posts that attract tourists/out-of-country followers, etc.)

If anyone has a tested framework for cafés / restaurants (especially in Europe), I’d really appreciate it. Happy to share results once we run it.

Thanks!

I can drink the same exact cup of coffee and it will taste different depending on how I sip it. If I take a large sip and let it rest on the back of my tongue for a second, it will taste massively different from sipping a small amount and swallowing it as quickly as possible. 

So, is there a right way (or the best way) to literally drink coffee? I feel like no one talks about this, but for me it makes way more of a difference than water quality or number of pours. ",2,1771433813.0,pourover,7,0.6,False

I (24F) recently got officially diagnosed in January with RA, I have been on Plaquenil for less than a month and with a doctor’s note I have been able to have 6h shifts at the coffee shop i work at and it has helped a lot even though I still have night/morning hand stiffness and knee/hip pain.

My job is closing its doors and I am in a really tough position as I am expecting to start my student teaching in September! I am going to graduate school for Spanish Education and hopefully I will be able to sit regularly and not do any heavy lifting once i become a teacher.

My part time job was really nice because they let me sit every time there weren’t any customers and it wasn’t a high-paced place. 

I am looking for a short-term part time job until September but every time I read the qualifications they ask to stand for long periods of time (8h), lift up to 20/50 lbs, and that is something that scares me because it might trigger a flare since Plaquenil hasn’t fully kicked in yet. (And i got my first flare by mopping and closing the coffee shop every night) 

Do you think I should tell the employers I have this condition and if I can get away with not lifting really heavy items? Do you usually tell employers that you have RA? 

I applied for Skechers retail part time and then a Visitor associate in a botanical garden and i didn’t tell them about this because I am afraid that if I do I won’t be hired :(

We've been dating for 3 years and I'm 26 and he's 28 and he's a good person. But my parents, they don't approve of him because he's that old and they don't want to me date him. Since they said that, I haven't been answering any of his text or phone calls for a week. I decided to schedule a talk with him at a coffee cafe. I called for him to meet me and the cafe to talk. This was the conversation we had and how it went down:

Boyfriend: Why haven't you been answering any of my text, is something wrong?

Me: yes, there is a problem...

Boyfriend: what is it?

Me: ...I don't think we should see each other anymore...

Boyfriend: what, why?

Me: I respect your tolerance, but... I learned something. True tolerance has decency at its boundary. We have to accept some standards of right and wrong. And without that nothing makes sense, nothing works.

Boyfriend: but what does that have to do with us?

Me: look, you've already told me you planned on outgrowing our relationship...

Boyfriend: But, what do you expect from me?

Me: nothing. But, I try my best to live by my parents standard of decency. And to accept anything outside of that boundary is a dead end!

Boyfriend: but why does this have to be so black and white?

Me: it's not about things being black and white. It's about right and wrong, and loyalty. I just want to do what's right!

Boyfriend: what about making the world a better place?

Me: it's time to think beyond high school debates and newspapers.

Boyfriend: don't do this to me, Your by best friend! Why not, trust your heart?

Me: I believe with my whole heart, that this is the right thing to do! If I start a relationship, it has to be with someone my parents will approve of. I can't accept anything less. I'm, not comfortable with your standards anymore!

After this conversation, I grabbed my coffee and got up and left the cafe. I also removed him from my messages and phone calls. ",0,1771433573.0,confession,34,0.14,False

This all happened in 3-4 months, and the age gap is a couple of years. Shes been single for 6+ months.

 

From the start were both at college, in the same class. It begun after we were paried together in labs, she would get too close, like scoot next to me on the wall or stand/lean too close to me. Then when we would talk she would glance at my mouth and I didnt really think it was anything special just that she cant hold eye contact or that Im holding it too much, especially I didnt find it too weird since were both girls and she had a boyfriend last year. As well she was putting on lip balm and just staring at me, I mean I was staring back cuz I was in awe, but why stare back lol. Then before winter break after we were walking home she asked me would I was to go get a beer to celebrate last labs before christmas, it was like 5pm. I was too hungover and told her another time and that was it for now, then she messaged me randomly to say merry xmas (we werent messaging then), I was still weirded out by it, since I didnt even think that maybe she likes me. As well to add, we talked about something related to lesbians during labs (she initiated that). I told all of this to my friends and they told me she might like me and then it clicked. Like shes so much my type in every way that I thought why would I even shoot my shot, especially since I really thought we were just friends.



Then I asked her after those labs actually ended to go get drinks and after labs we did just that, and she told me she had to go to a quiz after so she cant stay too long. As well she told me she was me on a dating app and I know it said there I dont like dudes, she couldve only seen me before the semester started so before she even started getting close to me. And then she told me about her experiences with her ex, how he didnt liked that shes bi, how he didnt like when she wears heels, and that she doesnt believe that drinks/coffee between female and male friends ends well because someone will catch feelings. So she came out to me and told me she doesnt mind short people (Im short :I) and asked me about my sexuality. As well, she wanted to show me how a dude she went out with interacted with her physically, she grabbed my shoulder and my leg to show which is weird since neither of us are touchy people and then wanted to show me a bruise on her knee (at that point it was invisible) and pulled her pant leg like way above the knee, but why even show a bruise. This all in my mind seemed very not just friends. She stayed half an hour longer then had to rush to get ready and told me she really liked my company and that we should go again.



Then I asked her out again but it was during exam season and she couldnt make it, which is fine by me, life is life. Then she suggested next week and when it came she asked me out and we went. 8pm in a bar not next to campus... we then talked there about her interests, family and such, kind of bonded over our bad fathers and such, then she started talking about some of her really personal stuff and I listened. So this went okay, like she was into the conversation and I was too, then at the end she told me could she wait with me while my taxi comes and I told her could I walk you home, since I can call a cab there, then she told me she wanted to go to a dudes house. She turned around abruptly and just kind of blurted it out, like a kid telling their parent they did something to see their reaction. Ill call this dude just dude, for context she told me about him the first time, how hes kind of a smart ass and how she picked him up at a club. Kind of like when girls have someone to talk to just to kill the boredom, at least thats the impression I got since my friends do similar stuff. 



She randomly messages me after her exams to say how it went and I randomly message her as well. Kind of made jokes about how Im spending Valentines day taking an exam.



I kind of felt rejected after last time, but after the random messages and after finding out she told her friends that she went out with me and how she enjoyed my company, I mean shes not out to them so she wouldnt have said anything deeper right and its kind of odd to mention to your friends going out with someone random. I was wondering if all of the closeness is just something a friend might do, to add, she doesnt stand too close to people so her getting close to me was weird.

The ""mass apply"" strategy is basically a lottery at this point. While you should keep the application volume up, I don't think you can ***only*** do that and expect to find success.

For context, I host a career discovery podcast that interviews people in all professions (healthcare, tech, finance, sales, public policy) to help people find the right path for them. And one thing is consistent: those that went the extra mile doing things that feel ""extra"" were the ones that found consistent success.

What does ""extra"" mean? Some examples:

* One student spent six months just building rapport with a SINGLE recruiter at a big tech firm. He showed up to every recruiting campus event and literally helped the recruiter carry donuts and pizza boxes into the lobby each time. He made himself impossible to ignore by being useful. The recruiter didn't even hire for his role, but eventually got him in touch with the right people.
* Another person found a hiring manager’s phone number online and cold called him for a sales job. He just asked for 60 seconds to pitch himself. (I acknowledge this won't work every profession and could come off creepy, but this is a sales job. They live on cold calls, and he subtly proved he had the skills to do it well).
* I talked to an Optometrist who googled practices in their area and calling dozens of them just to ask for a few hours of ""shadowing"" time to get their foot in the door. This got him his first gig.
* For me personally, when reaching out to companies that I REALLY want to work for, I'll put together an unsolicited 5-minute slide deck on what I would want to work on if got the job. Then I search for who I think the hiring manager *could* be on LinkedIn, narrow it to 5 people, and then send it to each of them. So far this has a 90% success rate in getting a response.

You get the point. I used to think this stuff was ""too much"" or even a bit cringey, but when the front door is locked and guarded by an algorithm, the side door is the only way in. It’s a lot harder to have 5 coffee chats than it is to click a button 50 times, but one of those actually leads to a human connection.

I totally understand how tough the market is, especially for early career folk. It's tough competition with few spots. But when all your competition is doing the same thing (mass applying), that's an opportunity for you to do something different.",5,1771433439.0,jobs,6,0.63,False

Do you want to grab coffee or tea?

It's a good day to catch up.

Unless it's not a good day to catch up.

Then maybe suggest another day? I can clear my calendar, tell anyone who needs help no(they tell me no, it's probable ok). 

I wanted to reach out, but I'm not sure if it's ever a good time. I didn't know if you were upset with me, so I didn't wish you a happy birthday. I'm sorry I assumed that and didn't ask. I heard you have some stuff going on and I wanted to let you know I'd like to hear about it. All of it! Good, bad, and in-between. 

I'd like to apologize for some things and ask a few questions. Been looking for your number for a few weeks(ok, maybe longer). I'm bad about saving numbers to my phone. Had to replace a few and switch business lines. 

I'm really sorry I haven't been present lately. There was a lot more on my plate than I could manage. But I'm working hard to set boundaries and be more available. 

I understand if you don't want to go. I was really upset the last time we spoke. People are doing things to me that I wouldn't do to them. Makes it hard to trust anyone. But I'm really trying to be more trusting... and less trusting of the wrong people. Sometimes I have limitations that aren't self limiting beliefs, but sometimes they're just limits I have to learn to manage and ask for help with. 

I have been reaching out for help. I'm always worried about bothering them. Most of the time they have their own stuff going on and need to say no. 

Really, any day. Rain or shine. 

only yours,


Jackass

1r888z6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1r888z6/the_thing_behind_me_wants_me_to_turn_around_part/,"The Thing behind me wants me to turn around, Part 4 Finale","The culture shock of New York City was otherworldly to me. The lights and noise flooded my senses with a mass of stimuli. I was astounded and, quite frankly, overwhelmed by the sheer volume of people. Like ants, they hurried here and there, too busy to realize that they were alive. The modern world frightened me. For much of my life, I sought to avoid it, which was largely successful. My only true experience with the hustle and bustle of modernity was my college days, and they were quite tame in comparison to the city in which I found myself. Looking around, I sighed, knowing my time of isolation in nature was now permanently behind me, I resolved to make the most of this new lease on life, no matter how second-rate I felt it to be. Leaving the bus station behind, I joined the herd of people moving down the streets. Mindlessly, I wandered for a time, being carried on the current of the crowd. Until reality hit. I would be out on the streets if I didn’t find a place to spend the night. The streets after dark would offer little protection from the HideBehind, yet somehow, I knew that was the worst of my worries in this city. So, after a quick Google search for the cheapest hotel in the area, I broke off from the school of people I had swam with and charted my own course in search of a cheap room.

The Sunrise Inn was a dump. Nothing more than four walls and a roof. Its primary guests were bed bugs and roaches. Yet it was cheap and had a locking door.  As I walked into the shabby lobby, the young man sitting behind the front desk locked eyes with me. He was no more than 23 years old, with greasy black hair and a button-down shirt 2 sizes too big. In his hands, he held a tattered copy of The Shining, and on his left shirt pocket hung a crooked nametag that read: 'Chris.'

“You lost or something?”

he lazily said as I strolled over to the counter. I shook my head and said,

“No, I’m here for a room.”

 He smirked and quickly rolled his eyes,

 “Of course you are.”

He stood up and sluggishly moved three feet to stand in front of the desktop, where he stumbled through the check-in process as if he had forgotten how to do it.

 “How long will you be staying?”

 Chris asked,

“Three nights” I replied.

His eyes widened at that

“I’ve never booked someone for that long, most people are just here for the night” he remarked.

“yeah well, I just need a room for a few days,”

 He snorted and said, “None of my business man.”

finishing up the check-in he said, “We don’t allow pets,”

as he finally handed me the room key.

“Thanks,”

I said as I accepted the key.

“What’s the Wi-Fi password?”

 he looked at me as he took a hit on his vape. “We don’t have guest Wi-Fi.”

 He must have noticed my scowl because he followed up by saying,

“Look, man, you get what you pay for, I don’t make the rules.”

Annoyed, I replied, “Whatever, thanks, I guess.”

 I walked down the hall on the first floor towards the elevator. As I did, I heard Chris shout out behind me,

“Hey man, be sure to leave us a good rating!”

Opening the door to room 203, I was greeted with the strong musty smell of mold mixed with cigarette smoke. The room was small; it held one queen-size bed, which smelled of sweat and mothballs. The bed faced a small TV mounted on the wall, a thrift store armchair faced the bed, and a small bathroom with a shower and sink sat in the corner near the door. I threw my bag upon the bed, threw the deadbolt on the door, and headed to the shower.

The crummy room on the second floor of the Sunrise Inn was not a permanent stop. It would serve as a place to sleep and return to as I searched for an apartment to rent. This directive was the first thought in my mind as I awoke the following day; I must find a home. Leaving my room, I took the elevator to the ground floor, and walking past the desk, I saw that a large middle-aged woman had replaced Chris. A nametag on her shirt read 'Marge.' And she glanced at me as I headed to the door,

 “Morning,” she muttered in a raspy smoker's voice as I walked out onto the street.

 I spent the majority of the morning in a Starbucks just a few blocks down from the hotel. I ordered a small black coffee, and chuckled to myself when I saw that the barista somehow managed to misspell my name she had written on the cup. Sitting in a small private booth near one of the large pane glass windows that overlooked the busy street, I opened my phone, connected to the café’s free Wi-Fi, and started my search for a more permanent home. Over the next several hours, countless listings appeared on the small screen of my iPhone. An overwhelming stream of bedrooms and bathrooms that all remained locked behind monthly costs that boggled my mind. I quickly gave up the dream of modest square footage, and hesitantly limited my search to broom closets and rooms of similar size. Growing impatient and rather frustrated, I knew I had to find a place soon. I wanted to leave the Sunrise Inn behind as soon as possible.

 As my search reached the three-hour mark, a small single-occupant apartment caught my eye. At 750 square feet, it contained a single room with a small bathroom attached, a small kitchenette in one corner of the room, a small living room with a pull-out couch that doubled as the bed, and one tiny coat closet. Other than the couch, a worn desk, and a matching chair, the room was empty. It wasn’t great, but it was affordable and better than the motel, and with no other options, I dialed the number of the building manager. As it rang, I stepped out of the coffee shop onto the street outside. On the third ring, a gruff voice said,

“This is Patrick.”  

“Um, hi Patrick,” I replied, “I’m calling about an available apartment in the building you manage, room 362?”

 A long silence followed, and for a moment I thought the call had dropped, but then came the voice in response,

“Why did you bring it here?”

confused I said, “Bring what? I’ve never been there.”

 A coarse broken laughter oozed out of the phone, and then, as quick as it started, it stopped. It was replaced by heavy, damp breathing. As the breathing continued, there came a low, quiet voice, far deeper and more malicious than the voice of Patrick.

“You can’t hide; it will take you, and after it’s done with you, it will consume this city.”

 In that moment, I realized that the breathing wasn’t coming from the phone. The phone was at my right ear, but the breathing filled my left ear. It was coming from behind me, from the alley that opened up behind my back. My body tensed at the realization, and as it did, a heavy, bony hand grasped my shoulder. The breathing moved closer to my head, and soon it was right next to my left ear. Directly into my ear came a low whisper,

“Look at me.”

Panic flooded my mind and adrenaline surged through my veins. I pulled away from the hand on my shoulder and ran down the sidewalk like a madman. Stepping into the road, the loud honk of the taxi I ran out in front of broke me from my mindless terror. I stopped there in the middle of the street, looking around. My mind calmed as I realized I wasn’t being chased; in fact, there was no sign of the monster that just seconds ago caused my outburst. The taxi continued its honking, and the driver yelled and shook his fist at me. embarrassed as I remembered that I was standing in the middle of the road, I quickly returned to the sidewalk, and realized that my phone was still talking to me.

“Hello?” it screamed, “what the heck is going on?”

 I quickly raised it to my ear and said,

 “Hello? Patrick? I’m sorry.”

“Kid, what’s going on? You go quiet on me, and then all I hear is screaming and horns. Is this a joke? Are you wasting my time?”

“No, no, I’m sorry, I don’t know what happened.”

 I paused, trying to think of an excuse,

“I wasn’t paying attention and walked into the street, and a taxi driver got upset.”

 “Huh, welcome to New York, kid, so what’s the deal? Are you going to take the room or not? I’m a busy guy.”

 “Is there any way I could come take a look at it before making a decision?” I sheepishly said.

He sighed

“yeah I guess I have some time tomorrow morning, just don’t be wasting my time.”

 “I swear I’m not, I’ll be there tomorrow morning.”

 Hanging up the phone and quickly looking around, I joined a crowd of people heading in the direction of the Sunrise Inn. After stopping to grab some fast food, I walked into the familiar lobby and quickly climbed the stairs to the second floor, where I found some safety behind the locked door of my room. I didn’t dare leave the room; the afternoon's events really shook me. I knew the HideBehind would return eventually, but I hadn’t expected it so soon. Its presence in the city really backed me into a corner. No matter how run-down or overpriced Patrick’s apartment was, I knew it was my only option, and I no longer had the time to find another. Turning on the TV, I flung my body onto the bed and opened the greasy fast-food bag. I gave my evening to the Discovery Channel's 'Gold Rush' and an overpriced cheeseburger. Somewhere around 9 PM, I slowly surrender myself to sleep. I awoke several hours later to a dark room brought to life by the low blue flicker of the TV, which was now playing a rerun of 'Naked and Afraid.' My eyes glanced at the clock on the nightstand, which read 3:03 AM. Confused about why I had woken up, I suddenly became aware of a low, almost inaudible sound. It wasn’t coming from the TV but from the short hallway leading to the door—a low tapping. Tap tap tap. It was quiet, but thymic and intentional. Tap tap tap. I swallowed hard as I slowly rose from the bed and stood in place, waiting to hear it again just to be sure. Tap tap tap. There it was again. I slowly crept to the door and stood directly in front of it. The light entering the room from under the door was broken by a large shadow. Tap tap tap. It was louder now as I stood mere feet from the door, and it continued as I inched closer. Soon, I was just a few inches from the wooden door, reaching out my hand, I quietly placed it on its textured surface.

The tapping sent vibrations through the wood and into my hand, which I instinctively pulled back. The vibrations unnerved me far more than the sound alone. I backed up as fast as I could, but in my haste, my right heel connected with one of the shoes that I had placed in the hallway when I had removed them earlier that evening. My heel sent my shoe across the floor, and it slammed against the wall with a loud thump. I froze, and so did the shadow behind the door. The tapping stopped as I held my breath. For a moment, nothing happened, and then the silence was shattered by loud, powerful thumps. They came fast and vicious. The thumps assaulted the hotel door, which shook under the barrage of angry thuds. What was once a quiet tapping was now thuds that filled the small room with loud, angry noise. It was unbearable, and my hands raced to cover my ears as I sank to the floor. On and on it went, louder and louder the thuds became. In agony, I lay, crumpled on the floor, hands gripping my ears. But then it stopped. The room fell silent. Slowly, I lowered my hands from my ears. I pulled myself off the floor and into a sitting position on the cold, hard floor. I sat there trying to slow my breathing and worked my way to my feet. But then came a new sound. A wet gasping sound filled the room; it froze my blood when I realized that this sound came from within the room, not from the door.

Slowly, I turned my head to the main section of the room, and there, sitting on the edge of the bed, illuminated by the flickering TV, was the shape of a man. His back faced me; I couldn’t see his face, but I could tell that he wore a dirty, bloody park ranger's uniform. Where his neck met his skull, there was a gaping, visible hole that moved and shifted as wet, gasping breaths escaped from it. His bones creaked and clicked as he stood from bed. He turned to face me, and I was met with the deformed face of Reg. Bloody puddles replaced his eyes, and where his mouth should have been was the fleshy hole through his lower skull and spine; his lower jaw hung loosely below by strings of skin. He stood staring at me, and from the hole in his face came the inhuman, broken words,

""Naa-ttee yoouU Ki-L edd mme""

 I screamed as the corpse lurched forward towards me, and scrambled back towards the door. Reg leaped at me, and I found myself falling towards the floor as I slipped on the shoe I had sent across the floor earlier. My face met the floor hard, causing a large cut to form on my forehead and a sharp sense of pain throughout my skull. I yelled in surprise as I felt the warm blood run down my head. I rolled myself over, expecting to see the horrible face of Reg inches from me, but all I saw was the warm glow of the TV in an empty hotel room.

For the rest of the night, sleep eluded me, and fear consumed me. My senses were on high alert; every creak and distant noise put me on guard. At this point, I couldn’t tell if what I had just experienced was reality, a nightmare, or some form of hallucination. In fact, thinking back to the encounter I had on the street that morning, I began to question if that was real, either. The only encounters I could be sure of were the ones that resulted in death or injury. Everything else must either be a dream or in my mind. This thought sent a warm wave of courage through me; it meant the hand on my shoulder this morning wasn’t real, that the banging on the door and the reanimated corpse of Reg was just in my mind. None of it was real, I told myself, and when I get settled in this city, perhaps I would see a doctor and get help for my unsettled mind. The HideBehind is real, I knew that, but the last encounter with it that I knew was real happened on the border of Idaho, thousands of miles away.

 Then came a thought that would alter my perspective going forward: What if the HideBehind never left the Northwest region? What if it were limited to its ancient home in the Cascade mountains? Maybe the dreams and hallucinations were just residual effects from interacting with an eldritch being like a HideBehind. Everything since Idaho had happened when I was alone or asleep, and none of it had any impact on the surrounding world. How was the train not damaged or slowed down at all when it hit a giant monster? How did an entire street of people not notice the creature grabbing my shoulder? It was all in my head; it must be, the HideBehind never left the mountainous dominion, and I was just seeing things. This thought sent a spark of life into my body. For the first time in a while, I felt like I could truly breathe and relax. Around 5:30, I stood up, took a shower, and got ready for the day. The first day of my new life.  

At around 7:30, I prepared to head out for the day. I opened the door, praying that I was right and wasn’t opening it to the beast. Thankfully, the hall was as empty as could be, which only reinforced my theory within my mind. The free breakfast was abysmal. Expired dry cereal and rock-hard biscuits with fatty gravy. After eating, I shuffled over to the front desk, where Chris lazily greeted me.

“Hey man,” he said, loudly chewing some bubble gum. “Can I help you?”

 “Yeah, I’d like to check out.”

He nodded quickly, “Can do, how was your stay?”

“It was adequate,” I blankly said.

His eyes widened as he said, “Really? That’s probably the best response I’ve gotten here.”

 I stared at him, looking for any signs of sarcasm, which I didn’t find. Having closed my account at the Sunrise Inn, I then headed out into the morning busyness of New York. The Bryson Building was across the city in the heart of Brooklyn, requiring me to take the subway. The New York subway was a shock to my senses. They smelled heavily of body odor and urine, and I had seen cleaner dumpsters. The small subway cars were packed tighter than a can of sardines, and I wormed my way in and found a spot to stand in the back. According to the map of stops, I could expect to be on board for about an hour. I have never felt more claustrophobic in life than I did that first ride on the subway; it took every ounce of my being to resist the urge to scream and push my way out of the sea of people. I began to sweat, and it felt like I was to be forever trapped here, boiled alive by the heat of a hundred human bodies. With every twist and turn of the subway, a stranger would bump into me, destroying every illusion of peace my mind tried to conjure up. I dreaded the idea of having to travel this way every day, but as time went on, the passengers gradually dispersed. By the time the subway reached my stop, only a few dozen riders remained. Stepping out into the open, I breathed in the hot, muggy air of Brooklyn, far better than the recycled air that filled my lungs for the last hour. With all of my earthly possessions securely in my backpack, I began the five-block journey from the subway stop to the Bryson Building.

From the outside, the Bryson Building was nothing special. It was a 10-floor apartment building built in the cold, unattractive style of the late 80s; nothing had been updated in over a decade. And that’s not to say it was uncared for or run down; it was simply old. Walking into the main entrance was like walking into the past. Directly inside was an elevator lobby similar to that of an office building. The lobby was decorated with too many fake trees and plants, and a smooth granite floor that continued up the walls as well. Next to the twin elevators was a large bulletin board covered with names and corresponding room numbers. I looked around the bare room, and to the right, I saw a short hallway that led to a lone door, which bore a little plaque that read ‘management.’ Walking over to the door, I knocked on it gently. A tall, thin man opened the door; he looked to be in his early 60s, with a full head of gray hair and a face wrinkled from years of frowning.

“Yeah? You need something?” he said in a low, gruff voice.

 “um yeah, I’m looking for Patrick,” I meekly answered.

 “You’re looking at him.” Came his response,

“Oh, hi, I’m here to look at room 362? We spoke about it on the phone yesterday?”

“Oh yeah, you’re the kid who couldn’t stop screaming, right?” he said with a smirk. I could feel my cheeks getting hot

“Oh yeah, that was me, sorry about that.” I said with a weak chuckle.

“eh whatever, let’s go and look at the room quick.”

 And with that, he led me to the elevators, and after the most awkward elevator ride I’ve ever had, we reached the third floor. Room 362 was nearly identical to the pictures from the online ad, except for a fresh coat of paint that made the space seem bigger. As the ad promised, the room included the pull-out couch, the small desk and chair, as well as a hot plate in the kitchen and a small fridge and freezer. I liked it. As small as it was, it was well cared for and had a homey feel to it. Turning to Patrick, I asked,

“Does it come with Wi Fi?”

 he smiled and said, “For an extra 20 a month, it does.”

Nodding, I replied, “How much up front?”

“The first two months, and we’ll go from there,” he said,

reaching his hand out to shake mine. I offer my hand in return as we headed downstairs to start the paperwork.

By noon, the room was mine. Keys in hand, I walked into my new home and unpacked my pack, putting my few clothes and items into their designated spots. The empty backpack found its home in the small closet. The down payment had taken half of my remaining government money. With the rest, I planned to purchase home essentials and enough food to last until I secured a steady job. It was Friday, and I planned to get what I needed that afternoon, rest for the weekend, and start looking for a job on Monday. Being sure to lock the door, I left for the nearest grocery store. From pots and pans to a shower curtain, I bought what I thought I needed, and along with two months' worth of ramen noodles and a box of Twinkies, I headed back to the Bryson Building. Along the way, I stopped at a local electronics store and purchased a cheap laptop, which would double as my TV.

That night I had another nightmare. I dreamt that a tapping at the window woke me up, the sound of fingernails against glass. I stood up and walked to the window. Out the window on the street below stood four figures underneath a streetlight. I could see it was three men and a woman; they stood perfectly still for a few moments, then suddenly they all raised one of their arms and all pointed right at me. At that moment, I felt as though I wasn’t alone in my room, and I turned and came face to face with the HideBehind, who grabbed my head and threw me out the window. As my body hit the pavement, I awoke shaking and sweating. Eventually, my mind calmed down enough to fall back asleep.  

That first weekend at Bryson was rainy and lazy. I barely left the apartment, and when I did, it was only to explore the building a bit. Mostly, I sat on the couch reading Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and searching for a job on my laptop. One job listing in particular caught my eye— a local deli and sandwich shop that seemed to be a mainstay in the community. For a part-time position, Hartman’s Deli was offering a decent wage, better than Arby’s had paid me. The deli was reasonably close; only one subway stop away. Saturday morning, I filled out an online application, and by Monday evening, the deli reached out to set up an in-person interview for Wednesday morning.

Wednesday came, and I found myself walking back towards the subway, preparing my mind for the moments of terror that would follow. Thankfully, the trip was only 10 minutes. Exiting the subway, I hurried along to the deli, which was located on a busy street corner. Hartman’s was a classic New York Deli and sandwich shop; the interior, though small, was cozy and inviting. The centerpiece of the store was the large deli counter, which stored a large array of meats, cheeses, and breads behind its glass walls. I walked to the counter and informed the employee that I was there for a job interview. The employee retreated to the back room and returned with an elderly woman who had kind eyes. She shook my hand and introduced herself as Ms. Maggie, the deli’s owner.

“Nice to meet you, Nate. Why don’t we go sit down?”

 We found a secluded booth and began the interview. She asked me about my past work experience, and I chose to leave out my brief time as a Park Ranger, as it wouldn’t be relevant to this position. After she gathered my restaurant experience, Ms. Maggie asked me how many hours I was willing to work. When I said,

 “as many as you got,”

 she smiled and said, “Excellent.”

 After a few more minutes of small talk,  she said,

 “Nate, you seem like a great candidate, and I’d like to offer you the position if you still want it.”

 I smiled and said, “Great! When can I start?”

 Maggie’s face beamed as she said, “How does Friday sound?”

 As I returned to my apartment, my heart filled with a sense of accomplishment and a feeling of belonging. Maybe life in the city isn’t that bad.

My first shift was scheduled to start at 2 pm on Friday and run until the shop closed at 9 pm. I made sure to arrive early, and when I approached the counter, I warmly introduced myself to the man behind it. He smiled broadly and introduced himself as Billy, the evening shift manager.

“Why don’t you come on into the back and grab yourself an apron?”

 he said in a melodic voice. He was a heavy-set man, probably around 30 years old, with dark skin and a well-kept beard; he seemed like someone who enjoyed his job and loved to laugh. I entered the back room, and Billy showed me where the aprons were and how to clock in. Afterwards, he led me to the kitchen prep area, where the shop cured deli meats, baked breads, and prepared hot subs when ordered.

“You’re part of our prep team, so you’ll be back here most of the time,”

 Billy said as he led us into the space.

“Ms. Maggie has assigned you to us on the evening shift, so we’ll be working together most days. Usually, we like to have three people working back here in prep.”

He walked me around the room, pointing out each station and introducing me to the two workers already there. Kyle was a tall, middle-aged man with tired eyes. Billy mentioned he and his wife just had a baby. Kyle shook my hand firmly and said,

 “Good to meet you, Nate, welcome to the family.”

Billy called over the other employee, a woman my age named Amy.

“Nate, this is Amy, one of our hardest workers,”

he said with a smile.

Amy blushed and reached out her hand to shake mine.

“Hi, Nate, nice to meet you. I look forward to getting to know you.”

 Her face lit up with a genuine smile. Amy was college-aged, around 5’8” with bright red hair and gentle blue eyes. She seemed happy and content with life.

“Nice to meet you, Amy,” I said, smiling back.

“Well, Nate,” Billy’s words brought me back to the moment,

 “I’m going to leave you here and return to the front, but Amy will train you today and for your first week.”

 I nodded as he left and turned to Amy. I looked at her and jokingly said,

“Alright, boss, what now?”

 She smiled and giggled a bit.

 “Well, Nate, first you need to wash your hands.”

 That shift was great. Amy and I worked together the whole night, and our conversation shifted from work to personal life. Amy talked about her family and school. She grew up in upstate New York and moved to the city to attend fashion school. She had big dreams but was content with where life had taken her for now. I shared my college experience and time in South Dakota. I told her I moved to New York seeking a change of pace. Amy was easy to talk to; she was kind and genuinely interested in me as a person. It was nice to make a real connection with someone. Over the past few weeks, many people had come and gone in my life, and it was refreshing to find a friend I’d see every day in the near future. Near the end of the shift, Amy looked at me and said,

“Hey, some of the other employees and I are going to a bar after work to shoot some pool. If you want, you should come.”

 “Yeah, that would be fun!” I replied, “Which bar?”

Life began to settle, and I grew comfortable with my routine. After six months of working at Hartman’s, the incident in the backwoods of Washington seemed like a distant nightmare that was quickly fading in my mind. My nightmares of the HideBehind had been replaced by pleasant dreams of Amy. A month into working at the deli, I had worked up the courage to ask her out on a date, full of smiles and excitement, she said yes. Our first date was perfect, a picnic lunch in Central Park. Some habits from my trauma in the woods remained; I religiously locked my door, both when I was in and when I was going out, and I was cautious around blind corners. Amy noticed these rituals in my life and would joke about them and ask why I do them. I would always shrug and say it's just a force of habit. Life was good; I had a place to call home, I had a steady job, a small friend group, and a loving girlfriend. I couldn’t think of living anywhere other than New York City.

February arrived in the Big Apple, and with it came Valentine's Day, the first one Amy and I would celebrate together. I had big plans for the evening. I booked a table at one of the fancy restaurants in the upscale part of town months in advance, and I had bought roses and chocolate. I picked Amy up around 6. She was stunning. She smiled at me as I gave her the flowers and chocolate. The kiss she planted on my cheek was the best thank you I had ever received. Amy returned to her apartment to drop off the gifts, and then we walked hand in hand to the subway. Dinner was amazing, the night was filled with laughter and good conversation, and near the end of the night, Amy looked at me and said,

“Nate, I know you worked as a park ranger for a while, but every time it comes up, you're quick to change the subject. Why did you leave the parks service?”

 I paused to think how I should respond. Finally, I said,

“I saw a friend of mine die in a terrible hiking accident. It really messed me up for a while. I started seeing things that weren’t there, and I was plagued with vivid nightmares, so I left, hoping it would get better.”

 Sympathy filled her eyes. “I’m so sorry, are the nightmares you’ve been having from all that?”

I nodded,

“but since I’ve been with you, I don’t get them as often.”

She smiled and reached for my hand.

“I’ll always be there for you, Nate. I love you.”

“I love you too, Amy,” I replied.

 The night ended far too soon. Before long, I was walking Amy back to her apartment. We reached her door and kissed goodnight. Walking back to my apartment, I was filled with a warmth I had never felt before. I truly loved Amy. I wanted to spend my life with her. In that moment, I realized I wanted to marry Amy. As I walked the streets, I passed a local jewelry store. I went in planning to just look around, but ended up leaving with a beautiful engagement ring. I was sure Amy would love it. I returned home, locked the door, stared at the ring for a while, and opened the fridge for a late-night snack, but realized I had put off grocery shopping for far too long, for the fridge was quite bare. A few slices of four-day-old pizza were all I found, and I ate them while watching some TV, then I headed off to bed. At 3 am I woke up to the sound of my phone ringing. It was Amy, and she was distraught.

“Hello?”

 I said, barely awake, Amy was crying as she said,

“Nate? Someone tried to break into my apartment.”

 I was wide awake now.

“What? Are you ok?”

“I don’t know, they broke a window, and I screamed, they ran off, but I’m so scared. The cops are coming, but I don’t know if I can stay here. Can you come get me?”

 “I’ll be right there. Go to your bedroom and lock the door. Don’t open it until me or the cops get there.”

 “ok I will, thank you, Nate.”

Hanging up the phone, I jumped out of bed and got dressed, barely holding back panic. I left so fast I didn’t even lock the door behind me.

Amy was really shaken up. Her sanctuary had been violated; it no longer felt safe. I waited with her until the police arrived, and together we watched them as they examined the apartment and the broken window. One of them told us that they would be on the lookout in case the intruder returned; apparently, home invaders were on the rise this winter. They recommended that Amy spend the night somewhere else, and I told them she was coming home with me, so we gathered her things and headed out. As we walked into my building, Amy seemed to calm down a bit; the shaking in her hand had stopped. We reached the third floor, and standing in front of my door, I tried to fish my keys out of my pocket. Amy, however, tried the door and found it to be unlocked. She looked at me and, in a joking tone, said,

“It’s unlocked, I’m so proud of you.”

 As she walked inside. I looked up as I stood in the doorway, and a primal panic that I hadn’t felt in months flooded over me. I screamed,

“Wait, Amy, don’t—”

 but it was too late, the HideBehind was already upon her. Its long claws sliced her throat into ribbons and dug deep into her abdomen, splattering her blood and intestines all over the white walls. The creature stood over her as her lifeless, empty body fell to the ground like a sock puppet. I watched in horror from the doorway. I wanted to scream, I wanted to run, but the shock held me in place. When I finally regained control over my feet, I began to turn to flee down the hall, but before I could move, the HideBehind grabbed my back and flung me into the room, where I collided with the opposite wall, falling to the floor. I heard the door close. And out of the corner of my eye, I saw it, the HideBehind standing in the corner behind the door, like a sleep paralysis demon, it stood perfectly still, the corner itself seemed to grow darker with its presence, as if a dark fog was confined to just that corner. It was guarding the door; it had no plans to let me leave this room. But I didn’t care; my thoughts were only on Amy, her lifeless body lay in a pool of blood in the middle of my apartment.

With my back to the creature, I crawled over to her, held her, and wept. I don’t know how long I sat there, hours, probably days.  All the while, the HideBehind stood directly behind me, breathing down on me with its hot, wet breath. At some point, the engagement ring on the table caught my eye, and I crawled to reach it. Its cold, metallic shape rested in my hands as I stared at it, a memento of the life I will never have, the love that was taken from me, by the thing standing behind me. I slide the ring onto Amy’s cold finger, and I cried all the more. And that brings me to the present. Amy was killed over two weeks ago, and I am still trapped here with her murderer. Every moment, it tries to get me to look at it; it is ever near, both waking and sleeping, even as I write this, its humid breath blows along my neck, and from time to time, its long fingers wrap around my head and squeeze gently. I don’t know why I’m writing, partly to convince the world that I did not kill Amy. I wish beyond anything that I had never met her, for she would still be alive. I loved her, and the creature knew it. I’m convinced now that the HideBehind had been stalking me here in the city for months; I was just too blind to notice. It knew my habits, and when I made a mistake, it jumped on the chance. I look down at the rotten corpse of my beloved Amy, tears fill my eyes, it's my fault she's dead, but please know, I didn’t kill her. But I’m also writing this as a warning; there are strange things in the woods, horrible ancient things. Things the natives spoke about, things the pioneers saw, things we wrote off as fantasy, tall tales. I can assure you they are not. Stay out of the woods, the things that live there, in the shadows, under the pines, in the deepest darkest parts of the forests are real, and to step into their world is to agree to play by their rules. Don’t let what happened to me happen to you. I glance up slightly and smile as I see the noose hanging overhead. I placed it there days ago, but now I think I’m ready to use it, the foods been gone for weeks now, and every time I look at Amy’s corpse, all I think about is food. I’m not going there, and I refuse to give the HideBehind the satisfaction of killing me. I’m going out on my own terms, and in that way I win. The noose is my salvation. I’ll see Amy again very soon.

 

Epilogue

\[The following is taken from Det. Sherman’s report of the crime scene at the Bryson building on 03/05/2021\]

Myself \[Det. Rick Sherman\] and Det. Matthew Peterson responded to the call at the Bryson building at 1300 hours on March 5th. Apartment 362 was rented to a Mr. Nate Diaz. After the surrounding renters complained of an awful smell, the building manager, Mr. Patrick Bennett preformed a wellness check and found the scene. Two decaying bodies were in the room, one hanging by a rope, the body of Mr. Diaz, the other had been brutally disemboweled and belonged to a Ms. Amy Cranworth. Ms. Cranworth’s corpse was far more decayed than Mr. Diaz’s, indicating that she had been dead far longer. Notable with Diaz’s corpse is the fact that both of his eyes had been removed, presumably by himself; the eyes were not found at the scene. After inspecting the scene, it is the conclusion of both myself and Det. Peterson, that Mr. Diaz murdered Ms. Cranworth in a fit of rage, and seeing no way out, days later took his own life. The techs recovered a journal of sorts for Mr. Diaz’s laptop. It will be examined for any potential clues. \[relevant to the disappearance, possible point of disappearance\], Det. Peterson, however, noted an uneasy feeling in the room and noticed from the window some movement from down in the alley below. Det. Peterson announced he was going to take a look at it and headed out to do so.

\[This is the last known sighting of Det. Matthew Peterson, who remains unaccounted for, and for whom the search continues.\]",1,1771433376.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

Full name called out, 150 people staring, the prof basically suggesting I'd rather discuss dinner plans than Renaissance art. It was the single most embarrassing moment of my academic life and I was just starting to recover. I told myself: lay low, sit slightly less in the back, maybe actually skim the textbook once in a while. Solid plan. Great plan. I open the course portal this morning to check the assignment details and I swear my entire nervous system shut down for a second. The essay prompt is a 1200-word analytical piece on brushstroke techniques in the work of that specific painter. The exact one she was lecturing about when she called me out. I don't know if this is a coincidence or if she is personaly constructing my academic downfall but either way I am not okay.

I've been sitting in front of this Google Doc for two and a half hours. My word count is 47, and 30 of those are the header, my name, the date, and the course code. I watched four YouTube videos about Renaissance techniques, opened a JSTOR article that was 47 pages long and immediatley closed it, and read the first paragraph of three Wikipedia pages before my brain just gave up. At some point I made coffee. The coffee is cold. Every time I try to write a real sentence I hear her voice in my head and I physically freeze.

*P.S. I haven’t tried every single hiking group listed here, so please make sure that the group fits your expectations and check them out on instagram before registering. Below are my reviews of the groups I tried.*

—————————————————

**Reviews of groups I tried:**

[**mountleb\_wanderers**](https://www.instagram.com/mountleb_wanderers)

Great community, excellent guides and the organization is amazing! Very friendly people on hikes. Guides provide very insightful information about the areas visited and the different landmarks. People from different age groups join. They make some good tasting sfouf and coffee too :) Big shoutout to Elie, the founder, he's a great guy, very helpful, and amazing energy!

[**explorers.of.lebanon**](https://www.instagram.com/explorers.of.lebanon)

Great trails!! Alain (the founder) is an amazing guy! A true gem! Loved hearing about his experiences and talking to him. Very knowledgeable about different areas and shares a lot of information with the hikers about the different landmarks we pass through. Hikers are very friendly too. Would definitely go again!

[**lebanon.outdoor.activities**](https://www.instagram.com/lebanon.outdoor.activities)

Great and friendly guides, they make multiple hikes over the weekend. You get a manouche and coffee as part of your registration. Good overall experience!",13,1771433309.0,lebanon,2,1.0,False
1r887oa,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1r887oa/limited_time_offer_act_now_and_get_your_very_own/,🚨 LIMITED TIME OFFER! 🚨 ACT NOW AND GET YOUR VERY OWN GERMAN FRIEND™! 🚨,"**INTRODUCING:** One (1) slightly used 16-year-old German Nerd™ (Model: Sarcasm Deluxe Edition) NOW AVAILABLE for friendship opportunities in YOUR area!\*

\*Your area must be within reasonable timezone proximity to Germany. ""Reasonable"" is subject to interpretation by management. Management reserves the right to be unreasonable.

**PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS:**

* **Operating System:** Windows PC Master Race Edition (console peasants need not apply)\*\*
* **Language Settings:** Fluent in English, German, and Advanced Sarcasm™
* **Special Features:** Comes pre-loaded with excessive confidence, pwetty smawrt brain cells, and an industrial-grade sarcasm generator that CANNOT be turned off (warranty void if you try)

**WHAT'S IN THE BOX?**

* One (1) friend who WILL call you ""pookie"" whether you consent or not
* Unlimited\*\*\* access to conversations about:
   * Horror content that'll make you question your life choices
   * Creepypastas (vintage 2012 quality guaranteed)
   * True crime discussions (thanks to ex, batteries not included)
   * VIDEOGAMESSSSS (keyboard smashing sounds sold separately)
   * Writing (may contain traces of actual talent)
   * TV shows (opinions WILL be aggressively shared)
* Complimentary cute nicknames (non-negotiable, non-refundable)
* Premium sarcasm package (WARNING: May cause eye strain from excessive eye-rolling)

**PREFERRED COMPATIBILITY:**  
✅ Female friends mysteriously preferred (our scientists are still researching why)  
✅ Must handle industrial-strength sarcasm without crying  
✅ German speakers get VIP access\*\*\*\*  
✅ Must be capable of forming ACTUAL SENTENCES (if you message ""hey wyd"" you WILL be blocked faster than you can say ""but why :("" )

**⚠️ LEGAL DISCLAIMERS OUR LAWYERS FORCED US TO INCLUDE:**

\*Not responsible for hurt feelings caused by excessive sarcasm. Side effects may include: uncontrollable laughter, confusion about whether statements are serious or not, sudden urges to use :3 emoticons, and developing an inexplicable hatred for conversation abbreviations. This friend may spontaneously ghost you - not out of malice, but because your opening message was boring AF. ""Best"" friend title comes with mandatory quotation marks (non-negotiable as per legal statute 420.69). Friendship package does not include romantic benefits despite bi status - this is STRICTLY PLATONIC, you thirsty weirdos. German Friend™ may occasionally malfunction and speak entirely in German just to flex. Warranty void if you can't appreciate good horror content. Not suitable for people who unironically say ""doggo"" or ""heckin."" May contain nuts (the person, not allergens). Your friendship experience may vary based on how much coffee German Friend™ has consumed. We are not liable for any addiction to emoticons you may develop (especially :P ;3 >.<). The term ""somewhat prefer female friends"" is legally binding and we don't know what it means either. Timezone discrimination is not only allowed but encouraged. This product has been known to cause spontaneous outbursts of ""BRRRRRR"" when discussing video games. German Friend™ reserves the right to judge your taste in everything. No refunds, no exchanges, no takesie-backsies.

\*\* Console users will be mocked relentlessly. This is not a bug, it's a feature.

\*\*\* ""Unlimited"" is limited by German Friend™'s attention span and mood

\*\*\*\* VIP access just means you get roasted in German AND English

**TESTIMONIALS:**

* ""He called me pookie for three months straight. I've never recovered."" - ""Best"" Friend
* ""The sarcasm... it never stops... send help >.<"" - Anonymous survivor
* ""10/10 would get emotionally attached and then wonder why he's not responding to my 'sup' message again"" - Rejected Applicant

**HOW TO APPLY:**  
Simply slide into DMs with something that DOESN'T make me want to gouge my eyes out with a rusty spoon! Bonus points if you can match my sarcasm levels without having a mental breakdown! ;3

**CALL NOW! Or don't. I'm not your mom. But seriously, I'm bored AF so... :P**

*This advertisement has been approved by the International Coalition of Lonely Nerds (ICLN) and violates several international friendship treaties. German Friend™ is a registered trademark of Sarcasm Industries GmbH. Please friend responsibly.*



\^(Terms and conditions apply. Must be 13+ to apply due to Reddit TOS. Not available in stores. Some assembly of friendship required. Results not typical. This is not financial advice.

1r8860l,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngelesSocialClub/comments/1r8860l/visiting_from_korea_feb_2026_lowkey_coffeechat/,Visiting from Korea (Feb 20–26) — low-key coffee/chat near DTLA / South Park (flexible day),"Hey! I’m visiting LA from Korea and I’ll be in town **Feb 20–26**. I’d love to meet a few people while I’m here, but I’m not super comfortable “hosting” a big meetup—so I’m keeping this low-pressure and flexible.

A bit about me:

* **31M**, work at a startup
* Interested in **AI**
* Planning to launch an **app service in the US** soon

What I’m looking for:

* **Coffee + chat** (or a short walk nearby)
* **60–90 minutes**
* 1:1 is totally fine, or a tiny group (**2–4 people**)
* Prefer a public place close to where I’m staying: **DTLA / South Park-ish (90015 area)**

Possible meetup spots (public + easy):

* Starbucks: **1111 S Grand Ave (90015)**
* Hotel lobby lounge area: **Hotel Figueroa (939 S Figueroa St / 90015)** But I’m very open to suggestions—if you have a better public spot around DTLA/South Park that feels comfortable for a first meet, please propose it.

If you’re down, comment or DM me with:

1. Which day/time works for you between **Feb 20–26**
2. Your preferred spot/area (or your suggestion)

No pressure at all—happy to keep it casual, and chatting online only is also totally fine.",1,1771433206.0,LosAngelesSocialClub,0,0.6,False

We’re inviting students to take the [Student Watch Survey](https://nacs.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_a03u7nO8wL70fvE). I takes about 15 minutes, totally confidential, and is honestly pretty painless. It asks about the course materials you use (and pay for), how you feel about different class formats, and a few other things that help us understand what is working for you and... what... isn’t maybe working so well...

Here’s the part you might like: Everyone who completes the survey gets entered for a chance to win a $50 gift card. There’s also a $1,000 grand prize up for grabs across all participating schools. Not a bad potential return on less than a quarter‑hour investment.

**Why do we care so much about your input?**

Because your experiences help us! We need your feedback so we can see what is trending and to compare Fanshawe to other colleges in Canada and the U.S. We rely on this info when making decisions about course materials, supports, and overall student experience. In short: everyone who participates genuinely helps to shape things here and at other institutions too.

**👉 If you’re up for it, here’s the link:**  [https://nacs.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_a03u7nO8wL70fvE](https://nacs.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_a03u7nO8wL70fvE)

The survey is open until March 6, 2026 (only two more weeks).

Thanks for taking the time, and good luck if you decide to jump in. We would love to see one of our own Falcons walk away with that grand prize!

I've recently tried to get into the coffee industry (even if it's kind of weird here in Italy). I've done a basic and advanced training with an SCA trainer, and got an IBC. Then I started looking for a job (both near my place and in Padua) ,and got rejected every time for 2 main reasons: no service experience or ""not aligned with us"" cause of the training I got (they see me as someone who wants to work there just for 6-12 months, get some experience and then leave to a better environment — they're not wrong tho).  
That said, I was thinking about getting the WHV to Australia, as a couple of people I know tried that, and could be able to land a coffee shop job w/o experience, as their main goal was to work in a completely different field. For those who already tried this route, or are currently working in hospitality in Australia: how realistic is to land an entry-level cafe' job (even if starting as waiter or dishwasher) with training but not service experience?
