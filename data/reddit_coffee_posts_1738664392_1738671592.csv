1ihgc0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ihgc0z/aita_for_not_being_more_involved_in_my_moms_new/,AITA for not being more involved in my mom's new family and not taking on a role as an older brother?,"I (18m) live with my paternal grandparents and I'm in college. I live 25 minutes from my mom so not we're not too far from each other. During the week I'm in school and on the weekends I work. I make sure to take a couple of hours to meet mom for a late lunch or a coffee or something. But that's not what this is about.

My dad died when I was 7 and it was me and mom until I moved out. A few months before I moved out she had started dating a guy called Brad. I met him, I met his kids and they were fine. They moved in about three months ago and now my mom and Brad are engaged. Brad's parents moved to live close to their son and grandkids so they're a few houses away from my mom and I met them twice.

I don't have a whole lot to do with Brad or his kids. I have been asked to babysit a few times and I always said no because I had other plans. My mom seemed okay with that. Though she has mentioned a few times that she'd love for me to spend more time with them and stuff. I do see them occasionally but nowhere near as much as I see my mom.

My mom's birthday was the other weekend and she had a small party at her house to celebrate. I was there and I interacted with everyone just fine. But my focus was on mom.

During the party she and Brad left the house for a few to pick up her gift. Brad's dad was with the kids and his mom approached me. She told me the kids had been looking forward to spending time with me and instead I was interacting with others more and focused only on mom. This was the second time I met this woman. She told me Brad had hoped he'd get to spend some time with me as well. She said it looked like I was only interesting in maintaining a relationship with mom and not on building my family. I asked her what business it was of hers and she told me her family are the ones involved. She said my grandparents had set a bad precedent by not claiming Brad's kids as honorary grandkids and embracing the fact mom had moved on from dad. This woman told me I should be doing more though. That if I love my mom I will love her family and accept them into my family.

I moved away from her so there wouldn't be a fight or anything and once mom and Brad were back she didn't try to approach me again.

I didn't say anything to mom and we went for lunch the week after. But after our lunch Brad's mom texted me (she got my number from my mom or Brad) and she scolded me or whatever you'd call it, for meeting with mom for time but not organizing something for us all to do and spending the time I spend with her with mom's family. She said it could be as easy as going to mom's house and being a part of the family and being the big brother to the kids.

I told my mom about the stuff Brad's mom had said. Brad came in as we were talking and he said he'd speak to them but that he would love if I was more involved. He said he'd love to be a father figure to me and to have a kid as good as me have some kind of sibling-type relationship with his kids. He said not to babysit but even to hang out so they can say they have an older brother. My mom said she was sorry about the stuff Brad's mom had done and she asked me how I felt about maybe being a big brother. I told her I'd see what happens with Brad and his kids but I wasn't planning to sign up for being an older brother. I told her they'd probably seem more like cousins to me.

She was upset. Then Brad's mom texted again (and I quickly blocked her). She asked why I had to go to her son like that when she was trying to talk some sense into me and help her family.

I‚Äôm reaching out because I‚Äôve been struggling with something quite strange, and I can‚Äôt seem to find any explanations for it. Maybe someone here has had a similar experience or knows what could be going on.

For some time now, I‚Äôve noticed that certain smells trigger an intense physical reaction in me. The most problematic are:
	‚Ä¢	The smell of various baked goods,
especially sandwiches
	‚Ä¢	Freshly baked goods (eg pretzels)
	‚Ä¢	The scent of cooked coffee
	‚Ä¢	Tomatoes (particularly irritating)
	‚Ä¢	Many other foods (especially industrial produced stuff)

Whenever I‚Äôm exposed to these ‚Äûsmells‚Äú (it‚Äôs not about the scent tho), my saliva changes‚Äîit becomes thick and sticky instead of fluid and wet, making my mouth feel uncomfortably dry. At the same time, my face starts to burn and feels dry and tight, almost as if my skin is reacting to the airborne particles.

I have never heard of anything like this before, and it‚Äôs becoming a serious issue. I‚Äôve stopped going to caf√©s and bakeries, and I can‚Äôt eat at cafeterias anymore because the air alone triggers my symptoms.

Has anyone ever experienced something similar? Could this be an unusual form of allergy or sensitivity? I would be grateful for any insights or advice!

A nameless organization offered to pay for it, and when I accepted, I started to hear things no person should ever have to hear.","

Before I start, I‚Äôd like to be as transparent as possible.

Twenty years ago, I was convicted of manslaughter. 

Framed by an organization that took my need and my vulnerability and twisted it to their own ends.

I can‚Äôt right my wrongs, and I know that. I‚Äôll live with the consequences of trusting them for the rest of my life. 

Now that I‚Äôm free, though, I've finally decided to put the truth of what happened to me out into the world, which boils down to this:

The organization implanted something that allowed me to hear sounds that are normally well out of reach from our perception. Sounds that the human mind wasn‚Äôt designed to withstand - an imperceptible cacophony that is occurring all around you as you read this, you just don't know it. It‚Äôs occurring around me as I write this as well, and although I can‚Äôt physically hear it, I can still *feel* it. It's faint, but I know it's there. 

And once I came to understand what they did, they made sure to silence me. 

\------------------

***11/01/02 - Ten days before the incident.*** 

*‚ÄúReady?‚Äù*

I nodded, which was only kind of a lie. I was *always* ready for this part of my week to be over, but I was never quite ready for the god-awful sensation.

Hewitt clicked the remote, and the implant in my left temple whirred to life. It always started gently. A quiet buzzing. Irritating, but only mildly so. Inevitably, however, the sound and the vibration crescendoed. What started as a soft hum grew into a furious droning, like a cicada vibrating angry verses from the inside of my skull.

I gritted my teeth and closed my eyes tight.

*Only a few more seconds.*

Finally, when I could barely tolerate it anymore, a climatic shockwave radiated from the device, causing my jaw to clack from the force. With the reverberation dissipating as it moved further down my body, the device stilled.

A sigh of relief spilled from my lips.

I opened my eyes and saw green light reflecting off of Hewitt‚Äôs thick glasses from the implant‚Äôs remote. In layman‚Äôs terms, I‚Äôd learned that meant ‚Äúall good‚Äù.

Hewitt smiled, creasing his weathered cheeks.

*‚ÄúThe implant is primed. Let me collect my materials so we can get this show on the road.‚Äù*

The stout Italian physician shot up from his desk chair and turned to face the wooden cabinets that lined the back of his office. Despite his advanced age and bulky frame, he was still remarkably spry.

*‚ÄúThanks. By the way, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be ‚Äòready‚Äô for that, Doc. For any of this, actually. You can probably stop asking. Save your breath, I mean.‚Äù*

As I spoke, it felt like heavy grains of sand were swimming around my molars. I swished the pebbles onto my tongue and spat them into my hand, frowning at the chalky crystals in my palm.

*‚ÄúJesus. Cracked another filling. Does the Audiology department have a P.O. box I can forward my dental bills to?‚Äù*

He chuckled weakly as he turned back towards me. The old doctor was only half-listening, now preoccupied with assembling the familiar experimental set up. Carefully, he placed a Buddha statue, a spray bottle of clear liquid, four half-foot tall metal pillars, and a capped petri dish on the desk.

Absentmindedly, I rubbed the scar above my temple. Most of the time, I just pretended like I could perceive the outline of the dime-sized implant. The delusion helped me feel in control.

But I wasn‚Äôt in control. Not completely, at least. 

I shared control with the remote in Hewitt‚Äôs hand, especially when *his* part of the implant was active. The experimental portion. Suppressing the existential anxiety that came with split dominance was challenging. I wasn‚Äôt used to my sensations being a democracy.

The concession felt worth it, though. The implant restored my hearing, and Hewitt installed it free, with a single string attached: I had to play ball with these weekly sessions, testing the part of the implant that I wasn‚Äôt allowed to know anything about, per our agreement.

On the desk, the doctor was arranging the metal pillars into a small square. Once satisfied with the dimensions of the square, he‚Äôd position the statue, the spray bottle, and the petri dish into the center of it. Then, testing would finally begin.

*‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶are your other patients tolerating this thing okay?‚Äù* I asked, fishing for a few reassuring words.

The doctor looked up from his designs, pointing a brown iris and a bushy white eyebrow at me.

*‚ÄúThere are no other patients like you, David.‚Äù*

He paused for a moment, maintaining unbroken eye contact, as if to highlight the importance of what just came out of his mouth. Abruptly, he severed his gaze and resumed fidgeting with the metal pillars, but he continued to talk.

*‚ÄúYour case, this situation, its‚Ä¶unique. A marriage of circumstances. When the brain infection took your hearing, any model of cochlear implant could have been used to repair it. But you couldn‚Äôt afford them, not even the cheapest one. At the exact same time, my lab was looking for an elegant solution to our own problem. A friend of a friend was aware of both of our dilemmas. You needed an implant for free, and we needed a‚Ä¶‚Äù*

He stopped talking mid-sentence and swiveled his head around the setup, examining it from different angles and elevations, but he made no further modifications. It seemed like everything was in its right place. Contented, he sat back down in his chair, and briefly, Hewitt was motionless. He looked either lost in his thoughts, captivated by things he‚Äôd rather not say out loud, or he was resting and not thinking about anything at all.

Either way, it took a moment for him to remember he had been explaining something to me. My confused facial expression probably sped that process along.

*‚ÄúRight. We needed a‚Ä¶‚Äù* he trailed off, wringing his hand to convey he was searching for the correct word in English.

*‚ÄúWe needed an ‚Äòoperator‚Äô. Someone to tell us that the device worked like we had designed it to. I wouldn‚Äôt say this was an elegant solution, but we‚Äôre both getting something out of the deal, I suppose.‚Äù*

In the nine months since the implantation, this was by far the most Hewitt ever divulged about the deeper contents of their arrangement.

As requested, he didn‚Äôt check if I was ready this time; instead, he winked and clicked another button on the remote.

*‚ÄúWhat do you hear?‚Äù*

Instantly, I could hear sound emanating from each of the stationary objects in the middle of the square. Nothing moved, and yet a loud, rhythmic drumming filled my ears. Despite being able to tell the noise was coming from directly in front of me, it sounded incredibly distant, too. Like it was echoing from the depths of a massive cave system before it reached me standing at the cave‚Äôs entrance.

What started a single drum eventually became a frenzied ensemble. Over only a few seconds, hundreds of drum rolls layered over each other until the chaotic pounding caused my head to throb. The Budha was grinning, but that‚Äôs not what I heard. I heard the marble figure screaming at me, its voice made of deafening thunder rather than anything recognizably human.

I cradled my temple with my palm and grimaced, shouting an answer to Hewitt‚Äôs question.

*‚ÄúAll three things are drumming, same as always, Doc.‚Äù*

He clicked the remote again, and like the flick of a switch, the objects became silent immediately. 

*‚ÄúThank you, David. Head to the lobby, grab a book and have Annemarie make you a cup of coffee. In about an hour, I‚Äôll call you back. We‚Äôll repeat the procedure, I‚Äôll deactivate the implant, and you‚Äôll be done for the week.‚Äù*

My legs pulled my body out of the chair without a shred of hesitation. I was dying to leave the office and get some fresh air. As my hand gripped the doorknob, however, Hewitt‚Äôs words rang in my head.

*There are no other patients like you, David.*

I turned back to the doctor, who was now spraying down the statue with the unknown liquid.

‚Äú*Hewitt‚Ä¶you mentioned something when we first met in the hospital - about our contract. You said that, eventually, you‚Äôd be able to explain to me what we‚Äôre doing here. I know I‚Äôve never brought it up before now. I think I used to be more scared of knowing than I was of being left in the dark, and, well‚Ä¶I‚Äôve sort of been feeling the opposite way, as of late. Is that option still on the table?‚Äù*

Although he interrupted what he was doing, he didn‚Äôt meet my gaze. Instead, he kept his focus on the statue and muttered a halfhearted response.

‚Äú*I can appeal to the board. No promises, David.‚Äù*

When I returned an hour later, the objects and the pillars were in their same positions, but the Buddha had a new, glistening shine on its marble skin.

As the device activated, the horrible drumming reappeared, but only from the spray bottle and the petri dish. The statue remained eerily quiet. 

Hewitt clicked the remote one last time. The implant beeped three times, and then released one last shockwave, weaker than the one that came with ‚Äúpriming‚Äù his part of the device. This supposedly meant the implant had completely deactivated its experimental portion. I was told the designers never intended me to experience the drumming outside a controlled setting.

*‚ÄúWell, that's all for today. You have my cell phone number. I may not always be able to answer, but call me if there are any issues. Feel free to leave a message, as well.‚Äù*

He shook my hand, forced a smile, and then waved me out of his office.

As I turned to leave, my eyes fell on the gleaming statue still sitting on his desk. Although the silence better matched the figure‚Äôs smile, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel like it was still screaming, berating me for being so na√Øve.

I just couldn‚Äôt hear it anymore.

\------------------

Below, I‚Äôve typed out what I can recall of the messages I left for Hewitt leading up to my inditement. 

Here's what I remember: 

\------------------

***11/05/02 - Six days before the incident.***

***Me:*** *Hey Hewitt. First off, everything is OK. I know I‚Äôve never called you on your cell before, so I don‚Äôt want you to think that‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt want you to think there‚Äôs a big emergency or something. I mean‚Ä¶there kind of was, but I‚Äôm alright.*

*I was in a car accident. Drunk driver fell asleep at the wheel, swerved into traffic and I T-boned him. Not sure he walked away from the wreck‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm hanging in there, all things considered. Just a broken rib and a nasty concussion on my end. Banged the side of my head against the steering wheel pretty hard.*

*Still hearing everything OK, so I‚Äôm assuming the device is working fine, but I figured with the head injury‚Ä¶I figured you might want to know. Especially since our next appointment isn't for another week.*

*Give me a call back at* \[xxx-xxx-xxxx\] *when you can.*

\------------------

***11/06/02 - Five days before.***

***Me:*** *Got your machine again, I guess. Haven‚Äôt heard from you, so I suppose you aren‚Äôt too worried about me‚Ä¶or the implant. Which is good! Which is good...*

*But‚Ä¶uhh‚Ä¶maybe you should be. I am‚Ä¶after last night.*

*I started‚Ä¶hearing the drumming at home. Just little bits of it, here and there. Much quieter than usual.* 

*I was sitting at my computer‚Ä¶and I heard it in the background of the music I was listening to. It just kind of‚Ä¶appeared. I‚Äôm not sure how long it was there before I noticed it. At first, I thought I was hearing things, but as I walked through my apartment, it became louder. Muffled, though. Felt like it was coming from multiple places rather than one. Eventually, I thought I tracked it to a drawer in my kitchen, but when I pulled it opened, it stopped‚Ä¶all of a sudden.*

*I guess it could be the concussion, but the noise is so‚Ä¶distinctive. An invisible jackhammer banging into invisible concrete, like I‚Äôve told you.*

*Anyway‚Ä¶just call me back.*

*Oh! Before I forget, have you heard from the board? I‚Äôd‚Ä¶I‚Äôd really like to know what this thing does. In addition to my hearing, I mean.*

\------------------

***11/08/02 - Three days before.***

***Me:*** *Doc - where the fuck are you?*

*‚Ä¶sorry. Didn‚Äôt mean to lose my temper. I‚Ä¶I haven‚Äôt slept.*

*Can the implant‚Ä¶turn on by itself? I‚Äôm‚Ä¶I‚Äôm definitely hearing‚Ä¶whatever I‚Äôm being trained to hear.*

*It‚Äôs‚Ä¶it‚Äôs everywhere. Comes and goes at random. Or‚Ä¶maybe I‚Äôm just starting to hear it when I face it a certain way. My head‚Ä¶it feels like an antenna. If I turn my head up and to the left‚Ä¶it all goes away. Any other position, though, and I can hear the drumming. Like I said - everywhere. On my phone, my clothes, the walls‚Ä¶*

*I‚Ä¶I heard it inside myself, too.*

*I managed to fall asleep, but I guess I relaxed, and my muscles relaxed and‚Ä¶well, my head must have turned, because I could hear it again.* 

*Loud as hell...from the inside of my mouth.* 

*I‚Äôm not proud, but I‚Ä¶I kind of freaked out. Put my hands in my mouth and just‚Ä¶just started scraping. I‚Ä¶I wanted it out of me. Dug at my gums‚Ä¶its really bad.*

*I can‚Äôt drive, either. I mean, I can try, but I feel like I‚Äôll just get in another wreck, trying to keep my head up and to the left while driving. And‚Ä¶what if it still happens? Even though my heads in the right place?*

*Please‚Ä¶please call me.*

\------------------

***11/10/02 - One day before.***

***Me:*** *‚Ä¶I‚Äôve started to feel it all, Hewitt.*

*The drumming‚Ä¶it‚Äôs moving over everything. It‚Äôs* ***in*** *everything. It breaks you, and then it rebuilds you again. And now, I have only one sense, not five.*

*I don‚Äôt see, I don‚Äôt taste, smell, touch‚Ä¶and I certainly don‚Äôt hear. Not anymore.*

*But I feel the current.* 

*I feel it writhing and pounding and slipping and fucking and expanding and consuming and living and dying over every‚Ä¶****goddamned****‚Ä¶thing.*

*It speaks to me. Not in a language or a tongue. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a tide. It ebbs and flows.*

*It sings wordless songs to me‚Ä¶and I understand, now.* 

*I thought you cursed me, Hewitt. But all transitions cause pain. I mean, how do you turn a liquid into a gas?*

*You boil it. And when it bubbles its tiny pleading screams, you certainly don‚Äôt stop.*

*You turn up the heat.*

\------------------

***11/11/02 - Day of the incident***

***Me:*** *Hello?* **(shouting)**

***Hewitt:*** *David, are you at home?*

***Me:*** *Doc - oh thank God. You‚Ä¶you gotta help me‚Ä¶oh God‚Ä¶it‚Äôs‚Ä¶it‚Äôs everywhere‚Ä¶I‚Äôm nothing‚Ä¶I‚Äôm nothing‚Ä¶* **(shouting)**

***Hewitt:*** *Can you get to the-***(I cut him off)**

***Me:*** *Please‚Ä¶please make it stop. Why doesn‚Äôt it ever‚Ä¶why doesn‚Äôt it ever stop‚Ä¶* **(Crying, shouting)**

***Hewitt:*** *David, I need you to calm down.*

***Me:*** *Am I hearing death, Hewitt? Can God hear what I can hear, Doc, or are they too scared?* **(Laughing, shouting)**

***Hewitt:*** *LISTEN.* **(shouting)**

***Me:*** ‚Ä¶ **(line goes dead)**

***Hewitt:*** *You‚Äôre hearing the microscopic, David. It was all just supposed to be a novel way to test the effectiveness of anti-infectious agents. Once they stopped moving, we know the medication killed them. We stood to make a lot of money off of the technology, but we couldn't prove it worked. Not until you. You‚Äôve‚Ä¶you‚Äôve helped so many people, David‚Ä¶*

***Me:*** **(quietly)** *I‚Äôve been able‚Ä¶able to hear, able to feel‚Ä¶the billions of living things‚Ä¶moving around‚Ä¶on my skin‚Ä¶inside me‚Ä¶everywhere‚Ä¶*

***Hewitt:*** *Don't call an ambulance, don't call the police. We're coming to pick you up.*

\------------------

I don't remember much from that night other than this conversation. I can vaguely recall Hewitt arriving at my apartment, remote in hand. He examines my head, and I'm fading in and out of consciousness. 

When I fully come to, I'm lying on my couch, holding a gun I'd never seen before. A few steps away is Hewitt's corpse. 

And I start crying - not out of fear or confusion, out of relief. 

It's finally quiet. Silent as the grave. The endless drumming of infinite microorganisms crawling around me and within me had vanished. 

My weeping is interrupted by a man rounding the corner into my living room. He's well dressed with dark blue eyes, and he walks over to sit next to me, stepping over Hewitt as he does. 

He introduces himself as Hewitt. Tells me the body won't be needing the name anymore, so it's his now. 

*""Listen, David, we have some new terms. You can still keep the device, meaning you can keep your hearing. Its fixed now, too. You won't be hearing anything you weren't meant to hear from now until the day you die.""*

*""As with any fair deal, I have some conditions. You can't tell anyone what you heard, and you have to take the fall for the killing of the nameless body in front of you. If you do those things, you'll be safe.""*

*""Fail to abide by those conditions, and we're turning the noise back on. All of it. And we'll leave it on, up until the moment you choke on your own tongue. Not a second sooner.""*

*""Do you understand, David?""*

\------------------

I agreed to the terms then, but I've had a little change of heart. Jail gave me perspective. 

You see, the punishment behind incarceration is that you lose your autonomy. That's your incentive to reform. Serve your time, play by the rules and hey, maybe we'll give you your agency back. Maybe you'll have an opportunity to own your body again. 

It makes you realize that agency and autonomy are the only things that really have value in this world. Without them, you have nothing. 

And what is this implant, but another jail? I've wanted to speak up for so damn long, but the threat of being subjected to the drumming again has kept me silent. 

Well, I've changed. I'm tired of just settling for what they'll give me. I want my goddamned agency back. 

So, to the creators of the implant, consider this my resignation from our contract. In addition, I have a few choice words. I am relying on the internet to carry them to you, wherever you are.

On the other hand, some believe moderation is key and that there's no harm as long as it's not excessive.

1ihg8eo,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction/comments/1ihg8eo/this_manifesting_method_always_works/,This Manifesting Method ALWAYS works!,"Don't let anyone tell you can't be or do or have anything you want - because you absolutely can! I'm the proof of that. I used to think LOA was impossible but then I realised I wasn't understanding it. I've gone from someone who was full of doubt and disbelief to a money magnet. Like most people I followed¬†all the LOA YouTubers but nothing was improving, and I used to read forums like this one for hours - I was worried that half the stories I was reading were made up or just scripting and the other half were just by people who could make it work and it just would't work for me! Now I've found a simple method that I know works - I know it does because now I'm not searching for answers, I have what I need.¬†

If it works for me it can work for anyone - I was someone earning a small amount per hour to someone who sometimes makes nearly six figures per year, sometimes more, and I've just had a pay rise. And I'm never without job offers through emails. It might not be millions I'm earning, but it's a quantum leap compared to where I was and what I first thought was possible. I want to help you drop the fake ideas which can seriously slow you down (I wasted years and thousands of pounds on workshops from manifesting teachers who wanted to take money from me more than they wanted to help).

The game changer for me is the confidence evoke which is still one of my favourite practices it's just total magic and it moves your reality at light speed. It's so simple, it's not a mental thing, it's all about the feeling. It's not about creating your reality by repeating words or robotically affirming like a lot of people are saying to do but I think that just keeps you away from what you want. What confidence evoking is is it's stepping one step at a time into the feeling state now. You don't try to visualize something impossible. You start with small steps of things that are easy to believe, such as times you got a free coffee or you found money on the street or someone bought you a surprise present. You keep on evoking the feeling and the more you do it, the process says (and it always works), the more actual real life experiences which match this feeling you evoke.¬†

Then, you're able to make the big leaps. The main difference is you make the visualization about the now not about trying to manifest something in the future.¬†

So what I did was start with confidence evoking times I'd felt rich. When I started I felt so poor so this seemed impossible. But I started to clear my mind and really focus on any time at all I'd felt even slightly rich. At first, it was a comment someone had made years before about me having a rich vibe. I held onto that, wrote it down, and kept coming back to it. Just like I read it then began to multiply and soon I recalled another time I'd felt rich. Then, the next stage was a friend offered to buy me a coffee. This too I wrote down. My wealth vibe had gone up a level, highlighted by the manifesting of the coffee. And this is how I went on. The key was that I confidence evoked the feeling I felt at the time until I started to feel that wealthy hit a lot more often.

I want to say that my career wages have only gone up since doing this practice, too, so I totally see how it's due to that. Being good at this is all about practice. Everyone I've met on here who confidence evokes gets results, it's like a science. The only people who don't are the ones who give up too soon or they don't even try it properly. Additionally a huge tip is to meditate first. Doing focal-point meditation (from week one) first clears your mind otherwise the mind is too complicated to focus and evoke the feelings. ¬†

And another thing, confidence evoking is also one of the best practices ever for changing/upgrading your looks and is like an instant cosmetic procedure except it's 100% effective, has no side effects, is non-invasive and best of all is 100% free! Firstly I got over body dysmorphia using the work and now I feel consistently attractive however we could all feel even better. I often say how I carry a small notepad and pen in my bag so I'm ready to confidence evoke whenever I'm going to a meeting and need to refresh my look instantly!",2,1738671066.0,lawofattraction,0,1.0,False

As the title says. In the last few days, I've become really worried and need to be doing SOMETHING to feel like I'm preparing as best as I can for whatever might be on the horizon. I found this sub, and it's been really helpful. I know I'm late to the game, but better late than never, I hope. I found [this post by u/hailsatanhousewife](https://www.reddit.com/user/hailsatanhousewife/) particularly motivating and useful. Still, I feel like I'm working against a clock, and I'm completely overwhelmed and finding it hard to focus and zoom in on what's really crucial.

I'm trying to prep for myself (41F) and husband (39M), no kids, no pets. We live in an area where tornados are an occasional threat and heatwaves are a real concern in the summer. While I'm getting started for just us, if SHTF, I can definitely see us becoming a landing place for some our family, but I'm trying to push off that particular concern for later while I'm still getting started.

Our plan is to ""bug in"" as long as possible. We have our own home and have a fairly large, dry, partially finished basement for storage. There are some windows in the basement but it's mostly dark, and some storage areas have no natural light (I'm hoping this is relevant to food storage). We have a standard fridge and one medium-sized chest freezer. There is a full bathroom in the basement. 

Our budget is flexible. I'm trying to be reasonable, though, and while my husband is supporting of my prepping thoughts, he's not quite on the same page in terms of scale or how ""far to go"" with it, yet. I'm more of a ""plan for all scenarios"" and ""better to have and not need, than need and not have"" type of person than he is.

So far, in the last week I've purchased some backups of (maybe a few months' supply):

Household / Pharmacy

* feminine products
* deodorant
* toothbrush heads
* toothpaste
* shampoo/conditioner
* body wash
* razors
* OTC medications
* one large pack of TP (we also have a bidet to be installed)
* dishwasher soap
* hand soap
* laundry detergent (liquid and a backup of sheets)
* first aid supplies

Food

* rice
* dried beans
* coffee
* tuna packets
* flour
* dried pasta
* egg noodles

Obviously, I know this is only a start. I'm trying to stick to only items we currently use and buy regularly. My next trip out I think I will get a few wire shelves and some cases of water, some more shelf-stable staple foods. I want to begin picking up a few extra items on each shopping trip, which is about once a week. 

I'm hopeful that a dark, cool, dry basement will be fine for storage, and the water will last if undisturbed. To my knowledge (knock wood), we don't have any critters down there aside from some spiders. 

The preservation of this stash is my main confusion right now. I don't want our food products to go bad while in storage. I'll store everything at least a few inches off the ground as much as possible. **Do I need to invest in additional food storage containers like** [**food-grade storage bins**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HT6HN8B/?coliid=I3M7LZU1M4IK5&colid=283C6S54ODLHO&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it)**,** [**airtight containers**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093T41KKF/?coliid=IV02XP59OI6KR&colid=283C6S54ODLHO&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it_im&th=1)**,** [**mylar bags**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SLFNY8V/?coliid=I2V8EJS3N1OTU0&colid=283C6S54ODLHO&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it&th=1)**,** [**water purification tablets**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FFQN924/?coliid=IUSTYOHT5CY57&colid=283C6S54ODLHO&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it&th=1)**, desiccants, a vacuum sealer? Is it fine to keep some tried foods in their original containers, like beans or pasta in a plastic bag, or should I repackage things to be more stable?** 

I also feel compelled to make us ""bug out"" bags and ""to-go bins"" as the other user suggested, but I'm trying to pace myself right now.

1ihg6lh,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ihg6lh/when_the_walls_whisper_part_1/,When the walls whisper (Part 1),"
I don‚Äôt really know how to start this.

  I guess I should introduce myself first. My name is Ezra, I‚Äôm 27, and I work as an overnight security guard at an office building. It‚Äôs not exactly a dream job, but it pays my bills, and I don‚Äôt have to talk to people much. Most nights, I sit in a booth, watching security monitors cycle through dimly lit hallways and empty conference rooms. There‚Äôs a rhythm to it‚Äîcheck the screens, drink some gas station coffee, count down the hours until my shift ends.

I‚Äôve always liked working nights. The quiet. The stillness.

But lately, the quiet doesn‚Äôt feel empty anymore.

  It started small. I‚Äôd catch movement in the corner of my eye‚Äîjust a flicker on the monitor, like someone had passed through the frame an instant before I looked. A shadow in the breakroom. A shape at the edge of the stairwell. At first, I brushed it off. It‚Äôs easy to see things that aren‚Äôt really there when you‚Äôre running on bad coffee and two hours of sleep.

But then, things started happening at home, too. 

  At first, it was just the little things‚Äîthe feeling of being watched when I turned my back, the prickle of unease crawling up my spine in my own apartment. The TV would switch channels on its own, always to static, even though I never left the remote anywhere near me. I‚Äôd wake up to find my bedroom door open when I was sure I‚Äôd closed it. Once, I came home and found every cabinet in my kitchen wide open, doors gaping like silent mouths. I told myself I must have left them that way. That I‚Äôd been careless.

Then, one night, I heard whispering.

  I live alone, and my upstairs neighbor works the early shift‚Äîby the time I get home, his apartment is dead silent. But as I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, I heard it. Soft, almost like breathing. A voice, just on the edge of understanding, murmuring from the dark corner of my room. I held my breath, trying to convince myself I was imagining it.

Then it said my name.

  A low whisper, stretched out and drawn thin, curling against my ear like someone was right beside me.

  I didn‚Äôt move. I didn‚Äôt breathe. I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, waiting for the voice to come again.

  But the room was silent. And somehow, that was worse.

  That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing this.

  I need to put it down somewhere. Maybe if I see it all written out, it‚Äôll make more sense.

  I live alone in a small apartment‚Äînot much bigger than a box. One bedroom, a tiny kitchen, and a bathroom with a sink that leaks no matter how many times I twist the knobs shut. The walls are thin enough that sometimes, when I have the night off, I hear my upstairs neighbor pacing at night, the dull ""thud-thud-thud"" of his footsteps moving back and forth, back and forth. I don‚Äôt know his name.

  I don‚Äôt have a lot of visitors. I don‚Äôt sleep much, either‚Äînever have.

  Even as a kid, I used to lie awake for hours, staring at the ceiling, listening to the house settle in the dark. The groan of pipes. The creak of floorboards shifting under invisible weight. I used to imagine someone was walking around downstairs, moving through the kitchen, standing at the bottom of the staircase.

  I think that‚Äôs because I grew up in a house that was never quiet.

  My mom‚Äîshe had rules. Not the normal kind, like making your bed or saying ‚Äúplease‚Äù and ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù No, her rules were different. ""Don‚Äôt leave mirrors uncovered at night."" ""Never open the door if someone knocks past midnight."" And the big one‚Äî""if you ever hear your name whispered in an empty room, never, ever answer.""

  She believed in things. Spirits, bad energy, ghosts. She never said those words exactly, but I knew that‚Äôs what she meant. I remember waking up some nights to find her standing in the hallway, whispering under her breath, rubbing something along the doorframes. A white, powdery substance.

I never asked what it was.

I didn‚Äôt want to know.

  One night, after my mom had finished whatever ritual she was doing with the powder around the doorframes, she sat down at the kitchen table. Her eyes were distant, like she was staring through everything in the room. I was supposed to be asleep, but I couldn‚Äôt help myself‚Äîsometimes, I‚Äôd watch her when she didn‚Äôt know. This night, she finally spoke. ""There are things you can‚Äôt see, Ezra,"" she said, her voice soft, almost sad. ‚ÄúThings that follow you. They watch.‚Äù She paused, her eyes flicking toward the hallway, as though she were expecting something to step out of the shadows. I asked her what she meant, but she didn‚Äôt answer right away. When she did, her words were careful, measured, like she was telling me something I wasn‚Äôt supposed to know. ""If you ever hear your name, even when no one's around... don't answer, Ezra. You don't know what might be on the other side."" Her voice was almost a whisper by the end, like she was afraid someone‚Äîor something‚Äîmight hear. I didn‚Äôt understand then, but it stuck with me. In the back of my mind, I always wondered what she was really afraid of.

  My dad, on the other hand, thought she was crazy. He was a mean drunk, the kind that never really sobers up. He‚Äôd come home late, clattering around in the kitchen, slamming cabinets, muttering under his breath about money or work or nothing at all. My mom would sit at the table, staring past him, her hands folded neatly in her lap.

  I had a little sister, too. Molly. She was five years younger than me, small and pale with wide brown eyes. She followed me everywhere. I was protective of her‚ÄîI had to be. 
Molly was different. Quiet. She had this way of watching the world, like she was trying to understand it from a distance. Sometimes I‚Äôd catch her staring at me, her eyes wide and serious, and it would make me uncomfortable. I don‚Äôt think she ever fully understood what was going on with Mom and Dad. She was too young. But she felt it. I could see it in the way she clung to me, like I was the only thing that made sense in the chaos. I always felt responsible for her‚Äîlike if anything ever happened, it was on me to keep her safe.

I haven‚Äôt thought about them in a long time.

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôve been thinking about them now.

Maybe it‚Äôs because of what I found last week.

  I was going through some old boxes in my closet‚Äîstuff I hadn‚Äôt touched in years. Most of it was junk. Old clothes, tangled-up phone chargers, a few notebooks filled with half-scribbled ideas for stories I never finished. But at the bottom of one box, beneath a stack of old birthday cards and yellowed newspaper clippings, I found something that didn‚Äôt belong.

It was a photograph.

A picture of me and Noah.

  Noah was my best friend when I was a kid. We did everything together‚Äîrode bikes through the neighborhood, climbed trees in the woods behind my house, stayed up late telling scary stories in his basement.

And then, one summer, he was gone.

I was eight. He was nine.

  The picture must have been taken the day it happened. In it, we‚Äôre standing in front of an old, abandoned house at the edge of town. I remember that place. Everyone said it was haunted. Broken windows, rotting wood, a front door that hung open just enough to make you wonder what was inside.

Noah wanted to prove ghosts were real.

  He and I had always been adventurous‚Äîriding bikes through alleys, sneaking into abandoned buildings, climbing trees like we owned the damn forest‚Äîbut that day felt different. There was something in the air, thick and buzzing like electricity. We had packed a bag with snacks, flashlights, and a few bottles of water, though I don‚Äôt think we ever really planned on drinking them. It was more about the thrill of the unknown, the idea that we were doing something most kids our age were too scared to even think about.
We headed into the woods behind my house, the trees arching overhead like dark cathedral ceilings, shadows stretching long and deep as the sun began to dip lower. Noah was a few steps ahead, his usual grin plastered on his face.

‚ÄúHurry up, slowpoke,‚Äù he called, pushing aside a branch. ‚ÄúWhat, you scared already?‚Äù

‚ÄúPiss off,‚Äù I shot back, but I jogged to catch up.

 The trees pressed in around us, the branches scratching against each other like whispers. The ground felt weird under my feet, like it was shifting ever so slightly with every step. I shook it off. It was just nerves. We came to a clearing, and there it was‚Äîthe house. Old. Abandoned. The roof sagging, the windows black and empty like missing eyes.

Noah whistled. ‚ÄúDamn. It looks even creepier up close.‚Äù

I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have to go in.‚Äù

Noah turned to me, smirking. ‚ÄúYou kidding? This is what we came for. Thought you weren‚Äôt scared.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not.‚Äù

‚ÄúProve it.‚Äù

  He was already climbing the porch steps, and I had no choice but to follow. The wood groaned under our weight. He pressed his hand against the door, and with barely a push, it swung open with a long, aching creak. The air inside was thick, stale, carrying the scent of mildew and something else‚Äîsomething rotten.

‚ÄúSmells like ass in here,‚Äù Noah muttered, pulling his shirt up over his nose.

‚ÄúMaybe we shouldn‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúToo late,‚Äù he grinned, flicking on his flashlight.

  We moved deeper inside, our footsteps muffled by years of dust and neglect. The house was still, like it had been waiting for someone to disturb it. I ran my fingers along the peeling wallpaper, my skin crawling at the dampness beneath.

‚ÄúBet this place is full of ghosts,‚Äù Noah said, his voice teasing but quiet.

I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúYeah, sure. You believe in ghosts now?‚Äù

He grinned. ‚ÄúI do. But I wouldn‚Äôt need to. You‚Äôre scared enough for both of us.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am not!‚Äù I shouted, and Noah gave me the signal to hush

  He then just laughed and kept moving. Room by room, we explored‚Äîbroken furniture, old picture frames with faces too faded to make out, cabinets filled with dust and forgotten things. We found a rusted knife on the kitchen counter, its blade eaten away by time. Noah picked it up, turning it over in his hands.

‚ÄúMaybe it belonged to a murderer,‚Äù he said, waving it toward me.

‚ÄúJesus, put that down.‚Äù

He smirked, tossing it back onto the counter with a clatter. ‚ÄúRelax.‚Äù

Then we found the basement door. Noah grabbed the handle and jiggled it. Unlocked.

  He turned to me, his eyes glinting. ‚ÄúThis is where the real shit happens.‚Äù

I hesitated. The air was different here, heavier. My stomach twisted.

‚ÄúNoah, maybe we should‚Äî‚Äù

  But he was already yanking the door open. A wave of cold, damp air rushed up from below. The stairs stretched down into absolute blackness. Noah took the first step, flashlight beam bouncing along the walls. ‚ÄúYou coming, or what?‚Äù

  I swallowed hard and followed. Step by step, deeper into the dark. The smell was worse down here‚Äîthick, wet, like mold and rot and something else I couldn‚Äôt place. The air pressed against my skin, and I shivered.

‚ÄúNoah,‚Äù I whispered.

But he didn‚Äôt answer.

I swung my flashlight around.

He was gone.

Just‚Ä¶ gone.

And then‚Äî

Nothing.

I remember that much.

But as I stared at the photo, I realized something was wrong. 

I didn‚Äôt remember this picture being taken.

I don‚Äôt even remember bringing a camera that day.

And then, there was something else. In the background, behind us, there was a figure in one of the upstairs windows.

At first, I thought it was just a trick of the light‚Äîa shadow, a smudge, something explainable. But the longer I looked, the less sure I became. It was a person. A pale face, dark eyes, staring down at us.

I flipped the picture over. There was something written on the back, in faded ink. A date. July 15th, 2005.

The day Noah died.

I‚Äôve told myself that for years, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true.

The next thing I remember is running home, my arms scraped up, my shirt torn, my breath hitching in my chest. My mom grabbing my shoulders, shaking me, asking‚Äî""Where‚Äôs Noah? Where is he?!""

But I didn‚Äôt know.

I didn‚Äôt know.

The police found his body two days later, deep in the basement of that house.

A tragedy.

That‚Äôs what they called it.

But sometimes, late at night, I wonder. 

I dream about that house. About walking down those rotting stairs, the air thick and stale, the darkness pressing in. I dream about Noah‚Äôs face, pale and wide-eyed, his mouth open like he‚Äôs trying to scream.

And in my dreams, I‚Äôm standing over him.

Watching.

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm dreaming about it again. I haven‚Äôt thought about it for years. But it‚Äôs been getting worse, these last few nights. The dreams. The whispers.

It‚Äôs like I can feel something watching me when I wake up. The air is different somehow, thick with a presence I can‚Äôt explain. I check the apartment, even though I know it‚Äôs just me. I‚Äôve never been the type to jump at noises, but these days, even the smallest sound gets under my skin.

A tap at the window. The floor creaking in the hallway.

But it‚Äôs not just the noises. It‚Äôs the feeling.

It‚Äôs like something‚Äôs waiting for me to figure it out, like I‚Äôm on the verge of remembering something. And maybe that‚Äôs why I went digging in the first place. Maybe I wanted to find some kind of closure. Maybe I thought finding Noah‚Äôs picture would bring me peace.

Instead, it only brought more questions. 

I burned the photograph.

I don‚Äôt know why. Maybe I was scared of what it meant.

But it didn‚Äôt change anything.

Because last night, I woke up to something whispering my name.

And this time, I almost answered.",1,1738670873.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

In the chaotic universe of cryptocurrency, where Pepe coins cats and Dogecoin shibes bark for attention, a new memecoin has stormed onto the scene with a satirical edge: Thomas Douglas Homan (TDH). Inspired by the infamous ‚ÄúDEPORT master‚Äù and his no-nonsense reputation, this token isn‚Äôt just another joke‚Äîit‚Äôs a turbocharged meme machine for the crypto anarchist who loves dark humor, bureaucratic absurdity, and token burns that‚Äôd make weak hands tremble.

Who Is Thomas Douglas Homan?

Thomas Douglas Homan, the namesake of this gloriously unhinged token, is a real-life figure best known for his tough-on-immigration rhetoric as a former ICE official. But in the meme-ified crypto realm, $HOMAN reimagines him as a cartoonish anti-hero: a suit-wearing, coffee-chugging bureaucrat who ‚Äúgets things done‚Äù‚Ä¶ even if that means deporting weak-handed crypto traders to ‚ÄúFUD Island‚Äù while incinerating their tokens. The coin‚Äôs mascot‚Äîa stern-faced caricature holding a ‚ÄúDEPORT‚Äù stamp in one hand and a ‚ÄúTo the Moon!‚Äù rocket in the other‚Äîperfectly captures its mission: mixing political satire with crypto‚Äôs lawless spirit.


Origins: Born from a Twitter Troll Army

Rumor has it $HOMAN was conceived during a 3 a.m. Twitter feud between crypto degens and politics junkies. Someone joked, ‚ÄúWhat if we made a token for the guy who deports Shiba Inu to the pound?‚Äù The name ‚ÄúThomas Douglas Homan‚Äù trended instantly, and within hours, a unique deployer and token contract‚Äîprogrammed to include ruthless anti-rug mechanics‚Äîdropped alongside a website featuring Homan‚Äôs face Photoshopped onto Mount Rushmore. The rest is meme history.

The ‚ÄúDEPORT Weak Hands‚Äù Mechanism
TDH‚Äôs developers added a ruthless twist: sell your tokens too early, and your wallet gets hit with a ‚ÄúDEPORT‚Äù notice‚Äîa meme-filled PDF of Homan lecturing you about ‚Äúdiamond hands‚Äù while your remaining tokens are burned into oblivion. Track these fiery purges in real-time on www . homan  fun, where a live deportation tracker updates like a dystopian scoreboard. It‚Äôs the crypto equivalent of getting sent to meme jail‚Ä¶ with a side of deflationary tokenomics.


Built to Last: Tokenomics & Security

Unique Tokenomics: No lazy copy-paste here. The deployer and contract are custom-coded, featuring a burn mechanism that activates during deportations and a supply crunch designed to reward HODLers.

Locked & Burned Liquidity: LP tokens are sealed in a digital Alcatraz (and later burned), ensuring no shady exits.

Thomas Douglas Homan, the namesake of this gloriously unhinged token, is a real-life figure best known for his tough-on-immigration rhetoric as a former ICE official. But in the meme-ified crypto realm, $HOMAN reimagines him as a cartoonish anti-hero: a suit-wearing, coffee-chugging bureaucrat who ‚Äúgets things done‚Äù‚Ä¶ even if that means deporting weak-handed crypto traders to ‚ÄúFUD Island‚Äù while incinerating their tokens. The coin‚Äôs mascot‚Äîa stern-faced caricature holding a ‚ÄúDEPORT‚Äù stamp in one hand and a ‚ÄúTo the Moon!‚Äù rocket in the other‚Äîperfectly captures its mission: mixing political satire with crypto‚Äôs lawless spirit.


Origins: Born from a Twitter Troll Army

Rumor has it $HOMAN was conceived during a 3 a.m. Twitter feud between crypto degens and politics junkies. Someone joked, ‚ÄúWhat if we made a token for the guy who deports Shiba Inu to the pound?‚Äù The name ‚ÄúThomas Douglas Homan‚Äù trended instantly, and within hours, a unique deployer and token contract‚Äîprogrammed to include ruthless anti-rug mechanics‚Äîdropped alongside a website featuring Homan‚Äôs face Photoshopped onto Mount Rushmore. The rest is meme history.

The ‚ÄúDEPORT Weak Hands‚Äù Mechanism
TDH‚Äôs developers added a ruthless twist: sell your tokens too early, and your wallet gets hit with a ‚ÄúDEPORT‚Äù notice‚Äîa meme-filled PDF of Homan lecturing you about ‚Äúdiamond hands‚Äù while your remaining tokens are burned into oblivion. Track these fiery purges in real-time on www . homan  fun, where a live deportation tracker updates like a dystopian scoreboard. It‚Äôs the crypto equivalent of getting sent to meme jail‚Ä¶ with a side of deflationary tokenomics.


Built to Last: Tokenomics & Security

Unique Tokenomics: No lazy copy-paste here. The deployer and contract are custom-coded, featuring a burn mechanism that activates during deportations and a supply crunch designed to reward HODLers.

Locked & Burned Liquidity: LP tokens are sealed in a digital Alcatraz (and later burned), ensuring no shady exits.

Team Transparency: The 8-person squad (including 3 devs) holds <5% of tokens‚Äîno secret dumps. Marketing/KOL wallets? Also zero sell pressure, because ‚Äúdeporting bags‚Äù isn‚Äôt their style.


Meme Campaigns That Border on Chaos

The community hosts weekly contests like ‚ÄúDesign Homan‚Äôs Next Executive Order‚Äù (winners include ‚ÄúBan Paper Hands from the Moon Mission‚Äù and ‚ÄúBuild the Wall Street Bets‚Äù).

How to Join the Deportation Party
Already dubbed the ‚Äú#1 HOMAN Token‚Äù by its unhinged community, the project boasts a lean $110,000 FDV‚Äîsmall enough to moon, big enough to crush weak narratives. Buy the dip, dodge the deportation stamp, and meme your way to the asylum.

TDH‚Äôs developers added a ruthless twist: sell your tokens too early, and your wallet gets hit with a ‚ÄúDEPORT‚Äù notice‚Äîa meme-filled PDF of Homan lecturing you about ‚Äúdiamond hands‚Äù while your remaining tokens are burned into oblivion. Track these fiery purges in real-time on www . homan  fun, where a live deportation tracker updates like a dystopian scoreboard. It‚Äôs the crypto equivalent of getting sent to meme jail‚Ä¶ with a side of deflationary tokenomics.

Unique Tokenomics: No lazy copy-paste here. The deployer and contract are custom-coded, featuring a burn mechanism that activates during deportations and a supply crunch designed to reward HODLers.

Locked & Burned Liquidity: LP tokens are sealed in a digital Alcatraz (and later burned), ensuring no shady exits.

Team Transparency: The 8-person squad (including 3 devs) holds <5% of tokens‚Äîno secret dumps. Marketing/KOL wallets? Also zero sell pressure, because ‚Äúdeporting bags‚Äù isn‚Äôt their style.

How to Join the Deportation Party
Already dubbed the ‚Äú#1 HOMAN Token‚Äù by its unhinged community, the project boasts a lean $110,000 FDV‚Äîsmall enough to moon, big enough to crush weak narratives. Buy the dip, dodge the deportation stamp, and meme your way to the asylum.

In the chaotic universe of cryptocurrency, where Pepe coins cats and Dogecoin shibes bark for attention, a new memecoin has stormed onto the scene with a satirical edge: Thomas Douglas Homan (TDH).

In the chaotic universe of cryptocurrency, where Pepe coins cats and Dogecoin shibes bark for attention, a new memecoin has stormed onto the scene with a satirical edge: Thomas Douglas Homan (TDH). Inspired by the infamous ‚ÄúDEPORT master‚Äù and his no-nonsense reputation, this token isn‚Äôt just another joke‚Äîit‚Äôs a turbocharged meme machine for the crypto anarchist who loves dark humor, bureaucratic absurdity, and token burns that‚Äôd make weak hands tremble.

Who Is Thomas Douglas Homan?

Thomas Douglas Homan, the namesake of this gloriously unhinged token, is a real-life figure best known for his tough-on-immigration rhetoric as a former ICE official. But in the meme-ified crypto realm, $HOMAN reimagines him as a cartoonish anti-hero: a suit-wearing, coffee-chugging bureaucrat who ‚Äúgets things done‚Äù‚Ä¶ even if that means deporting weak-handed crypto traders to ‚ÄúFUD Island‚Äù while incinerating their tokens. The coin‚Äôs mascot‚Äîa stern-faced caricature holding a ‚ÄúDEPORT‚Äù stamp in one hand and a ‚ÄúTo the Moon!‚Äù rocket in the other‚Äîperfectly captures its mission: mixing political satire with crypto‚Äôs lawless spirit.


Origins: Born from a Twitter Troll Army

Rumor has it $HOMAN was conceived during a 3 a.m. Twitter feud between crypto degens and politics junkies. Someone joked, ‚ÄúWhat if we made a token for the guy who deports Shiba Inu to the pound?‚Äù The name ‚ÄúThomas Douglas Homan‚Äù trended instantly, and within hours, a unique deployer and token contract‚Äîprogrammed to include ruthless anti-rug mechanics‚Äîdropped alongside a website featuring Homan‚Äôs face Photoshopped onto Mount Rushmore. The rest is meme history.


Why $HOMAN Isn‚Äôt Just Another Shitcoin

The ‚ÄúDEPORT Weak Hands‚Äù Mechanism
TDH‚Äôs developers added a ruthless twist: sell your tokens too early, and your wallet gets hit with a ‚ÄúDEPORT‚Äù notice‚Äîa meme-filled PDF of Homan lecturing you about ‚Äúdiamond hands‚Äù while your remaining tokens are burned into oblivion. Track these fiery purges in real-time on www . homan  fun, where a live deportation tracker updates like a dystopian scoreboard. It‚Äôs the crypto equivalent of getting sent to meme jail‚Ä¶ with a side of deflationary tokenomics.


Built to Last: Tokenomics & Security

Unique Tokenomics: No lazy copy-paste here. The deployer and contract are custom-coded, featuring a burn mechanism that activates during deportations and a supply crunch designed to reward HODLers.

Locked & Burned Liquidity: LP tokens are sealed in a digital Alcatraz (and later burned), ensuring no shady exits.

Team Transparency: The 8-person squad (including 3 devs) holds <5% of tokens‚Äîno secret dumps. Marketing/KOL wallets? Also zero sell pressure, because ‚Äúdeporting bags‚Äù isn‚Äôt their style.

In the chaotic universe of cryptocurrency, where Pepe coins cats and Dogecoin shibes bark for attention, a new memecoin has stormed onto the scene with a satirical edge: Thomas Douglas Homan (TDH). Inspired by the infamous ‚ÄúDEPORT master‚Äù and his no-nonsense reputation, this token isn‚Äôt just another joke‚Äîit‚Äôs a turbocharged meme machine for the crypto anarchist who loves dark humor, bureaucratic absurdity, and token burns that‚Äôd make weak hands tremble.

Who Is Thomas Douglas Homan?

Thomas Douglas Homan, the namesake of this gloriously unhinged token, is a real-life figure best known for his tough-on-immigration rhetoric as a former ICE official. But in the meme-ified crypto realm, $HOMAN reimagines him as a cartoonish anti-hero: a suit-wearing, coffee-chugging bureaucrat who ‚Äúgets things done‚Äù‚Ä¶ even if that means deporting weak-handed crypto traders to ‚ÄúFUD Island‚Äù while incinerating their tokens. The coin‚Äôs mascot‚Äîa stern-faced caricature holding a ‚ÄúDEPORT‚Äù stamp in one hand and a ‚ÄúTo the Moon!‚Äù rocket in the other‚Äîperfectly captures its mission: mixing political satire with crypto‚Äôs lawless spirit.


Origins: Born from a Twitter Troll Army

Rumor has it $HOMAN was conceived during a 3 a.m. Twitter feud between crypto degens and politics junkies. Someone joked, ‚ÄúWhat if we made a token for the guy who deports Shiba Inu to the pound?‚Äù The name ‚ÄúThomas Douglas Homan‚Äù trended instantly, and within hours, a unique deployer and token contract‚Äîprogrammed to include ruthless anti-rug mechanics‚Äîdropped alongside a website featuring Homan‚Äôs face Photoshopped onto Mount Rushmore. The rest is meme history.


Why $HOMAN Isn‚Äôt Just Another Shitcoin

The ‚ÄúDEPORT Weak Hands‚Äù Mechanism
TDH‚Äôs developers added a ruthless twist: sell your tokens too early, and your wallet gets hit with a ‚ÄúDEPORT‚Äù notice‚Äîa meme-filled PDF of Homan lecturing you about ‚Äúdiamond hands‚Äù while your remaining tokens are burned into oblivion. Track these fiery purges in real-time on www . homan  fun, where a live deportation tracker updates like a dystopian scoreboard. It‚Äôs the crypto equivalent of getting sent to meme jail‚Ä¶ with a side of deflationary tokenomics.


Built to Last: Tokenomics & Security

Unique Tokenomics: No lazy copy-paste here. The deployer and contract are custom-coded, featuring a burn mechanism that activates during deportations and a supply crunch designed to reward HODLers.

Locked & Burned Liquidity: LP tokens are sealed in a digital Alcatraz (and later burned), ensuring no shady exits.

Team Transparency: The 8-person squad (including 3 devs) holds <5% of tokens‚Äîno secret dumps. Marketing/KOL wallets? Also zero sell pressure, because ‚Äúdeporting bags‚Äù isn‚Äôt their style.


Meme Campaigns That Border on Chaos

The community hosts weekly contests like ‚ÄúDesign Homan‚Äôs Next Executive Order‚Äù (winners include ‚ÄúBan Paper Hands from the Moon Mission‚Äù and ‚ÄúBuild the Wall Street Bets‚Äù). Meanwhile, new features are en route‚Äîthink Homan-themed NFTs and a ‚ÄúDEPORT Roulette‚Äù game. Partnerships? They‚Äôre coming. $HOMAN ain‚Äôt solo-dolo for long.

How to Join the Deportation Party
Already dubbed the ‚Äú#1 HOMAN Token‚Äù by its unhinged community, the project boasts a lean $110,000 FDV‚Äîsmall enough to moon, big enough to crush weak narratives. Buy the dip, dodge the deportation stamp, and meme your way to the asylum.

1ihg27e,https://v.redd.it/grbtzkjv34he1,Santorini Greece üá¨üá∑ Earthquakes update,"SANTORINI, Greece -- More Greek islands closed schools Tuesday as hundreds of earthquakes ratted the Aegean Sea, while a handful of hardy tourists enjoyed having Santorini‚Äôs stunning views to themselves.

Thousands of residents and seasonal workers have left the Cycladic Islands as hundreds of quakes up to magnitude 5 were recorded in the volcanic region since Friday. Ferry and commercial flight operators added services to accommodate departures.

The quakes have caused cracks in some older building but no injuries have been reported so far. On Tuesday, schools were shut on 13 islands, up from four the previous day. Santorini earlier canceled public events, restricted travel to the island and banned construction work in certain areas.

Efthimios Lekkas, head of the state-run Earthquake Planning and Protection Organization, said the epicenter of earthquakes in the Aegean Sea was moving northward away from Santorini, emphasizing that there was no connection to the area's dormant volcanoes.

‚ÄúThis may last several days or several weeks. We are not able to predict the evolution of the sequence in time,‚Äù Lekkas told state-run television.

In Santorini‚Äôs main town, Fira, the narrow, whitewashed streets along the island‚Äôs clifftops were deserted ‚Äî a rare sight even in the off season ‚Äî except for small pockets of tour groups, many from Asian countries.

Joseph Liu, from Guangzhou in southern China, said he had wanted to visit Santorini for years after seeing it in a documentary. He joined family and tour group members on a balcony deck typically used for high-end wedding receptions.

‚ÄúThis place is amazing, really beautiful. Just like I saw in the program: the mystery, the scenery,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe (group) leader told us about the earthquakes before we came so it was not a surprise.‚Äù

Retired police officer and ship worker Panagiotis Hatzigeorgiou, who has lived on Santorini for more than 30 years, said he has turned down offers to stay with relatives in Athens.

‚ÄúOlder residents are used to the earthquakes ... But it‚Äôs different this time. It‚Äôs not the same to have earthquakes every 2-3 minutes. The main thing is not to worry,‚Äù he said, adding with a laugh: ‚ÄúNow we can listen to music alone and have coffee by ourselves.‚Äù

In Athens, government officials are continuing to hold daily high-level planning and assessment meetings with briefings from island officials. As reported by ABC News abcnews.go.com/Technology/wir‚Ä¶",1,1738670440.0,u_youandI123777,0,1.0,False

A HENRY's guide to HENRY!","For a bit of fun, I ask you the question; - If you had to offer someone in your network some honest advice about what career path they should follow in order to increase the likelihood that they achieve HENRY status, what would you say? Please feel free to be as broad or as specific as you would like, but stay relevant to the 'income earning' part of the problem, not so much what you do with the money you earn to build wealth.

It's just a bit of fun. I would be interested to hear comments and compare to what was being thrown around over coffee this morning. It might also be interesting to know your rough background and see if there are any trends that pop up off the back of certain careers or sectors of industry etc. For example, an EA for a senior staff member said he would do a trade apprenticeship and secure an AI proof role where he could hopefully grow a successful business which would yield him HENRY. Fair point I thought.

  
Context: This was sparked after a conversation with a colleague this morning who had a family friend in for a bit of shadowing who was struggling with career progression in current role and curious about jobs/industries that can lead to HENRY. Person in example was late 20's and happy to retrain/study in order to get there in say, 10-15yrs time. But the question remains the same for anyone in your network who you would like to see succeed if they came to you for advice, regardless of age. Let's ignore any major barriers to entry, or rather, flag them as a caveat if they are in your suggestion.

1ihfyle,https://i.redd.it/1a0i5lor24he1.jpeg,Why Is Critical Thinking Key to Thriving in Tomorrow's Economy?,"Mastering the Art of Independent Thought in the Age of AI and Automation

Introduction
As the global economy undergoes rapid transformation, driven by artificial intelligence (AI), automation, and constant technological innovation, one skill stands out as indispensable: critical thinking.

Unlike technical skills that may become outdated or automated, critical thinking equips you with the ability to adapt, problem-solve, and innovate‚Äîqualities that machines simply can‚Äôt replicate. In the near future, AI will write code, analyze data, and even generate art, but it still won‚Äôt be able to question its own assumptions, challenge biases, or create entirely new paradigms of thought.

In this blog, we‚Äôll explore why critical thinking is the foundation of success in tomorrow‚Äôs economy and, more importantly, how you can strengthen this invaluable skill before your robot coworkers start demanding coffee breaks.

What Is Critical Thinking?
Critical thinking is the ability to evaluate information objectively, analyze evidence, and make reasoned decisions. It‚Äôs not about what you know‚Äîit‚Äôs about how you think. A critical thinker questions assumptions, considers multiple perspectives, and avoids jumping to conclusions.

Think of critical thinking as the brain‚Äôs Swiss Army knife‚Äîa versatile tool that allows you to navigate complexity, solve problems creatively, and discern truth in an age of information overload. AI can process terabytes of data, but only a human mind can interpret nuance, challenge the status quo, and think beyond the immediate outputs.

Why Critical Thinking Is Essential for the Future Economy
1. Automation Can‚Äôt Replace Critical Thought
While machines excel at repetitive and data-driven tasks, they fall short when it comes to abstract reasoning, ethical decision-making, and creative problem-solving.

For example:

AI can diagnose diseases, but it can‚Äôt understand the emotional nuances of patient care.
Robots can perform highly complex calculations, but designing, innovating, and thinking outside the box remain uniquely human abilities.

Critical thinking ensures that you can adapt to technological changes and work with automation‚Äînot be replaced by it.

2. Navigating the Era of Information Overload
In a digital-first world, we‚Äôre bombarded with vast amounts of information every second. Separating fact from fiction‚Äîor relevance from noise‚Äîrequires discernment.

Critical thinkers ask:
‚úÖ Where is this information coming from? Is it credible?
‚úÖ Are there biases influencing how this is presented?
‚úÖ What‚Äôs missing from this narrative?

In the future economy, being able to evaluate information quickly and accurately will give you a competitive edge. AI can summarize the news, but only a human mind can determine whether it actually matters.

3. Adaptability Is a Non-Negotiable Skill
Entire industries are being disrupted at an unprecedented rate. The skills in demand today may be obsolete tomorrow. Critical thinking enables you to:

üîπ Spot trends before they become obvious.
üîπ Pivot strategies when old approaches stop working.
üîπ Innovate solutions for unexpected challenges.

The future belongs to those who can adapt‚Äîand adaptability is rooted in critical thinking. If you can‚Äôt think critically, you might find yourself struggling to keep up with an AI that learned your job overnight.

4. Collaboration Demands Empathy and Reason
The rise of hybrid teams, remote work, and cross-disciplinary projects means that collaboration is more important than ever. Critical thinking fosters:

üí° Better communication by encouraging thoughtful questions and active listening.
üí° Conflict resolution by identifying shared goals and exploring creative compromises.

AI might streamline workflows, but it can‚Äôt navigate the human complexities of collaboration. That‚Äôs where critical thinking shines.

How to Build Your Critical Thinking Skills
Like any muscle, critical thinking strengthens with practice. Here‚Äôs how to get started:

1. Ask Better Questions
Good critical thinkers know that the right question can unlock better answers.

For example:
üöÄ Instead of asking, ""What‚Äôs the solution?"" ask, ""What‚Äôs causing this problem?""
üöÄ Instead of asking, ""Who‚Äôs at fault?"" ask, ""What can we learn from this?""

(Pro tip: Improve your question-asking skills with Question-a-Day!)

2. Challenge Your Assumptions
Recognizing your own biases and blind spots is key to critical thinking. Ask yourself:

üîç Am I basing this decision on facts or assumptions?
üîç How might someone with a different perspective view this situation?

The ability to examine and refine your thought process is the hallmark of a true critical thinker.

3. Learn to Spot Logical Fallacies
Train yourself to recognize flawed reasoning in arguments. Common fallacies include:

‚ö†Ô∏è Strawman arguments ‚Äì Misrepresenting an opposing view to make it easier to attack.
‚ö†Ô∏è Ad hominem attacks ‚Äì Criticizing the person rather than addressing the argument.
‚ö†Ô∏è False dichotomies ‚Äì Presenting two options as the only possibilities when others exist.

Understanding logical fallacies helps you evaluate arguments with clarity and precision.

4. Engage in Diverse Learning
Expose yourself to a wide range of ideas, disciplines, and cultures. Read books, attend workshops, or take online courses that challenge your current understanding. The broader your knowledge base, the better you‚Äôll be at connecting dots and thinking critically.

üí° Pro tip: If you only consume content that confirms what you already believe, you‚Äôre not thinking‚Äîyou‚Äôre reinforcing.

Why Critical Thinking Is Your Best Investment for the Future
Critical thinking isn‚Äôt just a skill; it‚Äôs a superpower in the making. As industries evolve, automation advances, and the sheer volume of information grows, critical thinkers will be the ones who thrive. They‚Äôll innovate, lead, and collaborate in ways that machines simply cannot replicate.

The future belongs to those who can think independently, adapt to change, and create value where others see obstacles.

So, are you ready to sharpen your thinking and thrive in tomorrow‚Äôs economy?

I have tried dating apps, starting conversations while waiting in line for coffee, and developing relationships through my friends' acquaintances, but none of it worked.

4. Leave gaps in the ring of your coffee stain where you marked your letters.
5. Draw droplets near the gap. One drop for the first letter, two drops for the second letter and so on.

I had too much fun with this, so here‚Äôs my (probably controversial) take. üòÑ

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Uttar Pradesh = Ohio

* **Why?** Both are political powerhouses. UP decides who rules Delhi, and Ohio is the ultimate swing state in US elections. Rich in history but often stereotyped as ‚Äúchaotic.‚Äù
* **Stereotype Match:** *‚ÄúIf politics were a sport, they‚Äôd both be in the finals every time.‚Äù*

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Punjab = Texas

* **Why?** Big personalities, bold food, loud pride, and a love for agriculture‚Äîand don‚Äôt forget the obsession with trucks. *‚ÄúGo big or go home‚Äù* applies to both.
* **Bonus:** Cowboys = Sardars (kind of).

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Kerala = California

* **Why?** Progressive, coastal, stunning landscapes, and filled with people who love to debate politics over coffee (or toddy). Plus, both love their movies‚ÄîMollywood and Hollywood.

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Rajasthan = Arizona

* **Why?** Desert landscapes, majestic forts, and extreme temperatures. Both are tourist magnets with ancient history baked into their sands.

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Bihar = West Virginia

* **Why?** Stereotyped heavily but rich in history and culture. Strong working-class roots, underestimated by outsiders, and fiercely proud locals.

# 6Ô∏è‚É£ Maharashtra = New York

* **Why?** Mumbai = NYC. The financial capital, the city that never sleeps, with a melting pot of cultures. Both are where dreams are made‚Ä¶ and broken.

# 7Ô∏è‚É£ Gujarat = Florida

* **Why?** Business-friendly, entrepreneurial, with vibrant festivals and slightly quirky reputations. Also, both states LOVE their ‚Äúspecial snacks.‚Äù üòè

# 8Ô∏è‚É£ Tamil Nadu = Massachusetts

* **Why?** Intellectual hubs with prestigious universities (IIT Madras & MIT, anyone?). Rich in cultural heritage, strong accents, and historic significance.

# 9Ô∏è‚É£ West Bengal = Illinois (Chicago)

* **Why?** The cultural capital meets the windy city. Strong literary and artistic vibes, revolutionary histories, and passionate about food. (Rosogolla vs. Deep Dish Pizza‚Äîfight me.)

# üîü Himachal Pradesh = Colorado

* **Why?** Mountains, snow, scenic beauty, and chill vibes‚Äîliterally and figuratively. Perfect for nature lovers and adventure junkies.

# üöÄ Discussion Time:

* Which ones do you agree with?
* Which comparisons made you go, *‚ÄúWait, what?!‚Äù*
* Got better state match-ups? I‚Äôd love to hear your takes!

I 100% agree that Andy getting into Facebook groups centered around people/children with autism and then focusing primarily on speaking about random autistic children with their parents is extremely odd behavior. BUT...does anyone REALLY think that going to these groups, randomly announcing that Andy is a menace, and then expecting people to rush to YouTube to start verifying claims from complete strangers is *actually* going to accomplish anything? Let's be real here.

No, instead...I think the time has come to start compiling Andy's greatest hits. Common knowledge for squatch watchers, deep cuts, random accusations concerning Andy, footage he has uploaded himself...it would be much better for newcomers and any concerned people to have one primary resource they can use to locate whatever info they need to find pertaining to Andy - especially considering the web of lies and demented behavior that surrounds him.

hi everyone! im still a new gerbil owner, so i would love some feedback here. i have two male gerbils, id say theyre still young. my (i think) dominant gerbil, Coffee has always been biting the bars. at first i thought it was because of little burrow space (their first tank was temporary&too small) so i upgraded their cage to have 30cm burrow space. and while they do love making tunnels, one of them still bites on the bars obsessively, to the point that he is losing hair on his nose. i try giving him chews, it keeps him entertained for a few second, then hes back at it. they have a wheel, a few hides, always clean sandbath (i clean it even two times a day) and they get two tablespoons of food a day + hand given snacks (only a few to not overfeed). i really dont know what to do about it. i dont want him to bite the bars as its loud and i think its harmful for him too :( i later on thought this behavior couldve been due to wanting outside time, but everytime i take him out and put him back later he is yet again back at it. i have tried making arrangements in the cage to keep him interested, didnt work. also the other gerbil doesnt show signs of this behavior, as he only bites on the bars in the morning when its feeding time, no bar biting once fed. please help me, what else can i do to help him?",6,1738669292.0,gerbil,6,1.0,False

It began September 2023, so it has been ongoing for a year and a half. This first began, when I was on my way home from work and on a 20-minute tube ride and I had to get off to urinate three times and I felt like I couldn‚Äôt hold it in at all. This led to me having an almost panic attack on the train home, because of how bad it felt. That weekend I felt fine and told some mates about how strange the experience was. Then Monday came around and I went back to work and on my way home the same thing happened again, and it took me over 2 hours to get home due to how many toilet breaks I needed. I think this situation led to me never being able to relax and my body almost finding it slightly traumatic, so now I cannot relax what I presume is my pelvic floor and I‚Äôm constantly tensing as if I am holding in a piss. 

I once left an hour-long meeting at work 5 times to urinate, it is completely making me distracted at work.

I have been to the doctors‚Äô multiple times to try and figure out what is wrong with me. In which I have done five urine samples, these all came through fine in terms of glucose and infections, however there were traces of blood and proteins in each sample. Due to this I managed to get sent for an ultrasound on my kidneys, urethra, and bladder this all came back fine I was told my bladder could hold about 400ml of liquid. After this I was sent for a blood test to test certain levels of something, but I was told it all came back fine. I have also done STD tests, which came back clear.

I went on month long prescription of oxybutynin hydrochloride, however this did absolutely nothing. I have now not been in contact with the doctors for over 10 months as I begun to think I could maybe live with it. But that is not possible, and I am now seriously at a point where I don‚Äôt know how much I can go on living like this. 

I live in London with friends all over the city, so I find myself to be on trains quite often, but it is a completely insufferable experience as I cannot sit still at all so I usually stand up, I ¬†quite often must get off the train to urinate or work my life around getting trains with toilets or taking routes where I pass a toilet. I can‚Äôt even read on the train or bus as I am constantly bombarded by the sensation of needing to wee.

I also find I have this almost tick like thing where I feel like I must squeeze the tip of my penis (through my jeans is fine, I don‚Äôt literally get it out lol) otherwise it feels like I am going to wet myself. That obviously makes me look like a complete freak in public, usually I can do it behind my jacket or something so it‚Äôs not obvious whatsoever but in summer where I had no jacket, I definitely had some moments getting strange looks due to this. 
But I am now at a point of desperation, as I cannot go on like this it is completely ruining my life. I am looking for anything that can be done. I started the pelvic floor exercises for men this week, but otherwise I have no idea what else I can do, and I really need help. I also have cut out caffeine countless times but it doesn‚Äôt help, and I don‚Äôt drink coffee at all anymore.

So, if you have any experiences with fixing this or at least making it bearable please let me know.

MIL got sick so couldn‚Äôt come to help me. Ugh. I somehow got through the past 3 days. 

I woke up around 430 and couldn‚Äôt get back to sleep. I went downstairs around 5:15 to get a snack and maybe some coffee. I was as quiet as possible and didn‚Äôt even turn on any lights but of course my 2.5 yo girl got up. I grabbed some grapes and milk.  I went to grab my uncrustable from the pull out freezer ‚Ä¶. And she saw the ice cream cones. She had a meltdown at 5:30am. I was steadfast and she eventually calmed down. As I was changing her diaper she told me she loved me. Then she wants to try to go potty. She sits on her potty, nothing happening and after a few minutes I tell her let‚Äôs try again later. Cue another meltdown. It‚Äôs not even 6am. My uncrustable hasn‚Äôt even thawed yet. I‚Äôm tired. 

All I wanted was to eat this uncrustable (raspberry flavor it‚Äôs sooo good!) with a cup of coffee. Instead I feel like I‚Äôm getting bullied by my 2 year old.

When you develop self-love, you're essentially nurturing a healthy relationship with yourself, which then ripples outward, influencing how you treat others and how others perceive you.

In recent years, self-love has become so clich√©d that it has, at best, been reduced to a marketing word or gimmick and, at worst, to woo-woo drivel. People who believe self-love is selfish or just another word for self-indulgence are typically the ones who respond negatively. Then, some individuals believe that in order to love yourself, you must be a certain way.

But none of those extreme positions are true. Self-centeredness or selfishness is not implied by self-love. Furthermore, feeling ""worthy"" of love shouldn't be equated with liking oneself. A deep love for oneself is something you deserve.

*My mission, should I choose to accept it, is to find peace with exactly who and what I am. To take pride in my thoughts, my appearance, my talents, my flaws and to stop this incessant worrying that I can‚Äôt be loved as I am. \~Anais Nin*

Love For Oneself: What Is It?

I would be the first to admit that it took me some time to realize that self-love is more than just using it as an excuse for self-indulgence.

When I was younger, I thought excessive soda consumption, overindulging in junk food, and reckless purchasing were all acceptable ways to show one's love for oneself. I liked to shop, eat junk food, and drink soda, so I thought that doing more of these things must mean I was really enjoying myself. Today's me knows all of those things were really an effort to avoid facing my childhood trauma, and they eventually did more harm than good.

It took a lot of introspection and mental retraining for me to see self-love as something more than the ""indulging myself"" mindset.

Self-love to me is embracing and caring for oneself. It's about being nice, kind, and respectful to yourself because you deserve it. Loving who you are is one of the most powerful things you can do for yourself. Instead of being a destination, self-love is a constant journey of healing.

Self-love is ultimately about learning to embrace who you are completely, acting kindly to be the greatest version of yourself, and finding your path to happiness and serenity with self-compassion.

*The most terrifying thing is to accept oneself completely. \~ C.G. Jung*

# How Trauma Affects Loving Oneself

Self-love and trauma are deeply intertwined, and it‚Äôs important to understand that healing from trauma while fostering self-love can be a delicate process. Trauma, whether from past abuse, neglect, loss, or any other deeply painful experience, can leave lasting emotional wounds that impact how you view yourself and the world. Developing self-love after trauma is not only possible but essential for healing.

Trauma often creates self-blame, guilt, or feelings of worthlessness. It can distort how you see yourself. Developing self-love allows for self-compassion, which means understanding that your pain is valid and that you deserve care, healing, and support. Compassion for yourself helps counteract the negative beliefs trauma may have left behind, like thinking you're unworthy or broken.

Trauma can leave a sense of distrust, both in others and in you. Learning to love yourself means giving yourself permission to trust again‚Äînot just others, but also your ability to cope, to set healthy boundaries, and to make decisions that serve your well-being. Building this trust in yourself is a crucial part of reclaiming your power.

Trauma can create a sense of chaos and unease, and it may feel you‚Äôre never fully safe, even within yourself. Self-love helps you create a sense of safety and peace internally. Practices like mindfulness, meditation, or journaling can help you reconnect with your body, your emotions, and your sense of self, which aids in emotional regulation and healing.

How you love yourself is how you teach others to love you. \~ Rupi Kaur

# What Makes Self-Love Essential?

Self-love influences virtually every aspect of your life‚Äîmentally, emotionally, and even physically. Here are a few key reasons it‚Äôs such a foundational part of well-being:

1. **Mental Health and Emotional Resilience:** When you love yourself, you're more equipped to handle life's challenges. You develop better emotional resilience because you're kinder to yourself when things go wrong. Self-love helps reduce anxiety, depression, and negative self-talk by fostering self-compassion instead of self-criticism.

Mental well-being and physical health are deeply connected. When you prioritize self-love, you're more likely to take care of your body, get enough rest, eat healthily, and engage in activities that nourish you. It‚Äôs not about perfection, but about recognizing the importance of nurturing yourself holistically.

1. **Healthy Boundaries:** After trauma, it's hard to establish and maintain boundaries, especially if you've been in situations where your boundaries were violated. Self-love empowers you to set boundaries that protect your emotional and physical well-being. You begin to recognize that it‚Äôs okay to say no, to prioritize yourself, and to walk away from situations or people that don‚Äôt honor your worth.¬† Loving yourself means you understand your worth and what you deserve in relationships and situations. This helps you set boundaries that protect your time, energy, and mental space, leading to healthier interactions with others. Without self-love, you might tolerate behavior or situations that drain or harm you.

The more you love yourself, the more you‚Äôre able to offer love, compassion, and support to others. Healthy self-love leads to healthier relationships because it encourages respect, understanding, and a sense of equality. You‚Äôre more likely to attract and maintain relationships that are uplifting and balanced.

1. **Self-Worth and Confidence:** If you don't love yourself, it's easy to fall into self-doubt or seek validation from others. But when you love yourself, you have an internal source of confidence and validation. This helps you pursue your goals, take risks, and live authentically, without relying too heavily on external approval. Traumatic experiences can make you feel powerless, but self-love helps you reconnect with your inner strength. It‚Äôs about recognizing that you‚Äôve survived, that you are resilient, and that your ability to heal is a powerful testament to your strength. Embrace this strength as part of your self-love journey.

Self-love gives you the permission to explore, grow, and pursue what brings you joy and purpose. It supports you in taking steps toward your dreams and goals, free from the fear of failure or judgment. Loving yourself means you're willing to invest in your potential, knowing you deserve success and happiness.

1. **Breaking Negative Cycles:** Many of us carry patterns from past experiences, like trauma, failure, or unhealed wounds. Self-love helps break these cycles by healing those old scars, forgiving yourself, and moving forward with a new, healthier mindset. It creates space for change, transformation, and growth.

Self-love is truly the bedrock of a fulfilling life. Without it, it‚Äôs hard to be truly happy or content, as you‚Äôll always be relying on external sources for validation and happiness. It‚Äôs essential for self-empowerment, well-being, and living authentically.

I now see how owning our story and loving ourselves through that process is the bravest thing that we will ever do. \~ Bren√© Brown

# Confusion Understanding Self-Love

Self-love can sometimes get confused with things that aren‚Äôt truly rooted in a healthy sense of self-worth.

1. Loving yourself doesn't mean putting your needs above everyone else that harms or neglects others. It's about finding balance, recognizing your worth, and respecting others' needs, too.
2. Treating yourself with kindness doesn‚Äôt mean giving in to every impulse or desire. True self-love means being kind to yourself in a way that promotes long-term well-being and growth, not just short-term pleasure.
3. Self-love isn‚Äôt about being perfect or constantly striving for flawlessness. It's about accepting yourself as you are‚Äîflaws and imperfections. Embracing those imperfections is part of the journey of self-love.
4. Loving yourself doesn‚Äôt mean being complacent or avoiding self-improvement. True self-love involves being aware of areas where you can grow and being willing to do the work to become a better version of yourself.
5. Self-love isn‚Äôt about making excuses for your actions or avoiding responsibility. It means acknowledging your mistakes, learning from them, and making amends when necessary, while being compassionate with yourself during the process.
6. Self-love doesn‚Äôt mean you always feel amazing. It involves accepting your emotions, even the tough ones, and knowing how to care for yourself through both the highs and the lows.

Self-love is creating a relationship with yourself where you nurture your well-being, growth, and happiness without falling into unhealthy patterns of avoidance, self-centeredness, or unrealistic expectations. It‚Äôs being kind, accepting, and supportive of who you are, flaws and all.

This self-love is the instrument of our preservation; it resembles the provision for the perpetuity of mankind: it is necessary, it is dear to us, it gives us pleasure, and we must conceal it. \~Voltaire

# 8 Ways To Love Yourself

Starting to love yourself can feel like a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. It's true that self-love is an introspective process. It‚Äôs about creating a habit of kindness, patience, and acceptance. Here are some practical ways to begin:

# 1. Practice Self-Compassion and Celebrate Your Worth

Treat yourself with the same kindness you would offer a friend who‚Äôs going through a tough time. Instead of criticizing yourself when you make mistakes, try offering yourself encouragement and understanding. It might sound simple, but reminding yourself that you are doing your best can go a long way.

Start by recognizing your own value. Write things you appreciate about yourself‚Äîyour strengths, your kindness, your achievements. This practice allows you to connect with the parts of yourself that you already adore. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in what you think you lack, but reflecting on what you already bring to the table can help you see your inherent worth. Think about what makes you unique. Write them down and refer to this list whenever you need a reminder of your exceptional traits! As you move forward on your journey to self-love, you will go back and add new things to this list.

Dare to love yourself as if you were a rainbow with gold at both ends. \~ Aberjhani

# 2. Let Go of Perfectionism

No one is perfect. That you have to be flawless to be loved or accepted holds you back from loving yourself. Acknowledge your imperfections and learn to embrace them. They don‚Äôt define you‚Äîthey're part of what makes you unique and human.

You are conditioned to be competitive, so comparing ourselves to others comes easily. But there might be danger. Comparing oneself to other individuals on the planet is pointless since there is only one you. Instead, focus on yourself and your journey. It's the energy shift alone that will release you. In a similar vein, don't stress over what other people think or expect from you. You can't satisfy everyone, therefore it‚Äôs a waste of effort and will only make it harder for you to become the greatest version of yourself.

You are told constantly from a young age that ""nobody is perfect, everyone makes mistakes."" But as people age, the urge to succeed grows. You have to make errors in order to grow and learn. Recognize your past. You‚Äôre always growing and developing from who you were to who you are now and who you will become in the future. Thus, disregard the egoic voice that demands perfection from you. Make a ton of errors! You'll pick up priceless knowledge.

When you're different, sometimes you don't see the millions of people who accept you for who you are. All you notice is the person who doesn't. \~ Jodi Picoult

# 3. Set Healthy Boundaries

Loving yourself means protecting your mental, emotional, and physical well-being. Practice saying no when something doesn‚Äôt serve you, even if it's hard. It‚Äôs about prioritizing your needs and making sure you're not overextending yourself for the sake of others.

Some people refuse to take responsibility for the energy they emit into the cosmos. If someone is poisoning your life and won't take responsibility, you might need to cut ties with them. Don't think twice about doing this. It may be painful, but it's freeing and vital. Don't forget to protect your energy. It‚Äôs never rude or inappropriate to leave settings or people who are draining you.

*Self-love is an ocean and your heart is a vessel. Make it full, and any excess will spill over into the lives of the people you hold dear. But you must come first. \~Beau Taplin*

# 4. Practice Self-Care

As I become older, I'm realizing how crucial it is to look after your body. Following the basics of bodily nourishment‚Äîeating a balanced diet, getting enough rest, and exercising regularly‚Äîis essential to maintaining good health, which has a significant influence on how you feel about yourself.

When you take care of your physical needs and give your body the affection it needs, it becomes easier to meet your emotional and mental needs. Furthermore, you feel good about attempting to care for your body.

This can range from taking time to rest or doing something creative that brings you joy. Self-care is how you show yourself that you‚Äôre worth investing in. Start with small, achievable acts, and build from there.

It‚Äôs all about falling in love with yourself and sharing that love with someone who appreciates you, rather than looking for love to compensate for a self-love deficit. \~ Eartha Kitt

# 5. Challenge Negative Self-Talk and Yourself with Positivity

Everyone has an inner critic that loves to point out your flaws. Start to notice those thoughts and challenge them. When you catch yourself thinking negatively, pause and ask, ‚ÄúWould I say this to a friend? If not, why am I saying it to myself?‚Äù Replace the negative with affirmations or kinder thoughts. Trauma often leads to a harsh inner dialogue. You might internalize feelings of shame, guilt, or unworthiness that stem from your traumatic experiences. As part of self-love, challenging this negative self-talk is essential. Remember, you are not your trauma.

The people and environments around you affect how you feel about yourself. Create a positive space‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs through uplifting relationships, inspiring content, or nurturing environments‚Äîthat encourages you to love yourself more.

Put yourself first and don't feel bad about it. Women get accustomed to putting other people before themselves. This has its place and time, but it shouldn't turn into a habit that jeopardizes your mental or emotional well-being. Set some time to unwind. If you don't take the time to unwind and rejuvenate, you run the danger of severely taxing yourself. Whether it's spending time outside or just relaxing in bed, make time for it.

Your self-worth is determined by you. You don‚Äôt have to depend on someone telling you who you are. \~Beyonc√©

# 6. Forgive Yourself

You can't change your past. You cannot undo what you have done or what others have done. Find the inner fortitude to forgive someone from your heart and your head, even if you have endured a lot of sorrow and suffering from them in the past. Your ability to let go of the past will increase as you complete this task.

Furthermore, when you're doing it, allow yourself to forgive yourself for whatever harm you may have done to both yourself and another person. It was easier for me to forgive someone else for their destructive actions, but I've realized that it was much harder for me to forgive myself for not being able to prevent myself from being hurt in the first place!

Learning to accept and forgive others as well as oneself is a crucial part of self-love. Only then will you be able to go on with love and start to truly embrace who you are and your past.

You have moments you wish you could do over. Part of self-love is forgiving yourself for past missteps or perceived failures. Understand that you did the best you could with what you knew. Allow yourself to learn from the past and release any lingering guilt.

I must undertake to love myself and to respect myself as though my very life depends upon self-love and self-respect. \~Maya Angelou

# 7. Practice Gratitude

Focusing on what you‚Äôre grateful for can help shift your perspective toward a positive mindset. Start small‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs gratitude for a warm cup of coffee, a delightful conversation, or your health. As you build a habit of gratitude, you‚Äôll naturally cultivate a deeper appreciation for yourself and your life.

Gratitude is a powerful emotion that may help you shift your perspective from one of pessimism to optimism. Its various benefits, such as improving sleep, reducing anxiety and depression, and increasing overall life satisfaction, have been shown in several studies.

One of the best ways to incorporate thanksgiving into your life is to make it a daily habit. Scheduling time each day to jot down three to five items for which you are grateful for might accomplish this. To remind yourself that you are already lucky, go back to this list whenever you are feeling down, unworthy, or in need of a little mental boost.

A purposeful practice of gratitude fosters a sense of abundance and acceptance, which both leads to a stronger sense of self and existence, and it raises your appreciation of everything in your life, no matter how small.

When you take care of yourself, you‚Äôre a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better. \~Solange Knowles

# 8. Be Patient and Kind with the Process

Self-love is not an overnight transformation. It‚Äôs a practice. You won‚Äôt be able to flip a switch and suddenly feel completely at peace with yourself. Give yourself grace as you go through the ups and downs of this process. The key is consistency and understanding that it‚Äôs okay to be a work in progress.

Trauma recovery is not linear. Some days will feel better, and others might feel overwhelming. Self-love in this process means having patience with yourself, acknowledging that healing takes time, and not expecting perfection. It‚Äôs about being okay with the difficulties and still treating yourself with care and gentleness.

Remember, loving yourself is about taking the time and care to recognize your value, treat yourself kindly, and make decisions that honor your well-being. Starting small and gradually building these habits will help you create a more loving relationship with yourself.

You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection. \~Buddha

# How Self-Love Extends to Others

When you can see your own value and worth, it's much easier to see the same in others. It therefore becomes easier to establish positive relationships. Additionally, the more you learn to love and respect yourself, the easier it‚Äôs being kind to others.

1. When you love yourself, you're more comfortable in your own skin, which radiates confidence. This confidence can inspire others to feel comfortable around you, creating a positive and safe space for people to connect.
2. Loving yourself means understanding your worth and setting boundaries that protect your mental and emotional well-being. This teaches others how to respect you, and often encourages them to practice self-respect as well.
3. When you treat yourself with kindness and compassion, you're more likely to extend the same to others. Self-love can make you more patient and understanding, which helps in building deeper, more meaningful relationships.
4. Self-love is a catalyst for personal growth and healing. As you work on being your best self, you become more equipped to support and encourage others on their own journeys.
5. When you radiate self-love, you're likely to attract others to your tribe who are on a similar wavelength. This creates a circle of support where love and positivity flow freely.

So when you love yourself, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre lighting a candle in a room that brightens the entire space. It helps you grow and thrive, and it has a powerful, positive impact on everyone around you.

Not only do self-love and love of others go hand in hand, but ultimately they are indistinguishable. \~M. Scott Peck

# Moving Forward Loving Self And Others

¬†

Trauma may have shaped your narrative in ways that feel limiting or defining, but self-love invites you to rewrite your story. You are more than your past, and part of loving yourself is acknowledging that you have the power to shape your future, regardless of what you‚Äôve been through.

¬†

After trauma, you may feel disconnected from who you were before or unsure of who you are now. Self-love is about re-establishing a loving relationship with yourself, accepting both the person you were and the person you are becoming. It involves meeting yourself where you are‚Äîwithout judgment‚Äîand honoring your journey.

¬†

Trauma can make self-love feel difficult, especially when the pain feels all-encompassing, but healing through self-love is one of the most empowering and transformative paths. It‚Äôs about giving yourself permission to heal, to feel your emotions, and to recognize that you deserve love, peace, and joy‚Äîeven after experiencing trauma.

¬†

Self-love also means knowing when to reach out for help. You don‚Äôt have to navigate trauma recovery alone. Therapy, support groups, or coaching with me can provide you with the tools, guidance, and validation you need. Seeking support is not a sign of weakness; it‚Äôs an act of self-love and self-care.

¬†

Life is too short to waste any amount of time wondering what other people think about you. In the first place, if they had better things going on in their lives, they wouldn't have the time to sit around and talk about you. What's important to me is not others' opinions of me, but what's important to me is my opinion of myself. \~ C. JoyBell C.

¬†

As you take steps toward self-love, remember that it‚Äôs okay to take your time and lean on others when necessary. You‚Äôre allowed to heal at your own pace, and you are worthy of healing and love.¬† Please keep in mind that self-love is a process rather than a goal. Enjoy the process, be patient with yourself, and take your time!",1,1738668454.0,personalgrowthnow,0,1.0,False

But I am reaching a point where I'm *very* tempted to take a significant pay cut & get a more easy going job, but since my wife isn't working, that isn't a super realistic option.

1ihferd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1ihferd/homan_is_the_meme_coin_that_gets_things_done_and/,$HOMAN Is the Meme Coin That ‚ÄòGets Things Done‚Äô (and Deports Paper Hands),"In the chaotic universe of cryptocurrency, where Pepe coins cats and Dogecoin shibes bark for attention, a new memecoin has stormed onto the scene with a satirical edge: Thomas Douglas Homan (TDH). Inspired by the infamous ‚ÄúDEPORT master‚Äù and his no-nonsense reputation, this token isn‚Äôt just another joke‚Äîit‚Äôs a turbocharged meme machine for the crypto anarchist who loves dark humor, bureaucratic absurdity, and token burns that‚Äôd make weak hands tremble.

Who Is Thomas Douglas Homan?

Thomas Douglas Homan, the namesake of this gloriously unhinged token, is a real-life figure best known for his tough-on-immigration rhetoric as a former ICE official. But in the meme-ified crypto realm, $HOMAN reimagines him as a cartoonish anti-hero: a suit-wearing, coffee-chugging bureaucrat who ‚Äúgets things done‚Äù‚Ä¶ even if that means deporting weak-handed crypto traders to ‚ÄúFUD Island‚Äù while incinerating their tokens. The coin‚Äôs mascot‚Äîa stern-faced caricature holding a ‚ÄúDEPORT‚Äù stamp in one hand and a ‚ÄúTo the Moon!‚Äù rocket in the other‚Äîperfectly captures its mission: mixing political satire with crypto‚Äôs lawless spirit.


Origins: Born from a Twitter Troll Army

Rumor has it $HOMAN was conceived during a 3 a.m. Twitter feud between crypto degens and politics junkies. Someone joked, ‚ÄúWhat if we made a token for the guy who deports Shiba Inu to the pound?‚Äù The name ‚ÄúThomas Douglas Homan‚Äù trended instantly, and within hours, a unique deployer and token contract‚Äîprogrammed to include ruthless anti-rug mechanics‚Äîdropped alongside a website featuring Homan‚Äôs face Photoshopped onto Mount Rushmore. The rest is meme history.


Why $HOMAN Isn‚Äôt Just Another Shitcoin

The ‚ÄúDEPORT Weak Hands‚Äù Mechanism
TDH‚Äôs developers added a ruthless twist: sell your tokens too early, and your wallet gets hit with a ‚ÄúDEPORT‚Äù notice‚Äîa meme-filled PDF of Homan lecturing you about ‚Äúdiamond hands‚Äù while your remaining tokens are burned into oblivion. Track these fiery purges in real-time on www.homan.fun, where a live deportation tracker updates like a dystopian scoreboard. It‚Äôs the crypto equivalent of getting sent to meme jail‚Ä¶ with a side of deflationary tokenomics.


Built to Last: Tokenomics & Security

Unique Tokenomics: No lazy copy-paste here. The deployer and contract are custom-coded, featuring a burn mechanism that activates during deportations and a supply crunch designed to reward HODLers.

Locked & Burned Liquidity: LP tokens are sealed in a digital Alcatraz (and later burned), ensuring no shady exits.

Team Transparency: The 8-person squad (including 3 devs) holds <5% of tokens‚Äîno secret dumps. Marketing/KOL wallets? Also zero sell pressure, because ‚Äúdeporting bags‚Äù isn‚Äôt their style.


Meme Campaigns That Border on Chaos

The community hosts weekly contests like ‚ÄúDesign Homan‚Äôs Next Executive Order‚Äù (winners include ‚ÄúBan Paper Hands from the Moon Mission‚Äù and ‚ÄúBuild the Wall Street Bets‚Äù). Meanwhile, new features are en route‚Äîthink Homan-themed NFTs and a ‚ÄúDEPORT Roulette‚Äù game. Partnerships? They‚Äôre coming. $HOMAN ain‚Äôt solo-dolo for long.

How to Join the Deportation Party
Already dubbed the ‚Äú#1 HOMAN Token‚Äù by its unhinged community, the project boasts a lean $110,000 FDV‚Äîsmall enough to moon, big enough to crush weak narratives. Buy the dip, dodge the deportation stamp, and meme your way to the asylum.

Remember: In Homan we trust. All others get audited.

1ihfeph,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1ihfeph/my_last_relationship_broke_me_and_turned_me_into/,My last relationship broke me and turned me into the worst version of myself,"4 months together. Yes I know, how can such a short relationship do that to you?

Well, after 2 years of dating without success, I found this person I thought she would be my everything. We clicked on a different level, had so much in common, said I love you quickly, made plans for the future and even spoke to our families about us. It was like a dream come true.  
She came to me from an abusive relationship, still ''seeing'' him until she met me. I hated it at first, I was scared I was perhaps a quick replacement, but decided to let it go and focus on what we had. And I fell for her so damn hard.

However, 3 weeks into the relationship she started her own business, running it from home. I was nothing but supportive of her. I knew that Tuesday to Friday she had to make preparations, Saturday and Sunday go out and sell. That left 1 day for me, Monday. I didn't mind at first, but week after week, she simply started to disappear from the relationship.

When we started dating, we would talk a lot during the day. I always had that in my previous relationships, this feeling of having someone think of you during the day, even if it's a small ''Have you eaten?'' , ''Thinking of you''.  However, she changed so much. Once we were officially together, our communication was a simple good morning at 8am and then a quick call or message at 12 at night.

I tried to tell her that I would love a small message or a quick call, anything to feel that she is still there. I got back nothing but ''You are being sensitive, emotional, needy''. I always made time for her, even when I was in meetings. I just couldn't understand how she couldn't stop for 2 minutes in 16 hours to simply show me she still cares. Monday's became a day of rest for her, doing nothing but sleeping. I told her I could drive to her house, grab a coffee with her for 15 minutes around the block. She said no. We did nothing as a couple, nothing that would deepen our bond and help us move forward. I tried to be as understanding and patient as I could be.

3 months later I felt so alone. I felt more alone than when I was single.  
And it was killing me inside. I started being jealous of her ex bf. He got everything from her, time, attention, effort, love, even though he treated her so badly. I treated her like a princess and I got nothing back. She said she loved me and she would try, but I failed to see it. She lied to me about a few things and my feelings spiraled. I developed retroactive jealousy for the first time in my life, asking questions about her and her ex, trying to understand what I was lacking. Why wasn't I good enough for her? Big mistake, I know. And I made her tired. I asked for her support as I navigate my feelings, explained that all I need is to feel I matter to her, and I will stop asking stupid questions. But she didn't have the patience for that. She refused to discuss our issues, and somehow I would always end up apologizing even though it wasn't my fault.

Eventually I became this annoying version of myself, always anxious, not sleeping, always on the edge. I would get annoyed at the simplest things she did, complain all the time that we don't see each other. I looked myself at the mirror and hated every part of me. I tried my best to drown my thoughts, but failed.

And she left me. Said she needed time to focus on her work and couldn't be with me anymore. Called me awful, annoying, exhausting to be with.  
And she was back in the dating apps the next day. Makes me wonder, If she never had time for me, how can she have time for strangers online?

And here I am, spending every day thinking why wasn't I good enough? I'm beating myself and wish I could change my feelings, become more indifferent that we didn't see each other, give her more space. But I am who I am, how much can I change for someone?

I went on a date with a great woman yesterday. She kissed me at the end and I felt nothing. I feel empty. I don't think I want to feel anything for anyone anymore.",0,1738667855.0,GuyCry,2,0.5,False

I started going to a cafe thats on my drive to work a few weeks ago, its awful, the service is slow, the coffee tastes bad, theres just nothing enjoyable about it at all, but I kept going to it every day

Talking to my therapist last week and we figured out why. I remembered that it used to be a good cafe and I used to go there when I was with her. 

She would track my phone, it ""made her feel safe knowing where I was all the time"", another thing she would make me do every morning was give her a rundown of my work calendar/travels for the day so she knew when I wouldn't be available to answer her texts within 5 mins of her sending them.

So if I stopped by that cafe on the way to work without mentioning it in the morning rundown of my movements for the day there would be hell to pay, accusations of cheating (the old greek guy wasn't really my type), not wanting to be seen with her (we would go to that cafe and many other places on weekends together), not wanting to stay home and have coffee with her (we had breakfast together every morning and I'd stay right up until it was time to go to work, this was a take away coffee for my morning meetings, my little bit of peace to start the day) 

In the end I stopped getting myself coffee from there and settled for instant coffee in the office, now my brain has decided it wants to reclaim that moment for me, I hope they improve the coffee but I'll still enjoy it either way.",8,1738667779.0,BPDlovedones,2,1.0,False

Yet, beyond its visual allure, Cappadocia offers a culinary journey that is equally captivating. The region's cuisine is a harmonious blend of traditional Turkish flavors, local ingredients, and innovative culinary techniques, making it a must-visit destination for food enthusiasts. As you wander through its charming villages and bustling markets, you'll discover a plethora of dining options that cater to every palate, from rustic eateries serving age-old recipes to upscale restaurants offering modern interpretations of classic dishes. This culinary exploration is not just about savoring delicious food; it's about immersing yourself in the stories and traditions that have shaped Cappadocia's unique gastronomic identity.

# Discovering Culinary Delights: Where to Eat in Cappadocia

Cappadocia, a region in central Turkey renowned for its otherworldly landscapes and rich history, is also a treasure trove of culinary delights waiting to be explored. The unique geography and cultural tapestry of Cappadocia have given rise to a distinctive local cuisine that is both a reflection of its past and a celebration of its present. When visiting this enchanting region, indulging in its gastronomic offerings is an essential part of the experience. From traditional Anatolian dishes to modern interpretations of classic flavors, Cappadocia's dining scene is as diverse as its landscape.

# Must-Try Dishes

One of the most iconic dishes you must try in Cappadocia is the **Testi Kebab**, a traditional Anatolian dish that is as much about the experience as it is about the taste. This dish is prepared by slow-cooking meat and vegetables in a sealed clay pot, which is then broken open at the table, releasing a fragrant aroma that tantalizes the senses. The tender meat, usually lamb or beef, absorbs the flavors of the spices and vegetables, creating a rich and hearty meal that is perfect for the cooler evenings in Cappadocia. Many local restaurants offer this dish, but for an authentic experience, seek out those that prepare it using traditional methods.

Another must-try is **Manti**, often referred to as Turkish ravioli. These small dumplings are filled with spiced meat and served with a generous dollop of yogurt and a drizzle of melted butter infused with paprika. The combination of flavors and textures makes Manti a beloved dish among locals and visitors alike. While it can be found throughout Turkey, the version in Cappadocia often includes a unique blend of spices that sets it apart. Pair it with a glass of local wine, and you have a meal that is both comforting and satisfying.

For those with a sweet tooth, **Baklava** is a dessert that cannot be missed. Although it is a staple across Turkey, the baklava in Cappadocia is often made with locally sourced ingredients, such as honey and pistachios, which add a distinct flavor profile. The delicate layers of phyllo pastry, combined with the sweetness of the syrup and the crunch of the nuts, create a dessert that is both indulgent and delightful. Enjoy it with a cup of Turkish tea or coffee for a perfect end to your meal.

# Wine and Dining Experience

Cappadocia is also home to a burgeoning wine industry, thanks to its volcanic soil and favorable climate. The region's wineries produce a variety of wines, from robust reds to crisp whites, that pair beautifully with the local cuisine. Many restaurants offer wine tastings, allowing you to sample the best of Cappadocia's vineyards while enjoying a meal. Whether you are a wine connoisseur or a casual enthusiast, exploring the local wine scene is a rewarding experience that adds another layer to your culinary journey.

When I was 16 I went on a student exchange to china where I met this guy (he was the exchange partner of my friend) We both kind of felt really attacthed to each other quickly, and at the end of the week-long exchange exchanged quite a few hugs and tears (nothing really happend we were innocent teens, he also a year younger than me) after that we kept in contact and he promised me via text that he would marry me one day (kind of escalated quickly, but there was also a language barrier and I feel like he really wanted to get the urgency of his feelings across). 6 month after that the chinese exchange people came to germany, and we had this weird ""He likes her/she likes him-everybody knows its awkward"" phase. There was definetly a tension there and again, at the day they left we had a very emotional goodby moment. He also gave me a handmade gift (a glass-jar full of tiny stars folded by hand) which I have kept until this day. We stayed in contact, not everyday but definitly every few month, updating ourselves about life, school, big moments like entering university... We always wanted to visit each other but both didn't have endless money, and even when he was in Europe and I was in Asia we seemed to miss each other just so.

Since then 7 years have passed and I am now studying in Vienna, and he got accepted for his abroad master as he always wished for in Sweden. Since I am also earning some money now and we still talked I just booked a plane ticket in October, to fly to Stockholm (my flight is next week!) to see him. Let me also say that I'm not overly romantic and don't expect anything. I really thought since he might be busy with school we could grab coffee and just catch up. However he surprised me yesterday by being equally excited, saying he already planned what to show me and to cook for me on the first evening.

Honestly I never really had a boyfriend or anything since all that time, and I kind of get the feeling it's the same for him so I feel like in a weird limbo where I am excited but also afraid, what of it's weird or awkward? I guess I just hope to get some inout from people outside of my POV because I tend to overthink a lot of things. Hopefully we can communicate properly (since I guess both of our English should have improved with both of us doing a masters in this language now).",5,1738667595.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

I had a sponsor, but he was just getting very pushy and basically told me that I wasn't taking the program seriously if I was choosing my job over attending 2 AA meetings a day. 180 in 90 was the requirement. And I said no, I can't do that. I have to pay my bills. I work in home healthcare. I have clients who depend on me. Fine, he said, 90 in 90. I was doing that and then he said he wanted me to go to meetings with him regularly. At 11am. Middle of the damn day. I tried to figure it out that maybe once a week I could do that, but I commute to work so I have to factor in travel and shit. Then he demanded we read a devotional together every morning. At the time he chose. Then he said that I should cancel my dinner plans with my girlfriend so that I can go to coffee with him and ""prioritize my sobriety"". Then he told me I wasn't ready for step 2 and 3 yet... Like what?? That's not for you to decide? You don't get to define my relationship with my higher power. Finally, I texted him telling him I wasn't interested in his ""help"" anymore and he was pissed but agreed to leave me alone. 

It's just been a nightmare trying to find my way into this program. Especially being a part of a marginalized community in my state. I've literally been threatened with a lighter in a meeting and called a slur and nobody batted an eye.

I didn‚Äòt think to much of it but one day i googled the company and found out it was an mlm. I hate mlms and got nervous. Did I get together with a hun?

But the stuff stopped coming in so I figured she‚Äòs done with it. And then the IT WORKS packages started to arrive. Didn‚Äòt know them but had a feeling and of course it‚Äôs another mlm bullshit company.

Sidenote: I don‚Äôt really know what her motivation is. Maybe instead of  trying to make money she is really just convinced all that crap will help her to lose weight and she‚Äòs getting other people to join so she can get the stuff cheaper.

Now I was pissed but I just couldn‚Äôt talk to her. I had lots of discussions with other people in the past and the thought of going through that again was already exhausting. So I decided for now I‚Äòll just ignore all that crap.

But she started to listen to group chat voice messages from her idiotic team (Hey girls ü§© I‚Äôm super excited to tell you about‚Ä¶ SHUT THE FUCK UP!) near me, reading and answering messages while we watched a movie so that I saw the chats and every time I started to boil inside because of the stupidity of these people: ‚Äû‚Ä¶ oh thank you so much for the keto coffee. It changed my life‚Ä¶"" EVERY FUCKING BLACK COFFEE IS KETO YOU ABSOLUTE MORONS!!! But I guess it makes it better when you pay $$$ for it.

So anyway, last night she was listening to a voice message again and right after asked me something that i misunderstood. I thought she wanted me to chime in. I told her I don‚Äôt want anything to do with any of that bullshit. She was pissed, we went silent to bed.

Today I was preparing to have a discussion where she would explain how this is important to her and a business opportunity‚Ä¶ all the classic crap they tell themselves.

Well, that‚Äòs not what she said.

She asked me what my problem was and I told her it‚Äôs nothing personal. Just that I hate mlms, that people from my family were (and are) involved with them, so I have experience and know what I‚Äòm talking about. Basically that all I see is she‚Äòs burning money but in the end it‚Äòs non of my business and her decision. I just don‚Äôt want to see or hear anything about it.

Her response: ""If that‚Äòs how you feel then I‚Äòll quit.""

Say what?! I‚Äòm speechless.

Sounds great to me and I trust her to be honest.

Now I expect that she tells her upline or whatever and they'll try to convince her I‚Äòm the devil üòà",24,1738667023.0,antiMLM,9,0.96,False

1ihf5us,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1ihf5us/hidden_diet_killers/,Hidden diet killers,"I've seen lots of posts on here from people stating that they are counting their calories but the scale doesn't seem to be moving. First, I would say that, just because the scale isn't moving, it doesn‚Äôt mean that things aren't happening. Taking measurements, progress pics, noticing the way your clothes fit and even assessing the way you feel other some other great barometers to track your progress other than the scale.¬†

However, if has been more than a few weeks and your aren't seeing any progress anywhere, it's probably time to take a second look at your calories.¬†

Here are the two main things that used to bite me:¬†

1) Eyeballing serving sizes. I would say ""Ok, so this is 300 calories per 5 oz"" and then eyeball 5oz. The problem was that, since I had never actually weighed my food before, I actually had no idea how big a serving size of something was. Weighing my food to get an accurate serving size revealed that I was greatly underestimated what a serving of something was and how much I was overeating.¬†

2) Liquid calories. For some reason, it never even processed in my brain that items other than foods that I chew have calories. That creamer that I put in my coffee? Never even thought twice about that and I like my creamer with a little bit of coffee. That little tiny sauce container I was dunking my chicken nugs in? Never even crossed my mind. And some of those little packets are LOADED with calories. For those of you familiar with Chick-fil-a, just one 1oz packet of Chick-fil-a sauce is 140 calories and I would have at least 2-3 of those per meal there. Don't forget the salad dressing that I used to drown my salad in. That buttermilk ranch is filled with calories that I never even paid any attention to. I just thought ""oh, I am eating a salad. That's low in calories"".

Now there certainly could be some other factors why you aren't seeing any progress but going over your calories is most likely the culprit.¬†

What are some things that have caught y'all off guard in regard to hidden calories?

1ihf052,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ihf052/i_19f_think_im_starting_to_hate_my_boyfriend_18m/,I (19F) think i‚Äôm starting to hate my boyfriend (18M),"For context, my boyfriend we‚Äôre together for 9 months before I had come into rough times and he let me move into his place. We had wanted to move in together anyways and it felt right. At the time I had no car or job, I was just doing college online. It did not go well at all, I think the stress of it all weighed upon both of us extremely heavily. He had lost his job and his car, we moved into his moms house and she had always been mentally abusive. Living in the harsh environment with what felt like no way out hurt us both. He would go work odd physical labor jobs and I would stay home to clean/cook/take care of animals/farm life stuff/etc. We both neglected each other heavily. Towards the end, I was able to go back to my home but he had decided to move up to his dads (5 hours away) to explore potentially better work opportunities. It was explosive, all the rage we felt collectively got let out once he told me he was leaving. Once he left we had calmed down, we were recovering and had a plan on how to repair and keep this relationship going because we truly love each other. This didn‚Äôt work out, it took him three weeks to completely cut off everyone. Week one he cut off his family, week two his friends, week three it was me. I had tried to communicate but it ended in him calling me an ‚Äúattention seeker‚Äù and saying ‚Äúall the attention has to be on you all the time or you can‚Äôt function‚Äù. It was rough. We talked the next day and he said he‚Äôd be better but then 3 days went by with no texts or calls. I broke up with him September 1.

After the breakup I was heartbroken but surprisingly okay. I went on two dates but ultimately focused on myself. I drove myself deep into the overworking rabbit hole. I was always either at work or at school. I‚Äôm guessing you can tell, we got back together (still long distance) in November. Things were much much better, he was better. He sent me flowers every week, suprised me with doordashed snacks and delivered gifts and paid for my coffee and called everyday and texted constantly. He was kind and considerate and caring and patient. After Christmas I decided to drive up to visit him and stay with him for a week or so as he had gotten his own home up there. His home was in shambles. No water, no heat, his roommate had dramatically left behind a destroyed home, it was awful. He confessed to me that all he wanted was to go home. He missed his mom and his sisters and he wasn‚Äôt ready for this. I called his mom the next day and we were driving back.

Now that he‚Äôs here again, this is where my problem starts. He‚Äôs still as wonderful as ever. Loyal and kind and caring. However, I feel annoyed with everything he does, i‚Äôm almost disgusted by him. Maybe i‚Äôm overwhelmed, maybe I feel unsupported. I‚Äôm navigating my family, my person time, college, tutoring him, my mental health, his mental health, and a puppy. Everyday is a bad day for him. Everyday I feel like I have to talk him off a figurative cliff. He won‚Äôt study on his own so it‚Äôs left to me. He needs to be saving money for debt issues yet keeps spending. He needs near constant reassurance. Even when we cuddle I feel like i‚Äôm comforting a child. He‚Äôs constantly upset that i‚Äôm not around 24/7. He repeats ‚ÄúI miss you, please come over‚Äù a million times and i say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry baby I can‚Äôt‚Äù a million times before I just lash out. I have no time for myself, I feel like i‚Äôm constantly caring for someone else. I feel like he doesn‚Äôt emotionally take care of me the way I do for him. Yes i‚Äôve tried to talk to him about it, his solution is just asking me if want to help him with something and then saying ‚ÄúNo no, nevermind your stressed‚Äù. I constantly feel like i‚Äôm being guilt tripped or backed into a corner. I‚Äôve discussed ALL these things with him in separate conversations and I don‚Äôt see a change. He‚Äôs pushy with sex yet I feel so unattractive and so unattracted to him that I don‚Äôt even want to think of sex. I‚Äôm so angry and annoyed at him all the time. I keep rasing my voice with him and i‚Äôm so so snippy at everything. I just feel so angry everytime he‚Äôs upset, it feels like another problem I have to fix alone.

I love him, god, I love him but I feel like i‚Äôm starting to hate him and myself. I‚Äôm depressed. I have no motivation. I don‚Äôt feel feminine at all (which is very important to me). I don‚Äôt even have the motivation to go to my classes anymore. I‚Äôm so tired. I just had surgery and i‚Äôm still having to take care of him constantly. I don‚Äôt know what to do or how to approach this. I don‚Äôt want to leave him but that vision I had for our future is starting to fade. I don‚Äôt like seeing him anymore and I crave alone time. Even more, I desperately crave time where he‚Äôll take care of me and hold me and love on me and compliment me and make me feel safe and special. I think everything would be fine if we switch emotional support roles, ya know? I don‚Äôt know what to do or how to fix it, I just need someone to tell me how to begin to fix it. I need SOME support, or at least someone to tell me if i‚Äôm being a horrible girlfriend. ",0,1738666152.0,relationship_advice,7,0.38,False

I got dumped/ghosted, my pet died, then a family member got sick, all this in 2 months. I‚Äôve been working too much and went out after work on Saturday. I got drunk from just one beer and one glass of wine, my friends saw it and gave me coffee and water and it helped. So we went to this other place where the men were very ¬´douchy¬ª and people weren‚Äôt nice. Normally I wouldn‚Äôt care but I was feeling exhausted and sensitive and had three more drinks to relax, it‚Äôs a typical place where celebs go so you know what kind of place I‚Äôm talking about. I should have been at a calm bar with nurturing people that night, since I‚Äôm feeling fragile and lonely. Those three drinks sent me into black out and I lost my friends. Woke up alone in my bed but felt horrible when I got up and saw two glasses of wine on the table. Then I had a glimpse of someone coming home with me. I prayed before going to the shower ¬´please tell me we didn‚Äôt have sex¬ª and yeah, I haven‚Äôt had sex since my breake up and could tell i had but no memory of it.

I think the worst part is waking up alone, if he were there I wouldn‚Äôt have felt so used and horrible. I could have asked what happened. I‚Äôm thinking if he thought I was crazy or something and ran. Were I unhinged? I normally don‚Äôt have ONS anymore, since I need to wake up and feel safe and cared for. So this is so triggering. I feel disgusting and like no one will ever love me. I‚Äôll die alone :( Feel like people think I‚Äôm a worthless slut. I talked to my friend who got lost and she said I was the sweetest and so caring to everyone there, but she could see I shouldn‚Äôt been drinking after being so tired because I got drunk too fast and she didn‚Äôt see me the last hour I was there and meeting this man. Remember two men being rude to me also before meeting him. I‚Äôm imagining these people all think of me as a desperate lunatic and I feel like I let my self down since I take pride in taking care of my self and avoid people I don‚Äôt like.

One day this middle-aged, Bill Gates-looking fellow was paying his bill, which came to $18.57.

After the normal ""how was everything"" exchange, I scan his check and say, ""18-57.""

He gets this mischievous look on his face and sharply asks, ""so, who was (U.S.) president in 1857?"" 

I still remember how large and animated his eyes looked behind his glasses as he grinned, ready to drop knowledge.

I quickly respond, ""James Buchanan.""

His silently gasps and steps back slightly. He looks like he has just seen the ghost of James Buchanan while one of my younger coworkers just says ""wooow.""

Unbeknownst to him, I was obsessed with US history as a teen and had a fascination with presidential history in particular. I'm sure this probably was unexpected from a kid behind a cash register.

Without saying anything, the man awkwardly reaches across the counter to give me a weak high five and then walks away, his moment ruined. 

I was kicking myself afterwards when I thought I should have also said Franklin Pierce was also president until the beginning of March of 1857. Granted, I'm not sure what adding that detail would have done to that poor man.",12,1738665698.0,PointlessStories,0,1.0,False

Georgia is known for its rich traditions and vibrant culture, and one of the sweetest symbols of its heritage is Churchkhela.

Made from grape juice and an assortment of nuts, Churchkhela is more than just a snack‚Äîit's a significant cultural artifact representing community, history, and family.

### Ancient Roots of Churchkhela

Churchkhela dates back to ancient times, with origins believed to stretch as far back as the 8th century BC. It is said that during the grape harvest, the people of Georgia would create this sweet delicacy to utilize leftover grape juice and nuts. The method remains largely the same today: fresh grape juice is boiled down and mixed with flour to create a thick, syrupy substance. Nuts‚Äîtypically walnuts or hazelnuts‚Äîare then threaded on a string and immersed in this sweet mixture, allowing it to dry in the sun.

### Symbol of Hospitality

In Georgian culture, hospitality holds immense value. Churchkhela plays a crucial role in this tradition. When visitors arrive, it is customary to offer them a taste of Churchkhela as a symbol of welcome and friendship. Sharing this treat highlights the generosity inherent in Georgia's cultural fabric.

How to Make Churchkhela: A Step-by-Step Guide to Georgia's Nutty Snack
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're looking for a delectable and unique snack, look no further than Churchkhela, a traditional Georgian treat that resembles a nutty Snickers bar. With its chewy grape must and crunchy nuts, Churchkhela is not only delicious but also packed with energy. This guide will help you create your very own Churchkhela at home. Get ready to impress your family and friends with this exotic snack!

### Ingredients You'll Need

- **For the grape must:** - 2 liters of grape juice (make sure it's natural, preferably from grape varieties such as Saperavi or Rkatsiteli) - 150 grams of sugar
- **For the filling:** - 300 grams of mixed nuts (walnuts, hazelnuts, and almonds work well) - 1 teaspoon of cinnamon (optional)
- **For the thickening agent:** - 100 grams of cornstarch or flour
- **String or thread** to hang the Churchkhela

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Preparing the Grape Must

Start by pouring your grape juice into a large pot. Add the sugar and stir well, ensuring it's fully dissolved. Bring this mixture to a gentle boil over medium heat. Once it starts boiling, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about an hour. Keep stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Your goal is to reduce the mixture until it thickens.

‚Äã -Plan Your Visit to Georgia Here--&gt;https://travels-101.com/explore-everything-georgia-has-to-offer  
#### 2. Preparing the Nuts

While your grape must is thickening, it's time to prepare the nuts. If you prefer toasted nuts, simply roast them in a dry pan until they are golden and fragrant. This will enhance their flavor. Once done, let them cool before moving on to the next step.

#### 3. Creating the Mixture

Once the grape must is thick enough (it should coat the back of a spoon), stir in the cornstarch or flour to help it thicken further. You can also mix in the cinnamon at this point for an added flavor kick. Then, take the pot off the heat and let it cool slightly.

#### 4. Assembling Your Churchkhela

Now for the fun part! Thread your nuts onto a strong piece of string or thread, leaving enough space between them. You can make the nuts into clusters or keep them spaced out as you like. Once you've strung the nuts, start dipping them into the grape must mixture. Make sure to coat them thoroughly, but not so thick that it drips off.

‚Äã -Plan Your Visit to Georgia Here--&gt;https://travels-101.com/explore-everything-georgia-has-to-offer  
#### 5. Drying the Churchkhela

After dipping, hang your Churchkhela in a cool, dry place. It‚Äôs essential to keep them away from direct sunlight which may cause them to spoil. Allow them to dry for about 3-4 days, depending on the humidity. The longer they dry, the firmer they will become. You want to achieve a chewy texture, so check them regularly!

#### 6. Enjoying Your Creation

Once dry, it's time to enjoy your homemade Churchkhela! Cut them into bite-sized pieces and serve them as a snack or dessert. They pair well with tea or coffee, making them perfect for gatherings.

### Tips for Perfect Churchkhela

- Experiment with different nuts. Cashews or pistachios can add an exciting twist.
- Use organic or locally-sourced grape juice for the best flavor.
- Pretreat the string with a bit of vegetable oil to prevent sticking during the dipping process.

Making Churchkhela can be a fun family activity. Share this tasty Georgian delicacy, and you'll not only delight your taste buds but also create lasting memories. So roll up your sleeves and get started; this unique snack is sure to impress!

### Conclusion

Churchkhela is more than just a delicious treat; it embodies the rich culture and traditions of Georgia. For centuries, this unique snack has been a staple in Georgian households, representing a communion of community, heritage, and culinary craftsmanship. The labor of love that goes into preparing Churchkhela‚Äîgrape juice, nuts, and the intricate process of shaping and drying‚Äîreflects the importance of family and friendship in Georgian society.

1iheq16,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSouthAfrica/comments/1iheq16/my_family_was_scammed_out_of_r32m_what_are_our/,"My family was scammed out of R3,2m+ - What are our options?","About three years ago my aunt introduced her new partner to the family, we‚Äôll call him R. He was everything dreams are made of (in her eyes at least). It didn‚Äôt help that when they met, it was amidst her divorce to a useless abusive lowlife so she was desperate to have that happily ever after now that she‚Äôs in her mid-40s.



R said he was married when they met but he assured her that he‚Äôs also in the process of a divorce. He also said he was a senior official at the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) and a successful business man with property investments and the likes.



Months into things, R moved in to my aunt‚Äôs place and they got into business together, boasting involvement in trucking, roadworks and supplying at broad. The family grew to trust him and involved him in the family business. In no time, R and my aunt began upgrading their lifestyle, vacationing at private game reserves, wearing designer, purchasing a Mercedes AMG and so forth.¬†



My aunt became the ‚Äúrich aunt‚Äù who‚Äôd foot the bill at family functions but the cracks of their relationship started to show. She‚Äôd discreetly give R her credit card to create the facade that he was doing well and it later came out that she paid for everything down to the clothes on this man‚Äôs back. They‚Äôd met my uncle for coffee and because my aunt forgot her wallet at home, R stepped up to pay and it declined. The bill was about R300.



Last year, my aunt took her daughter out of first year in university, went 4 months without paying her helper, gardener and the employees at her workplace. Things were coming down fast but it was only the beginning. She went on to acquire millions from the family, strategically making sure that nobody spoke to anybody (at least not immediately) for us to put two and two together. She employed the divide and conquer tactic as there was a lot of discourse between the people involved at the time.¬†



This is the timeline of what happened to my mom alone:



* 11th November, 2024 - aunt requested a R200k loan, giving the explanation that there was an investment opportunity promising double (R400k) in 2 weeks. My mom sent it over.¬†



* 20th November, 2024 - aunt requested another R200k, promised same conditions. My mom sent it over. Keep in mind that the 2 weeks for repayment hadn‚Äôt even lapsed.¬†



* 4th December, 2025 - aunt said she needed R200k to fulfil the remaining balance of the investment. My mom had begun to grow suspicious, so she decided to only send R150k, still hopeful because of who we all knew my aunt to be.



Every week since December, my mom was told that there are delays and that my aunt will settle the loan ‚Äúend of the week.‚Äù My mom then spoke to family and it was then when she found out that her two siblings and my gran were also waiting to be paid from personal loans given to her. Not only this but she‚Äôd withdrawn R180k from their joint business account without permission or prior notice, telling them she needed it urgently and she‚Äôll pay it back ‚Äútomorrow.‚Äù It was tomorrow each day to this day.¬†



At the end of 2023, my aunt took out R800k from another joint business account under the same conditions but the cover story was that she‚Äôs investing it in ‚ÄúThe Bank of China‚Äù and it‚Äôll have matured 1 February 2025.



* 15th December, 2024 - aunt said the apparent¬† company would be closed until 10th January, 2025 so payment will be delayed till then.



* 12th January, 2025 - my mom followed up and she was told that she‚Äôll have the money in on January 15th, allowing the buffer for the money to ‚Äúreflect.‚Äù



* 15th January, 2025 - aunt said she‚Äôll pay first thing in the morning but nothing came though throughout the day and she went radio silent.¬†



The next day, my mom went my aunt‚Äôs house, demanding answers. She said my aunt appeared to be going through it, like she was crying all night. My mom doubled down and demanded that they go to the said company that my aunt is apparently waiting for payment from right then and there. My aunt did whatever she could to put this off for about but eventually she went upstairs and got dressed. Of course, R was there throughout all of this.¬†



They went to some dodgy company and met the said personal assistant of the person they were intending to meet. My mom said she was closely followed by a questionable guy and the whole thing looked off, almost as if the characters there were in on what‚Äôs going on, place was run down, things were just off.



I got the idea to look up R‚Äôs name. I tried different variations as I wasn‚Äôt getting results at first but the results came alright. To my complete shock, R was fired from work in the beginning of 2023 following an arrest for alleged extortion, money laundering, involvement in a pyramid scheme, possession of illegal gold and other raw chemicals. The name he went by (at least to our family) was a derivative of his full name, making it difficult to find him out. He wasn‚Äôt working where we said he was working this whole time for at least two years despite him attending said workplace every day. This ongoing case refers to sums upwards of R5m and a greater operation at large.¬†



17th January, 24 - my aunt said there‚Äôs an outstanding¬† document that‚Äôs needed from the embassy to verify that she‚Äôs the same person since she apparently had a different name on these documents vs her ID which still had her married name. Said document is needed to release the funds and in order to expedite the process, my aunt said another R190k is needed.¬†



20th January, 25 - my mom insisted that they go back to the offices and follow up on the delivery of the document but my aunt insisted that the document must be delivered to the offices by ‚Äúembassy officials.‚Äù



24th January, 25 - aunt said document still hasn‚Äôt been delivered but assured my mom that upon delivery, it only takes an hour to complete verification. My aunt later said they got the said document, but that there‚Äôs a backlog of thousands verifications so it‚Äôll take time still.¬†



27th January, 25 - my gran reported to my mom that my aunt said she went to those offices with police to demand the money. Sympathy baiting, to appear as if she‚Äôs on our team, I suppose.¬†



Present day - the family is out just over R3m collectively and we have no answers. Having found out that R is a career criminal with a pending case for attempting to extort somebody upwards of R5m paints the picture that this may only be the tip of the iceberg and that he could be dangerous. 



In hindsight, we don‚Äôt even know the degree to which R‚Äôs backstory is real. Every cover story about where the money went comes down to him but he made sure that there‚Äôs no paper trail that implicates him. It‚Äôs my aunt that took out the loans, withdrew the money, arranged the deals and so forth. He built his persona out, patiently establishing trust over the years for this moment.¬†



R always had a sinister vibe to him. He's never not there, he‚Äôs there be it girls grabbing lunch, family events, whatever. He‚Äôs maintained control in this way. He began isolating my aunt and she distanced herself from the family and became a shadow of who we thought she was. She was the most trusted, the clear favourite and perceived to be incapable of wrongdoing because of her loving character. Now we don‚Äôt know who she is.¬†



My gran was formerly my aunt‚Äôs confidant before my aunt discarded her to please R so she knew the ins and outs and she says that my aunt had nothing to her name late last year. The house she said to have bought, well she‚Äôs barely touched the interest associated with paying it off. The AMG, well she‚Äôs a couple months behind on the car and she could lose it any day now. She‚Äôs said to have zero savings so recovering all this money isn‚Äôt a matter of just liquidating her assets. Meanwhile R brags about how he recently paid his car off, has a farm in Pretoria and so forth. Apparently, my aunt has nothing.¬†



The ‚Äúboo hoo I‚Äôm broke‚Äù thing is difficult for me to believe because there are certain inconsistencies for instance:

In late December, she was said to be struggling to get by to a point where the fridge was completely empty and she was asking for R300 for petrol because work had also dried up. However earlier this year I learned that she put her daughter back in university, one of the private ones that COST, might I add. My mom also noted substantial damage on the car when we went to confront her on the 16th f January, but the car was repaired when she showed up to a family function two weeks ago. Repairing these German cars isn‚Äôt cheap. 



This tells us that she isn‚Äôt in fact at zero as she claims. Her kids are well fed, going to the best schools and went on a New Year's trip whilst my sister faces potential withdrawal from highschool and her and my mom moving back home due to the pressures of being a single parent.¬†My mom went as far as asking that she sends over R50k to start, to pay in increments yet my aunt said she doesn't have even that and this was early January. The family gave my aunt permission to use the supposed investment (the ""Bank of China"" one that apparently matured February, 1st) to settle my mom's loan and in response, my aunt texted back ""I'll see.""

Mom , is it normal for baby not to be moving. Baby usually is doing the mambo at 10am. It is now 1pm and no movement."" 
Me "" well sometimes they can change sleep patterns and he/she might be sleeping. Try a glass of soda or a bit of coffee..."" 
Daughter--"" ok. I have a phone call appointment at 4:50 with Dr. 
Me. "" OK call drs office and ask them to let you come in and check baby's HR. Instead of phone appt. 
Daughter"" ok np.

We begin talking about baby shower. All the things she needs for gender reveal party . I told her not to worry about buying baby anything until after shower because he/ she will be getting a ton of stuff from everyone coming. She tells me she was out with her BFF the day before and everything they bought. I told her I had just ordered a bunch of stuff,I asked if she needed more clothes or anything. She says"" no I think I'm good. I say ok. I'm gonna finish my order and everything should be ready by  2 weeks for shower. I hang up. Put my order in online for Gender reveal pary. I call her BFF and tell her I bought Peg Perego carseat /stroller + cloth diapers, maternity clothes for her and other things. I'm so excited and decided to lay down for an hour before doing more. I get a call at 5pm 
My daughter is telling Me that the Dr. Couldn't hear heart beat. ( baby still hadn't moved since 10am when she got up to go to work. Drs opinion. "" baby might be flipped over. Not too concerned but she should go to hospital to get scan an movement check. Shes scared. Stressed. Thinking of what she's been doing that could change baby's movement. I rush to the hospital. Obgyn is not saying it but her actions are of someone who has to give some really bad news. She gets scan. No heartbeat, no movement. Baby died at 25w3d by measurement. Only 12h before he was kicking and life was happy. Her husband .. perfect understanding, patient is still in shock. Why ... why would this beautiful happy healthy girl of 23 and amazing husband suffer a loss so great. I'm angry at God. Angry at drs . Angry at so much. I've lost pregnancies beforehand.

1ihemkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1ihemkr/any_chance_ill_be_able_to_transfer_on_a_final/,Any chance I‚Äôll be able to transfer on a final?,"I know: absolutely no way. 

For further context beyond what im about to say, might be helpful to read the TLDR of my most recent post regarding how i got my final. 

Anyway, I will be receiving a final this Friday the 7th for sleeping through my alarm and consequently through 4/8 hours of my opening shift of my cafe only store. Caused the store to open a whopping 30 minutes late, and because of it, i ‚Äúcost the store money‚Äù and ‚Äúrisked our operations‚Äù. Yes i know i messed up, but again, I have concerns regarding whether i really deserved a FINAL for it in my most recent post.

I am a 3 year partner, long term barista trainer, coffee master, flexible partner, consistent weekday closer and weekend opener, and have NEVER received a corrective action in any form, from a documented coaching to a final warning. My time and attendance isn‚Äôt perfect but it isn‚Äôt significant by any means (meaning I‚Äôve clocked in a couple minutes late per parking or traffic once or twice over the last 5 months I‚Äôve been at this store). I have shown up 20 mins late to put the RP order away once (noncoverage) and was never talked to about it.

Because of transfer rules, you can‚Äôt transfer within 6 months of receiving a corrective action. However I live in my college city and need to return home for the summer because I literally will have no place to live here come May. Unfortunately the six month period wouldn‚Äôt end until August, but then of which at this rate i will be sleeping outside of my store every night. My plan is to reach out to my old DM from my hometown, who‚Äôs district i worked in from when i started at Starbucks to when i left for college (and for a longer time than she‚Äôs even been a partner). I have a great relationship with my old store, was a great partner with no attendance or performance issues, and my manager generally liked me and appreciated the good energy that i brought to the store. I‚Äôm hoping to plead with her (my old dm) to disregard the final on my record, especially because of my squeaky clean record and the means of the specific situation in which I received the final, so that i can come home and have both a place to live but also keep my job. I really need this and I don‚Äôt really have any other options. Any thoughts? Similar experiences? Ever see someone transfer with a final or even a write up? Ever see anyone get promoted within the six month period?

TLDR: strong partner with clean record hoping to plead with old DM to take me back despite my final. Not being able to transfer would cost me either my job or a place to live, as I will literally have no where to stay in my currently city after this college semester ends (3 months into the 6 month probation period) and the means of my final at this current store are truly once in a lifetime and not an example of my character as a partner by any means",2,1738664487.0,starbucksbaristas,3,1.0,False
