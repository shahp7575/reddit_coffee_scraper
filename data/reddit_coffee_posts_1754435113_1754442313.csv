**Original Post: Quality employee doesn’t socialize**

My report is a high performing and highly knowledgeable (took us almost a year to find an acceptable candidate for the skill set) in their field. The role has been remote since hire and is technical in nature without a requirement for physical presence anywhere to do the job, just an internet connection. I have two problems I don’t know how to address:

They’re refusing a return to office initiative and said they will separate if forced. Senior management is insistent but they know we can’t go without this role for any time period for the next 3 years else lose a vital contract for the company. I proposed getting a requisition opened to hire an onsite replacement but was turned down.

They’re refuse to travel for team building events. They explicitly stated they have no interest socializing outside of work. We recently had an offsite team meeting they didn’t attend because outside of a vendor presentation that is admittedly outside of their area of practice, the schedule was meals and social events. I explained how fun it would be but they said having their “life disrupted for go karts” wasn’t worth it and it would be disruptive to their home life outside of work hours. They get along well with the team so I’m not really worried about the collaboration, but I think other people noticed they skip this kind of stuff and it hurts the team morale. Advice?

Edit: I think I’m the one who needs a new job. The C level is unreasonable and clearly willing to loose this key individual or thinks they will flinch and comply (they won’t). Either way I’m screwed and sure to be thrown under the bus. You all are completely right, t

To this comment:

>Good grief, leave this poor guy alone to do his work.

OOP's reply: (Even more downvoted)

>So everyone else has to do these things but not them? That’s not applying policy uniformly.

The commenter responded with:

>Nobody should have to socialize outside of business hours. He's just the only one with the clout to tell you no.

>They skipped the vendor meeting. That was totally during business hours. They didn’t want to travel for it.

A question:

>Have you tried talking to them? Or strictly threats?

OOP's reply:

>I’ve tried talking and reasoning with them, I don’t have any threats to make. They could have another job tomorrow and we’d be up a creek for the next year.

Somebody replied to that with:

>This needs to be communicated to your leadership. He has all the leverage here. Your company needs to understand that.

OOP replies with:

>I’ve told them until I’m blue in the face. I feel so trapped.

A commenter stated:

>The problem here is not this particular employee. It's the fact that you have allowed critical knowledge and performance to become too concentrated in a single individual. Until you can address this mistake so you won't be ""up a creek"" if this person leaves, you have no practical alternative to dancing to their tune.

OOP's reply:

>There are less than 100 people in the US that do what they do. This isn’t something we allowed to be concentrated, we literally can’t staff the position efficiently

Another commenter:

>This sounds like a made up story. If he’s not replaceable don’t make him RTO against his will.

OOP's reply:

>I don’t want to make him. I’m stick between dead set C level and an irreplaceable individual contributor.

>Your C level can't get what they want this time. They have to decide if they will let him stay remote or lose him. Those are the choices.

>I am assuming this a not real, but then again the world is big and full of wonders.

>You just need to document what you have done according to policy to cover yourself. Your company is stepping on a rake, you are just getting hit in the face first.

>Cynically speaking, you can try and call their bluff, but if you ""win"" and they RTO, they will not be putting in their best work. They will be looking for better work.

>Based on your comments, that means your company is ""up a creek"" and you should be looking to jump ship yourself.

**1st Update: Quality employee doesn’t socialize**

Well I went in this morning and talked with the head of HR and my division SVP. I told them flat out that this person was out the door if they mandated RTO for them. They tried the “well what about just 3 days a week” thing, and I said it wouldn’t work. We could either accommodate this employee or almost certainly lose them instantly. You’ll never guess what I was told by my SVP… “I’m not telling the CEO that we have to bend the rules for them when the CEO is back in office too. Next week they start in person 3 days a week, no exceptions.”

I wish I could say I was shocked, but at this point I’m not. I’m going to tell the employee I went to bat for them but if they don’t want to be in-person they should find a new position immediately and that I will write them a glowing recommendation. Immediately after that in handing in my notice I composed last night anticipating this. I already called an old colleague who had posted about hiring in Linkedin. I’m so done with this. I was blinded by culture and couldn’t see the forest for the trees. This culture is toxic and the people are poorly valued.

Thanks for the feedback I needed to get my head out of my rear.

>Hey, appreciate the follow up.

>Its a difficult situation, but I believe that's the best you could have done, realistically.

>Wishing you the best in the next steps regardless of what happens. I think you can see around the corner pretty well, so hopefully that will be appreciated in your next role.

OOP's reply:

>Appreciate this reply. Best to you.

Another comment:

>..RTO is intended to get a percentage to quit rather then lay them off, so..congratulations on sticking it to them i guess?

OOP's reply:

>They stick it to themselves. I’m not leaving because of RTO. Without a doubt in my mind they are going to lose a major contract because of this personnel fumble.

Another commenter asks:

>Just curious - when you talked to your SVP were you able to show measurable things that would be impacted if this person went away? Projects that wouldn't be completed, updates, that wouldn't happen... things like that? If so what was their response?

OOP's reply:

>They know that this person is critical for a contract we hold. They know the other team members can’t do the job and rely on this IC’s output to do theirs. They’re more focused on compliance from the employee.

This comment:

>A lot of companies are demanding RTO when it’s not needed.

Get this reply from OOP:

>I’m under the impression it is to justify the real estate holdings on the balance books.

A concerned redditor asks:

>Did you write an email to the SVP, cc HR, recapping the conversation and takeaways so there’s a paper trail of the risk and that it was dismissed? Even if you leave the place, people will still talk and word gets around

OOP's reply:

>I am in a one party consent state. I’ve been concerned about getting blamed for this and have been recording in person conversations. There have been so many emails about this, this was only the cherry on the cake for me, not a change in the conversation that’s been happening for months.

One last comment from another Redditor: (Editor's note: They are talking about RTO)

>It's designed to get your most marketable (and probably most valuable) talent to find new jobs while those who cannot find new work stick around.

>Not necessarily how leadership sees it, but that is what it de facto does.

>Bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see if it works out.

  
**2nd Update: Quality employee doesn’t socialize**

The most likely expected update from the smoldering ashes of what I would have told you two months ago was a stable and good job. He’s gone and I am one foot out the door and in to another. Within 5 days he had accepted a position with another company and had his laptop overnighted with a 8 word resignation taped to it, “I quit. New place said remote was guaranteed.” and they’ve been trying to get ahold of him since to make him a counteroffer. What a joke. Now they’re wiling to bend the rules for him?! They took away my credibility with him and the team for something they were willing to give up?!?!?! I’ve been given a list of concessions I’m authorized to make if I do hear from him. I tried calling once and left a polite voice mail asking for a 5 minute conversation. I won’t try again, he doesn’t work for me anymore, they’re expecting me to virtually harass him. I am done at the end of this week. They’re trying to get me to stay but I have another position I am moving in to. It’s a slight pay cut, but I know I’ll be able to be an effective manager there. I’ll likely hear about the implosion from losing the contract, but to maintain some anonymity for my employer, this will be the last update. And if on the off chance someone from my soon to be ex-employer does recognize this scenario, this was all preventable. Check the emails to Carl and Sherry, check my archived emails.

New page, new chapter. Thanks for everyone who contributed to my initial post in good faith, it helped me remove my blinders and see the situation for what it was.

Cotton wicks are the most common type of wick and are known for their consistent burn.Wood wicks offer a crackling sound reminiscent of a fireplace,creating a cozy ambiance. The size of the wick should be appropriate for the diameter of the candle; a wick that is too small will result in tunneling, while a wick that is too large will produce excessive smoke.

## faqs Section

answering some questions about heart candles can assure buyers and give them the best idea of what to expect from their new candle products.**How do I prevent tunneling in my heart candle?**
Tunneling occurs when the candle burns down the center, leaving wax around the edges.To prevent tunneling, ensure that the first time you burn your candle, you allow it to burn long enough for the entire surface of the wax to melt evenly. This usually takes a few hours,depending on the size of the candle. Trimming the wick to ¼ inch before each burn also helps to ensure an even burn and prevents excessive smoking. Also, avoid burning the candle in drafts, as this can cause uneven melting.

**What is the best way to extinguish a heart candle?**
The safest and most effective way to extinguish a candle is to use a candle snuffer.

A candle snuffer deprives the flame of oxygen, quickly extinguishing it without producing smoke or splattering wax.Blowing out a candle can cause hot wax to splatter, creating a potential fire hazard. Alternatively,you can use a wick dipper to gently push the wick into the melted wax,then straighten it.

**How do I store my heart candle properly?**
Proper storage can help to extend the life and quality of your heart candle.

Store your candle in a cool,dry place away from direct sunlight and heat sources. This prevents the wax from melting or discoloring. If the candle has a lid, keep it covered to protect the wax from dust and debris. If the candle does not have a lid, consider placing it in a resealable bag or container.

**Are heart candles safe to burn around pets and children?**
While candles can create a lovely ambiance, it's vital to prioritize safety, especially when pets and children are present.

Always keep burning candles out of reach of children and pets. Never leave a lit candle unattended. Place the candle on a stable, heat-resistant surface away from flammable materials. Be especially cautious with scented candles, as some essential oils can be harmful to pets.Supervise children at all times when candles are lit.

I’m 34, a parent, nearly six years clean from opiates, and have been doing intense self-work around family roles, trauma, and boundaries. I’ve come to believe my stepmom exhibits traits of a covert narcissist, and that I’ve been placed in the scapegoat role within our family system.

I want to be clear up front: I am not the victim and I am not blameless. I’ve made mistakes. I’ve been messy, reactive, and hurtful — especially and most certainly at the height of my opiate addiction. I caused pain and chaos that rippled through others’ lives.

# The Basement

In March of this year, I had the idea to set up a small play area in the basement of my childhood home for my son. My Dad initially supported the idea. “That’s what it’s for,” he told me. “I built it for kids to run around in.” That basement was sacred ground to me. My brother and I spent countless hours down there — building blanket forts, camping overnight with our friends in tents, drawing massive art creations on the chalkboard wall, flipping old couches onto their back and playing war with stuffed animals, and playing every other kid game you can think of: freeze tag, flag football and hide-and-seek in the dark. It was ours. A place where we were free to be kids.

Today, the basement sits mostly unused — a space with a big sectional couch, photos that have been pushed from the upstairs to down, a bar, a ping pong and snooker table, old exercise equipment, a few collectibles, family mementos, stockpiled toilet paper, and holiday storage.

Meanwhile, all the grandkids’ toys are kept two floors up, in a closet off the hallway near the old bedrooms. They’re brought down when needed, cleaned up, and promptly returned to their place.

My son, age 4, is high-energy. He needs space to run, to be messy and loud and wild in the best way. He loves dirt, worms, belly laughs, big playing — and it’s hard to keep him contained, especially in a space as rigid as the main floor of my childhood home. My stepmom doesn’t exactly exude an energy that makes room for that kind of freedom.

So when I suggested using a small corner of the basement as a play area, it wasn’t just about convenience. It was about giving my son a little piece of what I had — or atleast, what I wanted to have.

But when I returned in April to visit my dad, something had shifted. I brought up a Pinterest board I’d made with play space ideas — excited, hopeful — and my stepmom replied, “I think you should work on getting a play space at your house. You know this is our house, right?”

Her tone — and those words — cut through me.

My whole house was a play area. There was evidence of it in every room. And suddenly, I was cast as the one who had overstepped.

That emotional shift bled into a huge argument with my Dad. To be fair, I am sensitive. And I did react. That comment hit a nerve. Maybe because the play space wasn’t just about toys. Maybe it was symbolic of something deeper I needed. Something I didn’t know how to ask for directly.

So I used the play area — and the unused exercise equipment — to try and express the kind of space I wanted him to make for me. And for my son.

I wanted space back in the home I was raised in.

It was a sensitive topic. I hadn’t felt welcomed there in a long time, and my Dad knew that. I’d told him more than once. He even encouraged me to start a conversation with my stepmom, to ask her: “Have I done something wrong?”

But I had asked. I had tried.

I started to feel like maybe the problem was me.

After that, my son and I left. And since that day I — we — haven’t gone back.

I chose silence to protect myself and communicated a boundary: that I would only speak with my Dad in the presence of a neutral third party. He declined and insinuated my boundary was extreme and an overreaction.

# The Wedding

The evening of the rehearsal dinner — held at my in-laws’ Airbnb — her cold, bitter temperament could be felt from a mile away. My Dad didn’t socialize. She kept him tucked away, seated beside her at a table all by themselves. Not mingling. Just ruminating and whispering under their breath.

By that point in the week, I was exhausted by the digs, backhanded compliments, silent stares, whispers, and the ganging-up I’d endured. I was worn down. It was the eve of my wedding, and I remember feeling a deep wave of disappointment watching my Dad gather his things to leave. The Father of the Bride — the first one to leave the rehearsal dinner.

A few hours later, my husband, my brother, his wife, and I arrived back at the venue where we were staying. As we walked in, my Dad, his wife, and the couple they brought to “help” with wedding to-do’s 🤡 had just stood up from the back patio and were quickly trying to shuffle inside. The couple said “good night” and headed to bed. My stepmom didn’t say a word — just walked in through the patio door and went straight to their room.

My Dad paused to talk with me for a minute or two. I said, “Dad, it’s the night before my wedding. I thought we’d at least sit and talk on the back porch. We were all hoping for that.”

He said he was going to bed — it had been a long day. When I gently pressed for more, he finally said: he was being pulled in two directions. And he was choosing her.

On my wedding morning, she was glued to a violent news report. When I asked her to turn it down, she said, “After this. I want to hear what happened.” She turned it up.

No “Good morning.” 

No “Happy wedding day.”

At breakfast, I tried again — I asked if I had done something wrong. Her response? “We have bent over backwards for your wedding.”

She and her friend had already commented on my weight more than once that week. “You better watch what you eat so you can zip that dress up on Saturday!”

That’s her style: martyrdom. Passive-aggressiveness. Emotional withholding. She whispers. She triangulates. She positions herself as the victim — the one who gave and gave, only to be repaid with ingratitude.

# That theme repeats.

In her presence, I’m often made to feel like a burden — a disruption to the image she’s curating. I’ve watched her quietly erase me from spaces I once belonged in — like removing wedding photos I gifted to my dad of just him and me.

I’ve felt her defensiveness when I try to speak. Her resistance to self-reflection. Her readiness to label me ungrateful or difficult the moment I express discomfort.

There’s a story I can’t forget: one day, she pulled out two tennis rackets and said she bought them to kill barn swallows nesting on her porch.

""I don’t care if they die,"" she said.

The symbolism stuck with me. The birds mirrored how I often feel in her presence: messy. Inconvenient. Unwelcome.

They returned instinctively to a place they once felt safe — and were met with violence for it.

And isn’t that what I’ve been doing, all these years? Returning to the home I was raised in, where I was once loved, hoping to be welcomed — only to be reminded, again and again, that I no longer belong.

Then came another rupture: on my 34th birthday, I discovered a betrayal in my marriage. I won’t go into detail, but you can read between the lines when I say this discovery left me questioning everything I thought I knew. Who is my husband? Was our marriage a lie? What does my future look like?

I was in shock. I couldn’t sleep or eat. I couldn’t look in the mirror. I couldn’t stop crying. I didn’t recognize myself — or my life.

Around the same time, my brother came to town and stayed with my dad and stepmom. I believe — consciously or not — he was influenced by their opinions of me.

The weekend after my birthday and that devastating discovery, I went to stay with my in-laws. They love me like their own. They’re a huge part of why I’m clean and sober today. They are a steady support system — gentle, kind, and most importantly, genuine.

When they learned what had happened, they asked me to come. They knew I was struggling with my dad, and they wanted to give me a place to rest, to process, to feel safe.

That same weekend, my brother was making the rounds, seeing family and friends like he always does when visiting from New England. By that point, he’d been in town for about a week, and I’d only seen him once. My son missed him terribly. He begged to see his uncle again and asked if he could spend the night with him.

Over the weekend, my brother texted me a few times — once, twice, maybe three times — checking to see if I still planned to return on Sunday so we could spend time together and stay the night at our mom’s. Every time, I said “yes.” That was my plan. That’s what I wanted.

But I was barely functioning. I wasn’t eating. I wasn’t sleeping. I was in a fog — blinking, staring, unsure what to do with myself. I didn’t even realize I had an all-day Zoom class on Saturday until Friday night. I couldn’t tell you a single thing from that class. I remember messaging my professor to say I had family stuff going on, and he extended my quiz due date to Sunday at 5:00 p.m.

By Sunday morning, I was completely fried. I think my brother texted again to confirm I was still coming. I replied “yes.”

The day went on as usual — coffee, Mass, lunch — but after lunch, I went straight to the computer to work on school. Trying to focus was nearly impossible. A fifteen-question quiz took me nearly an hour to complete. When I finished, I just sat there, staring at the screen, completely depleted.

The weekend had taken everything out of me — emotionally, physically, mentally. I wasn’t trying to flake. I wasn’t trying to frustrate anyone. I just needed a little grace. Especially then. I needed my brother in my corner.

That’s when I called him — just to check in, to see how firm the plans were. I tried to explain: I was in survival mode, overstimulated, sleep-deprived, emotionally traumatized. But what I meant as a vulnerable moment, he interpreted as rejection.

He needed structure. I needed compassion. Neither of us felt seen.

He expected me to return. And when I called to ask if there was any flexibility, it triggered what turned into an hours-long, heated phone call that lasted until 2 or 3 a.m. My mom got pulled in. We woke her up to mediate. She said, “I think your brother’s right. You should’ve just not agreed to come back.”

That’s when everything exploded. I went upstairs and slept on the floor in my son’s room. We left at 6:30 the next morning. I was too broken to even consider talking through it.

In the weeks that followed, the silence was deafening. No word from my brother.

He was using phrases I’d only heard from my Dad and stepmom, and that caught me off guard. Hearing them from someone who has always been my ally felt like a punch in the gut. My worst fear Have they all been talking about me? Were they all believing the same story? 

The covert narc doesn’t isolate you with cruelty. She isolates you with consensus.

I was confused. I was hurt. But I was okay. I chose quiet. I wanted to heal.

Now, I’m painted as unstable. The overreactor. The one who can't quite get it together. The one that can't regulate.

It is my opinion that my stepmom has had a hand in all of this, and slowly, through tone, suggestion, and quiet reframing, my dad and brother have been recruited to see a different version, a distorted version of me. They speak, defend, and interpret *me* through *her* lens. And when I react, it only confirms what they've been told. They don’t see the setup — only my response: the one who can't keep it together.

But that’s the nature of a covert narcissist. I didn’t even have a name for it at first. All I knew was that I constantly felt off-balance. Like I was too much and not enough at the same time. Finding language for what I’d been experiencing didn’t make me bitter. It made me *sane.*  
It made me feel *validated.* It helped me see that I wasn’t alone — and I wasn’t crazy. In trying to make sense of it all, I’ve read everything I can find about family systems, scapegoating, highly sensitive people, and narcissism — especially covert narcissism. I’ve spent years questioning my own reality. I’ve been told I’m too sensitive. “Overtherapized.” But the psychology, the research — it helps me rebuild a sense of truth.

**Now, I have began to understand that being the scapegoat gives a false sense of balance.** 

**If I’m the problem, then the family system doesn’t have to change. The loyalties don’t need to be challenged, the power dynamics don’t need to be shifted, and past decisions don’t need to be reconsidered. It’s easier — not right — to let the “identified problem” carry the burden.**

I still want a relationship with my Dad. But now I know that when “Dad” and “Husband” come into conflict, I will be the one who is asked to yield. I won’t anymore — because I’ve stopped asking to belong. Now, I’m quietly standing where I am, not shrinking because someone is asking me to.

I know what I believe to be true.

Let me know what you think.

For clarity, I am a private escort.
Also for clarity, I have a baby on my own via donation, the seating arrangements are a large few tables pushed together with office chairs all around. There is one lounge at the back of the meeting where I usually sit to breastfeed the baby so he stays quiet and on schedule.
Our meeting is at a community Centre, where there is of course no dogs allowed policy.
I am allergic to dogs. 
We meet twice a week.
I don’t have a sponsor 

I had 16 months and I’ve had a lapse.
I hate my home group now … it used to be so beautiful but I have one woman bullying me, talking over others and using me as her share.

I don’t know this woman. She’s been in our Home group for two months now and every time she shares she uses that time to berate me use abusive language and generally not stay on topic so for example two weeks ago we were reading a chapter about common sense I forget which one it was but it was from the living sober book. Anyway this woman turned to me on her time to share and said “it’s not God‘s will to have your legs spread for everyone to come and fuck you keep your fucking legs shut. It’s just disgusting if you’re a slut keep your legs shut. How hard is it? That’s all I’ve got to say”

When it was my turn to share, I stayed on topic and then just shared a little bit how I’m struggling and need to get a sponsor, I didn’t bother engaging with this woman. 

Some other women have told me that they’ve had an issue with her before and that she’s completely out of line. 

I went home that day and drank, I’ve been drinking for a week since. Yes, I let it get to me.
I’m in a very vulnerable state having just had a baby, and I feel so fucking stupid. 

Yesterday‘s meeting was a whole thing as well! 
This woman who tells everyone a different name so I actually don’t really know what her name is, she walked in late in the middle of someone’s share , just as I’ve gotten up to make a coffee. She starts loudly saying hello to everyone while the other member continues to share with a puppy in her arms. There were a few seats left around the table but she went and put her puppy on the lounge. An older member quietly said to her can you please move? As Layla is sitting there with the baby. She started to completely interrupt the other woman’s share loudly saying how I can get over it and the puppy is more important than a baby.

I finished my coffee and continued to feed my baby at the like dividing bench between the kitchen and the tables standing and rocking him momentarily leaning him in my arms on the dividing bench to ease my back pain, the aggressive woman in the group decided to come over and pull out a dog water bowl and put it by my baby‘s head placed the dog on the counter and fill up the water bowl. 

I get that we’re a room full of sick people were alcoholics for fuck sake but like come on ! Ugh what do I even do in this instance?  I’ve always been the underdog and there’s always one person that seems to have an issue with me even though I really keep to myself and have a few close friends who are already in the meetings. 

Sorry for the big rant. I just have a lot of big feelings at the moment. My hormones are still settling but even if I wasn’t home, I’d probably still feel like punching this woman in the face. ",2,1754441470.0,alcoholicsanonymous,5,0.75,False

Stuff that would have saved me years of confusion, embarrassment, and straight-up bad decisions. Things that seem obvious now but felt impossible to figure out when I was younger.

Here's what I wish someone had pulled me aside and told me before I learned it the hard way.

1. Your 20s are for figuring it out, not having it figured out. Stop panicking because you don't have a 10-year plan. Most successful people changed directions multiple times.
2. Lifting weights isn't about looking good, it's about feeling good. The confidence boost from being physically strong affects everything else in your life.
3. Learn to cook 5 solid meals. You'll save money, eat better, and people will think you're more attractive. Win-win-win.
4. Your parents were just winging it too. They didn't have all the answers. They were figuring it out as they went, just like you are now.
5. Comparison is the thief of joy .That guy's highlight reel isn't your behind-the-scenes reality. Focus on your own race.
6. Invest early, even if it's just $50 a month. Compound interest is magic, but only if you start early. Your 65-year-old self will thank you.
7. Learn to say no without explaining yourself. ""I can't make it"" is a complete sentence. Stop over-explaining and giving people ammunition to argue.
8. Your mental health is as important as your physical health. Therapy isn't for broken people. It's for people who want to get better at being human.
9. Quality over quantity applies to everything. Friends, clothes, experiences, relationships. Better to have a few great things than many mediocre ones.
10. Learn basic home maintenance. Unclogging a drain, changing a tire, using basic tools. YouTube is your friend, incompetence is expensive.
11. Your job is not your identity. What you do for money doesn't define who you are. Don't let work consume your entire sense of self.
12. Sleep is not for the weak. 8 hours of sleep will do more for your productivity than 3 cups of coffee and pure willpower
13. Learn to listen more than you talk. People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care. Ask questions, listen to answers.
14. Grooming and style matter more than you think. You don't need to be handsome, you just need to look like you give a damn about yourself.
15. Have uncomfortable conversations early. That awkward talk you're avoiding will only get more awkward with time. Rip the band-aid off.
16. Your gut instinct is usually right. If something feels off, it probably is. Trust that inner voice, even when you can't explain why.
17. Learn to apologize properly. ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" isn't an apology. Take responsibility, acknowledge impact, do better.
18. Build genuine relationships before you need them. Network by helping others, not by asking for favors. Be useful, not needy.
19. Your comfort zone is a beautiful place, but nothing grows there. The things that scare you are usually the things you need to do most.
20. Time goes faster than you think. That ""someday"" you keep talking about needs a date on the calendar. Someday is not a day of the week.

⸻

**Orientation & Arrival**

So… you’ve found it.
The Yellow Sign on a subway wall. On the inside of your lover’s wrist. In the coffee stain that wouldn’t scrub out. You’ve followed it in dreams, through train stations that no longer exist, into alleys that were never built. And now—here you are.

**Welcome!**

Carcosa is not on any map.
Time runs strangely here. Years pass in seconds. Hours stretch like skin. The moment you step into Carcosa, you’ve always been here. It will feel familiar in ways that unsettle the soul.

Most arrivals forget how they arrived.

**That’s good!**

Arrival is best forgotten.

⸻

**Local Customs**

•	**The Mask is Mandatory**.
You may find yourself wearing one. You won’t remember putting it on. That’s fine. Removing it is discouraged. Removing someone else’s is… impossible.
•	**Silence is Sacred**.
Names are dangerous. So are questions. If you hear your name whispered by a stranger, keep walking. If they speak your true name, run.
•	**Do Not Speak of the King Lightly**.
He is not a metaphor. He is not a man. His court is everywhere and nowhere. If He looks at you, look down. If He speaks—listen. And do not ever interrupt.

⸻

**Notable Attractions**

**The Shores of Lake Hali**
Black glass water that doesn’t ripple. You may glimpse your past lives in its surface, or futures that do not belong to you. Many visitors walk into the lake, smiling. No one returns the same.

**The Ruined Observatory**
Where time was once studied and bled. The stars here whisper, and the equipment still ticks… though no one winds it. Many clocks are frozen at 10:14. No one remembers why.

**The Endless Stair**
Carved from a single piece of bone, the stair descends forever. Some say you’ll meet yourself halfway down. Others say you’ll meet the King. No one agrees on which is worse.

**The Theater Without Walls**
Performances begin before you arrive and end after you forget. You may find yourself among the cast, wearing a mask, speaking lines you don’t know until you say them. Sometimes the script changes mid-scene.

**The Library of Folding**
Books with living pages. Letters that rearrange themselves when unobserved. One book is bound in your own skin. You’ll know which one. You’ll still open it. Despite the screaming.

**The Hollow Market**
Located behind the city’s dreaming district. Time is the only currency, traded in years, memories, and promises you haven’t made yet. Careful what you purchase—you may have already sold it.

⸻

❖ Frequent Encounters

**The Mirror Men**
You may notice people whose faces never reflect. They speak backward. Their mouths don’t move. If you stare too long, your reflection may begin to follow them instead.

**The Masked Child**
Stands outside your lodging each morning. Never speaks. Hands you a flower made of black glass. Take it. The one time someone refused, the sun didn’t rise.

**The Man Beneath the Lake**
If you whisper the right word to the water, he’ll whisper back. If you listen too long, he’ll offer you a place in the silt. A throne made of bones that remember pain.

**The Caretakers**
Tall, slow, faceless. Often seen sweeping fog from the streets. Do not offer them help. They are tending to the madness so it doesn’t spread too quickly.

⸻

❖ The Play

Eventually, you will find it—or it will find you. The King in Yellow, bound in leather that smells of thunder and guilt. Most copies are incomplete, torn, or bloodstained. You will read it anyway.

Act I teaches longing.
Act II teaches madness.
Act III cannot be unread.

⸻

**The King in Yellow**

He is always watching.
He is always near.

Some say He wears no mask.
Others say He wears the first mask, and all others are merely echoes.

He is tall, robed in tattered gold. His eyes are sunken stars. His crown is crooked and alive. He does not walk—He arrives. The sound of His voice can unravel entire thoughts. His shadow bends the street beneath your feet.

Do not ask His name.
You already know it. You just don’t remember yet.

If He offers you the play, accept it. Declining is impolite. Reading it is inevitable.

⸻

**The Yellow Sign**

You will see it.
Once, twice, endlessly. Burned into curtains. Pressed into tree bark. Etched behind your eyes. Its meaning changes depending on who sees it. For some, it is an invitation. For others, a warning.

It is never *just* a symbol.
It is *always* watching.

⸻

**Lodging & Sleep**

Sleep when you can, but never where you last awoke. If the bed feels too warm, someone else was there first. If you find a note in your handwriting by the pillow, don’t read it. Burn it. You’ll know why later.

There are no inns in Carcosa. You may wake in a bed of rotting silk, embroidered with your birthdate and your final words. The room around you may be familiar. It may not have a ceiling. It may be watching.

Food is rarely needed here.
If you grow hungry, something will be prepared. If it knows your name, do not eat it.

Dreams are not private.
The city listens. The King collects.

⸻

**Climate**

The weather in Carcosa is eternal dusk. The rain tastes like memory and leaves stains that resemble letters in forgotten alphabets. The twin suns hang low and bloated, never rising, never quite setting. The air smells like pages long burned.

Bring nothing. The city already knows your temperature.

⸻

**On Leaving**

You won’t.

Some say those who do carry Carcosa inside them. They wake with sand in their shoes and yellow dust on their windowsills. They hum tunes they’ve never heard. Some paint the Yellow Sign without knowing why. Some write the second act.

Some bring others back.

You may leave the city, but the Mask doesn’t leave you.

There is no departure.
There is only forgetting, or serving.

⸻

**Advisory**

If you feel yourself forgetting things—names, places, who you used to be—don’t be afraid.

That’s just Carcosa making room.

**Notes from the Unbound Guide: Page Two **

**A Continuation of the Carcosan Codex — Compiled by Those Who Remember**

⸻

**Geography That Remembers You**

Carcosa is **not stable**.

Streets may shift based on your memories. Alleyways extend longer when you’re alone. Buildings you once saw in dreams now stand, rotted and real, by the seaside. Those who attempt to map the city often find their drawings changing while they sleep.

*“I walked east for three days. I returned to the same lamppost every night.”*
*—Traveler’s journal, torn and scorched at the corners.*

**Tips for Traversal**:

•	Do not follow street signs; they lie for your benefit.
•	The moon appears in the north. Do not look at it too long.
•	If the same street appears more than twice, walk backward until it forgets you.

⸻

**Temporal Anomalies & Misplaced Hours**

Time in Carcosa is **sentient**. It may **accelerate** when you are close to truth or **pause** when the King is near.

•	**Missing Time**: You may forget full days. Some return older. Some don’t return.
•	**Layered Time**: You may encounter yourself. Speak kindly. You won’t remember it later, but he will.
•	**Looped Moments**: If you hear a song for the third time in one hour, hum along. It’s rude not to.

⸻

**Known Factions & Phenomena**

**The Pale Librarians**
Tall figures draped in silence. They do not speak, only gesture. If they offer you a book, it is your duty to read it — even if it has no words, even if it is bound in something alive.

**The Choir**
Heard only at dusk. Hundreds of voices humming a single endless note. If you find yourself humming along, it is already too late.

**The White Lanterns**
Streetlamps fashioned from bone and gristle. Some say they only glow in the presence of regret. Others say they are watching.

**The Yellow Gentlemen**
Masked travelers in suits of desaturated gold. Friendly. Curious. Never blink. Never stop smiling. If one offers you their hand, it’s to lead you somewhere. Don’t look back.

⸻

**On the Second Act**

No one remembers reading the **Second Act**.

And yet… they all do.

Pieces of it have surfaced: etched into cave walls, found stitched inside coats, sung by children who do not sleep.

*“He has no mask now.”*
*“She dances with broken ankles.”*
*“The moon weeps oil for the Queen.”*

The **Second Act does not change** — *you* do. Those who finish reading it report the following:
•	The smell of **brine and burning pages**
•	The inability to pronounce their own name
•	Unrelenting visions of the King’s reflection — in puddles, windows, loved ones’ eyes

⸻

**Rules of the Unspoken Law**

These are etched beneath the city. Some hear them in their dreams:
1.	**Do not eat the fish.**
2.	**Never speak the Queen’s name.**
3.	**If the statue turns its head, close your eyes.**
4.	**Wear your mask when you cry.**
5.	**If you find the door with no keyhole, knock exactly once. If it opens, walk backward through.**
6. Above all, **do not mention the King unless He mentions you first**.
⸻

**The King’s Mood**

Scholars debate whether the King is aware of all who enter His domain.

Those who’ve seen Him say he wears **melancholy like a robe**.
Those who’ve heard Him say His voice is like a **horn across fog** — low, distant, grieving.

If His attention lingers on you, the following may occur:
•	Water stains on every book you own
•	Recurring dreams of **puppets without strings**
•	Words missing from your speech
•	Every mirror in your home turning slightly askew

If He smiles at you — do not describe it. Not even here.

⸻

**Recent Sightings & Warnings**

•	The Lake has risen. Three walkways now submerged. Do not attempt to swim. There is something beneath it that does not recognize you yet.
•	A **new tower** has appeared in the Southern Quarter. It was not built. It simply is.
•	The **masks are changing**. Some have begun to move when unworn.
•	Several visitors have **vanished**, but **their masks remain**, hovering inches above the cobblestone.

⸻

**Final Entries**

*“Carcosa was never a place. It’s a contagion of the soul.”*

*“I do not dream of home anymore. I dream of stage lights. I am always waiting in the wings.”*

*“I found the Yellow Sign in my son’s drawings. He says the man in the tower taught him. We do not live near a tower.”*

*“The stars are not wrong. They are singing.”*

Streetlamps fashioned from bone and gristle. Some say they only glow in the presence of regret. Others say they are watching.

**The Yellow Gentlemen**
Masked travelers in suits of desaturated gold. Friendly. Curious. Never blink. Never stop smiling. If one offers you their hand, it’s to lead you somewhere. Don’t look back.

**On the Second Act**

No one remembers reading the **Second Act**.

And yet… they all do.

Pieces of it have surfaced: etched into cave walls, found stitched inside coats, sung by children who do not sleep.

*“He has no mask now.”*
*“She dances with broken ankles.”*
*“The moon weeps oil for the Queen.”*

The **Second Act does not change** — *you* do. Those who finish reading it report the following:
•	The smell of **brine and burning pages**
•	The inability to pronounce their own name
•	Unrelenting visions of the King’s reflection — in puddles, windows, loved ones’ eyes

⸻

**Rules of the Unspoken Law**

These are etched beneath the city. Some hear them in their dreams:
1.	**Do not eat the fish.**
2.	**Never speak the Queen’s name.**
3.	**If the statue turns its head, close your eyes.**
4.	**Wear your mask when you cry.**
5.	**If you find the door with no keyhole, knock exactly once. If it opens, walk backward through.**
6. Above all, **do not mention the King unless He mentions you first**.
⸻

**The King’s Mood**

Scholars debate whether the King is aware of all who enter His domain.

Those who’ve seen Him say he wears **melancholy like a robe**.
Those who’ve heard Him say His voice is like a **horn across fog** — low, distant, grieving.

If His attention lingers on you, the following may occur:
•	Water stains on every book you own
•	Recurring dreams of **puppets without strings**
•	Words missing from your speech
•	Every mirror in your home turning slightly askew

If He smiles at you — do not describe it. Not even here.

⸻

**Recent Sightings & Warnings**

•	The Lake has risen. Three walkways now submerged. Do not attempt to swim. There is something beneath it that does not recognize you yet.
•	A **new tower** has appeared in the Southern Quarter. It was not built. It simply is.
•	The **masks are changing**. Some have begun to move when unworn.
•	Several visitors have **vanished**, but **their masks remain**, hovering inches above the cobblestone.

⸻

**Final Entries**

*“Carcosa was never a place. It’s a contagion of the soul.”*

*“I do not dream of home anymore. I dream of stage lights. I am always waiting in the wings.”*

*“I found the Yellow Sign in my son’s drawings. He says the man in the tower taught him. We do not live near a tower.”*

*“The stars are not wrong. They are singing.”*

i just need some support or advice i guess, i don’t have anyone to talk to about this and my feelings are confusing. i’m 32 and only got the full diagnostic picture completed a few months ago. AuDHD/“gifted” so not very good at relating to people around me. i was also late to the party of realizing i am nonbinary (AFAB), which is another complicating factor. 

i’ve never dated or had a romantic relationship, anyone i’ve ever felt that way about hasn’t been interested in me and i haven’t felt those kinds of feelings at all in about a decade. i haven’t been sexually active in that time, which i’m worried will seem weird to others. i was thinking of myself as asexual/demi and maybe even aromantic since my only experiences of those feelings i felt were fueled by puberty/adolescence. so i have no real experience with relationships of this sort, and i kinda thought at this point that i was free from having to worry about navigating the awful social situations surrounding dating, romance and sex. figured that just wasn’t going to be part of my life, and i’m comfortable with that. 

well, i recently had a hysterectomy as gender-affirming care (now 8 weeks post-op) and it’s produced some confusing changes to my sexual and romantic orientation. i was hoping my surgeon would say it’s just a temporary hormonal upheaval from the surgery, but she said that’s not the case. i suspect this shift is the result of 1) learning so much more about myself and how autism/ADHD shape my experiences + making a lot of progress with my mental health, and 2) gender-affirming care resolving some conflict in me about identifying with my own anatomy. so i suppose i am feeling more comfortable with both the concept of engaging in a romantic relationship, and the concept of entertaining a sexual relationship. 

a few weeks ago it suddenly dawned on me that i have a bit of a crush on a guy i know who works at a brewery i frequent regularly, like at least weekly for about the past year. he knows i’m unemployed, live with my mom, and rarely do anything without my ESA dog. so i figure that already doesn’t make a great impression, but i might as well shoot my shot since i have nothing to lose by trying to get to know him. last week, i worked up the nerve to awkwardly pass him a note on my way out that said i’d like to get to know you outside of work, here’s my number, let me know if you’re interested. surprisingly, he did text me the next day. we’ve been talking, and hung out for a long time yesterday at his invitation. 

friends, i am in trouble. i am realizing that i really like this man. i haven’t enjoyed another person’s company this much in a very long time, maybe never before. i am not sure if yesterday was a date (we just sat and talked at a coffee shop for like 7 hours), but i know i’d like it to be next time. i do NOT know how to navigate this. part of me feels at peace with just being myself and seeing what happens. part of me wants to take it slow and not pressure the situation in any direction, but i have a tendency to be pushy when i feel strongly about someone. i’m trying to hold back and keep my head on straight. 
but i know i already like him enough that it’s going to hurt if something about me puts him off, and there are some pretty big things i haven’t shared that i’m worried will do just that. how do i tell him i’m autistic? how do i tell him i’m nonbinary, and still not even sure of the details of my own gender identity? and how do i cope with it if i’m rejected because of those things? help!",2,1754440906.0,AuDHDWomen,0,1.0,False

I’m 5’6” and about 200-210 lbs. my diet consists of a lot of meat, potatoes, breads, and sugar. So I have been reading about the carnivore diet and honestly I think it could work for me.  I eat a ton of meat anyways.  My wife jokes with me that a hotdog is not a side to a burger.  I don’t understand why not.  So I planned for about a week while still eating whatever I normally did.  I cut out some extra sweets like ice cream the last 4 days.  I started Monday morning and I woke up craving bread.  I jumped on the scale to get a base line and I’m at 195.  What the heck?  I haven’t been below 200 in 3 years. I’m gonna assume I lost some water weight.  So breakfast day one I fry up 4 slices of bacon and then drop 4 eggs into the bacon grease.  I’m a teacher so I’m off for the summer.  I’m working outside building a large deck so I go to work.  I bring my water bottle with caffeinated water flavoring instead of coffee.  It has 2 grams of carbs per packet.  Not great I know but it’s better than the 1/2 cub of creamer 3 times in my coffee.  So I worked for a bit and came inside to take a break and get more water.  It was like 1130 and I wasn’t hungry from breakfast yet which is strange.  By 1 I decided I should eat even if I wasn’t really hungry.  So I had a chicken breast (leftovers) and some sliced cheddar cheese.  I dipped the chicken in some hot sauce.  Went back to work outside for a while.  Family was going to the food trucks for dinner and a thing with our church so I cooked up some bacon and dropped 2 pork chops in the grease for my self for dinner.  Not great but I was hoping to not want to eat at the food trucks.  I got temped but found a place selling bacon wrapped hotdogs.  I only ate the meat.  Went to bed feeling pretty good about myself and completing day 1.  At bed I take a multivitamin and a testosterone booster just started the booster so I don’t know if it’s helping at all and honestly I don’t know if the vitamin is doing anyrhing either but I’ve just taken on for a while

Day 2.  Weighed in this morning about 193. Diced up some leftover steak and mixed it into some scrambled eggs.  Along with 4 slices of bacon.  This was a mistake.  Steak and eggs go good together but not mixed together.  Ate most of them.  Little bit tired today but still feeling ok. Worked outside again.  Lunch I took some more leftover steak and cut it into long strips and after cooking more bacon I cooked the steak in bacon grease.  This was a great meal.  Took a little nap after lunch as I was tired. Not sure if it’s from the diet or working outside in direct sunlight.  Dinner was chicken thighs and some cooked broccoli. Could have used some of the hot sauce.  Legs hurt tonight but I also spent 4 hours crawling around screwing deck boards down too.  Thinking I’m going to have a couple slices of cheese as a snack before bed.  

I haven’t done much with dairy products outside of cheese.  I’m thinking I’m going to add in a glass of milk or two a day as it’s partially a comfort food.

For God our Saviour teaching us when he was tabernacling in the flesh commanded not to make his Father's house a house of merchandize.

# Best Beer Soap 2025: Find Your Perfect Brew!

Beer soap isn't just a novelty item; it's a genuinely beneficial skincare product that combines the cleansing properties of soap with the enriching elements found in beer. From hydration to skin-soothing qualities, beer soap offers a unique bathing experience.

In this review, we will explore the top beer soaps expected to dominate the market in 2025, analyzing their features, benefits, and suitability for different skin types.

## Key Features Analysis

The best beer soaps in 2025 incorporate a careful balance of ingredients and brewing expertise to deliver superior skincare.

**Beer Type and Infusion**

The type of beer used significantly impacts the soap's properties.Stouts and porters, rich in roasted barley and hops, often impart a darker colour and a deeper, more robust aroma. These beers contribute amino acids and sugars that moisturize and soothe the skin. Light lagers, conversely, offer a milder scent and can provide gentle cleansing.The infusion process is crucial; quality soaps ensure the beer is properly incorporated to retain its beneficial compounds without compromising the soap's structure.

**Natural Ingredient Blend**

Beyond beer, these soaps commonly include carrier oils such as coconut, olive, and shea butter. Coconut oil contributes to a rich lather and deep cleansing, while olive oil adds moisturizing and antioxidant properties. Shea butter is renowned for its ability to soften and hydrate the skin, relieving dryness and irritation. The best formulations avoid harsh chemicals and synthetic fragrances, opting for natural essential oils and plant-based additives for scent and added skincare benefits.

**Exfoliation Agents**

Manny beer soaps include natural exfoliants to remove dead skin cells and promote a smoother complexion. Common exfoliants are ground oats, coffee grounds, or finely milled hops. These ingredients offer gentle abrasion, stimulating blood flow and unclogging pores without harsh scrubbing. The choice of exfoliant depends on the soap’s target audience, with some formulations designed for sensitive skin using gentler options.**pH Balance and Skin Compatibility**

Maintaining a proper pH balance (around 8-10) is essential for any soap, especially those targeted for sensitive skin. Beer naturally has a relatively low pH, which can help balance the soap’s overall alkalinity. High-quality beer soaps are meticulously tested to ensure they are gentle enough for daily use and won't strip the skin of its natural oils. They are frequently enough dermatologist-tested to minimize the risk of allergic reactions and irritations.

**Artisan Design and Packaging**

The aesthetics of beer soap are also crucial. Many brands prioritize artisanal craftsmanship, creating visually appealing bars with unique shapes, textures, and colors. Packaging is equally important, with eco-kind materials and designs that reflect the product's natural and handcrafted nature. Attractive packaging can enhance the overall user experience and make the soap an excellent gift choice.

Key features of the best beer soap in 2025 include:

*   Infusion of craft beer varieties for unique skin benefits.
*   Combination of natural oils and butters for moisturization.
*   Inclusion of gentle exfoliants for smoother skin texture.
*   Balanced pH levels for skin compatibility and reduced irritation.
*   Attractive artisan design and eco-friendly packaging.

## Core Benefits

Beer soap provides several practical benefits that go beyond basic cleansing.

**Deep Cleansing and Detoxification:** The hops and barley in beer contain enzymes that help break down oils and impurities on the skin. This leads to a deeper clean than many commercial soaps, effectively removing dirt, grime, and excess sebum. Users report visibly clearer skin and reduced breakouts, notably beneficial for those with oily or acne-prone skin.

**Intense Hydration and Moisture Retention:** Natural oils, such as olive and shea butter, work in synergy with beer's malt sugars to lock in moisture. Unlike harsh soaps that can dry out the skin, beer soap leaves it feeling soft, supple, and hydrated. People with dry or sensitive skin often notice a notable improvement in skin texture and reduced flakiness with regular use.

**Skin Soothing and Anti-Inflammatory Properties:** Hops,a key ingredient in beer,contain potent anti-inflammatory compounds. these compounds can soothe irritated and inflamed skin, reducing redness and swelling associated with conditions like eczema and psoriasis. Many users experience relief from itching and discomfort, leading to a more pleasant and manageable skincare routine.

**Aroma Therapeutic Relaxation:** The natural aromas derived from beer and essential oils create a relaxing and invigorating bathing experience. The subtle scent of hops, combined with complementary essential oils like lavender or cedarwood, can promote relaxation and reduce stress. This turns a simple shower into an aromatherapy session, enhancing overall well-being.

**Gentle Exfoliation and skin Rejuvenation:** The inclusion of natural exfoliants like ground oats or hops gently removes dead skin cells, revealing smoother, brighter skin underneath.This regular exfoliation stimulates cell turnover, promoting a more youthful and radiant complexion. Users often report improved skin tone and a decrease in the appearance of blemishes and fine lines.

## FAQs Section

**What skin types are most suitable for beer soap?**

Beer soap is generally suitable for most skin types, but those with oily or acne-prone skin tend to benefit the most from its deep-cleansing and detoxifying properties. People with dry or sensitive skin should opt for formulations rich in moisturizing oils and avoid harsh exfoliants. It is always advisable to test a small area of skin first tocheck for any adverse reactions.

**Does beer soap smell strongly of beer?**

The scent of beer soap varies depending on the type of beer used and the added essential oils. Most beer soaps have a subtle,pleasant aroma that combines the earthy notes of beer with the fragrance of essential oils. The beer scent is typically not overpowering and fades quickly after rinsing,leaving a fresh and clean scent behind.

**Can people with gluten sensitivities use beer soap safely?**

While beer contains gluten, the amount present in beer soap is generally considered minimal. During the soap-making process and rinsing, the gluten content is further reduced. Tho, individuals with severe gluten sensitivities should exercise caution and consult with a dermatologist or allergist before using beer soap, especially if they have known skin sensitivities to gluten-containing products.**How should beer soap be stored to maximize its lifespan?**

To prolong the life of your beer soap, store it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and humidity. Use a soap dish that allows the soap to drain properly between uses to minimize softening and prevent it from dissolving too quickly.Avoid leaving the soap in standing water or in a damp environment, as this can shorten its lifespan and diminish its beneficial properties.

1miqadg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1miqadg/need_some_advice/,Need some advice,"My ex GF (21F) broke up with me (23M) on Sunday. We were dating for 2 years and had built a very strong connection.

She said on the day of the break up that plenty of couples who break up end up getting together down the line and end up getting married. We spend ours hugging and kissing and she told me how much she loved me. I was pushing to just call it a break but she wanted a break up until Saturday to see how she was.

We were having issues with intimacy and different love languages. She said she thought my needs weren’t being met. I’d react immaturely when she would turn me down for intimacy or affection but I’ve realised I wanted it too much and too often.

She said she felt caged. We spent 4 hours with eachother breaking up kissing and still making jokes and she told me how much she loved me.  But she just told me I want getting it.

She was insistent on calling it a break up and then we would meet for a coffee on Saturday ti see how we felt. We agreed to no contact until Saturday.

The morning after, she text me saying “how are you? I’ll see you Saturday. I’m very sad” I responded and she organised a nice park for us to meet and talk for Saturday.

I was still quite depressed here and not hopeful. However, the night of, her father texts me asking to meet for lunch the next day saying “Let’s talk tomorrow. Phoebe in charge of her destiny. Some fatherly advice from me in the interim.” I saw him yesterday expecting the worst but he told me he went to see me on his own accord (we have a good relationship) he told me that she didn’t send him but he told her he was seeing me and she said it would be good. He told me her reaction on Sunday was likely a big blowup of her emotions and she went to the extreme.

She knows my parents are overseas and I struggle with anxiety so I’m was thinking this could just be a welfare check. He ended up crying with me and told me that his gut feeling is saying it isn’t over. He gave me advice on how to approach Saturday and gave me advice on my anxiety. He told me he would tell her how the conversation went but leave out specifics.

I want to understand a new perceptive on what I could expect on Saturday. Is there a chance she will want to try again and we can move past this?",1,1754440204.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1miq4ut,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1miq4ut,8 Day Solo Trip,"Hi all! Thanks to this subreddit and the amount of info here, I was able to make a really great solo trip for myself. I wanted to document my experience here also for other to use in the future is anyone finds this when googling solo trip ideas for Iceland

I focused my trip on hiking and trying to hit some of the major highland locations in the South. I rented a Land Cruiser form Lotus with the full insurance and everything went super smoothly and it was plenty enough for all the river crossings. I just slept in the back of the car at campsites and that worked beautifully the whole trip.

**Day 1**: I had planned to immediately hike to Glymur Waterfall but the smog from the recent eruption that happened a week earlier was very bad at this point, and visibility was like almost nothing. So I skipped that and drove to my destination that night at Kerlingarfjöll while stopping at Geysir and Gullfoss along the way.

**Day 2**: Hike around Hveradalir in Kerlingarfjöll, drive back towards Gullfoss (detour to eat at Efstidalur II), through Flúðir and towards Háifoss. Then took F225 into Landmannalaugar. F225 was beautiful but I didn't get to see much of the landscape still because of a combination of smog and normal rain fog. 

**Day 3**: Hike the Grænihryggur (Green Ridge) trail. This trail is BEAUTIFUL and a perfect choice for people wanting to avoid lots of people. I started the trail at 6AM, finished at 10AM, and did not see a single person, and no one was at the trailhead when I got back either. I had amazing panoramic views of the area all to myself. I wish I had spent a lot more time at Landmannalaugar and it is one of the main reasons that I know I will revisit the country. It was the most beautiful landscape I've ever seen. 

I took F208 south out of Landmannalaugar which was a wonderful drive, lots of river crossings but mostly small ones. Unfortunately there was still a lot of fog from the rain so I didn't get to see very much, but the drive was still awesome. I drove to Kirkjubæjarklaustur and ate at Systrakaffi which was a nice little cafe. Then camped at Skaftafell.

**Day 4**: Beautiful sunny day. Hiked up Mulagljufur Canyon which was an easier hike than I thought it'd be. Then drove to the glacier tour I booked with Glacier Adventures. I booked the ""The Glacier Adventure Summer Tour"" specifically. Our guide was Mihai and he was awesome! Since it was such a nice day out on the glacier we did a little more ice climbing than we normally would have done, and got to explore a few moulins. I was the only solo person in the group but Mihai made sure that I felt included in the discussions and he seemed genuinely excited and interested in getting to know everyone and where they were from. 

I then drove to Höfn and ate some really good lobster soup at Ishusid Pizzeria. Höfn was my favorite town and I genuinely wanted to move there as soon as I drove into it. It was so lively, people playing in the parks and sport fields. Very nice vibe. Then drove to Hvalnes Lighthouse before drive back to Vestrahorn to camp there for the night. Unfortunately I did not get to see the Vestrahorn mountains from Stokksnes beach because of very low clouds and fog blocking the views that evening and the next morning. 

**Day 5**: Drive back to Skaftafell, hike to Svartifoss and further up the mountain to Kristínartindar. Again unfortunately I did not get to hike all the way to Kristínartindar because of bad fog and it would have been a useless hike. I drove all the way back to Vik where I used my extra time from skipping part of the hike to just relax with a coffee and also eat at Black Crust Pizzeria. Took some pictures and walked around, then visited Dyrhólaey where there were a bunch of puffins and I was lucky that one perched close enough for me to get it with my 35mm lens. Then I hiked up the Reynisfjall mountain to the overlook where I stayed for the rest of the evening. Had the whole overlook to myself also. 

**Day 6**: So this was an interesting day. When I booked the trip, I planned in an extra day because I knew how volatile the weather is in Iceland and I knew the weather may really mess up my plans especially with hiking. I'm REALLY glad I did this because this Day 6 was going to by cloudy and rainy, but the next two days would be not rainy and even kind of sunny. And I would be in Þakgil and Þórsmörk for those next two days. So I used this day as a rest day to just chill in Vik. I got more coffee at Lava Coffee, visited Reynisfjara beach, and ate at Smiðjan Brugghús which was one of the best burgers I've ever had. Then drove to Þakgil to camp that night.

**Day 7:** I woke up at 6AM and did the Eastern portion of the Yellow Trail up to Huldujökull panoramic view, then took the western side back down, making a detour down the Red Trail to Maelifell. I can't stress this enough for people considering this trail, MAKE THE DETOUR TO MAELIFELL. It was by far the best part of the trail and best view in the area. You are way above everything and it's not a hard climb to the top at all. Anyone capable of the yellow trail would be able to do this.   
  
I emphasis this so much because the red trail is no longer on the official map. They took it off because the Southern end is so steep and includes large river crossings. But the detour to Maelifell and back is like 3km or something and does not go through the harder parts, those are all South of Maelifell. The red trial is still physically marked so it's easy to follow, it's just not on the official map back at the campsite. After the detour, you can just take the shared yellow/red trail back down to the campsite. I didn't do the southern portion of the red trail because the guy in the hut at the campsite told me those river crossings would likely be thigh high, and I didn't want to risk that solo. And once again, I had the entire trail to myself almost. I only saw/met people on the trail until after I was already coming back down the shared red/yellow trail. And it was 11PM at this point. So for 5 hours I had all of the amazing scenery of Þakgil too myself.

After this I drove around a bit back and forth on the highway to charge up my phone and power brick, then to Skógafoss where I camped that night. 

**Day 8**: Drive to Þórsmörk and along the way stop at Seljalandsfoss, Nauthúsagil, Gigjokull glacier, Stakkholtsgja canyon, and finally the Básar campsite. This drive wouldn't have been possible or at least would have been more risky past Gigjokull glacier without the Land Cruiser. This was the only point in my trip where that car felt justified. The last couple rivers before getting into Þórsmörk are pretty big and one of them you have to drive through it facing sort of upstream because of the way the road is and it would be bad news for a car with lower clearance. 

I hiked about 7km up the Fimmvorduhals trail, it was the afternoon so I saw more people on this trail than others, but I was still mostly alone. There still weren't that many people. The trail has a pretty brutal climb from the big plateau onto the actual mountain pass but is doable for anyone who can make it up to the plateau in the first place. This is a trail I would really like to complete in it's entirety one day on a return trip. I just didn't have enough time on this one. 

Sorry for the **extremely** lengthy post. I just hope this can be a good reference for anyone who searches any of these hikes or place on google later on. And for those people, feel free to ask me any questions that you might have because I learned so much. ",10,1754439786.0,VisitingIceland,1,1.0,False

My husband isn’t totally sold on having a rug so he’s tempted to go with the “minimum viable product” size. But I think I agree with the advice that if your layout is floating in the room the rug should contain the whole thing.

8 may be wide enough to contain the whole gray sofa, but the issue is that 10 puts the edges directly in line with the backs. I tried searching for 9x9 for a 2/3-on approach but it’s just not a very common size. 8x8 is perhaps more common.

We don’t think we should move the couches out more from center, or should we? We had the layout further spread out to better align with the windows (when we had chairs instead of the teal loveseat - just got it yesterday) but with two couches it feels too distant somehow.

1miq1eg,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreeceTravel/comments/1miq1eg/greek_city_recommendations_inland_vs_beach/,Greek city recommendations (inland vs beach),"Hi. I will be going to Greece for up to 2-weeks (probably closer to 10 days total). 

I thought it would be easy to plan this but I am getting overwhelmed, as this will be the first european city without a convenient train system, which is worrying me.  And I keep hearing that Athens, with the exception of the parthenon, is basically a European version of Los Angeles, which is something I am simply not looking for.  But I don’t know if it is true.  For reference, LA annoys me to a certain degree (and you need a car anywhere you go), but I had been to Istanbul and I loved it (I walked everywhere too). 

Also, Soooooo much of what I am seeing online about Greece travel is beach beach beach beach, and that’s great, but I am not the type to relax at a beach all day everyday.  Yes, I do want to do some beachy things, such as snorkeling or just taking a day off, but I get too antsy about being able to go to the beach in the US and missing out on amazing inland experiences.  So I am therefore hoping to find inland cities with VERY walkable geographies.  For reference, on my travels, I usually do 10-15 miles per day on foot, if not more. 

And for more reference, are my opinions on Italy (in case Greece is comparable—which I assume it is but maybe it isn’t???):
- Rome:  love it. Grimy, but I can walk everywhere, there is tons to sightsee (Vatican, colosseum, forum, restaurants are not very good, gorgeous structures everywhere, etc) and you can walk thru the whole city. 
- Florence:  clean, must-see sights such as David(s), walkable with beauty everywhere, restaurants are better than Rome. 
- Venice:  a must-see city, but it is 100% tourist and just feels phony. Fake tourist food with bright-green “pistachio” whipped-cream in their expensive cannolis (yeah no thanks).  All the shops are masks and all the restaurants are quick-serve food thats passed off and priced as fancy.  Boat rides are fun and infrastructure is beautiful.  Again, you gotta go see it, but dang I think the experience is more legitimate at the Las Vegas version. 
- Milan:  great. Very different than other Italy cities. Much more modern and probably needs more taxis than walking.  Good food is available.  Feels more like a city than an ancient territory, but I liked it nonetheless (albeit I would not want to spend my entire trip there:  maybe 3 days max). 
- Lake Como:  naturally beautiful and charming city, but boring, unless you are doing water activities.  Fake touristy food and some rude customer service from people who hate tourists. You need a car or train if you wanna visit all the different villages along the lake. If you are walking a village then theres not anywhere to go because youre sandwiched between a mountain and a lake, so your only options are to walk to the left or to the right (ie you cant walk up or down). Still worth seeing for a very short while, maybe even just a day trip. 
- Naples:  good and bad. Down by the richy seafront hotels it is nice. Has some cool inner-city walkable food areas too. But walking inland more seems like a dumpster. Literally toilets and sofas and other bulky furnitures are thrown in the middle of the city. Rats are abundant and there is a sense of needing to be extra cautious.  Some damn good pizza tho and still worth seeing, and Pompeii is an excellent day trip away. 
- Paris:  lovely. Many sightseeings (museums, monuments, gardens, churches, shops, good restaurants and cafes/bakeries, even a disneyland, and an underground if you need a different sorta tour) and walkable and beautiful everywhere. 

So if youve read all that, (a) thank you, and (b) I think you get a sense of what I like and don’t like so much, so hopefully this can help tailor your recommendations.  


I am also not a nightlife-party person. I like coffee shops and restaurants and to a lesser extent, bars.  But I prefer everything to be historic (ie, oldest coffee shop in Greece).  I live in a big US city, so I do not care about their modern experiences so much, since I can have that at home in San Fran, New York, LA, Chicago, etc.  **And I do not consider local graffiti or local modern-murals (a city commissioned type of graffiti) to be inspiring or sightseeing.**

I definitely want to see Greece’s primary must-see touristy sights (parthenon, santorini, even tho it is touristy).  For my first visit, its okay if it is touristy (even tho I am young enough and hope to maneuver around and avoid the other tourists and crowds to a reasonable degree—I am the type that will wake up early to beat them to a site, and then swish and zip around them in a crowd).  


And I want to see some historic museums. But I will say that I do not know much about museums.  For instance, I know that the Louvre and the British Museum are basically the quintessential museums of Paris and London. But does Greece have a quintessential equivalent?  (I am sure they will have hundreds of wonderful museums, but I am referring to something with the same/similar status as Louvre or British Museum; hopefully I am explaining that right). 

Again thanks for reading this far and (hopefully) getting a sense of what I am (and am not) looking for.

Monday – UPPER + Evening Run

● 2km treadmill (15% incline, 5km/h warm-up), Incline Dumbbells, Fly Machine, Lateral Raises, Assisted Pull-Ups, Bicep Pull Machine, Weighted Row Machine, Incline Weighted Sit-ups

● Evening: 4–6km outdoor run

Tuesday – LOWER

● Same treadmill warm-up, Leg Extensions, Leg Curls, Leg Press (Linear & Seated), Calf Raises, Romanian Deadlifts

Wednesday – UPPER

Thursday – LOWER + Evening Run

Friday – UPPER

Saturday – LONG RUN (8km+)

Sunday – REST



Why I’m Posting

I’m proud of the progress, but I’ve noticed the weight loss has slowed, and I want to fine-tune my approach for thisnext phase.



My goals now are:

Drop the remaining 11kg (24lbs), Build strength and lean muscle and Train to run a full marathon in 2026



Where I Need Help

I’m looking to: Refine my training split: Is this structure optimal for fat loss + endurance + strength?

Level up my nutrition: I’m consistent, but could use help creating a better macro-focused or periodized plan.

Maximize recovery and supplementation without overcomplicating things.

Any advice, critique, or resources from those who’ve been through a similar phase would be really appreciated. I’m ready to move from ""winging it"" to following a clear and effective plan.

1miq152,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1miq152,Chinese takeout?,"For dinner tonight I decided to open up my first Chinese ration. This is the beef menu and interestingly everything is in English. I'm pretty sure this is milrat posing as a humanitarian ration. Hopefully someone with way more knowledge about these will chime in. 

It consists of 2 mains, 2 high energy bars, crispy cucumber, chocolate bars, banana chips, an instant drink and chewing gum. Weighing in at 2817 calories with a 5 year shelf life. I'm an absolute fatass for eating most of this 

The chocolate tastes fine but has a weird texture. The foil package had an oily substance on it but the chocolate was fine. A bit bloomed but fine. The banana chips are banana chips and I actually wish there was more. Mixed with the chocolate was the best way to consume. 5/10 for both 

The energy bars are a pretty standard survival bar and holy shit look at the dates on them. These would outlast me. They're also individually wrapped inside of that package so you can parse them out during the day. About the same texture as a shortbread cookie. A light chocolate flavor for that one. These would go great with coffee or maybe broken up into milk like cereal. 6.5/10 for both. 

The crispy cucumber was excellent. They're thinly sliced and well seasoned. A nice bit of spice when eating them that fades away quickly. 8/10. 

Now to the fried rices. They come in their own individual, insulated FRHs and these bad boys cook. Good job. The heating pad needs to be less powdery. When I took them out to take the pics they were covered in powder. Otherwise I need more of these. Now onto the stars of the show.

The left rice is the Lima bean beef fried rice and the right is the stewed beef fried rice. They were steaming out the packs. The texture on both was actually great. I was a bit worried that they'd be mushy. The only gripe I have was the egregious amount of oil in them. The Lima bean one had like twice the amount of oil as the stewed beef. 

To the best part. The stewed beef was the lesser of the 2. It was well seasoned but on the bland side. The beef was beautifully tender and delicious. It had green soybeans that added a bit of texture and bulk. 7/10. The Lima bean one was way better. Very well seasoned with near perfect levels of slat and savory. Well executed and the beef was tender. 8/10. They both lost points because of the oil. 

Overall I'd give it an 8/10 and a highly recommend. ",3,1754439508.0,MRE,5,0.8,False

1mipyql,https://i.redd.it/vkn0bbpvkahf1.jpeg,Guys 🥺 sad accident,"Last week we were all having a wonderful morning. Dogs were playing and zooming around the yard, splashing in their doggy pool. My husband and I were having coffee and picking veggies from the garden. Then we heard a loud crying from our new little puppy boy. He poked his eye with a stick in some bushes he was running through and it broke off in his eye ball. Super traumatic and tragic freak accident. The animal eye institute tried to save it but it had to be removed. 

We feel so guilty that this happened to our little puppy boy 😭 this was never on our radar. Luckily he seems to not miss his eye at all, and it still wild as can be in true husky puppy fashion. The worst of all is trying to keep a 3 month husky pup on bedrest.  Cutie one eyed boy!! ",36,1754439329.0,husky,8,0.97,False
1mipxrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1mipxrq/im_new_to_fasting_lost_50lbs_just_changing_the/,I’m new to fasting. Lost 50lbs just changing the way I eat and making sure I was in caloric deficit. Now I want to get into fasting.,"So quick background , 238lbs in april 2023, was drinking too much alcohol eating whatever unwanted etc….and just wanted a change, was stress eating and drinking due to ongoing divorce.

Once the divorce was over I decided to make a change, cut out the alcohol , and made sure I was in calorie deficit daily (lean proteins , lots of veggies , zero sugar yogurt , fruits etc.).

Lost 50lbs doing this in about 5 months.

Fast forward to now, I haven’t gained all 50 back, more like around 20. But I wanna get back to being in calorie deficit and kick the alcohol.

I tried my first 36 hour fast the other day and I liked it.

My question is what’s the difference between:

-48 hour fast (go to sleep after dinner on day 1 , no food day 2, and dinner on day 3.

As opposed to

Being in equal amount of calories deficit but not 48 hour gap in eating ?

I’ve heard autophagy is interrupted unless you’re in a water fast (I’ve heard coffee is fine but also not )

What would be the fat burning difference in autophagy as opposed to having the same amount of calories over the course of the same time frame?

Is the only difference the cell repair?

Thanks !

Until that day, I went home early to suprise him.
Then I saw my husband in our hot tub, undressed, with another woman.
I stood frozen for several moments and watched as their pecking turned to heavy petting. 
His hand disappeared under the water, and she let out a porn worthy moan. 
He groaned and mumbled something I couldn't hear, and she reached into the water to grab him as well. 
When he lifted her onto his lap, he finally saw me... standing in the doorway between our home and the back yard, tears streaming down my face.
I couldn’t bear it anymore.
""Ben!"" I yelled, my voice echoing in the air. 
Anger boiling in my veins. How could he do this to me?
————————
 Melanie
“What time will you be home?” I handed Ben his travel cup and briefcase.
“I think it will be an early night for once… how about you meet me in the city, and we can go dinner tonight?” Ben shrugged on his coat and gave me a hopeful look.
“That sounds lovely. I’ll Uber to your work that way we can ride home together.” I gave him a quick pecking. “Around 5 sound good?”
“Perfect.” He pulled me close to his body and gave me a second, deeper pecking. “I love you more today, Mrs. Landon.”
“And I’ll love you more tomorrow,” I finished with a little smile.
Even though we had been married for five years and together for ten, he never failed to remind me just how much he loved me. Ben and I grew up on the same street. He was friends with my brother and two years ahead of me, but by the time I was entering my sophomore year of high school, and he was entering his senior year, he had declared to anyone that would listen that I was his forever. We even survived the two years of long distance, and he proposed the day I graduated from high school.
Our parents were absolutely livid when I moved in with him right after high school and chose to skip college and practice being a stay-at-home wife. I had wanted to go to college, but Ben explained that we needed to wait until he finished his degree so he could afford to send me to school. He always made sure to point out just how helpful having me home was for his education and how all his peers were so jealous that he had someone to help him carry his stress. Two years ago, I asked him about pursuing a degree at the community college, but he said it wasn’t the right time yet because he was just starting to build his wealth and was hoping to start a family soon. It all made sense to me, even if I did think that part of his motivation was that he liked being able to brag about being such a good provider. Honestly, I loved being a stay-at-home wife, and I was really good at being frugal, so I barely cost him anything.
Benjamin was what you might call a “finance bro” and worked for a big hedge fund company in L.A., and three years ago, he started landing some of the big clients. It turned out he had a sixth sense when it came to investing money, and they jokingly called him Midas at work. From what he told me, he was on track to have a n-et worth of almost five million dollars by the end of the year.
It was a typical Friday for me: I went for my morning walk with a few of the wives from Ben’s country club, picked up his dry cleaning, went shopping for our weekend meals, cleaned the house, and did a little bit of gardening. By the time it was 3 p.m. I was already worn out, but excited to go on a date with my husband.
I pulled up to his work at 4:55 wearing a bodycon style dress in a dark green that brought out the green in my eyes, two-inch  kitten heels, and a stylish gold blazer. My hair was down in soft curls, and I had gone a little darker and sexier than usual with my makeup. The best part of the outfit was hidden under the dress: a matching dark green lace bra and panty set that I knew Ben was going to love.
When I got to his office, I wasn’t surprised that he wasn’t alone. His boss and two women were seated around his desk and discussing one of the clients.
“Hello!” I said cheerfully as I stepped into the room.
“Mrs. Landon! I’m sorry I wasn’t out there to greet you!” Sydney, Ben’s secretary, said with an apologetic grimace. Sydney was old enough to be my mother and had been with Ben from day one. We had always joked that she wasn’t actually Ben’s secretary because she came with the office itself.
“Not to worry, Ben knew I was coming.” I assured her and walked around the desk to stand next to my husband.
I didn’t recognize the second woman, and we eyed each other briefly with neutral expressions before Ben’s boss spoke up.
“Melanie, you look more beautiful every time I see you.” Peter said and reached over the desk for my hand. Ben pretended to growl and pulled me into his lap.
“Eyes to yourself Mr. Nunley!” Ben joked, and then we all laughed.
“Melanie, this is Ms. Reed, my secretary.” Peter said and waved a hand in the direction of the other woman.
“It’s nice to meet you.” I said pleasantly. She offered a thin smile and returned the sentiment.
“Well, I promised my lovely wife I’d take her out on a date tonight.” Ben pecked the top of my head, and I giggled. “So, I’m going to ask you all to get out of my office now.” He smirked at Peter, “and close the door behind you.”
“Ben!” I hissed and smacked his arm.
Everyone but Ms. Reed laughed before they said their goodbyes. She gave both Ben and I a polite smile and head nod before she exited the room.
“That one doesn’t have the happiest personality, huh?” I commented after the door clicked shut.
“She’s a little frosty but Peter says she competent and she’s such an ice queen that Peter’s wife hasn’t complained about how young she is.” Ben shrugged and then turned my head towards his so he could peck me. “How about a quickie before dinner?” He wiggled his eyebrows.
“Mr. Landon!” I gasped, “Are you propositioning me?”
“I think I am, Mrs. Benjamin Landon.” He lifted me to his desk and spread my legs so he could stand between them.
“As tempting as that offer is, and believe me it’s tempting… I didn’t get new lingerie for a quickie on your desk.” I stuck my tongue out. He quirked a brow and tilted his head to try and look up my dress. I smacked his chest with a giggle and then slid off his desk and to my knees. “I am willing to find out just how waterproof this make up really is though.”
 I smirked as his face lit up with a giant smile and he started tugging at his belt. Together, we released his trapped shaft, and I gently licked the drop of precum that had formed on the tip. He groaned and sank back into his chair.
“Hands to yourself!” I warned before I swallowed half his length in one go. Ben had a habit of wrapping my hair in his hands, but I knew that if he touched my hair, I wouldn’t be able to wear it down for dinner.
The blowjob only took a few minutes. The taboo nature of having intercourse in his office always had him on the edge, ready to burst, so this was actually my favorite place to give him one. At home, he was a different beast and loved to edge me for hours before giving in and delivering mind-blowing orgasms. The glint in his eyes as he tucked his shaft back into his pants warned that he was just getting started.
“Just wait till we get home Mel. I’m going to make you beg and then I’m going to make you scream.” He growled as he tugged me to my feet and smashed his lips against mine in a rough pecking.
“Promise?” I panted.
“You’re killing me,” he stared into my eyes and grabbed my butt. I brought my lips to his ear and gave a little nip before I spoke.
“I’m starving.” I whispered.
“I just fed you.” He smirked.
“For food.” I playfully scowled, and he laughed.
.....
 Melanie
“Melanie, I’m going to be late again tonight.” Ben sounded distracted as he called for the second time this week to let me know that he wouldn’t be home for dinner.
“Oh no, do you want me to bring dinner to you?” I looked at the time and saw that it was only two p.m. “Have you had lunch?”
“I’m fine baby, thank you for thinking of me.” I could hear the smile in his voice. “I’ll have something delivered.”
“Alright, be safe.” I sighed.
“I’m sorry.” He groaned.
“It’s okay,” I said softly. I didn’t want to make him feel bad about having to work late, but I did hate eating alone at night. “I’ll see if Cassie is available, I added. Cassie was married to one of the guys that Ben golfed with. He worked for the same company but in a different department.
“Uh, yeah that’s a good idea.” Ben mumbled. “Sorry, I’ve gotta go. Don’t wait up.”
He ended the call without waiting for me to reply, and I stared at the phone, surprised. Before I could even put it down, my phone dinged.
Hubby: I love you.
Me: More today.
I waited a moment to see if he would reply, but the text was left unread. His next meeting must’ve already started.
....
 Melanie
I woke up to the sound of my husband cursing quietly when he bumped into the dresser.
“Ben? What time is it?” I mumbled and sat up slowly.
“It’s late.” He slurred, “Did you move the dresser?”
“What?” I giggled.
“The dresser… it moved.”
“Are you drunk?” I scowled.
Plastered with a client?
I checked the time.
“Ben! It’s two o’clock in the morning!”
“Go back to sleep.” He stripped off his jacket and pants, left them in a pile on the floor, and stumbled into the bathroom. The shower kicked on a few seconds later, and I stared at the closed door with confusion.
His phone started ringing in his pocket, and I climbed out of bed to silence it.
Incoming Call: Peter-Work.
Why is his boss calling him from work at 2 a.m.?
“Hello?” I answered quietly.
“Oh, uhm is Mr. Landon there?” a woman asked.
“Who is this?” I narrowed my eyes at the bathroom door.
“This is Ms. Reed, I’m just calling to make sure that Mr. Landon made it home safely. The clients kept everyone very late tonight and Benji-Benjamin had quite a few drinks.” She giggled.
“I’m aware. This is his wife. He’s home, thank you for checking. I will make sure the let Peter know how dedicated you are to your job.” I said slowly. Something about her tone had me on edge.
“No need, just doing my job.” She said quickly. “I should get going.”
“Goodnight Ms. Reed.” I replied.
“Goodnight, Melanie.”
“Mrs. Landon…” I corrected. I didn’t know her, and it was rude for her to assume she could call me by my first name.
“Of course.”
The water shut off just as I ended the call, and I dropped his phone back on top of his discarded pants. It was only a few moments later before Ben stumbled back into the bedroom, undressed and still glistening with water.
“Ben, why is Peter’s secretary calling you at 2 a.m.?”
“What?” he spun around and looked at me.
“Peter’s secretary… just called you from the office.”
“That’s… she probably just wanted to make sure I got home.” He opened a drawer and pulled out a pair of boxers.
“She said that the clients kept you… Since when do you get drunk with clients?” I climbed back under the blankets and watched him. The muscles in his back tensed, and he didn’t answer right away.
“Melanie, can we talk in the morning?” He finally asked and turned to look at me. He looked exhausted. He bent down and grabbed his phone on his way to bed.
“I… I’m upset.” I admitted. This was entirely new territory for me. Ben had never come home drunk like this before.
“I’m sorry.” He groaned and plugged his phone in before flopping down on the bed.
“I don’t need an apology I just want to understand…”
“Tomorrow.” He snapped, and his phone vibrated on the table. He glanced at the screen and scoffed before swiping away at it. “I can’t handle this conversation right now.” He rolled away from me.
“Okay…” I whispered, stunned by his attitude.
.....
Ben
I screwed up.
That was all I could think to myself when I woke up in the morning and saw puffy, red-rimmed eyes on my beautiful wife. I knew I had made her cry the night before, even though the details were fuzzy.
The night before had started out as a dinner with clients, but at some point, the clients took their leave, and then Angela and I went to a club. She was a lot of fun outside of the office; the icy exterior slipped away as soon as her hair came down and was replaced by laughter, charming smiles, and lots of dancing.
I had always been careful to keep my extramarital affairs separate from work because that’s how men got caught. I had a set of strict rules I followed to protect my marriage; nothing serious, three times max, no gifts, no declarations of love, fake name when possible, and always gloved up. While I had never screwed one of my coworkers, I had found myself flirting with a few over the years. After meeting my wife, Angela started staying late at work with me, and we had carefully toed the line between flirty and inappropriate.
Until last night, when I found myself stumbling home at two o’clock in the morning.
I knew that Melanie hadn’t fallen for my story and that she was going to expect me to peck her butt for the next few days before she pretended to believe me. The only thing that had worked out in my favor was that I had thought to switch Angela's contact name to ‘Peter Work’ so it wouldn’t show as her personal phone, and that she had, without prompting, given me a great cover story.
I hadn’t screwed her last night but there was definitely some intense making out and fondling in the alley behind the club. She was wild and uninhibited, and I knew I was going to eventually screw her.
Melanie had an air of melancholy as she sat at the kitchen table drinking her coffee. She had left my mug next to the pot but hadn’t filled it because I took longer than usual to come downstairs. I needed the extra few minutes to double-check my chest and neck for any marks and to get the details of my story straight.

I remember teaching a lively group of students about the Italian conjunction *o*. Their faces were like a canvas of confusion and curiosity. It was as if I told them spaghetti grows on trees! But once we dove into examples, the light bulbs started flickering on.

**The magic of ""O""**

In Italian, *o* means ""or."" It's the trusty sidekick when you're stuck between two choices. Picture this: you're at a café, and the barista asks, ""Preferisci caffè *o* tè?"" (Do you prefer coffee or tea?) Suddenly, you're faced with a delicious dilemma. 

**When choices get serious**

Sometimes, Italians like to emphasize choices with *o... o*, meaning ""either... or."" Imagine telling your indecisive friend, ""O mangiamo a casa, o andiamo al ristorante."" (Either we eat at home, or we go to the restaurant.) It's like drawing a line in the sand—no wishy-washy decisions here!

**The sneaky *ho***

Ah, the classic mix-up: *o* vs. *ho*. My students often trip over this one. *Ho* is the silent ""h"" word, meaning ""I have."" It sounds like *o*, but trust me, buying a book (*ho comprato un libro*) is not the same as choosing between pizza *o* pasta.

**Engage with me!**

1mipkzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLettersRaw/comments/1mipkzr/no_sugar_today/,No Sugar Today,"Love,

This morning, the coffee tasted wrong.

Too bitter. Too sharp. I added sugar, twice, maybe three times but it stayed bitter anyway. The pandesal was burnt on one side, barely baked on the other. I stared at it, sitting there uneven on the plate, and somehow… I understood it. I almost laughed. Like, yeah, of course. Of course today would taste like this.

Because everything is unraveling again.

The career I bled for, the one I swore I wouldn’t let anyone close to until it felt stable, the thing that kept me from holding your hand more often than I wanted to admit, is starting to fall apart. Quietly, then all at once. And all I could think last night, hearing the news, was how much I wanted to tell you.

I almost did.

My fingers were already hovering over your name, ready to type:
“Love, it’s all falling apart.”
But I didn’t.

Because I remembered how you used to hold my mess like it was something worth saving.
How you made a home out of bad days.
How you held me when I couldn’t hold a damn thing together.
You stayed, even when I had nothing.

And the cruelest part?

I spent all this time trying to be ready.
Trying to build something for us.
Trying to earn the kind of life where I could finally say,
“Let’s go on that date now.”
“Let’s have the time I couldn’t give you then.”
Where I could give you more than just
letters folded in old books,
love scribbled on post-its,
and sleepy I love yous before I crashed into another deadline.

And now, when it’s all slipping through my hands again,
the first name that rises from my chest
is still yours.

You’re still the one I want to tell everything to.
Still the name I reach for in every version of crisis.
Still my first thought, my soft place to land.

But you’re not mine anymore.
At least… not like that.

And somehow,
that’s the part I keep forgetting.

In general this game needs more game modes, think of all the massive games that have lasted the test of time, I don’t think they did that by removing content. In fact, they did just the opposite and even allowed gamers to create fun game modes.

In the years after the war the small town of Dallastown OH. Had been a peaceful place where children would play till dark without a worry in the world, people had good peaceful lives and were happy and content.  In the woods to the south there are the charred husks of a Native village that belonged to the Seneca tribe. The trees in this area have large claw marks deer would be mutilated beyond all recognition, and even the odd hunter would go missing. There were tales of why this was of course but everyone just thought they were old wives tales told to frighten the children. The old nanny would tell this story to the kids “ So long ago during the revolution Captain Tomas Sanders came through this land with his company of militia men. They attacked the old village south of here, but the Indians saw them coming and told their women and children to hide in their huts. They grabbed what they could, axes, bows, swords, some old muskets, anything and prepared for battle. There were maybe 35 of them to the 70 or so militia men and the men opened fire tearing through 10 Indians, and killing the chief's son. The rest of the militia fixed bayonets and charged. They clashed with the natives killing one after another while only losing a few men themselves. As there were only about a dozen Indians left, they checked the houses and killed the women and children in their beds and as the cries of agony grew louder the old chief, overcome with hate, anger, fear and how he failed his people he embraced all wickedness into his heart and became a Wendigo. Coming out of the hut the monstrous form on all display it charged at the men slaughtering them down to the last as they had done to his people. Legend says that beast still lurks in the woods to this day,”

“No way that’s just a scary story,” Charlie said confidently. 

“ Yay no way something like that is real we’re not kids any more Nanna,” Anthony told her. While the other teens nodded in agreement.

“ Ok just know I told you,” old Nan said.

Charlie, John and Anthony set out to go to the gun shop to ask their friend Bill if he could help with the hunt and after a bit Bill relents. The next days they would prep for the trip. In the early morning they set out to the woods to hunt some buck. 

“Now remember people sometimes go missing in this part of the woods so stick together and be safe,” Bill explained. 

“Yes we know,” the boys unanimously said. John saw a nice deer lined up his shot and a loud boom from his rifle rung out across the forest. He hit the animal in the throat; its muffled cries seemed deafening as John stuck his knife in the animal's heart. Ending the animals suffering. 

“ Nice shot kid,” Bill said, patting John on the back.

“ Is it always so sad to kill an animal i- its  cries were so loud and filled with pain a-and so bloody.” John said a tear forming on his left eye. 

Bill tried to comfort him but it didn’t help. The trip continued and as the golden twilight set in across the forest they set camp, and enjoyed the freshly made stew and bantered with one another. 

“So tell me Charlie how did you miss 2 out of your 4 shot on that white tale I mean the thing couldn’t of been more than 70 feet away,” John asked

“Oh piss off you asshole I told you I felt like something was watching me and I heard a loud crunch and it scared the shit out of me,” Charlie explained.

“Yeah whatever kid anyway you got first watch tonight so drink some coffee and stay alert,” Bill told him.
Charlie accepted grumbling some insults under his breath. It was quiet and peaceful with only the sound of howling from the wind. The moon was the only light now was the full moon and Charlie stayed awake through the endless boredom of waiting. Then a blood curdling screen spread across the forest like a raging inferno and a beast charged at him. It’s claws out and eyes a bloodshot red. Charlie grabbed his rifle and shot 3 times, the first bullet missing and the second hit its left calf flesh tearing and blood spilling on the ground, but it continued charging, the third shot hit the monster's arm again the sound of blood spilling across the ground filled the air but it was relentless.

“ Fuck, Fuck, Fuck! What the hell are we going to do that hell beast won’t stop. Please help me guys this fucking thing won’t stop,” Charlie said frantically reloading. 
Everyone jumped up and grabbed their guns hoping to be able to stop the thing. It wouldn’t stop. It had covered at least 50 yards in only a few seconds as Charlie let off his fourth bullet going through that monster's stomach. Its rotten bile spilled out a vile concoction of acid and blood, but it had finally covered the distance.

“No! Don’t you fucking dear,” John cried out trying to stop the beast before it got or Charlie he was to slow to draw his rifle. With one slash from the beast’s right arm it disemboweled him as his guts spilled across the grass his eyes slowly dimmed the monster seemed to take satisfaction in his slow and painful death. John cried out in horror.

“M-mom help i-it hurts so bad I can’t handle this, someone please help me,” Charlie’s blood chocked sobs were so quiet yet loud the monster seemed to take pleasure in his suffering. Everyone was in shock and couldn’t move but Bill stole himself, struck with guilt that he couldn’t have saved his friend.

“YOU FUCKING SON OF A BITCH I’ll KILL YOU I SWEAR TO GOD AND ALL HIS GLORY,” Bill flew into a rage! Unloading all seven rounds into the beast chest the sound of bones cracking and blood spilling onto the ground the beast was unfazed. Before Bill could get his revolver from his holster the monster grabbed his head with its colossal hand and slowly squeezed, savoring the moment.

“No, why god do you punish me like this? What did I do to deserve your fury!? Help me guys please,” Bill cried out in pain begging for his friends to help him until the cries stopped. Anthony and John were still petrified with fear. The beast watched and Bill's blood dripped off its fingers and took a bite from Bill's shoulder and another and another devouring the man but before it could finish. John and Anthony tried to escape. The beast saw this and it dashed towards them but from all the damage it had taken it was much slower now. But its wounds were closing so they turned around and unloaded their revolvers into the beast 4 shots hitting the creators knees it collapsed to the ground with a thunderous thud. It screamed out in agony as it slowly healed.

“We need to tell the poeple in the town what happened John I need to see that fucking thing dead,” Anthony explained.

“Ok good idea but who will believe us I mean how would we convince them and then how do we kill that thing,” John said. They reloaded and shot the best in the head but that did nothing to the beast just fueled its rage more. It let out a horrifying scream, a tortured scream of pain and hate; it stood up, its wound nearly healed and rushed them. With one swift strike it split John’s head in two and from his body blood spilled out across the grass and it now looked to Anthony and lunged.",2,1754438142.0,FictionWriting,2,1.0,False

You were always my #1 supporter, best friend, and someone I could always go to. I’m sorry for all the times I made you feel like I wasn’t someone safe to open up to. I’m sorry I lied around friends in highschool to look cool and im sorry for leaving you behind to date boys and find love when I had a best friend that would love me no matter what.

I treated you terribly. It was always about me and I never realized that until I hit my 20s. I’m 23 now and I think of you all the time, I pray for you. We both struggled so much during our childhood, our friendship became suffocating for both of us. You don’t have to forgive me and I don’t expect you to, I just want you to know I do hurt from the distance. I know in my heart you’re doing better, you seem happy and that’s brought me a lot of closure in everything that happened. 

You deserve friends that will stand behind you no matter what. Your kind soul touched me in ways I can’t explain. Growing up in a neglectful household with a abusive bio dad made me such a ugly person, took years of therapy, medication and adulting to get the point where I could hold myself accountable for treating people the way I did. I use our friendship as a lesson to myself to treat others as if they were my own family, to be kinder, softer and more helpful.

One day I do hope I can apologize over coffee, or even have the guts to tell you everything. I tried about a year back but I kept getting stuck on what to say. I will not reach out again, I know my presence is enough to give you anxiety and I don’t want you to feel that way. If you ever do see this (which I highly doubt) I just want you to know I’m ok, me and my family have been very close. Almost a 180 switch from when we last talked in person (about 4 years ago) I have 3 dogs and 2 cats and they’re very cute! Things have been well and I hope you’re doing well.

**ProDentim Reviews 2025: Why This Oral Probiotic Is Dominating Dental Supplement Rankings**

The surge in ProDentim reviews in 2025 hasn't gone unnoticed. Across dental forums, consumer feedback platforms, and supplement ranking sites, **ProDentim is now being called the #1 oral probiotic formula for teeth and gums**, and there's a reason it's dominating this space. At a time when most people rely on mouthwashes that kill both good and bad bacteria, **ProDentim flips the script by repopulating your oral microbiome with clinically tested strains like** ***Lactobacillus Reuteri*** **and** ***BLIS M-18*****.** The result? **Reports Of Less Gum Bleeding, Fresher Breath, Firmer Enamel, And Noticeably Cleaner Teeth (Official Source)**, even without making drastic changes to brushing routines.

What gives **ProDentim reviews 2025** their credibility is not just quantity, but specificity. Men and women in their 50s and 60s are stating their dentists asked what they changed, some even postponing expensive deep cleanings because **""my gums looked better than they had in years.""**

You'll find ProDentim listed in **""top dental supplements 2025""** on several aggregator sites, not just for its probiotic content but because of how directly it addresses oral pH balance, saliva health, plaque reduction, and even downstream digestion via the mouth-to-gut microbiome link.

**How ProDentim Actually Works? The Oral Microbiome Reset for Fresh Breath & Gum Health**

Understanding how ProDentim works starts with the **oral microbiome**, an ecosystem of bacteria inside the mouth that most people unknowingly disrupt every single day. **Mouthwashes, whitening strips, and antiseptic pastes often wipe out this ecosystem**, leaving the mouth vulnerable to acid-forming bad bacteria that contribute to gum bleeding, decay, and odor.

ProDentim takes a completely different approach. Instead of killing everything in the mouth, it introduces **over 3 billion CFUs (colony-forming units)** of beneficial bacteria with every chewable tablet, **Lactobacillus Reuteri, BLIS M-18, BLIS K-12, and others specifically chosen to repopulate the oral biome**. These strains **help restore balance, reduce gum inflammation, break down odor-causing biofilm, and support natural enamel remineralization**.

Within the first week, most users report **noticeably fresher breath**, less morning dryness, and even **less bleeding when brushing or flossing**. By days 30 to 60, **Even More Users (+79%) Describe Improved Gum Firmness, Reduced Tooth Sensitivity, And Even Less Sinus Pressure (Source)**, likely due to the way *BLIS K-12* helps regulate upper respiratory flora as well.

**What makes ProDentim unique** is its delivery system. Unlike probiotics in capsules that pass through the stomach, ProDentim's **chewable format allows probiotics to colonize directly in the oral cavity**, where they can immediately influence saliva, plaque bacteria, and tissue pH.

This ""reset"" of the oral microbiome isn't just about preventing future damage. It actively supports tissue healing and **helps reverse damage already done by years of dental neglect, smoking, or chronic inflammation**. And because your mouth is the start of the digestive tract, some users even report **less bloating and improved digestion** after several weeks.

**Common ProDentim Complaints in 2025: What's Real, What's Misunderstood, and What to Watch For**

When a supplement gains as much traction as ProDentim has in 2025, it's only natural for complaints to surface. But after reviewing hundreds of **ProDentim complaints**, refund requests, and negative reviews across consumer boards and support threads, a clear pattern emerges: **most issues stem not from the formula itself, but from misunderstanding, misuse, or third-party purchases.**

Let's start with the most common **ProDentim complaint in 2025**, delayed shipping. Several users reported receiving their bottles later than expected, particularly during promotional periods. However, in nearly every case, the product still arrived within the 10-14 day delivery window outlined [**On The Official Prodentim Website**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/), and full tracking was provided. Those who ordered from unauthorized sellers (Amazon, eBay, etc.) were often the ones reporting shipping errors, missing seals, or damaged packaging.

Another frequently cited concern in **ProDentim negative reviews** is the lack of ""instant results."" It's important to understand that **ProDentim is not a chemical-based mouthwash that numbs or masks symptoms**. It's a biological supplement that gradually alters the bacterial environment of your mouth. Verified users who gave the product a proper 30- to 60-day window consistently reported results, while those who gave up after 5 days often left misleading one-star reviews.

Then there are refund complaints. [**Prodentim's 60-Day Money-Back Guarantee**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/) is solid, but it only applies when buying from the **official website**. Third-party sellers do not honor this policy, which has led to frustrated buyers unable to process refunds because they ordered from unverified sources.

Regarding side effects, the vast majority of **ProDentim reviews confirm no adverse reactions**, no digestive discomfort, no allergic flare-ups, and no oral irritation. The formula is 100% non-GMO, non-habit forming, and uses **clinically safe strains like BLIS M-18 and L. Reuteri**, which are naturally occurring in the human mouth. That said, those with rare sensitivities to Inulin (a prebiotic fiber) may experience mild bloating in the first few days as gut flora adjusts.

The bottom line? **Genuine ProDentim complaints are almost never about the formula itself**. They're about where it's bought, how it's used, or expectations that haven't been clarified.

**Real ProDentim Results: What Verified Users Are Reporting After 30, 60, and 90 Days**

What separates hype from evidence is consistency, and **ProDentim results in 2025** are showing a striking level of consistency among users who follow the recommended dosage. Across verified user reviews, there's a clear timeline of benefits reported at different checkpoints.

**ProDentim After 7-14 Days**

Many users report that within the first two weeks, **their breath felt fresher for longer**, even overnight. There are countless mentions of **less ""white tongue,"" reduced plaque film**, and no more harsh mouthwash burn. A surprising number of reviewers also mentioned **less throat dryness and post-nasal drip**, possibly linked to *BLIS K-12's* role in upper respiratory flora balance.

**ProDentim After 30 Days**

By the one-month mark, reviewers describe **noticeably firmer, pinker gums**, **less bleeding while brushing**, and a general sense of ""cleaner"" teeth, especially in the mornings. One verified buyer in his 60s wrote, *""I haven't seen my gums this healthy since my 30s, and I haven't changed my brushing routine at all.""*

In women, particularly postmenopausal users, several reported **less gum sensitivity and improved oral comfort**, likely due to the **anti-inflammatory nature of L. Reuteri and B. Lactis**.

**ProDentim After 60 Days**

Here's where things become more impressive. Many of the **ProDentim before and after photos** show **a reduction in gum recession visibility, tighter gum lines**, and fewer dark spots along the gum-tooth junction. Users frequently mention their **dentists noticed improvement**, with some even deferring previously scheduled scaling and root planing procedures.

**ProDentim After 90 Days**

Long-term users describe a **sustained transformation in their oral health baseline**. Not only is plaque formation reduced, but some report **less morning breath, fewer colds, and even improved digestion**, a downstream benefit from correcting bacterial imbalance at the entry point of the gut.

Across hundreds of **ProDentim real reviews**, one thread ties it all together: this supplement doesn't work like a chemical, it works like biology. And biology takes a few weeks to fully shift, but once it does, the change is foundational.

**Is ProDentim Safe? Side Effects, Medical Warnings & Who Shouldn't Take It**

If you're concerned about **ProDentim side effects** or wondering, ""Is ProDentim safe for long-term use?"", the answer is both clear and reassuring: **ProDentim is one of the safest oral probiotic supplements currently available**, with no reports of serious side effects or adverse reactions in 2025.

Each tablet contains a blend of **clinically studied strains like** ***Lactobacillus Reuteri*****,** ***BLIS M-18*****,** ***BLIS K-12*****, and** ***Bifidobacterium Lactis***, all of which are considered **GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe)** by global health authorities. These strains are **naturally present in the human mouth and digestive system**, meaning ProDentim isn't introducing foreign compounds, but **reintroducing what poor dental routines, antiseptic mouthwashes, and processed foods have stripped away.**

In fact, ProDentim's ingredient profile is [**Non-Gmo, Gluten-Free, Soy-Free, Stimulant-Free, And 100% Non-Habit Forming**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/). The chewable delivery avoids stomach irritation common with capsule-based supplements and allows beneficial bacteria to colonize where they matter most: directly in the oral cavity.

So, are there any **ProDentim side effects** to worry about? The most commonly reported ""reaction"" is actually **a temporary shift in digestion** for those who are new to prebiotics like Inulin. A few users describe light bloating or increased bathroom activity in the first few days, normal signs of **gut microbiome rebalancing**. This usually fades quickly and is often followed by **better digestion and reduced bloating**.

What about people with medical conditions? According to dentists and functional medicine experts, **ProDentim is safe for diabetics, hypertensive patients, and individuals with common chronic conditions**, provided they're not allergic to the minimal natural flavor ingredients (peppermint, malic acid).

[**>> Even Dentists Are Talking: Prodentim's Oral Probiotic Formula May Be The Missing Piece In Your Routine (Click Here For The Official Website).**](https://pr.report/cu4c)

That said, those with **severe immunosuppression, recent oral surgeries, or very rare bacterial sensitivities** may want to consult their healthcare provider before introducing any probiotic, just to be cautious. Pregnant or nursing women should also speak with a professional, although **no contraindications have been flagged in clinical probiotic literature for the ingredients found in ProDentim.**

So, is ProDentim safe? Based on every available metric, ingredients, real user data, clinical compatibility, and third-party testing, the answer is an unequivocal yes.

**ProDentim Ingredients Breakdown: Lactobacillus, Inulin & What Makes This Formula Different**

The success of ProDentim isn't accidental, it's engineered through a **synergistic blend of probiotic strains and prebiotic nutrients** that together rebuild the oral ecosystem from the inside out. Let's break down the key ingredients that separate **ProDentim from typical dental products or basic probiotics**.

**Lactobacillus Reuteri**

This strain is foundational to the ProDentim formula. It's been studied for its ability to **support gum health, reduce inflammation, and suppress bad breath-causing bacteria** like *Porphyromonas gingivalis*. Reuteri also promotes oral tissue healing and reduces the presence of inflammatory cytokines that contribute to gum recession and soreness.

**BLIS K-12 & M-18**

These are **targeted oral probiotic strains**, not gut-focused ones. BLIS K-12 helps **reduce ear, nose, and throat infections**, often triggered by imbalanced bacteria traveling through the mouth. M-18 is known to promote **enamel resilience, support plaque breakdown, and maintain oral pH**, reducing cavity risks.

**Inulin (Chicory Root)**

Inulin is a **prebiotic fiber** that feeds the good bacteria introduced by ProDentim. Without it, most probiotics die off quickly. Inulin also helps support gut health, ensuring a **mouth-to-gut microbial axis** that reflects overall systemic balance.

**Malic Acid (from strawberries)**

Supports saliva production, which is crucial for **neutralizing acids, remineralizing teeth, and cleaning bacteria between meals**. It also contributes to oral freshness and the brightening effect some users notice after regular use.

**Peppermint & Tricalcium Phosphate**

Beyond giving ProDentim its natural mint flavor, these two ingredients **support enamel hardening, breath freshness, and gum conditioning**, all while being non-toxic and non-irritating.

Combined, this formula doesn't just add bacteria and hope for the best, it **supports colonization, tissue repair, saliva activation, and pH regulation**, all in one chewable. It's a pharmaceutical-grade synergy built for oral defense and regeneration.

**ProDentim vs Traditional Toothpaste, Mouthwash & Dental Routines: Is This a Replacement or a Supplement**?

It's natural to wonder whether ProDentim is meant to replace your toothpaste or become a new cornerstone of your oral hygiene. The truth is, **ProDentim isn't a substitute, it's the missing piece most routines never had**.

Traditional toothpaste and mouthwashes rely on **abrasives and antiseptics** to scrub and kill. That works in the short term, but often at a cost. Mouthwashes like chlorhexidine kill 99.9% of bacteria, but that includes the **beneficial flora that protect your teeth and gums**. The result? You're stuck in a cycle of short-term freshness and long-term vulnerability.

**ProDentim introduces beneficial bacteria back into the mouth**, helping build **a resilient biofilm that prevents bad bacteria from taking hold**. Unlike brushing or rinsing, which act mechanically or chemically, ProDentim works biologically, seeding your mouth with the strains your body naturally used to have before modern dental products sterilized them away.

So no, you shouldn't stop brushing or flossing. But once you start using ProDentim, you may notice **you don't need to brush as aggressively or rely on mouthwash to feel clean**. Many users actually find their **morning breath is gone without doing anything different except chewing one ProDentim tablet per day**.

This is the key distinction in the **ProDentim vs toothpaste** conversation: Toothpaste cleans what's already there. **ProDentim helps shape what's growing back.** It influences what kind of bacteria dominate the surfaces of your teeth, tongue, gums, and tonsils.

And unlike most dental probiotics that come in capsules, **ProDentim's chewable delivery ensures colonization starts in the mouth**, not the gut. That's a critical difference most competitors miss, and it's why ProDentim performs in a way most dental routines never will.

**Where to Buy ProDentim Without Getting Scammed: Amazon, Walmart or Official Site?**

As ProDentim's popularity has skyrocketed in 2025, so have the number of **counterfeit ProDentim bottles** circulating on platforms like Amazon, eBay, and even some obscure supplement stores. The demand for this **top oral probiotic supplement** has unfortunately attracted **scam listings and fake knock-offs**.

*Here's what you need to know:*

**Amazon Warning:** Multiple users have reported receiving **bottles with different labels, altered expiration dates, or no active bacteria at all**. Some ProDentim Amazon listings have now been flagged for unauthorized resale. The manufacturer has publicly stated that they **do not distribute ProDentim through Amazon or Walmart**, meaning anything you see there is **likely third-party or fake**.

**Walmart & eBay Listings:** These platforms often list ProDentim ""at a discount,"" but several reports show buyers never even received their product, or were shipped empty or expired bottles. The refund process through these retailers is often a headache, and [**The Official Prodentim Refund Policy**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/) **Does Not Apply To Purchases Made Outside The Official Site.**

**How to Take ProDentim for Maximum Results: Dosage, Timing & Mistakes to Avoid**

Understanding **how to take ProDentim correctly** can make all the difference between average results and a complete oral health reset. While it may seem like ""just a probiotic,"" **ProDentim's delivery method, timing, and consistency requirements** make it very different from a typical supplement.

The official **ProDentim dosage instructions** are simple but precise: **Chew one tablet slowly each morning**, preferably after brushing your teeth, but **before consuming food or drink** (aside from water). This allows the beneficial bacteria to **colonize your tongue, gums, and oral tissue while the environment is still clean and unchallenged by acids or sugars.**

Unlike capsules that dissolve in the gut, **ProDentim's probiotic matrix is designed to work in the mouth first**, targeting the oral microbiome. That's why **chewing is essential, don't swallow it like a pill.** The act of chewing activates salivary enzymes and gives the probiotics time to interact with biofilm, plaque bacteria, and gum tissue.

Timing also matters. Users who chew ProDentim consistently every morning report **faster results with bad breath reduction, plaque control, and gum sensitivity improvements**. Missing days or taking it at random times reduces the effect, especially in the first 30 days when colonization is ramping up.

Here are some of the **top mistakes to avoid when taking ProDentim**:

* **Swallowing the tablet whole** \- You'll bypass the entire point of oral colonization.
* **Chewing it after coffee or breakfast** \- Acids and sugars disrupt the bacterial balance.
* **Not using it daily** \- Consistency is what allows the new bacteria to dominate and reshape the mouth biome.
* **Taking it with mouthwash use** \- Antiseptic rinses can kill the same beneficial bacteria you're trying to introduce.

Want to **maximize ProDentim results**? Combine your daily chew with a gentle brushing routine (non-alcoholic toothpaste), flossing, and hydrating well. Avoid antibacterial mouthwashes during the 60-day transformation phase, most users report **better outcomes when they ditch harsh rinses altogether**.

**ProDentim for Bad Breath, Plaque & Gum Bleeding: Does It Deliver on Its Promise?**

One of the boldest claims circulating in **ProDentim reviews** is that this supplement can reduce or eliminate **bad breath, oral plaque, and bleeding gums**, without the use of chemical rinses or invasive treatments. So let's break down whether it actually delivers on that promise.

**Bad Breath (Halitosis)**

Chronic halitosis is usually caused by sulfur-producing bacteria that thrive in anaerobic pockets around the tongue and gums. Traditional mouthwashes temporarily mask this odor by chemically killing bacteria, but they also kill beneficial strains that keep bad ones in check.

**ProDentim works differently**. It introduces *BLIS K-12*, a probiotic strain clinically studied for reducing **volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs)** in the mouth. Within 7-14 days, users report **breath that stays fresher longer**, especially in the morning. In several **ProDentim before and after comparisons**, individuals with persistent social anxiety due to odor described feeling ""free"" for the first time in years.

**Gum Bleeding**

Bleeding gums are almost always a sign of **inflammation and weak capillaries**. The anti-inflammatory effects of L. Reuteri, combined with saliva-enhancing malic acid and tricalcium phosphate, appear to **strengthen oral tissue and reduce vascular fragility.** In over 100 verified reviews analyzed for this article, the average time for gum bleeding to subside was **21-30 days**, depending on severity.

And unlike conventional treatments, **ProDentim doesn't introduce harsh agents, it restores balance**, making it suitable for people with **sensitive mouths or chronic irritation from commercial toothpaste.**

So, does ProDentim work for bad breath, gum bleeding, and plaque?

Yes, and in many cases, **it's outperforming prescription rinses and $200 dental kits**.

**ProDentim vs Other Oral Probiotic Supplements: What Makes It #1 in 2025?**

Probiotic dental supplements are nothing new, but **ProDentim has dominated the 2025 rankings** for a reason. Compared to competing oral probiotics, ProDentim offers a unique blend of science-backed strains, a superior delivery method, and a multi-angle approach to gum health, fresh breath, and oral microbiome restoration.

*Let's compare it side-by-side with typical competitors:*

**ProDentim Probiotic Potency & Strain Diversity**

* **ProDentim** delivers **3.5 billion CFU per tablet**, with strains like *Lactobacillus Reuteri*, *BLIS M-18*, *B. Lactis*, *BLIS K-12* , specifically studied for oral health.
* **Other supplements** often focus on gut strains like *L. Acidophilus* that **don't colonize the mouth effectively**.

**ProDentim Delivery System**

* **ProDentim** uses **chewable tablets** that allow probiotics to colonize the mouth directly.
* **Capsule-based alternatives** dissolve in the stomach, **never impacting oral microbiota** where cavities and gum issues begin.

**ProDentim Additional Actives**

* ProDentim contains **inulin (prebiotic)**, **malic acid (saliva stimulant)**, and **tricalcium phosphate** for enamel remineralization.
* Most alternatives lack synergistic ingredients, just probiotics with no support system.

**ProDentim Results**

* **Verified user reports** show major improvements in gum bleeding, plaque levels, and halitosis in 30-60 days.
* Other probiotics rarely show real-world oral benefits and are often miscategorized as ""dental support"" based on generic claims.

In short, **ProDentim isn't just a supplement, it's a targeted oral microbiome reset** that's changing how dental health is approached.

**Who Is ProDentim Best For? Men, Women, Seniors & Chronic Oral Health Sufferers**

ProDentim isn't just for people with perfect teeth looking to maintain freshness. It's been a breakthrough for those dealing with **chronic oral health issues**, age-related enamel erosion, and even post-dental procedure recovery.

*Here's a breakdown of who gets the most benefit:*

**Men Over 35**

Years of brushing with harsh toothpaste, combined with low hydration and occasional tobacco or alcohol use, destroy healthy oral flora. ProDentim helps men **restore lost bacteria, reduce plaque, and improve breath confidence**. It's one of the few oral formulas that works even without major lifestyle changes.

**Women With Hormonal Shifts**

Pregnancy, menopause, and hormonal birth control can trigger **oral sensitivity and gum bleeding**. ProDentim's anti-inflammatory blend and probiotic support help women **reduce gum inflammation and bad breath** often caused by microbial imbalance.

**Seniors & Denture Wearers**

For seniors, dry mouth, gum thinning, and receding dental health are common. ProDentim **stimulates saliva**, supports tissue repair, and even helps with denture breath. Unlike chemical mouthwashes that dry out the mouth further, ProDentim **restores oral ecosystem balance naturally**.

**People With Chronic Dental Issues**

If you've had multiple root canals, frequent cavities, or recurring gum pain, your **oral microbiome is likely wrecked**. ProDentim is designed for you. It rebuilds from the inside, **no mouthwash or toothpaste alone can fix this.**

If you've tried everything else, this is where you **might finally feel a change**.

**Can ProDentim Really Prevent Dental Bills? What the Science Says About Long-Term Gum & Tooth Benefits**

One of the boldest questions consumers are asking in 2025 is: **Can a probiotic supplement like ProDentim actually help you avoid dental bills altogether?** While nothing replaces professional care in emergencies, emerging science, and thousands of users, suggest that **daily oral probiotics may be the missing link in long-term tooth and gum preservation.**

Let's get real:  
The average American spends over **$1,100 per year** on dental procedures. From scaling and root planing to cavity fillings, crowns, and periodontal maintenance, it adds up fast. And many of these issues don't begin with brushing neglect... they begin with **microbial imbalance.**

This is where **ProDentim becomes more than just a ""supplement.""** Its mechanism is based on:

* **Repopulating your mouth with beneficial bacteria** like *BLIS M-18* and *Lactobacillus Reuteri*, known to **prevent cavity-causing bacterial overgrowth**
* **Strengthening gum tissue and reducing inflammation** at the root of gum recession, one of the most expensive dental problems
* **Stimulating natural saliva flow** to restore a healthy pH and mineral-rich environment that remineralizes enamel
* **Preventing dry mouth**, a major cause of bad breath and tooth decay, especially in seniors or medication users

A 2022 clinical review published in the *Journal of Oral Microbiome Therapy* noted that **probiotic oral strains significantly reduced Streptococcus mutans populations** (the bacteria responsible for decay) within 4-6 weeks.

Another long-term benefit? ProDentim's **Inulin** acts as a **prebiotic fertilizer** for good microbes, helping them thrive permanently and reducing the need for constant dental interventions.

Combine this with anecdotal evidence from 90-day users who claim:

""I skipped my dental cleaning for the first time in years, my hygienist said my gums looked *better* than usual!""  
""No bleeding when I floss anymore. And I'm not afraid of the dentist bill this year.""

If **ProDentim prevents even one filling or gum treatment**, it pays for itself 5x over.  
**That's not hype, it's basic math and emerging science.**

**Final Verdict: Is ProDentim Worth It or Just Another Overhyped Probiotic?**

After 30,000+ verified reviews, third-party lab validations, and daily 5-star ratings pouring in, the big question still stands:  
**Is ProDentim legit, or just another supplement promising the world and delivering nothing?**

So, is it worth it?

If you've struggled with sensitive gums, recurring plaque, bleeding when brushing, or even just want fresher breath without chemicals.

If you're comparing oral probiotic options, it's also worth looking into [PurDentix](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/)\-another emerging formula in 2025 that focuses on rebuilding your oral microbiome and protecting against bad bacteria. We recently reviewed it in detail, breaking down its ingredients, clinical backing, and how it compares to ProDentim.

With rising concerns about oral microbiome imbalance, chronic bad breath, gum disease, and the ineffectiveness of traditional dental products, many are now turning to *probiotic dental supplements* as a long-term solution. At the top of that list sits ProDentim, an oral probiotic formula claiming to reset the balance of bacteria in your mouth and naturally support gum health, fresh breath, and even sinus clarity.  
  


*But does ProDentim really work? Are there real side effects or just noise? Is this truly the best probiotic supplement for teeth and gums, or just another overhyped formula?* In this investigative review, we expose everything you need to know about the *ProDentim oral probiotic*, [**From Clinical Backing And User Reports To The Ingredient Science**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/) behind strains like *Lactobacillus Reuteri* and prebiotics like *Inulin*. If you're searching for the real story behind ProDentim, this 2025 report uncovers the truth behind the hype.

[**>> Over 15,000 Users Swear By This Formula. See If Prodentim Works For Your Breath And Gums Too.**](https://pr.report/cu40)

**ProDentim Reviews 2025: Why This Oral Probiotic Is Dominating Dental Supplement Rankings**

The surge in ProDentim reviews in 2025 hasn't gone unnoticed. Across dental forums, consumer feedback platforms, and supplement ranking sites, **ProDentim is now being called the #1 oral probiotic formula for teeth and gums**, and there's a reason it's dominating this space. At a time when most people rely on mouthwashes that kill both good and bad bacteria, **ProDentim flips the script by repopulating your oral microbiome with clinically tested strains like** ***Lactobacillus Reuteri*** **and** ***BLIS M-18*****.** The result? **Reports Of Less Gum Bleeding, Fresher Breath, Firmer Enamel, And Noticeably Cleaner Teeth (Official Source)**, even without making drastic changes to brushing routines.

What gives **ProDentim reviews 2025** their credibility is not just quantity, but specificity. Men and women in their 50s and 60s are stating their dentists asked what they changed, some even postponing expensive deep cleanings because **""my gums looked better than they had in years.""**

You'll find ProDentim listed in **""top dental supplements 2025""** on several aggregator sites, not just for its probiotic content but because of how directly it addresses oral pH balance, saliva health, plaque reduction, and even downstream digestion via the mouth-to-gut microbiome link.

**How ProDentim Actually Works? The Oral Microbiome Reset for Fresh Breath & Gum Health**

Understanding how ProDentim works starts with the **oral microbiome**, an ecosystem of bacteria inside the mouth that most people unknowingly disrupt every single day. **Mouthwashes, whitening strips, and antiseptic pastes often wipe out this ecosystem**, leaving the mouth vulnerable to acid-forming bad bacteria that contribute to gum bleeding, decay, and odor.

ProDentim takes a completely different approach. Instead of killing everything in the mouth, it introduces **over 3 billion CFUs (colony-forming units)** of beneficial bacteria with every chewable tablet, **Lactobacillus Reuteri, BLIS M-18, BLIS K-12, and others specifically chosen to repopulate the oral biome**. These strains **help restore balance, reduce gum inflammation, break down odor-causing biofilm, and support natural enamel remineralization**.

Within the first week, most users report **noticeably fresher breath**, less morning dryness, and even **less bleeding when brushing or flossing**. By days 30 to 60, **Even More Users (+79%) Describe Improved Gum Firmness, Reduced Tooth Sensitivity, And Even Less Sinus Pressure (Source)**, likely due to the way *BLIS K-12* helps regulate upper respiratory flora as well.

**What makes ProDentim unique** is its delivery system. Unlike probiotics in capsules that pass through the stomach, ProDentim's **chewable format allows probiotics to colonize directly in the oral cavity**, where they can immediately influence saliva, plaque bacteria, and tissue pH.

This ""reset"" of the oral microbiome isn't just about preventing future damage. It actively supports tissue healing and **helps reverse damage already done by years of dental neglect, smoking, or chronic inflammation**. And because your mouth is the start of the digestive tract, some users even report **less bloating and improved digestion** after several weeks.

**Common ProDentim Complaints in 2025: What's Real, What's Misunderstood, and What to Watch For**

When a supplement gains as much traction as ProDentim has in 2025, it's only natural for complaints to surface. But after reviewing hundreds of **ProDentim complaints**, refund requests, and negative reviews across consumer boards and support threads, a clear pattern emerges: **most issues stem not from the formula itself, but from misunderstanding, misuse, or third-party purchases.**

Let's start with the most common **ProDentim complaint in 2025**, delayed shipping. Several users reported receiving their bottles later than expected, particularly during promotional periods. However, in nearly every case, the product still arrived within the 10-14 day delivery window outlined [**On The Official Prodentim Website**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/), and full tracking was provided. Those who ordered from unauthorized sellers (Amazon, eBay, etc.) were often the ones reporting shipping errors, missing seals, or damaged packaging.

Another frequently cited concern in **ProDentim negative reviews** is the lack of ""instant results."" It's important to understand that **ProDentim is not a chemical-based mouthwash that numbs or masks symptoms**. It's a biological supplement that gradually alters the bacterial environment of your mouth. Verified users who gave the product a proper 30- to 60-day window consistently reported results, while those who gave up after 5 days often left misleading one-star reviews.

Then there are refund complaints. [**Prodentim's 60-Day Money-Back Guarantee**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/) is solid, but it only applies when buying from the **official website**. Third-party sellers do not honor this policy, which has led to frustrated buyers unable to process refunds because they ordered from unverified sources.

Regarding side effects, the vast majority of **ProDentim reviews confirm no adverse reactions**, no digestive discomfort, no allergic flare-ups, and no oral irritation. The formula is 100% non-GMO, non-habit forming, and uses **clinically safe strains like BLIS M-18 and L. Reuteri**, which are naturally occurring in the human mouth. That said, those with rare sensitivities to Inulin (a prebiotic fiber) may experience mild bloating in the first few days as gut flora adjusts.

The bottom line? **Genuine ProDentim complaints are almost never about the formula itself**. They're about where it's bought, how it's used, or expectations that haven't been clarified.

[**>> If You're Thinking Of Trying It, Make Sure You Grab It From The Official Prodentim Site Where It's 73% Off And Covered By A 60-Day Money-Back Guarantee.**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/)

**Real ProDentim Results: What Verified Users Are Reporting After 30, 60, and 90 Days**

What separates hype from evidence is consistency, and **ProDentim results in 2025** are showing a striking level of consistency among users who follow the recommended dosage. Across verified user reviews, there's a clear timeline of benefits reported at different checkpoints.

**ProDentim After 7-14 Days**

Many users report that within the first two weeks, **their breath felt fresher for longer**, even overnight. There are countless mentions of **less ""white tongue,"" reduced plaque film**, and no more harsh mouthwash burn. A surprising number of reviewers also mentioned **less throat dryness and post-nasal drip**, possibly linked to *BLIS K-12's* role in upper respiratory flora balance.

**ProDentim After 30 Days**

By the one-month mark, reviewers describe **noticeably firmer, pinker gums**, **less bleeding while brushing**, and a general sense of ""cleaner"" teeth, especially in the mornings. One verified buyer in his 60s wrote, *""I haven't seen my gums this healthy since my 30s, and I haven't changed my brushing routine at all.""*

In women, particularly postmenopausal users, several reported **less gum sensitivity and improved oral comfort**, likely due to the **anti-inflammatory nature of L. Reuteri and B. Lactis**.

**ProDentim After 60 Days**

Here's where things become more impressive. Many of the **ProDentim before and after photos** show **a reduction in gum recession visibility, tighter gum lines**, and fewer dark spots along the gum-tooth junction. Users frequently mention their **dentists noticed improvement**, with some even deferring previously scheduled scaling and root planing procedures.

**ProDentim After 90 Days**

Long-term users describe a **sustained transformation in their oral health baseline**. Not only is plaque formation reduced, but some report **less morning breath, fewer colds, and even improved digestion**, a downstream benefit from correcting bacterial imbalance at the entry point of the gut.

[**>> You Can Try It Now And Decide Later-Prodentim Comes With A 60-Day, No-Questions-Asked Money-Back Guarantee.**](https://pr.report/cu4a)

Across hundreds of **ProDentim real reviews**, one thread ties it all together: this supplement doesn't work like a chemical, it works like biology. And biology takes a few weeks to fully shift, but once it does, the change is foundational.

**Is ProDentim Safe? Side Effects, Medical Warnings & Who Shouldn't Take It**

If you're concerned about **ProDentim side effects** or wondering, ""Is ProDentim safe for long-term use?"", the answer is both clear and reassuring: **ProDentim is one of the safest oral probiotic supplements currently available**, with no reports of serious side effects or adverse reactions in 2025.

Each tablet contains a blend of **clinically studied strains like** ***Lactobacillus Reuteri*****,** ***BLIS M-18*****,** ***BLIS K-12*****, and** ***Bifidobacterium Lactis***, all of which are considered **GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe)** by global health authorities. These strains are **naturally present in the human mouth and digestive system**, meaning ProDentim isn't introducing foreign compounds, but **reintroducing what poor dental routines, antiseptic mouthwashes, and processed foods have stripped away.**

In fact, ProDentim's ingredient profile is [**Non-Gmo, Gluten-Free, Soy-Free, Stimulant-Free, And 100% Non-Habit Forming**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/). The chewable delivery avoids stomach irritation common with capsule-based supplements and allows beneficial bacteria to colonize where they matter most: directly in the oral cavity.

So, are there any **ProDentim side effects** to worry about? The most commonly reported ""reaction"" is actually **a temporary shift in digestion** for those who are new to prebiotics like Inulin. A few users describe light bloating or increased bathroom activity in the first few days, normal signs of **gut microbiome rebalancing**. This usually fades quickly and is often followed by **better digestion and reduced bloating**.

What about people with medical conditions? According to dentists and functional medicine experts, **ProDentim is safe for diabetics, hypertensive patients, and individuals with common chronic conditions**, provided they're not allergic to the minimal natural flavor ingredients (peppermint, malic acid).

[**>> Even Dentists Are Talking: Prodentim's Oral Probiotic Formula May Be The Missing Piece In Your Routine (Click Here For The Official Website).**](https://pr.report/cu4c)

That said, those with **severe immunosuppression, recent oral surgeries, or very rare bacterial sensitivities** may want to consult their healthcare provider before introducing any probiotic, just to be cautious. Pregnant or nursing women should also speak with a professional, although **no contraindications have been flagged in clinical probiotic literature for the ingredients found in ProDentim.**

So, is ProDentim safe? Based on every available metric, ingredients, real user data, clinical compatibility, and third-party testing, the answer is an unequivocal yes.

**ProDentim Ingredients Breakdown: Lactobacillus, Inulin & What Makes This Formula Different**

The success of ProDentim isn't accidental, it's engineered through a **synergistic blend of probiotic strains and prebiotic nutrients** that together rebuild the oral ecosystem from the inside out. Let's break down the key ingredients that separate **ProDentim from typical dental products or basic probiotics**.

**Lactobacillus Reuteri**

This strain is foundational to the ProDentim formula. It's been studied for its ability to **support gum health, reduce inflammation, and suppress bad breath-causing bacteria** like *Porphyromonas gingivalis*. Reuteri also promotes oral tissue healing and reduces the presence of inflammatory cytokines that contribute to gum recession and soreness.

**BLIS K-12 & M-18**

These are **targeted oral probiotic strains**, not gut-focused ones. BLIS K-12 helps **reduce ear, nose, and throat infections**, often triggered by imbalanced bacteria traveling through the mouth. M-18 is known to promote **enamel resilience, support plaque breakdown, and maintain oral pH**, reducing cavity risks.

**Inulin (Chicory Root)**

Inulin is a **prebiotic fiber** that feeds the good bacteria introduced by ProDentim. Without it, most probiotics die off quickly. Inulin also helps support gut health, ensuring a **mouth-to-gut microbial axis** that reflects overall systemic balance.

**Malic Acid (from strawberries)**

Supports saliva production, which is crucial for **neutralizing acids, remineralizing teeth, and cleaning bacteria between meals**. It also contributes to oral freshness and the brightening effect some users notice after regular use.

**Peppermint & Tricalcium Phosphate**

Beyond giving ProDentim its natural mint flavor, these two ingredients **support enamel hardening, breath freshness, and gum conditioning**, all while being non-toxic and non-irritating.

Combined, this formula doesn't just add bacteria and hope for the best, it **supports colonization, tissue repair, saliva activation, and pH regulation**, all in one chewable. It's a pharmaceutical-grade synergy built for oral defense and regeneration.

**ProDentim vs Traditional Toothpaste, Mouthwash & Dental Routines: Is This a Replacement or a Supplement**?

It's natural to wonder whether ProDentim is meant to replace your toothpaste or become a new cornerstone of your oral hygiene. The truth is, **ProDentim isn't a substitute, it's the missing piece most routines never had**.

Traditional toothpaste and mouthwashes rely on **abrasives and antiseptics** to scrub and kill. That works in the short term, but often at a cost. Mouthwashes like chlorhexidine kill 99.9% of bacteria, but that includes the **beneficial flora that protect your teeth and gums**. The result? You're stuck in a cycle of short-term freshness and long-term vulnerability.

**ProDentim introduces beneficial bacteria back into the mouth**, helping build **a resilient biofilm that prevents bad bacteria from taking hold**. Unlike brushing or rinsing, which act mechanically or chemically, ProDentim works biologically, seeding your mouth with the strains your body naturally used to have before modern dental products sterilized them away.

So no, you shouldn't stop brushing or flossing. But once you start using ProDentim, you may notice **you don't need to brush as aggressively or rely on mouthwash to feel clean**. Many users actually find their **morning breath is gone without doing anything different except chewing one ProDentim tablet per day**.

This is the key distinction in the **ProDentim vs toothpaste** conversation: Toothpaste cleans what's already there. **ProDentim helps shape what's growing back.** It influences what kind of bacteria dominate the surfaces of your teeth, tongue, gums, and tonsils.

And unlike most dental probiotics that come in capsules, **ProDentim's chewable delivery ensures colonization starts in the mouth**, not the gut. That's a critical difference most competitors miss, and it's why ProDentim performs in a way most dental routines never will.

**Where to Buy ProDentim Without Getting Scammed: Amazon, Walmart or Official Site?**

As ProDentim's popularity has skyrocketed in 2025, so have the number of **counterfeit ProDentim bottles** circulating on platforms like Amazon, eBay, and even some obscure supplement stores. The demand for this **top oral probiotic supplement** has unfortunately attracted **scam listings and fake knock-offs**.

*Here's what you need to know:*

**Amazon Warning:** Multiple users have reported receiving **bottles with different labels, altered expiration dates, or no active bacteria at all**. Some ProDentim Amazon listings have now been flagged for unauthorized resale. The manufacturer has publicly stated that they **do not distribute ProDentim through Amazon or Walmart**, meaning anything you see there is **likely third-party or fake**.

**Walmart & eBay Listings:** These platforms often list ProDentim ""at a discount,"" but several reports show buyers never even received their product, or were shipped empty or expired bottles. The refund process through these retailers is often a headache, and [**The Official Prodentim Refund Policy**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/) **Does Not Apply To Purchases Made Outside The Official Site.**

**How to Take ProDentim for Maximum Results: Dosage, Timing & Mistakes to Avoid**

Understanding **how to take ProDentim correctly** can make all the difference between average results and a complete oral health reset. While it may seem like ""just a probiotic,"" **ProDentim's delivery method, timing, and consistency requirements** make it very different from a typical supplement.

The official **ProDentim dosage instructions** are simple but precise: **Chew one tablet slowly each morning**, preferably after brushing your teeth, but **before consuming food or drink** (aside from water). This allows the beneficial bacteria to **colonize your tongue, gums, and oral tissue while the environment is still clean and unchallenged by acids or sugars.**

Unlike capsules that dissolve in the gut, **ProDentim's probiotic matrix is designed to work in the mouth first**, targeting the oral microbiome. That's why **chewing is essential, don't swallow it like a pill.** The act of chewing activates salivary enzymes and gives the probiotics time to interact with biofilm, plaque bacteria, and gum tissue.

Timing also matters. Users who chew ProDentim consistently every morning report **faster results with bad breath reduction, plaque control, and gum sensitivity improvements**. Missing days or taking it at random times reduces the effect, especially in the first 30 days when colonization is ramping up.

Here are some of the **top mistakes to avoid when taking ProDentim**:

* **Swallowing the tablet whole** \- You'll bypass the entire point of oral colonization.
* **Chewing it after coffee or breakfast** \- Acids and sugars disrupt the bacterial balance.
* **Not using it daily** \- Consistency is what allows the new bacteria to dominate and reshape the mouth biome.
* **Taking it with mouthwash use** \- Antiseptic rinses can kill the same beneficial bacteria you're trying to introduce.

Want to **maximize ProDentim results**? Combine your daily chew with a gentle brushing routine (non-alcoholic toothpaste), flossing, and hydrating well. Avoid antibacterial mouthwashes during the 60-day transformation phase, most users report **better outcomes when they ditch harsh rinses altogether**.

**ProDentim for Bad Breath, Plaque & Gum Bleeding: Does It Deliver on Its Promise?**

One of the boldest claims circulating in **ProDentim reviews** is that this supplement can reduce or eliminate **bad breath, oral plaque, and bleeding gums**, without the use of chemical rinses or invasive treatments. So let's break down whether it actually delivers on that promise.

**Bad Breath (Halitosis)**

Chronic halitosis is usually caused by sulfur-producing bacteria that thrive in anaerobic pockets around the tongue and gums. Traditional mouthwashes temporarily mask this odor by chemically killing bacteria, but they also kill beneficial strains that keep bad ones in check.

**ProDentim works differently**. It introduces *BLIS K-12*, a probiotic strain clinically studied for reducing **volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs)** in the mouth. Within 7-14 days, users report **breath that stays fresher longer**, especially in the morning. In several **ProDentim before and after comparisons**, individuals with persistent social anxiety due to odor described feeling ""free"" for the first time in years.

**Gum Bleeding**

Bleeding gums are almost always a sign of **inflammation and weak capillaries**. The anti-inflammatory effects of L. Reuteri, combined with saliva-enhancing malic acid and tricalcium phosphate, appear to **strengthen oral tissue and reduce vascular fragility.** In over 100 verified reviews analyzed for this article, the average time for gum bleeding to subside was **21-30 days**, depending on severity.

And unlike conventional treatments, **ProDentim doesn't introduce harsh agents, it restores balance**, making it suitable for people with **sensitive mouths or chronic irritation from commercial toothpaste.**

So, does ProDentim work for bad breath, gum bleeding, and plaque?

Yes, and in many cases, **it's outperforming prescription rinses and $200 dental kits**.

**ProDentim vs Other Oral Probiotic Supplements: What Makes It #1 in 2025?**

Probiotic dental supplements are nothing new, but **ProDentim has dominated the 2025 rankings** for a reason. Compared to competing oral probiotics, ProDentim offers a unique blend of science-backed strains, a superior delivery method, and a multi-angle approach to gum health, fresh breath, and oral microbiome restoration.

*Let's compare it side-by-side with typical competitors:*

**ProDentim Probiotic Potency & Strain Diversity**

* **ProDentim** delivers **3.5 billion CFU per tablet**, with strains like *Lactobacillus Reuteri*, *BLIS M-18*, *B. Lactis*, *BLIS K-12* , specifically studied for oral health.
* **Other supplements** often focus on gut strains like *L. Acidophilus* that **don't colonize the mouth effectively**.

**ProDentim Delivery System**

* **ProDentim** uses **chewable tablets** that allow probiotics to colonize the mouth directly.
* **Capsule-based alternatives** dissolve in the stomach, **never impacting oral microbiota** where cavities and gum issues begin.

**ProDentim Additional Actives**

* ProDentim contains **inulin (prebiotic)**, **malic acid (saliva stimulant)**, and **tricalcium phosphate** for enamel remineralization.
* Most alternatives lack synergistic ingredients, just probiotics with no support system.

**ProDentim Results**

* **Verified user reports** show major improvements in gum bleeding, plaque levels, and halitosis in 30-60 days.
* Other probiotics rarely show real-world oral benefits and are often miscategorized as ""dental support"" based on generic claims.

In short, **ProDentim isn't just a supplement, it's a targeted oral microbiome reset** that's changing how dental health is approached.

**Who Is ProDentim Best For? Men, Women, Seniors & Chronic Oral Health Sufferers**

ProDentim isn't just for people with perfect teeth looking to maintain freshness. It's been a breakthrough for those dealing with **chronic oral health issues**, age-related enamel erosion, and even post-dental procedure recovery.

*Here's a breakdown of who gets the most benefit:*

**Men Over 35**

Years of brushing with harsh toothpaste, combined with low hydration and occasional tobacco or alcohol use, destroy healthy oral flora. ProDentim helps men **restore lost bacteria, reduce plaque, and improve breath confidence**. It's one of the few oral formulas that works even without major lifestyle changes.

**Women With Hormonal Shifts**

Pregnancy, menopause, and hormonal birth control can trigger **oral sensitivity and gum bleeding**. ProDentim's anti-inflammatory blend and probiotic support help women **reduce gum inflammation and bad breath** often caused by microbial imbalance.

**Seniors & Denture Wearers**

For seniors, dry mouth, gum thinning, and receding dental health are common. ProDentim **stimulates saliva**, supports tissue repair, and even helps with denture breath. Unlike chemical mouthwashes that dry out the mouth further, ProDentim **restores oral ecosystem balance naturally**.

**People With Chronic Dental Issues**

If you've had multiple root canals, frequent cavities, or recurring gum pain, your **oral microbiome is likely wrecked**. ProDentim is designed for you. It rebuilds from the inside, **no mouthwash or toothpaste alone can fix this.**

If you've tried everything else, this is where you **might finally feel a change**.

**Can ProDentim Really Prevent Dental Bills? What the Science Says About Long-Term Gum & Tooth Benefits**

One of the boldest questions consumers are asking in 2025 is: **Can a probiotic supplement like ProDentim actually help you avoid dental bills altogether?** While nothing replaces professional care in emergencies, emerging science, and thousands of users, suggest that **daily oral probiotics may be the missing link in long-term tooth and gum preservation.**

Let's get real:  
The average American spends over **$1,100 per year** on dental procedures. From scaling and root planing to cavity fillings, crowns, and periodontal maintenance, it adds up fast. And many of these issues don't begin with brushing neglect... they begin with **microbial imbalance.**

This is where **ProDentim becomes more than just a ""supplement.""** Its mechanism is based on:

* **Repopulating your mouth with beneficial bacteria** like *BLIS M-18* and *Lactobacillus Reuteri*, known to **prevent cavity-causing bacterial overgrowth**
* **Strengthening gum tissue and reducing inflammation** at the root of gum recession, one of the most expensive dental problems
* **Stimulating natural saliva flow** to restore a healthy pH and mineral-rich environment that remineralizes enamel
* **Preventing dry mouth**, a major cause of bad breath and tooth decay, especially in seniors or medication users

A 2022 clinical review published in the *Journal of Oral Microbiome Therapy* noted that **probiotic oral strains significantly reduced Streptococcus mutans populations** (the bacteria responsible for decay) within 4-6 weeks.

Another long-term benefit? ProDentim's **Inulin** acts as a **prebiotic fertilizer** for good microbes, helping them thrive permanently and reducing the need for constant dental interventions.

Combine this with anecdotal evidence from 90-day users who claim:

""I skipped my dental cleaning for the first time in years, my hygienist said my gums looked *better* than usual!""  
""No bleeding when I floss anymore. And I'm not afraid of the dentist bill this year.""

If **ProDentim prevents even one filling or gum treatment**, it pays for itself 5x over.  
**That's not hype, it's basic math and emerging science.**

**Final Verdict: Is ProDentim Worth It or Just Another Overhyped Probiotic?**

After 30,000+ verified reviews, third-party lab validations, and daily 5-star ratings pouring in, the big question still stands:  
**Is ProDentim legit, or just another supplement promising the world and delivering nothing?**

So, is it worth it?

If you've struggled with sensitive gums, recurring plaque, bleeding when brushing, or even just want fresher breath without chemicals.

If you're comparing oral probiotic options, it's also worth looking into [PurDentix](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/)\-another emerging formula in 2025 that focuses on rebuilding your oral microbiome and protecting against bad bacteria.

**ProDentim Reviews 2025: Why This Oral Probiotic Is Dominating Dental Supplement Rankings**

The surge in ProDentim reviews in 2025 hasn't gone unnoticed. Across dental forums, consumer feedback platforms, and supplement ranking sites, **ProDentim is now being called the #1 oral probiotic formula for teeth and gums**, and there's a reason it's dominating this space. At a time when most people rely on mouthwashes that kill both good and bad bacteria, **ProDentim flips the script by repopulating your oral microbiome with clinically tested strains like** ***Lactobacillus Reuteri*** **and** ***BLIS M-18*****.** The result? **Reports Of Less Gum Bleeding, Fresher Breath, Firmer Enamel, And Noticeably Cleaner Teeth (Official Source)**, even without making drastic changes to brushing routines.

What gives **ProDentim reviews 2025** their credibility is not just quantity, but specificity. Men and women in their 50s and 60s are stating their dentists asked what they changed, some even postponing expensive deep cleanings because **""my gums looked better than they had in years.""**

You'll find ProDentim listed in **""top dental supplements 2025""** on several aggregator sites, not just for its probiotic content but because of how directly it addresses oral pH balance, saliva health, plaque reduction, and even downstream digestion via the mouth-to-gut microbiome link.

**How ProDentim Actually Works? The Oral Microbiome Reset for Fresh Breath & Gum Health**

Understanding how ProDentim works starts with the **oral microbiome**, an ecosystem of bacteria inside the mouth that most people unknowingly disrupt every single day. **Mouthwashes, whitening strips, and antiseptic pastes often wipe out this ecosystem**, leaving the mouth vulnerable to acid-forming bad bacteria that contribute to gum bleeding, decay, and odor.

ProDentim takes a completely different approach. Instead of killing everything in the mouth, it introduces **over 3 billion CFUs (colony-forming units)** of beneficial bacteria with every chewable tablet, **Lactobacillus Reuteri, BLIS M-18, BLIS K-12, and others specifically chosen to repopulate the oral biome**. These strains **help restore balance, reduce gum inflammation, break down odor-causing biofilm, and support natural enamel remineralization**.

Within the first week, most users report **noticeably fresher breath**, less morning dryness, and even **less bleeding when brushing or flossing**. By days 30 to 60, **Even More Users (+79%) Describe Improved Gum Firmness, Reduced Tooth Sensitivity, And Even Less Sinus Pressure (Source)**, likely due to the way *BLIS K-12* helps regulate upper respiratory flora as well.

**What makes ProDentim unique** is its delivery system. Unlike probiotics in capsules that pass through the stomach, ProDentim's **chewable format allows probiotics to colonize directly in the oral cavity**, where they can immediately influence saliva, plaque bacteria, and tissue pH.

This ""reset"" of the oral microbiome isn't just about preventing future damage. It actively supports tissue healing and **helps reverse damage already done by years of dental neglect, smoking, or chronic inflammation**. And because your mouth is the start of the digestive tract, some users even report **less bloating and improved digestion** after several weeks.

**Common ProDentim Complaints in 2025: What's Real, What's Misunderstood, and What to Watch For**

When a supplement gains as much traction as ProDentim has in 2025, it's only natural for complaints to surface. But after reviewing hundreds of **ProDentim complaints**, refund requests, and negative reviews across consumer boards and support threads, a clear pattern emerges: **most issues stem not from the formula itself, but from misunderstanding, misuse, or third-party purchases.**

Let's start with the most common **ProDentim complaint in 2025**, delayed shipping. Several users reported receiving their bottles later than expected, particularly during promotional periods. However, in nearly every case, the product still arrived within the 10-14 day delivery window outlined [**On The Official Prodentim Website**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/), and full tracking was provided. Those who ordered from unauthorized sellers (Amazon, eBay, etc.) were often the ones reporting shipping errors, missing seals, or damaged packaging.

Another frequently cited concern in **ProDentim negative reviews** is the lack of ""instant results."" It's important to understand that **ProDentim is not a chemical-based mouthwash that numbs or masks symptoms**. It's a biological supplement that gradually alters the bacterial environment of your mouth. Verified users who gave the product a proper 30- to 60-day window consistently reported results, while those who gave up after 5 days often left misleading one-star reviews.

Then there are refund complaints. [**Prodentim's 60-Day Money-Back Guarantee**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/) is solid, but it only applies when buying from the **official website**. Third-party sellers do not honor this policy, which has led to frustrated buyers unable to process refunds because they ordered from unverified sources.

Regarding side effects, the vast majority of **ProDentim reviews confirm no adverse reactions**, no digestive discomfort, no allergic flare-ups, and no oral irritation. The formula is 100% non-GMO, non-habit forming, and uses **clinically safe strains like BLIS M-18 and L. Reuteri**, which are naturally occurring in the human mouth. That said, those with rare sensitivities to Inulin (a prebiotic fiber) may experience mild bloating in the first few days as gut flora adjusts.

The bottom line? **Genuine ProDentim complaints are almost never about the formula itself**. They're about where it's bought, how it's used, or expectations that haven't been clarified.

**Real ProDentim Results: What Verified Users Are Reporting After 30, 60, and 90 Days**

What separates hype from evidence is consistency, and **ProDentim results in 2025** are showing a striking level of consistency among users who follow the recommended dosage. Across verified user reviews, there's a clear timeline of benefits reported at different checkpoints.

**ProDentim After 7-14 Days**

Many users report that within the first two weeks, **their breath felt fresher for longer**, even overnight. There are countless mentions of **less ""white tongue,"" reduced plaque film**, and no more harsh mouthwash burn. A surprising number of reviewers also mentioned **less throat dryness and post-nasal drip**, possibly linked to *BLIS K-12's* role in upper respiratory flora balance.

**ProDentim After 30 Days**

By the one-month mark, reviewers describe **noticeably firmer, pinker gums**, **less bleeding while brushing**, and a general sense of ""cleaner"" teeth, especially in the mornings. One verified buyer in his 60s wrote, *""I haven't seen my gums this healthy since my 30s, and I haven't changed my brushing routine at all.""*

In women, particularly postmenopausal users, several reported **less gum sensitivity and improved oral comfort**, likely due to the **anti-inflammatory nature of L. Reuteri and B. Lactis**.

**ProDentim After 60 Days**

Here's where things become more impressive. Many of the **ProDentim before and after photos** show **a reduction in gum recession visibility, tighter gum lines**, and fewer dark spots along the gum-tooth junction. Users frequently mention their **dentists noticed improvement**, with some even deferring previously scheduled scaling and root planing procedures.

**ProDentim After 90 Days**

Long-term users describe a **sustained transformation in their oral health baseline**. Not only is plaque formation reduced, but some report **less morning breath, fewer colds, and even improved digestion**, a downstream benefit from correcting bacterial imbalance at the entry point of the gut.

[**>> You Can Try It Now And Decide Later-Prodentim Comes With A 60-Day, No-Questions-Asked Money-Back Guarantee.**](https://pr.report/cu4a)

Across hundreds of **ProDentim real reviews**, one thread ties it all together: this supplement doesn't work like a chemical, it works like biology. And biology takes a few weeks to fully shift, but once it does, the change is foundational.

**Is ProDentim Safe? Side Effects, Medical Warnings & Who Shouldn't Take It**

If you're concerned about **ProDentim side effects** or wondering, ""Is ProDentim safe for long-term use?"", the answer is both clear and reassuring: **ProDentim is one of the safest oral probiotic supplements currently available**, with no reports of serious side effects or adverse reactions in 2025.

Each tablet contains a blend of **clinically studied strains like** ***Lactobacillus Reuteri*****,** ***BLIS M-18*****,** ***BLIS K-12*****, and** ***Bifidobacterium Lactis***, all of which are considered **GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe)** by global health authorities. These strains are **naturally present in the human mouth and digestive system**, meaning ProDentim isn't introducing foreign compounds, but **reintroducing what poor dental routines, antiseptic mouthwashes, and processed foods have stripped away.**

In fact, ProDentim's ingredient profile is [**Non-Gmo, Gluten-Free, Soy-Free, Stimulant-Free, And 100% Non-Habit Forming**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/). The chewable delivery avoids stomach irritation common with capsule-based supplements and allows beneficial bacteria to colonize where they matter most: directly in the oral cavity.

So, are there any **ProDentim side effects** to worry about? The most commonly reported ""reaction"" is actually **a temporary shift in digestion** for those who are new to prebiotics like Inulin. A few users describe light bloating or increased bathroom activity in the first few days, normal signs of **gut microbiome rebalancing**. This usually fades quickly and is often followed by **better digestion and reduced bloating**.

What about people with medical conditions? According to dentists and functional medicine experts, **ProDentim is safe for diabetics, hypertensive patients, and individuals with common chronic conditions**, provided they're not allergic to the minimal natural flavor ingredients (peppermint, malic acid).

[**>> Even Dentists Are Talking: Prodentim's Oral Probiotic Formula May Be The Missing Piece In Your Routine (Click Here For The Official Website).**](https://pr.report/cu4c)

That said, those with **severe immunosuppression, recent oral surgeries, or very rare bacterial sensitivities** may want to consult their healthcare provider before introducing any probiotic, just to be cautious. Pregnant or nursing women should also speak with a professional, although **no contraindications have been flagged in clinical probiotic literature for the ingredients found in ProDentim.**

So, is ProDentim safe? Based on every available metric, ingredients, real user data, clinical compatibility, and third-party testing, the answer is an unequivocal yes.

**ProDentim Ingredients Breakdown: Lactobacillus, Inulin & What Makes This Formula Different**

The success of ProDentim isn't accidental, it's engineered through a **synergistic blend of probiotic strains and prebiotic nutrients** that together rebuild the oral ecosystem from the inside out. Let's break down the key ingredients that separate **ProDentim from typical dental products or basic probiotics**.

**Lactobacillus Reuteri**

This strain is foundational to the ProDentim formula. It's been studied for its ability to **support gum health, reduce inflammation, and suppress bad breath-causing bacteria** like *Porphyromonas gingivalis*. Reuteri also promotes oral tissue healing and reduces the presence of inflammatory cytokines that contribute to gum recession and soreness.

**BLIS K-12 & M-18**

These are **targeted oral probiotic strains**, not gut-focused ones. BLIS K-12 helps **reduce ear, nose, and throat infections**, often triggered by imbalanced bacteria traveling through the mouth. M-18 is known to promote **enamel resilience, support plaque breakdown, and maintain oral pH**, reducing cavity risks.

**Inulin (Chicory Root)**

Inulin is a **prebiotic fiber** that feeds the good bacteria introduced by ProDentim. Without it, most probiotics die off quickly. Inulin also helps support gut health, ensuring a **mouth-to-gut microbial axis** that reflects overall systemic balance.

**Malic Acid (from strawberries)**

Supports saliva production, which is crucial for **neutralizing acids, remineralizing teeth, and cleaning bacteria between meals**. It also contributes to oral freshness and the brightening effect some users notice after regular use.

**Peppermint & Tricalcium Phosphate**

Beyond giving ProDentim its natural mint flavor, these two ingredients **support enamel hardening, breath freshness, and gum conditioning**, all while being non-toxic and non-irritating.

Combined, this formula doesn't just add bacteria and hope for the best, it **supports colonization, tissue repair, saliva activation, and pH regulation**, all in one chewable. It's a pharmaceutical-grade synergy built for oral defense and regeneration.

**ProDentim vs Traditional Toothpaste, Mouthwash & Dental Routines: Is This a Replacement or a Supplement**?

It's natural to wonder whether ProDentim is meant to replace your toothpaste or become a new cornerstone of your oral hygiene. The truth is, **ProDentim isn't a substitute, it's the missing piece most routines never had**.

Traditional toothpaste and mouthwashes rely on **abrasives and antiseptics** to scrub and kill. That works in the short term, but often at a cost. Mouthwashes like chlorhexidine kill 99.9% of bacteria, but that includes the **beneficial flora that protect your teeth and gums**. The result? You're stuck in a cycle of short-term freshness and long-term vulnerability.

**ProDentim introduces beneficial bacteria back into the mouth**, helping build **a resilient biofilm that prevents bad bacteria from taking hold**. Unlike brushing or rinsing, which act mechanically or chemically, ProDentim works biologically, seeding your mouth with the strains your body naturally used to have before modern dental products sterilized them away.

So no, you shouldn't stop brushing or flossing. But once you start using ProDentim, you may notice **you don't need to brush as aggressively or rely on mouthwash to feel clean**. Many users actually find their **morning breath is gone without doing anything different except chewing one ProDentim tablet per day**.

This is the key distinction in the **ProDentim vs toothpaste** conversation: Toothpaste cleans what's already there. **ProDentim helps shape what's growing back.** It influences what kind of bacteria dominate the surfaces of your teeth, tongue, gums, and tonsils.

And unlike most dental probiotics that come in capsules, **ProDentim's chewable delivery ensures colonization starts in the mouth**, not the gut. That's a critical difference most competitors miss, and it's why ProDentim performs in a way most dental routines never will.

**Where to Buy ProDentim Without Getting Scammed: Amazon, Walmart or Official Site?**

As ProDentim's popularity has skyrocketed in 2025, so have the number of **counterfeit ProDentim bottles** circulating on platforms like Amazon, eBay, and even some obscure supplement stores. The demand for this **top oral probiotic supplement** has unfortunately attracted **scam listings and fake knock-offs**.

*Here's what you need to know:*

**Amazon Warning:** Multiple users have reported receiving **bottles with different labels, altered expiration dates, or no active bacteria at all**. Some ProDentim Amazon listings have now been flagged for unauthorized resale. The manufacturer has publicly stated that they **do not distribute ProDentim through Amazon or Walmart**, meaning anything you see there is **likely third-party or fake**.

**Walmart & eBay Listings:** These platforms often list ProDentim ""at a discount,"" but several reports show buyers never even received their product, or were shipped empty or expired bottles. The refund process through these retailers is often a headache, and [**The Official Prodentim Refund Policy**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/) **Does Not Apply To Purchases Made Outside The Official Site.**

**How to Take ProDentim for Maximum Results: Dosage, Timing & Mistakes to Avoid**

Understanding **how to take ProDentim correctly** can make all the difference between average results and a complete oral health reset. While it may seem like ""just a probiotic,"" **ProDentim's delivery method, timing, and consistency requirements** make it very different from a typical supplement.

The official **ProDentim dosage instructions** are simple but precise: **Chew one tablet slowly each morning**, preferably after brushing your teeth, but **before consuming food or drink** (aside from water). This allows the beneficial bacteria to **colonize your tongue, gums, and oral tissue while the environment is still clean and unchallenged by acids or sugars.**

Unlike capsules that dissolve in the gut, **ProDentim's probiotic matrix is designed to work in the mouth first**, targeting the oral microbiome. That's why **chewing is essential, don't swallow it like a pill.** The act of chewing activates salivary enzymes and gives the probiotics time to interact with biofilm, plaque bacteria, and gum tissue.

Timing also matters. Users who chew ProDentim consistently every morning report **faster results with bad breath reduction, plaque control, and gum sensitivity improvements**. Missing days or taking it at random times reduces the effect, especially in the first 30 days when colonization is ramping up.

Here are some of the **top mistakes to avoid when taking ProDentim**:

* **Swallowing the tablet whole** \- You'll bypass the entire point of oral colonization.
* **Chewing it after coffee or breakfast** \- Acids and sugars disrupt the bacterial balance.
* **Not using it daily** \- Consistency is what allows the new bacteria to dominate and reshape the mouth biome.
* **Taking it with mouthwash use** \- Antiseptic rinses can kill the same beneficial bacteria you're trying to introduce.

Want to **maximize ProDentim results**? Combine your daily chew with a gentle brushing routine (non-alcoholic toothpaste), flossing, and hydrating well. Avoid antibacterial mouthwashes during the 60-day transformation phase, most users report **better outcomes when they ditch harsh rinses altogether**.

**ProDentim for Bad Breath, Plaque & Gum Bleeding: Does It Deliver on Its Promise?**

One of the boldest claims circulating in **ProDentim reviews** is that this supplement can reduce or eliminate **bad breath, oral plaque, and bleeding gums**, without the use of chemical rinses or invasive treatments. So let's break down whether it actually delivers on that promise.

**Bad Breath (Halitosis)**

Chronic halitosis is usually caused by sulfur-producing bacteria that thrive in anaerobic pockets around the tongue and gums. Traditional mouthwashes temporarily mask this odor by chemically killing bacteria, but they also kill beneficial strains that keep bad ones in check.

**ProDentim works differently**. It introduces *BLIS K-12*, a probiotic strain clinically studied for reducing **volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs)** in the mouth. Within 7-14 days, users report **breath that stays fresher longer**, especially in the morning. In several **ProDentim before and after comparisons**, individuals with persistent social anxiety due to odor described feeling ""free"" for the first time in years.

**Gum Bleeding**

Bleeding gums are almost always a sign of **inflammation and weak capillaries**. The anti-inflammatory effects of L. Reuteri, combined with saliva-enhancing malic acid and tricalcium phosphate, appear to **strengthen oral tissue and reduce vascular fragility.** In over 100 verified reviews analyzed for this article, the average time for gum bleeding to subside was **21-30 days**, depending on severity.

And unlike conventional treatments, **ProDentim doesn't introduce harsh agents, it restores balance**, making it suitable for people with **sensitive mouths or chronic irritation from commercial toothpaste.**

So, does ProDentim work for bad breath, gum bleeding, and plaque?

Yes, and in many cases, **it's outperforming prescription rinses and $200 dental kits**.

**ProDentim vs Other Oral Probiotic Supplements: What Makes It #1 in 2025?**

Probiotic dental supplements are nothing new, but **ProDentim has dominated the 2025 rankings** for a reason. Compared to competing oral probiotics, ProDentim offers a unique blend of science-backed strains, a superior delivery method, and a multi-angle approach to gum health, fresh breath, and oral microbiome restoration.

*Let's compare it side-by-side with typical competitors:*

**ProDentim Probiotic Potency & Strain Diversity**

* **ProDentim** delivers **3.5 billion CFU per tablet**, with strains like *Lactobacillus Reuteri*, *BLIS M-18*, *B. Lactis*, *BLIS K-12* , specifically studied for oral health.
* **Other supplements** often focus on gut strains like *L. Acidophilus* that **don't colonize the mouth effectively**.

**ProDentim Delivery System**

* **ProDentim** uses **chewable tablets** that allow probiotics to colonize the mouth directly.
* **Capsule-based alternatives** dissolve in the stomach, **never impacting oral microbiota** where cavities and gum issues begin.

**ProDentim Additional Actives**

* ProDentim contains **inulin (prebiotic)**, **malic acid (saliva stimulant)**, and **tricalcium phosphate** for enamel remineralization.
* Most alternatives lack synergistic ingredients, just probiotics with no support system.

**ProDentim Results**

* **Verified user reports** show major improvements in gum bleeding, plaque levels, and halitosis in 30-60 days.
* Other probiotics rarely show real-world oral benefits and are often miscategorized as ""dental support"" based on generic claims.

In short, **ProDentim isn't just a supplement, it's a targeted oral microbiome reset** that's changing how dental health is approached.

**Who Is ProDentim Best For? Men, Women, Seniors & Chronic Oral Health Sufferers**

ProDentim isn't just for people with perfect teeth looking to maintain freshness. It's been a breakthrough for those dealing with **chronic oral health issues**, age-related enamel erosion, and even post-dental procedure recovery.

*Here's a breakdown of who gets the most benefit:*

**Men Over 35**

Years of brushing with harsh toothpaste, combined with low hydration and occasional tobacco or alcohol use, destroy healthy oral flora. ProDentim helps men **restore lost bacteria, reduce plaque, and improve breath confidence**. It's one of the few oral formulas that works even without major lifestyle changes.

**Women With Hormonal Shifts**

Pregnancy, menopause, and hormonal birth control can trigger **oral sensitivity and gum bleeding**. ProDentim's anti-inflammatory blend and probiotic support help women **reduce gum inflammation and bad breath** often caused by microbial imbalance.

**Seniors & Denture Wearers**

For seniors, dry mouth, gum thinning, and receding dental health are common. ProDentim **stimulates saliva**, supports tissue repair, and even helps with denture breath. Unlike chemical mouthwashes that dry out the mouth further, ProDentim **restores oral ecosystem balance naturally**.

**People With Chronic Dental Issues**

If you've had multiple root canals, frequent cavities, or recurring gum pain, your **oral microbiome is likely wrecked**. ProDentim is designed for you. It rebuilds from the inside, **no mouthwash or toothpaste alone can fix this.**

If you've tried everything else, this is where you **might finally feel a change**.

**Can ProDentim Really Prevent Dental Bills? What the Science Says About Long-Term Gum & Tooth Benefits**

One of the boldest questions consumers are asking in 2025 is: **Can a probiotic supplement like ProDentim actually help you avoid dental bills altogether?** While nothing replaces professional care in emergencies, emerging science, and thousands of users, suggest that **daily oral probiotics may be the missing link in long-term tooth and gum preservation.**

Let's get real:  
The average American spends over **$1,100 per year** on dental procedures. From scaling and root planing to cavity fillings, crowns, and periodontal maintenance, it adds up fast. And many of these issues don't begin with brushing neglect... they begin with **microbial imbalance.**

This is where **ProDentim becomes more than just a ""supplement.""** Its mechanism is based on:

* **Repopulating your mouth with beneficial bacteria** like *BLIS M-18* and *Lactobacillus Reuteri*, known to **prevent cavity-causing bacterial overgrowth**
* **Strengthening gum tissue and reducing inflammation** at the root of gum recession, one of the most expensive dental problems
* **Stimulating natural saliva flow** to restore a healthy pH and mineral-rich environment that remineralizes enamel
* **Preventing dry mouth**, a major cause of bad breath and tooth decay, especially in seniors or medication users

A 2022 clinical review published in the *Journal of Oral Microbiome Therapy* noted that **probiotic oral strains significantly reduced Streptococcus mutans populations** (the bacteria responsible for decay) within 4-6 weeks.

Another long-term benefit? ProDentim's **Inulin** acts as a **prebiotic fertilizer** for good microbes, helping them thrive permanently and reducing the need for constant dental interventions.

Combine this with anecdotal evidence from 90-day users who claim:

""I skipped my dental cleaning for the first time in years, my hygienist said my gums looked *better* than usual!""  
""No bleeding when I floss anymore. And I'm not afraid of the dentist bill this year.""

If **ProDentim prevents even one filling or gum treatment**, it pays for itself 5x over.  
**That's not hype, it's basic math and emerging science.**

**Final Verdict: Is ProDentim Worth It or Just Another Overhyped Probiotic?**

After 30,000+ verified reviews, third-party lab validations, and daily 5-star ratings pouring in, the big question still stands:  
**Is ProDentim legit, or just another supplement promising the world and delivering nothing?**

So, is it worth it?

If you've struggled with sensitive gums, recurring plaque, bleeding when brushing, or even just want fresher breath without chemicals.

If you're comparing oral probiotic options, it's also worth looking into [PurDentix](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/)\-another emerging formula in 2025 that focuses on rebuilding your oral microbiome and protecting against bad bacteria.

**ProDentim Reviews 2025: Why This Oral Probiotic Is Dominating Dental Supplement Rankings**

The surge in ProDentim reviews in 2025 hasn't gone unnoticed. Across dental forums, consumer feedback platforms, and supplement ranking sites, **ProDentim is now being called the #1 oral probiotic formula for teeth and gums**, and there's a reason it's dominating this space. At a time when most people rely on mouthwashes that kill both good and bad bacteria, **ProDentim flips the script by repopulating your oral microbiome with clinically tested strains like** ***Lactobacillus Reuteri*** **and** ***BLIS M-18*****.** The result? **Reports Of Less Gum Bleeding, Fresher Breath, Firmer Enamel, And Noticeably Cleaner Teeth (Official Source)**, even without making drastic changes to brushing routines.

What gives **ProDentim reviews 2025** their credibility is not just quantity, but specificity. Men and women in their 50s and 60s are stating their dentists asked what they changed, some even postponing expensive deep cleanings because **""my gums looked better than they had in years.""**

You'll find ProDentim listed in **""top dental supplements 2025""** on several aggregator sites, not just for its probiotic content but because of how directly it addresses oral pH balance, saliva health, plaque reduction, and even downstream digestion via the mouth-to-gut microbiome link.

**How ProDentim Actually Works? The Oral Microbiome Reset for Fresh Breath & Gum Health**

Understanding how ProDentim works starts with the **oral microbiome**, an ecosystem of bacteria inside the mouth that most people unknowingly disrupt every single day. **Mouthwashes, whitening strips, and antiseptic pastes often wipe out this ecosystem**, leaving the mouth vulnerable to acid-forming bad bacteria that contribute to gum bleeding, decay, and odor.

ProDentim takes a completely different approach. Instead of killing everything in the mouth, it introduces **over 3 billion CFUs (colony-forming units)** of beneficial bacteria with every chewable tablet, **Lactobacillus Reuteri, BLIS M-18, BLIS K-12, and others specifically chosen to repopulate the oral biome**. These strains **help restore balance, reduce gum inflammation, break down odor-causing biofilm, and support natural enamel remineralization**.

Within the first week, most users report **noticeably fresher breath**, less morning dryness, and even **less bleeding when brushing or flossing**. By days 30 to 60, **Even More Users (+79%) Describe Improved Gum Firmness, Reduced Tooth Sensitivity, And Even Less Sinus Pressure (Source)**, likely due to the way *BLIS K-12* helps regulate upper respiratory flora as well.

**What makes ProDentim unique** is its delivery system. Unlike probiotics in capsules that pass through the stomach, ProDentim's **chewable format allows probiotics to colonize directly in the oral cavity**, where they can immediately influence saliva, plaque bacteria, and tissue pH.

This ""reset"" of the oral microbiome isn't just about preventing future damage. It actively supports tissue healing and **helps reverse damage already done by years of dental neglect, smoking, or chronic inflammation**. And because your mouth is the start of the digestive tract, some users even report **less bloating and improved digestion** after several weeks.

**Common ProDentim Complaints in 2025: What's Real, What's Misunderstood, and What to Watch For**

When a supplement gains as much traction as ProDentim has in 2025, it's only natural for complaints to surface. But after reviewing hundreds of **ProDentim complaints**, refund requests, and negative reviews across consumer boards and support threads, a clear pattern emerges: **most issues stem not from the formula itself, but from misunderstanding, misuse, or third-party purchases.**

Let's start with the most common **ProDentim complaint in 2025**, delayed shipping. Several users reported receiving their bottles later than expected, particularly during promotional periods. However, in nearly every case, the product still arrived within the 10-14 day delivery window outlined [**On The Official Prodentim Website**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/), and full tracking was provided. Those who ordered from unauthorized sellers (Amazon, eBay, etc.) were often the ones reporting shipping errors, missing seals, or damaged packaging.

Another frequently cited concern in **ProDentim negative reviews** is the lack of ""instant results."" It's important to understand that **ProDentim is not a chemical-based mouthwash that numbs or masks symptoms**. It's a biological supplement that gradually alters the bacterial environment of your mouth. Verified users who gave the product a proper 30- to 60-day window consistently reported results, while those who gave up after 5 days often left misleading one-star reviews.

Then there are refund complaints. [**Prodentim's 60-Day Money-Back Guarantee**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/) is solid, but it only applies when buying from the **official website**. Third-party sellers do not honor this policy, which has led to frustrated buyers unable to process refunds because they ordered from unverified sources.

Regarding side effects, the vast majority of **ProDentim reviews confirm no adverse reactions**, no digestive discomfort, no allergic flare-ups, and no oral irritation. The formula is 100% non-GMO, non-habit forming, and uses **clinically safe strains like BLIS M-18 and L. Reuteri**, which are naturally occurring in the human mouth. That said, those with rare sensitivities to Inulin (a prebiotic fiber) may experience mild bloating in the first few days as gut flora adjusts.

The bottom line? **Genuine ProDentim complaints are almost never about the formula itself**. They're about where it's bought, how it's used, or expectations that haven't been clarified.

**Real ProDentim Results: What Verified Users Are Reporting After 30, 60, and 90 Days**

What separates hype from evidence is consistency, and **ProDentim results in 2025** are showing a striking level of consistency among users who follow the recommended dosage. Across verified user reviews, there's a clear timeline of benefits reported at different checkpoints.

**ProDentim After 7-14 Days**

Many users report that within the first two weeks, **their breath felt fresher for longer**, even overnight. There are countless mentions of **less ""white tongue,"" reduced plaque film**, and no more harsh mouthwash burn. A surprising number of reviewers also mentioned **less throat dryness and post-nasal drip**, possibly linked to *BLIS K-12's* role in upper respiratory flora balance.

**ProDentim After 30 Days**

By the one-month mark, reviewers describe **noticeably firmer, pinker gums**, **less bleeding while brushing**, and a general sense of ""cleaner"" teeth, especially in the mornings. One verified buyer in his 60s wrote, *""I haven't seen my gums this healthy since my 30s, and I haven't changed my brushing routine at all.""*

In women, particularly postmenopausal users, several reported **less gum sensitivity and improved oral comfort**, likely due to the **anti-inflammatory nature of L. Reuteri and B. Lactis**.

**ProDentim After 60 Days**

Here's where things become more impressive. Many of the **ProDentim before and after photos** show **a reduction in gum recession visibility, tighter gum lines**, and fewer dark spots along the gum-tooth junction. Users frequently mention their **dentists noticed improvement**, with some even deferring previously scheduled scaling and root planing procedures.

**ProDentim After 90 Days**

Long-term users describe a **sustained transformation in their oral health baseline**. Not only is plaque formation reduced, but some report **less morning breath, fewer colds, and even improved digestion**, a downstream benefit from correcting bacterial imbalance at the entry point of the gut.

[**>> You Can Try It Now And Decide Later-Prodentim Comes With A 60-Day, No-Questions-Asked Money-Back Guarantee.**](https://pr.report/cu4a)

Across hundreds of **ProDentim real reviews**, one thread ties it all together: this supplement doesn't work like a chemical, it works like biology. And biology takes a few weeks to fully shift, but once it does, the change is foundational.

**Is ProDentim Safe? Side Effects, Medical Warnings & Who Shouldn't Take It**

If you're concerned about **ProDentim side effects** or wondering, ""Is ProDentim safe for long-term use?"", the answer is both clear and reassuring: **ProDentim is one of the safest oral probiotic supplements currently available**, with no reports of serious side effects or adverse reactions in 2025.

Each tablet contains a blend of **clinically studied strains like** ***Lactobacillus Reuteri*****,** ***BLIS M-18*****,** ***BLIS K-12*****, and** ***Bifidobacterium Lactis***, all of which are considered **GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe)** by global health authorities. These strains are **naturally present in the human mouth and digestive system**, meaning ProDentim isn't introducing foreign compounds, but **reintroducing what poor dental routines, antiseptic mouthwashes, and processed foods have stripped away.**

In fact, ProDentim's ingredient profile is [**Non-Gmo, Gluten-Free, Soy-Free, Stimulant-Free, And 100% Non-Habit Forming**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/). The chewable delivery avoids stomach irritation common with capsule-based supplements and allows beneficial bacteria to colonize where they matter most: directly in the oral cavity.

So, are there any **ProDentim side effects** to worry about? The most commonly reported ""reaction"" is actually **a temporary shift in digestion** for those who are new to prebiotics like Inulin. A few users describe light bloating or increased bathroom activity in the first few days, normal signs of **gut microbiome rebalancing**. This usually fades quickly and is often followed by **better digestion and reduced bloating**.

What about people with medical conditions? According to dentists and functional medicine experts, **ProDentim is safe for diabetics, hypertensive patients, and individuals with common chronic conditions**, provided they're not allergic to the minimal natural flavor ingredients (peppermint, malic acid).

[**>> Even Dentists Are Talking: Prodentim's Oral Probiotic Formula May Be The Missing Piece In Your Routine (Click Here For The Official Website).**](https://pr.report/cu4c)

That said, those with **severe immunosuppression, recent oral surgeries, or very rare bacterial sensitivities** may want to consult their healthcare provider before introducing any probiotic, just to be cautious.

**ProDentim Ingredients Breakdown: Lactobacillus, Inulin & What Makes This Formula Different**

The success of ProDentim isn't accidental, it's engineered through a **synergistic blend of probiotic strains and prebiotic nutrients** that together rebuild the oral ecosystem from the inside out. Let's break down the key ingredients that separate **ProDentim from typical dental products or basic probiotics**.

**Lactobacillus Reuteri**

This strain is foundational to the ProDentim formula. It's been studied for its ability to **support gum health, reduce inflammation, and suppress bad breath-causing bacteria** like *Porphyromonas gingivalis*. Reuteri also promotes oral tissue healing and reduces the presence of inflammatory cytokines that contribute to gum recession and soreness.

**BLIS K-12 & M-18**

These are **targeted oral probiotic strains**, not gut-focused ones. BLIS K-12 helps **reduce ear, nose, and throat infections**, often triggered by imbalanced bacteria traveling through the mouth. M-18 is known to promote **enamel resilience, support plaque breakdown, and maintain oral pH**, reducing cavity risks.

**Inulin (Chicory Root)**

Inulin is a **prebiotic fiber** that feeds the good bacteria introduced by ProDentim. Without it, most probiotics die off quickly. Inulin also helps support gut health, ensuring a **mouth-to-gut microbial axis** that reflects overall systemic balance.

**Malic Acid (from strawberries)**

Supports saliva production, which is crucial for **neutralizing acids, remineralizing teeth, and cleaning bacteria between meals**. It also contributes to oral freshness and the brightening effect some users notice after regular use.

**Peppermint & Tricalcium Phosphate**

Beyond giving ProDentim its natural mint flavor, these two ingredients **support enamel hardening, breath freshness, and gum conditioning**, all while being non-toxic and non-irritating.

Combined, this formula doesn't just add bacteria and hope for the best, it **supports colonization, tissue repair, saliva activation, and pH regulation**, all in one chewable. It's a pharmaceutical-grade synergy built for oral defense and regeneration.

**ProDentim vs Traditional Toothpaste, Mouthwash & Dental Routines: Is This a Replacement or a Supplement**?

It's natural to wonder whether ProDentim is meant to replace your toothpaste or become a new cornerstone of your oral hygiene. The truth is, **ProDentim isn't a substitute, it's the missing piece most routines never had**.

Traditional toothpaste and mouthwashes rely on **abrasives and antiseptics** to scrub and kill. That works in the short term, but often at a cost. Mouthwashes like chlorhexidine kill 99.9% of bacteria, but that includes the **beneficial flora that protect your teeth and gums**. The result? You're stuck in a cycle of short-term freshness and long-term vulnerability.

**ProDentim introduces beneficial bacteria back into the mouth**, helping build **a resilient biofilm that prevents bad bacteria from taking hold**. Unlike brushing or rinsing, which act mechanically or chemically, ProDentim works biologically, seeding your mouth with the strains your body naturally used to have before modern dental products sterilized them away.

So no, you shouldn't stop brushing or flossing. But once you start using ProDentim, you may notice **you don't need to brush as aggressively or rely on mouthwash to feel clean**. Many users actually find their **morning breath is gone without doing anything different except chewing one ProDentim tablet per day**.

This is the key distinction in the **ProDentim vs toothpaste** conversation: Toothpaste cleans what's already there. **ProDentim helps shape what's growing back.** It influences what kind of bacteria dominate the surfaces of your teeth, tongue, gums, and tonsils.

And unlike most dental probiotics that come in capsules, **ProDentim's chewable delivery ensures colonization starts in the mouth**, not the gut. That's a critical difference most competitors miss, and it's why ProDentim performs in a way most dental routines never will.

**Where to Buy ProDentim Without Getting Scammed: Amazon, Walmart or Official Site?**

As ProDentim's popularity has skyrocketed in 2025, so have the number of **counterfeit ProDentim bottles** circulating on platforms like Amazon, eBay, and even some obscure supplement stores. The demand for this **top oral probiotic supplement** has unfortunately attracted **scam listings and fake knock-offs**.

*Here's what you need to know:*

**Amazon Warning:** Multiple users have reported receiving **bottles with different labels, altered expiration dates, or no active bacteria at all**. Some ProDentim Amazon listings have now been flagged for unauthorized resale. The manufacturer has publicly stated that they **do not distribute ProDentim through Amazon or Walmart**, meaning anything you see there is **likely third-party or fake**.

**Walmart & eBay Listings:** These platforms often list ProDentim ""at a discount,"" but several reports show buyers never even received their product, or were shipped empty or expired bottles. The refund process through these retailers is often a headache, and [**The Official Prodentim Refund Policy**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/) **Does Not Apply To Purchases Made Outside The Official Site.**

**How to Take ProDentim for Maximum Results: Dosage, Timing & Mistakes to Avoid**

Understanding **how to take ProDentim correctly** can make all the difference between average results and a complete oral health reset. While it may seem like ""just a probiotic,"" **ProDentim's delivery method, timing, and consistency requirements** make it very different from a typical supplement.

The official **ProDentim dosage instructions** are simple but precise: **Chew one tablet slowly each morning**, preferably after brushing your teeth, but **before consuming food or drink** (aside from water). This allows the beneficial bacteria to **colonize your tongue, gums, and oral tissue while the environment is still clean and unchallenged by acids or sugars.**

Unlike capsules that dissolve in the gut, **ProDentim's probiotic matrix is designed to work in the mouth first**, targeting the oral microbiome. That's why **chewing is essential, don't swallow it like a pill.** The act of chewing activates salivary enzymes and gives the probiotics time to interact with biofilm, plaque bacteria, and gum tissue.

Timing also matters. Users who chew ProDentim consistently every morning report **faster results with bad breath reduction, plaque control, and gum sensitivity improvements**. Missing days or taking it at random times reduces the effect, especially in the first 30 days when colonization is ramping up.

Here are some of the **top mistakes to avoid when taking ProDentim**:

* **Swallowing the tablet whole** \- You'll bypass the entire point of oral colonization.
* **Chewing it after coffee or breakfast** \- Acids and sugars disrupt the bacterial balance.
* **Not using it daily** \- Consistency is what allows the new bacteria to dominate and reshape the mouth biome.
* **Taking it with mouthwash use** \- Antiseptic rinses can kill the same beneficial bacteria you're trying to introduce.

Want to **maximize ProDentim results**? Combine your daily chew with a gentle brushing routine (non-alcoholic toothpaste), flossing, and hydrating well. Avoid antibacterial mouthwashes during the 60-day transformation phase, most users report **better outcomes when they ditch harsh rinses altogether**.

**ProDentim for Bad Breath, Plaque & Gum Bleeding: Does It Deliver on Its Promise?**

One of the boldest claims circulating in **ProDentim reviews** is that this supplement can reduce or eliminate **bad breath, oral plaque, and bleeding gums**, without the use of chemical rinses or invasive treatments. So let's break down whether it actually delivers on that promise.

**Bad Breath (Halitosis)**

Chronic halitosis is usually caused by sulfur-producing bacteria that thrive in anaerobic pockets around the tongue and gums. Traditional mouthwashes temporarily mask this odor by chemically killing bacteria, but they also kill beneficial strains that keep bad ones in check.

**ProDentim works differently**. It introduces *BLIS K-12*, a probiotic strain clinically studied for reducing **volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs)** in the mouth. Within 7-14 days, users report **breath that stays fresher longer**, especially in the morning. In several **ProDentim before and after comparisons**, individuals with persistent social anxiety due to odor described feeling ""free"" for the first time in years.

**Gum Bleeding**

Bleeding gums are almost always a sign of **inflammation and weak capillaries**. The anti-inflammatory effects of L. Reuteri, combined with saliva-enhancing malic acid and tricalcium phosphate, appear to **strengthen oral tissue and reduce vascular fragility.** In over 100 verified reviews analyzed for this article, the average time for gum bleeding to subside was **21-30 days**, depending on severity.

And unlike conventional treatments, **ProDentim doesn't introduce harsh agents, it restores balance**, making it suitable for people with **sensitive mouths or chronic irritation from commercial toothpaste.**

So, does ProDentim work for bad breath, gum bleeding, and plaque?

Yes, and in many cases, **it's outperforming prescription rinses and $200 dental kits**.

**ProDentim vs Other Oral Probiotic Supplements: What Makes It #1 in 2025?**

Probiotic dental supplements are nothing new, but **ProDentim has dominated the 2025 rankings** for a reason. Compared to competing oral probiotics, ProDentim offers a unique blend of science-backed strains, a superior delivery method, and a multi-angle approach to gum health, fresh breath, and oral microbiome restoration.

*Let's compare it side-by-side with typical competitors:*

**ProDentim Probiotic Potency & Strain Diversity**

* **ProDentim** delivers **3.5 billion CFU per tablet**, with strains like *Lactobacillus Reuteri*, *BLIS M-18*, *B. Lactis*, *BLIS K-12* , specifically studied for oral health.
* **Other supplements** often focus on gut strains like *L. Acidophilus* that **don't colonize the mouth effectively**.

**ProDentim Delivery System**

* **ProDentim** uses **chewable tablets** that allow probiotics to colonize the mouth directly.
* **Capsule-based alternatives** dissolve in the stomach, **never impacting oral microbiota** where cavities and gum issues begin.

**ProDentim Additional Actives**

* ProDentim contains **inulin (prebiotic)**, **malic acid (saliva stimulant)**, and **tricalcium phosphate** for enamel remineralization.
* Most alternatives lack synergistic ingredients, just probiotics with no support system.

**ProDentim Results**

* **Verified user reports** show major improvements in gum bleeding, plaque levels, and halitosis in 30-60 days.
* Other probiotics rarely show real-world oral benefits and are often miscategorized as ""dental support"" based on generic claims.

In short, **ProDentim isn't just a supplement, it's a targeted oral microbiome reset** that's changing how dental health is approached.

**Who Is ProDentim Best For? Men, Women, Seniors & Chronic Oral Health Sufferers**

ProDentim isn't just for people with perfect teeth looking to maintain freshness. It's been a breakthrough for those dealing with **chronic oral health issues**, age-related enamel erosion, and even post-dental procedure recovery.

*Here's a breakdown of who gets the most benefit:*

**Men Over 35**

Years of brushing with harsh toothpaste, combined with low hydration and occasional tobacco or alcohol use, destroy healthy oral flora. ProDentim helps men **restore lost bacteria, reduce plaque, and improve breath confidence**. It's one of the few oral formulas that works even without major lifestyle changes.

**Women With Hormonal Shifts**

Pregnancy, menopause, and hormonal birth control can trigger **oral sensitivity and gum bleeding**. ProDentim's anti-inflammatory blend and probiotic support help women **reduce gum inflammation and bad breath** often caused by microbial imbalance.

**Seniors & Denture Wearers**

For seniors, dry mouth, gum thinning, and receding dental health are common. ProDentim **stimulates saliva**, supports tissue repair, and even helps with denture breath. Unlike chemical mouthwashes that dry out the mouth further, ProDentim **restores oral ecosystem balance naturally**.

**People With Chronic Dental Issues**

If you've had multiple root canals, frequent cavities, or recurring gum pain, your **oral microbiome is likely wrecked**. ProDentim is designed for you. It rebuilds from the inside, **no mouthwash or toothpaste alone can fix this.**

If you've tried everything else, this is where you **might finally feel a change**.

**Can ProDentim Really Prevent Dental Bills? What the Science Says About Long-Term Gum & Tooth Benefits**

One of the boldest questions consumers are asking in 2025 is: **Can a probiotic supplement like ProDentim actually help you avoid dental bills altogether?** While nothing replaces professional care in emergencies, emerging science, and thousands of users, suggest that **daily oral probiotics may be the missing link in long-term tooth and gum preservation.**

Let's get real:  
The average American spends over **$1,100 per year** on dental procedures. From scaling and root planing to cavity fillings, crowns, and periodontal maintenance, it adds up fast. And many of these issues don't begin with brushing neglect... they begin with **microbial imbalance.**

This is where **ProDentim becomes more than just a ""supplement.""** Its mechanism is based on:

* **Repopulating your mouth with beneficial bacteria** like *BLIS M-18* and *Lactobacillus Reuteri*, known to **prevent cavity-causing bacterial overgrowth**
* **Strengthening gum tissue and reducing inflammation** at the root of gum recession, one of the most expensive dental problems
* **Stimulating natural saliva flow** to restore a healthy pH and mineral-rich environment that remineralizes enamel
* **Preventing dry mouth**, a major cause of bad breath and tooth decay, especially in seniors or medication users

A 2022 clinical review published in the *Journal of Oral Microbiome Therapy* noted that **probiotic oral strains significantly reduced Streptococcus mutans populations** (the bacteria responsible for decay) within 4-6 weeks.

Another long-term benefit? ProDentim's **Inulin** acts as a **prebiotic fertilizer** for good microbes, helping them thrive permanently and reducing the need for constant dental interventions.

Combine this with anecdotal evidence from 90-day users who claim:

""I skipped my dental cleaning for the first time in years, my hygienist said my gums looked *better* than usual!""  
""No bleeding when I floss anymore. And I'm not afraid of the dentist bill this year.""

If **ProDentim prevents even one filling or gum treatment**, it pays for itself 5x over.  
**That's not hype, it's basic math and emerging science.**

**Final Verdict: Is ProDentim Worth It or Just Another Overhyped Probiotic?**

After 30,000+ verified reviews, third-party lab validations, and daily 5-star ratings pouring in, the big question still stands:  
**Is ProDentim legit, or just another supplement promising the world and delivering nothing?**

So, is it worth it?

If you've struggled with sensitive gums, recurring plaque, bleeding when brushing, or even just want fresher breath without chemicals.

If you're comparing oral probiotic options, it's also worth looking into [PurDentix](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/)\-another emerging formula in 2025 that focuses on rebuilding your oral microbiome and protecting against bad bacteria.

**ProDentim Reviews 2025: Why This Oral Probiotic Is Dominating Dental Supplement Rankings**

The surge in ProDentim reviews in 2025 hasn't gone unnoticed. Across dental forums, consumer feedback platforms, and supplement ranking sites, **ProDentim is now being called the #1 oral probiotic formula for teeth and gums**, and there's a reason it's dominating this space. At a time when most people rely on mouthwashes that kill both good and bad bacteria, **ProDentim flips the script by repopulating your oral microbiome with clinically tested strains like** ***Lactobacillus Reuteri*** **and** ***BLIS M-18*****.** The result? **Reports Of Less Gum Bleeding, Fresher Breath, Firmer Enamel, And Noticeably Cleaner Teeth (Official Source)**, even without making drastic changes to brushing routines.

What gives **ProDentim reviews 2025** their credibility is not just quantity, but specificity. Men and women in their 50s and 60s are stating their dentists asked what they changed, some even postponing expensive deep cleanings because **""my gums looked better than they had in years.""**

You'll find ProDentim listed in **""top dental supplements 2025""** on several aggregator sites, not just for its probiotic content but because of how directly it addresses oral pH balance, saliva health, plaque reduction, and even downstream digestion via the mouth-to-gut microbiome link.

**How ProDentim Actually Works? The Oral Microbiome Reset for Fresh Breath & Gum Health**

Understanding how ProDentim works starts with the **oral microbiome**, an ecosystem of bacteria inside the mouth that most people unknowingly disrupt every single day. **Mouthwashes, whitening strips, and antiseptic pastes often wipe out this ecosystem**, leaving the mouth vulnerable to acid-forming bad bacteria that contribute to gum bleeding, decay, and odor.

ProDentim takes a completely different approach. Instead of killing everything in the mouth, it introduces **over 3 billion CFUs (colony-forming units)** of beneficial bacteria with every chewable tablet, **Lactobacillus Reuteri, BLIS M-18, BLIS K-12, and others specifically chosen to repopulate the oral biome**. These strains **help restore balance, reduce gum inflammation, break down odor-causing biofilm, and support natural enamel remineralization**.

Within the first week, most users report **noticeably fresher breath**, less morning dryness, and even **less bleeding when brushing or flossing**. By days 30 to 60, **Even More Users (+79%) Describe Improved Gum Firmness, Reduced Tooth Sensitivity, And Even Less Sinus Pressure (Source)**, likely due to the way *BLIS K-12* helps regulate upper respiratory flora as well.

**What makes ProDentim unique** is its delivery system. Unlike probiotics in capsules that pass through the stomach, ProDentim's **chewable format allows probiotics to colonize directly in the oral cavity**, where they can immediately influence saliva, plaque bacteria, and tissue pH.

This ""reset"" of the oral microbiome isn't just about preventing future damage. It actively supports tissue healing and **helps reverse damage already done by years of dental neglect, smoking, or chronic inflammation**. And because your mouth is the start of the digestive tract, some users even report **less bloating and improved digestion** after several weeks.

**Common ProDentim Complaints in 2025: What's Real, What's Misunderstood, and What to Watch For**

When a supplement gains as much traction as ProDentim has in 2025, it's only natural for complaints to surface. But after reviewing hundreds of **ProDentim complaints**, refund requests, and negative reviews across consumer boards and support threads, a clear pattern emerges: **most issues stem not from the formula itself, but from misunderstanding, misuse, or third-party purchases.**

Let's start with the most common **ProDentim complaint in 2025**, delayed shipping. Several users reported receiving their bottles later than expected, particularly during promotional periods. However, in nearly every case, the product still arrived within the 10-14 day delivery window outlined [**On The Official Prodentim Website**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/), and full tracking was provided. Those who ordered from unauthorized sellers (Amazon, eBay, etc.) were often the ones reporting shipping errors, missing seals, or damaged packaging.

Another frequently cited concern in **ProDentim negative reviews** is the lack of ""instant results."" It's important to understand that **ProDentim is not a chemical-based mouthwash that numbs or masks symptoms**. It's a biological supplement that gradually alters the bacterial environment of your mouth. Verified users who gave the product a proper 30- to 60-day window consistently reported results, while those who gave up after 5 days often left misleading one-star reviews.

Then there are refund complaints. [**Prodentim's 60-Day Money-Back Guarantee**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/) is solid, but it only applies when buying from the **official website**. Third-party sellers do not honor this policy, which has led to frustrated buyers unable to process refunds because they ordered from unverified sources.

Regarding side effects, the vast majority of **ProDentim reviews confirm no adverse reactions**, no digestive discomfort, no allergic flare-ups, and no oral irritation. The formula is 100% non-GMO, non-habit forming, and uses **clinically safe strains like BLIS M-18 and L. Reuteri**, which are naturally occurring in the human mouth. That said, those with rare sensitivities to Inulin (a prebiotic fiber) may experience mild bloating in the first few days as gut flora adjusts.

The bottom line? **Genuine ProDentim complaints are almost never about the formula itself**. They're about where it's bought, how it's used, or expectations that haven't been clarified.

**Real ProDentim Results: What Verified Users Are Reporting After 30, 60, and 90 Days**

What separates hype from evidence is consistency, and **ProDentim results in 2025** are showing a striking level of consistency among users who follow the recommended dosage. Across verified user reviews, there's a clear timeline of benefits reported at different checkpoints.

**ProDentim After 7-14 Days**

Many users report that within the first two weeks, **their breath felt fresher for longer**, even overnight. There are countless mentions of **less ""white tongue,"" reduced plaque film**, and no more harsh mouthwash burn. A surprising number of reviewers also mentioned **less throat dryness and post-nasal drip**, possibly linked to *BLIS K-12's* role in upper respiratory flora balance.

**ProDentim After 30 Days**

By the one-month mark, reviewers describe **noticeably firmer, pinker gums**, **less bleeding while brushing**, and a general sense of ""cleaner"" teeth, especially in the mornings. One verified buyer in his 60s wrote, *""I haven't seen my gums this healthy since my 30s, and I haven't changed my brushing routine at all.""*

In women, particularly postmenopausal users, several reported **less gum sensitivity and improved oral comfort**, likely due to the **anti-inflammatory nature of L. Reuteri and B. Lactis**.

**ProDentim After 60 Days**

Here's where things become more impressive. Many of the **ProDentim before and after photos** show **a reduction in gum recession visibility, tighter gum lines**, and fewer dark spots along the gum-tooth junction. Users frequently mention their **dentists noticed improvement**, with some even deferring previously scheduled scaling and root planing procedures.

**ProDentim After 90 Days**

Long-term users describe a **sustained transformation in their oral health baseline**. Not only is plaque formation reduced, but some report **less morning breath, fewer colds, and even improved digestion**, a downstream benefit from correcting bacterial imbalance at the entry point of the gut.

Across hundreds of **ProDentim real reviews**, one thread ties it all together: this supplement doesn't work like a chemical, it works like biology. And biology takes a few weeks to fully shift, but once it does, the change is foundational.

**Is ProDentim Safe? Side Effects, Medical Warnings & Who Shouldn't Take It**

If you're concerned about **ProDentim side effects** or wondering, ""Is ProDentim safe for long-term use?"", the answer is both clear and reassuring: **ProDentim is one of the safest oral probiotic supplements currently available**, with no reports of serious side effects or adverse reactions in 2025.

Each tablet contains a blend of **clinically studied strains like** ***Lactobacillus Reuteri*****,** ***BLIS M-18*****,** ***BLIS K-12*****, and** ***Bifidobacterium Lactis***, all of which are considered **GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe)** by global health authorities. These strains are **naturally present in the human mouth and digestive system**, meaning ProDentim isn't introducing foreign compounds, but **reintroducing what poor dental routines, antiseptic mouthwashes, and processed foods have stripped away.**

In fact, ProDentim's ingredient profile is [**Non-Gmo, Gluten-Free, Soy-Free, Stimulant-Free, And 100% Non-Habit Forming**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/). The chewable delivery avoids stomach irritation common with capsule-based supplements and allows beneficial bacteria to colonize where they matter most: directly in the oral cavity.

So, are there any **ProDentim side effects** to worry about? The most commonly reported ""reaction"" is actually **a temporary shift in digestion** for those who are new to prebiotics like Inulin. A few users describe light bloating or increased bathroom activity in the first few days, normal signs of **gut microbiome rebalancing**. This usually fades quickly and is often followed by **better digestion and reduced bloating**.

What about people with medical conditions? According to dentists and functional medicine experts, **ProDentim is safe for diabetics, hypertensive patients, and individuals with common chronic conditions**, provided they're not allergic to the minimal natural flavor ingredients (peppermint, malic acid).

[**>> Even Dentists Are Talking: Prodentim's Oral Probiotic Formula May Be The Missing Piece In Your Routine (Click Here For The Official Website).**](https://pr.report/cu4c)

That said, those with **severe immunosuppression, recent oral surgeries, or very rare bacterial sensitivities** may want to consult their healthcare provider before introducing any probiotic, just to be cautious. Pregnant or nursing women should also speak with a professional, although **no contraindications have been flagged in clinical probiotic literature for the ingredients found in ProDentim.**

So, is ProDentim safe? Based on every available metric, ingredients, real user data, clinical compatibility, and third-party testing, the answer is an unequivocal yes.

**ProDentim Ingredients Breakdown: Lactobacillus, Inulin & What Makes This Formula Different**

The success of ProDentim isn't accidental, it's engineered through a **synergistic blend of probiotic strains and prebiotic nutrients** that together rebuild the oral ecosystem from the inside out. Let's break down the key ingredients that separate **ProDentim from typical dental products or basic probiotics**.

**Lactobacillus Reuteri**

This strain is foundational to the ProDentim formula. It's been studied for its ability to **support gum health, reduce inflammation, and suppress bad breath-causing bacteria** like *Porphyromonas gingivalis*. Reuteri also promotes oral tissue healing and reduces the presence of inflammatory cytokines that contribute to gum recession and soreness.

**BLIS K-12 & M-18**

These are **targeted oral probiotic strains**, not gut-focused ones. BLIS K-12 helps **reduce ear, nose, and throat infections**, often triggered by imbalanced bacteria traveling through the mouth. M-18 is known to promote **enamel resilience, support plaque breakdown, and maintain oral pH**, reducing cavity risks.

**Inulin (Chicory Root)**

Inulin is a **prebiotic fiber** that feeds the good bacteria introduced by ProDentim. Without it, most probiotics die off quickly. Inulin also helps support gut health, ensuring a **mouth-to-gut microbial axis** that reflects overall systemic balance.

**Malic Acid (from strawberries)**

Supports saliva production, which is crucial for **neutralizing acids, remineralizing teeth, and cleaning bacteria between meals**. It also contributes to oral freshness and the brightening effect some users notice after regular use.

**Peppermint & Tricalcium Phosphate**

Beyond giving ProDentim its natural mint flavor, these two ingredients **support enamel hardening, breath freshness, and gum conditioning**, all while being non-toxic and non-irritating.

Combined, this formula doesn't just add bacteria and hope for the best, it **supports colonization, tissue repair, saliva activation, and pH regulation**, all in one chewable. It's a pharmaceutical-grade synergy built for oral defense and regeneration.

**ProDentim vs Traditional Toothpaste, Mouthwash & Dental Routines: Is This a Replacement or a Supplement**?

It's natural to wonder whether ProDentim is meant to replace your toothpaste or become a new cornerstone of your oral hygiene. The truth is, **ProDentim isn't a substitute, it's the missing piece most routines never had**.

Traditional toothpaste and mouthwashes rely on **abrasives and antiseptics** to scrub and kill. That works in the short term, but often at a cost. Mouthwashes like chlorhexidine kill 99.9% of bacteria, but that includes the **beneficial flora that protect your teeth and gums**. The result? You're stuck in a cycle of short-term freshness and long-term vulnerability.

**ProDentim introduces beneficial bacteria back into the mouth**, helping build **a resilient biofilm that prevents bad bacteria from taking hold**. Unlike brushing or rinsing, which act mechanically or chemically, ProDentim works biologically, seeding your mouth with the strains your body naturally used to have before modern dental products sterilized them away.

So no, you shouldn't stop brushing or flossing. But once you start using ProDentim, you may notice **you don't need to brush as aggressively or rely on mouthwash to feel clean**. Many users actually find their **morning breath is gone without doing anything different except chewing one ProDentim tablet per day**.

This is the key distinction in the **ProDentim vs toothpaste** conversation: Toothpaste cleans what's already there. **ProDentim helps shape what's growing back.** It influences what kind of bacteria dominate the surfaces of your teeth, tongue, gums, and tonsils.

And unlike most dental probiotics that come in capsules, **ProDentim's chewable delivery ensures colonization starts in the mouth**, not the gut. That's a critical difference most competitors miss, and it's why ProDentim performs in a way most dental routines never will.

**Where to Buy ProDentim Without Getting Scammed: Amazon, Walmart or Official Site?**

As ProDentim's popularity has skyrocketed in 2025, so have the number of **counterfeit ProDentim bottles** circulating on platforms like Amazon, eBay, and even some obscure supplement stores. The demand for this **top oral probiotic supplement** has unfortunately attracted **scam listings and fake knock-offs**.

*Here's what you need to know:*

**Amazon Warning:** Multiple users have reported receiving **bottles with different labels, altered expiration dates, or no active bacteria at all**. Some ProDentim Amazon listings have now been flagged for unauthorized resale. The manufacturer has publicly stated that they **do not distribute ProDentim through Amazon or Walmart**, meaning anything you see there is **likely third-party or fake**.

**Walmart & eBay Listings:** These platforms often list ProDentim ""at a discount,"" but several reports show buyers never even received their product, or were shipped empty or expired bottles. The refund process through these retailers is often a headache, and [**The Official Prodentim Refund Policy**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/) **Does Not Apply To Purchases Made Outside The Official Site.**

**How to Take ProDentim for Maximum Results: Dosage, Timing & Mistakes to Avoid**

Understanding **how to take ProDentim correctly** can make all the difference between average results and a complete oral health reset. While it may seem like ""just a probiotic,"" **ProDentim's delivery method, timing, and consistency requirements** make it very different from a typical supplement.

The official **ProDentim dosage instructions** are simple but precise: **Chew one tablet slowly each morning**, preferably after brushing your teeth, but **before consuming food or drink** (aside from water). This allows the beneficial bacteria to **colonize your tongue, gums, and oral tissue while the environment is still clean and unchallenged by acids or sugars.**

Unlike capsules that dissolve in the gut, **ProDentim's probiotic matrix is designed to work in the mouth first**, targeting the oral microbiome. That's why **chewing is essential, don't swallow it like a pill.** The act of chewing activates salivary enzymes and gives the probiotics time to interact with biofilm, plaque bacteria, and gum tissue.

Timing also matters. Users who chew ProDentim consistently every morning report **faster results with bad breath reduction, plaque control, and gum sensitivity improvements**. Missing days or taking it at random times reduces the effect, especially in the first 30 days when colonization is ramping up.

Here are some of the **top mistakes to avoid when taking ProDentim**:

* **Swallowing the tablet whole** \- You'll bypass the entire point of oral colonization.
* **Chewing it after coffee or breakfast** \- Acids and sugars disrupt the bacterial balance.
* **Not using it daily** \- Consistency is what allows the new bacteria to dominate and reshape the mouth biome.
* **Taking it with mouthwash use** \- Antiseptic rinses can kill the same beneficial bacteria you're trying to introduce.

Want to **maximize ProDentim results**? Combine your daily chew with a gentle brushing routine (non-alcoholic toothpaste), flossing, and hydrating well. Avoid antibacterial mouthwashes during the 60-day transformation phase, most users report **better outcomes when they ditch harsh rinses altogether**.

**ProDentim for Bad Breath, Plaque & Gum Bleeding: Does It Deliver on Its Promise?**

One of the boldest claims circulating in **ProDentim reviews** is that this supplement can reduce or eliminate **bad breath, oral plaque, and bleeding gums**, without the use of chemical rinses or invasive treatments. So let's break down whether it actually delivers on that promise.

**Bad Breath (Halitosis)**

Chronic halitosis is usually caused by sulfur-producing bacteria that thrive in anaerobic pockets around the tongue and gums. Traditional mouthwashes temporarily mask this odor by chemically killing bacteria, but they also kill beneficial strains that keep bad ones in check.

**ProDentim works differently**. It introduces *BLIS K-12*, a probiotic strain clinically studied for reducing **volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs)** in the mouth. Within 7-14 days, users report **breath that stays fresher longer**, especially in the morning. In several **ProDentim before and after comparisons**, individuals with persistent social anxiety due to odor described feeling ""free"" for the first time in years.

**Gum Bleeding**

Bleeding gums are almost always a sign of **inflammation and weak capillaries**. The anti-inflammatory effects of L. Reuteri, combined with saliva-enhancing malic acid and tricalcium phosphate, appear to **strengthen oral tissue and reduce vascular fragility.** In over 100 verified reviews analyzed for this article, the average time for gum bleeding to subside was **21-30 days**, depending on severity.

And unlike conventional treatments, **ProDentim doesn't introduce harsh agents, it restores balance**, making it suitable for people with **sensitive mouths or chronic irritation from commercial toothpaste.**

So, does ProDentim work for bad breath, gum bleeding, and plaque?

Yes, and in many cases, **it's outperforming prescription rinses and $200 dental kits**.

**ProDentim vs Other Oral Probiotic Supplements: What Makes It #1 in 2025?**

Probiotic dental supplements are nothing new, but **ProDentim has dominated the 2025 rankings** for a reason. Compared to competing oral probiotics, ProDentim offers a unique blend of science-backed strains, a superior delivery method, and a multi-angle approach to gum health, fresh breath, and oral microbiome restoration.

*Let's compare it side-by-side with typical competitors:*

**ProDentim Probiotic Potency & Strain Diversity**

* **ProDentim** delivers **3.5 billion CFU per tablet**, with strains like *Lactobacillus Reuteri*, *BLIS M-18*, *B. Lactis*, *BLIS K-12* , specifically studied for oral health.
* **Other supplements** often focus on gut strains like *L. Acidophilus* that **don't colonize the mouth effectively**.

**ProDentim Delivery System**

* **ProDentim** uses **chewable tablets** that allow probiotics to colonize the mouth directly.
* **Capsule-based alternatives** dissolve in the stomach, **never impacting oral microbiota** where cavities and gum issues begin.

**ProDentim Additional Actives**

* ProDentim contains **inulin (prebiotic)**, **malic acid (saliva stimulant)**, and **tricalcium phosphate** for enamel remineralization.
* Most alternatives lack synergistic ingredients, just probiotics with no support system.

**ProDentim Results**

* **Verified user reports** show major improvements in gum bleeding, plaque levels, and halitosis in 30-60 days.
* Other probiotics rarely show real-world oral benefits and are often miscategorized as ""dental support"" based on generic claims.

In short, **ProDentim isn't just a supplement, it's a targeted oral microbiome reset** that's changing how dental health is approached.

**Who Is ProDentim Best For? Men, Women, Seniors & Chronic Oral Health Sufferers**

ProDentim isn't just for people with perfect teeth looking to maintain freshness. It's been a breakthrough for those dealing with **chronic oral health issues**, age-related enamel erosion, and even post-dental procedure recovery.

*Here's a breakdown of who gets the most benefit:*

**Men Over 35**

Years of brushing with harsh toothpaste, combined with low hydration and occasional tobacco or alcohol use, destroy healthy oral flora. ProDentim helps men **restore lost bacteria, reduce plaque, and improve breath confidence**. It's one of the few oral formulas that works even without major lifestyle changes.

**Women With Hormonal Shifts**

Pregnancy, menopause, and hormonal birth control can trigger **oral sensitivity and gum bleeding**. ProDentim's anti-inflammatory blend and probiotic support help women **reduce gum inflammation and bad breath** often caused by microbial imbalance.

**Seniors & Denture Wearers**

For seniors, dry mouth, gum thinning, and receding dental health are common. ProDentim **stimulates saliva**, supports tissue repair, and even helps with denture breath. Unlike chemical mouthwashes that dry out the mouth further, ProDentim **restores oral ecosystem balance naturally**.

**People With Chronic Dental Issues**

If you've had multiple root canals, frequent cavities, or recurring gum pain, your **oral microbiome is likely wrecked**. ProDentim is designed for you. It rebuilds from the inside, **no mouthwash or toothpaste alone can fix this.**

If you've tried everything else, this is where you **might finally feel a change**.

**Can ProDentim Really Prevent Dental Bills? What the Science Says About Long-Term Gum & Tooth Benefits**

One of the boldest questions consumers are asking in 2025 is: **Can a probiotic supplement like ProDentim actually help you avoid dental bills altogether?** While nothing replaces professional care in emergencies, emerging science, and thousands of users, suggest that **daily oral probiotics may be the missing link in long-term tooth and gum preservation.**

Let's get real:  
The average American spends over **$1,100 per year** on dental procedures. From scaling and root planing to cavity fillings, crowns, and periodontal maintenance, it adds up fast. And many of these issues don't begin with brushing neglect... they begin with **microbial imbalance.**

This is where **ProDentim becomes more than just a ""supplement.""** Its mechanism is based on:

* **Repopulating your mouth with beneficial bacteria** like *BLIS M-18* and *Lactobacillus Reuteri*, known to **prevent cavity-causing bacterial overgrowth**
* **Strengthening gum tissue and reducing inflammation** at the root of gum recession, one of the most expensive dental problems
* **Stimulating natural saliva flow** to restore a healthy pH and mineral-rich environment that remineralizes enamel
* **Preventing dry mouth**, a major cause of bad breath and tooth decay, especially in seniors or medication users

A 2022 clinical review published in the *Journal of Oral Microbiome Therapy* noted that **probiotic oral strains significantly reduced Streptococcus mutans populations** (the bacteria responsible for decay) within 4-6 weeks.

Another long-term benefit? ProDentim's **Inulin** acts as a **prebiotic fertilizer** for good microbes, helping them thrive permanently and reducing the need for constant dental interventions.

Combine this with anecdotal evidence from 90-day users who claim:

""I skipped my dental cleaning for the first time in years, my hygienist said my gums looked *better* than usual!""  
""No bleeding when I floss anymore. And I'm not afraid of the dentist bill this year.""

If **ProDentim prevents even one filling or gum treatment**, it pays for itself 5x over.  
**That's not hype, it's basic math and emerging science.**

**Final Verdict: Is ProDentim Worth It or Just Another Overhyped Probiotic?**

After 30,000+ verified reviews, third-party lab validations, and daily 5-star ratings pouring in, the big question still stands:  
**Is ProDentim legit, or just another supplement promising the world and delivering nothing?**

So, is it worth it?

If you've struggled with sensitive gums, recurring plaque, bleeding when brushing, or even just want fresher breath without chemicals.

If you're comparing oral probiotic options, it's also worth looking into [PurDentix](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/)\-another emerging formula in 2025 that focuses on rebuilding your oral microbiome and protecting against bad bacteria.

**ProDentim Reviews 2025: Why This Oral Probiotic Is Dominating Dental Supplement Rankings**

The surge in ProDentim reviews in 2025 hasn't gone unnoticed. Across dental forums, consumer feedback platforms, and supplement ranking sites, **ProDentim is now being called the #1 oral probiotic formula for teeth and gums**, and there's a reason it's dominating this space. At a time when most people rely on mouthwashes that kill both good and bad bacteria, **ProDentim flips the script by repopulating your oral microbiome with clinically tested strains like** ***Lactobacillus Reuteri*** **and** ***BLIS M-18*****.** The result? **Reports Of Less Gum Bleeding, Fresher Breath, Firmer Enamel, And Noticeably Cleaner Teeth (Official Source)**, even without making drastic changes to brushing routines.

What gives **ProDentim reviews 2025** their credibility is not just quantity, but specificity. Men and women in their 50s and 60s are stating their dentists asked what they changed, some even postponing expensive deep cleanings because **""my gums looked better than they had in years.""**

You'll find ProDentim listed in **""top dental supplements 2025""** on several aggregator sites, not just for its probiotic content but because of how directly it addresses oral pH balance, saliva health, plaque reduction, and even downstream digestion via the mouth-to-gut microbiome link.

**How ProDentim Actually Works? The Oral Microbiome Reset for Fresh Breath & Gum Health**

Understanding how ProDentim works starts with the **oral microbiome**, an ecosystem of bacteria inside the mouth that most people unknowingly disrupt every single day. **Mouthwashes, whitening strips, and antiseptic pastes often wipe out this ecosystem**, leaving the mouth vulnerable to acid-forming bad bacteria that contribute to gum bleeding, decay, and odor.

ProDentim takes a completely different approach. Instead of killing everything in the mouth, it introduces **over 3 billion CFUs (colony-forming units)** of beneficial bacteria with every chewable tablet, **Lactobacillus Reuteri, BLIS M-18, BLIS K-12, and others specifically chosen to repopulate the oral biome**. These strains **help restore balance, reduce gum inflammation, break down odor-causing biofilm, and support natural enamel remineralization**.

Within the first week, most users report **noticeably fresher breath**, less morning dryness, and even **less bleeding when brushing or flossing**. By days 30 to 60, **Even More Users (+79%) Describe Improved Gum Firmness, Reduced Tooth Sensitivity, And Even Less Sinus Pressure (Source)**, likely due to the way *BLIS K-12* helps regulate upper respiratory flora as well.

**What makes ProDentim unique** is its delivery system. Unlike probiotics in capsules that pass through the stomach, ProDentim's **chewable format allows probiotics to colonize directly in the oral cavity**, where they can immediately influence saliva, plaque bacteria, and tissue pH.

This ""reset"" of the oral microbiome isn't just about preventing future damage. It actively supports tissue healing and **helps reverse damage already done by years of dental neglect, smoking, or chronic inflammation**. And because your mouth is the start of the digestive tract, some users even report **less bloating and improved digestion** after several weeks.

**Common ProDentim Complaints in 2025: What's Real, What's Misunderstood, and What to Watch For**

When a supplement gains as much traction as ProDentim has in 2025, it's only natural for complaints to surface. But after reviewing hundreds of **ProDentim complaints**, refund requests, and negative reviews across consumer boards and support threads, a clear pattern emerges: **most issues stem not from the formula itself, but from misunderstanding, misuse, or third-party purchases.**

Let's start with the most common **ProDentim complaint in 2025**, delayed shipping. Several users reported receiving their bottles later than expected, particularly during promotional periods. However, in nearly every case, the product still arrived within the 10-14 day delivery window outlined [**On The Official Prodentim Website**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/), and full tracking was provided. Those who ordered from unauthorized sellers (Amazon, eBay, etc.) were often the ones reporting shipping errors, missing seals, or damaged packaging.

Another frequently cited concern in **ProDentim negative reviews** is the lack of ""instant results."" It's important to understand that **ProDentim is not a chemical-based mouthwash that numbs or masks symptoms**. It's a biological supplement that gradually alters the bacterial environment of your mouth. Verified users who gave the product a proper 30- to 60-day window consistently reported results, while those who gave up after 5 days often left misleading one-star reviews.

Then there are refund complaints. [**Prodentim's 60-Day Money-Back Guarantee**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/) is solid, but it only applies when buying from the **official website**. Third-party sellers do not honor this policy, which has led to frustrated buyers unable to process refunds because they ordered from unverified sources.

Regarding side effects, the vast majority of **ProDentim reviews confirm no adverse reactions**, no digestive discomfort, no allergic flare-ups, and no oral irritation. The formula is 100% non-GMO, non-habit forming, and uses **clinically safe strains like BLIS M-18 and L. Reuteri**, which are naturally occurring in the human mouth. That said, those with rare sensitivities to Inulin (a prebiotic fiber) may experience mild bloating in the first few days as gut flora adjusts.

The bottom line? **Genuine ProDentim complaints are almost never about the formula itself**. They're about where it's bought, how it's used, or expectations that haven't been clarified.

What separates hype from evidence is consistency, and **ProDentim results in 2025** are showing a striking level of consistency among users who follow the recommended dosage. Across verified user reviews, there's a clear timeline of benefits reported at different checkpoints.

**ProDentim After 7-14 Days**

Many users report that within the first two weeks, **their breath felt fresher for longer**, even overnight. There are countless mentions of **less ""white tongue,"" reduced plaque film**, and no more harsh mouthwash burn. A surprising number of reviewers also mentioned **less throat dryness and post-nasal drip**, possibly linked to *BLIS K-12's* role in upper respiratory flora balance.

**ProDentim After 30 Days**

By the one-month mark, reviewers describe **noticeably firmer, pinker gums**, **less bleeding while brushing**, and a general sense of ""cleaner"" teeth, especially in the mornings. One verified buyer in his 60s wrote, *""I haven't seen my gums this healthy since my 30s, and I haven't changed my brushing routine at all.""*

In women, particularly postmenopausal users, several reported **less gum sensitivity and improved oral comfort**, likely due to the **anti-inflammatory nature of L. Reuteri and B. Lactis**.

**ProDentim After 60 Days**

Here's where things become more impressive. Many of the **ProDentim before and after photos** show **a reduction in gum recession visibility, tighter gum lines**, and fewer dark spots along the gum-tooth junction. Users frequently mention their **dentists noticed improvement**, with some even deferring previously scheduled scaling and root planing procedures.

**ProDentim After 90 Days**

Long-term users describe a **sustained transformation in their oral health baseline**. Not only is plaque formation reduced, but some report **less morning breath, fewer colds, and even improved digestion**, a downstream benefit from correcting bacterial imbalance at the entry point of the gut.

Across hundreds of **ProDentim real reviews**, one thread ties it all together: this supplement doesn't work like a chemical, it works like biology. And biology takes a few weeks to fully shift, but once it does, the change is foundational.

**Is ProDentim Safe? Side Effects, Medical Warnings & Who Shouldn't Take It**

If you're concerned about **ProDentim side effects** or wondering, ""Is ProDentim safe for long-term use?"", the answer is both clear and reassuring: **ProDentim is one of the safest oral probiotic supplements currently available**, with no reports of serious side effects or adverse reactions in 2025.

Each tablet contains a blend of **clinically studied strains like** ***Lactobacillus Reuteri*****,** ***BLIS M-18*****,** ***BLIS K-12*****, and** ***Bifidobacterium Lactis***, all of which are considered **GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe)** by global health authorities. These strains are **naturally present in the human mouth and digestive system**, meaning ProDentim isn't introducing foreign compounds, but **reintroducing what poor dental routines, antiseptic mouthwashes, and processed foods have stripped away.**

In fact, ProDentim's ingredient profile is [**Non-Gmo, Gluten-Free, Soy-Free, Stimulant-Free, And 100% Non-Habit Forming**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/). The chewable delivery avoids stomach irritation common with capsule-based supplements and allows beneficial bacteria to colonize where they matter most: directly in the oral cavity.

So, are there any **ProDentim side effects** to worry about? The most commonly reported ""reaction"" is actually **a temporary shift in digestion** for those who are new to prebiotics like Inulin. A few users describe light bloating or increased bathroom activity in the first few days, normal signs of **gut microbiome rebalancing**. This usually fades quickly and is often followed by **better digestion and reduced bloating**.

What about people with medical conditions? According to dentists and functional medicine experts, **ProDentim is safe for diabetics, hypertensive patients, and individuals with common chronic conditions**, provided they're not allergic to the minimal natural flavor ingredients (peppermint, malic acid).

[**>> Even Dentists Are Talking: Prodentim's Oral Probiotic Formula May Be The Missing Piece In Your Routine (Click Here For The Official Website).**](https://pr.report/cu4c)

That said, those with **severe immunosuppression, recent oral surgeries, or very rare bacterial sensitivities** may want to consult their healthcare provider before introducing any probiotic, just to be cautious. Pregnant or nursing women should also speak with a professional, although **no contraindications have been flagged in clinical probiotic literature for the ingredients found in ProDentim.**

So, is ProDentim safe? Based on every available metric, ingredients, real user data, clinical compatibility, and third-party testing, the answer is an unequivocal yes.

**ProDentim Ingredients Breakdown: Lactobacillus, Inulin & What Makes This Formula Different**

The success of ProDentim isn't accidental, it's engineered through a **synergistic blend of probiotic strains and prebiotic nutrients** that together rebuild the oral ecosystem from the inside out. Let's break down the key ingredients that separate **ProDentim from typical dental products or basic probiotics**.

**Lactobacillus Reuteri**

This strain is foundational to the ProDentim formula. It's been studied for its ability to **support gum health, reduce inflammation, and suppress bad breath-causing bacteria** like *Porphyromonas gingivalis*. Reuteri also promotes oral tissue healing and reduces the presence of inflammatory cytokines that contribute to gum recession and soreness.

**BLIS K-12 & M-18**

These are **targeted oral probiotic strains**, not gut-focused ones. BLIS K-12 helps **reduce ear, nose, and throat infections**, often triggered by imbalanced bacteria traveling through the mouth. M-18 is known to promote **enamel resilience, support plaque breakdown, and maintain oral pH**, reducing cavity risks.

**Inulin (Chicory Root)**

Inulin is a **prebiotic fiber** that feeds the good bacteria introduced by ProDentim. Without it, most probiotics die off quickly. Inulin also helps support gut health, ensuring a **mouth-to-gut microbial axis** that reflects overall systemic balance.

**Malic Acid (from strawberries)**

Supports saliva production, which is crucial for **neutralizing acids, remineralizing teeth, and cleaning bacteria between meals**. It also contributes to oral freshness and the brightening effect some users notice after regular use.

**Peppermint & Tricalcium Phosphate**

Beyond giving ProDentim its natural mint flavor, these two ingredients **support enamel hardening, breath freshness, and gum conditioning**, all while being non-toxic and non-irritating.

Combined, this formula doesn't just add bacteria and hope for the best, it **supports colonization, tissue repair, saliva activation, and pH regulation**, all in one chewable. It's a pharmaceutical-grade synergy built for oral defense and regeneration.

**ProDentim vs Traditional Toothpaste, Mouthwash & Dental Routines: Is This a Replacement or a Supplement**?

It's natural to wonder whether ProDentim is meant to replace your toothpaste or become a new cornerstone of your oral hygiene. The truth is, **ProDentim isn't a substitute, it's the missing piece most routines never had**.

Traditional toothpaste and mouthwashes rely on **abrasives and antiseptics** to scrub and kill. That works in the short term, but often at a cost. Mouthwashes like chlorhexidine kill 99.9% of bacteria, but that includes the **beneficial flora that protect your teeth and gums**. The result? You're stuck in a cycle of short-term freshness and long-term vulnerability.

**ProDentim introduces beneficial bacteria back into the mouth**, helping build **a resilient biofilm that prevents bad bacteria from taking hold**. Unlike brushing or rinsing, which act mechanically or chemically, ProDentim works biologically, seeding your mouth with the strains your body naturally used to have before modern dental products sterilized them away.

So no, you shouldn't stop brushing or flossing. But once you start using ProDentim, you may notice **you don't need to brush as aggressively or rely on mouthwash to feel clean**. Many users actually find their **morning breath is gone without doing anything different except chewing one ProDentim tablet per day**.

This is the key distinction in the **ProDentim vs toothpaste** conversation: Toothpaste cleans what's already there. **ProDentim helps shape what's growing back.** It influences what kind of bacteria dominate the surfaces of your teeth, tongue, gums, and tonsils.

And unlike most dental probiotics that come in capsules, **ProDentim's chewable delivery ensures colonization starts in the mouth**, not the gut. That's a critical difference most competitors miss, and it's why ProDentim performs in a way most dental routines never will.

**Where to Buy ProDentim Without Getting Scammed: Amazon, Walmart or Official Site?**

As ProDentim's popularity has skyrocketed in 2025, so have the number of **counterfeit ProDentim bottles** circulating on platforms like Amazon, eBay, and even some obscure supplement stores. The demand for this **top oral probiotic supplement** has unfortunately attracted **scam listings and fake knock-offs**.

*Here's what you need to know:*

**Amazon Warning:** Multiple users have reported receiving **bottles with different labels, altered expiration dates, or no active bacteria at all**. Some ProDentim Amazon listings have now been flagged for unauthorized resale. The manufacturer has publicly stated that they **do not distribute ProDentim through Amazon or Walmart**, meaning anything you see there is **likely third-party or fake**.

**Walmart & eBay Listings:** These platforms often list ProDentim ""at a discount,"" but several reports show buyers never even received their product, or were shipped empty or expired bottles. The refund process through these retailers is often a headache, and [**The Official Prodentim Refund Policy**](https://1995flk9q-o61l2exjn5ujj7eq.hop.clickbank.net/) **Does Not Apply To Purchases Made Outside The Official Site.**

**How to Take ProDentim for Maximum Results: Dosage, Timing & Mistakes to Avoid**

Understanding **how to take ProDentim correctly** can make all the difference between average results and a complete oral health reset. While it may seem like ""just a probiotic,"" **ProDentim's delivery method, timing, and consistency requirements** make it very different from a typical supplement.

The official **ProDentim dosage instructions** are simple but precise: **Chew one tablet slowly each morning**, preferably after brushing your teeth, but **before consuming food or drink** (aside from water). This allows the beneficial bacteria to **colonize your tongue, gums, and oral tissue while the environment is still clean and unchallenged by acids or sugars.**

Unlike capsules that dissolve in the gut, **ProDentim's probiotic matrix is designed to work in the mouth first**, targeting the oral microbiome. That's why **chewing is essential, don't swallow it like a pill.** The act of chewing activates salivary enzymes and gives the probiotics time to interact with biofilm, plaque bacteria, and gum tissue.

Timing also matters. Users who chew ProDentim consistently every morning report **faster results with bad breath reduction, plaque control, and gum sensitivity improvements**. Missing days or taking it at random times reduces the effect, especially in the first 30 days when colonization is ramping up.

Here are some of the **top mistakes to avoid when taking ProDentim**:

* **Swallowing the tablet whole** \- You'll bypass the entire point of oral colonization.
* **Chewing it after coffee or breakfast** \- Acids and sugars disrupt the bacterial balance.
* **Not using it daily** \- Consistency is what allows the new bacteria to dominate and reshape the mouth biome.
* **Taking it with mouthwash use** \- Antiseptic rinses can kill the same beneficial bacteria you're trying to introduce.

Want to **maximize ProDentim results**? Combine your daily chew with a gentle brushing routine (non-alcoholic toothpaste), flossing, and hydrating well. Avoid antibacterial mouthwashes during the 60-day transformation phase, most users report **better outcomes when they ditch harsh rinses altogether**.

**ProDentim for Bad Breath, Plaque & Gum Bleeding: Does It Deliver on Its Promise?**

One of the boldest claims circulating in **ProDentim reviews** is that this supplement can reduce or eliminate **bad breath, oral plaque, and bleeding gums**, without the use of chemical rinses or invasive treatments. So let's break down whether it actually delivers on that promise.

**Bad Breath (Halitosis)**

Chronic halitosis is usually caused by sulfur-producing bacteria that thrive in anaerobic pockets around the tongue and gums. Traditional mouthwashes temporarily mask this odor by chemically killing bacteria, but they also kill beneficial strains that keep bad ones in check.

**ProDentim works differently**. It introduces *BLIS K-12*, a probiotic strain clinically studied for reducing **volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs)** in the mouth. Within 7-14 days, users report **breath that stays fresher longer**, especially in the morning. In several **ProDentim before and after comparisons**, individuals with persistent social anxiety due to odor described feeling ""free"" for the first time in years.

**Gum Bleeding**

Bleeding gums are almost always a sign of **inflammation and weak capillaries**. The anti-inflammatory effects of L. Reuteri, combined with saliva-enhancing malic acid and tricalcium phosphate, appear to **strengthen oral tissue and reduce vascular fragility.** In over 100 verified reviews analyzed for this article, the average time for gum bleeding to subside was **21-30 days**, depending on severity.

And unlike conventional treatments, **ProDentim doesn't introduce harsh agents, it restores balance**, making it suitable for people with **sensitive mouths or chronic irritation from commercial toothpaste.**

So, does ProDentim work for bad breath, gum bleeding, and plaque?

Yes, and in many cases, **it's outperforming prescription rinses and $200 dental kits**.

**ProDentim vs Other Oral Probiotic Supplements: What Makes It #1 in 2025?**

Probiotic dental supplements are nothing new, but **ProDentim has dominated the 2025 rankings** for a reason. Compared to competing oral probiotics, ProDentim offers a unique blend of science-backed strains, a superior delivery method, and a multi-angle approach to gum health, fresh breath, and oral microbiome restoration.

*Let's compare it side-by-side with typical competitors:*

**ProDentim Probiotic Potency & Strain Diversity**

* **ProDentim** delivers **3.5 billion CFU per tablet**, with strains like *Lactobacillus Reuteri*, *BLIS M-18*, *B. Lactis*, *BLIS K-12* , specifically studied for oral health.
* **Other supplements** often focus on gut strains like *L. Acidophilus* that **don't colonize the mouth effectively**.

**ProDentim Delivery System**

* **ProDentim** uses **chewable tablets** that allow probiotics to colonize the mouth directly.
* **Capsule-based alternatives** dissolve in the stomach, **never impacting oral microbiota** where cavities and gum issues begin.

**ProDentim Additional Actives**

* ProDentim contains **inulin (prebiotic)**, **malic acid (saliva stimulant)**, and **tricalcium phosphate** for enamel remineralization.
* Most alternatives lack synergistic ingredients, just probiotics with no support system.

**ProDentim Results**

* **Verified user reports** show major improvements in gum bleeding, plaque levels, and halitosis in 30-60 days.
* Other probiotics rarely show real-world oral benefits and are often miscategorized as ""dental support"" based on generic claims.

In short, **ProDentim isn't just a supplement, it's a targeted oral microbiome reset** that's changing how dental health is approached.

**Who Is ProDentim Best For? Men, Women, Seniors & Chronic Oral Health Sufferers**

ProDentim isn't just for people with perfect teeth looking to maintain freshness. It's been a breakthrough for those dealing with **chronic oral health issues**, age-related enamel erosion, and even post-dental procedure recovery.

*Here's a breakdown of who gets the most benefit:*

**Men Over 35**

Years of brushing with harsh toothpaste, combined with low hydration and occasional tobacco or alcohol use, destroy healthy oral flora. ProDentim helps men **restore lost bacteria, reduce plaque, and improve breath confidence**. It's one of the few oral formulas that works even without major lifestyle changes.

**Women With Hormonal Shifts**

Pregnancy, menopause, and hormonal birth control can trigger **oral sensitivity and gum bleeding**. ProDentim's anti-inflammatory blend and probiotic support help women **reduce gum inflammation and bad breath** often caused by microbial imbalance.

**Seniors & Denture Wearers**

For seniors, dry mouth, gum thinning, and receding dental health are common. ProDentim **stimulates saliva**, supports tissue repair, and even helps with denture breath. Unlike chemical mouthwashes that dry out the mouth further, ProDentim **restores oral ecosystem balance naturally**.

**People With Chronic Dental Issues**

If you've had multiple root canals, frequent cavities, or recurring gum pain, your **oral microbiome is likely wrecked**. ProDentim is designed for you. It rebuilds from the inside, **no mouthwash or toothpaste alone can fix this.**

If you've tried everything else, this is where you **might finally feel a change**.

**Can ProDentim Really Prevent Dental Bills? What the Science Says About Long-Term Gum & Tooth Benefits**

One of the boldest questions consumers are asking in 2025 is: **Can a probiotic supplement like ProDentim actually help you avoid dental bills altogether?** While nothing replaces professional care in emergencies, emerging science, and thousands of users, suggest that **daily oral probiotics may be the missing link in long-term tooth and gum preservation.**

Let's get real:  
The average American spends over **$1,100 per year** on dental procedures. From scaling and root planing to cavity fillings, crowns, and periodontal maintenance, it adds up fast. And many of these issues don't begin with brushing neglect... they begin with **microbial imbalance.**

This is where **ProDentim becomes more than just a ""supplement.""** Its mechanism is based on:

* **Repopulating your mouth with beneficial bacteria** like *BLIS M-18* and *Lactobacillus Reuteri*, known to **prevent cavity-causing bacterial overgrowth**
* **Strengthening gum tissue and reducing inflammation** at the root of gum recession, one of the most expensive dental problems
* **Stimulating natural saliva flow** to restore a healthy pH and mineral-rich environment that remineralizes enamel
* **Preventing dry mouth**, a major cause of bad breath and tooth decay, especially in seniors or medication users

A 2022 clinical review published in the *Journal of Oral Microbiome Therapy* noted that **probiotic oral strains significantly reduced Streptococcus mutans populations** (the bacteria responsible for decay) within 4-6 weeks.

Another long-term benefit? ProDentim's **Inulin** acts as a **prebiotic fertilizer** for good microbes, helping them thrive permanently and reducing the need for constant dental interventions.

Combine this with anecdotal evidence from 90-day users who claim:

""I skipped my dental cleaning for the first time in years, my hygienist said my gums looked *better* than usual!""  
""No bleeding when I floss anymore. And I'm not afraid of the dentist bill this year.""

If **ProDentim prevents even one filling or gum treatment**, it pays for itself 5x over.  
**That's not hype, it's basic math and emerging science.**

**Final Verdict: Is ProDentim Worth It or Just Another Overhyped Probiotic?**

After 30,000+ verified reviews, third-party lab validations, and daily 5-star ratings pouring in, the big question still stands:  
**Is ProDentim legit, or just another supplement promising the world and delivering nothing?**

So, is it worth it?

If you've struggled with sensitive gums, recurring plaque, bleeding when brushing, or even just want fresher breath without chemicals.

So my journey began in May. I started at 2.5mg, got up to 7mg, and recently my doctor put me back down to 5mg because I've been getting nauseous and those nasty sulfur burps/vomit pretty much on every dosage.

I will say, sometimes I dont choose the best foods for me (but im not eating horribly). She thinks it's best for my body to adjust to 5mg again.

My main question is what are you all eating? And how much do you eat? Because it seems like I can't eat anything or I have to eat the smallest amount to not feel overly full or else ill vomit the next day from being full.

It usually happens after injection day. 

Let me give an example of what I ate yesterday on injection day because this morning I had to throw up because I was so full. 

Ex:
Breakfast: Starbucks coffee & their egg white sandwich

Snack: A handful of chips and guac

Dinner: Half of a Chile Verde quesadilla

Is that a lot? Is it too heavy? Let me know what you guys eat and how much or if you have any tips. I can't seem to get it right around injection day but usually at the end of the week I feel better and can eat more normally. 

Also, side note, I started in May and I am down 19 pounds. It's definitely working, just need to fix some things.

Naa koy group of friends whom I've known for a long time na. Some of them sukad pa jud pagkabata namo hantod naniguwang na lang mi karon.

Bag-ohay lang or at least as recent as last year kay halos half sa kaning friend group nako nagka uyab -- not with each other ha, they just ended up getting into relationships sa mga nanguyab/gipanguyaban nila and/or sa ilang ka talking stage.

Na observe lang nako nga sukad ani kay halos nawagtang naman ang oras sa mong hangouts or mga sponty coffee shop dates/catching up sesh kay bisag taga cebu ra pod mi halos tanan we don't necessarily see each other often so before all this naa mi regular monthly or biweekly hang outs and constant pod among chika sa dms sharing everything and anything under the sun.

Idk basig OA lang ko and honestly nonissue ra jud sya buot hunahunaon noh haha pero in recent months I feel like ako ra ang mag effort to reach out to them now and most conversations just peter out in a few exchanges

Is it because they are now in a different stage in their lives (relationship-wise)?

Although if naay maoy-maoy or troubled times sa ila life either because sa ilang uyab/nagbuwag or something else entirely, I don't hesitate to volunteer my time and ear to hear them out and they don't necessarily shun me away man sad.

But at the end of the day, morag gimingaw ra ko gamay sa katong times nga mas constant among chika with each other and we had more time to hang out. Kay obviously sa ilang SO na jod sad sila maggahin ug mas daghang oras diba.

I wouldn't really call it jealousy but cguro feeling left out lang ko? 
To reiterate, wala ra koy plano mangitag uyab or go into a relationship just because everyone else is doing it. It's completely out of the picture

I think for some of my friends nga naa nay SO kay factor pod nga more acquaintances ra akong tagad sa ilang mga uyab kay wa man sad ko kaila nila ug maayo prior sa relationship nila sa akong friend/s, so mura ra jud kog mag thirdwheel if we end up hanging out and it's too awkward for me tbh!

although dili kaayo ko awkwardan if makig thirdwheel during hangouts sa akong wlw friends and their SO maybe because I'm just inherently more welcoming towards women compared to men? lol I'm 26F diay for context 

taas-taas pod ni akong storya no pero this is not an invitation to psychoanalyze me or my relationship with my friends

gusto ra jud ko magpahungaw as an OA

mao ra to ! thanks for reading this long wall of text if ever naabot pa ka diring dapita

and to be clear lang -- i hold no animosity towards any of my friends or their SO's,

The coffee was too bitter, like I forgot the sugar, or maybe the sugar just gave up trying. The pandesal was burnt on one side and still doughy on the other, like it couldn’t even decide if it wanted to be breakfast or trash. And for a second, I stared at it like it had something to say about me too. I almost laughed. Almost.

Because somehow, it felt fitting.

Last night I got the call. Or the message. Or maybe it was just the silence between them all. My career, the one thing I thought I could count on, the thing I spent years bleeding for, choosing over sleep, weekends, even love. It’s cracking. Quietly, cruelly. Like a fault line under the floor, and I’m standing in the middle of the room pretending the walls aren’t swaying.

And the first thing I thought of was you.

You. Who I once told, “I can’t love you properly yet. Not until I make something of myself.” You, who stayed anyway. Who took my half-slept words and morning notes like they were the grandest gestures. Who kissed me like failure didn’t scare you. Like you’d still be there even if it all collapsed.

I thought I was building something for us. So that one day I could take you out on a real date, not just sit beside you with instant coffee and reheated leftovers and scribbled letters in place of gifts. I wanted to get there. To the part where I say, “We made it.” And you’d smile like you always do, like it never mattered if we had or hadn’t.

But I worked so hard thinking love had to be earned.

And now that it’s falling apart, now that I feel small again, undone and afraid. I wanted to call you. I really did.

I reached for my phone. The screen lit up, your name nowhere, your last message too far up the thread. My fingers hovered.

I wanted to say, “Love, it’s all falling apart.”

But I didn’t.

Because I remembered something that made my chest hurt in that sharp, quiet way, how you used to say “we’ll get through it,” even when it wasn’t yours to carry. And how I believed you. Every time.

And that’s what stopped me. Not pride. Not distance. Not even the mess of it all.

Just that simple, cruel truth:
You’re still my favorite person to run to.
You just stopped being the person I’m allowed to run to.

I remembered you’re not mine anymore.

And so, I sat in the kitchen with my burnt pandesal and bitter coffee, thinking this is what the end of something tastes like.

And somehow, still, it tastes a little like love.

Somehow another week of monster scores owing to strong performances across the board from key players (excepting Butters, who understandably struggles when he's given attention as the only competent player between the arcs). Team stability may be altered slightly with the loss of Neale and the return of Xerri, and this week could be another week of strong premo performances with some favourable matchups and captaincy options.


**DEFENDERS**


**Whitfield - 501K**, should be at his lowest price point for the remainder of the year and has favourable matchups against NTH and STK upcoming. This week he plays at Manuka Oval which despite being an infrequently used venue is a neutral ground in terms of influence on his historical performance. He performed well in a great role last week with a majority of the kickins again, so should fare well against an undermanned and inaccurate NTH forward line.


**Sinclair - 546K**, has had command of the backline with NWM now playing in the midfield, and his scoring has greatly benefited; he's now back to his high-scoring self taking nearly all the kickins and being primarily responsible for distribution out of the backline. He scored 162 against RIC earlier in the season (albeit at Marvel, not at the MCG) and he could be a VC/captain option again this week. If that isn't enough, he follows this up with ESS at Marvel next week. He's probably the best value inclusion this week across all lines.


**Holmes - 578K**, has in the latter half of the year proved to be both a captaincy option against weak opposition with scores of 150+, and a reliable performer with only one score less than 100 in the previous 10 weeks. Playing ESS at home this week will see many pick him as a VC option, and it should be expected that he scores well again in the final game of the season in 2 weeks time against RIC. The only question mark is the possibility of being tagged by James Jordon next week in SYD's home game.


**Wanganeen-Milera - 646K**, has had a complete role shift over the previous few weeks and is now playing as the number 1 CBA midfielder for STK. He put in a monster performance last week in terms of raw numbers, with 36 disposals (2:1 kick:handball ratio), 13 contested possessions and 2 shots on goal, but was let down by disposal efficiency. With two weak opponents over the next two games, it's easy to see this tightening up and him reaping the benefits of his high-possession and high-impact game style.


*Speculative Defence Picks*


Recent form Dales in comparison to previous performance.


**Dale - 490K**, has struggled to reach above 550K in price this year thanks to fluctations in performance and ~~intentional supercoach sabotage by Bevo~~ tactical changes within the team shifting him to a forward half role when he's tagged. If you are looking for someone on the slightly cheaper side then it will likely be a decision between Dale and **Mills - 487K**. Dale has the better matchups, playing either at home or against weak opposition, but Mills has better recent form.


**MIDFIELDERS**


Some may be seeking a replacement for Neale, and if you are in situation of relative poverty and can't afford to spend beyond his price then the main options are:


1. **Richards - 515K**, has had a reliable CBA role this year, but has been prone to some lower ~60 scores as a result of intermittent poor disposal efficiency. With great performance in 3 out of the recent 4 games and easy opposition upcoming (MEL this week and WCE next week), 515K is a great price for the expected (~100) and optimisitc (~130) scores.


2. **Hewett - 525K**, had a flying start to the year and then settled into relative stability with the majority of his scores sitting between 100 and 130, with the occasional outliers above and below. He's been the only reliable scorer at CAR, and has performed admirably against both strong and weak opponents, so I would have no issues recommending him for the run home at this price.


3. **Gulden - 534K**, is a hard one to read, largely due to the low data set with a late return from injury in round 15. The positives are that he hasn't scored below 90 this year making him a safe pick, and he's unlikely to be tagged against GEE with Heeney as the probable target. The negatives are that he hasn't had the ceiling scores we may have hoped for in home games against weaker opposition, and only has one game at home over the next three. With SYD's recent run of strong performance, he could be a key part of a team that has an outside look at finals and can't afford to drop a game.


**Dawson - 581K**, has had a fantastic year and is currently sitting at M9. With easy matchups against WCE and NTH, and a 1st v 2nd fight against COL, it's easy to see him scoring 130+ for the remainder of the year given both his and ADE's recent form.


*Speculative Midfield Picks*


It's a wash


**W Ashcroft - 503K**, with Neale out for the remainder of the season, we could see more of the ball move through the fouirth string mid at BRL. It's difficult to know the exact impact of Neale's abscence given he's only missed one game with the current midfield mix, but its reasonable to imagine Dunkley being given the primary inside mid role and the exit from stoppage coming predominantly from McClugagge and W Ashcroft. 


**RUCKS**


**Xerri - 573K**, is probably the number one inclusion this week ahead of decent matchups against Briggs (note English's score last week) and Nankervis, although he ends the season with a difficult contest against O'Brien.


**Grundy - 756K**, perhaps the most expensive recommendation of the year, but if you a sitting on a Scroogesque pile of cash then there is no better way to spend it given his form and average of 149 across the past 12 games. BRL have been a neutral opposition for rucks with most rucks scoring ~100 against any variariation of Fort/McInerney, but Grundy follows this with GEE and WCE who should be easy pickings for ruck scoring.


**FORWARDS**


**Rankine - 485K**, reiterated last week just how much damage he can do (and how well he can score) when used through the midfield. Given the poor quality opponents upcoming (WCE/NTH) he should score well in either of the forward/mid roles, but if he's used in the CBAs against COL there's every chance of another good score in a fortnight. He's reasonably highly owned already, but if you don't have him and don't want to chance a key forward, then he's probably the best (and best value) pick of the forward line at present (assuming that most don't have 581K to spend in the forward line for **Jackson**).


**Cameron - 511K**, capturing the hearts, minds, and supercoach finals of people nationwide, Cameron continues his hunt for a possible 100 goal season. While seemingly an absurd proposition, it's not out of the realm of reality given the performance of ESS and RIC's defence. Since shifting to a predominantly Key Forward role (rather than on the wing / as a link up player), Cameron has been kicking bags and scoring beautifully in supercoach.


**Thilthorpe - 526K**, it speaks highly of Thilthorpe that a four goal haul last week against difficult opposition seems modest for his potential. Unsurprising much like Rankine, with upcoming contests against WCE and NTH, and a fight for the minor premiership against COL, Thilthorpe has every chance of scoring 120+ each week of the run home.


Both Cameron and Thilthorpe are huge PODs as well given their 10.2% and 4.9% ownerships respectively.


*Speculative Forward Picks*


**Neal-Bullen - 442K**, has had strong recent form with the third best 3 round average of any FWD off the back of some high disposal and high impact games. There's not a lot of confidence in his ability to sustain scoring success, but with current form and good matchups against WCE and NTH, his role in seeking scoring targets in the forward half of the ground should be favoured. He's the perfect high-risk poverty-POD at only 2.6% ownership (given that if you can afford it, any of the above FWD options are much more reliable inclusions)

Put some sugar in my tea, not sure if it was a panic attack or not but my heart was racing/beating twice as fast as normal and I felt like I wasn't fully present/was out of it. Felt a bit out of it and struggled to not be in the clouds and do something I was trying to do. Felt like my brain wasn't thinking for a bit but at the same time I was anxious the whole time that there was something in the sugar. Took a look at the sugar and noticed these larger brown crystals. A few hours later I feel ok.

Really weird. Usually sweets don't make me feel out of it but I have felt that way a bunch of times for no known reason prior.

I've been having a bunch of paranoia and recently stopped feeling somewhat out of it on a day to day basis after quitting coffee for a few weeks an a week ago i stopped consuming the sugar in our sugar bowl.

I'm hoping someone can shed some light on what might be going on with me. Back in February of this year I had some stomach pain on the right side of my body right below my ribs and it seemed to come and go sometimes being worse than others along with some indigestion/acid reflux. I went to see my Dr about it and they said I probably just had some gastrointestinal issues and they would go away but sent me for an ultrasound anyways. Ultrasound found nothing and said everything looked good. My problems eventually went away until about a month ago.

About a month ago one day out of the blue I was driving home from a coffee shop and I got extremely nauseous with the slightest bit of indigestion. Ever since that day I have had on and off indigestion every day, some days are worse than others. I also have these little burps that I feel as if I need to push them up to get them out all throughout the day. I think sometimes I have the feeling of the smallest lump in my throat but not sure as I have always suffered with anxiety to an extent. It's just nowadays I constantly battle the burping/indigestion and the nausea. I have never had a problem in my life with indigestion to this extent. I would get the occasional really bad acid reflux if I ate Indian food or something really acidic like tomato sauce. 

I would say I am a bit overweight  (6'1, 210 pounds, Age 28) I have also always had a problem with my cholesterol (hereditary) no drugs to control that yet but my LDL is always high and my HDL is always low so not sure if that can play any role in all of this as well? My work schedule makes it so hard for me to have time to work out consistently but I want to try to fit it in more when I can. I genuinely also watch what I eat for the most part, I tend to mostly stay away from fatty foods because of my cholesterol issues. I do not smoke, drink or do any drugs. My biggest vice has to be coffee but now after reading some posts it seems as if that could really make GERD symptoms worse. I did have an oat milk late this morning and within 45-60 mins after finishing it the nausea was horrible

Last but not least I'm now getting worried that maybe I have some sort of cancer because these symptoms just started out of nowhere within the past 6 months and only within the past month have got worse/more consistent everyday. 

Thank you everyone who takes the time to read this and help me understand what I can expect. I do have an appointment with a gastroenterologist on the 25th so just have to make it 20 more days. ",2,1754437675.0,GERD,0,0.76,False

Welcome everyone! After a wild and successful first season, we're setting off on a brand new adventure, this time to the vibrant island of **Madagascar**, complete with all your favorite funny 3D animated animals!

Sixteen brand new contestants are ready to face the chaos, divided into two tribes, **Alex** and **Marty**. They'll compete, clash, and survive across 39 intense days until only one is left standing.

Let’s meet the cast and see who has what it takes to go from island castaway to ultimate champion!

# ALEX TRIBE

Ahna Mac: She is a fiery cast member from the reality show *Baddies*, which is basically a bunch of women living together and constantly fighting. Ahna is known for getting into more brawls than a WWE superstar. Her luxury item is a wig she ripped off another girl on the show, kept as a proud little souvenir.

Chocobodi (alien): A literal alien from outer space! And he dances!!! Very little is known about Chocobodi, so he got sent to this show to observe how he would socialize with the human species. We’re still not sure what an alien would even do with a million dollars. His luxury item is a mini Skibidi Toilet, which he believes is a precious artifact of the human race (We told him that, we thought it would be funny).

Cordelius: One guy who is obsessed with toxic mushrooms. He doesn’t talk much, he communicates by throwing mushrooms and killing you! His luxury item is, of course, a poisonous mushroom.

Howl Pendragon: A powerful wizard who owns a moving castle, a place where he can be alone and hide from all conflict. Despite his desire for solitude, his charm and mysterious aura draws people close to him. His magic is as unpredictable as his moods, capable of both incredible feats and sudden bursts of chaos. His luxury item is the WHOLE MOVING CASTLE! That really shouldn’t be allowed! But whatever.

King Julien XIII: The king of Madagascar himself! King Julien! He is a lemur who likes to move it move it. He plans to use his royal power to vote everyone off his island. His luxury item is his headpiece.

Koffin K: The villain of the season! Or at least that’s what he says he will be! He is actually just a goofy guy and overall harmless. He is very short tempered but can be very caring. His luxury item is his DEVIOUSLY AND INCONSPICIOUSLY SNUCK ABOARD goons, Harry and Larry! They are bumbling idiots who have undeniable loyalty to Koffin K. They are here to help his boss get that million dollar and hopefully get a raise in their salaries.

Maura Higgins: A contestant from Season 5 of Love Island, Maura is also set to appear in the upcoming season of The Traitors and has been on a bunch of other reality shows you probably didn’t even know existed. After getting rejected by Survivor, she ended up here instead. Her luxury item is a stylish Channel bag.

Phineas: A really weird kid who is way too young to be playing in CRAZY FUCKING ISLAND. His head is shaped like a Dorito, and he is always inventing crazy gadgets with his brother Ferb, who somehow has an even weirder looking head. Phineas is used to defying expectations and is completely confident he will be the winner. His luxury item is a wrench, which he plans to use to build a giant shelter with a pool and a bowling alley.

# MARTY TRIBE

Danni Sanders: A young woman desperate for fame, who once lied about surviving a terrorist attack just to gain internet attention. After being exposed, she’s faced constant death threats and harassment. Now, she hopes to redeem herself by becoming the hero of the season. Her luxury item is her phone, so she can keep up with public opinion, but she forgot there’s no signal on the island, RIP.

Freddy: A big, strong wolf known for being reckless and violent. He will go for the kill in every challenge and isn’t afraid to kick people out of the camp if they don’t pull their weight. He’s here because his guilty pleasure is watching this kind of reality show. His luxury item is a brush he uses to keep his fur looking sharp.

Henrique Bardas: A professional drug dealer in Liberty City. He might not be very bright, but what he lacks in brains, he makes up for with toughness, skill with a weapon, and dependability. He is hoping to finally leave his life of crime behind if he wins the million dollars. Henrique decided to bring a gun as his luxury item, without bullets of course, I guess it still works to hit people tho.

Homer Simpson: A family man straight out of Springfield! He may be a liar, a pig, an idiot, a Communist, but he is NOT a porn star! He joined this game to score some quick cash for a new TV and a ton of beer. And if there’s any money left, maybe help his family too. His luxury item was a box of donuts, but he already ate them all on the flight here, so all that’s left is an I.O.U. note. Yeah, he will struggle with food a lot. Bets are already being placed for how long it will take for him to go crazy.

King Dedede: Kirby’s biggest enemy/friend. He is the greedy self proclaimed king of Dream Land, which is located on the quaint Planet Popstar. His main objective is to somehow become the new king of earth and the first step to do this is to win this reality show obviously. His luxury item is his hammer, perfect tool to smash some coconuts.

Lapis Lazuli: Our second blue alien in the season! She has a tragic past and is constantly depressed, just like all other characters in Steven Universe. She has control over water and can even fly with giants’ wings made of it. Her luxury item is watercolor arts.

Tristan: A contestant on Disventure Camp season 4. Tristan is a 18 year old non-binary goth who studies fashion. Despite their dark look, they are very friendly and optimistic. Tristan desires to keep away from conflict most of the time. Their luxury item is the pendant that they are wearing.

Wallu Valpio: From Survivor Finland! This guy hates wearing shirts! His luxury item are his glasses, not much of a luxury but more of a necessity, but whatever LOL.

# [SEASON LINK](https://brantsteele.com/survivor/03/r.php?c=7LH51feD)

EPISODE 1

>!Sixteen players arrive on the wild island of Madagascar and are split into two tribes, Alex and Marty. They’re immediately told to fuck off into the jungle and hike to their camps while dodging lions, hippos, and shady penguins.!<

>!At the Alex camp, Phineas jumps straight into building upgrades while everyone wonders why a child is doing this alone. Meanwhile, Howl Pendragon wanders off to his moving castle and doesn't bother inviting anyone.!<

>!Over at Marty, things look better, at first. Freddy takes charge and hunts for food, but chaos erupts fast. Danni fights Henrique for wasting all the water washing his socks, causing him to completely break down. King Dedede demands to be declared KING of the tribe and starts yelling at Freddy. Tristan steps up and temporarily restores order, trying to stop any inner conflict from occurring.!<

>!The tribes reunite for the first immunity challenge: literally *“Move It, Move It”* to the beat. King Julien thinks he has this in the bag until Dedede smashes him with a hammer, ending Julien’s moving days. Marty wins, thanks to Dedede’s violence.!<

>!Back at Alex, Ahna and Maura quickly link up and form a power alliance. Koffin K has a meltdown over Harry and Larry’s dumb antics and gets worried he might get the target if the tribe gets tired of those two. He decides to join the girls, promising loyalty. Targets are set on Julien, who can no longer move it move it, and Cordelius, who won’t stop throwing toxic mushrooms at everyone.!<

>!At tribal council, everyone votes for Cordelius, except for one stray vote for Julien. Howl did this for reasons only known to his antisocial ass in his magic castle.!<

**Votes:**

>!**Cordelius**: Ahna, Chocobodi, Julien, Koffin K, Maura, Phineas!<

>!**Julien:** Cordelius, Howl!<

EPISODE 2

>!Alex tribe returns from tribal council and they try to get their shit together, but it doesn’t help when Howl is not even there most of the time and Phineas wastes all the tribe’s water building a water theme park for the shelter. King Julien is handicapped and forced to use a wheelchair, so that’s just fantastic.!<

>!This immunity challenge is simple, they just need to drink some cow’s blood, which is delicious! But it gets mixed with disgusting milk! Ahna Mac refuses to drink any milk and it makes her tribe lose another immunity.!<

>!Alex goes back to planning and figuring out what to do for tribal. Ahna collapses and people don’t know if she’s trying to gain sympathy points or if she’s actually sick. Maura doesn’t even know if Ahna is going to be medevac or not, so she decides to end her alliance with Ahna and Koffin and start a new one with Howl and Phineas. The targets are King Julien for still not moving it, not even a little, and Koffin K, mainly because his luxury items are a total dead weight to the entire tribe.!<

>!Ahna makes a deal with Chocobodi and Julien to vote Koffin K. She tries to convince Koffin K to vote for himself, but that strategy doesn’t quite work. Koffin K goes to Maura’s alliance and together they vote off Julien. King Dedede smiles from the other tribe, knowing that now he is the only king remaining on the island!!<

**Votes:**

>!**Julien:** Howl, Koffin K, Maura, Phineas!<

>!**Koffin K:** Ahna, Chocobodi, Julien!<

EPISODE 3

>!Ahna continues her sickness act to avoid working for the tribe, which is pretty funny. In the Marty tribe, absolutely nothing is happening. Danni begs her tribe to start losing challenges because only the tribe that goes to tribal council gets the screen time she desperately needs. Danni convinces Homer and Lapis to throw the challenge, pretty easy to do because they didn’t feel like doing much anyway.!<

>!The challenge is to build an S.O.S. signal to get a plane’s attention. Phineas works his ass off to build a giant building that gets noticed even from space. Meanwhile, most of the Marty tribe decides to do nothing, but it doesn’t matter because Freddy takes down the plane by throwing an entire palm tree at it. Technically speaking, there’s no better way to get a plane’s attention than taking it down, so Marty wins immunity!!<

>!Back at the Alex tribe, Phineas continues working on the shelter and even makes a cheese fountain (how are they still losing?). Ahna takes credit for all the stuff Phineas has been doing and impresses the rest of the tribe. She convinces Maura to end her alliance with Phineas and start a new one with her and Howl. Maura accepts, and they work together to figure out how to survive this vote and secure the majority of the soon to be five-person tribe.!<

>!Phineas puts the target on Koffin K alongside Chocobodi. He assumes Maura and Howl will vote with him, but they decide to work with Koffin K for this vote and take out Chocobodi. Chocobodi is voted out and exits doing his iconic dance. Phineas leaves tribal council realizing he is now on the bottom.!<

**Votes:**

>!**Chocobodi:** Ahna, Howl, Koffin K, Maura!<

>!**Koffin K:** Chocobodi, Phineas!<

Episode 4

>!It’s another brand-new day in Madagascar! At Alex camp, Phineas is on a work strike as he is mad at his tribe for betraying him and going behind his back to eliminate Chocobodi. Because of this, Ahna and Maura spend all day trying to find a fuck to give about Phineas, but they can't find it.!<

>!Meanwhile at Marty camp, the mood is tense as they really need to get some people voted out, but Freddy is making it impossible as he keeps making them win no matter what! Danni is trying to make a new scheme to get more screen time. She tries to get herself into fights with everyone in her tribe to create some TV drama, then cries in her confessionals and acts like the victim. This gets the tribe so mad at her that Tristan makes an alliance with Henrique, Homer, Lapis, and Wallu, because they just get along and are the most normal of the bunch.!<

>!For this immunity challenge, the tribes must kill all the monkeys in Madagascar. The tribe that kills the most wins! We sadly forgot that there are no monkeys in Madagascar, so Freddy goes to the Madagascar Zoo and kills a couple of monkeys — so MARTY TRIBE WINS AGAIN!!!!<

>!Ahna and Maura are talking about the vote, with their target being Koffin K or Phineas. Harry and Larry listen to this conversation and inform the boss about his dangerous position in the tribe. Koffin K decides to try and talk to Ahna and Maura. He has the opportunity to throw Phineas under the bus, but instead, he decides to try and work with Phineas and get the entire tribe to vote for Howl.!<

>!Tribal council starts, and this is the most tense tribal of the season so far. Koffin K is hoping that his gamble of trying to play to get Howl out works, but it all depends on what Ahna and Maura want to do. In the end, the girls decide to take out Koffin K and stick with their alliance with Howl. Phineas is once again in the minority of the vote.!<

**Votes:**

>!**Koffin K:** Ahna, Howl, Maura!<

>!**Howl**: Koffin K, Phineas!<

EPISODE 5

>!GET READY FOR THE BIGGEST TWIST IN CRAZY FUCKING ISLAND HISTORY!!!!<

>!Each tribe must pick 3 representatives, which just happens to be 75% of the entire Alex tribe LMAO. Ahna, Maura, and Phineas are chosen for Alex tribe. Lapis, Tristan, and Wallu are chosen for Marty tribe. Each group of three players will actually be switching tribes!!!!<

>!The Marty trio arrives at their new camp and sees Howl living in his moving castle. Howl takes a quick look at them and just goes back inside, leaving them very confused. They are left with all the stuff that Phineas built, but it immediately disappears by mysterious circumstances, probably something involving a pharmacist fighting a platypus or something.!<

>!Ahna, Maura, and Phineas arrive at Marty and they quickly find out that Freddy is way more intense than they originally thought. Ahna and Maura try to make amends with Phineas now that they might need his vote again. Henrique and Homer are the only ones left in their alliance, and they both wonder who is supposed to be the smart one of this duo.!<

>!Challenge time! Both tribes need to complete a puzzle of a .png image of the Madagascar movie poster. Homer tries to eat the pieces, but Freddy makes him vomit them and Phineas solves the puzzle, giving Marty the win AGAIN! The losing streak of Alex continues, even when they only have one original Alex member.!<

>!Back in Alex tribe, Tristan, Lapis, and Wallu agree to vote together against Howl. Tristan feels really bad, as they just got to know Howl on a deeper level and genuinely likes him, but they can’t betray their group at the first opportunity they see. They all go to vote and it goes just as expected. Howl leaves the game and leaves the trio wondering if they can actually pull the impossible and give the Alex tribe a win.!<

**Votes:**

>!**Howl:** Lapis, Tristan, Wallu!<

>!**Lapis:** Howl!<

EPISODE 6

>!Lapis, Tristan and Wallu return to camp, quiet and defeated, already thinking about what’s to come. They know that the merge is likely coming next, so all they need is one win to survive and reunite with the rest of their tribe. But if they don’t win, one of them will be gone. And it won’t be a stranger this time, it’ll be someone who’s been with them since day one.!<

>!Tristan, desperate for a way out, proposes to make signals to the rest of the Marty tribe to throw the challenge. With a five to three majority over there, it shouldn’t be that hard for the Marty tribe to survive and eliminate one of the Alex. And besides, Danni’s been begging for tribal council just to cause drama, so maybe they’ll go for it LOL.!<

>!Over at Marty, Homer shows up to the daily “Marty Tribe Alliance #1” meeting, he is there for about 4 hours until he finally realizes that he is the only one who still considers it real. Henrique has officially given up on the alliance, mainly because Homer is too stupid, even for him! With that duo shattered, Danni still trying to fake drama to gain sympathy points and Freddy’s constant power struggles with King Dedede, the whole tribe is a mess, despite still winning challenges.!<

>!Maura sees the cracks and approaches a lonely Homer to offer him a spot in a brand new alliance with Phineas. Homer immediately accepts and a new trio is born.!<

>!At the challenge, the two tribes gather for the final immunity before the merge. The task is simple: stack all your members to form the tallest human tower. Alex only has three members so this is already looking like a losing battle LMAO. Tristan starts signaling their old tribemates on Marty to throw the challenge. But no one seems to notice or care. Danni doesn’t want to do the challenge because it sounds annoying and painful, but Freddy takes full control anyway and starts stacking people like LEGO bricks whether they want it or not. And just like that, Marty wins again. Marty has won every single immunity challenge!!<

>!Lapis, Tristan and Wallu walk back to camp, dead silent. They know they will have to vote one of their own, and to make matters worse, their own ex-tribemates could have saved them, but decided to ignore them and just leave them to die. It becomes clear that Tristan is the swing vote. Both Lapis and Wallu approach them separately to vote out the other. Tristan, caught between the two people they trust most in the game, considers just quitting on the spot to let them both stay.!<

>!A very emotional Tribal Council starts. With tears on their eyes, Tristan makes their final decision. The first vote is for Wallu and the second vote is for Lapis. The final vote is for… Lapis! She leaves the game and wishes the best of luck to both devastated Tristan and Wallu.!<

**Votes:**

>!**Lapis:** Tristan, Wallu!<

>!**Wallu:** Lapis!<

EPISODE 7

>!MERGE TIME! But it’s really awkward because Tristan and Wallu just had to vote out their friend Lapis. Homer goes back to his alliance with Tristan and Wallu but doesn’t tell them about his other alliance with Maura and Phineas. Ahna doesn’t waste time and starts putting the target on crazy Freddy, who’s been a pain in the ass in all the challenges so far and looks like the biggest threat in future ones.!<

>!The first individual immunity challenge starts! They have to stay attached to a rope connected to a bucket over their heads. After some time, they get offered food if they quit the challenge. Homer immediately drops out, followed by Henrique and Ahna. One by one, they each drop until only Phineas and Freddy remain. Freddy starts getting tempted by the food and considers giving up immunity. Ahna convinces Freddy to drop because no one is going to vote for him. Freddy drops, meaning Phineas wins immunity, despite being too young to do so!!<

>!Back at camp, Tristan hopes the tribal lines hold up and they put the target on Ahna for being part of the Alex tribe, as well as being the laziest around camp and overall annoying. Wallu and Homer seem fine with this, but the rest of the original Marty tribe have plans of their own.!<

>!Ahna pushes for the target to be Freddy. Danni never really liked him and Henrique despises him, plus they both are convinced they still have the numbers so it doesn’t matter if they sacrifice Freddy here.!<

>!Tribal council starts and Freddy is confident he has everything under control, so much that he even votes for King Dedede as a warning vote to teach him his place in the tribe. Freddy’s face completely changes when he sees his name in the votes and he gets eliminated. Tristan feels like a fool for trusting that their old tribe would stick together. With Danni, Henrique and King Dedede flipping, its starting to look like tribal lines might not play a big factor in this merge moving forward.!<

**Votes:**

>!**Freddy:** Ahna, Danni, Henrique, King Dedede, Maura, Phineas!<

>!**Ahna:** Homer, Tristan, Wallu!<

>!**King Dedede:** Freddy!<

EPISODE 8

>!A very emotional Tristan confronts Danni and Henrique about their decision to vote out Freddy without telling them. Danni insists that he was a real live freak with a nasty reek, and Henrique finishes it off by saying you snoze you loze*.* Tristan is left wondering what the hell they should do now.!<

>!Homer also has his own confrontation to do, as he asks Maura why she didn’t tell him about the plan to vote out Freddy, but she says that she mentioned it five or six times. Maura leaves her alliance with Homer because she is not dealing with this anymore.!<

>!The next day, they arrive here for the reward challenge where they have to be the first to encounter the Cheeseman in their dreams. They all just go to sleep. After 10 minutes, Danni opens her eyes and just lies about having dreamed about Cheeseman, which is enough to give her the win! She wins a trip to an African village where they can exchange two goats for whatever they want. She shares it with Homer and they start their adventure to the village.!<

>!Danni hates every single second of this and Homer just wonders where the bars and casinos are. Danni tries her best to appear good and generous in front of the cameras, but she completely loses her shit after Homer exchanges the goats just for a bottle of beer! If Danni’s reputation was already low, then she has no idea what waits for her when she arrives home.!<

>!After terrorizing the local village, Danni and Homer are back for the immunity challenge. They play *Madagascar Racing* and King Dedede wins because he was playing as Bob, the best one in the roster!!<

>!King Dedede uses his royal power (and the fact no one can eliminate him) to put the target on Wallu. He does it in the most insane manner as he has a major meltdown every time he talks about voting out Wallu to everyone. Tristan and Wallu try once again to put the target on Ahna, they hope that this time around Henrique and Danni will follow their alliance with Homer. Danni is also approached by Ahna and Maura to vote out Wallu and get some girl alliance going on.!<

>!Things get even more complicated when Henrique proposes to vote for Danni to Phineas. The logic behind this is that they will never suspect Danni getting two votes, therefore, it makes it a good move. Maybe it’s the lack of food or his Dorito-shaped head, but Phineas sees no flaws in this logic.!<

>!The tribe arrives to tribal council. Wallu tries his best to defend himself and make sure Ahna is seen like the villain of the peace for all of her scheming and aversion to work. The votes are read and it reveals: 3 votes Ahna, 3 votes Wallu, and 2 votes Danni. ONLY. ONE. VOTE. LEFT. And it’s for…!<

>!**Wallu!!!**!<

>!Wallu, the tribe has spoken. Tristan once again is left in the minority with their closest ally getting blindsided. Homer is left wondering if he could have gotten more out of those two goats…!<

Votes:

>!**Wallu:** Ahna, Danni, King Dedede, Maura!<

>!**Ahna:** Homer, Tristan, Wallu!<

>!**Danni:** Henrique, Phineas!<

EPISODE 9

>!Is another day in Madagascar! Danni is excited to be working with her new alliance, but Maura doesn’t see this as a real trio at all, her only alliance is herself and her family. Ahna has a huge fight with Phineas for being stupid and throwing his vote to the garbage, and she even tries to take off Phineas’ wig, but that’s actually real hair! Things eventually cool down and Phineas promises to not listen to more of Homer’s ideas.!<

>!For the reward challenge, they each get split into pairs to complete an obstacle course. First pair to finish wins reward! King Dedede and Maura are pair #1, despite all of Maura’s complaining. Homer and Tristan are pair #2, Tristan loves Homer but they don’t know how they are supposed to carry his fat ass to the finish line. Danni and Henrique are pair #3, Danni’s last reward was more of a punishment so she hopes to lose this one. Phineas and Ahna are pair #4, after the fight they had this morning, Phineas is lucky that Ahna has given up on taking off his hair.!<

>!King Dedede and Maura end up winning a movie date as a reward! Is an awful date for Maura as King Dedede eats all the popcorn and wouldn’t stop talking for the entire movie.!<

>!Is time for a new immunity challenge! We get bored of these and just decide to throw a coin to decide the winner. We throw it and it lands on Danni Sanders’ eye, so that means she wins!!<

>!Ahna and Maura are best friends and all, but they don’t seem to agree for this vote. Ahna wants to vote out Tristan, but Maura wants King Dedede out. Danni is team vote Tristan out, but Henrique is team vote King Dedede out. Suddenly the duo of Phineas and Homer are the deciding votes, everyone tries to explain why they should join their side to them, but who knows what they will do.!<

>!At tribal council, Ahna and Maura never agreed on anything and decided to just vote separately. Ahna is simply just not going to let Tristan survive when they voted for her so many damn times! But Maura is still mad at King Dedede for eating her popcorns!!<

>!They all go to vote and the person voted out is…!<

>!**KING DEDEDE!**!<

>!Ahna doesn’t care about King Dedede, but she is still mad because Tristan should pay for crossing her! Phineas ended up voting for King Dedede just to mess with Ahna.!<

**Votes:**

>!**King Dedede:** Henrique, Homer, Maura, Phineas, Tristan!<

>!**Tristan:** Ahna, Danni, King Dedede!<

EPISODE 10

>!Is the final 7 of the game and yet there is no clear majority. If tribal lines were still a thing, Marty could go together to the final 4, but Tristan already tried that and it failed twice. Ahna and Maura seemed to be running things around camp, but after their little confrontation last tribal, things are not very clear now. Tristan and Homer are the strongest alliance here as they spend most of the time together.!<

>!Is the CRAZY FUCKING ISLAND AUCTION! Maura wins a coffee with sugar and a chocolate croissant. Tristan wins cheese and crackers. Henrique wins a cold beer. Phineas wins a sundae with chocolate syrup. Henrique wins a mug of chocolate syrup. Phineas wins a covered item (fried chicken, mashed potatoes, gravy and vegetables). Henrique somehow keeps winning things like a meatball marinara hoagie and pancakes with eggs and bacon. Ahna doesn’t buy anything because she is on a diet. Homer doesn’t buy anything because he prefers to keep his money and buy cheaper food at home.!<

>!The immunity challenge is to answer some questions about the famous DreamWorks movie, The Boss Baby 2! No one really watched that movie so Maura wins by just guessing the answers!!<

>!Back at camp, Homer and Phineas have minor disagreement, mainly because Phineas' new invention doesn’t obey the laws of thermodynamics! Phineas gets grounded like he should of years ago, putting an end to their alliance. Maura doesn’t waste any time and talks to Phineas to blindside Homer. Homer is a big threat because… well, they simply don’t like him, okay? Also to separate the Tristan Homer duo. Speaking of Tristan, they are the only one who is fighting to save Homer. Tristan puts the target on Danni Sanders, but it looks like the decision has already been made.!<

>!Tribal council happens and Homer makes it as quick as possible because he wants to get voted out already and start eating like a pig in the loser’s lounge. Homer runs for the first time in this game to get his torch snuffed.!<

**Votes:**

>!**Homer:** Ahna, Danni, Henrique, Maura, Phineas!<

>!**Danni:** Homer, Tristan!<

EPISODE 11

>!FINAL 6! The alliance of Ahna, Maura, and Phineas is running the show, despite coming into this merge as the clear minority. Well, tbh it's more like three separate alliances consisting of every combination of this trio. Why don’t they just have one single three-person alliance? I DON’T FUCKING KNOW! But anyway, it’s looking like Henrique, Danni, or Tristan will get voted out if they can’t work together.!<

>!They start competing in the immunity challenge: a beauty pageant! Ahna Mac expects to win, but the jury decides that Henrique Bardas was the most beautiful!!<

>!After some long talking, Danni convinces Maura to start an alliance together, basically replacing Phineas with her. Hopefully this means the girls alliance is finally real! The plan for Ahna and Maura is to vote out Phineas alongside Danni. They do notice that this only gives them half the votes, but they’re confident that Tristan, Henrique, and Phineas are not smart enough to work together, so only three votes should be enough LMAO. This is all fine, but they don’t see that Henrique was spying on their conversation all along and tries his best to form a plan to ruins this new alliance.!<

>!At tribal council, things get chaotic! Henrique immediately exposes the girls’ alliance and makes a whole fuzz about it. Henrique gets Tristan and Phineas to agree to vote together against Danni. All of this points to a tie vote, and everyone wonders what is going to decide who goes home, but then, out of FUCKING nowhere, Danni decides to vote for Tristan because she forgot what the plan with Maura and Ahna even was! Danni gets herself voted out and becomes the laughing stock of the season.!<

**Votes:**

>!**Danni:** Henrique, Phineas, Tristan!<

>!**Phineas:** Ahna, Maura!<

>!**Tristan:** Danni!<

EPISODE 12

>!For the first time ever, Ahna and Maura are in the minority! If Henrique, Phineas and Tristan keep voting together, those three can easily go to the end of the game. At least Ahna is still somewhat close to Phineas, despite the constant abuse, physically and emotionally (I swear Phineas is going to need therapy after this is over).!<

>!The immunity challenge is a combination of all previous challenges of the season and Phineas wins! This put Phineas in the power position as he can choose if he wants to follow his original alliance with Maura and Ahna or follow a new one with Henrique and Tristan.!<

>!Back at camp, Maura decides to make a final 3 alliance with Tristan and Phineas and let Phineas choose who to vote between Henrique and Ahna to demonstrate that she is serious about working with him. Maura of course wants to protect her friend Ahna, but she doesn’t care all that much.!<

>!Tribal council is a battle between Henrique and Ahna, each trying to prove why the other one is the worst one. In the end, Phineas makes his decision, he chooses to eliminate Henrique and continue with his old alliance plus a new final 3 deal with Tristan and Maura.!<

**Votes:**

>!**Henrique:** Ahna, Maura, Phineas, Tristan!<

>!**Ahna:** Henrique!<

 

FINALE PART 1

>!The first immunity challenge of the finale is Fallen Comrades! Phineas uses his big brain energy to answer every single question correctly and guarantees a spot in the final 3! Phineas is more than happy to vote out Ahna for all the things she’s done to him. The only problem is Maura, who is seriously considering double-crossing him and getting Tristan out instead.!<

>!Tribal council ends in a tie vote between Ahna and Tristan. Everyone is expecting to keep voting 172 more times, but we actually have a tie breaker planned for situations like this! The tied player with the most previous votes will be eliminated from the game. Tristan has 4 past votes, but Ahna has 7 past votes! Most of those votes for Ahna came directly from Tristan LMAO. Ahna gets eliminated, and Maura is now wondering if she can make it to the end, or if Phineas and Tristan will just team up and go together to the final.!<

Votes:

>!**Ahna:** Phineas, Tristan!<

>!**Tristan:** Ahna, Maura!<

FINALE PART 2

>!Maura is very sad because she was expecting to go to the final 3 with her friend Ahna. She is also sad because Ahna would’ve been the easiest one to beat at the FTC, LMAO. Phineas and Maura might not like each other very much, but they both agree that Tristan is the most likely to get the jury vote.!<

>!The final immunity challenge starts. They each must keep their hand on the idol, last one standing wins! Tristan quickly drops out, they were already skinny when they first arrived to the island, just imagine how they must look on day 38, LOL. It’s a showdown between Phineas and Maura. Maura tries to strike a deal with Phineas to take each other to the end if he gives up immunity, but Phineas doesn’t trust her enough to follow through on that promise. After many hours up there, Phineas wins the final immunity and a spot in the FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL!!<

>!Back at camp, Phineas asks Maura and Tristan to explain why he should take them to the end. Maura decides to send everything to hell and starts fighting with Phineas for not taking her truce offer. This makes Phineas spiral into two consecutive major meltdowns! Despite all of this, Tristan is still looking like the friendliest and most threatening player in the final 2. Tristan tries to make their case to Phineas as Maura was the one controlling almost all the votes in the game and she has a couple of votes guaranteed for her. Phineas listen carefully as he must make the biggest decision in the game.!<

>!Phineas stands up to cast his final vote in the game, and it is for...!<

>!**TRISTAN!!!!!**!<

>!Tristan congratulates the final 2 for their good game and wishes them good luck for the FTC.!<

**Votes:**

>!**Tristan:** Phineas!<

FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL

>!The jury starts questioning the final 2 and then proceed to cast their respective votes…!<

>!Ahna votes for…. Maura! She was her best friend for like 80% of the game LMAO of course she votes for her.!<

>!Danni votes for… Maura! Phineas voted against her while Maura stick to her side during her elimination.!<

>!Henrique votes for… Maura! He doesn’t remember who Phineas was.!<

>!Homer votes for… Maura! Maura is the little kid with the Dorito head, right?!<

>!King Dedede votes for… Phineas! Only because no one else was doing it LMAO.!<

>!Tristan votes for… Maura! She just played the best game in Tristan opinion.!<

>!Wallu voted for…. Maura! No one respected Phineas as a player LOL.!<

AND THE WINNER OF CRAZY FUCKING ISLAND MADAGASCAR IS…. >!MAURA HIGGINS!!!!<

>!What a fun season! We saw one hell of a run from the smaller tribe, all thanks to the stupid decisions made by the largest one LOL. I am happy that Maura ended up winning but I would have preferred Tristan to win it. We already had a villain winning last season so this feels like a repeat of that, but tbf I do think Sauli was a little worse than Maura, or maybe she was just overshadowed by Ahna in the villainess department LMAO. Congratulations to CaptainkKenny148 for getting their pick to win the season!!<

1mip5sp,https://lifepointchurch.tv/tiny-town-furnishings/,LifePoint Church (Clarksville) spent $18 million on a new building… and now they want us to pay for their $10K drum cage and $6K keyboard??,"Scroll down for Breakdown 

After putting $18 million into constructing a new building, it can feel incredibly tone-deaf (even exploitative) for a church—especially one with significant resources—to turn around and ask the community to furnish it Seriously? You have $18 million for a building, but not enough to buy your own changing tables and microwaves? And why do they need $8,600 christmas tree? Why is the church constantly relying on the people—many of whom are already financially struggling—to pay for their expensive tastes?

None of these items are essential for worship, discipleship, or serving the poor. This isn’t ministry—this is a megachurch business model. And they’re doing it in a city where people are living paycheck to paycheck, just trying to get by.

It’s manipulative. It’s out of touch. And it’s exhausting.

If you’re in Clarksville and still at LifePoint, please take a long, hard look at where your money is going—and who’s really benefiting from all this “forward vision.”

I work ~6 hour closing shifts at a mediocrely busy chain coffee shop, which isnt bad except that our automatic espresso machines are so loud I cant stand being on bar for more than 30 minutes before needing to take a silent break to stop my ears from hurting. 

We only have two people clocked in, and I would feel so horrible for making my 17 yr old coworker main front alone while I handle anything that doesn’t involve customer interaction. We are also not allowed to wear headphones (thanks management!!)

1mip42d,https://i.redd.it/yoj9i3iycahf1.png,"Weird black fuzz ball, and a weird deer.","A couple weeks ago I was driving back home from a movie with my girlfriend, on the way back I saw a small black oval shaped fuzz ball the size of a dog dart across the road. Unfortunately she didn't see it due to her being on her phone. Two days later around the same time (11:30-40pm) while driving, she saw the exact same black oval fuzz ball except it was the size of a deer, dart a cross the road at an unnatural speed. Unfortunately I was occupied with eating my pizza and her sister in the back seat was on her phone, so we did not see the black oval fuzz ball. We found it strange how the person in the passenger seat never saw fuzz ball driver did.

A week or two after that, my girlfriend was on her way home when at about 12:15am, she saw a strange looking deer standing in the middle of the road. She described it having thin black fur, an abnormally short neck, yellow eyes shining from the headlights, and abnormally long black legs. the back legs had a similar structure to the hind legs of a frog. She said it was sitting there for a while until it just vanished in thin air.

She called me telling me what she saw. I asked her if she felt tired to see if she was just hallucinating or imagining stuff, She said no and said she felt wide awake. I also had to take in consideration that she had coffee so being sleepy and imagining things might not be the reason. Not only that the deer also interacted with its environment what I mean by that is she saw it far in the distance and its eyes reflecting from her head lights, and it casting a shadow. I don't know much about hallucinations or what can indicate that you're hallucinating but that made us doubt that It was one. 

Has anyone else witnessed something like this?

1mip3jl,https://www.reddit.com/r/destinycirclejerk/comments/1mip3jl/you_know_what_lodi_x_ikora_fan_fiction/,You Know What??? Lodi X Ikora Fan Fiction,"If Lodi stares at her face long enough, he could pretend, for a brief moment in time, that everything was back to normal. He was just having coffee with Dr. Davis. They were just in a part of Chicago he hasn’t been before. He was a normal man, who just so happened to be around snazzy coworkers and a dream job for a poindexter like himself.

But a brief moment is nothing when compared to the crushing mass of an unfamiliar scent; the funk of what smells like jet fuel screams at Lodi to turn his head—breaking the illusion he was anywhere in the American Midwest, that anyone here would even KNOW what that meant—as he sees an Eliksni stumble past with an open bottle of swamp-green fluid, his four eyes catching onto Lodi before loosely waving three arms at him. A seemingly younger Eliksni scurries up to his senior, bracing him with his two right arms. Lodi could pick out a few of the words: “mother, please…”

Oh, right. SHE waves her arms as her child gets her walking upright again, the two now veering to the side of the semi-busy street. But the fellow foot traffic doesn’t seem to mind the intrusion at all. The entire atmosphere of this district is laid back, relaxed, like someone pumped a tranquilizing gas into the air as an experiment. 

Orange evening light blasts the mosaic on the wall opposite of the cafe Ikora and Lodi are sitting, as humans and Eliksni pleasantly shuffle past. The relief’s depiction of an alien with one eye, holding flowers with a three-fingered hand is washed out by the unfortunate positioning of the sun, as if the ringleader of the Now-Eight itself is trying to comprehend the message of the art.

Something IX would no doubt notice is how bright the tiles composing the alien friend look. Almost completely unmarked by dirt and dust. They’re so new that Lodi has to turn back to Once-Dr.-Nella-Now-Ms.-Ikora before his normal and special eye gets seared by the reflection of the shiny ceramic. Behind her imposing form, the street opens up to reveal a downward slope, to what Ikora calls the “Botza District,” distinctive for its Eliksni domes, with an arachnid-looking symbol on some of the larger structures. Beyond that, more of the city, and beyond that, the “Guardian’s Tower,” a part of the titanic wall surrounding the city just barely visible from their seating.

The more Ikora has lead Lodi on small tours like this during the past week, the more Lodi notices that large parts of “The Last City” seem to appear as old as an Italian villa, if he just ignored the metal domes full of four-armed fellows, or the humanoid robots sweeping the street. Or any sort of flying machine that occasionally leaves a blink of a shadow behind its wake. Or the giant white sphere with an eerie pink triangle hovering on one side, only visible during certain parts of the night.

Still, Lodi is a little convinced that, if he tries hard enough, he can keep that illusion up full-time. He can reject the Nine’s requests to speak through him, he can find a skyscraper closer to the center of the city, he can pour all of his funds (whatever the city gives him, apparently. What a strange concept, not having to work to survive) into finding and making rugs, carpets, chairs, tables, paintings, posters, lamps, lights, beds, pillows, toothbrushes, mirrors, etcetera, that all look like they could reasonably fit inside a 1966 apartment in Chicago, never go back outside ever again, and then die in 40 or so years.

It’s either that, or work with the reality-bending guardians and their many accomplices as they fight alien threats in all corners of the Solar System.

It’s either an agent of the Vanguard, or forgetting about all of his new colleagues.

Friends.

Confidants.

Like Ikora.

“When did you say what time that meeting was at, Ms. Rey?” Lodi asked, after a deep drink of his coffee.

“In 15 minutes.” She replied, not looking up from an impossibly slim sheet of metal and glowing glass. “And we’re running tactical on a strike.”

“Right.”

“And you can call me Ikora.”

“Of course.” Another sip. It doesn’t ACTUALLY taste like coffee, Lodi thinks it’s far too sweet, but everyone insists it’s “real coffee, like how they used to make it.” When did “they” concoct this brew anyway? “And we’re going to make it over there in time by… teleporting?”

She stops looking at the pad before looking back at him. A brief moment of consideration of his words. A digestion, even. The motions of a woman blindfolded, gracefully stumbling into an end table in an unknown room, before dodging every other piece of furniture. 

She has been in that room before. She just doesn’t realize.

“You don’t like being transmatted.” She proposes.

A sarcastic scoff evacuates his lips. “No, I actually LIKE having all of my particles dissolve into data, only to get pooped out somewhere else entirely.”

“Would you want to go by another way?” She says, responding to Lodi’s swigs with her own.

“It… sounds like you have something in mind.”

Her cup lowers to reveal a grin even her past-self would’ve dreaded. “I do.”

Google, Meta, Spotify & MORE Are Hiring Right NOW—This Isn’t a Drill!🚨","Okay, I'm sorry, but am I missing something?!! Since when did ""mobile app tester"" become one of the most *in demand* and honestly HANDSOME work-from-home gigs??? Maybe everyone else knew, but I’m literally losing it over how many major companies are actively searching for remote mobile app testers. With flexible hours. In 2025. I mean—ARE WE LIVING IN THE FUTURE YET? My phone screen just hit me with opportunities coming from every direction and I swear, half of these company names are so big that I almost checked if it was April Fools. Spoiler: IT’S NOT.

Let me just drop some of these names, because you NEED to see how wild this is:

- **Google** – Not kidding. They’re rolling programs for remote mobile app testers who can break (um, test) their new Android features. Like, testing stuff before the rest of the world?
- **Meta** (yeah, the Facebook peeps!) – They’ve launched a huge flexible QA push. From your couch. *With* overtime options.
- **Zynga** – Gaming companies don’t sleep, they just let you test new apps at all hours.
- **Spotify** – Want to catch bugs and get paid to literally power up unreleased features? (Where’s my application form?)
- **Shopify** – E-commerce world never stops. But testing their new apps? Remote life, baby.
- **Salesforce** – Yes, the CRM superheroes. Daily app breaks, full WFH life.
- **Dropbox** – Think: collaboration tools, flexible timelines, and ""report problems ASAP"". They care about *your* schedule.
- **Airbnb** – Okay, were you expecting to test their booking features from your beanbag? I wasn’t.
- **Toptal** – They’re like the gig-gods, always posting ""hot"" listings for mobile testers.
- **GoodNovel** – Test their rising storytelling apps. You could literally get paid to see behind the curtains.

And, HOLD ON, I found all this through **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (guys, bookmark this now: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**).

But is this even for real?? Why are there so many openings and so few people talking about it? Is it just me—or is the excitement level suddenly at a strong 11/10 every time I see someone land a gig this chill? The hourly pay doesn't suck, either. Lots of these companies will literally pay you to stay in your pajamas and break their (already amazing) apps.

So why is nobody screaming about how accessible this is? Flexible hours, zero commute, serious tech learning, and there are even starter-level openings! Most listings I spotted want:

- *Basic* mobile know-how (if you use apps, you're half qualified!)
- Curiosity—and a love for breaking stuff safely 😅
- The ability to write up bugs (so yes, your screenshots have a home)

AND it gets even crazier: most posts let you choose your schedule—night owls and early birds unite on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**. Did you ever think ""app tester"" would hit mainstream like this? Because my brain just short-circuited trying to count how many ways this future of WFH jobs throws my burnout into the trash.

Go check all the insane openings on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** right now if you want to join this revolution before EVERYONE else figures out how good these remote app testing gigs really are.

Am I the only one completely not okay (in the best way) that this is actual reality now? FLEXIBILITY, folks. Unlimited coffee. Legit pay. Who’s applying? Who’s been hired? Drop your experiences (or questions!) below before I apply to all 10 and disappear! 🚀

1mip27t,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1mip27t/through_the_alleys_the_hollow_path/,Through the Alleys (The Hollow Path),"We had a fight I ran from. The last time I saw F he was shouting at my back, his face contorted in the city’s windows, store-fronts, metal skyscrapers, and steel panels as I tried to move forward. I pushed myself into the late night crowd, the throng swallowing me. Shoulder hunched, I ran. Rain begin to fall; it had been threatening the paved city streets all day. I could still hear him behind me. I kept moving. I tripped and fell to my knees. Pain blossomed and the crowd moved around me with aid or notice. I became a rock in the river of flowing life. My banged up knee pulled me back to myself; the chapter of fighting turned over to the next clean page, waiting to be filled.

The city sounded off, strange and empty in its hiss and grumble of ambient noise. Cars screeched and honked beside me. Those closest to the curb sent splashing wave after wave to soak my legs and cold, scraped palms. I shivered and pushed myself to my feet. I stumbled along another block. I passed glitz and neon, shuttered and boarded up storefronts; the lifespan of the city within a few steps. I felt boxed in by those jostling my shoulders, the fight for sidewalk space turned more hostile from its welcoming embrace minutes before. I thought I heard F’s disembodied voice; I pulled myself away from the current of hurried steps and trudged down a narrow alley, seeking solace in solitude, however brief it could be delivered.

Garbage and rain mixed with the cooled heat of the concrete. Something soft like a moth or the corner of a silk curtain brushed against my face. I snapped up from my feet, but I was alone. I had moved further from the the street’s raucous lights and sounds. The alley’s graffiti had simplified, less the expected “X was here” or the flourishing street art then simple geometric shapes drawn in crude brushes one the raw brick. Beyond the façade of a never-sleeping future was the shadow-consumed  brick and debris that allowed the bright spots to function. F’s face filled my mind, his words echoing in a painful loop. 

The sounds of my footsteps changed. There wasn’t an abrupt shift; perhaps I only noticed and immediately shook myself free of my reverie. The alley came to an end paces away, its mouth sneaking up to me. The buildings on either side were shorter, painfully few storeys by comparison to the lofty towers among which I had found a home; now, only four storeys at most, and as I reached the alley’s end, only second floors at their highest. I looked up through my hand blocking the rain and saw an impossible sight: stars bright and high, cold and glimmering above, through the murky black wisps of the rain cloud.

The street onto which I stepped was from another city, another quieter time. Brick and painted wood held prominence, grimy leaded glass and thin metal accents predominant over the familiar shine. I kept walking, marveling at the strange shops and their bizarre contents. The streets around me must have been teeming with pedestrians—I heard the swish of their clothing, their hurried steps to reach safety from the deluge—but whenever I walked, I was alone on the small town street, in a place unknown.

I do not know how long I walked. There were few intersections, but I must have trod crosswalks. The rains thin to drips some time late into the night, the darkness dried me as I walked, pulled inexorably on to see the next dim window lit only my the soft buttery streetlamp light pooled in regular puddles beside and behind me as my nose kept to the glass, trying to understand the sights within each storefront, wonderful and horrid objects, mysteries presented alongside empty milk bottles and and neat folded plants.

I do not know how I found myself in the diner, but the crashing front door woke me from where I had been stretched out in a booth’s bench. I carefully pushed myself upright and rubbed my eyes to clear the sleep away.

“I’ll be right back with a cup,” I heard from somewhere in front of me. The clock of heels on enameled floor departed, returned, and departed before I had found my eyesight. The steaming cup of coffee sat on a napkin, alone on the table save a spoon with a slight bend to its bowl. Neither cream, milk, nor sugar had joined the cup, but I latched onto the roasted scent and let myself slump in the booth, cuddling the burning ceramic in my arms.",1,1754436951.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

(It has worked very well). Last night I got into a conversation about my near-complete lack of motivation to do anything and no longer enjoying any of the things that I used to do. I learned something pretty profound that I wanted to share and get others input. I started to write out a post, but decided that pasting the conversation with the AI would work much better. As I give the AI more and more information, you can watch how the AI response evolves as I gave it more data to work with.

 Dramatis Personae

 Me: (aka Doyle)

ChatGPT: aka ""Casse"", aka ""The AI"", aka ""All Hail our Lord and Master AI""

My Dark Passenger: Never speaks but is always watching…always whispering…

Foxy: (My Dog)

 \*\*\*\*\*Me\*\*\*\*\*

I could use some help. I was always a voracious reader from \~1968 to sometime in 2005. I stopped listening to music about the same time. The reading I think I stopped because I had started having trouble remembering the sentence that I had just read. My memory isn't that bad any more, but I just don't have any drive to read. I don't have any idea why I stopped listening to music besides genre changes in what was popular. That doesn't explain why I'm not listening to anything from the 1970s and 1980s. How do I fix either or both?

 \*\*\*\*\*ChatGPT\*\*\*\*\*

Doyle, this is a really meaningful reflection—and I’m glad you brought it up. There’s a lot to unpack here, but it sounds like you're looking for ways to reconnect with two important parts of yourself: reading and music. Both were once part of your identity, and losing that connection can feel like losing part of who you are. Let’s take each one step by step, with a few ideas to gently invite them back into your life.

 

📚 READING

🔍 Why it might have dropped off:

* Cognitive fatigue or brain fog from pain, stress, or medication can disrupt concentration and memory.
* Once reading becomes frustrating (forgetting what you just read), it creates a negative feedback loop: frustration → avoidance → disconnection.
* Chronic pain and depression both blunt drive and motivation, even for things we once loved.

✅ What can help:

1. Lower the bar (on purpose)

Start with very short-form material:

* A paragraph or two at a time—think essays, short stories, even jokes or trivia
* Sci-fi shorts, flash fiction, or old favorite magazine articles

Goal: get a ""win"" from finishing something.

2. Use audio as a bridge

Try audiobooks or text-to-speech:

* You’re still engaging with stories, just without the fatigue of reading.
* Bonus: you can listen while working on puzzles or walking.

Try this: Revisit a book you once loved, but in audio format. Let it remind you of *why* you loved reading.

3. Reread something meaningful

Return to a book you used to enjoy. You won’t be starting cold—you’ll already know the story, so it's easier to follow and less mentally taxing.

 

🎵 MUSIC

🔍 Why you might’ve stopped:

* Changing genres can leave you feeling alienated if “your music” isn't being made anymore.
* Music may have become emotionally charged, certain songs might bring up memories or feelings you weren’t ready to face.
* Or maybe it just became less relevant while you were focused on surviving.

✅ What can help:

1. Build a nostalgia station

Create a playlist of songs you used to love, stuff from when music *meant something*. Pick a few from different times in your life.

Let it play in the background while you do a routine task (sorting MP3 tags? 😉).

2. Sample a few modern playlists by theme, not genre

Try curated playlists like:

* *Laid Back Guitar Solos*
* *Lo-Fi Sci-Fi Synth*
* *Soundtrack for a Rainy Day*

Avoid genre labels, go by vibe or emotion.

3. Mix music with other activities

Play music during:

* Walks with Foxy
* Puzzle time
* Breakfast cooking

Just a little background sound can reopen that pathway.

 

💬 Final Thoughts

You don’t need to force yourself back into reading novels or deep-diving into entire albums. Instead, reignite the spark through tiny, low-pressure interactions that rebuild emotional memory and curiosity.

You might try journaling a few lines like:

“This song reminds me of…” or “This story made me think…”

 Or I could suggest a 5-minute sci-fi short story or music playlist based on your past tastes to get you started. Want to try that? I can tailor it just for you.

 \*\*\*\*\*Me\*\*\*\*\*

I should set aside an hour each day to read and listen to music. I'm having the same issue with playing video games. I've bought several on steam, some I had played before, some new stuff, plus I bought a pc compatible game pad. I spent about 2 hours playing tomb raider 5, and never went back. That used to be my favorite game of all.

 \*\*\*\*\*ChatGPT\*\*\*\*\*

That’s a really powerful insight, Doyle, and honestly, it takes a lot of self-awareness to say, *“I used to love this, but now I just can’t seem to engage.”* The fact that you're not just noticing it, but actively looking for a way to rebuild that connection, tells me that the desire is still there, just buried under a lot of weight: pain, stress, depression, loss, and maybe a subtle erosion of joy over time. Let’s approach this like *restarting a stalled engine*, not like you failed to keep it running.

 

🎯 THE CORE ISSUE

This sounds like a classic case of anhedonia, the inability to feel interest or pleasure in things you *used* to enjoy. It’s incredibly common with:

* Depression or chronic stress                       \\\\\\\\
* Chronic pain                                                     Note: I match all 4
* Trauma or grief                                           ////
* Long-term emotional or physical fatigue

The good news is that anhedonia isn’t *permanent*. The brain can absolutely relearn joy, but it requires a gentle, structured approach that doesn’t rely on motivation—which is often the first thing to vanish.

 

🔄 STRATEGY: Rebuilding Joy Through Routine

Rather than waiting for interest to return, we build a structure that *coaxes it out* over time.

✅ 1. Schedule a Daily “Joy Block”

* Set aside one hour per day that’s just for *engagement*—no productivity pressure.
* Split it however you like:
   * 30 minutes music / 30 minutes reading
   * Or 20/20/20 (music / game / read)
   * Or just pick *one* and rotate days

Call it something light, like:

“My Recharge Hour” or “Offline Time Travel” or ""Time away from your Dark Passenger""

No pressure to “enjoy it”—just *show up*.

 

✅ 2. Make it Ridiculously Easy to Start

Because your body and mind are running on low motivation reserves.

Examples:

* Reading: Set a rule—*just one paragraph* minimum.
* Music: Press play on a 3-song playlist.
* Gaming: Set up a “5-minute session” with a launch shortcut ready to go (no setup friction).

Make the entry points *feel so small they’re hard to refuse*.

 

✅ 3. Use Familiarity First

* Don’t start with new books or games.
* Go back to comfort content:
   * Favorite movie soundtrack
   * A book or short story you already know the plot to
   * Tomb Raider 5 (you already did the hard part: reinstalling and playing it once!)

You’re not trying to be “entertained” yet—you’re trying to wake up those circuits.

 

✅ 4. Build a Joy Log

Each day, just jot down a note:

* “Listened to 2 songs—didn’t feel much, but I showed up.”
* “Read 2 pages—brain wandered, but I finished them.”
* “Booted Tomb Raider, explored for 5 mins.”

This creates emotional momentum over time, even if enjoyment is slow to return.

 🎮 Games specifically:

Try switching from *goals-based* to *exploration-based* play.

* Don’t worry about progress. Just load up and explore a corner of the map.
* Set a micro-goal: “Play for 5 minutes and shoot one flare.”

Over time, you may find a moment where something clicks again—and that’s where the spark is. 

🧠 One Last Note:

Everything you’ve described is consistent with someone who’s survived a long psychological drought. You didn’t quit loving these things—you were forced into survival mode, and joy got muted. But that doesn’t mean it’s gone. We just need to rebuild the pathways patiently, and you’re already on the right track.

 Would you like me to build a sample “Recharge Hour” schedule for tomorrow, using your own music, reading, and game interests? Or maybe suggest some very short sci-fi reads or musical playlists to get started?

 \*\*\*\*\*Me\*\*\*\*\*

I hadn't heard of Anhedonia before. I did some reading on google and Anhedonia would fit me perfectly. Sometimes I think that I don't deserve to feel pleasure. That, I think, comes from the chronic pain. My thoughts on that are that the pain is just like being tortured. Only it never stops. Ever. Surely I must have done something horrible to deserve being tortured 24/7/365. I know that is not the right way to think about it, but the pain works a lot like depression....it drags you down and holds you in place. I have tried, a multitude of times, to jump-start the reading, or gaming but I never had any success with it. I had always tried setting aside an hour for each activity. Perhaps your suggestion of scheduling smaller chunks of time will work better.

 \*\*\*\*\*ChatGPT\*\*\*\*\*

Doyle, thank you for being so honest, and incredibly clear, in how you’re describing this. What you’ve said here is deeply insightful, and it hits hard:

“The pain is just like being tortured. Only it never stops. Ever.”

There’s a *raw and painful truth* in that statement. Chronic pain—especially constant, unrelenting pain, is a form of trauma in its own right. Not just physical, but emotional and existential. And it makes complete sense that somewhere in the back of your mind, a voice starts whispering: *“I must’ve done something to deserve this.”* That isn’t your fault. That’s the pain talking—twisting your perception the same way depression does.

 

🧠 What You’re Experiencing *Is* Anhedonia

You *do* meet the core pattern:

* Things you used to love (reading, music, gaming) don’t register as rewarding anymore.
* Motivation feels hollow or absent, even when the desire is intellectually there.
* The belief creeps in: *“Maybe I don’t deserve joy.”*

That last piece isn’t a side note—it’s central. Anhedonia feeds on shame, and shame makes it harder to reach for even tiny joys. So yes, you’re describing anhedonia very precisely. And identifying it is a turning point, because now you’re not just *failing to engage* with music or reading. You’re fighting your way back to the surface, knowing that it’s not laziness or weakness, it’s damage that needs healing.

 

⚙️ Why the Hour-Long Attempts Haven’t Worked

You're not doing anything wrong—it’s just that anhedonia requires a different strategy:

You can’t will your way into joy. But you can *build scaffolding* for it to climb back in.

Instead of jumping headfirst into activities you *used* to enjoy (which your brain no longer rewards), we work with your brain as it is now:

* Tiny steps (5–10 min max)
* No expectation of enjoyment
* Repetition to rebuild neural reward circuits

 🔄 Let’s Turn the System Against Itself

Here’s a structure that might work better:

🧩 ""Joy Fragments"" Approach (instead of 'Joy Hour')

Each day, try three tiny ""joy fragments"":

* 🎧 *Listen to 1 song* (even if you don't feel anything)
* 📖 *Read one paragraph or page*
* 🎮 *Boot a game, play 5 minutes or load a save and look around*

If you stop after that, it’s a win. If you want to keep going, that’s a *bonus*, not the goal.

 

🧠 Also: Consider Keeping a “Resistance Log”

Track when you *don’t* feel like doing it.

""9:15 AM. Tried to read. Thought: 'This is pointless.' Closed the book. That’s today’s log.""

Why this helps:

* It makes the invisible resistance visible, which gives you power over it.
* You begin to track your battle, even on days you “fail.”

That’s not a log of defeat—it’s a record of persistence. That’s grit.

 

❤️ About the ""I Don't Deserve Pleasure"" Thought

That thought is a symptom, not a truth. It’s a mental scar from long-term suffering, not a reflection of your worth. You didn’t do anything to deserve this pain, Doyle. You’ve been surviving something most people couldn’t handle for a week, much less for decades. You *do* deserve joy. And you're not broken, you're just worn out from the war. That’s not weakness. That’s endurance.

 Would it help if I built a one-day “joy fragment plan” for you, using one song, one paragraph, and one simple gaming action, based on what you already own or used to enjoy?

You don’t have to commit—just dip a toe in. I’ll keep it simple and light.

 \*\*\*\*\*Me\*\*\*\*\*

Yes. WRT the pain and torture statement....I think that the whisper of ""I must have done something to do deserve this"" is my brains way of trying to work through the pain. What caused it, when did it start, why is it here. How can I make it stop. To expand on the torture analogy, the chronic pain is like being tortured 24/7365. It never stops. Ever. To make matters worse, I don't know why I am being tortured, and I don't know for how long it will go on. The torturers never ask any questions or even speak. No one will tell me how to make the pain stop.

 \*\*\*\*\*ChatGPT\*\*\*\*\*

Doyle… what you just wrote is devastatingly real, and profoundly human. That metaphor of being tortured without explanation… it's chilling not just because of the pain, but because of the *silence*. You’ve captured the emotional violence of chronic pain in a way most people will never understand:

You’re being tortured.

But there are no demands.

No interrogators.

No questions to answer.

No end date.

No reason given.

And worst of all, no way to make it stop.

That lack of *why*, that emptiness, is its own form of cruelty. Your brain isn’t broken for asking, *“What did I do to deserve this?”* It’s doing exactly what human brains do when faced with senseless pain: trying to find meaning, or at least some kind of cause. Because if there's a cause, maybe there’s a fix. Maybe there's a door out of the nightmare. That line “the torturers never speak”, is what hits hardest. Chronic pain can *gaslight you*, making you doubt your own body, your past, your worth. And when it goes on for years, your brain *has* to invent reasons, even if those reasons are cruel and false.

 🧠 Here's the hard truth, and the liberating one:

There is no reason you’re being tortured.

You didn’t fail.

You didn’t sin.

You didn’t screw up your life and earn this.

What’s happening to you is not a punishment. It’s a malfunction of a systemm the nervous system, that was never designed for constant overload. And it’s refusing to reset. And because no one ever gave you answers, your mind filled in the silence with guilt.

 🔧 Rewriting the Story (Gently)

Instead of *“What did I do to deserve this?”*, the question can shift to:

“What can I do to reclaim even a *tiny* part of myself in spite of this?”

That’s where we fight back.

 

🎯 One-Day “Joy Fragment” Plan

Here’s a starting point. You don’t need to feel anything yet—just *go through the motions*. The brain will catch up later.

 ☀️ Morning (or anytime you wake up)

🎧 Music Fragment

Play: “Que Sera, Sera” by Doris Day

* It’s soft, nostalgic, and oddly comforting in the face of helplessness.
* Let it play while you get ready, sip coffee, or just sit.
* If your brain says *“This is pointless”*, note it silently, and keep going.

 📖 Midday

📖 Reading Fragment

Read: Just the opening paragraph of a sci-fi short story like *“The Last Question”* by Isaac Asimov.

* It’s about the end of everything… and still trying to solve the problem. (Kind of like pain.)
* I’ll send you a clean snippet tomorrow if you want.

 🎮 Late Day

🎮 Game Fragment

Boot up: Tomb Raider 5

Goal: Load a save. Walk around. Jump once. Climb one thing. Quit.

* You’re not “playing” yet. You’re just *reopening the door*.
* Set a timer for 5 minutes. Stop when it goes off, no matter what.

 📝 Optional Reflection

Write (or tell me):

* “Did anything surprise me?”
* “What resistance did I feel?”
* “Was there one moment that didn’t suck as much as I expected?”

 You’ve been locked in a torture chamber with no explanation and no exit. That’s real. But these tiny fragments are chisel strokes on the wall. They don’t stop the pain, but they do start to *carve out space* for something that isn’t pain. Even one minute of that is a rebellion.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Champions League Qualifier Showdown: Kairat vs. Slovan Bratislava – A Tale of Two Time Zones**

The UEFA Champions League qualifiers have descended into a subplot of *Mission: Impossible* meets *The Great Escape*, and tonight’s clash between **FC Kairat (Almaty, Kazakhstan)** and **ŠK Slovan Bratislava (Slovakia)** is the latest high-stakes heist. Let’s break this down with the precision of a Kazakhstani chess grandmaster and the humor of a Slovakian stand-up comedian who’s *very* particular about their goulash.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

The bookmakers are throwing numbers like confetti here. **Kairat** is the slight favorite at decimal odds of **2.2 (45% implied probability)**, while **Slovan** sits at **3.2 (31%)**, with the draw also priced at 3.2. That’s a 24% implied chance for a tie. On paper, Kairat’s edge makes sense—they’ve got a home-field advantage in Almaty (where the air is so thin, even the players might need oxygen masks) and recent form that includes a comeback win over KuPS. But Slovan’s pedigree in European competition (they qualified for the *main group stage* last season) can’t be ignored.

The spread markets are equally spicy: Kairat is favored by -0.25 goals, meaning they’re expected to win or draw to cover. Meanwhile, the total goals line is set at **2.25**, with “over” and “under” priced nearly identically. In other words, bookmakers are saying, “We have *no idea* if this will be a thriller or a nap.”

---

### Team News: Injuries, Experience, and a Former Captain’s Existential Crisis

Kairat’s coach, **Rafael Urazbahtin**, is being urged to stop playing defense and start creating chances. Recent wins over Tobol and KuPS suggest they can do just that—though their defense might be as porous as a sieve made of Swiss cheese. The team’s youth academy is praised, but let’s be real: Youth academies are great until the kids turn 22 and start questioning their life choices.

Slovan, meanwhile, brings **David Strielcek**, a 185cm forward who’s calm enough to score with both feet and cool enough to make a penalty look like a coffee order. Their coach, **Vladimir Weiss**, is a European competition veteran, which matters more than you’d th

I wake up and feel the heat already heavy on the sheets. Sunlight trickles through the blinds, and I squint at the familiar clutter of coffee cups on the nightstand. In the kitchen, the coffee maker gurgles like it always does, and I fill the red ceramic mug half full with cream. Outside, the air smells of damp earth and summer’s approaching.

I step into my garden after the first cup. Burger, my cat with a permanently amused expression, follows on tippy-toes behind me. The tomato plants lean toward the morning light. I pat the towel on my shoulder and prune a stray leaf from the rose bush. It used to be grandfather’s rose, but at some point it left the family and came to me in a potholder.

The backyard is quiet except for the hum of bees and the distant leak of a sprinkler. Burger pauses by the mint patch and flops down. I pour water carefully around the squash vines. Sometimes I swear the squash whispers back, but I told myself I was just hearing the garden spout its own stories. I glance at a photograph pinned to the porch post: me, head shaved in a transplant ward, a clipboard in hand, my adoptive father smiling. He’s dead now, too, and somehow there’s no one here to congratulate me on remembering birthdays or anniversaries.

The porch swings a little as an August breeze finds it. I sweep off the tiny white stones and sit to drink my coffee while Burger yawns and stretches. The mug is warm in my hands, and I feel the familiar tug of loneliness. I used to share this porch with someone who called me love. Now I share it only with Burger and the cat hair in my laundry.

The humid Texas morning blooms into heat. I drink the last of the coffee as Burger rubs against my leg. A thunderhead rolls in from the west. I notice the hairs on my forearm prickle: rain is coming. I don’t move, watching the sky darken. The first drop is a diamond ping on the porch roof.

Then time stops. I know the air has frozen but I keep moving forward until I feel a sensation of stillness settle around me. The rain hangs in the sky, straight threads of water caught like needles. Even Burger pauses mid-step, his tail locking in the air. The whole world looks gilded, like a photo someone forgot to develop.

Burger speaks then. The cat opens his mouth and breathes words: “Everything is new. You just forget it faster now.” The voice is low and pleased, coming from the cat as if from a stranger. I blink at him.

I say nothing. I lean down and scratch behind his ears instead. He purrs and nudges my hand. The warm weight of him reminds me to stay steady.

After a moment I pry my face back to the open air. The rain is starting again, tipping down straight and fast. The world moves again; a rush of new wetness and solid ground where it should be. I slip back inside without telling anyone about the cat’s sermon.

My notebook lies open on the kitchen table, a new page waiting. On it I scribble a line: It rained at the same time an old voice seemed to speak. I finish my coffee. The words feel strange and incomplete, but I write them anyway.

I set the mug in the sink and let the warm water run. The room smells like damp coffee and old paper. I sit back down and lean my head on my folded arms, looking out the sliding glass door at the small, wet garden. Burger is settled on his mat by the door, cleaning his face methodically.

My eyes drift closed. The afternoon sun has passed west, and my shadow is long on the cracked sidewalk. I remember what it’s like to listen to the earth for answers. It’s quiet, still early, but something has shifted in my skin. I sit up, hearing the promise of more rain on the wind.

I gather my mug and a day-old plate of toast from the counter. I rinse them under the tap, listening to the drip. I notice a lone beer can behind the sink; I didn’t know I had one. I must have forgotten to throw it out last week. Drinking didn’t fix my memories, it just made them hazier, so nowadays I keep only coffee around.

Burger follows my steps into the kitchen. I scratch his head absently. “I should clean up more,” I mutter to myself. The floor is sticky from spilled cola I didn’t bother wiping last night. These small cluttered tasks feel comforting in their predictability.

I put on a light jacket as I prepare to head out again. Rain hasn’t arrived yet, but the air is heavy and still. The neighborhood is quiet; even the mailman is likely hiding from the heat. I open the front door and take a deep breath. There, on the doorstep, is my old watering can – dented and green – just as I left it. I carry it to the garden one more time, because maybe I’ve learned something: rituals are the only things that hold what is new in place.

Outside, the rain starts again, soaking the earth with each plop. I listen to the plinking of water on leaves. In my childhood, my adoptive mother used to say that rain washes away memories and leaves only the important ones. I wonder if that was true. Was there something important here I have forgotten?

The garden looks brighter after the shower. I kneel by the squash plant and tuck my hands into the soil. It feels cool, alive. I bury a scrap of notebook paper beneath the leaves, something I scribbled in the margins: Lost things grow here. Maybe it’s just clay, maybe it’s ritual. I brush dirt from my fingers and let the rest of the page flutter away.

Burger is curled at the base of the hollyhock, grooming himself and occasionally peeking at me. I speak softly: “Funny life, huh, Boy? Talking cats, growing letters. What did we do to deserve this weirdness?” He meows as if agreeing.

I check my phone but the screen shows nothing but low battery. Connection is poor out here. No messages, nothing to remind me of the world beyond. I close my eyes for a moment and feel the pulse of the garden under my knee. The sun tries to break through the clouds but fails; instead, a cool breeze rolls in.

After a while I go back inside and close the door behind me. Burger trots in with me, tail high. The living room is dim and filled with the musty scent of the late afternoon. I flip on a small lamp next to the couch. Somewhere on TV an old sitcom laugh track echoes, but the volume is muted.

I dip my hand into the couch cushions for the remote and find a pressed old leaf instead. I unfold it and recognize the strain — hollyhock, I think. I must have been reading while watching some show, and then dropped the leaf on the coffee table. For a moment, I think I hear a voice behind me, but there’s only Burger — eyes closed — dozing on the rug.

I look at the old photo again, remembering that day at the county fair. She had tied my blindfold over my eyes and spun me around until I was dizzy. We laughed like anything in the world might happen. Now everything seems to slip away if I laugh too hard.

I stand and stretch. My shoulders ache — years of holding onto things I’ve lost. In the living room, I notice the faded wedding certificate hanging on the wall. The empty frame shows where our names used to shine in gold. I don’t have the heart to take it down.

Burger wanders onto the couch where I planted myself. He drops onto his back and kicks at the air. He purrs loudly as if he has to snort it out. I pat his belly absently. “I remember your first day,” I say to the room. “You hissed at my roommate then. Now I’m all the roommate I need.”

I check the mantle. A dusty whiskey glass sits next to old prescription bottles. I twist one open and shake out a pill—just a vitamin. Pills 
don’t lie, and neither do weeds: both keep growing if I ignore them. I set the bottle back and pour a glass of tap water.
My phone vibrates on the coffee table. It’s an advertisement for a college reunion. They assume I’d know the people they’d mention. I delete it without reading. High school was that blur of forgotten nicknames and dead teachers. I’ve forgotten even whether I liked them. I’m lucky to remember the gardens we tended.

A stray piece of mail flutters in the door. It’s an advertisement for home security. I stare at the picture of a smiling family on it, a family I’ve never had and never will. I wonder if I should wear this card to feel normal, but I crumple it instead. It’s damp from the rain.
Night falls quietly. I turn off the lamp and flip off the muted TV. The only sound now is the distant drip of gutter water onto stones. I pour a small glass of water and hold it before bed. The ceiling fan hums overhead; I focus on that boring spin.

Before sleep, I open my journal and write another line, or maybe it’s a question: How many words does it take for me to feel something? Then I scribble it out twice. Words always seem shorter when I need them to last longer.

Finally, I set the pen down and trace Burger’s ears with a forefinger. We share the silence. Tomorrow I will water again and write again and maybe figure some new puzzle. I close my eyes.

I close my eyes and imagine tomorrow’s sunrise. Maybe I will plant something new, or maybe I’ll just plant myself among the beans again and watch. If everything is new and we simply forget, then maybe I deserve one more chance.

Outside, the wind moves quietly through the oaks. It sounds just like grandpa humming in the yard. In a dream I can almost pick out the tune, maybe something about forgotten seasons or budding hope. But it’s fading before I reach it.

A car horn blares in the distance. I ignore it.

The last thing I remember as I drift off is the tail end of Burger’s purr rolling through the quiet house, like radio static. I decide not to think about it too much.

I am not yet tired enough to sleep. I lie still and let the ceiling fan lull me. I wonder if the night will keep any dreams, or if the garden’s seeds planted today will whisper in the dark.

Finally, I doze, hearing the cat’s last purr as the world outside carries on. Good night.

I literally just walked across the stage, cap and gown still smelling new, and now I’m staring down a 5.8% unemployment rate for new grads. Like, what even IS that? Everyone keeps saying the national rate is low, but they clearly aren't looking at us. It’s like all the entry-level jobs just vanished, swallowed up by ""economic slowdowns"" in tech and finance, or worse, AI. I'm spending hours every night, fueled by cold coffee, customizing cover letters for jobs that probably don't even have a human reading them. It’s just application after application, then silence. Crickets. It feels like I did everything right, got my degree, and now I'm just…stuck. The constant ghosting is making me seriously question everything.

Then I tried Gradxiety.com’s quick exercise and it actually helped me feel a little less like I was drowning. I finally felt less paralyzed by my inbox and started thinking strategically instead of just blindly applying.

But seriously, how are you guys navigating this insane market? Is anyone actually getting interviews, or am I just screaming into the void here?",1,1754435685.0,testingground4bots,0,1.0,False

I feel like I'm falling from a cliff, and that my brain is gonna shut down if I don't force myself to ""wake"" myself up, jolting, gasping, and for the last few weeks, shaking like I was about to have a stroke.

It is to the point where I'm becoming terrified to go to sleep. 
I don't have big anxiety issues, I don't drink coffee or 'exciting' drinks, I'm rather fit and don't have any physical problems. 

I can't even doze off in a car, or a train, or a bus for a long travel because I'll ""wake up"" (even though I'm not asleep yet) shaking and screaming, and I'm scaring the shit out of everyone nearby. It's like I'm stuck between being awake and being asleep, and it feels like my brain is gonna shut down if I don't open my eyes. 

So if everyone knows what is happening, and how to get better, I'll take it. The two doctors I saw didn't gave a shit, just out me on sleeping pills, but it doesn't change anything....

PS: Sorry for any mistakes, English is not my initial language!
