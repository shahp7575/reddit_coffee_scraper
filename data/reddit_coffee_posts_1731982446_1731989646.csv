There‚Äôs currently a scam-dal unfolding in relation to an Aussie influencer. It‚Äôs all quite fresh so I‚Äôll share what I‚Äôve seen so far - if you search her or even Harris family on TikTok, it‚Äôs getting a bit of traction with people explaining the story. AH has made her Instagram private but her TikTok is still available. 

I‚Äôve followed her for a while and a few months ago she started sharing content about her youngest daughter being unresponsive for long periods of time. There‚Äôs one video on her TikTok which I always found really performative - she‚Äôs explaining that the baby had tumours all over her brain and doctors had no idea what‚Äôs wrong with her. In the video she repeats that she needs a new coffee machine‚Ä¶ to me it felt like a hint hint someone send me a coffee machine.

Anyway - there were fundraisers held for the family, there was a go fund me that raised over $60k. They were given a room at the Ronald McDonald house, taking it away from another family actually in need. Businesses were doing sales with proceeds to the family and sending gifts etc to them.

One of the most horrendous aspects is that baby was subjected to two brain surgeries recently and one of AH‚Äôs last posts before she went radio silent was that the baby was going to be given palliative care‚Ä¶ allegedly doctors didn‚Äôt know what was wrong with her and were out of options. 

ALLEGEDLY!!! The baby is perfectly fine. Allegedly, AH was benzoing baby girl to the nines - and hospital staff who saw her TikTok‚Äôs where the content she was sharing wasn‚Äôt aligning with what they knew reported back, toxicology reports were done and the drugs (which weren‚Äôt prescribed to baby) were discovered. 

Baby‚Äôs dad came out yesterday basically saying he had nothing to do with it, had no idea etc. It‚Äôs all very sick and very sad for the baby and their other children. I don‚Äôt understand what possesses someone to harm their own baby. 

Also I don‚Äôt know if this is ok to post but seeing as it‚Äôs very scammy thought you may find it interesting‚Ä¶",4,1731989190.0,ScamandaPodcast,0,1.0,False

I'm I delusional?","Sorry for the long story but I want to be very specific.I 32M met this english/Irish 32F at a friend's party on June 1st this year, I invited her to dance and we immediately clicked, we introduced ourselves and danced 4 salsa songs in a row. I went to sit down and I realised she was walking towards me and sat next to me and we started talking about her family my family I showed her pictures of my two month old nephew fancy showed me pictures of both of her niece and nephew then she asked me how old I was when I said 32 she said ""Yesss!"" And closing her fists like if she had won something with a big smile. Also she let me know that she was single, because her boyfriend left her for another woman they only dated for five months.

 My friend, the organizer of the party suggested we all should go to a carrier key that night when we were leaving the venue I said to her I haven't drank anything luckily I can drive and she said we can fix that üòè we drove to the place it was closed then I saw her trying to get an uber on her phone and I said to her I can drop you home and she accepted on the way to her place we kept chatting and I told her I was reading three books but I was really bad at Reading and she asked me which books were those and I said once about habits once about mindset and one is about architecture I'm an architect by the way and she is a nurse. 

After that night I saw her about three times at my friend's dancing classes and we danced and kept chatting and having nice conversations. Eventually I added her on Facebook and she accepted my request then I started chatting with her and I invited her for coffee in a walk and she accepted. It was very nice I opened the door of a coffee shop for her, pay for the coffee, we had the coffee we had a an hour walk and then we talked about backgrounds, our beliefs and the ways we see life and our values, everything aligned. She told me she converted to a Christian five years ago because she was having a really bad time partying and in drugs to escape the reality. And that God helped her go through that dark time in her life.

We said goodbye and she said see you in September which was two months away she was going to another state to work in a contract for two months. I message her the next day saying that I had a great time with her and she said she felt the same.

We started chatting every day asking how are our days went and all that. I remember the first days we started chatting every day and she said ""Forgive me if I've got this wrong but I just want to be clear that I'm not looking to date as still processing the end of my relationship. Just want to make friends""  . But I sayd I understood that. Anyway we kept chatting and every time talking about really meaningful things for both of us connecting really well making plans to do things together for when she was coming back.

I'm a very detailist man, I like to cook so I practice several ways of making the best pizza dough to cook for her and she was very excited about it. She came back to the city we live and she came to my house on the second week she was here for the pizza. I made her to make the pizza saying to her do you know how to make pizza because I just saw you and I totally forgot how to make it haha and helped her knead the dough and putting the toppings. At one point she asked me to grab the cheese for her and I asked her are you cheesy she said yes and you I asked I am too and she said and blushed. We have the pizza we had some drinks we dance and then at one point some conversation came up about the color of our eyes and she looked at mine and then I started looking at her really close and I said sorry I got lost in your eyes, she has blue eyes and I love them. We spend like five hours to gathering my house between doing the pizza drinking dancing and chatting then we went to my friend's dancing classes and we had a really really nice connection holding our hands and looking at each other you could feel that there was something in between us going on. Then I saw her again the next day and I gave her back her sunglasses she left at my place and then she started talking to me about that she didn't want me to confuse things that we were friends and because she wants to heal where she's been going through she still has some trust issues but she really values me and she says I'm a great person but this is not the right time for her. 

After two weeks we went into a trivia night and we had a really nice time together laughing, joking and once agagin that she wants to stay at least a year single and go through her healing journey that's what she called it and I ask her if she was interested in casual relationship so something not serious and she said no she said if I'm going into a relationship it's to get married and  I'm not into hookups as I want to save myself for marriage. After that we haven't talked that much as we used to, chatting paste to me has slowed down in a 80% rate I'd say. 

We haven't hangout for six weeks cheese cooking something for me an Irish stew but I don't know when. She came back from overseas on it we on a trip with her brother and she mentioned that we should go hiking when the weather is good she mentioned to me we had a list of places to go and we haven't done anything of that yet. It's going to be a four hour walk so I'm planning to say everything I feel for her and that's going to be what defines our situation maybe she needed some space and now she feels a bit more open to give herself a chance with me I don't know, who knows. 

I'm a very genuine man and I'm really into her, I really like her I have feelings for her and I don't believe in the right time the right person thing I believe that if the right person comes it'll be the right time. 

Sometime ago I decided to live in full authenticity. And a big part of that is not hiding your true self never and that you should be always be willing to get hurt no matter what the only way we grew up as a person is by suffering but we never have to be scared of suffering because our souls shrink when we do. I've been single for 10 months after a 4 year relationship that brought me to Australia where I love now and I'm really happy with who I am as a person and as a human being. I don't need anyone to fill any emptiness as I enjoy the gift of giving more than receiving and she definitely makes me want to give her all the love that I can have because I really love who she is her personality her empathy her kindness and the fact she is genuine enough to admit her mistakes in life and make amend to it and try to be a better person even though when she's been hurt. 

I wish you all the best in your journeys ‚ù§Ô∏è. Thank you for reading this.

1guoagk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1guoagk/im_worried_that_my_moms_63f_liver_is_failing/,I‚Äôm worried that my mom‚Äôs (63f) liver is failing ,"My mom, 63f, 5‚Äô6‚Äù, around 250-280 lbs, has drank every night consistently for fourteen years. She also had periods beforehand where she drank and then stopped cold turkey. In the beginning of the 14 yrs she would also get black out drunk and take prescribed medications like ambien, trazedone, etc. As far as I know she doesn‚Äôt take the sleeping pills, but she also smokes and takes several other prescription meds like meloxicam, and others I‚Äôm not sure of. 

About four-five years ago, she had to have surgery last minute to get her gallbladder taken out. I've never been sure if it was related or not.

In July, she had severe pain in her kidney area and urine the color of coffee/tea. I took her to an emergency room and they said she had a kidney infection. Then they said she didn‚Äôt, and diagnosed her with sciatic pain. That hospital did a scan to look at her organs and said everything looked healthy. I ended up having to take her to another emergency room the next day where they treated her for a kidney infection and the (horrid) symptoms went away. At the second hospital, all they did was pull her records from the previous visit and treat her for the infection. As far as I know, the symptoms went away. 

I've seen her sweat profusely in cool temps for years. I'm always freezing cold in her house/car and she still is hot. Recently, in August, we were in a nail salon and she had this random episode where she had shortness of breath, turned red all over, and got super hot/ sweaty. It scared me‚ÄîI thought she was going to have a stroke. She insisted she was fine though and eventually the episode went away. She has high blood pressure and takes two medications for it. That same day or a few days later, she called me because she forgot her bank pin. She has had the pin for longer than she‚Äôs been drinking (14 years). 

Over the past three to four years, she‚Äôs developed severe diarrhea. She will have to completely stop what she‚Äôs doing and run to the bathroom. Overall gassy, belching, etc. She also gets itchy all over. 

Recently she had bloodwork done. It's through her job, so it's not with her PCP or anything. She told me her liver enzymes were high, and that she wanted to get sober. But her plan is to cut back on alcohol now (I‚Äôve heard this before) & get sober in January, because she insists on not missing work‚Ä¶ she went to her doctor to figure out how to get sober. Her doctor told her it would take two weeks to detox. So my mom plans to take vacation time, detox, and go right back to work in January. It could definitely be a step in the right direction, however she‚Äôs been telling me the entire 14 years she‚Äôll get sober. And the plan ahead thing & not taking medical leave makes me very weary. 

I saw her most recently, two days ago, and she was glistening with sweat & hot. I may have caught a whiff of the musty liver smell? I felt she was acting strange. We have been on the rocks because of her addiction but have made up before this. She kept walking off from me, and getting lost in the store basically. My grandma did this when she started to decline mentally from Alzheimer‚Äôs. 

She also has said that she is sick and has a very, very bad cough where she is hacking stuff up. Not sure what.

Everything has been going great and I thought we were on the same page about most things with values, lifestyle, dating, etc. 

2 days ago, we were hanging out in his room and I saw a notification pop up on his phone from a girl ‚ÄúE‚Äù saying that she missed him and was excited to see him again soon. He has never hidden anything on his phone from me so I just asked who that was (because maybe it was family/a friend?). 

He is terrible at lying and always blushes a lot and came clean. It turns out that shortly after we started dating, he also met ‚ÄúE‚Äù while studying on campus in the library. He said they got on pretty well and continued to study together, which led to them dating as well. 

He knows I have been cheated on before and how hurtful that was so this made hearing this even worse :( i honestly didn‚Äôt even know what to say and left to go for a walk. After about 20 min or so I came back fully prepared to break up with him but when I got back in he asked me to sit down so we could talk. He said that he knows this hurts my feelings a lot but to hear him out. He got along so well with ‚ÄúE‚Äù that he assumed I would as well too (as if I would want to be friends with my boyfriend‚Äôs other girlfriend) but no!! He said shortly after he met ‚ÄúE‚Äù he was watching shameless and got the bright idea that we should become a throuple. He said he liked both of us a lot so why not give it a try. 

I started yelling saying absolutely not, why would you assume that‚Äôs something I would be interested in after explicitly saying how much cheating has affected me in the past. He also started yelling that I was overreacting and that he was trying to do some thing nice for the both of us in our relationship. I obviously don‚Äôt see it that way but he keeps insisting to just give it a try because it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot that weird‚Äù and making me feel bad for not hearing him out. He wants me to meet ‚ÄúE‚Äù for a coffee tomorrow but I told him there was no way that was going to happen.

1guo72q,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1guo72q/my_thoughts_on_disney_pixars_dragon_age_veilguard/,My thoughts on Disney Pixar's Dragon Age: Veilguard after 42 hours of playing and reaching level 42,"Ok, so I have not beat this game. I'm at the end of chapter 10, and I've been finishing up the companion quests before I get locked out of the main world (after chapter 11 I believe). But I've played this game a ton, and it feels like way too much.

This game started out fine. The combat seemed interesting, the graphics seemed really good, and the game was very polished. I wasn't sold on the story from the very beginning, but this might just me not being such a fantasy nut (though I've played all the God of War games and loved them, and even loved the last game in the series, Inquisition). I was disappointed that I couldn't play as my companion characters, which I knew and was already disappointed about since that missing feature was announced. So, I was locked into my warrior character and not able to try out mage or rogue (maybe I will later on). My impressions are solely based on playing the warrior class.

Anyways, you have a light attack, heavy attack, and ranged attack, all of which you can charge up. You also have special abilities -three to be exact - and your companions each have three abilities of their own which you can command them to summon. Abilities can be combo-ed, with one ability activating a certain status type (Sundered, Overwhelmed, or Weakened), and another ability can detonate an enemy with that status. Your own abilities cost some energy form; for my warrior, this was rage, which I built up by attacking and taking damage. Your abilities don't have much cooldowns at all, usually only 2 seconds (though one of mine, Titan Stomp, had a lengthy cooldown of 60 seconds). So, if you have the energy for it, you can use most of your abilities freely. Your companions on the other hand have lengthy cool downs for each of their moves, that lock them out of all of their other moves. this means you can only use one ability per companion every 20-40 seconds. The aforementioned combos are WAYYY more effective than any of the other attacks. So, once you start playing, you may want to rely on those combos more and more. By the point I am at in the game, if a character has a combo or healing move, that move is all I use. I use maybe two of the three abilities per companion, because with the companion ability cooldown, the other abilities are basically useless. They're just not as good as the combo, which deals high damage and then a large AoE attack. At the start, I thought these combos were pretty cool and made for a neat new combat system. But now I think they just make the combat so stale and such a drag. It feels terrible to me. Sure, there are some new abilities and skills that you unlock (such as being able to combo charged attacks, which was enjoyable at first while it was new), but everything becomes so monotonous. I hate it. You have options to block or parry (perfect defense), but the parry window is so annoying in that it gives a notice that an enemy is going to attack, and then a second later is the parry window. I'm used to, if there is a counter, the Arkham style games counter where you see the counter option, you press it. The delay in the parry window made it so hard for me, and I have beat the new God of War games, Star Wars Jedi games, and Lies of P all of which have parrying and I did not have so much trouble with. I'm sure this won't be a problem for everyone, but for me it was annoying as hell.

But the graphics are nice, right? Sure, the environments can look nice and the game can look pretty in motion, but the game is so stylized it looks like a Pixar movie. The griffon in the game (a species that is supposed to be a fearsome warrior) looks straight out of How to Train Your Dragon and there is a reanimated skeleton that looks like its out of Disney's Coco. But these are just side characters. The characters you play as look equally Pixary and I could mistake Emmrich the necromancer in the Necropolis to be a character in a scene out of Encanto. Qunari designs, the fierce horn-headed warrior species, look just like people. They look like people with regular faces that happen to be tall and have horns. Monsters too look cartoonish instead of fierce. I was looking at Darkspawn from Dragon Age Origins and they look so much more fearsome compared to the Darkspawn in this game. Another thing to note - in Origins when you first meet the Darkspawn, you face an army of hundreds or more of them. It is a sight to behold the fearsome army, and it makes the cutscene very intense and high stakes. In Veilguard, you just meet one Darkspawn eating some dead carcass and then you only face more than a handful a couple of times. They're not scary or intimidating, they're just some generic authorized World of Warcraft ripoff.  The entire graphics look as much like WoW's cartoony graphics as an evolution of Dragon Age graphics.

Surprisingly, I did not miss the open world very much. There are very large levels to explore with plenty of interconnecting paths and even 42 hours into the game I keep seeing new areas. But, that's only areas that I find through quests. You don't find anything interesting by wandering off the beaten path, besides maybe a big chest with some loot. There's less loot in this game than there is in other RPGs I've played, which was noticeable but in the end was not a big problem for me.

And then there's the role-playing part of it. Your character, whether you like it or not, is a typical hero. He/she/they is whippy and sarcastic, says the right things to motivate companions, and bravely accepts the responsibility of tracking down and killing the main antagonists of the game. My dialogue choices felt meaningless compared to older Bioware games that I played, as its just different versions of the same typical hero. There's a more sensitive version, a more quippy version, and a more stoic version, but besides that, there's little variation. There is no morality system to speak of here, and so far, 42 hours into the game, I have made one single choice that has had actual consequences in the game. And, you choose a faction alignment at the beginning of the game - I chose Veil Jumpers - and that has barely come into play, just mentioned in a few lines here and there. Dragon Age Origins had completely different intros based on your backstory, whether you were a human or an elf or a dwarf, or even if you were noble or poor, or from the city or rural area.

I did not like the companions in this game. Ok, I didn't find Lucanis wasn't terrible but I just did not care about any of the other ones. They felt so warm and friendly. Davrin, the fearsome warrior who is really just a sappy dog (griffon) dad, Bellara the manic pixie dream girl who's bright and believes in everyone, Emmrich the charming and kind necromancer. Lucanis, the assassin who really just loves his coffee. Harding also feels like a very safe character.

And of course, there's Taash. Now, as a person of trans experience myself, I do not care one bit that Taash is non-binary. But what I find annoying is how when they come out to their mother, and their mother says something like ""there is a word for people in our culture who are not male nor female"" Taash storms off saying ""No you don't understand, you never listen to me!"" Even though their mother clearly cares for them and wants to connect with them. And before this, Taash comes home with Rook, a new guest for dinner completely uninvited and then gets upset at their mother for not preparing a certain food. They feel more like an adolescent child or teenager than an adult, seasoned dragon hunter.

The game has an in depth character creator (which I personally don't care much about), but if you enjoy and appreciate that then it may elevate your playing experience and add to your enjoyment of the game. But, as I mentioned, if you're looking for character options besides aesthetics and tone of dialogue, you won't find it. The game is also very polished, which I do appreciate. I don't think I encountered a single bug/glitch which is really rare in games of this scale.

I wanted to love this game so badly. I loved Inquisition, and it is perhaps my favorite pure RPG that I played in recent memory. But this was a far cry from that, and even more so from the older Dragon Age games. Frankly, if you couldn't tell, I found this game to be quite awful.

Now, it must be said. This was not how I felt about the game from the beginning. For the first 20 or so hours, the game teetered between a 7 or an 8 for me. Then, it started to fall. Now, I'd give it a 4, given the amount of money and time I put into it. I hope others find this useful or can get more enjoyment from this game than I did because I am cooked and, after 42 hours, will have to drag myself to finish it. It is such a f\*ing slog, dear god.

Score so far: 3.5/10, 4 with butter

Last week, our team went on a company-sponsored trip for a client event. It wasn‚Äôt super far, just a few hours away, and the company was supposed to cover the costs. At least, that‚Äôs what I thought.

Once we got there, my boss announced that the ‚Äúbudget didn‚Äôt cover everything‚Äù and asked everyone to chip in for a few things. It started with meals. He said, ‚ÄúThe company will pay for the basics, but if you want anything extra, like appetizers or drinks, you‚Äôll need to cover that yourselves.‚Äù Fine, whatever.

I stand that I still would not choose any other department, I‚Äôm ER all the way, but now I question my career as a nurse as a whole. 

My backstory:
Within the last year I have graduated with my BSN, started in a Level 1 Trauma ER (worked as ER tech for a year during my BSN), I got married, bought a small home, got some dogs, and work my my church. Previous to that I worked at a coffee shop and I have LOVED coffee ever since. I am a ‚Äúcoffee connoisseur‚Äù some would say. Throughout school I served in my church and had been a lighting tech for a couple years, within this past year I got hired as the Director of Lighting, so I officially work for the church now, though unpaid since they aren‚Äôt in a financial position to salary me. Which totally fine, I love that job and I don‚Äôt do it for the money. Lighting is super interesting and I enjoy the job so much cause I get to run my own team and I‚Äôm my own boss. As for my love of coffee, I have always planned in a couple years I would try to open my own place. I have business plans, spreadsheets, cost breakdowns, the whole 9 yards already done on my computer for when the day comes. 

Why did I want to become a nurse?
I grew up with my little brother very sick from a rare genetic condition that causes severe drops in blood sugar. Glycogen Storage Disease, only about maybe 2,000 cases in the whole US. Funny thing is, he can‚Äôt receive most forms of sugar, his body does not process them properly as part of his condition, nor can his body release glucose to save himself from hypoglycemia. Due to this, I‚Äôve watched several emergencies to the ER. On more than one occasion I have almost watched him die. I watched my parents plead and beg, yell, at doctors and nurses who didn‚Äôt understand his condition treat him incorrectly because they didn‚Äôt understand Apple juice, glucose gel, sugar, does nothing for him. One time his blood sugar was literally 9mg/dL, but a nurse refused to give him IV dextrose because ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not acting symptomatic, look at him, he‚Äôs fine‚Äù. That will be forever engrained in my mind. 
I wanted to be someone who actually cared for people, had a heart and compassion for those hurting. 

Today:
Hospitals don‚Äôt care about compassion. Nursing as a role is great, as a job it sucks. We never have enough staff, all that matters is the bottom line and profits so they won‚Äôt hire more. I don‚Äôt even have time to be compassionate because I‚Äôm so overloaded with tasks. My preceptors tell me I‚Äôm doing great and I have a lot of potential, but I don‚Äôt know if I even have the passion and energy to want to grow my career. I thought my dream was to be a trauma nurse but now that I have the dream, it doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve won. It beats me down every shift. I had a close call where my patient deteriorated rapidly after being initially stable and I cried, I felt the guilt of what did I do wrong, why did this happen. The other RN‚Äôs told me I couldn‚Äôt have seen it coming, it wasn‚Äôt my fault and I didn‚Äôt mess up. But now I dread the day I have a patient die on me, because ER I know it will happen. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to take that mental toll, in my mind I know if it happens, I will likely just quit. 

Life has changed so fast for me, so much has happened just in the past year. And now I don‚Äôt know where to go from here. I love working for my church and I will never quit that, but it doesn‚Äôt pay. Nursing will never be what I thought it was, and it burdens me, but right now that income is what supports my bills and my wife. My dream is to become a small business owner and start a coffee shop, and tbh if I bootstrap it, I could do it within the next couple months. I found a potential space that was perfect I haven‚Äôt felt that much joy since before starting as a nurse. But do I just leave nursing and live it broke as a new business owner? Or do I work nursing to pay the bills and run the shop during my free time, but then like that I work 80hrs a week when I already feel burned out. What was the point of spending 4 years for a BSN just to give up on it. I used to have much more joy in my life, but now that I‚Äôm living ‚Äúthe dream‚Äù, I don‚Äôt know where it all went. I just want my joy back.

She is the hardest worker I know, and was never into fancy or girly things until a tiny bit in recent years, like getting Botox and using moisturizer, nothing too crazy. She was getting gel manicures for a while but says it‚Äôs too high maintenance and too much time.  She doesn‚Äôt really wear makeup and returns 99% of the clothes she buys- very particular and prefers JcPenney slacks over some of her nice Nordstroms ones.
She‚Äôs a hospital manager and flys a few times each month for meetings. Loves (keurig) coffee, baking, reading, volunteering, walking, and quality time. I feel like every gift I‚Äôve ever tried to get her was a flop- can anyone suggest anything? 
Her Kate Spade bag is her biggest luxury item and she really isn‚Äôt into luxurious things, although I did notice I turned her onto Kiehl‚Äôs skincare when I bought her a set one Christmas. 

I thought about new ugg slippers but she claims her 10 year old ones are perfectly fine.
I‚Äôve thought about getting her a certificate for a nice massage and or facial but she‚Äôs always worried about me spending money (broke college student not living at home).

When Cruns woke up again sometime later (how much later? Who knew?), he found himself lying on one of those uncomfortable medical beds in Station Gamma-12‚Äôs infirmary with several concerned-looking doctors hovering over him like curious scientists observing some rare specimen they didn‚Äôt quite understand yet but were fascinated by nonetheless.

""How are you feeling?"" one doctor asked cautiously as they adjusted some strange-looking device attached to Cruns‚Äô arm.

Cruns blinked groggily up at them before groaning softly under his breath once more‚Äîa sound that seemed to have become all too familiar lately given everything that had happened since he first made contact with Dave Thompson‚Äôs mind...

""I think..."" Cruns began slowly before pausing briefly to gather what little remained of his scattered thoughts ""...I think I need... less coffee.""

The doctors exchanged puzzled glances before nodding slowly in agreement‚Äîas if they weren‚Äôt entirely sure what had happened either but were willing enough to go along with whatever explanation made sense at this point...

And so there Cruns lay‚Äîexhausted beyond belief but somehow still alive despite everything that had transpired‚Äîas thoughts continued swirling around inside his head like leaves caught up in a whirlwind...

But somewhere deep down beneath all that chaos... one thought remained crystal clear:

""Never again.""

Cruns lay on the infirmary cot, staring at the ceiling, his mind a tangled mess of exhaustion, caffeine overload, and residual human impulses. He could still feel Dave‚Äôs thoughts lurking in the background, like an unwanted houseguest who refused to leave. Every time he tried to rest, something new would bubble up from the depths of Dave‚Äôs subconscious‚Äîsome random idea or urge that made absolutely no sense to Cruns but seemed vitally important to the human brain.

He closed his eyes, hoping for a moment of peace.

""Fix things.""

Cruns‚Äô eyes snapped open again. No. No, not this. Not now.

But the thought persisted, growing stronger by the second. It wasn‚Äôt just a suggestion anymore‚Äîit was a compulsion. An overwhelming need to ""fix"" something. Anything.

He sat up abruptly, his body protesting with a wave of dizziness and nausea. The medical staff noticed immediately and rushed over, their expressions a mix of concern and confusion.

""Sir, you really should lie back down,"" one of the doctors said gently, placing a hand on Cruns‚Äô shoulder as if that would somehow calm him.

Cruns shook his head, his four eyes blinking rapidly as he tried to focus on the room around him. ""I... I can‚Äôt,"" he muttered through gritted teeth. ""I need to... fix something.""

The doctor blinked at him in confusion. ""Fix what?""

""Anything!"" Cruns blurted out, his voice rising in pitch as the urge became unbearable. ""There‚Äôs something broken! I can feel it!""

The medical team exchanged worried glances. One of them‚Äîan older alien with too many tentacles and not enough patience‚Äîsighed heavily and rubbed their forehead with one of their appendages. ""This is clearly some kind of post-caffeine delirium,"" they muttered under their breath before turning to Cruns again. ""You don‚Äôt need to fix anything right now. You need rest.""

But Cruns wasn‚Äôt listening anymore.

The urge had taken over completely now, driving him forward with an intensity that left no room for rational thought. He swung his legs off the cot and stood up‚Äîtoo quickly‚Äînearly toppling over as his legs wobbled beneath him like jelly.

""Whoa! Easy there!"" one of the nurses exclaimed as they reached out to steady him.

""I‚Äôm fine!"" Cruns snapped, though he clearly wasn‚Äôt fine at all. His body was still trembling from the aftereffects of too much coffee (or maybe from being stuck in Dave‚Äôs mind for too long), but none of that mattered anymore because ""something needed fixing"" and he was going to find it.

Without another word, Cruns pushed past the medical staff and staggered out of the infirmary like a man possessed‚Äîbecause in a way, he was.

\---

The corridors of Station Gamma-12 blurred around him as Cruns moved with single-minded determination toward... well... ""something"". He didn‚Äôt know what yet‚Äîbut he‚Äôd know it when he saw it.

His feet carried him down hallways and through doors without any real sense of direction or purpose beyond that burning need to ""fix"". He passed by crew members who gave him strange looks but didn‚Äôt stop him‚Äîprobably because they‚Äôd already heard about his earlier escapades in the maintenance bay and didn‚Äôt want any part of whatever madness was happening now.

Finally, after what felt like hours but was probably only minutes (time had become irrelevant at this point), Cruns found himself standing in front of another piece of equipment‚Äîa large control panel mounted on one wall near one of the station‚Äôs auxiliary power generators.

It looked perfectly fine.

But that didn‚Äôt matter.

Because Dave‚Äôs mind had decided it needed fixing‚Äîand so did Cruns‚Äô.

He lunged at the control panel with both hands, prying open one of its access panels with surprising ease given how shaky his limbs were. Wires spilled out like entrails from some mechanical beast as Cruns dove into them without hesitation, pulling apart connections and rearranging components with reckless abandon.

""What are you doing?!"" someone shouted from behind him‚Äîa voice filled with panic and disbelief‚Äîbut Cruns barely registered it over the sound of his own racing thoughts.

""Fix it.""

""Make it better.""

""It‚Äôs broken.""

His hands moved faster than his brain could keep up with‚Äîrewiring circuits in ways that defied all logic or reason but somehow made perfect sense inside Dave‚Äôs mind (and by extension, Cruns‚Äô). Sparks flew from exposed wires as he jammed them together haphazardly, ignoring the growing smell of burning insulation that filled the air around him.

""Stop! You‚Äôre going to blow something up!"" another voice yelled frantically‚Äîbut again, Cruns didn‚Äôt hear them‚Äîor if he did, he didn‚Äôt care.

He was too far gone now‚Äîlost in that strange human compulsion to fix things even when they weren‚Äôt broken; to tinker with machinery just for the sake of tinkering; to ""improve"" things even when improvement wasn‚Äôt necessary or even possible.

And then... just as suddenly as it had begun... it was over.

Cruns stepped back from the control panel with a satisfied grin plastered across his face‚Äîa grin that wasn‚Äôt entirely his own but belonged just as much to Dave now too‚Äîand surveyed his handiwork proudly.

The control panel looked... different now.

Very different.

Wires hung loosely from where they‚Äôd been reattached using duct tape (because obviously), while several components had been rearranged into configurations that no engineer in their right mind would ever approve of‚Äîbut somehow... inexplicably... everything still worked.

In fact... it worked ""better"" than before.

The auxiliary power generator hummed quietly in the background‚Äîa low, steady hum that hadn‚Äôt been there before‚Äîas if whatever crazy modifications Cruns had made had actually improved its efficiency somehow (though no one could explain how or why).

The crew members who had gathered around watched in stunned silence as Cruns wiped sweat from his brow (or whatever part closest resembled a brow) and turned toward them with an air of smug satisfaction radiating off him like heat from a starship engine core.

""There,"" he declared triumphantly. ""All fixed.""

One brave soul finally stepped forward‚Äîa Xellian technician who looked like they were about two seconds away from either fainting or screaming‚Äîand stared at the control panel in disbelief before turning back to Cruns with wide eyes filled with equal parts awe and terror.

""How... how did you do that?"" they asked weakly.

Cruns shrugged nonchalantly‚Äîas if completely oblivious to how utterly insane everything about this situation actually was‚Äîand replied in a voice that sounded far too casual for someone who had just rewired half a power generator:

""I dunno. Just felt like it needed fixing.""

And with that... he turned on his heel and walked away without another word‚Äîleaving behind a group of thoroughly confused engineers who would spend weeks trying (and failing) to figure out exactly what kind of madness had just unfolded before their eyes...

\---

Cruns was a wreck. Not just the kind of wreck that could be fixed with a few hours of rest and some hydration gels. No, this was a full-blown, mind-melting, body-breaking catastrophe. His limbs twitched uncontrollably, his skin had settled into a permanent shade of alarming purple, and his eyes‚Äîhis four normally serene, calculating Vraxxi eyes‚Äîwere wide and bloodshot, like he hadn‚Äôt slept in days. Which, of course, he hadn‚Äôt.¬†

Because ""Dave"" didn‚Äôt need much sleep.

Cruns shuffled through the station‚Äôs corridors like a malfunctioning automaton, his legs moving in jerky, uneven steps as if they were no longer entirely under his control. His mind was a jumbled mess of conflicting urges and half-formed thoughts that weren‚Äôt even his own anymore. He could barely tell where ""he"" ended and Dave began.

It had been days‚Äî""days""‚Äîsince Cruns had first made the mistake of trying to read Dave Thompson‚Äôs mind. And now? Now he was paying the price for his hubris in ways he never could have imagined.

The coffee incident had been bad enough. The compulsive fixing spree had nearly gotten him thrown off the station. But this? This was something else entirely.

He could feel it building inside him‚Äîa pressure, an urge so strong it made his entire body ache with anticipation. It was another one of Dave‚Äôs strange human impulses, bubbling up from the depths of his subconscious like magma from an active volcano.

But this one wasn‚Äôt about coffee or fixing things or even duct tape.

No... this one was about ""running"".

Cruns stopped dead in his tracks as the realization hit him like a freight hauler slamming into an asteroid field. His eyes widened in horror as Dave‚Äôs thoughts surged to the forefront of his mind once again, filling his head with images of open fields and winding trails and humans sprinting for no apparent reason other than some bizarre concept they called ""exercise.""

""No,"" Cruns whispered, shaking his head violently as if that would somehow dislodge the thought from his brain. ""No, I‚Äôm not doing this.""

But Dave‚Äôs mind didn‚Äôt care what Cruns wanted.

The urge grew stronger with every passing second, pulsing through Cruns‚Äô body like an electric current until he could feel it in every muscle, every nerve ending, every fiber of his being.

He had to run.

""Why do humans ""do"" this?"" Cruns groaned aloud as he clutched at his head, trying desperately to hold onto whatever remained of his sanity. ""Why do they run for no reason?!""

But there was no answer‚Äîat least not one that made any sense to Cruns‚Äô frazzled Vraxxi brain. All he knew was that if he didn‚Äôt start running soon... something terrible would happen.

So he ran.

He didn‚Äôt want to‚Äîbut he did it anyway.

His legs moved on their own accord, propelling him forward at a speed that would have been impressive under normal circumstances but now felt like pure madness given how exhausted and broken he already was.

He sprinted down the corridor like a creature possessed‚Äîhis limbs flailing wildly as he careened around corners and dodged startled crew members who barely had time to jump out of his way before he barreled past them in a blur of purple skin and twitching muscles.

""Is that... Cruns?"" someone whispered as they watched him go by with wide eyes filled with disbelief.

""I think so,"" another voice replied hesitantly. ""But why is he running?""

""I have no idea.""

Neither did Cruns.

All he knew was that Dave‚Äôs mind had decided running was important‚Äî""vital"", even‚Äîand now Cruns was stuck carrying out that insane directive whether he liked it or not.

His heart pounded in his chest like it was trying to escape through his ribcage. His lungs burned with each ragged breath he took as sweat poured down his face in rivers. But still... he kept running.

Because stopping wasn‚Äôt an option anymore‚Äînot while Dave‚Äôs thoughts were still lodged inside his head like some kind of mental parasite feeding off whatever remained of Cruns‚Äô willpower.

He ran through corridors and up stairwells and across observation decks until finally‚Äîmercifully‚Äîhis body gave out completely.

With one final gasp for breath, Cruns collapsed onto the floor in a heap of trembling limbs and labored breathing, too exhausted to move another inch even if Dave‚Äôs mind demanded it (which thankfully it didn‚Äôt).

For several long moments, Cruns just lay there on the cold metal floor‚Äîhis chest rising and falling rapidly as he tried to catch his breath while simultaneously trying not to pass out from sheer exhaustion.

""Never again,"" he muttered weakly between gasps for air. ""I‚Äôm never doing that again.""

But deep down inside... somewhere beneath all those layers upon layers of human thoughts still swirling around inside his brain... Cruns knew better than to make promises like that anymore.

Because as long as Dave Thompson‚Äôs mind remained trapped inside ""his""... there would always be another urge waiting just around the corner‚Äîanother compulsion ready to take over at any moment without warning or explanation or mercy.

And Cruns wasn‚Äôt sure how much more of this insanity he could take before something finally snapped for good...

\---

Several hours later (or maybe minutes‚Äîit was hard to tell anymore), Cruns found himself back in the infirmary once again‚Äîthis time lying flat on one of those uncomfortable cots while several concerned-looking doctors hovered over him like vultures circling their prey.

""You‚Äôve really done it this time,"" one doctor muttered under their breath as they examined Cruns‚Äô vitals (which were still all over the place thanks to whatever cocktail of caffeine overload and human insanity had been coursing through his system for days now).

""I didn‚Äôt mean to,"" Cruns mumbled weakly in response‚Äîbut even ""he"" wasn‚Äôt sure what exactly he hadn‚Äôt meant to do anymore because everything had become such a blur lately that nothing made sense anymore except for one thing:

He needed help‚Äîand fast‚Äîbefore Dave Thompson‚Äôs mind drove him completely insane once and for all...

\---

Cruns lay on the infirmary cot, staring at the ceiling again. It had become his default position over the last few days‚Äîflat on his back, limbs limp, mind teetering on the edge of oblivion. His body was a battlefield of exhaustion and overstimulation, and his brain‚Ä¶ well, his brain was a warzone of human madness and Vraxxi logic, locked in a never-ending struggle for dominance.

He had tried everything‚Äîmeditation, deep breathing exercises, even some ancient Vraxxi mental techniques that were supposed to calm the mind and restore balance. None of it worked. Not while ""Dave"" was still rattling around inside his head like an over-caffeinated squirrel.

The medical staff had done their best. They‚Äôd run every test they could think of, poked and prodded him with various instruments, and even brought in a telepathic specialist from another species to try and sever the connection between Cruns and Dave‚Äôs mind. But nothing worked. The specialist had taken one look at Cruns‚Äô brain scan, muttered something about ""unprecedented neural entanglement,"" and promptly excused themselves from the room with a pale face.

So here Cruns was‚Äîtrapped in his own body, but not entirely in control of it.

And then it hit him.

Another ""urge"".

No. No, not again.

He could feel it bubbling up from the depths of Dave‚Äôs subconscious like some kind of malevolent force. It started as a faint itch at the back of his mind, then grew stronger with each passing second until it became impossible to ignore.

""Running again?"" Cruns thought in horror. ""More coffee? Fixing something?""

But no‚Ä¶ this was different.

This was something worse.

""Exercise.""

Cruns‚Äô eyes widened in terror as Dave‚Äôs thoughts flooded his mind once more‚Äîimages of humans lifting heavy objects for no reason, contorting their bodies into ridiculous positions, sweating profusely while grinning like maniacs as if they were enjoying it.

""No,"" Cruns whispered to himself, shaking his head violently as if that would somehow dislodge the thought from his brain. ""No way. I‚Äôm not doing this.""

But Dave‚Äôs mind didn‚Äôt care what Cruns wanted.

The urge grew stronger by the second, pulsing through Cruns‚Äô body like an electric current until he could feel it in every muscle, every nerve ending. His limbs twitched involuntarily as if they were preparing to spring into action without his consent.

He had to move. He had to ""exercise"".

""Not happening!"" Cruns growled through gritted teeth as he clenched his fists and tried to resist the compulsion with every ounce of willpower he had left‚Äîwhich wasn‚Äôt much at this point.

But resistance was futile.

Before he knew what was happening, Cruns found himself standing up from the cot‚Äîhis legs wobbling beneath him like they were made of jelly but somehow still carrying him forward toward the center of the infirmary where a few pieces of exercise equipment had been set up for patients who needed physical therapy.

""No‚Ä¶ no‚Ä¶ no‚Ä¶"" Cruns muttered under his breath as he approached one of the machines‚Äîa simple weight-lifting apparatus designed for light rehabilitation exercises but now looking like some kind of medieval torture device in Cruns‚Äô eyes.

He stared at it for a long moment‚Äîhis hands trembling at his sides as Dave‚Äôs mind screamed at him to ""lift"" something‚Ä¶ anything‚Ä¶ just ""do it"" already!

With a resigned sigh that sounded more like a death rattle than anything else, Cruns reached out and grabbed one of the weights‚Äîa small one that looked harmless enough but felt like it weighed a thousand tons in his trembling hands.

He lifted it once‚Ä¶ twice‚Ä¶ three times‚Ä¶

And then promptly dropped it onto the floor with an exhausted groan before collapsing onto the nearest chair with all the grace of a collapsing starship engine core.

""Why?"" Cruns gasped between labored breaths as sweat poured down his face. ""Why do humans ""do"" this?""

There was no answer‚Äîat least not one that made any sense to Cruns‚Äô frazzled Vraxxi brain. All he knew was that Dave‚Äôs mind had decided exercise was important‚Äîand now Cruns was stuck carrying out that insane directive whether he liked it or not.

\---

Cruns found himself back on the cot again‚Äîhis body aching in ways he didn‚Äôt even know were possible as he stared up at that same familiar ceiling with glazed-over eyes filled with exhaustion and defeat.

But then‚Ä¶ something changed.

It started small‚Äîjust a faint flicker at first‚Äîbut then grew stronger until Cruns could feel it clearly: ""the connection was weakening.""

For reasons beyond his understanding (and frankly beyond caring at this point), whatever strange mental link had formed between him and Dave Thompson‚Äôs mind was finally starting to unravel‚Äîto fray at its edges like an old piece of rope about to snap under too much strain.

Cruns blinked in surprise as he realized what was happening. Could it be? Was he finally going to be free?

He sat up slowly‚Äîcarefully‚Äîas if afraid that any sudden movement might cause the connection to snap back into place like some kind of cruel joke played by fate itself. But no‚Ä¶ it continued weakening‚Ä¶ unraveling‚Ä¶

And then‚Ä¶ with one final mental ""snap""‚Ä¶

It was gone.

Cruns gasped aloud as Dave‚Äôs thoughts vanished from his mind completely‚Äîleaving behind only blessed silence where there had once been chaos and madness and far too much caffeine-induced insanity for any one being to handle alone.

For several long moments, Cruns just sat there‚Äîstaring blankly ahead as he tried to process what had just happened. Was this real? Was he truly free?

A slow smile spread across his face‚Äîa smile that felt foreign after days (or weeks?) spent trapped inside someone else‚Äôs chaotic brain‚Äîbut oh how sweet that smile felt now‚Ä¶

""I‚Äôm free,"" Cruns whispered softly to himself before collapsing back onto the cot once more‚Äîthis time not out of exhaustion or defeat but out of pure relief as every muscle in his body finally relaxed for what felt like the first time in forever‚Ä¶

\---

Epilogue

03:00 Station time. Most of the station staff were in their sleep cycle. Dave got out of bed, walked down the hall towards engineering and out of sight of the stations cameras. He opened a panel in the bulkhead and retrieved a small device. He pressed his thumb to the screen and it lit up showing a prompt and a small onscreen keyboard.¬†

He typed,¬† ‚Äú287. Met a Vraxxi. Susceptible to mind lock.‚Äù

Moments later a replay came, ‚ÄúUnderstood. Continue observation and reporting. -UEC‚Äù

The city was different, and at its center stood the Foundry Bookstore. It offered a place where everyone felt safe, with sunlight and artificial light streaming down through the tall, two-story building. It was a place of imagination, growth, and escape‚Äîone that didn‚Äôt smell of paper or ink, but like the resinous warmth of northern pinecones in autumn. Shelves lined the aisles in a diagonal pattern, stopping just short of the walls, completely filled with books whose glossy spines and covers caught the eye of every passerby. Adults and children laughed, smiled, or even wept, their emotions shared and bound to the stories in their hands.

A month into his new job at TechUse, Harper had already been labeled a prodigy in the Artificial Intelligence community. Yet he was stumped and required the assistance of a book: Underestimating Artificial Intelligence by Howard Lox. He passed rows upon rows‚ÄîFiction, History, Fantasy, and ‚ÄúEmployee Favorites‚Äù‚Äîuntil he spotted a sign pointing to a small section tucked past the coffee shop on the left. Of course, he thought. The setup was a clever sales tactic, thoughtfully placing the freshly grounded beans directly in the path of caffeine-craving customers.

As he walked, the strong scent of the brew was impossible to ignore. No matter how much he tried, it pulled his attention to the shop‚Äîand to a woman who stood out like a flame, her vibrant red hair cascading down her back, flowing like molten lava.

Harper‚Äôs gaze lingered too long‚Äîlong enough that she caught him staring, her jaded eyes a beautiful balance to her hair. Already mid-step, it was too late to stop what happened next. He collided with a display stacked with a pyramid of tumblers. They leaned and wobbled before toppling over one another and crashing onto the floor, landing with an echoing clatter that would have made a librarian cry. Nearby shoppers shot irritated glances, some muttering under their breath, but not her. She gave him a quick, amused smile before turning toward the register.",1,1731986576.0,writers,1,1.0,False

1gunqaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/1gunqaw/extreme_hungerweight_redistributionother_weird/,Extreme Hunger/Weight Redistribution/Other weird stuff,"Here's a quick rundown of my situation first:

About a year and a half ago, summer of 2023, I started restricting. By that December I confessed to my parents about having an ED, and I immediately began eating a ""normal"" amount of food again. I had 1 very light period, but by the end of winter I was back to restricting again, not at the extreme level I once had, but I was monitoring my intake and making sure I was staying under my maintenance level. This carried on until recently, when my parents pushed me to start trying to gain weight so my period would start again.

Every day, I wake up, eat breakfast and have some coffee, then proceed with my morning until about a couple hours later, when I start to feel EXTREMELY hungry. Today, for example, I ate a good portion of food for lunch, but it did nothing to ease my hunger. Ended up eating a bunch of trail mix, Goldfish, a pumpkin roll dessert, some peanut butter granola, only to feel somewhat satiated, though my stomach is very obviously bloated from having such a large volume over a short time frame.

I know it's slightly different for everyone, but will this go away as I gain weight/stay consistent with eating? Should I respond to every hunger cue, even if I've just eaten? When this does go away, does that mean my period is close to restarting? And will the bloating stop/weight redistribute with time?

It all just feels so weird. I want to get back to normal ASAP, but it feels like I'm never going to be able to stop eating at the moment. Some guidance/experience sharing would be much appreciated :)",2,1731986486.0,AnorexiaNervosa,1,1.0,False

We met in our graduate program as we are both going to be teachers soon. I thought she was really pretty in class so I messaged her and asked her out for some coffee. A few days go by and Tuesday rolls around and we meet at the Starbucks on campus. She shows up and I have her stupid over priced drink already paid for and she has the most gorgeous smile. We were supposed to sit down and study and do work together, but we ended up talking instead for hours without even realizing how fast the time flew by. During this first date we got to know each other very well, we had so much in common it was actually kind of scary, from small things like sharing a favourite food, to big things like past trauma or having adhd and heart conditions. She also had a heart Made of gold, she is so compassionate, empathetic, and just a beautiful person inside and out. After the coffee date we walked back to class and I knew that I had to see this girl again, I knew I was going to date this girl. I messaged her shortly after that date to ask her out on another one for the following Friday. She said she would love to see me again so that same Friday I drove up to see her, (I live about an hour and a half away from campus). That Friday I picked her up she looked amazing, I couldn‚Äôt tell her enough how pretty she was. We ended up at the bowling alley where we played for about a half an hour, I was smiling the entire time watching her wear these mom jeans where every time she threw the bowling ball she was trying to keep her pants from falling down. After bowling we played some pool and then left to go get something to eat at her favourite restaurant. The entire night was full of laughter and great conversation. After we left the restaurant we went to Dairy Queen. This is when I knew she was the one for me. We had a very deep conversation in my car while sharing a blizzard and she opened up to me about her past relationship. I was envious and still am of her ex boyfriend, but with time i will end up getting over this. the way she was mistreated hurt my heart because this girl is as pure as gold gets. I‚Äôm so lucky that she felt comfortable enough to share this with me. After we finished our blizzard i took her home and in her driveway is where she kissed me for the very first time, and is when i knew for sure that i was in love. I went home that night and i told my mom when i walked through the door ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to marry this girl someday‚Äù and i went to bed as happy as i have ever been. fast forward a week and a half and i am here now laying in bed thinking of her. I asked her to be my girlfriend this weekend and she said yes. we spent all weekend together bonding and doing stupid things i would have thought were corny if i wasn‚Äôt in love. Now I‚Äôm just happy to be with her. We don‚Äôt have a sexual relationship yet as she says she doesn‚Äôt like to rush into having sex which is fine with me, because i love her regardless of the sex. But i think this is why i am so envious of the people before me. because i want that connection those people had. anyways, I know it is super early into our relationship, but i know that this is what love feels like and I‚Äôm pretty sure she loves me back.

We have really similar taste in books and I‚Äôve been going there and we‚Äôve been chatting about books/tattoos/classes etc. for a few months now. 

I have genuinely no idea whether he‚Äôs been flirty with me or just very friendly. I lean towards just friendly, but I‚Äôm awful at telling the difference. 

The point is, I‚Äôd like to ask him for coffee, but I haven‚Äôt for a couple of reasons. 

1. I don‚Äôt love the idea of asking someone out at their workplace. For me, personally, I don‚Äôt mind at all so long as it‚Äôs done respectfully but I know a lot of people do and I reallyyyyyy don‚Äôt want to be weird. 

2. I feel like, if I was thin and conventionally pretty, even if he wasn‚Äôt interested he‚Äôd at least be flattered or neutral that I asked. Considering I‚Äôm fat (size 18/20) and my face is not typically considered pretty, I‚Äôm VERY worried that he would be weirded/grossed out by me asking. Which would be made even worse, because, per point 1, this is where he works. 

I‚Äôve spent the majority of my life convinced that I am disgusting and rotten on the inside and outside (blegh childhood stuff) and am only recently beginning to chill out about that. I don‚Äôt want his (potential) grossed out reaction to set me back and I also really don‚Äôt wanna be a weirdo.

The last time I didn‚Äôt eat was 30 days a year ago. I drank water, cola, green tea, and random drinks.

Usually, I don't eat for 2 to 4 days, which is generally called fasting. But I just don't eat. My body naturally gets hot. Now in winter, I always wear short sleeves when I go out.

.

Some people don‚Äôt eat for more than a year but only drink coffee or meditate and practice. There is no real evidence.

But I am just an ordinary person. I can bask in the sun or stay indoors. It is very ordinary. I believe this can be studied.

But no one in Taiwan has done anything. If only the United States might have a forward-looking vision for the future.

.

If humans don‚Äôt eat, this is the next stage of evolution, but 80% of the current economy will collapse.

I have a special constitution and I don‚Äôt want to waste this time. I may leave a record that will be used thousands or thousands of years later.

I am now asking anyone who has a non-eating experimental laboratory in the United States or is interested in doing so to contact me.

.

Babies absorb liquid food to grow, and the soft flesh of the adult esophagus absorbs solid food.

No matter how much damage is caused to both sides, the teeth can still be maintained by chewing gum, but the damage to the body is difficult.

.

I have tried dyeing my fingers, and the color gradually disappears after entering the pores. The plants will feel that the radio waves are different when people enter the room. It needs machine verification to let everyone know.

It shows that the human body still has great unknown potential. It is possible not to eat, but to contact food with thoughts to transform kinetic energy.

.

It is difficult to change habits after billions of years, but someone will always do experiments and research to find a better way to evolve.

As the body absorbs it, it will gradually fade away like stained paint. Whether we can avoid eating it remains to be seen through experiments. But how many people can avoid eating it?

.

Think about the Olympic Games, Formula One racing... these great achievements are made by the best human resources, using extremely high resources to push forward the ultimate progress.

Even if you don‚Äôt eat, there is still a long way to go in human progress. I am just passing through a relay station.

.



The economy is turning towards a general direction of development, and people are no longer just obsessed with eating, hoping that someone will recommend a fasting experiment.

Knowing that applying for a budget can take up to a year, the solicitation period is extended to two years.

.

Hopefully, there will be two companies or foundations, and they will be on opposing sides, like the Democratic and Republican parties,

To ensure the authenticity of the experiment, it is best to have three or more companies conduct the experiment together, and the entire process will be broadcast live on YouTube.

Fake names for obvious reasons. Also I‚Äôm so sorry how long this got :(¬†

I (18f) went to a club last weekend with a group of friends one of which included Jimmy (19m). Jimmy was talking with me before we went in about what classes I was taking next semester. I told him I hadn‚Äôt done my registration yet but would try to this week. Jimmy told me I should join a certain class because Ben (19m) would be in it and I could try to ask him out.

For context, a couple months earlier, Ben (a friend of Jimmy‚Äôs) had hit on me a couple times and I rejected him but eventually I asked if he wanted to grab coffee which he agreed to. However, we cancelled and never ended up rescheduling. Right after this I started talking to Anthony (18m) and I have really started to like him. So when Jimmy suggested this, I told him I‚Äôd check out the class but I wasn‚Äôt interested in Ben since Anthony and I are talking so much. Jimmy kept pressing and asking ‚Äúeven if Ben asked you out you would say no?‚Äù and I kept replying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really not interested in Ben so I‚Äôm not going out with him.‚Äù

We get in the club and Jimmy is clearly in a bad mood being tense to our friends and just acting weird. At one point, Jimmy looks at me and asks ‚ÄúIf you and Ben were in the same class together do you think you would have a hard time being professional with him?‚Äù This catches me off guard and I ask why that would be an issue. Jimmy goes on to tell me since I had a ‚Äúthing‚Äù with Ben it may be difficult for me to work closely with him without getting emotional. This gets me really pissed and I keep reiterating I‚Äôm not into Ben and my personal and school/work life are two separate things entirely. I told him if anyone made it unprofessional it sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt be me not to mention I am already interested in someone else.

On top of all this, the field I‚Äôm studying is male dominated making this comment more offensive to me because I don‚Äôt think Jimmy would ask that kind of question to a guy. I would‚Äôve said more to Jimmy in the moment had we not been in such a busy space (especially considering he was interested in a classmate but it didn‚Äôt work out) but I think going back and trying to retroactively talk with him may make things worse. I‚Äôm also very bad when it comes to confrontation and tend to bottle things up best I can. I feel like I may be the asshole for overreacting about the whole thing since I doubt he meant it to come across that way but I‚Äôm really bothered.

She also had periods beforehand where she drank and then stopped cold turkey. She would also get black out drunk and take prescribed medications like ambien, trazedone, etc. As far as I know she doesn‚Äôt take the sleeping pills, but she also smokes and takes several other prescription meds. 

About four-five years ago, she had to have surgery last minute to get her gallbladder taken out. I've never been sure if it was related or not.

In July, she had severe pain in her kidney area and urine the color of coffee/tea. I took her to an emergency room and they said she had a kidney infection. Then they said she didn‚Äôt, and diagnosed her with sciatic pain (terrible hospital!!) That hospital did a scan to look at her organs and said everything looked healthy. I ended up having to take her to another emergency room the next day where they treated her for a kidney infection and the (horrid) symptoms went away. At the second hospital, all they did was pull her records from the previous visit and treat her for the infection. As far as I know, the symptoms went away. 

I've seen her sweat profusely in cool temps for years. I'm always freezing cold in her house/car and she still is hot. Recently, in August, we were in a nail salon and she had this random episode where she had shortness of breath, turned red all over, and got super hot/ sweaty. It scared me‚ÄîI thought she was going to have a stroke. She insisted she was fine though and eventually the episode went away. She has high blood pressure and takes two medications for it. That same day or a few days later, she called me because she forgot her bank pin. She has had the pin for longer than she‚Äôs been drinking (14 years). 

Over the past three to four years, she‚Äôs developed severe diarrhea. She will have to completely stop what she‚Äôs doing and run to the bathroom. Overall gassy, belching, etc. She also gets itchy all over. 

Recently she had bloodwork done. It's through her job, so it's not with her PCP or anything. She told me her liver enzymes were high, and that she wanted to get sober. But her plan is to cut back on alcohol now (I‚Äôve heard this before) & get sober in January, because she insists on not missing work‚Ä¶ she went to her doctor to figure out how to get sober. Her doctor told her it would take two weeks to detox. So my mom plans to take vacation time, detox, and go right back to work in January. It could definitely be a step in the right direction, however she‚Äôs been telling me the entire 14 years she‚Äôll get sober. And the plan ahead thing & not taking medical leave makes me very weary. 

I saw her most recently, two days ago, and she was glistening with sweat & hot. I may have caught a whiff of the musty liver smell? I felt she was acting strange. We have been on the rocks because of her addiction but have made up before this. She kept walking off from me, and getting lost in the store basically. My grandma did this when she started to decline mentally from Alzheimer‚Äôs. 

She also has said that she is sick and has a very, very bad cough where she is hacking stuff up. Not sure what. 

Two of her siblings died before they were 60 because of drug abuse‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm absolutely terrified she doesn‚Äôt have much longer. 

tl;dr I‚Äôm worried my moms liver is failing and she will take a rapid turn. She has itchy skin, spider veins, extreme diarrhea, a kidney infection, shortness of breath, overheating & sweating, forgetfulness & confusion. ",1,1731985356.0,alcoholism,9,1.0,False

Imagine staring at a blank page of possibility, wondering if you‚Äôll ever find the person who‚Äôs meant for you. That was me‚Äînot too long ago. I‚Äôd spent years searching for that one connection, someone who wouldn‚Äôt just *fit* into my life but amplify it. After countless dead-end dates and surface-level conversations, my faith in the ""soulmate"" concept had faded to a flicker. And then, everything changed.

I came across something that promised not just hope but *clarity*. A product claiming to sketch your soulmate felt like a gamble‚Äîhalf romantic leap, half internet-age novelty. Skeptical but intrigued, I dove in. What did I have to lose? The process was simple. I answered a few detailed questions about myself, my personality, and even some of my preferences. It didn‚Äôt feel invasive; it felt intentional, almost like talking to someone who truly wanted to understand me.

When the sketch arrived, my jaw dropped. It wasn‚Äôt just a face on paper; it was *the face.* Something about it resonated on a deep, almost indescribable level. The eyes seemed alive, holding a silent promise of understanding. There was a calm, an energy, a sense of familiarity that I couldn‚Äôt shake. But here‚Äôs where it gets wild‚Äîthis wasn‚Äôt just an impressive piece of art. This sketch sparked action.

The product didn‚Äôt just stop at the drawing. It came with insights‚Äîwhere I might meet this person, how I‚Äôd feel when I did, and even the kinds of conversations that would unfold. At first, I brushed it off. I mean, come on‚Äîa sketch predicting the future? But something deep inside whispered, ""What if?""

Armed with curiosity, I started paying closer attention to my surroundings. It wasn‚Äôt about chasing fate but staying open to it. I frequented places I usually overlooked‚Äîa quaint coffee shop near my office, a local library I hadn‚Äôt visited in years. And then, one random Thursday, it happened.

I was standing in line for coffee when I noticed someone ahead of me. Their silhouette, the tilt of their head‚Äîit was the sketch come to life. My heart raced as if it had been preparing for this moment. Summoning courage I didn‚Äôt know I had, I struck up a conversation. We talked for hours that day, and everything‚Äîthe energy, the familiarity, the *connection*‚Äîaligned perfectly.

Now, here‚Äôs the kicker: it wasn‚Äôt just the face that matched. It was the *experience.* The moment played out almost exactly as described in the accompanying insights. The warmth in their voice, the shared laughter over something mundane, the immediate sense of belonging‚Äîit all mirrored the prediction.

Today, I look back and marvel at how one decision reshaped my life. It wasn‚Äôt about ""finding love"" in the way dating apps or matchmaking services promise. It was about tuning into a deeper sense of alignment and trusting that the universe had a plan. That sketch didn‚Äôt just give me a visual; it gave me hope and direction when I needed it most.

If you‚Äôre on the fence, skeptical, or think this sounds too good to be true, I get it. I was you. But sometimes, life has a funny way of surprising you when you‚Äôre willing to take the first step. For me, that step wasn‚Äôt just toward someone else‚Äîit was toward the life I‚Äôd always dreamed of.

Trust me, the best stories don‚Äôt happen by accident. They happen when you decide you‚Äôre ready for them. This? This was my story. Maybe it could be yours, too.

What makes this story even more incredible isn‚Äôt just the emotional journey‚Äîit‚Äôs the underlying science and psychology that gives a product like this its edge. At first glance, you might think, ""How can a sketch of a face have any real bearing on who I‚Äôm destined to meet?"" But dig deeper, and you‚Äôll find that it‚Äôs not just about the art; it‚Äôs about how the mind processes familiarity, attraction, and intention.

Psychologists have long studied the phenomenon of facial recognition and its impact on human connection. Our brains are wired to pick up subtle cues in faces, from symmetry to expressions, that signal trustworthiness, compatibility, and even shared emotional states. The sketch I received wasn‚Äôt some random image; it was carefully crafted to tap into these subconscious triggers.

Experts often talk about the ""mere-exposure effect,"" a psychological principle that suggests we are more likely to be drawn to things that feel familiar. When I first saw the sketch, I didn‚Äôt consciously think, ""This is my soulmate."" Instead, something deeper clicked‚Äîa sense of recognition that bypassed logic. That‚Äôs the genius of this product. It‚Äôs not just about showing you a face; it‚Äôs about aligning that image with what your mind already knows you‚Äôre drawn to, even if you don‚Äôt realize it yet.

Then there‚Äôs the role of intention. Visualization techniques have been used for decades by top athletes, successful entrepreneurs, and those seeking personal transformation. By focusing on a clear mental picture of what you want‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs success, health, or love‚Äîyou subconsciously align your actions and decisions to achieve it. The soulmate sketch functions as a powerful visualization tool, giving you a tangible representation of the connection you‚Äôre seeking. When I saw that sketch, I wasn‚Äôt just given hope; I was given focus.

And let‚Äôs not overlook the biological component. Researchers have shown that attraction isn‚Äôt purely random‚Äîit‚Äôs deeply influenced by our evolutionary preferences, social conditioning, and even genetic markers. A skilled artist, working with information about your personality and preferences, can create a face that harmonizes with these hidden cues. That‚Äôs what made the sketch so compelling‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt just a generic ""ideal,"" but a deeply personal reflection of what I was truly looking for.

This is where the real magic happens: when science and creativity intersect. The sketch serves as a catalyst, helping you recognize and act on opportunities you might otherwise overlook. It bridges the gap between what your heart desires and what your mind can see, creating a roadmap for connection that feels as natural as it does extraordinary.

I think back to that moment in the coffee shop often. Was it fate? Was it science? Maybe it was both. What I do know is that without that sketch, I might never have recognized the opportunity standing right in front of me. It wasn‚Äôt just about predicting my soulmate; it was about unlocking my own ability to see and embrace what was possible.

Science or magic‚Äîcall it what you will. For me, it was life-changing. And for anyone willing to take the leap, it could be the same for you.

**1. How does Soul Gaze Sketch work?**  
It‚Äôs a blend of artistry and insight. You provide details about yourself‚Äîyour personality, preferences, and a few other key traits. Using this information, the artist creates a sketch that reflects what your soulmate could look like. But it doesn‚Äôt stop there; you also receive insights about where and how you might meet this person, adding depth to the experience.

**2. What if I don‚Äôt believe in soulmates?**  
That‚Äôs okay! You don‚Äôt have to believe in ""destiny"" to benefit from this. Think of the sketch as a tool for clarity and focus. Even if you‚Äôre skeptical about the concept of soulmates, the process helps you visualize what you want in a partner and sparks the kind of openness and curiosity that leads to deeper connections.

**3. How accurate are the sketches?**  
Here‚Äôs the truth: the sketches aren‚Äôt meant to be perfect snapshots of someone‚Äôs face. Instead, they tap into the traits and features that your subconscious mind is naturally drawn to. In my case, the resemblance between the sketch and the person I met was uncanny‚Äîbut beyond looks, it captured the energy and essence of the connection I was seeking.

**4. What if I don‚Äôt recognize the person?**  
That‚Äôs part of the beauty. Sometimes, the person in the sketch isn‚Äôt someone you‚Äôve met yet. It could be a guide to recognize opportunities when they arise. And if the face doesn‚Äôt resonate immediately, the insights about where and how you might meet your soulmate could point you in the right direction.

**5. Is it worth the investment?**  
This was my biggest hesitation. But looking back, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth every penny. It‚Äôs not just about the sketch‚Äîit‚Äôs about the confidence and excitement it brings. The process helped me see what I was truly looking for and gave me the motivation to find it. Honestly, can you put a price on something that could change your life?

**6. What if I don‚Äôt meet my soulmate right away?**  
Patience is key. The sketch and insights aren‚Äôt a magic wand; they‚Äôre a guide. Meeting the right person takes time and readiness. For me, it didn‚Äôt happen the next day, but when it did, I knew instantly because I‚Äôd taken the steps to prepare myself emotionally and mentally.

**7. Can anyone use this service?**

However, it was only those two rounds out of five(?) rounds. I've been a slacker four times and a specialist turned manager once. The rounds I enjoyed were one of the slacker rounds and the specialist round, but the remaining three slacker rounds went from midly okay to wtf this isn't a serious lobby??? As one round, the game just STARTED, and I went to draw a picture and got told I was playing too many games than working (I didn't even get any game tasks?) to which I lightly joked saying that ""drawing is a game you uncultured swine"" and the guy reported me two the manger and I got voted, like wtf I didn't get to do anything but it was ""justified"" because I was a slacker...

Now, not all servers are like this, but damn it made me really, despite getting the slacker role as no matter what I do most of the time, I barely get to do anything before I hear someone trying to convince the manager to vote me out.

Connections within.,"An ancient entity that spends years lurking amongst humanity, infesting a body that was not its own. One connected to consuming entire worlds with black holes to sate an unending hunger that also empowers it. Summoning said black holes for combat.

Part of the scheme to consume the worlds involved spreading their power out, where it grows within others-including the foes that lead to its downfall. 

The advent of this entity's full power suddenly brings the combat to a whole new level of bombast, with DBZ style insanity taking place when fights were mostly fairly flashy but isolated before. 

Consumption of a planet happens on screen, with the threat of the planet the series takes place on being key to the finale of the shows. 

And the entity gets pretty...*quirky* with how they talk. 

  
Essentially, the Blood Tribe member named Evolto (the final villain of Kamen Rider Build) and Cyn (the Final Villain of Murder Drones) would make an EXCELLENT matchup.

1gun9gw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScaryStory/comments/1gun9gw/the_perfect_wife/,The Perfect Wife,"Before you dive into this tale, know that my whispers reach beyond the page. All of my stories- woven in shadows and whispered for the sleepless- await you on YouTube. There, I guide you through the darkest dreams and deepest fears, one story at a time. Seek me out as Mr. Sandman and let the darkness speak to you. Let's begin.

Laura Grayson was the kind of woman everyone admired. In her small town, she seemed to have it all: a beautiful home, two adorable children, and a charming, successful husband named Darren. She was the mother who always volunteered for bake sales, who showed up at PTA meetings with fresh coffee for everyone, and who had an endless supply of warm smiles and gracious conversation. But the truth was, Laura was trapped.

For years, her life had been an unending cycle of control and criticism from Darren, who was respected around town as a charismatic businessman. Behind closed doors, he was cold, calculating, and methodically cruel. He controlled the family‚Äôs money, monitoring every purchase she made. He criticized her every move, calling her lazy and incompetent. Her friends had stopped calling, and Darren made sure she knew it was because she wasn‚Äôt worth anyone‚Äôs time. Isolation became her reality, and she buried her pain beneath the facade of perfection.

Then one evening, Laura noticed a strange charge on their credit card statement‚Äîa luxury hotel stay on a weekend when Darren had been ‚Äúout of town for business.‚Äù Her heart raced as she thought back to that weekend and realized he‚Äôd never called, never checked in on her or the kids. Suspicion gnawed at her, and she waited until he was asleep, then quietly took his phone from the nightstand and unlocked it, hands trembling.

The messages she found confirmed her darkest fears. Darren had been having an affair with April, her closest friend. The two of them had been sneaking around for months, exchanging messages about the thrill of secrecy, mocking her, even sharing intimate details of her life and her insecurities. Laura felt the ground fall out from under her. She had been humiliated, used, and dismissed by the people she trusted most.

The next day, Laura confronted Darren, her voice barely containing the anger boiling inside her. But Darren didn‚Äôt flinch. He simply shrugged, looked her straight in the eye, and told her that he was done pretending. He blamed her for the affair, said she was pathetic, a failure of a wife. As he turned his back on her and went upstairs, Laura felt something inside her snap.

In the days that followed, Laura‚Äôs mind became a whirlwind of rage and dark thoughts. She had given everything to this man‚Äîher love, her loyalty, her very identity‚Äîand he had taken it all without a second thought. At first, she only thought of confronting April, to demand an explanation and maybe some sign of regret. But each night she stayed awake, staring at the ceiling, imagining their faces, the betrayal in their eyes, her anger grew sharper.

One cold November evening, after Darren had gone to bed, Laura went down to the basement, where Darren had stashed his old tools. She found a rusted hammer, heavy and solid, and felt its weight in her hand. She wasn‚Äôt sure if she had the nerve to go through with what she was thinking. But every time she pictured Darren‚Äôs dismissive face and April‚Äôs mocking texts, her resolve hardened.

Just after midnight, Laura slipped out of the house, hammer in hand, and drove the few blocks to April‚Äôs. She rehearsed what she would say, imagining April‚Äôs shock, her panic. When she reached April‚Äôs door, she tried to calm herself, wiping the sweat from her brow, steadying her breathing. When April opened the door, she looked surprised but quickly smiled, assuming Laura was stopping by for a friendly chat. Laura forced a smile back and whispered, ‚ÄúCan I come in? I just need to talk.‚Äù

Once inside, Laura dropped the friendly pretense. Her voice grew cold, and her expression twisted with anger. ‚ÄúHow could you?‚Äù she asked, venom dripping from every word. ‚ÄúI trusted you. I thought you were my friend.‚Äù

April‚Äôs face paled, and she stammered, trying to explain herself, but Laura didn‚Äôt want to hear it. Her grip tightened around the hammer, and in a moment of blind rage, she swung it, feeling the impact reverberate through her arm. The room was filled with April‚Äôs screams, but Laura‚Äôs fury had numbed her to everything else.

By the time the night was over, Laura was exhausted, physically and mentally. She left April‚Äôs house in a daze, covered in blood and without a plan. She hadn‚Äôt thought beyond this moment, and now the consequences loomed over her like a shadow.

The next morning, Darren reported her missing, claiming he had no idea where his wife was. He played the concerned husband, even giving teary interviews to the local news. But as the investigation unfolded, detectives began to notice small inconsistencies in Darren‚Äôs story. And when they found April‚Äôs body, it didn‚Äôt take long for them to find Laura‚Äôs fingerprints on the weapon.

When they finally tracked Laura down, she was hiding in an abandoned cabin just outside town, her mind shattered and her body gaunt from days without sleep. She didn‚Äôt fight when they put her in handcuffs. The woman the world had known as the perfect wife and mother was gone, replaced by a hollow shell.

As the trial began, people flocked to the courtroom, unable to believe that Laura Grayson, the beloved face of their community, had committed such a brutal act. But as the details of Darren‚Äôs infidelity and abuse came to light, sympathy grew for Laura. Some people even saw her as a victim, a woman who had been driven to her breaking point. Others thought she was just as cold and calculating murderer!

In the end, Laura‚Äôs sentence would be life in prison. Her children, left without a mother and in the quiet town where Laura had once been a beacon of grace and goodness, her story became a cautionary tale‚Äîa dark reminder of what can happen when a person, even someone you think you know, is pushed too far.",1,1731985024.0,ScaryStory,3,1.0,False

it started small‚Äîlittle things i‚Äôd brush off as coincidences. like, i‚Äôd be walking home, and i‚Äôd see the same car parked a block away from my house two or three times in a row. or i‚Äôd notice someone standing too close behind me in line at the store, staring at me just a little too long.

then it got worse. i started noticing things around my house. the gate in my backyard, which i always lock, was left open one night. another time, i found footprints in the mud right under my kitchen window. my roommate thinks it‚Äôs just a neighbor‚Äôs dog or some delivery guy, but it doesn‚Äôt feel like that.

i started taking different routes home, but no matter what, i feel like there‚Äôs always someone behind me. once, i swear i saw the same guy at two different places on the same day‚Äîfirst at the coffee shop and then later outside my gym. what are the chances of that?

i‚Äôve thought about calling the police, but what do i even say? ""hi, i think someone‚Äôs watching me but i have no proof""? they‚Äôd laugh me off the phone.

the scariest part? a couple of nights ago, i got home late and there was this weird mark on my door, like someone had tried to pick the lock. nothing was stolen, thank god, but it freaked me out so much that i barely slept that night. i‚Äôve been sleeping with the lights on ever since.

i feel trapped. i don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs all in my head or if i‚Äôm actually in danger. all i know is, i don‚Äôt feel safe in my own home anymore, and it‚Äôs the worst feeling in the world.

**The Final Sortie - Part 1**

Colonel Jack ‚ÄúHawkeye‚Äù Harris stared at the photo on his desk, a cherished relic of his early days. The photo, dog-eared and slightly faded, showed him in his first fighter jet, grinning like a schoolboy, his helmet tucked under one arm, and the sun glinting off the metal fuselage behind him. His desk was nestled in the corner of his modest but warm living room, a place that carried the weight of a life well-lived. The wood-paneled walls bore marks of time, lined with shelves filled with books on aviation, framed medals, and photos of Jack with his squadron, each image telling a story of camaraderie and sacrifice.

Beyond the wide bay window, the late afternoon sun bathed the quiet cul-de-sac in a golden glow. Jack‚Äôs small suburban home sat at the end of the street, its neatly trimmed lawn bordered by rose bushes his late wife, Karen, had planted years ago. The faint hum of a neighbor‚Äôs lawnmower drifted through the air, mingling with the distant laughter of children riding their bikes.

Jack turned his gaze to the mantel above the brick fireplace, where a carefully arranged collection of family photos resided. His eyes lingered on one picture in particular‚Äîa snapshot of Mia, his daughter, taken during her college graduation. She had Karen‚Äôs smile and Jack‚Äôs piercing blue eyes, a combination that always caught him off guard. Now a teacher, Mia had moved back home temporarily to help her dad ease into civilian life, though Jack suspected she was more worried about his adjustment than he let on.

Tomorrow, he‚Äôd hang up his flight suit for good. The thought felt surreal, like stepping into a world that moved slower and quieter than the one he‚Äôd known. Retirement was waiting, and so was Mia, who‚Äôd been counting down the days with a mix of excitement and nervousness. Jack sighed, his fingers brushing the edge of the photo on his desk. He had spent so much of his life in the skies; the idea of being grounded still felt foreign. But this house, this family‚Äîthis was his new mission.

¬†The call came at 5:00 AM, just hours before the planned retirement ceremony. The shrill, insistent buzz of his phone shattered the stillness of the early morning, pulling Jack out of a restless sleep. He sat up abruptly, the weight of thirty years in the cockpit reflected in the stiffness of his back and shoulders. The room was dim, the faint glow of streetlights filtering through the blinds casting long shadows across the walls. His nightstand was cluttered with remnants of his life on the edge of two worlds: a dog-eared flight manual, a half-empty glass of water, and a framed photo of him and Mia from her high school graduation.

Groaning, Jack rubbed the grit from his eyes, his mind struggling to bridge the gap between sleep and the reality of the call. His hand fumbled across the nightstand before landing on the vibrating phone. The screen's harsh light pierced the darkness, and his squinting eyes focused on the single word displayed on the caller ID:¬†**COMMAND**.

The sight of it sent a flicker of unease through him. It had been months since a call from command interrupted his private life, and he had hoped those days were behind him. The looming ceremony, the culmination of his long career, was supposed to mark the end of these early-morning summonses. For a moment, he debated letting it ring, but old habits died hard. With a resigned sigh, he swiped to answer, his voice gravelly from sleep.

‚ÄúHarris,‚Äù he said, his tone a mix of professionalism and irritation, knowing that whatever awaited on the other end of the line wasn‚Äôt going to make the morning any easier.

‚ÄúColonel Harris, this is General Maddox,‚Äù came the voice on the other end of the line, calm but tinged with urgency.

Jack frowned, rubbing his face as he tried to shake off the remnants of sleep. He swung his legs over the edge of the bed and glanced at the faintly glowing clock on his nightstand. Five o‚Äôclock. Typical. ‚ÄúMorning, General,‚Äù Jack said, his voice flat. ‚ÄúWhat can I do for you that couldn‚Äôt wait until sunrise?‚Äù

Maddox chuckled lightly, though it lacked his usual warmth. ‚ÄúStill as sharp as ever, I see. How‚Äôs civilian life treating you, Jack? Or is it too soon to ask?‚Äù

‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt know yet,‚Äù Jack replied dryly. ‚ÄúStill officially on the clock for another twenty-four hours. Thought I might get to enjoy a peaceful morning for once, but here we are.‚Äù

There was a pause, the kind that told Jack this wasn‚Äôt a social call. Maddox cleared his throat. ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôll have plenty of peaceful mornings soon enough. Look, I wouldn‚Äôt call if it wasn‚Äôt important.‚Äù

Jack leaned forward, his elbows resting on his knees. ‚ÄúGeneral, with all due respect, I‚Äôm out. This is someone else‚Äôs turn. I‚Äôve earned my time off.‚Äù

Maddox sighed, his tone shifting, becoming uncharacteristically somber. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt optional, Jack. It‚Äôs routine‚Äîjust recon. Nothing dangerous. But you‚Äôre the only one who knows this airspace like the back of your hand. We‚Äôve got something unusual out near the Alaskan coast, and the drones aren‚Äôt giving us the clarity we need. It‚Äôll be in and out, quick and clean.‚Äù

Jack ran a hand through his graying hair, his shoulders sagging. ‚ÄúGeneral, I‚Äôve spent the last thirty years putting my life on the line. Can‚Äôt someone else handle this? I‚Äôve got a ceremony tomorrow, and my daughter‚Äôs been planning it for weeks. You know how she gets.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù Maddox said, his voice softening slightly. ‚ÄúMia‚Äôs a good kid. Karen would be proud of her. And believe me, I wouldn‚Äôt be calling you if I had another option. But we‚Äôre stretched thin right now‚Äîhalf the squadron‚Äôs deployed, and the rest aren‚Äôt trained for these conditions. You‚Äôre the best man for the job, Jack. Hell, you wrote the book on this kind of mission.‚Äù

Jack‚Äôs jaw tightened. He didn‚Äôt like being called the ‚Äúbest man‚Äù anymore; it felt like a polite way of saying ‚Äúindispensable enough to keep dragging into the fire.‚Äù He let out a long breath, staring at the darkened window across the room. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me you‚Äôve got no one else?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one I trust,‚Äù Maddox admitted. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a combat op. It‚Äôs routine. You‚Äôll be home in time to put on your dress blues and make Mia proud.‚Äù

Jack was silent for a long moment. His eyes settled on a model of his old F-16 that Mia had built for him as a kid. She‚Äôd painted the words¬†*‚ÄúFor My Hero‚Äù*¬†on the side in clumsy, childish handwriting.

Jack closed his eyes, weighing his options. The idea of disappointing Mia gnawed at him, but so did the thought of leaving something critical undone. ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù he said finally, his voice low. ‚ÄúBut this is it, Maddox. One last flight.‚Äù

Maddox exhaled audibly, the relief clear in his voice. ‚ÄúI knew I could count on you, Jack. Briefing‚Äôs at 0700. The bird‚Äôs already prepped. See you soon.‚Äù

Jack hung up without another word, the room suddenly too quiet. He sat there for a moment, staring at the phone in his hand, before tossing it onto the bed. ‚ÄúRoutine,‚Äù he muttered to himself. ‚ÄúSure it is.‚Äù

Jack stood, walking to the window. The first light of dawn was breaking over the quiet neighborhood. His eyes wandered to the garden, where Mia had planted sunflowers last spring. He could almost hear her voice when she found out he‚Äôd been called back‚Äîangry, worried, disappointed.

Mia was waiting in the kitchen when Jack came downstairs, still in his flight suit. The room was warm and inviting, the heart of their modest home. Morning light streamed through the window above the sink, casting a soft glow on the pale yellow walls adorned with framed photos of Mia‚Äôs childhood artwork and Karen‚Äôs favorite recipe cards. The kitchen table, a sturdy oak piece Jack had refinished years ago, was cluttered with Mia‚Äôs laptop, stacks of graded papers, and a half-empty coffee mug with the words¬†*World‚Äôs Best Teacher*¬†printed in bold blue letters.

The smell of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the faint scent of vanilla from a candle flickering on the windowsill. Mia sat cross-legged on one of the cushioned chairs, her auburn hair tied up in a loose bun, a few stubborn strands framing her freckled face. She wore a soft gray hoodie and faded jeans, the epitome of casual comfort. Her green eyes‚Äîso much like her mother‚Äôs‚Äînarrowed as they darted between her laptop screen and the papers scattered around her.

When Jack‚Äôs boots echoed on the hardwood floor, she looked up, her brow furrowing at the sight of him in his flight suit.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre up early,‚Äù she said, setting her mug down and crossing her arms over her chest. There was a slight edge to her voice, a mix of curiosity and concern. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs with the suit?‚Äù

Jack hesitated, his hand instinctively running through his graying hair. He glanced around the room, his eyes briefly landing on the family calendar hanging by the refrigerator, where tomorrow‚Äôs date was circled in red with the words¬†*Dad‚Äôs Retirement!*¬†written in Mia‚Äôs neat handwriting.

‚ÄúThey called me in,‚Äù he said, finally meeting her gaze. His voice was calm, but the faint guilt behind it was unmistakable. ‚ÄúJust a quick recon mission. I‚Äôll be back before you know it.‚Äù

Mia‚Äôs expression hardened. She pushed her laptop aside and leaned forward, her tone sharp with disbelief. ‚ÄúA mission? Dad, you promised. No more flying. You said yesterday was your last.‚Äù

Jack sighed, the weight of the situation pressing down on him. He took a seat across from her, the familiar creak of the old chair filling the silence. He looked at her‚Äîreally looked at her‚Äîseeing not just his daughter but the fierce, determined woman she had become. She had Karen‚Äôs resolve, that unyielding ability to stand her ground, and Jack couldn‚Äôt help but feel a pang of pride, even as he dreaded the argument brewing between them.

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù Jack said, his voice softening as he leaned toward Mia. ‚ÄúBut they need me for this one. It‚Äôs routine. Nothing dangerous.‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing dangerous,‚Äù Mia repeated, her tone dripping with doubt. She stood abruptly, her chair scraping against the floor. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve said that before, Dad. And every time, I‚Äôm the one sitting here wondering if you‚Äôre coming back. Do you know how many times I‚Äôve had to watch Mom pace by that window, waiting for a car to pull up with news that you were gone?‚Äù

Jack flinched. The mention of Karen struck like a dagger, but he kept his voice calm. ‚ÄúMia, this isn‚Äôt like those missions. It‚Äôs just recon. No combat, no risks. Just in and out.‚Äù

Mia shook her head, her hands gripping the back of the chair she‚Äôd just left. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know that! How can you? You‚Äôre always so sure, but things can change in an instant, and then‚Äî‚Äù She broke off, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúAnd then I‚Äôm the one who gets the call.‚Äù

Jack stepped closer, his hand reaching out to her shoulder. ‚ÄúMia, listen to me. I wouldn‚Äôt do this if it wasn‚Äôt important. They don‚Äôt have anyone else who knows that airspace like I do. It‚Äôs not something they‚Äôd ask if it wasn‚Äôt absolutely necessary.‚Äù

Mia pulled away, crossing her arms tightly over her chest. ‚ÄúAnd what about what‚Äôs necessary for us? For me? For your life here?‚Äù Her green eyes, so much like her mother‚Äôs, were filled with frustration and something deeper‚Äîfear. ‚ÄúTomorrow‚Äôs supposed to be your retirement. You promised this was over. That you‚Äôd be done putting yourself in danger.‚Äù

Jack sighed, his shoulders sagging under the weight of her words. ‚ÄúI¬†*am*¬†done, Mia. After this, it‚Äôs over. But I‚Äôve spent my life serving, and I can‚Äôt just turn my back on that in one day. This isn‚Äôt a choice I made lightly.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the problem, Dad,‚Äù she shot back, her voice rising. ‚ÄúYou always put the job first. Even now, when you finally have a chance to just be here, you‚Äôre still running off the second they call.‚Äù

Jack felt a flicker of frustration, but he pushed it down, knowing it wasn‚Äôt anger at her but at himself. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about putting the job first. It‚Äôs about protecting people‚Äîmaking sure others can live their lives without fear. You know that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve always done.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what about¬†*my*¬†fear?‚Äù Mia‚Äôs voice cracked. ‚ÄúWhat about my life without¬†*you*? Did you think about that?‚Äù

The words hung in the air, raw and heavy. Jack stared at her, guilt knotting in his chest. He wanted to argue, to explain, but he knew she was right. He‚Äôd spent so many years prioritizing the mission, the greater good, that he hadn‚Äôt stopped to see how it had shaped her.

‚ÄúMia,‚Äù he said quietly, his voice breaking, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I know it‚Äôs not fair to you. But I swear to you, this is the last time. I‚Äôll be back before the ceremony. I swear it.‚Äù

Mia turned away, wiping at her eyes. ‚ÄúYou better be,‚Äù she whispered, her voice barely audible. ‚ÄúBecause if you‚Äôre not, I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to keep doing this.‚Äù

Jack nodded, his heart aching, the weight of Mia‚Äôs words pressing on him like an invisible hand. He reached for his coffee on the counter, hesitating for a moment as if searching for the right words to bridge the silence between them. But nothing came. Instead, he turned toward the door, the quiet tension in the room lingering like an unspoken farewell.

As he reached for the handle, Mia‚Äôs voice stopped him. ‚ÄúDad.‚Äù

He turned, coffee in one hand, his other gripping the doorknob. Mia stood in the middle of the kitchen, her arms wrapped around herself as if bracing against an invisible chill. For a moment, she didn‚Äôt move, her lips pressed together in a tight line. Then, without a word, she stepped forward and wrapped her arms around him.

Jack froze, surprised by the sudden gesture. Her grip was firm, her cheek pressing against the rough fabric of his flight suit. Slowly, he set the coffee cup down on the counter and returned the embrace, his arms encircling her as he rested his chin lightly on her head. She smelled of coffee and lavender shampoo, a scent that took him back to quieter days when she was still a little girl, running to him with scraped knees and childhood worries he could easily fix.

But this wasn‚Äôt like those times. Her hug was different‚Äînot just a goodbye, but something heavier, almost desperate. Jack could feel it in the way her fingers gripped the back of his suit, as if holding on just a moment longer might somehow change what was coming.

‚ÄúYou come back,‚Äù she whispered, her voice trembling but determined. ‚ÄúNo excuses. No maybes. Just‚Ä¶ come back.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will,‚Äù Jack said softly, his voice catching. ‚ÄúI promise.‚Äù

But as he held her, a deep, unsettling feeling curled in his chest, one he hadn‚Äôt felt in years. It wasn‚Äôt fear‚Äînot exactly. It was something quieter, heavier, like the slow ticking of a clock counting down. He‚Äôd made countless promises to his family over the years, and he‚Äôd kept nearly all of them. Nearly.

Mia finally pulled back, her green eyes glossy but unyielding as they met his. She gave him a shaky smile, the kind that tried to be reassuring but only made the ache in his chest worse.

Jack reached out and brushed a strand of hair from her face. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back before you know it,‚Äù he said, trying to sound confident. But as he picked up his coffee and turned back to the door, the foreboding weight followed him like a shadow.

The crisp morning air hit him as he stepped outside, a sharp contrast to the warmth he‚Äôd just left behind. He paused on the porch, glancing back at the house one last time. Through the window, he could see Mia standing there, her arms crossed, her silhouette framed by the soft glow of the kitchen light. She was still watching him, her figure outlined against the familiarity of home.

For a fleeting moment, Jack thought about going back, about telling her the truth of what he felt. But instead, he gave her a small wave, forced a faint smile, and headed down the steps toward the car.

‚ÄúOne last time,‚Äù he murmured to himself, the words hollow in his ears. ‚ÄúJust one more.‚Äù

¬†

Jack found himself back in the cockpit of an F-35 Lightning II, its sleek form gleaming under the pale light of the early morning. The canopy glinted with the reflected hues of the rising sun, and as the ground crew gave him the thumbs-up, the familiar hiss and rumble of the engines starting up filled his ears. It was a sound he had grown to love‚Äîa symphony of power and precision that never failed to settle his nerves.

The jet taxied down the runway, the tires humming against the asphalt, before the roar of the engines crescendoed into a deafening howl. Jack was pushed back into his seat as the jet lifted smoothly into the air, breaking through the low-hanging clouds. The sky opened up before him, an endless expanse of blue that stretched into eternity. He adjusted his grip on the throttle, the cool metal reassuring under his gloved hand.

The HUD glowed a soft green against the backdrop of the brightening sky, a constant stream of data scrolling before his eyes. Altitude, speed, radar pings‚Äîeverything was as it should be. It was like slipping into an old skin, every control and display as familiar as the lines on his palms.

‚ÄúViper One, you are clear for recon. Maintain radio contact,‚Äù came the crisp voice of the mission operator in his earpiece. The static crackle that followed was a sound he hadn‚Äôt realized he‚Äôd missed.

Jack pressed the comms button on his control stick. ‚ÄúCopy that. Viper One en route,‚Äù he replied, his voice steady.

The operator chuckled lightly, a hint of admiration in his tone. ‚ÄúGood to hear you up there again, Colonel. It‚Äôs been a while.‚Äù

Jack smirked, his eyes scanning the horizon. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get used to it, Control. After this, I‚Äôm handing over the keys for good.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood, sir. But if I may say, it‚Äôs an honor having you back. There‚Äôs no one better for this kind of run.‚Äù

Jack exhaled, a mix of pride and weariness in his breath. ‚ÄúFlattery‚Äôs not going to get me to stick around, Control. Let‚Äôs keep it professional.‚Äù

‚ÄúRoger that, Viper One. Your flight path is clear for now, but radar shows a little chop about fifty miles out. Stay sharp.‚Äù

‚ÄúCopy. Thanks for the heads-up,‚Äù Jack replied, adjusting his course slightly as the jet climbed higher, the engines thrumming beneath him. The vast expanse of ocean glimmered below, sunlight catching the rippling waves and creating a dazzling patchwork of silver and blue.

The jet‚Äôs sensors beeped softly, a rhythmic reassurance that everything was running smoothly‚Äîfor now. The familiar sights and sounds enveloped him, but Jack couldn‚Äôt shake the faint shadow of foreboding that had followed him since he left the house. He flexed his fingers on the stick, the leather of his gloves creaking slightly.

‚ÄúControl, you‚Äôve got my six, right? No surprises?‚Äù he asked, his tone casual but edged with something unreadable.

‚ÄúAlways, Viper One,‚Äù the operator replied confidently. ‚ÄúYou focus on the recon. We‚Äôll keep an eye on everything else.‚Äù

Jack nodded to himself, the horizon stretching endlessly ahead. The hum of the engines and the operator‚Äôs voice were his only companions as the mission began in earnest. The routine nature of the task did little to quell the uneasy feeling in his gut, but for now, he focused on the rhythm of the flight, the beauty of the sky, and the familiar dance between man and machine.

The flight was uneventful at first. The Arctic expanse stretched below Jack like a vast, frozen canvas, its white surface fractured by dark ribbons of open water. The barren beauty was hypnotic, the kind of quiet vastness that could make a man feel small. The hum of his engines and the steady beeping of the radar were the only sounds in his world.

As he neared the designated coordinates, his radar emitted a sharp ping, breaking the monotony. Jack‚Äôs eyes flicked to the HUD, his brow furrowing. A contact had appeared‚Äîsomething massive. The object wasn‚Äôt behaving like anything he was used to. It didn‚Äôt have a transponder signal, its radar signature wasn‚Äôt consistent with known aircraft, and it was moving at an astonishing speed, cutting across the radar screen like a ghost.

‚ÄúControl, I‚Äôve got an unidentified object on radar,‚Äù Jack said, his voice steady but edged with curiosity. ‚ÄúNo transponder. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs huge. Sending you telemetry now.‚Äù

There was a pause on the other end, and Jack could hear faint chatter in the background as the mission operator relayed his report. The AWACS plane orbiting miles behind him chimed in, its radar picking up the same anomaly.

‚ÄúViper One, this is AWACS Alpha. We‚Äôre seeing it too. Signature is massive, but it‚Äôs not matching any known profiles. Hang tight, we‚Äôre cross-referencing now.‚Äù

Jack tightened his grip on the controls, his eyes scanning the empty expanse ahead. ‚ÄúHang tight? This thing‚Äôs moving at Mach speeds, and you don‚Äôt know what it is?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working on it,‚Äù the mission operator said, his voice strained. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not on any civilian or military registries. No heat signature, no transponder, nothing. Just a damn big blip on the radar.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù Jack muttered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm sitting out here alone or anything.‚Äù

Before he could say more, his jet suddenly jolted, the turbulence rattling through the airframe. Jack cursed under his breath, steadying the controls as the instruments flickered briefly.

‚ÄúControl, I just hit some serious chop out here. What the hell was that?‚Äù

‚ÄúStand by, Viper One,‚Äù the operator replied. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not showing any weather disturbances in your area.‚Äù

Jack‚Äôs eyes shot forward just as the massive object burst through the clouds ahead of him, its sleek, unmarked surface reflecting the weak sunlight like polished obsidian. It was enormous‚Äîeasily three times the size of his F-35‚Äîwith an otherworldly design that defied conventional aerodynamics. There were no markings, no visible engines, no windows. Just a seamless, predatory shape moving with impossible precision.

His breath caught in his throat. ‚ÄúControl,‚Äù he said, his voice quieter now, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a visual. It‚Äôs not one of ours.‚Äù

‚ÄúViper One, repeat,‚Äù came the operator‚Äôs response, urgency lacing his words.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not ours,‚Äù Jack repeated firmly. ‚ÄúAnd if it is, somebody forgot to send me the memo.‚Äù

The AWACS chimed in again, their voices growing more frantic. ‚ÄúStill no ID on the object. Its radar profile keeps shifting. We‚Äôve never seen anything like this.‚Äù

Jack‚Äôs jet was rocked again, this time by the object‚Äôs wake as it streaked past him with uncanny speed, vanishing back into the clouds as quickly as it had appeared. His heart pounded as he tried to process what he‚Äôd just seen.

‚ÄúControl,‚Äù he said, his voice low but steady. ‚ÄúYou better figure out what the hell that thing is, and fast. Because whatever it is, it‚Äôs not playing by the rules.‚Äù

Jack‚Äôs blood ran cold as the massive, unmarked craft slipped effortlessly through the skies ahead of him, its sleek form almost mocking his attempts to keep pace. He shoved the throttle forward, the roar of his F-35‚Äôs afterburner splitting the frigid air like a thunderclap. Flames erupted from the jet‚Äôs twin engines, propelling him forward with a force that pressed him into his seat.

‚ÄúControl, I‚Äôm in pursuit,‚Äù he called out, his voice tense. ‚ÄúTarget is maintaining altitude at 45,000 feet. No response to identification requests.‚Äù

The aircraft loomed ahead, eerily steady, its lack of visible propulsion systems unnerving. Jack‚Äôs heart pounded as he followed its unpredictable maneuvers, weaving through the Arctic skies. Each time he thought he‚Äôd closed the gap, the craft seemed to slip just beyond his reach, as if it were toying with him.

Suddenly, the object slowed, breaking its steady pace with an abruptness that forced Jack to react. He jerked the stick, narrowly avoiding its wake. His HUD lit up with warning signs as turbulence battered his jet. Then, as if sensing his presence, the massive craft opened a set of hidden payload doors beneath its belly.

‚ÄúControl, I‚Äôve got movement!‚Äù Jack barked. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs deploying‚Ä¶ something.‚Äù

The sight hit him like a gut punch. Inside the payload bay, he caught a brief but unmistakable glimpse: a cylindrical device, sleek and metallic, unmistakably a warhead.

‚ÄúControl, this is not a drill!‚Äù he shouted, adrenaline surging through his veins. ‚ÄúThe target is armed. Repeat, armed and hostile!‚Äù

The line crackled as General Maddox‚Äôs voice came through, sharp and unyielding. ‚ÄúHawkeye, you are weapons free. You have authorization to engage.‚Äù",2,1731984994.0,stories,1,1.0,False
1gun8oj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1gun8oj/the_perfect_wife/,The Perfect Wife,"Before you dive into this tale, know that my whispers reach beyond the page. All of my stories- woven in shadows and whispered for the sleepless- await you on YouTube. There, I guide you through the darkest dreams and deepest fears, one story at a time. Seek me out as Mr. Sandman and let the darkness speak to you. Let's begin.

Laura Grayson was the kind of woman everyone admired. In her small town, she seemed to have it all: a beautiful home, two adorable children, and a charming, successful husband named Darren. She was the mother who always volunteered for bake sales, who showed up at PTA meetings with fresh coffee for everyone, and who had an endless supply of warm smiles and gracious conversation. But the truth was, Laura was trapped.

For years, her life had been an unending cycle of control and criticism from Darren, who was respected around town as a charismatic businessman. Behind closed doors, he was cold, calculating, and methodically cruel. He controlled the family‚Äôs money, monitoring every purchase she made. He criticized her every move, calling her lazy and incompetent. Her friends had stopped calling, and Darren made sure she knew it was because she wasn‚Äôt worth anyone‚Äôs time. Isolation became her reality, and she buried her pain beneath the facade of perfection.

Then one evening, Laura noticed a strange charge on their credit card statement‚Äîa luxury hotel stay on a weekend when Darren had been ‚Äúout of town for business.‚Äù Her heart raced as she thought back to that weekend and realized he‚Äôd never called, never checked in on her or the kids. Suspicion gnawed at her, and she waited until he was asleep, then quietly took his phone from the nightstand and unlocked it, hands trembling.

The messages she found confirmed her darkest fears. Darren had been having an affair with April, her closest friend. The two of them had been sneaking around for months, exchanging messages about the thrill of secrecy, mocking her, even sharing intimate details of her life and her insecurities. Laura felt the ground fall out from under her. She had been humiliated, used, and dismissed by the people she trusted most.

The next day, Laura confronted Darren, her voice barely containing the anger boiling inside her. But Darren didn‚Äôt flinch. He simply shrugged, looked her straight in the eye, and told her that he was done pretending. He blamed her for the affair, said she was pathetic, a failure of a wife. As he turned his back on her and went upstairs, Laura felt something inside her snap.

In the days that followed, Laura‚Äôs mind became a whirlwind of rage and dark thoughts. She had given everything to this man‚Äîher love, her loyalty, her very identity‚Äîand he had taken it all without a second thought. At first, she only thought of confronting April, to demand an explanation and maybe some sign of regret. But each night she stayed awake, staring at the ceiling, imagining their faces, the betrayal in their eyes, her anger grew sharper.

One cold November evening, after Darren had gone to bed, Laura went down to the basement, where Darren had stashed his old tools. She found a rusted hammer, heavy and solid, and felt its weight in her hand. She wasn‚Äôt sure if she had the nerve to go through with what she was thinking. But every time she pictured Darren‚Äôs dismissive face and April‚Äôs mocking texts, her resolve hardened.

Just after midnight, Laura slipped out of the house, hammer in hand, and drove the few blocks to April‚Äôs. She rehearsed what she would say, imagining April‚Äôs shock, her panic. When she reached April‚Äôs door, she tried to calm herself, wiping the sweat from her brow, steadying her breathing. When April opened the door, she looked surprised but quickly smiled, assuming Laura was stopping by for a friendly chat. Laura forced a smile back and whispered, ‚ÄúCan I come in? I just need to talk.‚Äù

Once inside, Laura dropped the friendly pretense. Her voice grew cold, and her expression twisted with anger. ‚ÄúHow could you?‚Äù she asked, venom dripping from every word. ‚ÄúI trusted you. I thought you were my friend.‚Äù

April‚Äôs face paled, and she stammered, trying to explain herself, but Laura didn‚Äôt want to hear it. Her grip tightened around the hammer, and in a moment of blind rage, she swung it, feeling the impact reverberate through her arm. The room was filled with April‚Äôs screams, but Laura‚Äôs fury had numbed her to everything else.

By the time the night was over, Laura was exhausted, physically and mentally. She left April‚Äôs house in a daze, covered in blood and without a plan. She hadn‚Äôt thought beyond this moment, and now the consequences loomed over her like a shadow.

The next morning, Darren reported her missing, claiming he had no idea where his wife was. He played the concerned husband, even giving teary interviews to the local news. But as the investigation unfolded, detectives began to notice small inconsistencies in Darren‚Äôs story. And when they found April‚Äôs body, it didn‚Äôt take long for them to find Laura‚Äôs fingerprints on the weapon.

When they finally tracked Laura down, she was hiding in an abandoned cabin just outside town, her mind shattered and her body gaunt from days without sleep. She didn‚Äôt fight when they put her in handcuffs. The woman the world had known as the perfect wife and mother was gone, replaced by a hollow shell.

As the trial began, people flocked to the courtroom, unable to believe that Laura Grayson, the beloved face of their community, had committed such a brutal act. But as the details of Darren‚Äôs infidelity and abuse came to light, sympathy grew for Laura. Some people even saw her as a victim, a woman who had been driven to her breaking point. Others thought she was just as cold and calculating murderer!

In the end, Laura‚Äôs sentence would be life in prison. Her children, left without a mother and in the quiet town where Laura had once been a beacon of grace and goodness, her story became a cautionary tale‚Äîa dark reminder of what can happen when a person, even someone you think you know, is pushed too far.",1,1731984961.0,Horror_stories,0,1.0,False
1gun8dg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/1gun8dg/tomorrow_is_my_last_session_with_my_therapist/,Tomorrow is my last session with my therapist.,"Tomorrow is my last session with my therapist of two and a half years. I've grown quite fond of her, developing feelings of attachment and transference. She has been with me through hospitalizations and the like. I wouldn't be where I am today, feeling proud of my success, were it not for her dedication and compassion.

However, along with the feeling of sadness is the feeling of resentment, rejection, and abandonment. I feel that it was too easy for her to let me go once I mentioned that I felt it was no longer healthy for me to continue the relationship. 

I decided to part ways due to the fact that I was unable to be completely honest with her, fearing what she would think of me. I was also engaging in behavior that involves her that I find shameful and despicable, and I was having ideas and plans that would lead me deeper and deeper in the rabbit hole of repulsiveness.

In our next session, we exchanged words that bordered on argument. I was making a case of staying with her, that I felt that working with someone else would be avoiding tackling the issue head on. That working through the issues with her would be awkward and difficult, but the work would help confront awkward situations in different scenarios. 

As someone with BPD, I feel like my life has been a constant string of running away from relationships. Hell, I even decided to uproot my life and migrate to a different country, all because I fell out with close friends back home. And having fears of abandonment, I was hoping the person who has stuck with me and seen the worst of me would be willing to continue working with me.

I asked her directly if she would find it uncomfortable to talk about it. She didn't answer my question and she said that our difference in gender would prove to be a far too great of a barrier to be talking openly. I was disappointed to say the least. I thought I was working with someone who probably has encountered this situation before and would be adept in handling it, having worked in this field for over 25 years. 

I immediately associated this rejection to a recent situation I had disclosed to her. I had mentioned that I was flirting with my boss at my job, and I was being flirtatiously touchy with her while at work. I had talked about how I found myself falling in love with my boss, despite her being married, having children the same age as me, and being my boss. 

My fear of being completely honest at the expense of my therapist's perception of me proved to be true. I felt that ever since I talked about my work situation, her perception of me had changed. Perhaps she did feel safe with me anymore. Perhaps if I hadn't shown how awful I truly was, she would have been willing to work with me.

Though perhaps my perception of her to letting me go easily is her professional way of parting ways with clients. Perhaps this almost ruthless professionalism is her way of not letting feelings affect her actions and words. And I truly respect that professionalism of not allowing emotions get in the way, especially in this type of relationship.

But I wish she would show at least a tiny bit of humanity. I refuse to believe that someone who has crossed certain boundaries with me would find it this easy. Someone who when they worked from home, called me from what I supposed to be her personal phone due to the private caller ID. Someone who has disclosed to me private things in her life, like when she was about to go on medical leave and she told none of her clients but me, and about how she had called of work around the time of this disclosure due to her anxiety, and that I shouldn't tell anyone about it. Someone who suggested that we go out for coffee for a session. That when I expressed fears that I wouldn't feel comfortable talking about private things in such a public place, she suggested we talk in her car. In. Her. Car. 

Deep down I know it is unfair on her for me to be resentful. Her actions may have crossed boundaries, but I believe it was coming from a someone who genuinely wanted to help through connection. Unfortunately for me, it's not in the same sphere of connection that I wanted us to have. 

It's also unfair on her since I've been quite distant for some time. I confessed that I had lied about being called into work to miss our session when in truth I just wanted to avoid her. It might have been a relief for her that I finally expressed my unhappiness, and she had been expecting it for a while. I even mentioned long ago how there are certain things I'm not comfortable talking to her since she isn't a guy. She also suggested the therapist I could switch to, someone in the facility I knew and was familiar with. 

I just wish she would have fought more for her to remain as my therapist. But that is not the nature of this relationship. She does not owe me anything and she isn't obligated to continue to work with me if she's uncomfortable.

I know that there is a barrier with this kind of relationship that cannot be crossed. But a part of me wants to throw caution in the wind and just do what I've been wanting to do for the longest time, even at the risk of devastating rejection and losing a resource of support altogether. 

I've thought about writing a letter to express my gratitude, but also include these thoughts of resentment. I want to make her aware that this is how I feel. I don't think it's a good idea leaving things on a bitter note, however I'm not at a place where I can see the beautiful journey of our time together as it's still dimmed by the cloud of grief.",1,1731984936.0,TalkTherapy,1,1.0,False

1gun6go,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miscarriage/comments/1gun6go/just_came_home_from_the_ed/,Just came home from the ED.,"Hi friends, today I was supposed to be 5Ws, 14DPO. I got my BFP Friday morning, 3 digitals yes (2FRER and 1 CB) along with the standard FRER line. 

I‚Äôve had a chemical before, so I was kinda habitually testing for line progression using my pregmate strips. Surely enough, Saturday and Sunday I started getting full aches‚Äî lines are faint but still there. Although my abdomen was aching‚Äî it didn‚Äôt last long. It would come and go. First sign of spotting Saturday with a very LIGHT yellow/brown wipe. Only when I wipe. Then Sunday, the spotting seemed to be darker but not coffee bean dark, just a light caramel color. But something felt wrong. Again only when I wipe and pregmate strips were faint.


This morning woke up to do my first urine, and it was just bl**dy. Dark red. I freaked out. Cramping was intense. Called OB to try to get seen, they said to go to the ED. In the ED for what seemed forever.

Blood HCG drawn, undetected.
Urine, undetected.
Ultra sounds (abdominal and trans vaginal), undetected but I have a cyst on my right ovary.

Thank goodness it wasn‚Äôt an ectopic.

I‚Äôm just confused. How did I go from BFPs with multiple digitals not even three days ago‚Ä¶ to FN.

This would be our second chemical. 

I‚Äôm devastated. In denial, even‚Ä¶ 

I just don‚Äôt understand how my HCG is undetected. I took two in the morning and then again two in the afternoon that day. 

It just irritated me when the providers said ‚Äúmaybe it was a false positive.‚Äù Then I mentioned how it was different brands and DIGITAL. Which then they started talking about chemicals‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

1gun5mc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SirBigdog01/comments/1gun5mc/story_the_final_sortie_part_1/,Story: The Final Sortie - Part 1,"Colonel Jack ‚ÄúHawkeye‚Äù Harris stared at the photo on his desk, a cherished relic of his early days. The photo, dog-eared and slightly faded, showed him in his first fighter jet, grinning like a schoolboy, his helmet tucked under one arm, and the sun glinting off the metal fuselage behind him. His desk was nestled in the corner of his modest but warm living room, a place that carried the weight of a life well-lived. The wood-paneled walls bore marks of time, lined with shelves filled with books on aviation, framed medals, and photos of Jack with his squadron, each image telling a story of camaraderie and sacrifice.

Beyond the wide bay window, the late afternoon sun bathed the quiet cul-de-sac in a golden glow. Jack‚Äôs small suburban home sat at the end of the street, its neatly trimmed lawn bordered by rose bushes his late wife, Karen, had planted years ago. The faint hum of a neighbor‚Äôs lawnmower drifted through the air, mingling with the distant laughter of children riding their bikes.

Jack turned his gaze to the mantel above the brick fireplace, where a carefully arranged collection of family photos resided. His eyes lingered on one picture in particular‚Äîa snapshot of Mia, his daughter, taken during her college graduation. She had Karen‚Äôs smile and Jack‚Äôs piercing blue eyes, a combination that always caught him off guard. Now a teacher, Mia had moved back home temporarily to help her dad ease into civilian life, though Jack suspected she was more worried about his adjustment than he let on.

Tomorrow, he‚Äôd hang up his flight suit for good. The thought felt surreal, like stepping into a world that moved slower and quieter than the one he‚Äôd known. Retirement was waiting, and so was Mia, who‚Äôd been counting down the days with a mix of excitement and nervousness. Jack sighed, his fingers brushing the edge of the photo on his desk. He had spent so much of his life in the skies; the idea of being grounded still felt foreign. But this house, this family‚Äîthis was his new mission.

¬†The call came at 5:00 AM, just hours before the planned retirement ceremony. The shrill, insistent buzz of his phone shattered the stillness of the early morning, pulling Jack out of a restless sleep. He sat up abruptly, the weight of thirty years in the cockpit reflected in the stiffness of his back and shoulders. The room was dim, the faint glow of streetlights filtering through the blinds casting long shadows across the walls. His nightstand was cluttered with remnants of his life on the edge of two worlds: a dog-eared flight manual, a half-empty glass of water, and a framed photo of him and Mia from her high school graduation.

Groaning, Jack rubbed the grit from his eyes, his mind struggling to bridge the gap between sleep and the reality of the call. His hand fumbled across the nightstand before landing on the vibrating phone. The screen's harsh light pierced the darkness, and his squinting eyes focused on the single word displayed on the caller ID: **COMMAND**.

The sight of it sent a flicker of unease through him. It had been months since a call from command interrupted his private life, and he had hoped those days were behind him. The looming ceremony, the culmination of his long career, was supposed to mark the end of these early-morning summonses. For a moment, he debated letting it ring, but old habits died hard. With a resigned sigh, he swiped to answer, his voice gravelly from sleep.

‚ÄúHarris,‚Äù he said, his tone a mix of professionalism and irritation, knowing that whatever awaited on the other end of the line wasn‚Äôt going to make the morning any easier.

‚ÄúColonel Harris, this is General Maddox,‚Äù came the voice on the other end of the line, calm but tinged with urgency.

Jack frowned, rubbing his face as he tried to shake off the remnants of sleep. He swung his legs over the edge of the bed and glanced at the faintly glowing clock on his nightstand. Five o‚Äôclock. Typical. ‚ÄúMorning, General,‚Äù Jack said, his voice flat. ‚ÄúWhat can I do for you that couldn‚Äôt wait until sunrise?‚Äù

Maddox chuckled lightly, though it lacked his usual warmth. ‚ÄúStill as sharp as ever, I see. How‚Äôs civilian life treating you, Jack? Or is it too soon to ask?‚Äù

‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt know yet,‚Äù Jack replied dryly. ‚ÄúStill officially on the clock for another twenty-four hours. Thought I might get to enjoy a peaceful morning for once, but here we are.‚Äù

There was a pause, the kind that told Jack this wasn‚Äôt a social call. Maddox cleared his throat. ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôll have plenty of peaceful mornings soon enough. Look, I wouldn‚Äôt call if it wasn‚Äôt important.‚Äù

Jack leaned forward, his elbows resting on his knees. ‚ÄúGeneral, with all due respect, I‚Äôm out. This is someone else‚Äôs turn. I‚Äôve earned my time off.‚Äù

Maddox sighed, his tone shifting, becoming uncharacteristically somber. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt optional, Jack. It‚Äôs routine‚Äîjust recon. Nothing dangerous. But you‚Äôre the only one who knows this airspace like the back of your hand. We‚Äôve got something unusual out near the Alaskan coast, and the drones aren‚Äôt giving us the clarity we need. It‚Äôll be in and out, quick and clean.‚Äù

Jack ran a hand through his graying hair, his shoulders sagging. ‚ÄúGeneral, I‚Äôve spent the last thirty years putting my life on the line. Can‚Äôt someone else handle this? I‚Äôve got a ceremony tomorrow, and my daughter‚Äôs been planning it for weeks. You know how she gets.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù Maddox said, his voice softening slightly. ‚ÄúMia‚Äôs a good kid. Karen would be proud of her. And believe me, I wouldn‚Äôt be calling you if I had another option. But we‚Äôre stretched thin right now‚Äîhalf the squadron‚Äôs deployed, and the rest aren‚Äôt trained for these conditions. You‚Äôre the best man for the job, Jack. Hell, you wrote the book on this kind of mission.‚Äù

Jack‚Äôs jaw tightened. He didn‚Äôt like being called the ‚Äúbest man‚Äù anymore; it felt like a polite way of saying ‚Äúindispensable enough to keep dragging into the fire.‚Äù He let out a long breath, staring at the darkened window across the room. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me you‚Äôve got no one else?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one I trust,‚Äù Maddox admitted. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a combat op. It‚Äôs routine. You‚Äôll be home in time to put on your dress blues and make Mia proud.‚Äù

Jack was silent for a long moment. His eyes settled on a model of his old F-16 that Mia had built for him as a kid. She‚Äôd painted the words *‚ÄúFor My Hero‚Äù* on the side in clumsy, childish handwriting.

Jack closed his eyes, weighing his options. The idea of disappointing Mia gnawed at him, but so did the thought of leaving something critical undone. ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù he said finally, his voice low. ‚ÄúBut this is it, Maddox. One last flight.‚Äù

Maddox exhaled audibly, the relief clear in his voice. ‚ÄúI knew I could count on you, Jack. Briefing‚Äôs at 0700. The bird‚Äôs already prepped. See you soon.‚Äù

Jack hung up without another word, the room suddenly too quiet. He sat there for a moment, staring at the phone in his hand, before tossing it onto the bed. ‚ÄúRoutine,‚Äù he muttered to himself. ‚ÄúSure it is.‚Äù

Jack stood, walking to the window. The first light of dawn was breaking over the quiet neighborhood. His eyes wandered to the garden, where Mia had planted sunflowers last spring. He could almost hear her voice when she found out he‚Äôd been called back‚Äîangry, worried, disappointed.

Mia was waiting in the kitchen when Jack came downstairs, still in his flight suit. The room was warm and inviting, the heart of their modest home. Morning light streamed through the window above the sink, casting a soft glow on the pale yellow walls adorned with framed photos of Mia‚Äôs childhood artwork and Karen‚Äôs favorite recipe cards. The kitchen table, a sturdy oak piece Jack had refinished years ago, was cluttered with Mia‚Äôs laptop, stacks of graded papers, and a half-empty coffee mug with the words *World‚Äôs Best Teacher* printed in bold blue letters.

The smell of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the faint scent of vanilla from a candle flickering on the windowsill. Mia sat cross-legged on one of the cushioned chairs, her auburn hair tied up in a loose bun, a few stubborn strands framing her freckled face. She wore a soft gray hoodie and faded jeans, the epitome of casual comfort. Her green eyes‚Äîso much like her mother‚Äôs‚Äînarrowed as they darted between her laptop screen and the papers scattered around her.

When Jack‚Äôs boots echoed on the hardwood floor, she looked up, her brow furrowing at the sight of him in his flight suit.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre up early,‚Äù she said, setting her mug down and crossing her arms over her chest. There was a slight edge to her voice, a mix of curiosity and concern. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs with the suit?‚Äù

Jack hesitated, his hand instinctively running through his graying hair. He glanced around the room, his eyes briefly landing on the family calendar hanging by the refrigerator, where tomorrow‚Äôs date was circled in red with the words *Dad‚Äôs Retirement!* written in Mia‚Äôs neat handwriting.

‚ÄúThey called me in,‚Äù he said, finally meeting her gaze. His voice was calm, but the faint guilt behind it was unmistakable. ‚ÄúJust a quick recon mission. I‚Äôll be back before you know it.‚Äù

Mia‚Äôs expression hardened. She pushed her laptop aside and leaned forward, her tone sharp with disbelief. ‚ÄúA mission? Dad, you promised. No more flying. You said yesterday was your last.‚Äù

Jack sighed, the weight of the situation pressing down on him. He took a seat across from her, the familiar creak of the old chair filling the silence. He looked at her‚Äîreally looked at her‚Äîseeing not just his daughter but the fierce, determined woman she had become. She had Karen‚Äôs resolve, that unyielding ability to stand her ground, and Jack couldn‚Äôt help but feel a pang of pride, even as he dreaded the argument brewing between them.

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù Jack said, his voice softening as he leaned toward Mia. ‚ÄúBut they need me for this one. It‚Äôs routine. Nothing dangerous.‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing dangerous,‚Äù Mia repeated, her tone dripping with doubt. She stood abruptly, her chair scraping against the floor. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve said that before, Dad. And every time, I‚Äôm the one sitting here wondering if you‚Äôre coming back. Do you know how many times I‚Äôve had to watch Mom pace by that window, waiting for a car to pull up with news that you were gone?‚Äù

Jack flinched. The mention of Karen struck like a dagger, but he kept his voice calm. ‚ÄúMia, this isn‚Äôt like those missions. It‚Äôs just recon. No combat, no risks. Just in and out.‚Äù

Mia shook her head, her hands gripping the back of the chair she‚Äôd just left. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know that! How can you? You‚Äôre always so sure, but things can change in an instant, and then‚Äî‚Äù She broke off, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúAnd then I‚Äôm the one who gets the call.‚Äù

Jack stepped closer, his hand reaching out to her shoulder. ‚ÄúMia, listen to me. I wouldn‚Äôt do this if it wasn‚Äôt important. They don‚Äôt have anyone else who knows that airspace like I do. It‚Äôs not something they‚Äôd ask if it wasn‚Äôt absolutely necessary.‚Äù

Mia pulled away, crossing her arms tightly over her chest. ‚ÄúAnd what about what‚Äôs necessary for us? For me? For your life here?‚Äù Her green eyes, so much like her mother‚Äôs, were filled with frustration and something deeper‚Äîfear. ‚ÄúTomorrow‚Äôs supposed to be your retirement. You promised this was over. That you‚Äôd be done putting yourself in danger.‚Äù

Jack sighed, his shoulders sagging under the weight of her words. ‚ÄúI *am* done, Mia. After this, it‚Äôs over. But I‚Äôve spent my life serving, and I can‚Äôt just turn my back on that in one day. This isn‚Äôt a choice I made lightly.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the problem, Dad,‚Äù she shot back, her voice rising. ‚ÄúYou always put the job first. Even now, when you finally have a chance to just be here, you‚Äôre still running off the second they call.‚Äù

Jack felt a flicker of frustration, but he pushed it down, knowing it wasn‚Äôt anger at her but at himself. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about putting the job first. It‚Äôs about protecting people‚Äîmaking sure others can live their lives without fear. You know that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve always done.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what about *my* fear?‚Äù Mia‚Äôs voice cracked. ‚ÄúWhat about my life without *you*? Did you think about that?‚Äù

The words hung in the air, raw and heavy. Jack stared at her, guilt knotting in his chest. He wanted to argue, to explain, but he knew she was right. He‚Äôd spent so many years prioritizing the mission, the greater good, that he hadn‚Äôt stopped to see how it had shaped her.

‚ÄúMia,‚Äù he said quietly, his voice breaking, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I know it‚Äôs not fair to you. But I swear to you, this is the last time. I‚Äôll be back before the ceremony. I swear it.‚Äù

Mia turned away, wiping at her eyes. ‚ÄúYou better be,‚Äù she whispered, her voice barely audible. ‚ÄúBecause if you‚Äôre not, I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to keep doing this.‚Äù

Jack nodded, his heart aching, the weight of Mia‚Äôs words pressing on him like an invisible hand. He reached for his coffee on the counter, hesitating for a moment as if searching for the right words to bridge the silence between them. But nothing came. Instead, he turned toward the door, the quiet tension in the room lingering like an unspoken farewell.

As he reached for the handle, Mia‚Äôs voice stopped him. ‚ÄúDad.‚Äù

He turned, coffee in one hand, his other gripping the doorknob. Mia stood in the middle of the kitchen, her arms wrapped around herself as if bracing against an invisible chill. For a moment, she didn‚Äôt move, her lips pressed together in a tight line. Then, without a word, she stepped forward and wrapped her arms around him.

Jack froze, surprised by the sudden gesture. Her grip was firm, her cheek pressing against the rough fabric of his flight suit. Slowly, he set the coffee cup down on the counter and returned the embrace, his arms encircling her as he rested his chin lightly on her head. She smelled of coffee and lavender shampoo, a scent that took him back to quieter days when she was still a little girl, running to him with scraped knees and childhood worries he could easily fix.

But this wasn‚Äôt like those times. Her hug was different‚Äînot just a goodbye, but something heavier, almost desperate. Jack could feel it in the way her fingers gripped the back of his suit, as if holding on just a moment longer might somehow change what was coming.

‚ÄúYou come back,‚Äù she whispered, her voice trembling but determined. ‚ÄúNo excuses. No maybes. Just‚Ä¶ come back.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will,‚Äù Jack said softly, his voice catching. ‚ÄúI promise.‚Äù

But as he held her, a deep, unsettling feeling curled in his chest, one he hadn‚Äôt felt in years. It wasn‚Äôt fear‚Äînot exactly. It was something quieter, heavier, like the slow ticking of a clock counting down. He‚Äôd made countless promises to his family over the years, and he‚Äôd kept nearly all of them. Nearly.

Mia finally pulled back, her green eyes glossy but unyielding as they met his. She gave him a shaky smile, the kind that tried to be reassuring but only made the ache in his chest worse.

Jack reached out and brushed a strand of hair from her face. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back before you know it,‚Äù he said, trying to sound confident. But as he picked up his coffee and turned back to the door, the foreboding weight followed him like a shadow.

The crisp morning air hit him as he stepped outside, a sharp contrast to the warmth he‚Äôd just left behind. He paused on the porch, glancing back at the house one last time. Through the window, he could see Mia standing there, her arms crossed, her silhouette framed by the soft glow of the kitchen light. She was still watching him, her figure outlined against the familiarity of home.

For a fleeting moment, Jack thought about going back, about telling her the truth of what he felt. But instead, he gave her a small wave, forced a faint smile, and headed down the steps toward the car.

‚ÄúOne last time,‚Äù he murmured to himself, the words hollow in his ears. ‚ÄúJust one more.‚Äù

¬†

Jack found himself back in the cockpit of an F-35 Lightning II, its sleek form gleaming under the pale light of the early morning. The canopy glinted with the reflected hues of the rising sun, and as the ground crew gave him the thumbs-up, the familiar hiss and rumble of the engines starting up filled his ears. It was a sound he had grown to love‚Äîa symphony of power and precision that never failed to settle his nerves.

The jet taxied down the runway, the tires humming against the asphalt, before the roar of the engines crescendoed into a deafening howl. Jack was pushed back into his seat as the jet lifted smoothly into the air, breaking through the low-hanging clouds. The sky opened up before him, an endless expanse of blue that stretched into eternity. He adjusted his grip on the throttle, the cool metal reassuring under his gloved hand.

The HUD glowed a soft green against the backdrop of the brightening sky, a constant stream of data scrolling before his eyes. Altitude, speed, radar pings‚Äîeverything was as it should be. It was like slipping into an old skin, every control and display as familiar as the lines on his palms.

‚ÄúViper One, you are clear for recon. Maintain radio contact,‚Äù came the crisp voice of the mission operator in his earpiece. The static crackle that followed was a sound he hadn‚Äôt realized he‚Äôd missed.

Jack pressed the comms button on his control stick. ‚ÄúCopy that. Viper One en route,‚Äù he replied, his voice steady.

The operator chuckled lightly, a hint of admiration in his tone. ‚ÄúGood to hear you up there again, Colonel. It‚Äôs been a while.‚Äù

Jack smirked, his eyes scanning the horizon. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get used to it, Control. After this, I‚Äôm handing over the keys for good.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood, sir. But if I may say, it‚Äôs an honor having you back. There‚Äôs no one better for this kind of run.‚Äù

Jack exhaled, a mix of pride and weariness in his breath. ‚ÄúFlattery‚Äôs not going to get me to stick around, Control. Let‚Äôs keep it professional.‚Äù

‚ÄúRoger that, Viper One. Your flight path is clear for now, but radar shows a little chop about fifty miles out. Stay sharp.‚Äù

‚ÄúCopy. Thanks for the heads-up,‚Äù Jack replied, adjusting his course slightly as the jet climbed higher, the engines thrumming beneath him. The vast expanse of ocean glimmered below, sunlight catching the rippling waves and creating a dazzling patchwork of silver and blue.

The jet‚Äôs sensors beeped softly, a rhythmic reassurance that everything was running smoothly‚Äîfor now. The familiar sights and sounds enveloped him, but Jack couldn‚Äôt shake the faint shadow of foreboding that had followed him since he left the house. He flexed his fingers on the stick, the leather of his gloves creaking slightly.

‚ÄúControl, you‚Äôve got my six, right? No surprises?‚Äù he asked, his tone casual but edged with something unreadable.

‚ÄúAlways, Viper One,‚Äù the operator replied confidently. ‚ÄúYou focus on the recon. We‚Äôll keep an eye on everything else.‚Äù

Jack nodded to himself, the horizon stretching endlessly ahead. The hum of the engines and the operator‚Äôs voice were his only companions as the mission began in earnest. The routine nature of the task did little to quell the uneasy feeling in his gut, but for now, he focused on the rhythm of the flight, the beauty of the sky, and the familiar dance between man and machine.

The flight was uneventful at first. The Arctic expanse stretched below Jack like a vast, frozen canvas, its white surface fractured by dark ribbons of open water. The barren beauty was hypnotic, the kind of quiet vastness that could make a man feel small. The hum of his engines and the steady beeping of the radar were the only sounds in his world.

As he neared the designated coordinates, his radar emitted a sharp ping, breaking the monotony. Jack‚Äôs eyes flicked to the HUD, his brow furrowing. A contact had appeared‚Äîsomething massive. The object wasn‚Äôt behaving like anything he was used to. It didn‚Äôt have a transponder signal, its radar signature wasn‚Äôt consistent with known aircraft, and it was moving at an astonishing speed, cutting across the radar screen like a ghost.

‚ÄúControl, I‚Äôve got an unidentified object on radar,‚Äù Jack said, his voice steady but edged with curiosity. ‚ÄúNo transponder. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs huge. Sending you telemetry now.‚Äù

There was a pause on the other end, and Jack could hear faint chatter in the background as the mission operator relayed his report. The AWACS plane orbiting miles behind him chimed in, its radar picking up the same anomaly.

‚ÄúViper One, this is AWACS Alpha. We‚Äôre seeing it too. Signature is massive, but it‚Äôs not matching any known profiles. Hang tight, we‚Äôre cross-referencing now.‚Äù

Jack tightened his grip on the controls, his eyes scanning the empty expanse ahead. ‚ÄúHang tight? This thing‚Äôs moving at Mach speeds, and you don‚Äôt know what it is?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working on it,‚Äù the mission operator said, his voice strained. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not on any civilian or military registries. No heat signature, no transponder, nothing. Just a damn big blip on the radar.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù Jack muttered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm sitting out here alone or anything.‚Äù

Before he could say more, his jet suddenly jolted, the turbulence rattling through the airframe. Jack cursed under his breath, steadying the controls as the instruments flickered briefly.

‚ÄúControl, I just hit some serious chop out here. What the hell was that?‚Äù

‚ÄúStand by, Viper One,‚Äù the operator replied. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not showing any weather disturbances in your area.‚Äù

Jack‚Äôs eyes shot forward just as the massive object burst through the clouds ahead of him, its sleek, unmarked surface reflecting the weak sunlight like polished obsidian. It was enormous‚Äîeasily three times the size of his F-35‚Äîwith an otherworldly design that defied conventional aerodynamics. There were no markings, no visible engines, no windows. Just a seamless, predatory shape moving with impossible precision.

His breath caught in his throat. ‚ÄúControl,‚Äù he said, his voice quieter now, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a visual. It‚Äôs not one of ours.‚Äù

‚ÄúViper One, repeat,‚Äù came the operator‚Äôs response, urgency lacing his words.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not ours,‚Äù Jack repeated firmly. ‚ÄúAnd if it is, somebody forgot to send me the memo.‚Äù

The AWACS chimed in again, their voices growing more frantic. ‚ÄúStill no ID on the object. Its radar profile keeps shifting. We‚Äôve never seen anything like this.‚Äù

Jack‚Äôs jet was rocked again, this time by the object‚Äôs wake as it streaked past him with uncanny speed, vanishing back into the clouds as quickly as it had appeared. His heart pounded as he tried to process what he‚Äôd just seen.

‚ÄúControl,‚Äù he said, his voice low but steady. ‚ÄúYou better figure out what the hell that thing is, and fast. Because whatever it is, it‚Äôs not playing by the rules.‚Äù

Jack‚Äôs blood ran cold as the massive, unmarked craft slipped effortlessly through the skies ahead of him, its sleek form almost mocking his attempts to keep pace. He shoved the throttle forward, the roar of his F-35‚Äôs afterburner splitting the frigid air like a thunderclap. Flames erupted from the jet‚Äôs twin engines, propelling him forward with a force that pressed him into his seat.

‚ÄúControl, I‚Äôm in pursuit,‚Äù he called out, his voice tense. ‚ÄúTarget is maintaining altitude at 45,000 feet. No response to identification requests.‚Äù

The aircraft loomed ahead, eerily steady, its lack of visible propulsion systems unnerving. Jack‚Äôs heart pounded as he followed its unpredictable maneuvers, weaving through the Arctic skies. Each time he thought he‚Äôd closed the gap, the craft seemed to slip just beyond his reach, as if it were toying with him.

Suddenly, the object slowed, breaking its steady pace with an abruptness that forced Jack to react. He jerked the stick, narrowly avoiding its wake. His HUD lit up with warning signs as turbulence battered his jet. Then, as if sensing his presence, the massive craft opened a set of hidden payload doors beneath its belly.

‚ÄúControl, I‚Äôve got movement!‚Äù Jack barked. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs deploying‚Ä¶ something.‚Äù

The sight hit him like a gut punch. Inside the payload bay, he caught a brief but unmistakable glimpse: a cylindrical device, sleek and metallic, unmistakably a warhead.

‚ÄúControl, this is not a drill!‚Äù he shouted, adrenaline surging through his veins. ‚ÄúThe target is armed. Repeat, armed and hostile!‚Äù

The line crackled as General Maddox‚Äôs voice came through, sharp and unyielding. ‚ÄúHawkeye, you are weapons free. You have authorization to engage.‚Äù",1,1731984691.0,u_SirBigdog01,0,1.0,False
1gun4tw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gun4tw/my_crow_speaks_to_the_mad/,My Crow Speaks To The Mad,"I sat in the parking lot of McDonald's feeding french fries to my talking crow. We were in the back of Detective Winters's car. He was having the large coffee that costs only a dollar. He had told me he liked it better than Starbuck's, as he took it black.

""Sergeant Ventura was a good cop."" Detective Winters was talking about the policeman that had gotten killed at the crimescene.

""Did he have family?"" I asked.

""He was divorced."" Detective Winters sounded like he could cry for the dead man. ""We were his family.""

I ate my cheeseburger in silence. Cory hopped onto the fries and scattered them to the floor. He looked up at me without an apology for his behavior before he went to go eat some of them.

We were taken to a hotel where we became roommates with Detective Winters. The maid knocked on the door as I was taking off my boots. He answered it with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth that he had lit with hotel matches.

""What is it?"" He asked her. I listened, genuinely curious.

""No animals."" She pushed past him slightly and spotted Cory. Presumably, she would go get the hotel manager.

""It's okay, he is with me. I am a detective. I am solving murders."" He told her, and showed her his badge with a well-rehearsed gesture. She gave him a very admonishing look and left without saying more. I wondered if our sleep would be interrupted. I was very tired and went right to bed.

In the morning the same maid was back, prompting me to wonder if she had worked all night. She glared at us as we left and she went in to clean.

Detective Winters took me to the station and made me sit around with him all day while he did paperwork. He had interviews with people and more paperwork. His job suddenly seemed very boring to me. I already longed to go outside and discover the world out there. I was his hostage because he knew I knew that I was his suspect in a murder.

""I want you investigating this. Looks like it might be the hitchhiker killer. If you can get some cooperation from you-know-who, maybe we can call the FBI on this one."" The boss of Detective Winters walked over to his desk and gave him a thin file on a crime scene secured earlier.

""Let's go."" Detective Winters got up and I followed.

""Who was he talking about?"" I asked.

""A possible serial killer. I know a guy who knows a lot more than he is telling us. First we need to go see the crime scene. Forensics is already there so you will have to wait outside."" Detective Winters was talking fast. He was excited about this for some reason.

""You know this serial killer?""

""Yes. If it is the same one then we've had several killings already. I will need to go see our friend. Then we call the FBI."" Detective Winters explained.

""Is that how it's done?"" I asked.

""It is how we are gonna do this. You wouldn't understand."" He started his car and we left.

""You like it when people say 'you wouldn't understand' to you?"" I asked after awhile.

""Not really. Sorry. I just don't like feeling like I am explaining myself to someone."" Detective Winters gave me some kind of crude apology for the way he had spoken to me.

""Well, I don't really like listening to you anyway."" I offered. After that we just drove in silence. After we arrived at the crime scene, Cory went to the floor of the back seat to feed on the drying fries left there. Detective Winters asked someone he was passing for their cigarette, took it, and smoked it, as he walked away. We were left there alone in his car.

I was tempted to just get out and walk away. I felt that it would be dishonorable. Therefore I stayed, out of a sense that I was doing the right thing.

""What a mess."" Detective Winters came back after awhile. He fished a half smoked butt out of his ashtray and lit it with the car's lighter. Then he rolled down the window to exhale smoke as we drove away.

We arrived at a small trailer where a column of smoke arose from out back. Detective Winters said: ""Come with me.""

The man was just throwing the last papers and files out of an empty banker's box and tossed it aside where several others sat empty.

""Daniel Barrow."" Detective Winters spoke so he would turn around. The man gestured at the destructive act he had committed and shrugged and smiled.

""What can I say?"" Daniel Barrow asked. ""I don't work for you. I am a private eye. You know, an investigator-for-hire.""

""I could arrest you for destruction of evidence."" Detective Winters told the private eye.

""Then do so. I am merely destroying my own pictures and notes. Personal property."" Daniel insisted.

Then we left him there, smoke trailing away with bits of white ash in his hair.

""What a dick..."" Detective Winters used a bad pun.

I chuckled and replied: ""He seemed crazy.""

Something dawned and Detective Winters held his hand up at me for a second while he thought. Then he lowered it and brightly added:

""Dellfriar Asylum."" Detective Winters decided.

""Where crazy people are?"" I tried to follow his jump to a conclusion. I had no idea what he was talking about.

""Where Doctor Evans was killed. That is how I met our friend for the first time. He was caught snooping around that crime scene too."" Detective Winters recalled.

I said nothing as we drove to Dellfriar and gained access to the ancient and fearsome looking seaside castle. It was still medieval compared to other mental hospitals. I had only seen it in pictures, but now the place creeped me out.

""What are we doing here?"" I asked. ""If Doctor Evans was killed by the same person Daniel Barrow would have told you about: then you already know who it is.""

""You are right."" He stared up at the terrifying structure. ""Jesse Darling. She was a patient here. We have a copy of her file. You are right. There is something more I wanted to see again.""

""I'd rather wait here."" I told him. He nodded and left us in the parking lot.

When he came back he looked disappointed. We drove back to the hotel in silence. The next day he met with the FBI and told them what he knew, about a serial killer named Jesse Darling.

Then he found me and told me: ""Her name is Scarlet. She was friends with Daniel Barrow. He visited her often.""

""Now that you have completed that path, why not try another?"" I asked him.

""Scarlet is who we should be looking for."" Detective Winters agreed. ""We will never find Jesse Darling.""

""Then let's start at the beginning."" I advised him. And so we drove back to the crime scene we were at before.¬†

His decision was to drive along the highway from there, heading away from Dellfriar. Detective Winters said:¬†

""I think she has killed six men and she tried to kill Daniel Barrow. He survived.""

As it grew dark a light rain began to fall. The sound of the windshield wipers kept going. My hand began to ache. Up ahead stood someone in a red hoody, hitchhiking with their left thumb. We pulled over.

""Must go now."" Cory cawed.

""Sounds anxious."" Detective Winters noted.

""He is saying we must leave."" I translated. ""He gets jittery.""

""He got a name?""

""Cory."" I took my crow to my lap and gently held him while the back passenger door opened. I looked over at the dark shape in the red hoody. Lightning flashed behind her before she got in to sit with me in the back.

I could feel the damp cold air coming off of her hoody as she seated herself. She was young, although her face was kinda mean looking. As she spoke, she gestured with her left hand, her right never appearing. She said:

""I was walking and this rain started. I just need a lift into town."" And she tried a fake little laugh and smile.

""We can give you a lift."" Detective Winters offered. We started back onto the highway and she reached up with her left hand and got her seatbelt on.

""The hand is silver and it can cut like a knife. Maker of dead men, from living ones. She actually likes doing it, you could learn from her."" Cory told me about our guest.

""Your bird talks."" She smiled. This smile looked real, but still predatory.

""If you call that talking."" Detective Winters chuckled with a masculine disregard.

""I don't know."" I stammered. I was frozen in fear. This was surely our hook-hand hitchhiker. She was definitely Scarlet. I could imagine her weapon striking away half my neck in one instant swipe, out of nowhere. She'd kill the detective next. Only she was wearing a seatbelt: so our corpses would get ejected into the darkness. She'd stay belted to her seat.

""I can understand him."" She smiled coyly.

""You can?"" I was choking. Sweat beaded my forehead and terror gripped my heart.

""He says I am pretty and sweet and that you already like me."" She sighed.

""He said that."" I breathed mechanically.¬†

We pulled into a gas station. Scarlet stayed seated, smiling endlessly at me, her eyes shiny like glass. I had to pee yet couldn't move. I was afraid that if I tried to get out: she would slaughter me.

Detective Winters took his time filling gas, making a long phone call, buying cigarettes and smoking about half the pack. I was in agony: it was either pee myself and probably trigger her killing me, or get out and die trying.

""I really have to pee. Is it okay if I go and go pee?"" I squeaked.

""Sure. Come right back."" She was still smiling like a golden devil at me. I crept away from her and shut the door. Cory was on my shoulder as we obtained the key, attached to a real goat's leg, hoof and all. I went into the bathroom and peed.

As we came out with the goat leg in one hand, zipping up with the other, the parking lot lit up. Police cars swarmed from all around, surrounding Detective Winters's car. I watched while armored SWAT had to drag Scarlet from the vehicle.¬†

Scarlet managed to slash them anyway, drawing blood from three of them. Her hidden prosthetic arm was indeed like a sharp pair of hooks. She whipped out a knife and got one of them in the groin. Blood spurted from his wound and he staggered and fell over.

Finally, they had her restrained and arrested. I went into the gas station to return the goat's leg bathroom key. Detective Winters came into the gas station behind me and selected a lighter to buy. It was with a bunch of lighters with tattoo art on them. His had a little red riding hood, looking scared, and standing in front of a wolf's eyes.¬†

""You're still alive."" He told me and flicked his lighter's flame in front of me before he went back out to the car.

""Death will always happen."" Cory agreed with him.¬†

I just sighed and tossed the goat's leg onto the counter.",3,1731984624.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False

**6 months ago:**

After a year of living and working in NYC, I was informed that my employment contract will not be renewed.   
There were a lot of issues at work that I will not get into here.   
It got so toxic for me that when I heard the news about my contract, I was in shock but also my body felt physically relieved.   
A part of me felt 'Phew.. I don't have to go to that place anymore!'.   
So I knew that it was the right thing for me even though it was a nasty surprise.

I felt very burnt out and disillusioned with my career.  
I liked living in NYC and doing fun things with friends (it was expensive though).  
I could have stayed in the US and sought another job.  
But I felt that I really need to make some big changes in my life and begin by taking a break.  
I felt that I needed/wanted to live in India with my family for a while and figure out what I want to do.  
  
My boyfriend was hurt and wanted me to stay - he offered to marry me.  
He said that he will not force me to stay and wants me to be happy.  
It was very difficult for me to say goodbye to my boyfriend than it was for me to say goodbye to my career.  
After a year of living in NYC, I chose to leave everything behind and move to India.  
Initially, my boyfriend and I wanted to do long-distance relationship.  
But it started to put a lot of strain on both our mental health.  
So I told him that I wanted to break up and remain as good friends (if that's what he wants also).  
We continue to love each other very much and chat on WhatsApp.

  
**Today:**

It's been 6 months since I moved to India.  
I live with my family in a small town in South India.  
I am slowly rebuilding healthy food habits and spending quality time with my family.  
I am teaching yoga (like I always wanted to).   
I have started to learn how to do small-scale eco-farming on a small piece of farm land that I bought.  
I have enrolled in a Masters program and want to become a certified mental health counselor.  
I am working on writing two books - one solo authored and another with a co-author.  
  
Dating / sex life in my town is not ideal (which I knew).   
Other than that, I am mostly happy (in small ways) and live a somewhat boringly peaceful life.  
I have a little bit of savings and therefore I can afford to not work full time for a little while.  
I am staying with my family rent free and mostly eat what I grow.  
Teaching yoga gives me a little structured activity to my day and some side income that I use to buy art supplies, garden stuff, and fuel for my motorcycle.  
I drink coffee and go for rides on my motorcycle.  
I usually read, paint, teach yoga, garden, listen to music, and talk with friends and family.  
Some days I feel lazy and just watch some trash on YouTube.

I don't have much clarity about my future.  
I don't know what job I want to do or where I want to live.  
Mostly I feel that I am ok.  
I do have moments of self-doubt and panic about future.  
But I have lovely friends and supportive family who reassure me.  
So I am doing my best to enjoy every day that I get to spend with my family.  
It's given me a great opportunity to repair a lot of childhood trauma.  
Probably the best part about me living in India with my family is my relationship with my two nieces.  
My brother has two daughters and I am getting to know them.  
We have lovely conversations and do fun things together.

I had a troubled childhood and therefore have a lot of negative traumatic memories about my childhood home.  
When I look back at my childhood and search for happy memories with my whole family, I cannot find any.  
But now I am getting an opportunity to make those memories with my family.  
It feels lovely to spend time with my nieces and get to know them.  
Surprisingly, my family has been mostly supportive and not pressured me about job.  
I understand that I am privileged in many ways.

I am in a weird but lovely place in my life.   
I don't have much (no job, no relationship, no future plans) but also feel like I have everything I need (food, shelter, health, freedom, and loving family).  
May be if I had a puppy, my life would be perfect.. LOL.. We do have an adopted stray dog in our farm.

I have worked for other people for a monthly salary my entire adult life.  
Now I am my own boss and I am still slowly figuring out how to be responsible. LOL

It's about a situation with a friend for over a year that finally ended in me having somewhat of a mental breakdown on the weekend, being in a pretty dark spot. I am currently in the process of finding professional help because I think I need it either way. But let's start at the beginning.  


**Chapter 1: The beginning**  
A women started at my company. She came from a different country and moved here for the job. We quickly became friends, we had lots of mutual intrests and I liked to talk to her. We had a small friendgroup of work friends. It was nice. I got her a gift back then for holiday time since I knew she was far away from home and it might be nice to also get something from someone. I also offered her support since she is in a foerign country.   
Later that year she needed some more help. We started spending a lot of time together and I gladly helped her with her problems. I am genuinly happy when I can support people. Everything was fine. She went trough a tough time, broke up with her long term boyfriend back then who was not good to her which she struggled a lot with. We exchanged dozens of messages daily, talked until early in the morning. When we would be out together I would bring her home and we would talk for hours, and we would play games together. After some time I started to develop feelings for her. One faitfull night we were out together (I helped her for her apartment search and we went for drinks afterwards) and there was a big fight with another mutual friend, so that wasnt a good day. I comforted her, we had some more drinks and then we went for the tram. And suddenly she said that I wasnt well lately, and asked whats bothering me, And I was struggling a bit, thats true, because she had some ""friend"" from a different country she was flirting with and I knew about it and with my feelings for her it did hurt, but it was alright. I tried to brush it off but she kept asking telling me that I shouldnt lie to her when I say that everything is alright.  
Now that to be said, for me its not too big of a deal. I only really develop fellings for people that I already know well enough, so when I develop feelings its usually for friends and it was not the first time that happened. But I also know that its a difficult concept for most people, and having feelings for a friend, and being happy with them when they are with someone else if they are happy, and just getting over these feelings is something that seems impossible for a lot of people. Something inside of me knew that it was a big deal for her as well. Yet after repeated attempts of her to get me to tell her what was going on in my mind I gave in and confessed that I had feelings for her.  
I said that it does not need to be a big deal. She told me that she can forget about it again and we can keep that pandoras box closed. She invited me inside when we arrived at her place and we sat down and she started crying, telling me how her whole life here falls apart, how everyone was right about me and some other tough things. I also started crying trying to tell her that its alright, nothing needs to change between us, we just stay friends. I tried to explain to her that its not a big deal for me because of what I described above and as long as she is alright with it we dont need to keep distance and that its fine. She had an upcoming surgery that I was supposed to accompanie her to. So we for now agreed that we just ignore all this until the surgery is over. I went home afterwards. On my way home I checked in on her via text message because I was worried. She said that she is alright. I told her how important she is to me and how much I value our friendship and that it will be alright. I had to work that day so I went home, took a shower and had to go to work already.

  
**Chapter 2: The Aftermath**  
That same day we were supposed to pick up her mom at the airport, I offered my help. We picked up her mom, went for a coffee and checked out another apartment for her. I am honest, I made a mistake here bringing up the topic again from the night before, I wanted to reassure her that these feelings I have for her are a small part, they shouldnt be between us. She told me that she started talking to her ex again but that she didnt tell him what happened between us because she didnt want him to be ""right"" about something. Afterwards we went shopping for groceries together, it was fun, it was fine. I sneaked a mini rabbit figure (she loves rabbits) into her backpack which she at first thought she accidentally stole. We all went to her apartment and then I left for home. We still messaged that evening and she said the day was amazing.  
The next day there was mostly silence. She then told me that I shouldnt accompanie her to her surgery, and that she needs some distance. Thats the point where I started panicking a bit. I didnt want to loose a friend, I felt like I had a close conenction to her. I could deal with the fact that she didnt have any romantic feelings for me, but I struggled a lot with the thought of loosing that friendship. She also canceled all our plans from before the surgery. I told her that its alright, and that I am avialable if she needs me. I also send a second message if she thinks if everything will be alright between us. I was very anxious. After 2 days she started messaging me, and I messaged her back. I kept it to responding since she told me that she needed some distance. We started writing a lot again actually. After her surgery she stayed in the city for a bit longer. I asked her if I can bring her some welcome home care package when she was back and she said yes. I bought a flower, researching which flower is gifted among friends and which color is appropiate to not make it feel like a romantic gesture, I got her some cake and also an envelop with ticket for a nice zoo for her and her mom. She was struggling financially and couldnt afford them and I knew she wanted to go there with her mom but canceled the plan due to financial reaons. I also wrote her a letter explaining a bit how I feel, I thought it might help clear things up because I was afraid she would take all this the wrong way. That wasnt a smart idea in hindisght since I wrote it during a very emotional evening.  
We talked a bit, she told me she got back together with her ex. I was smiling and wishing her the best. I later told her that the letter doesnt matter anymore and she doesnt need to read it anymore (she didnt read it yet) and that there was a small gift in there for her which she might want to take out. She read the letter and told me that she doesnt know what to say, I told her she doesnt have to say anything to it and that that letter doesnt matter anymore (my anxiety was gone). The days after were pretty normal, she send me some pictures, some messages and then... dead silence. Nothing. Suddenly she wouldnt respond for days if at all. And at first I thought maybe because she is with her boyfriend and I knew he used to be jealous. After some weeks I asked her if there is something wrong between us. I told her that its okay if there is, that I just need to know. She first responded no, to what I just said that it feels like it. The next day she suddenly dropped a huge message, basically telling me what a toxic person I am and that her ex suddenly is a much better person and someone flipped a switch because I am the toxic person in her life now, that she deoes not know how to face me anymore and I was.. a bit shocked. She also brought up the letter and mentioned things that I was sure I didnt put in there. I still had a copy of it, read through it and found the passages she complained about but what I wrote and what she said I wrote were completely different things and I didnt fully understand because I knew the letter wasnt great but also not terrible, and all the passages she mentioned where different from what I actually wrote. Since english is not the main language for both of us I assume that might have been an issue. I just responded that I wish we could have talked about it and that there seem to be a lot of missunderstandings.

So I still had her work computer with me since it had to be repaired before her surgery and she had to work from home still recovering. I asked her if its alright if I bring it to her and she said yes. So I went to her apartnment. She opened the door and smiled slightly. Since she said she didnt know how to face me anymore I just handed her the computer, wished her a great day and went downstairs. When I was in the tram she messaged me asking if everyhting is okay. At first I responded with yes, but I couldnt really hold it back and reponded with no, its not, and that I am upset that we couldnt at least talk about it before our friendship breaks apart, and I also added that I was upset about the fact that she didnt even plan to tell me at first even though I was clearly suffering from that uncertainty and could feel something is wrong, asking her if I really deserve that treatment. We then had some long discussions, where I tried to explain that what she said I wrote in that letter is not what I actually did write and after a day she apologized, telling me that she understand it was just a missunderstanding and that the words about me being the toxic person were not her words but her therapists words and that her therapist told her that she needs to talk to me in that way. (The last part is not the exact wording, she might have worded it differently). At first I was happy that everything was alright between us but It also felt wrong. You dont tell something like that to someone if you dont mean it to at least some degree, right? But I also cared about her still and I was a bit worried. So we stayed in touch. I helped her with her move since she never wanted to ask anyone for help, so I organized everything for her. I started growing more attached to her again but there was a weird pattern, it constantly felt like this was still between us. She would be responsive and avialable to talk and play games one week, and then be unavailable for 2-3-4 weeks. Thats when I started to occasionally worry and I would ask ""Hey, is there something between us? You seem distanced"". She was going through a tough time so maybe I should have been less worried here but I was still worried about our friendship. She would get angry at me until at the end of that year being really mad with me. I remember apologizing to her and telling her that I wont question our friendship anymore and that I will trust her to reach out when she has a problem with me. I got her some gifts again like the year before and asked if its okay to bring them over, it was, and she enjoyed them. She then was unresponsive for 3 weeks, and I just ignored that. She then aplogized for being so unresponsive. We meet up that week, played some games another day and then the weeks after she was unresponsive again. I think it was that moment that I might have recognized that I got a little obsessed with her because that radio silence was painful. I had a bit of an impulsive reaction and removed her from different platforms, basically to not see her anymore online when she would ignore me. We exchanged some messages that weekend and then she asked why I removed her. And I just told her how I felt and that it was an impulsive reaction that I am sorry about but that I think I need some distance from her for now since this friendship is not healthy for me. She agreed and said that its also not healthy for her.  
Overnight she then removed me from everywhere else, left mutual discord servers and let me throw of a server she invited me to. At work she wouldnt even look at me. I got anxious again and wrote her that it hurts that she doesnt even look at me and I didnt want to be removed from her life but just needed some distance. She got mad at me, understandably I guess. I told her that I just wanted to have my friend back, to goof around at work, send each other funny memes and play games with all night.   
After that we had a long break of not talking at all, for months. 

  
**Chapter 3: I had no idea for a title :(**   
There was a point where we had a little argument at work. She didnt do something properly and I told her about it in a review. She got mad at me and I told her that this is what review processes are for, that developers make mistake and I told her that I know she is a great developer. She just told me that she wishes she would have trust the same trust in herself as I have. She was already questioning herself in the past and I was reassuring her. It was also this moment that I felt like we will have trouble working together if  we cant repair this friendship. So I reached out, I still had some snacks for her pet rabbit laying around which I got for a holiday season gift for her. We started talking again although I kept my distance. I noticed that when she was telling me stories which involved her boyfriend she would talk about a friend instead, I knew that because I overheard her telling our manager in a loud argument the same story she told me but instead of referring to a friend she was referring to a boyfriend. She also told me at that time jokingly that I hurt her so much emotionally (in the snese of ""oh, just because you hurt me emotionally so much?"" ) so it felt right to keep a distance. She would occasionally make hints at playing games together but I brushed it off, I felt comfortable with our distance, but I also noticed that my feelings where still there (I think I jsut denied them in the past because I was so anxious about our friendship). I would occasionally get her snacks or drinks that I knew she liked and place it on her desk. I also planned a little birthday suprise with our mutual friend at work, putting maybe a bit too much effort into it making maybe a bit too large/expensive gifts (it was a new drive for her computer which broke which is not large physicall but expensive). And its a pattern that I noticed from myself where I would tend to get way too often little gifts and occasionally bigger ones for her. I wanted her to be happy, but maybe I also still wanted her to see me as a good person? I fear that this played a big role in my behaviour.  
Fast forward, a few  weeks ago she anounced that she will leave and move away, and I got anxious. We started connecting again. I started making plans for our small friendsgroup since we havent met in months, making plans with her as well to go to the cinema and to invite her for lunch before she leaves (we used to do that somewhat regularly, I would most of the time pay for her because I knew about her financial situation, she sometimes complained slightly). I planned some gifts for her as well. I started sending her more messages again like back in the days and she did the same. One day I got her some chocolate when she was frustrated (I was shopping around the corner and was joking that I will come by anyway to pull a prank on her, so she asked for chocolate and I brought her). Then I had a meeting with our manager the day after and lets just say she told me some things about her move and our manager some different things, so she was lying to one of us and I was sure that at least partially its me. Because to me she said she will move in with a friend while to him she said she wants to move in with her boyfriend. (It was just a side note during the talk with our manager, we talked about the team being not to full capacity with her leaving and then we quickly discussed the reasons.)

I mentioned that to her since she complained about not getting a counter offer to me, so I said if the reason she provides is not work related that she cannot expect a counter offer. She got mad at our manager for ""gossiping"" and I just asked her if she still has a problem mentioning her boyfriend in front of me. Then she told me that she has that issue, yes, and that she broke up with her ex and found someone new, and that she lied to our manager because she didnt want to leave on bad terms and he is the issue she had in our company.

It was the first time in over a year that she seemed open to me again. And for some stupid reason later that day I messaged her on a different platform that I am still not really over my feelings for her, and that I am happy for her new relationship and that I hope she will be happy. That I still want to be friends of course and hope we can do all the plans we had for before she leaves and that the distance will hopefully help me leaving these feelings in the past. And that she shouldnt fear any anxious messages like the last time. I cant even say why I did that. She hasnt been responding to that and started ignoring me. Today she called in sick for work and I asked how she is doing - no response. And I messaged her today again explaining to her calmly and not emotional (like I usually tend to be) how romantic feelings work for me, that its just on top of a strong wonderful connection between friends that matters to me the most. That I can be genuinly happy for her relationship despite having these feelings and that it will pass. And I also said that I need that openess between us, I need the possibility to be vulnerable with each other as friends (especially because I knew we used to be before I told her about my feelings). I also said that I know there wont be anything between us and said that I never did anything to pursue her or to make a move.  
I also told her that she is the one who needs to decide if she wants to keep our friendship or not, and that she needs to communicate, not today, not tomorrow, but someday. I said that our friendship was good enough that it deserves a proper farewell instead of fading out in silence. I cannot go through that silence treatment a second time.

She hates long messages, well, she hates them when they are about difficult topics. So her response was ""Are you serious? I thought no long messages this time.""  
I told her that I said no anxious messages this time and that this is a non emotional message with things that needed to be said because there seemed to be so many missunderstandings in the past. And I asked her just read through it with a neutral view.

She set herself to ""Do not Distrub"" afterwards and played games until she went offline.



Thats the whole story and I am genuinly questioning myself, was I a terrible person? Was I even manipulative? I thought the gifts were just little gestures but werent they maybe meant to make me look good as well?  
I also often told her that she is an amazing person and complimented her abilieties because she tended to doubt herself. Although I also reassured her that her decision to move away is the right decision.

I just feel terrible because I noticed that I was really obsessive, and maybe it were attempts of manipulating her? Or at least it looked like it. What if she now thinks that I tried to manipulate her with the gifts and compliments? ",3,1731984157.0,Manipulation,1,1.0,False

The laptop doesn't have a Thunderbolt 3 connection, so the GPU would have to be connected through an ADT-Link to my M.2  slot wich is currently housing my SSD. That would probably have to be moved to an unoccupied 2.5 SATA HDD slot on my motherboard connected with a M.2 to 2.5 adapter. I understand that i should expect PCIE 3.0 x4 levels of bandwidth from my M.2 port, but i might be wrong and i would love your opinion on the matter. I am definitely unexperienced but eager to learn, so i would like to ask any of you if you have advices with:  
\-estimating potential bottlenecks in my setup (CPU, bandwidth ecc...)  
\-choosing a GPU that wouldn't suffer from excessive bottlenecks (i was looking at rtx 3080 and 2080 ti)  
\-potentially, finding setup/troubleshotting guides to help me get through the installation process

\-finally, and most importantly, undestanding if the wole ordeal would be worth to invest in, in terms of potential gains in performance with lets say an ipotetical 2080ti or even a 3080.  
To anyone that took the time to read and/or answer, thank you for your help, any insight is apreciated c:  
I'm planning on eventually reporting back with updates on the project if i decide to go through

* Run it a couple of times with just water, not just the once. You'll be able to smell the metal in the water you pour out.
* Spend several minutes repeatedly assembling and disassembling it to break the threads in, otherwise it'll be stupidly stiff to use. 10 times will be more than enough.
* To avoid wear, when attaching the middle piece to the base slowly and gently backturn it until it jostles into place before screwing it in. Also avoid cooling the machine with cold water as the official guidance says if you care about maximum longevity.
* If you're considering buying a metallic screen to use above the puck, don't. Instead use an additional paper filter. The paper-puck-paper sandwich will make the entire puck immediately disposable and dramatically speed up cleaning afterwards. Older advice will tell you that purpose cut (51mm diameter) portafilter paper filters are hard to come buy at a reasonable price. [This is no longer true.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CX94Q8VG?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)
* If the underneath of the base of the machine becomes wet ***DRY BEFORE HEATING.*** The surface is so smooth that if it's wet the eventual steam will cause it to slide on the heating plate. It'll also cause the machine to heat slower than usual.
* The brew is finished by the time the fluid *just* reaches the bottom of the spout.
* A basic WDT-tool will be superior to any other grounds distribution method. The price point and type doesn't matter as long as the ends are blunt. You could probably use anything blunt and pointy enough in a pinch.
* A portafilter funnel is the most essential non-essential item.
* If the vent/chimney spits water just aim it away from yourself. Nothing is wrong.
* If the portafilter's rim is spitting coffee stop the brew. It means that the portafilter isn't on tight enough.",5,1731982843.0,9Barista,2,1.0,False

1gumh97,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gumh97/stay_with_a_nice_guy_or_try_again_with_an_ex/,Stay with a ‚Äònice guy‚Äô or try again with an ex,"Conflicted is an understatement.

Broke up an engagement recently with 'nice guy'. We were dating for 2.5 years. It started out great then it wasn't. He was cheated on numerous times. I was cheated on- how my previous marriage ended, so would never do that to anyone. He was insecure, needed my reassurance and attention all the time. If I even looked sideway at a man it was assumed I am 'interested'. By profession and hobbies I am around males and females and believe in male/female friendships. His lack of introspection and accountability and a certain incident where he yelled at me for hugging his best friend (and his wife) to say goodbye after a dinner got me to break up the engagement. He promised numerous times to go to therapy etc- all talk no action. He was sure good to me otherwise but made my life hell with this behaviour. He wants to work things out. 

I have an ex I dated 6 years ago. It was undoubtedly the best relationship I had. We just got each other naturally, he influences me to be more and set me on my life path. We lost a baby in the second trimester and it was devastating. We did not handle that well, decided mutually to part ways. There was a deep friendship aside the relationship and we remained friends. Nothing sexual- we think alike, same values, both Europeans. A year before I met nice guy on a one-off night we hooked up and we said don't want to ruin a friendship that means a lot to both of us. Nice guy was absolutely adamant to not to have any male friends, especially not him so we did not see each other or talk for 2 years. Fast forward to now, I went back to the same gym he goes to and tried to avoid running into him. It worked for a while- 3 weeks ago we happened to be there same time. We picked up like nothing happened. I missed our friendship. He professed the same. We met for lunch or coffee or worked out together as used to. Two days ago he sat me down and told me he realized after all those years we were stupid to let each other go and he never had a connection like ours with anyone. Basically asked if I would consider trying again and that he still wants a family and kids- with me. I was speechless.

And now I have no idea what to do. 
My ex-fiance certainly have to change in order to be a good partner. But he thinks I hung the moon and would do anything for me. I am not sure he promises now to work on himself just to keep me or he actually thinks he should change.  

My ex-boyfriend is a self-reliant guy who can be alone for long, not a player- seen it. But that's his dowfall too. I don't want to get my heart broken by repeating the same as before. However can't deny there is something between us I never had either. The level of friendship and how we brought out the best in each other. Unlike with my ex-fiance. 

What should I do?
