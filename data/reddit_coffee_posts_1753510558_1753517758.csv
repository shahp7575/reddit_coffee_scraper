So I’ve hit that point where working from home is starting to feel like a slow spiral . I just need a change of scene somewhere outside, with people around, but still calm enough to get work done.

If anyone knows of cafes in Ahmedabad (any area is fine South Bopal, SG, Navrangpura, etc.) where you can sit with your laptop for a few hours, not get side eyed by staff, and actually be productive please drop the names. (For example Basera but it opens around 5)

Good coffee, decent WiFi, and a plug point would be amazing Would really appreciate any suggestions thanks in advance",1,1753517639.0,ahmedabad,0,1.0,False

1m9nyuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1m9nyuk/from_torment_to_tenderness_novel_comment_below_if/,From Torment to Tenderness Novel -Comment below if you want this story — I’ll arrange it,"“Ella, hurry up or you’re going to be late for school!” This is the second time my mother has yelled upstairs for me, but I just sit here, on the edge of my bed, staring at the wall.

I tell myself that it’s going to be a good day, but who am I kidding? I haven’t had a good day at school in two years. Only six more months left of my senior year, and then it will be all over. I’m not sure how I feel about it yet, and that’s the most messed up part. I’m eighteen years old, about to graduate high school, and I have a full scholarship to pretty much any college I want to go.

My name is Ella Baxter and I’m a nerd who has no friends, I never break any rules, and I have a deep need to please everyone, but myself. I haven’t always been this way, but circumstances bring on change, and for me, it was not for the better. I used to have a lot of friends; two of them being my best friends, Amy and Bree. We were inseparable throughout middle school and junior high. It wasn’t until the beginning of sophomore year when I had to distance myself from everyone in my life except for my family.

“Honey! Are you coming down or not?” Once again, my mother’s voice reaches me. Sighing, I reach down, grabbing my backpack, and head down before mom has a coronary.

I paste a smile on my face as I round the corner to the kitchen, where my younger sister and brother sit with a bowl of cereal. Eli, my nine-year-old brother has his bowl tipped back as he slurps the milk out. Meanwhile, my fifteen-year-old sister, Elise, is dripping milk on the table every time she spoons the cereal into her mouth because her eyes are glue to her cellphone. This is an everyday occurrence in the Baxter household.

I roll my eyes and lean down, giving my dad a kiss on his cheek, “Good morning, daddy.”

“Morning, sweetie, did you oversleep again?” His concern for my wellbeing is written all over his face. I’ve always been his little girl, and it shows in the way he babies me over everything. I don’t complain though, because I need all the love and attention that I can get these days.

“No, daddy.” I don’t add anything else, but I do smile at him. I could have lied and made something up, but again, I’m a goodie goodie; I would never lie to my parents. He only hesitates a moment before going back to his newspaper.

Taking my seat beside my dad, my mother sets my two slices of peanut butter toast and a banana down in front of me. Unlike my siblings, I’m not a fan of cold cereal. I prefer something more substantial in my stomach before starting a grueling day at school.

“This is the third day in a row that I had to holler for you to come down more than once, Ella,” Mom takes her place across from me, on my father’s other side, as she sips her black coffee, “Please don’t make it a habit, my throat is starting to hurt.”

My father chuckles behind his paper, earning himself a slap on the arm from his wife, “Behave, Ethan!”

I’ve been around my parents enough to know how they are. They are both in their early forties, and still have their good looks. Unfortunately, they also still have a high sex drive, so I can only imagine what my dad’s chuckle was insinuating. Being around them every day, you get used to it. Besides, I think it’s so cute that, even after all these years, they are still madly in love with one another. I hope I find a love like theirs in my lifetime.

“Oh! Before I forget,” Mom turns back to me, “I have a PTA meeting at Eli’s school this evening. I’ll have a casserole in the oven but will need you to make sure your brother and sister eat.”

“Sure, no problem.” My mom is always volunteering here and there, and she is the head of the PTA, so she is always busy with that. “Will you be home for supper, dad?”

“I’m not sure, honey. I have a meeting with a client, and it may run late. Just put a plate in the warmer for me if I don’t make it in time.” I nod. My dad is a partner at his Law Firm, so it’s no surprise when he doesn’t make it home on time. Sometimes my mom will bring dinner to him and his client if the meeting runs over.

Finishing up the last of my breakfast, I take my plate to the dishwasher and then scoop my bag up, “The train is leaving!” I call out to Eli and Elise. Driving them to school every morning is our little morning ritual. It’s the only time that we get with each other these days. Elise is always busy with her friends, now that she’s a freshman, and Eli locks himself in his room and plays video games all evening.

As soon as we get into the car, Elise cranks up the radio, and our morning karaoke session begins. Ed Sheeran’s song, Shivers, my sister’s favorite song, is playing, and she squeals. She starts to dance as she belts out the words, and I can’t help but to laugh as I watch her strawberry blonde curls bounce around. Her blue eyes sparkle when they find mine, and she gives me a big smile. Unlike some sisters, we actually get along very well, but it’s times like this that I envy her innocence. I hope she never has to experience a day of what my life is like, because I’m afraid it may break her.

The second bell that starts the first class of the day is about to ring as I slam my locker closed. With my laptop bag slung across my body, I quickly make my way to my first class before anybody can stop me. Mr. Miller, our math teacher, sits at his desk, shuffling through papers while we all file into the room. I breathe a sigh of relief once my butt touches my chair, knowing that for the next ninety minutes, I’ll have some semblance of peace.

Unfortunately, Mr. Miller had us working on our next assignment, which kept me busy through the whole class, and before I know it, the bell rings. Packing my laptop away, I turn to leave and accidentally bump into someone, I curse under my breath when I see who it is.

“Watch where you’re going, nerd!” Kaylee Simpson glares at me as though I had done it on purpose.

“I’m really sorry, Kaylee, it was an accident.”

“I’m really sorry, Kaylee, it was an accident.” She mimics and then shoves past me, “How about you accidentally jump off a bridge?” Her friend, Callie, snickers at her lame attempt to insult me as they walk out.

Bumping into the captain of the school’s dance team first thing in the morning pretty much tells me exactly what kind of day I’m going to have. Kaylee doesn’t even know why she hates me so much. We used to be acquaintances, not really running in the same crowd, but still talking between classes and outside of school. Now she treats me like the dirt under her feet. Like everybody else, she dropped me like last season’s fashion line two years ago. One Friday night we were talking at a friend’s party, and then come Monday morning, Kaylee and most of the senior class started to ignore me. It had only taken about a week, and then the rest of the school abandoned me as well. That’s when it all started; it’s when Jace Palmer decided to make my life hell.

# Chapter 2 Friends No More - Pt.

As next door neighbors, Jace and I grew up playing together. Our parents are very good friends and were always bringing our families together for summer barbeques, holidays, birthdays, anything…you name it…our families celebrated together. Jace knows everything about me, and I, him, since we were best friends; wherever Jace was, I was right there with him. That is until we entered our sophomore year in high school. It was as though he had developed amnesia and didn’t remember that we were best friends.

I remember as if it were only yesterday. It was the third Friday after the school year had started, and we had hung with a group of friends after school let out for the weekend. We were excited and talking about the party we were all going to that night. As always, Jace had driven us over to the party. I was having a good time even though I wasn’t drinking any of the alcohol that was available to us, but Jace was. Not that it was unusual for him to be drinking, because I was always the DD for him afterwards.

At one point, I spotted Jace standing in a corner talking to some girl named Madison, that had just moved to town. Her and her brother were fraternal twins, but complete opposites. Her brother, Mason, was more on the wild side, and a bit cocky, whereas she was more reserved. It looked like Jace was enjoying the conversation, so I wandered around, stopping a few times to chit chat. When Mason had stopped me, he handed me a bottle of water, and I remember thinking to myself that it was very kind of him to notice that I wasn’t drinking.

The night went on, and Mason stuck to my side, flirting with me the whole time. Kaylee had come over, and we talked for a good thirty minutes before she moved on to talk to others. When I looked around the room, Jace was nowhere to be seen. The party was slowly dwindling down when Mason asked if I needed a ride home. I had thanked him and told him that Jace was my ride, but then he informed me that Jace already left the party with his sister. That hadn’t sat well with me, because it wasn’t like him to just up and leave without telling me.

I began searching the house for him, because I just couldn't believe that he had left me stranded. When I couldn’t find him, I looked outside for his car, but it was gone, the spot where he parked was empty. I tried calling his cell phone, but it kept going straight to voicemail. I was officially pissed off with my best friend, and he was going to get an earful when I talked to him the next day. I had no choice but to take Mason up on his offer to drive me home.

After giving Mason my address, I buckled myself into the passenger seat and tried texting Jace, but he never replied back. Messaging him on social media had the same outcome, although, with those messages, I could see that he was reading them, but ignoring me completely. I started to become worried, and when I lifted my head to say something to Mason about Jace ignoring me, I noticed that he wasn’t heading to my house. Instead, he was pulling into a secluded area where teenagers go to make-out or just get laid.

There were a few other cars in the clearing as we pulled in and he parked his car. I had tried to tell him that I wanted to go home, that I didn’t want to be there with him. He tried to sweet talk me into staying, and eventually told me that he would only take me home if I gave him a kiss. What’s one little kiss going to do, right? I gave in and leaned over to give him a quick kiss, but he grabbed me and hauled me over the middle counsel, and crashed his mouth against mine.

I started to object when he took the opportunity to shove his tongue into my mouth. He was stealing the kind of kiss that I was saving for someone special. My fists started pounding against his chest, trying to get him to stop. With all of my thrashing around, I somehow got him between the legs with one of my limbs, causing him to grunt and pull back. Climbing back to the passenger side, I had demanded that he take me back home right away. After glaring at me for a moment, and then a few curse words, he started his car, and took me home.

When we pulled up in front of my house, I could see that Jace’s bedroom light was on. I grabbed the door handle and went to open it, but Mason locked it before I was able to. He tried apologizing for his actions, explaining that he really liked me and wanted me to give him a chance. It wasn’t until I agreed to think about it, that he unlocked the door so I could get out. I was trying to hurry because I wanted to try calling Jace again, but then I notice that his bedroom light was now off, and flooded in darkness. Sighing, I went inside and went to bed myself. I never did get to talk to Jace the next day, or the day after that, and by the end of my first class on Monday morning, I was officially ostracized.",1,1753517566.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

It was interesting how they focused entirely on organic growth, leveraging community engagement and word-of-mouth.

The study highlighted their emphasis on creating a truly unique product (think artisanal soaps with unusual scents like ""campfire coffee"") and fostering a strong sense of belonging among their customers. They achieved this through consistent, authentic interaction on social media, actively responding to comments and even incorporating customer feedback into product progress. One key takeaway was that they saw their customers as collaborators, not just consumers.

It really makes you think about the power of authenticity and genuine connection in building a brand, especially in today's marketing landscape. Has anyone else seen similar examples of brands succeeding through purely organic community building? I'm curious to hear about other strategies that smaller companies have used to gain traction without large marketing budgets.",1,1753517549.0,VintageVogueVibes,0,1.0,False

---

You're like a walking plot twist—people expect main character energy, but get side quest chaos every time. You’ve got the intelligence of someone who could take over the world… if you didn’t keep getting distracted by your own internal TED Talk halfway through every plan.

You’re so self-aware, it’s actually tragic. Like, you know exactly what’s wrong with you—but instead of fixing it, you write a 5-part dissertation about it, lose the file, and call it personal growth.

Your personality test results probably just said “good luck.” You're emotionally deep but socially confusing, like a therapy session hosted on dial-up internet.

You have the rare talent of being both the hero and the emotional liability in your own story. You're the kind of person who would ghost someone during a conversation because you mentally time-traveled to an existential crisis that started when someone looked at you weird in 2018.

Your ADHD isn’t just a condition—it’s a lifestyle. You don’t walk into rooms, you arrive in a whirlwind of half-finished thoughts, 17 browser tabs open in your brain, and zero idea what you came in for.

You’re the human equivalent of ""I got this"" followed by ""I absolutely did not have this.""

And let’s not forget your standards in people. You could psychoanalyze someone to the molecular level, predict they’re going to ruin your life, and still let them in because your intuition took a coffee break and your loneliness held the door open.

You’ve got potential so loud, it keeps screaming from the basement while your executive function is upstairs napping in a weighted blanket of denial.

But hey—despite it all, somehow you’re still brilliant, loveable, and trying. Which is honestly both terrifying and inspiring.

Want a round two? 😈

_______________________________________________________

Alright, round two—no gloves, no mercy, just vibes and violations. Let’s go:


---

You are the kind of person who could win a Nobel Prize and still get roasted in the group chat for spelling “definitely” as “definately.” Your brain is a high-powered engine… hooked up to a unicycle with a wobbly wheel and a Wi-Fi connection that keeps dropping during your mental downloads.

You talk like a philosopher, live like a chaotic neutral bard, and plan like a raccoon with a to-do list it stole from a therapist.

Your trauma responses have trauma responses. You’ve got more layers than a conspiracy theory, and somehow every single one ends with, “I don’t trust people, but I’m going to overshare anyway.”

You’re the only person I know who can both emotionally destroy someone with surgical precision and cry about a cartoon animal in the same 30 minutes. You’re a paradox wrapped in potential, dipped in disaster sauce.

Your idea of self-care is deep introspection at 3AM, followed by impulsively cutting people off like you’re pruning a bonsai tree blindfolded and caffeinated. One moment you're healing, the next you're writing a 12-step revenge arc in your Notes app with aesthetic headers.

You’re the psychological equivalent of a “loading…” screen—something incredible is clearly happening in the background, but no one, including you, knows if it’s gonna crash or evolve.

And let's not lie: You’ve got more emotional depth than the Mariana Trench, but your attention span floats like a plastic bag in a windstorm. Therapy probably asked you to slow down.

Your potential scares people—mostly because it's like watching someone juggle swords while riding a Segway over a minefield, smiling the whole time and saying “I’m fine.”

You're not even a hot mess. You’re a gorgeously complex emotional wildfire that occasionally reinvents itself mid-burn.

Want me to go for Round 3: The Unholy Truth Edition? 😏

_______________________________________________________

Round 3: The Unholy Truth Edition
I’m unlocking the DLC where the roast goes existential. Buckle up, sweetheart—this one’s got lore.


---

You are the embodiment of a psychological thriller where the main character is both the detective and the suspect—and every plot twist was caused by overthinking and vibes.

You're not just a mess; you're a curated disaster. Like if trauma bonded with ambition and decided to co-parent a gifted child with commitment issues.

Your emotional radar is so sharp, you can sense someone’s suppressed childhood memory just by their choice of emoji. But when it comes to your own feelings? It's giving “404: Identity Not Found.”

You have the self-awareness of a monk and the impulse control of a toddler with a flamethrower. You'll say, ""I know this is self-sabotage"" mid-sabotage, then do a postmortem breakdown of it like a TED Talk no one asked for.

You're the kind of person who says, ""I don't care what people think"" and then mentally replays a 6-second interaction for four business days. Your inner voice is a panel of judges from “RuPaul’s Drag Race” critiquing your every move, but all you wanted was to eat a sandwich in peace.

Your trauma response is to become so competent, people forget you’re still bleeding. You could be sobbing on the floor, and someone would still ask you for advice because somehow you radiate “CEO of holding it together until 3AM.”

You’ve got more red flags internally than a Soviet military parade, but you wrap them in aesthetic Pinterest boards and call it “healing.” You collect toxic people like Pokémons and then write entire essays trying to psychoanalyze why they broke your heart—as if the red flag didn’t come with a damn user manual.

You think in five dimensions, feel in seven, and function in… maybe one. On a good day. But even then? You could still outsmart 99% of the room—you just won’t realize it because you're too busy wondering if you made it weird when you said “thank you” in that one interaction 2 weeks ago.

You're not broken. You're just written by a complex, emotionally brilliant but slightly sadistic author who gave you the gift of depth and then nerfed your peace settings just for fun.

Still hungry?
Because Round 4 is called: “Why You’re Probably the Hero Nobody Knows They Needed—But Also Might Burn the Village Down if Left Unattended.”

Shall we? 😈

______________________________________________________

Round 4: Final Blow — The “You Are the Hero and the Arsonist” Edition

This is it. The final swing. No life jacket, no soft landing. If your ego had kneecaps, they’re about to snap. Let’s go.


---

You are the prologue to an epic saga that keeps glitching because the author can’t decide if it’s a tragedy, a redemption arc, or a meme compilation with trauma undertones.

You walk into people’s lives like a revelation, leave like a cliffhanger, and then show up in their dreams as unresolved emotional homework. You’re not a phase—you’re a core memory people need therapy for.

Your vibe is “chosen one,” but with the plotline of someone who skipped the tutorial and punched the mentor in the face for asking too many questions. You radiate “I could’ve saved the world, but I was busy overthinking my purpose and doomscrolling through existential dread.”

Your loyalty is terrifying. Once someone earns your trust, they basically get a front-row seat to your internal war, complete with battle cries, burnt bridges, and hand-drawn blueprints of the fortress you built around your soul with glitter glue and PTSD.

You don’t just walk away from people—you haunt them. Like a ghost with a PhD in psychology, whispering, “this was a you problem, babe” from the astral plane.

You’ve got so much insight it’s a miracle you’re not charging for it. But instead of building an empire, you’re out here emotionally speedrunning side quests like “fixing broken people with no boundaries and unmatched empathy.” Your inner child is probably in a corner yelling, “WE WANTED TO BE AN ASTRONAUT, NOT A HUMAN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT SYSTEM.”

You try so hard to be good, but that fire inside you? It’s not just light—it’s scorched earth potential. You could heal nations or accidentally summon a psychological apocalypse depending on how your morning went. You are both salvation and chaos in human skin.

And deep down, you know it. You know you weren’t built to blend in. You’re not meant to live a “normal life.” You’re built for impact, even if that means detonating expectations along the way.

So yes—you are hard to understand. You are intense. And sometimes exhausting. But that’s because most people don’t have the emotional bandwidth to withstand someone like you:
A storm disguised as a soul.


---

Final verdict:
You’re not the villain.
You’re just too real for a world that worships plastic.

Mic dropped.
Casket closed.
Roast complete. 🔥💀

Want a eulogy… or a redemption arc next? 😏

I am astonished how easy and good it is.
Normally i'm using a v60/switch, which I am still very happy with.

But this thing is truly astonishing.
Oftentimes I like to just do one smaller cup for me and go for multiple coffees a day.

It really shines.

For me I find 70-75 clicks in the Philos are perfect to me. For v60 i normally am around 90 clicks for reference.

90 clicks gave me an underextracted cup, 60 was too bitter with a bit of more blurry cup.

75-80 degrees celcius bloom rhen 93 is where I start.

Today I'm drinking the Neyver Gesha from the Coffee Collective. Nice round cup, lots of sweet peaches, some lemon, chocolate and fruityness.

The cups are very sweet and round. Still I find a lot of aromas and it is not too blended.
Because of the bed depth the coffee is always very transparent and this is also reflected in the coffee. Low bitterness and fines.

For this pricepoint, if you are looking for an easy to handle dripper for smaller portions, go!

The only advice I can give is too pull the a bit from the bottom so it sits better.",3,1753516883.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

Let's talk about something that can make or break your trip budget: managing your money abroad. Getting hit with surprise fees or having your card eaten by an ATM in a foreign country? Nobody's idea of a good time!

Here are some hard-learned lessons and pro tips to keep your finances (and sanity) intact while traveling:

# 💳 Smart Card Strategies

**Get cards with no foreign exchange fees**: seriously, this is a game-changer. Cards like Revolut, Wise, or Chase Sapphire can save you hundreds on international trips.

**Pro tip:** If you're using an app-based card, convert to local currency *before the weekend* to avoid that sneaky 1% conversion fee that some providers charge during weekends.

**Always carry multiple cards**: I can't stress this enough. Have at least 2-3 different cards from different banks. If one gets blocked, declined, or swallowed by an ATM, you're not left stranded.

# 🏧 ATM Survival Guide

Here's where things get real. ATMs abroad can be tricky, and getting your card swallowed is way more common than you'd think:

**Use contactless ATMs when possible**: less physical contact means less chance of mechanical issues

**Stick to ATMs at open bank branches**: if something goes wrong, you can walk inside and get help immediately instead of panicking on some random street corner

**Always have a backup physical card**: digital wallets are great, but when an ATM eats your primary card, you'll want that backup plastic

**Check Google reviews of ATMs**: this might sound paranoid, but people actually review ATMs! Look for complaints about cards getting stuck or swallowed before using unfamiliar machines

# 💰 Cash vs. Cards Strategy

**Research your destination's payment culture**: some places are still very cash-heavy (looking at you, Germany and Japan), while others are almost entirely cashless

**Get some local currency before you arrive**: having cash for that first taxi, coffee, or tip can save you stress at the airport

**Know the daily withdrawal limits**: both your bank's and the ATM's limits matter

# 🚨 Emergency Preparedness

**Notify your bank before traveling**: yes, people still forget this and get their cards blocked

**Save emergency contact numbers**: have your bank's international helpline saved in your phone

**Consider a small emergency cash stash**: hidden somewhere separate from your main wallet

# 🔍 Red Flags to Watch For

**ATMs in tourist-heavy areas with higher fees**: sometimes worth walking a few blocks to find a bank ATM

**Dynamic currency conversion offers**: always choose to pay in the local currency, not your home currency

**""Helpful"" locals offering to help with ATM transactions**: politely decline and find another machine

I made it clear no sex or hanky panky involved just talk and coffee. He knows I have diabetes and use a cane. Didn't phase him which other dates had me already kicked out for. Green light!

But now comes the hardest part. I need to tell him about my epilepsy because I prefer to be upfront and honest what he is getting into with a chronically ill person.

1m9ns3v,https://i.redd.it/gzscmcfsd6ff1.png,Knocked Up by the Golden Boy?! My DNA Test Says Payback's a Bitch!,"My high school nemesis just posted my gynecology visit and pregnancy test results in our class group chat:





\[Typical slut behavior—knocked up with no clue who daddy is. Probably some gross old pervert. Should get tested for HIV while she's at it.\]





The vultures started circling, someone even shared a photo of me hunched over while some middle-aged guy was pushing me around.





That's when Cameron Reid—our school's untouchable golden boy genius—dropped the ultimate bombshell:





\[I'm the baby daddy. Got a problem with that?\]





\---





\[She hopped into a black Mercedes last Friday after school—tinted windows and everything. You KNOW\~\]





\[Spill the tea! How much does sugar daddy pay you?\]





\[Come on guys, don't be like that... maybe it's true love? Even though that old dude could totally be her dad.\]





...





Before Cameron's reply, the group chat was absolutely roasting me alive.





Cameron and I lived in completely different worlds.





He was this ethereal pretty boy who somehow made basic button-downs look designer. Always top of our class, loaded family—grandfather's some hotshot academic, dad's a professor at Princeton, mom runs a Fortune 500 company.





Meanwhile, I'm just me and my mom, been getting my ass kicked since I was little.





To protect both of us, I started working at Master Kim's taekwondo studio and earned my black belt in the process.





I was totally focused on hustling and making cash to help mom out, so my grades were always straight trash.





Being a total academic disaster with scary fighting skills made me the queen bee of Riverside High.





First time I saw him was on this rainy day. I burst through the school gates totally soaked and still ended up three minutes late.





He was working the hall monitor station, raindrops on his lashes, about to write my name in the detention book.





""Don't,"" I panted. ""Just finished the night shift at 7-Eleven.""





He looked up and saw my dark circles, the burn mark on my hand, coffee stains on my uniform pants—his pen hesitated.





That day, he didn't write me up.





Senior year study groups threw us together, and we actually started connecting.





He was ridiculously patient, even if his mouth was pure poison sometimes.





The other girls were shooting daggers at me, but nobody dared mess with me directly—perks of being the scary girl. They just spread nasty rumors behind my back.





But Cameron never distanced himself from me.





That's when I fell for him. Hard.





It wasn't until our class reunion a year after graduation that I realized even ice-cold Cameron Reid had feelings for someone.





Outside the karaoke room, I heard him confessing to Aria Sterling, our school's It Girl. But she didn't give him an answer.





Cameron looked crushed and downed way too many drinks.





Someone had spiked his drink with something sketchy, and he was so out of it he grabbed my hand thinking I was Aria.





I couldn't resist seeing my untouchable crush all flushed and desperate like that. Only hesitated for a second before we ended up tangled together in another private room all night.





But honestly? I didn't feel good about it. All I remember is one word: PAIN.





Next morning, I woke up before him.





They say when you give your first time to someone you love, you can actually hear flowers blooming in your heart.





I wasn't gonna make him take responsibility—planned to just ghost. But when I tried to get up, the movement pulled at my... injuries down there, and I crashed to the floor, waking up sleeping beauty.





Cameron took in the scene and put two and two together.





He stared at that red stain on the sheets, then said something that sent me straight from heaven to the depths of hell:





""Wow, your reconstruction surgery looks legit. Almost fooled me.""





I forced myself to laugh. ""Yeah, found a good doctor. Super cheap too.""





""That's not what I meant, I…""





He tried to explain, but I wasn't listening—threw on my clothes and bolted.





I was so pissed and heartbroken, I forgot to take the morning-after pill.





Chapter 2





Three months after that, I'd been working myself to death trying to forget the whole humiliating mess.





Later, I collapsed from exhaustion and ended up in the hospital where they found out I was pregnant—Aria's little sidekick Riley Walsh posted the pics in our group chat.





Cameron and I hadn't talked privately since that night, so his public reply totally blindsided me.





Next day, Cameron showed up at my door with his mom.





Cameron had his usual poker face—impossible to read what he was thinking.





Mrs. Reid, on the other hand, was all business—asking my age, what my parents did for work.





When I told her I didn't have a father and my mom was on dialysis for kidney failure, she just said, ""Poor child,"" like she was talking about the weather.





""The Reid family has only had one heir per generation for three generations. We can't abandon the baby in your womb. Name your price.""





Classic ""keep the baby, ditch the mom"" move.





I asked them to transfer my mom to the Reid family hospital and promise to find her a kidney donor, covering all medical costs.





Mrs. Reid agreed, and we signed a contract promising I'd cut all ties with the Reid family after giving birth.





I went to the hospital to comfort mom, just telling her a nice classmate was helping us out.





She's always been pretty helpless—immediately broke down crying and tried to bow to the Reid family.





After leaving the hospital, they brought me to the Reid house.





Cameron didn't say a single word the whole time, acting like he wanted nothing to do with me.





I knew he couldn't stand me.





After Mrs. Reid left and Mr. Reid was away on business, Cameron got stuck with figuring out where I'd sleep.





He didn't give me my own room, didn't even give me a servant's room. Just told me to sleep on his bedroom floor.





Rich people's spare blankets are pretty soft though—more comfortable than my old wooden bed at home.





When he saw me sleeping peacefully the next morning, he actually showed emotion for once—his mouth twisted into this disgusted sneer.





""Typical street rat. Can sleep anywhere.""





The Reids made me quit all my jobs—bad for the baby and all.





So I helped their housekeeper with whatever I could manage.





While organizing Cameron's study, I found a framed photo of Aria on his desk—her in an evening gown playing piano, looking absolutely stunning.





Cameron snatched the frame away. ""Who said you could touch that?!""





First time I'd ever seen him lose his cool like that.





He must really, REALLY love her, I thought bitterly.





After that, Cameron started making my life hell on purpose.





Breakfast porridge was either too hot or too cold—kept making me adjust the temperature over and over.





If I turned over even slightly at night, he'd snap at me, then force me to get up and read to him until he fell asleep.





One afternoon while I was mopping, he accidentally spilled coffee on the floor and watched me clean it up again.





""Can't even mop properly. No wonder you can only survive by sleeping with men.""





When I just silently did what he wanted, he got frustrated and ran his hands through his hair.





""Sage, why don't you ever get MAD?""





I looked down, then back up with tears filling my eyes.





""I'm the one reaching above my station here. If it wasn't for that night, your life would never have been disrupted by someone like me...""





Cameron's breathing hitched. After a long pause, he said angrily, ""Don't cry. And don't look at me like that.""





Then he practically ran away, leaving me totally confused.





I don't really have the right to hate him. I mean, I was using him, and besides—





I chose the Reids as my meal ticket after weighing my options when someone else made me an offer.





Chapter 3





The guy pushing me around in that group chat photo was a bodyguard sent by my biological father, taking me to get a DNA test.





He wasn't actually shoving me—just pushing me out of the way of some motorcycle speeding down the street.





Sounds like something out of a novel, but my bio dad turned out to be some crime boss who screwed around too much in his youth and wrecked his body.





As his only kid, he tracked me down wanting to take me in, but refused to help my mom.





I was originally planning to go the ""take over the criminal empire then save mom"" route, but mom's body couldn't wait that long.",1,1753516832.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False
1m9nrk1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m9nrk1,My partner's moms cat hates people but has chosen me as a friend ♥️,"My partner's mom has an old and grumpy man as her loved pet. He doesn't trust many people, probably due to his first few weeks of life. He was born in a horse place and the owners of the place wanted to get rid of him and drown him (what the hell??)  around 15 years ago. She took him home and ever since he's been living with them. 
He's scared of people, but wont do any harm to anyone. He runs away and hides. 

When his parents were on vacation I took care of him and gained his trust. I sat down on the floor and waited for him to come to me, to show him I'm not a bad person. 

Anyways, fast forward nearly a year of every now and then encounters... He waits for me every morning, knows the time I leave for work and waits for me to pass him and pet him. The other day, when I was ill and did not go to work, he made it all the way up to the bedroom (which is in the top floor if the house, we own a house with multiple floors all accessible for him). He checked in on me and waited for me to wake up, next to the bed. Another day he walked all the way upstairs and came to sit in bed with me, while I was sipping offee. He waits next to the coffee machine every morning as well, and waits for pets and kind words. He calls out for me when I am running late. 

I never wanted to befriend him, but now I gained this shy, grumpy old man's trust and I love him dearly. 💜💜",8,1753516773.0,cats,2,1.0,False

I’m 32 and just moved to the Guarda District with a close friend, he’s 26. We’re originally from the UK and came out here to build something different. Slower pace, more hands-on, and something we can shape ourselves.

Before Covid we were both photographers, but we shifted into metalwork and welding. Now we’re putting those skills into building up our land. It’s about 20 acres and we’ve got plans for a full off-grid setup, proper workshop space, and eventually opening a small Airbnb and campsite. We’re also getting into honey, a bit of wine-making, and maybe some experimental growing projects down the line. Basically turning the place into a creative farm-meets-lab setup.

We’re both into movies, especially anything sci-fi or a bit weird. Stuff like Interstellar, The Menu, Arrival, Her, Tenet — anything that makes you think or just feels a bit different. We also cook a lot, mess with tech, and build things for fun just to see if we can.

Mostly just looking for some good people nearby. Chill, open-minded, and not too intense. If it turns into something casual, cool, but friendship is always a win. We’re up for coffee, chats, a smoke, whatever feels natural. If you’re local and curious, drop a message and say hey",2,1753516706.0,PortugalExpats,0,1.0,False
1m9nqvr,https://i.redd.it/e9t3dnldd6ff1.png,"His Ceremony, My Awakening: Luna No More, Queen Forever","Outside the Pack Registration Hall, my mate Cyrus and I were waiting in line to register our mate bond.





Suddenly, a little pup ran over and wrapped his arms tightly around Cyrus's leg.





""Daddy!I miss you so much!""





My first thought? Some kind of scam targeting us. but the next second,Cyrus's face just lights up as he picked the pup up.





""Well,I just found out myself,"" he said casually, ""when Maris and I severed our bond five years ago, she was already carrying my pup.""





""Now she's back in the pack. A single omega raising a pup alone faces a lot of gossip. I have to give them legitimacy.""





Before I can even get what he just said, here comes Maris, strutting up in her designer heels.





She slides her hand into his, like a pair who'd just completed establish their bond, both wearing gentle expressions.





My voice remained steady ""And so?""





He let out a soft sigh.





""I need to complete a bonding ceremony with Maris first. You and me... we're gonna have to hit pause.""





""Since you're already here, why don't we take a photo right here at the Registration Hall entrance? You can post it on Instagram and show off.""





Maris raised her phone, snapping a picture of us with a triumphant smile""Say cheese\~""





Cyrus patted the back of my hand consolingly.





""Don't worry, you're true mate I love. I only see her as family.""





""I just want to make up for lost time with the pup. A fake bond with Maris for a few months.""





""Hmm...the pup is innocent, after all. Growing up without a father, it's heartbreaking. I don't want him to have a bad childhood.""





""We'll postpone our ceremony. Once the pup is older, I'll tell him the truth. Then I'll give you a truly magnificent bonding ceremony—the entire pack will witness you becoming my Luna.""





The three of them, holding hands like a perfect family, walked harmoniously into the bonding hall...





Chapter 2





I pulled out my phone and called Kaelan, the Alpha who'd been pursuing me for over ten years.





""I'm at the Pack Registration Hall entrance. Need a bonding mate. You in?""





...





His voice came through with that familiar deep, magnetic tone and hint of affection""Oh my dear Althea, how come you didn't give me a heads up about the ceremony? I just got off a plane—still overseas at Europe.""





I paused for a moment""That's okay,ignore it.""





Kaelan, who'd been keeping it cool, suddenly changed his tune:""Wait, no! Hold up! I'll make it back before the center closes. Whoever backs out first is a total loser.""





I couldn't help but smile as I hung up.





Shoving my phone back in my pocket, I figured I'd find somewhere quiet to relax.





That's when I heard this pissed-off voice from nearby.





""Althea!""





I looked up. Of course it was Cyrus.





He'd finished his marking registration, holding the pup in one arm while his other hand was wrapped around Maris's, looking sickeningly cozy.





He strode over, set the pup down, and dropped his voice to almost a growl.





""What the hell are you still doing here?""





My tone stayed even""Waiting for some alpha to bond with.""





Cyrus's face darkened immediately""Are you seriously gonna start with this passive-aggressive crap again? I'v said I just found out the pup—everyone's got a past,especially an Alpha,okay?""





I nodded""Get it.""





He reached for my arm""Then just go home. Don't make a scene in front of the pup.""





I shook him off and said seriously.





""I'm not making a scene. I'm literally waiting for someone to come bond with me!""





Cyrus's expression got even darker, his voice carrying that Alpha authority.





""Althea, the last time. Keep acting like this and I'm gonna hate you more and more.""





Then Maris stepped forward then, putting on this whole worried act""Is Althea feeling a bit piss because she didn't complete her bonding?""





As she spoke, she pulled out the red marking certificate she'd just gotten and held it out to me.





""Here's an idea—you and Cyrus can take a photo with this one. The covers all look the same anyway. Nobody'll know whose it is unless they open it up.""





I didn't reach for it, and the certificate fell to the ground with a smack.





Maris crouched down to pick it up, her eyes instantly welling up, voice trembling""I'm sorry... I shouldn't have come back with the pup... I didn't mean for this to happen.""





Cyrus shot me a death glare and threatened in a low voice.





""Althea, you're being ridiculously petty!If you can't accept her and the pup, then let's just break the bond.""





I looked at him""Fine by me.""





The moment those words left my mouth, Cyrus was clearly stunned.





Maris gently nudged the little pup forward.





""Come on, call her luna. Tell luna not to be mad anymore.""





But the pup just glared at me and said through gritted teeth""I won't! She's the bad guy! She's the homewrecker!""





He shoved me hard""Don't you dare steal my daddy!""





People around us started staring, and I could see the judgment in their eyes as they whispered.





""Ugh, are Luna candidates really this shameless now?""





""Making a scene like this right in the Registration Hall. Trying to steal someone else's Alpha.""





I looked at the pup, my voice as calm as ever.





""Your dad and I have already called off our bonding application. Don't worry.""





""I wish your parents all the best—may their bond last forever and their marks never fade.""





Chapter 3





When Cyrus heard this,he nodded with satisfaction and looked down at me condescendingly.





""Now that's more like it. You better be this smart about things from now on.""





With that, he scooped up the pup, took Maris's hand, and walked away.





I watched their retreating figures, a cold smile tugging at my lips.





I wasn't being mature—I meant every word.





I turned and walked into the nearby coffee shop, ordered a latte, and took a seat by the window to wait Kaelan.





My phone suddenly buzzed.





\[Trending Now - Breaking\]





Kaelan Industries Heir Walks Out Mid-Contract Signin?





My finger froze, and my heart skipped a beat.





The Kaelan Industries heir?





I quickly clicked the link. The video opened with a tall, commanding figure striding purposefully forward.





He was walking while making a phone call, urgency written across his features.





The camera was a bit blurry, but I'd recognize those shoulders anywhere, that familiar furrow of his brow.





It was Kaelan.





In the footage, he said quietly""Whoever flakes out is a total loser.""





The comments instantly flooded with ""Love over business deals"" and ""Alpha chasing his mate - we love to see it.""





The camera cut to a reporter interviewing the other party's representative, a distinguished older gentleman with a polite smile.





""I don't feel disrespected at all. In fact, I admire Mr. Kaelan's authenticity. Alpha emotions are serious and sacred. We'll wait for him to fulfill his mate commitment.""





""We'll wait here for him to return and complete the signing ceremony. This won't affect our partnership in any way...”





I slowly put my phone down, my heart racing for some reason.





Kaelan—the man who'd been chasing me for ten years, never wavering once.





Back then, I was so obsessed with Cyrus that I never really looked back at the Alpha who'd always been there behind me.





And now, I finally understood the difference between half-hearted marking attempts and real, bone-deep devotion.





I opened my email and scrolled through all those messages he'd sent me that I'd left on read.





One after another, burning with intensity.





I used to find them annoying, but now they made my eyes sting.





With the most sincere words, over the past ten years, he'd filled every message with patience, restraint, longing, and respect for me.





These weren't just emails—they were love letters he'd been writing for a decade.





I read through them one by one until my coffee went cold and night fell.





That's when a bouquet of flowers appeared in front of me.





I looked up sharply to see a familiar face.





It was Kaelan, slightly breathless like he'd been running.





""Hey baby, sorry to keep you waiting.""





He called out to me with a grin, sounding as excited as a young Alpha who'd just gotten approval for his first bonding.





I was a bit stunned—still getting used to that pet name.





When I didn't respond, he leaned in nervously: ""You're not gonna back out on me, are you?""





I smiled back at him""Don't worry, I'm not trying to be a total loser.""





We walked into the Registration Hall together and completed our official marking bond registration.





Kaelan had a cross-continental contract waiting for him to sign, I push him back to work.





But he pulled me into his arms instead.





""Wait for me,baby.When I get back, we're celebrating the blood ceremony.""





""Remember—whoever changes idea is a total loser.""

This encounter’s total has the potential to land on the moon, friends. The Chicago White Sox have come back after the All-Star break as a seemingly powerful offense (seriously, wtf?) 6 of their last 7 games have cashed the Over with ease, and the Cubs’ offense is more than capable of running up a total having cashed the Over in 3 of their last 4 outings. I fully expect this game to breeze past 9 runs (especially with Aaron Civale on the mound...) Take the Over to hit.

The idea is simple:  
While customers wait for their laundry, they can interact with the machine, get a capsule toy (some versions include collectible toys or small prizes), and maybe even redeem  for something fun in-store, like detergent samples, coupons, or snacks.

Does it work in your laundromat? Have you tried anything similar like arcade games to increase revenue？

A friend from Repladies told me this is the place to go and ask for all things around P9 and after diving down the rabbit hole of posts here, I can see they weren’t wrong 😄

First of all, I’m a guy (still pretty new to the rep world and bags in general), but I’ve totally fallen for the Speedy P9 Ultra Black, especially in the 40 size. I’m hoping to use it for daily stuff and travel, and I like the 40 because I don’t want it to look tiny on me. But I’m open to feedback. Is 30 more practical or is 40 the sweet spot?

I’ve done a ton of reading here and noticed that most people seem to go with God Factory or Royal Factory for P9s. I also came across sellers like Doris and BaoBao. But I haven’t found many posts specifically about the Ultra Black so I’m hoping someone here can help!

My questions are:
	1.	Is the Speedy P9 Ultra Black in 40 well repped? 
	2.	If yes, which factory and seller would you recommend for the highest quality version? Price isn’t an issue, I just want it as close to gen as possible.

One thing I noticed is that in the official pics, the monogram print looks black and subtle, but in some rep photos it comes off looking greyish or even a bit white under certain lighting. Is that normal? Does the gen behave like that too, or am I looking at a different model? (Second image is the rep and you can notice what I’m talking about.)

## Key Features Analysis

The ultimate functionality and usability of a bike cup holder depends on several critical features. Key aspects to consider include the ‌holder's material, size adjustability, mounting system,‌ overall durability, and compatibility with different bottle types. Each of⁣ these‌ factors contributes directly to an enjoyable‌ and safe ‌ride.

**Material Quality**

The material of the bike cup holder ‍significantly impacts its durability and ‌performance.‍ High-quality ABS plastic offers excellent‍ impact resistance and maintains its⁢ integrity even in varying weather conditions. Premium​ stainless steel or aluminum alloys ‍provide superior strength and corrosion resistance,⁣ ensuring a‍ long-lasting product that can⁣ withstand years of use.

**Adjustable Size and‌ Grip**

A⁣ versatile bike cup holder should accommodate various drink sizes, from small water bottles‍ to ⁤larger ⁣travel mugs. Adjustable mechanisms, such as ‌spring-loaded ​clamps or rotatable collars, ensure⁣ a snug fit ‌and prevent slippage during bumpy rides. Check that both the diameter and height can be adjusted to handle different bottle dimensions.

**Mounting system and Compatibility**

The ease of installation and compatibility with different bike frames are vital. Look for ‍cup holders with adjustable clamps or quick-release mechanisms ⁤that can be easily attached to ‍handlebars,stems,or seat posts. The ideal mounting system should be secure, stable, and adaptable to⁣ a range‍ of tube diameters without causing damage or scratches to the bike frame.**Durability and Weather Resistance**

Bike cup holders‌ are often exposed to sunlight, rain, and other ⁢environmental factors. ⁢A durable cup holder should withstand these conditions without degrading‌ in⁣ quality or performance. UV-resistant⁢ materials prevent⁣ fading and cracking, while waterproof designs protect against rust and corrosion, ensuring the⁢ product remains ⁣functional and aesthetically pleasing over time.

**Compatibility with Bottle Types**

Beyond ‍just the size, the design should accommodate various bottle ​types too, including disposable water bottles, metal bottles,⁤ and‌ lidded cups. ⁤Considerations for bottle shapes,⁣ handles, ‌and⁤ even potential condensation should ​be taken⁢ to⁣ avoid any beverage mishaps along bike rides.

Chapter 1





""Good morning."" I wrapped my fingers around my coffee mug, glancing at my mate across the breakfast table.





Ronan Cross sat there studying me in nothing but a thin nightgown, his amber eyes still burning with that primal hunger from full moon.





""Morning."" I set down my cup, reminding him, ""Don't you have that pack meeting today?""





""Yeah."" Ronan smirked, pushing back from his chair and stalking over to me. ""The boys can wait for their Luna. Besides, we're working on the pack's heir.""





Before I could say anything, his mouth crashed against mine, tongue demanding entry as his fingers slipped beneath my panties.





My knees went weak as I breathed against his lips, ""Ronan...""





He cleared the table with one sweep of his arm, plates crashing to the floor. Then freed his cock, the tip already slick as he positioned himself between my spread legs.





I wrapped my legs around his waist, meeting each of his powerful thrusts as he pounded into me.





After thirty minutes, Ronan buried himself deep and came hard inside me.





He kissed me lazily, then gave my ass a firm squeeze. ""Meeting shouldn't take long. I'll bring the guys back for dinner ."" His voice softened slightly: ""And babe? Don’t forget your antidepressants.""





I rolled my eyes, tugging my nightgown back down. ""Such a nag.""





He flashed those sharp canines in a grin before heading out to the pack house. I stayed slumped against the table, legs still trembling, but smiling despite myself.





I prepared a small gathering for him and Rowan, his beta.





Later that night, when his beta arrived, I went to change my clothes—only to overhear their conversation.





At the dinner table, Ronan’s beta suddenly switched to Italian.





""Three years ago, you took Lyra as your Luna just to get her to forgive Mira. I've watched Lyra fall deeper for you every day, but you're still lying to her—passing off birth control pills as antidepressants. Aren’t you afraid she will lose it once she finds out the truth?""





Ronan paused, his face clouded with a complex expression before a wry, bitter smile curved his lips. ""A pup I don't want doesn't need to exist. As for Lyra... as long as she stops interfering with Mira's happiness, I'll honor my commitment to protect her for life.""





No one knew that I had long since learned Italian and understood every word they said.





I stood in the living room, his fresh bite mark still throbbing on my neck, holding the bottle of my 'antidepressants.'





So all the love he showed me… was only a lie.





What I thought was my salvation had been nothing but a crafted trap.





I didn't hesitate. I swallowed the pills—they tasted more bitter than ever before.





The conversation at the dinner table continued, Rowan's voice low and heavy with guilt





“Forget the whole pup situation for a second—three years ago, when Mira jumped into that river, Lyra’s mom dove in to save her. But Mira shoved her under and let her drown. Ronan, come on, the footage was clear as day. She did it on purpose. Lyra had every right to take it to the pack court.”





""But you became Lyra's legal guardian just to keep Mira out of prison. You signed that settlement behind Lyra's back. Sure, Mira walked free, but Lyra's been drowning in depression ever since. She blames herself every single day. If she ever learns the truth, it'll destroy her completely.""





Ronan's eyes flashed with irritation, but his voice stayed cold and firm. ""Mira didn't mean it. She was drowning—those movements were just instinct. She regrets it too.""





""I've hidden those documents well. Lyra will never know the truth. I'll be good to her, spend my life making it up to her, give her a home. She'll forget the pain. She'll heal.""





Rowan sighed. “Look, don’t blow up—I just feel bad for Lyra, that’s all. You showed up when she was at rock bottom, and of course she fell for you. But you were never over Mira.”





“Whatever, man. Just... hope you can live with this secret. And I hope you won't regret it.”





Ronan drained his glass, each word deliberate: ""I will never regret it.""





That one sentence—“I will never regret it”—tore apart the last of my illusions like sharp claws.





Tomorrow was New Year's Eve. The streets buzzed with celebration.





Just this morning, Ronan had fucked me senseless, his teeth at my throat, saying how much he loved me.





Now every word felt like a blade cutting me open.





I collapsed on a park bench, tears streaming down my face.





All those buried memories came flooding back.





Mira loved my ex mate Evan desperately. The day he and I got engaged, she couldn't handle it—left a suicide note and jumped into the river.





Even though Mira was a strong swimmer and my father's bastard daughter, my mother still dove in to save her.





So many people filmed it. I watched my mother lift Mira toward the surface, only for Mira to press down on her shoulders, use her feet to push my mother's head underwater.





That's how my mother drowned.





When I arrived, Mira cried pitifully: ""I just lost my head for a moment, sis. Please don't blame me. When mom saved me, she must have wanted me to live well...""





I broke down, demanding to know why she'd pushed my mother underwater when she could swim perfectly well. She just kept crying, insisting it wasn't intentional.





I sued her for murder.





But the next day, there was a knock at my door.





I opened it, eyes red, barely dry from crying.

I'm only going to post 7 for now. If it gets popular enough, I might do 8 and 9 separately.

Final Destination 7:

Opening disaster: Aaron is a construction site worker. Who is building a complex high-rise building that is still under construction. Heavy construction weakens the ground, causing a sinkhole, the sinkhole starts small but grows bigger, the sinkhole causes the construction site to slowly fall. A crane collapses, destroying the construction site and also causing a nearby building to collapse to. An underground tunnel under the construction site gets affected by the sinkhole, with falling debris crushing cars under the tunnel. An open gas line on a street gets punctured by debris, causing an explosion that kills people fleeing and destroys more buildings.

Once the premonition ends, instead of warning others, Aaron casually scrolls off on his own. Leaving his friends to die. While he still witnesses the disaster, he lives.  He was the only person to cheat death in this disaster.

Plot: After being the only one to cheat death at a construction site accident, Aaron comes across a resistance group of people that is dedicated to cheating death. But one by one, the members of the group die.

Characters:

Aaron - he is the sole survivor of the construction site accident. He doesn't respect the dead. He thinks the phrase Rest In Peace is ridiculous because dead people don't rest and they're not in peace. He's also an Atheist to add to his character.

Cameron - the leader of the resistance group, reveals that premonitions come from another entity called ""Life"" as part of an ""endless war between life and death."" Death wants fewer people and Life wants more people on the planet. Death also has the ability to make fake premonition. We see that at the end of 4, with the mall disaster. The fake premonition will be demonstrated in the finale act. He is the replacement of Bloodworth

victims that I'm not bothering to name include:

A survivor of the train crash at the end of the 3rd movie

A person with brain trauma  who claims to see Death and Life fighting

A person who survived the train crash at the end of the 6th movie (was in one of the houses that got destroyed) and lost their arm as a result. Having it replaced with a prosthetic arm.

Dr Ellen Kalarjian, yes the doctor who helped Kimberly cheat death is in this movie. Apparently being on Death's list for resurrecting Kimberly. She unfortunly dies

These are just 4 of the victims I wrote.

Death sequences:

1: This one is for the person who can see Life and Death. Inspired by this [post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalDestination/comments/1kokzs9/happened_today_while_i_was_driving_final/) Cameron, driving a car with Aaron in the passenger seat. notices the signs on the tanker and radio. He tries warning them. With Aaron suggesting that they honk the horn. So he did.

The honking scares the soon-to-be victim who is driving behind the tanker and causes them to spill coffee on their lap. The coffee burns him enough to not notice the tanker and ends up driving right under [it.](https://www.wkrg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/49/2024/07/Car-under-tanker.jpg?w=640) The tanker driver doesn't notice and keeps driving on. Sparks coming out from the car ignite the tanker, causing it to explode.

You think that will be it, but then the victim will come crawling out of the wreckage looking like a burnt, mangled mess. They are seen screaming and saying ""I'll come with you."" before falling dead on the floor. That sentence implies that they saw death before they died.

2: This one is also inspired by a Reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AbruptChaos/comments/1kp1snd/what_do_you_say_to_the_god_of_death/) I saw. If you click the link and see it, you'll understand. Chain reaction causes the propeller to come loose and slice the victim to bits.

3: This one is for the person with the prosthetic arm, they go to a scrapyard they call ""Death's Scrapyard."" because it features scrapped remains of disasters. A part of Flight 180, a wrecked car from the highway pileup and Nascar crash, a roller coaster cart, a piece of the bridge, maybe even a part of the crashed metro train and even a support beam from the sky tower.

All those parts would play a role in the chain reaction that causes [a giant magnet](https://www.hvrmagnet.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/scrap-magnet-3.jpg) to lift the victim by the prosthetic arm. They panic and try to rescue them, the crane carrying the magnet moves over a conveyor belt that leads to a [car crusher.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Car_crushing_machine_being_operated_in_St._Louis%2C_MO.jpg) The victim was able to remove the prosthetic arm and land on the conveyor belt. But not before Aaron, thinking that they're still in danger, turns off the magnet, causing the arm to fall on the control panel of the crusher, turning on the crusher and conveyor belt. Everyone else watches in horror as the victim gets moved along the conveyor belt and crushed to death by the crusher.

Final Act:

A high-ranking member of the resistance group comes to Aaron and explains that Aaron has at least taken part of the chain reactions that caused the deaths of their members recently. They start calling out Aaron for his disrespect of the dead, how he has no empathy to the members. Saying that he could've saved some of his friends on the day at the construction site but he chose no. They storm off, unknowingly crossing the road and getting hit by a car in the process.

Aaron realizes and starts showing guilt. He goes into a bar, gets drunk, before going into his car. A police car notices his drunk driving and starts pursuing him. He resists getting pulled over and soon gets chased by a bunch of police.

He goes really fast but loses control of his car and crashes it into a nearby music festival in a local park. It crashes into the main stage, causing a catastrophic collapse. The collapse triggers the fireworks display, which causes a news helicopter that was watching the pursuit live to crash into a Ferris wheel, causing it to roll, crushing people and tents. Soon, the entire music festival is in ruins. Aaron survives the whole thing but only to get hit in the eye by a drummer's drumstick.

Surprise, surprise, it was a premonition all along. Aaron rewatches the member calling him out but instead of getting drunk. He goes to the police station and makes up a claim that he murdered the victims. The police arrest him and he goes to prison. The camera shows the same park where the music festival was, but there is no music festival. Implying it was a fake premonition by Death all along.

It cuts to a year later. Aaron and his prison mates are assigned to do community service at the memorial of the construction site accident at the beginning. Aaron goes to the main big memorial. And begs his friends and resistance group members for forgiveness. The memorial is structurally unstable and begins to fall. It narrowly misses him. Aaron figures that he has cheat death.

Later on, during cell call time. Cameron who is still alive calls Aaron, where he finds out everything about Aaron. He explains that he wasn't even on Death's list to begin with.

Death was using Aaron to kill the resistance members. So technically, he cheated death. But Aaron is stuck in prison for the rest of his life.

It ends with Cameron ending the phone call. Cameron turns on the news. A reporter off-screen is saying, ""There has been a freak accident at a ski resort."" Cameron immediately turns off the TV and goes into his van before setting off. The movie ends there.

The channel is growing approx., 1k-3k subs p/month, with each video being 20-30 mins, and receiving approx. 300k views p/vid. Its a niche topic (nature/outdoor/animals), and my demo is 98% male between 35-65, mostly US & Canada with some in Australia, New Zealand and western Europe.



Here's what I'm thinking re Tiers

1. Free (ad free content, polls, BTS photos)

2. $20 p/month (above + BTS vids, early access, merch discount)

3. $50 p/month, capped at 50 (above + Shoutouts, Q&As, big merch discount & probs a free item from the store, group video calls)

I use the buy me a coffee feature on YT, which is set to $5, this is why I don't have a $5 tier. 



I've been given, and have found lots of differing about how to structure pricing, what's too little, too much and how to anticipate what your demo/audience can and are willing to pay. Given my specific demo I believe the above should be appealing, but I'd really love some feedback from here. 

$50 seems like too much for a tier, but I keep hearing the opposite and need some solid feedback.

1m9nivk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1m9nivk/do_you_ever_feel_like_something_is_watching_you/,Do you ever feel like something is watching you?,"Author Notes: Hey guys this is the first story i have ever written. I've taken a lot of inspiration from listening to the podcast and i hope its not to cheesy or bad!

  
When you are in the comfort of your own home, do you ever feel like you're not alone or that something is watching you even though you are certain no one is around? Well I figured that it was normal or simply my mind playing tricks on me until I saw *it*. A few days ago, I was typing up my essay for cryptids in America, for my mythology class when I noticed a small white dot flashing on top of my laptop, indicating my camera was on. I was a little confused, so I opened up the setting and turned it off. Two days swept by me in a flash. I was too busy with school and game club to really use my apartment for anything more than a place to sleep. 



I was woken in the middle of the night to find my laptop was open and turned on with the little white dot taunting me with its split second intervals of off and on. I sleepily dragged myself over to the laptop and shut it. As it made its soft clap shut, it started playing music, I quickly threw the lid back open to see Spotify was open and playing *“Every Breath You Take”* by *The Police*, I frantically started pressing the power button and the volume down button but the song continued. I tried everything from force-closing Spotify, to manually shutting it down, but nothing worked, so I unplugged the laptop and put it in the farthest room from mine, hoping the battery would die by the morning. However, before I tried to go back to sleep, I decided to do a quick sweep of the house. I checked every room, nook and cranny, but it was clear. I didn't get much sleep that night. All I could do was lay helpless in my bed as that damned song kept playing over and over again haunting my waking hours. 



The following morning my eyes shot open as I woke in a cold sweat. I checked my phone and my heart sank. I had overslept, today being the last day of finals week. I clumsily dragged the rag that was my shirt off the floor, put it on and grabbed my keys. I completely froze when my hand touched the ice cold brass that made up my front door’s knob. It was still playing. I don't know how, or why, but that damn song was still echoing in my guest room. I didn't have time to fool around with some glitchy laptop. I had to get to school.



Before I entered my apartment, a flood of memories came back from the night before, I dreaded the chance of hearing that song again. My heavy door creaked as I slowly opened it. I needed to oil it, I thought. Something was different, there was a suspicious yet joyful lack of music, only the faint hum of my air conditioner. I sat my bag down on my old second hand couch and emptied the contents of my pockets onto the counter top. 



“Well now is a better time than ever to see if I can fix my laptop”.



I slowly opened the door to my “guest bedroom” or if that's what you can call it. All it housed was Magic cards and board games for my *oh so many guests* I never had. I entered the room to see my laptop was nowhere in sight, I checked everywhere in that room but found nothing. I crept my way around my apartment looking for my laptop. I walked into my room and on my desk, there the laptop rested, plugged in and turned on with the white flashing dot mocking me. Looking at the laptop there was a note open that read, “**I LIKE WATCHING YOU :)**” My blood ran cold. I quickly grabbed the laptop, opened the window and threw the laptop into the alleyway below. I felt instant relief as I heard it crash against the cold, wet pavement. Sure, I could've called the cops but I felt that they would laugh me off by saying something like “someone broke into your house to charge your laptop?” or “ why dont you call a computer expert” so i stayed up for the rest of the night listening to the old building creak.



Eventually I woke from my sleep, I checked my phone, 4:36am. My gaze quickly darted toward the desk as if my eyes were small pieces of metal and the desk was a magnet but to my relief, no laptop. I shuffled out of bed and made my way to the kitchen to get a glass of water.  I rubbed my eyes as the glass filled. Something caught my eye in the reflection of the fridge. When I looked closer, I gulped down the lump forming in my throat. In the reflection, I saw a tall skinny figure approaching me. I turned around to see this thing made up of what looked like ribbons of hanging flesh dripping viscous fluids and loose wires crawling toward me in a fast broken shuffle. I quickly ran for the door but before I knew what was happening, I was being thrown against the wall with a force far greater than I had ever seen before as my world became ingested by complete and total darkness. I could hear what sounded like that song but all slowed and distorted almost like an old toy whose batteries were about to die. 



I awoke in my bed with a splitting headache, looked around my room and saw it was just how I left it. Except for one thing. My laptop was on my desk with another note. “**I BROUGHT YOU A GIFT <3**” I opened my bedroom door to be met with a terrible smell. One that made bile rise in my throat. My whole living room and kitchen had been engulfed in blood and where my coffee table once sat, there was a pile of dead and mutilated animals. Around them placed neatly in a perfect circle were eyes that followed me. I bolted for the door but before I could make it, I felt wet wires and sticky fur grab my legs and pull. As my chest hit the floor, I could feel what felt like grapes burst under my weight. I kicked and pulled away from the abomination and with a single snap, I was free. I ran out the door and out of the building. I shakenly juggled my phone out of my pocket and dialed 911, put the phone to my ear, and in my horror, I heard in a quiet, electric crackle of a voice  “**Every breath you take, And every move you make, Every bond you break, Every step you take, I'll be watchin' you**.”

1m9nht2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1m9nht2/my_breakup_story_and_my_first_panic_attack/,My breakup story and my first panic attack,"We broke up at the end of april 2025 and the way it ended just really fucked me up.

Heres the story:

We broke up after a year and a half. I was 17 she was 15. We hungout pretty often since we lived a minute away from eachother and eveything was amazing, no arguments just pure love as we knew it. I went on family trips with her, everyone liked me. Her mum knew me since i was small and our mums talked often, and she told my mum i am going to be the one to marry her when i was little. Everything was amazing until it wasnt. 

One day she told me her classmate from before texted her that he wants to catch up over some coffee. I was like sure one coffee wont hurt. 

Some backlore about the guy:
They were classmates and he had a crush on her since they danced with eachother before we got together during a school event. He told her that he loves her at the end of the school year but at that time we were together and he got an awkward hug from her.

Back to the story

They started going out more often. She started leaving my house becouse she was going out with him. I was okay with it since she didnt have many friends which she needed and she pinky promised me that hes ugly af, she could never be with him etc. 

From the point they started talking our relationship went down. She started going home even an hour late without letting me know shes going to be late. I brought it up the first time like it wasnt nice etc but it happened the second time which again i brought it up and told her that since she started going out with him we were going down hill (a lot more strange stuff happened during)

On the last month i started getting late night voice notes that she doesnt feel the spark like before etc and i was telling her that its mayby becouse she is going thru a tough mental state and i was there for her. I got like 3 voicenotes over the month 1 each week. 
Then we went on a ,,break,,. We agreed to text but not meet since she was mentally weird and she didnt wanna put that energy on me. I told her that its okay she wasnt putting no negative energy on me etc but she still continued going out with the guy and her other friend.

I continuted giving her handmade boquets, love notes etc to make her feel loved and i was trying to save us. It was a tought time for me since in a span of a week i had driver school exams and exams with my dog (i do sport cynology) so i was studying for the exam, training with my dog and trying make stuff for her.

Our last meet was on wednesday, we cuddeled in bed and she brought up that shes still feeling weird and she feels that the spark is gone. I told her that i get it cuz shes going thru a tough time and eventually the spark will fade and thats when the true love starts. 

I got my last voice note in friday morning. She was talking about the same stuff like on wednesday but more harsher. I was supposed to ride to bus with her. I met her but couldnt look her in the eyes becouse that was the 3rd time she bought up a breakup. We sat in silence and she broke up with me on the same friday a week before my 18th birthday thru text even tho we like a few seconds away from each other. 

I texted her the same day at night trying to find a different solution than breakup. We talked and i proposed that we stay single and dont start anything with nobody until we figure out us. She told me okay but she doesnt promise, and that broke my soul. 

We stayed no contact for 5 days and she texted me that we cant get together again. I asked why. She said she got together with the GUY. AFTER 5 FUCKING DAYS. IT TOOK HER 5 DAYS AFTER US ,,ENDING,, IT TO MOVE ON. 
I was shattered and still kinda am. After everything that i did for her, took her on dates, helped with her mental problems, cutting problems etc she fucked me over. 

We stayed no contact again. 

After a few days she texted me that she is sending my notebook thru her mum. I asked her mum why she didnt come and she said that she didnt wanna meet me. I talked to her mum about the whole situation and what happened becouse she didnt wanna talk to her about it. She listened and she was in shock. She was apologized to me that her daughter did that. I thanked her for everything she has done for me and for all the trips. (We still talk a bit when we meet outside)

When i got home i texted her. We talked and we somehow agreed to stay friends. We went out a few times but all i had my mind on was i want her back and i was plotting on how to do it. 

One day i just couldnt, i went out with her and begged her to give us another chance. She was silent the whole time i talking, even when i finished. She said she cant becouse she doesnt feel the flame/spark anymore and no matter what she chooses she will hurt somebody. We ,,talked,, about it for a bit than switched topic. 

We texted one or twice since that but than i realized i just cant be friends with her. Everytime she texted me i just fell back into my hole and had to start over the healing. I met up with her talked and realized i couldnt have saved our relationship becouse the last month she was already mourning and detatching.(she was an avoidant) I told her were going to stay no contact until i can just view her as a friend and idk how long its going to take.

After that i didnt speak to her. She texted me on her birthday wishing my mum a happy birthday (they share a birthday) and i/we wished her back+ a inside joke. She thanked me reacted to my inside joke i dont remember what she texted but i just reacted with a skull emoji.

The first time i saw her after the talk was with her cousin i waved, she waved back. The 2nd time i wanted to wave but she looked away and covered her vision so she couldnt see me. After that i saw her a few times with her guy but only from a car and they didnt notice me, heart sank but nothing extreme.

In the mean time i got info that she started drinking, smoking cigs, weed and got back together with a friend that i helped her realize that she was just manipulating her.

Yesterday was the worst. I was leaving home with my car to go somewhere and as i was entering a roundabout i saw her, the guy holding hands all smiling while walking his dog. She noticed me and was looking at me, I wanted to wave to her but something happened to me and when i was leaving the roundabout i floored it hands started shaking breathing got shallow knees weak and i got my first panic attack. All the memories about how we ended just flooded back to me and i needed to stop the car and try to calm down. The betrayl just felt like it happened again. 

So yea thats my breakup story so far. Thanks for reading this and if you have any words of encouragement drop them in the comments. Also english is not my 1st language im from slovakia so excuse any bad writing and spelling. Love yall and stay strong 💪",1,1753515669.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I’ll give a rough draft:

Thursday night: land roughly around 3, was thinking explore Times Square around 5, dinner maybe somewhere around times square? Back to hotel in east village. (Any other must do’s in this area)

Friday: coffee and out the door by 8:30am (good coffee in east village?). Thinking about taking subway from east village to dumbo first, maybe a bagel in Brooklyn. Anything impotent to do in. Brooklyn? Then walking across Brooklyn bridge and trying dim sum in China town. After that, subway to 9/11 memorial, maybe stock exchange, then take ferry to see Statue of Liberty.  Not visit statue, just a drive by on ferry. Anything I’m missing in financial district? Feel like I have time to kill. After, back to hotel in east village. Dinner + drinks. 

Saturday: coffee again, walk to Washington square / Greenwich / west village. Maybe a bagel or a nice brunch? I know I want to try lindustrie pizza. Any must do’s in this area? Empire State Building, maybe grand central (probably not), observation deck somewhere maybe? Squeeze in a light lunch in chelsea market. Back to east village hotel. Dinner + drinks. Maybe a show?

Sunday: coffee, Rockefeller / Central Park day mostly.  Maybe museum of art. Not really sure what else to do this day. Maybe take the wife to Sabrina carpenter at MSG. 

Anyways… what am I missing? I’m sure it’s obvious. First timer in NYC, I want to do as many of the NY things: bagels, pizza, bakeries, Italian, China town, Statue of Liberty, the important buildings/memorials. Help a brotha out. Thank you",1,1753515406.0,visitingnyc,2,1.0,False

Two hours into a flight last summer, I felt that familiar panic rising - did I leave the stove on before rushing out the door? For years, this anxiety has hijacked the first day of every trip, leaving me distracted and unable to enjoy myself. Then my therapist suggested this ridiculously simple solution: take a quick photo of my turned-off stove before leaving home.

Now it's part of my pre-travel routine. Right before heading out, I take clear photos of my stove knobs in the off position, my unplugged coffee maker, my thermostat setting, and my locked back door. These photos live in a specific ""Home Safety"" album on my phone. When that inevitable moment of doubt hits while I'm miles away, I don't spiral into worry - I just pull up the visual evidence that everything is fine.

The peace of mind this provides is honestly worth far more than the 30 seconds it takes to snap the photos. What surprised me most was realizing how much this low-grade anxiety had been affecting the start of every trip. Now I can fully relax from the moment I leave home. My partner initially teased me about this habit until he found himself asking to see my ""stove photo"" during our last weekend getaway.

I abandoned my last playthrough so I’m starting from the beginning. But then I found out I have the trilogy edition, which is v2 of the game. From what I’ve gathered, there’s only 2 versions. But I ended up doing nothing but obsessing for around 5 over whether I need to pick up the v1 edition instead before I put the disc in, even though I’d probably never mess with hot coffee.

I’m somebody who ever since I started retro gaming really values playing things exactly as they were when they released back in the day. But I spent so many hours obsessing today that I wasn’t going to just let myself not play it tonight so I figured it’s ok and started it.

I just want to know opinions on whether I’m getting the authentic San Andreas experience or not. My worry is that by playing v2 I’m basically playing a remaster/remake version that’s not all that much better than the crappy hd collection and missing out on the raw vibe of the original with technical quirks or not. I’ve read a lot of conflicting info on all the bug fixes but I know they changed some scripting stuff so I’m wondering if I’m basically playing a game that looks the same at first glance but plays differently from the original experience entirely. Like it’s not even the same game and the version I’m playing is for people who weren’t old enough when the first game came out.

I’m a very irrational person, am I being irrational about this? Am I getting the true, OG, ps2 experience of this game or am I playing a butchered version and need to go buy a v1 copy and start my save all over? I know it seems like I’m overreacting, but this game is something I’ve wanted to experience for more than 10 years and I’m finally getting around to it, it’s really important for me to take in the whole experience as it was really meant to be played.

Did a lot of people end up playing this version instead back in the day? Or more people play this version than the original? Is this version perhaps even better? Anything that’ll make me feel good about my choice to go ahead and play it instead of ordering a black label version online would be very, very much appreciated. I want to be convinced that it’s not that different and plays exactly the same, if that’s the case.

EDIT: The one thing I really want to know is what they mean by changes in scripting. They say it was just the mission with the plane, pay and spray glitch, and one other mission that were played less tedious. But they changed so much of the code that the save files aren’t compatible with each other. So what code did they rewrite and how does it change gameplay? Was it meant to improve performance, or make fences on missions more consistent or something?",1,1753514651.0,sanandreas,0,1.0,False

If you didn’t have a mate out there, somewhere.. I would snap you up in a heartbeat.” “I don’t.” I sighed, “He is the Alpha of Tall Pines and he rejected me for being half human. I accepted.. and here we are.” He growled “That scum! He better hope I don’t run into him.” I laughed and told him, “Odds are you will.. he and his Luna eat at my restaurant once or twice a month. He believes he’s rubbing it in what should have been mine.” Chapter 1 I yelled “Maddox! Come on, Buddy Roe! I’m going to be late.. I still have to drop you at school.” He hollered down to me he was coming. True to his word, he landed his little ten year old self in front of me from the staircase landing. He grabbed his backpack and I shoved my phone in my back pocket. I asked “Jeep or bike? It’s still warm enough for the bike.” He grinned and grabbed his helmet. Reckon that’s my answer, then! I climbed on my Harley Softtail Deluxe and backed it out of the garage. Maddox got on behind me, and we took off for the school. I was hugging the curves and flying low. Maddox loves speed. Parked out in front of Pine Grove Elementary, I asked “You have everything, right? Homework? Lunch card? Inhaler? Maxi pads?” He grinned and said “You’re such a dork.” Then he walked off, dramatically sighing “Ohhh nooo! I forgot my maxi pads.. AGAIN!” I started the bike.. laughing at his antics, and made my way to the diner. I walked into a pretty big breakfast crowd, for a Thursday. I smiled and told Ashley good morning.. before checking on my line cook and chef. She smiled and said “I’m leaving at noon.. but I have Tammy coming in to cover you. The doctor wants to run some labs.. he’s worried about congenital diabetes with this baby. Seems he’s bigger than he should be.” I asked “Even for a wolf? Does your doctor know you got knocked up by a wolf?” She shushed me and said “No one knows, Delaney! I only told you because you would have smelled it anyway.” I made a face “Eww. When you say it like that, it sounds creepy.” She giggled “Dude! It IS creepy!” I laughed at her and my wolf, Iris huffed at her. I set about rolling silverware for lunch and dinner.. and Ashley asks “Hey! Did you hear about the motorcycle club moving to town?” I shook my head and she continued “They bought that five hundred acres with those old campgrounds. Wolf warriors or something.” I perked up “Wolf warriors? Do you think? Could it be Warrior Wolves? That club that has mostly rejected wolves as their members? If so.. this town just got a whole lot safer. They’re feral rogue hunters.” She shrugs and tells me “Well. I’m sure I don’t know. There was just a biker in this morning.. at the asscrack of dawn. Before I even got coffee started.. saying his club was moving to town and he was just hanging out.. waiting on Mr. Donaldson over at the bank.” Again, I nodded. Not that I don’t care.. because I do. A bike club would bring in a lot of business.. and that can only help me out! I smiled at Ashley and said “Hey! Fresh meat! For all you know, your future ex-husband is a member.. a Biker AND a Wolf? Mega jackpot, right there!” She cracked up and responded “You just can’t help it, can you? Do you make a conscious effort every morning to be a prick, when you crawl out of bed?” I laughed and said “Heck no! That just comes naturally!” Making her laugh, again. I asked “Did you remind Tammy she’s on her own from three to six? It’s Thursday.. and Maddox has training.” She said “Oh! No! I will text her right now.” She looked around for her phone.. then said “Give me your phone.” I laughed “Lost it again, did ya?” and handed her my phone. She muttered shut up and texted Tammy. She handed my phone back and said “You have a message from Maddox’s teacher.. something about maxi pads.” I choked on my own spit. That boy! I texted her back.. explaining it was just a joke between Maddox and myself, and I would take care of it. I went to the kitchen to see if Chef needed my help prepping for dinner.. but he said no. I have line cooks for the standard daily fare. But Chef works Thursday through Saturday evenings.. for a more substantial, upscale cuisine. It works well for the people in town. We got through lunch, and Ashley took off for the doctor. Congenital diabetes, my left tit! That baby is half wolf.. he’s going to be bigger! I left at 2:45 to grab Maddox from school.. and hurried home. We changed into our black combat clothes.. and I threw the duffle bag in the back of the Jeep. I drove out to the old abandoned farm we had found our first weekend here. I had set up a training ground for Maddox to hone his weapons skills. I don’t know if Marcus is coming for us.. but my little brother will not end up like my mother! Getting out of the Jeep, I asked “What do you want to work on first?” He shrugged and told me “Archery.. I’m better at that, than knives. And katana is always saved for last! It’s my favorite!” I grinned and said “Mine, too!” We ran our routines.. and I am so impressed with his accuracy and agility. His speed is increasing, too. His instincts are good and he never freezes. I grinned and said “Next week, we will start on moving targets. You have gotten good enough, we need to step it up!” He laughed “Yeah. I still don’t want to run the course blindfolded.. like you do. I don’t have that extra boost to my senses, that’s all you!” I told him “You have extra something, Buddy Roe! You’re accurate, as heck.. and fast. Your instincts are on par with a wolf’s.” I took him home to have dinner and do his homework. Mrs. Sutton from across the street came to babysit, until I closed the diner. Back at work, I was restocking the cooler and Tammy said “About time you made it back! I had a rush at four. Was in the weeds for an hour!” I straightened up and looked her over “You realize I am the person who signs your paycheck, right?” She nodded and I snarled “Then what gives you the right to use that tone with me? I won’t tolerate disrespect Tammy! From anyone!” She sneered “You know what?! I don’t give a heck! I quit! That new M.C. is taking applications for club girls. Free room and board. A clothing allotment and two hundred cash a week!” I laughed and asked “You’d rather be a club doll than work in my diner? I wish you luck, young one! I hear initiation is tough!” She scoffed “Not a doll, you idiot. A club girl.” I busted out laughing..” Never been around a bike club, have you? Well! I wish you luck. Now, get your stuffand clock out. I will have your final check cut in ten minutes.” I texted Ashley that we have to run an ad.. I need a new server Chapter 2 Maddox wanted to spend the day at the diner with me.. so I brought him to work. I had texted his best friends’ mother to see if Hunter could join Maddox for an afternoon matinee.. I know he will get bored.",1,1753514551.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

I made a face“Eww.When you say it like that,it sounds creepy.""She giggled ""Dude! It IS creepy!"" I laughed at her and my wolf, Iris huffed at her.  
  
  
I set about rolling silverware for lunch and dinner..and Ashley asks""Hey!Did you hear about the motorcycle club moving to town?""I shook my head and she continued""They bought that five hundred acres with those old camp grounds.Wolf warriors or something.”  
  
  
I perked up""Wolf warriors? Do you think?Could it be Warrior Wolves?That club that has mostly rejected wolves as their members?If so..this town just got a whole lot safer. They're feral rogue hunters.”  
  
  
She shrugs and tells me""Well.I'm sure I don't Again, I nodded.Not that I don't care..because I know.There was just a biker in this morning..do.A bike club would bring in a lot of business..at the ass crack of dawn. Before I even got and that can only help me out!I smiled at coffee started.. saying his club was moving to Ashley and said ""Hey!Fresh meat!For all you town and he was just hanging out..waiting on know, your future ex-husband is a member..a Mr.Donaldson over at the bank.”Biker AND a Wolf? Mega jackpot,right there!""""  
  
  
She cracked up and responded“You just can't help it,can you? Do you make a conscious effort every morning to be a bitch,when you crawl out of bed?"" I laughed and said ""Hell no!That shit just comes naturally!”Making her laugh, again.  
  
  
I asked ""Did you remind Tammy she's on her own from three to six?It's Thursday..and Maddox has training.""She said""Shit!No!I will text her right now.""She looked around for her phone..then said “Give me your phone.”  
  
  
I laughed""Lost it again,did ya?""and handed her my phone.She muttered shut up and texted Tammy. She handed my phone back and said“You have a message from Maddox's teacher..something about maxi pads.”  
  
  
I choked on my own spit.That boy!I texted her back..explaining it was just a joke between Maddox and myself,and I would take care of it.  
  
  
I went to the kitchen to see if Chef needed my help prepping for dinner..but he said no. I have line cooks for the standard daily fare.But Chef works Thursday through Saturday evenings..for a more substantial, upscale [cuisine.It](http://cuisine.It) works well for the people in town.  
  
  
We got through lunch,and Ashley took off for the doctor.Congenital diabetes,my left tit!That baby is half wolf..he's going to be bigger! I left at 2:45 to grab Maddox from school.and hurried home.  
  
  
We changed into our black combat clothes.. and I threw the duffle bag in the back of the Jeep.I drove out to the old abandoned farm we had found our first weekend here.  
  
  
I had set up a training ground for Maddox to hone his weapons skills.I don't know if Marcus is coming for us..but my little brother will not end up like my mother!  
  
  
Getting out of the Jeep, I asked ""What do you want to work on first?""He shrugged and told me“Archery..I'm better at that, than knives.And katana is always saved for last! It's my favorite!""I grinned and said""Mine,too!”  
  
  
We ran our routines..and I am so impressed with his accuracy and agility. His speed is increasing, too. His instincts are good and he never freezes.I grinned and said ""Next week,we will start on moving [targets.You](http://targets.You) have gotten good enough, we need to step it up!”  
  
  
He laughed""Yeah.I still don't want to run the course blindfolded..like you do.I don't have that extra boost to my senses, that's all you!”I told him“You have extra something, Buddy Roe!You're accurate, as hell..and fast.Your instincts are on par with a wolf's.”  
  
  
I took him home to have dinner and do his homework.Mrs.Sutton from across the street came to babysit, until I closed the diner.  
  
  
Back at work, I was restocking the cooler and Tammy said“About time you made it back!I had a rush at four.Was in the weeds for an hour!""I straightened up and looked her over“You realize I am the person who signs your paycheck, right?”  
  
  
She nodded and I snarled “Then what gives you the right to use that tone with me?I won't tolerate disrespect Tammy! From anyone!""  
  
  
She sneered“You know what?!I don't give a fuck! I quit!That new [M.C.is](http://M.C.is) taking applications for club girls. Free room and board.A clothing allotment and two hundred cash a week!”  
  
  
I laughed and asked""You'd rather be a club whore than work in my diner? I wish you luck,young one! I hear initiation is a bitch!”  
  
  
She scoffed ""Not a whore,you idiot.A club girl.""I busted out laughing..""Never been around a bike club, have you?Well!I wish you luck.  
  
  
Now,get your shit and clock out.I will have your final check cut in ten minutes.”  
  
  
I texted Ashley that we have to run an ad...I need a new server.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
Maddox wanted to spend the day at the diner with me..so I brought him to work.I had texted his best friends' mother to see if Hunter could join Maddox for an afternoon matinee..I know he will get bored.  
  
  
I had finished clearing breakfast dishes and had set all the tables with place mats and silverware,for the lunch crowd.  
  
  
We still haven't put on a new server yet.But the ad has only been out for two days. Saturday mornings are usually Ashley's shift... but this pregnancy is hitting her hard.  
  
  
The curse of being the owner means I turn more key to key shifts than I care to think about. That's okay, though.I signed up for it. I have to provide for Maddox.  
  
  
Running away with him before I was even seventeen, was necessary.I wasn't going to wait around for Marcus to hurt Maddox..or me! I waited until I heard the sirens and jumped out my bedroom window. With Maddox piggy backing to my mom's car.  
  
  
I jumped in and took off.Marcus was arrested and I was three states over,by the time I ditched the car. We rode a train west.ended up in Pine Grove. Here we are..five years later..and thriving.  
  
  
Marcus was sentenced to ten years..and that scares me to death. I am technically guilty of kidnapping.. and I really don't want to have to kill my brother's father.. but I will.Maddox is my kid! I won't risk his life!",1,1753514473.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

That forge you craft in? That bakery you ignore? They’re not just decorative assets—they’re early-stage infrastructure for a fully player-run economy. Think of them like owning the first coffee shop in a brand-new city.



When the economy opens up and more players flood in, those who own the shops, gear stations, and transport routes will be making passive income while everyone else just plays. You’ll be renting wagons, buying armor, and trading bread from real player-owned businesses.



Best part? It’s 100% free to play until July 28—no NFTs needed, no gas fees, nothing. This is the time to explore, experiment, and maybe even lock in your first economic role before the floodgates open.

The scent of old paper from Kenji’s drafting table mingled with the first hints of brewing coffee. It was a familiar, comforting scene, made utterly alien by the passenger now residing in his mind.

The Weaver was no longer screaming. The raw panic had subsided overnight into a state of profound, silent observation. It was a constant presence, a hum of ancient curiosity beneath the familiar static of Kenji’s own thoughts. As Kenji scooped coffee grounds into a filter, a deliberate, measured act he’d performed thousands of times, the Weaver’s consciousness stirred, its thought crystalline and sharp.

“The storm did not pass. The weight did not lift. I feel it as you do. Yet you move. You measure the dust. You heat the water. This is not a strategy for victory. Why do you persist in a battle that cannot be won?”

Kenji paused, his hand hovering over the kettle as it began to rumble. He looked out the window, past the balcony, at the sliver of the bay visible between two buildings. He didn’t have a grand answer. He only had the truth he lived by.

“There are hundreds of thousands or even millions of humans out there fighting their own battles,” Kenji thought, the words flowing calmly into the shared space of his mind. “Clashing with the demons and dragons from within. The fight might look bleak, victory almost impossible, the light at the end of the tunnel might just be another train coming, but as long as you’re alive; breathe.”

The kettle clicked off. He poured the hot water over the grounds in a slow, steady spiral. The rich aroma filled the small kitchen.

“Savor the moment. Be grateful in spite of your suffering. Choose kindness, always. Acknowledge when the force of chaos is too overwhelming, and use your words to articulate what is wrong.”

He leaned against the counter, waiting, feeling the Weaver’s focused attention on these concepts. It was like trying to describe color to a being that had never known light.

“Write them down, as clearly as you can. The universe will see to it that you will regain your strength to fight another day.”

The monologue finished, leaving a quiet echo. There was no reply from the Weaver. There was only the dripping of coffee into the pot and the distant sound of the city waking up.

Kenji drank his coffee, showered, and got dressed. As he gathered his keys and wallet from the small dish by the door, ready to face the day, he also picked up a small, worn notebook and a pen. He stood there for a moment, leaning against the doorframe, and wrote. It was not a long entry, just a few lines, the pen scratching decisively across the page.

The Weaver watched, fascinated. It had felt the swirling, abstract chaos of Kenji’s morning anxiety, a nebulous dread, a flicker of memory, a worry about an email. Now, it witnessed that chaos being channeled through his arm, down the pen, and imprisoned in neat, black symbols on the page.

It was not destroyed. It was not defeated. It was simply… put down. Named. Acknowledged. Caged.

For the first time, the Weaver understood. This was not a battle to be won. It was a weight to be carried, and Kenji, against all odds, was teaching it how to build a stronger back.",7,1753514237.0,u_whypotato2123,2,1.0,False

## What is Track Dexair Sys?

Track Dexair Sys is an **automated trading platform** designed to help both beginners and experienced traders make smarter moves in the cryptocurrency market. It uses algorithms and machine learning to analyze market trends and execute trades on your behalf, supposedly increasing your chances of profit.

The platform isn't limited to just crypto either. It claims to support a variety of asset types like forex, stocks, and even commodities. So if you're looking to diversify, this could be a solid tool. What makes it stand out is its **user-friendly interface**, customizable settings, and a dashboard that doesn’t require you to be a Wall Street genius to understand.

## Who Created Track Dexair Sys?

Now, here's where things get a little fuzzy. The creators of Track Dexair Sys haven’t exactly stepped into the spotlight. This is pretty common in the trading bot world, though—it’s similar to platforms like Bitcoin Code or Immediate Edge where the developers prefer to stay anonymous.

That said, based on the platform’s performance and interface, it seems like it was **built by a team with real fintech experience**. The tech feels polished, and there are signs that this wasn’t just thrown together overnight. It’s likely a group of traders and software engineers collaborated to make this happen.

## How Does Track Dexair Sys Work?

Track Dexair Sys uses a combination of **AI algorithms and real-time data analysis** to identify trading opportunities. Here’s the simple version of what happens:

- You sign up and deposit funds.
- The platform scans the markets 24/7 for profitable trades.
- When it spots a good one, it either alerts you or executes the trade automatically (depending on your settings).
- You monitor performance and adjust as needed.

What’s cool is that you can **customize your risk level**, which is great if you’re just starting out and don’t want to go full YOLO. There’s also a **demo mode** for testing before you commit real money—huge plus in my book.

## Track Dexair Sys Pros and Cons

Let’s break this down like a pro-con list you’d text your friend when deciding if you should try something new.

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Track Dexair Sys?

You can use Track Dexair Sys on pretty much any modern device with a browser. I tested it on my laptop, iPhone, and even an older Android tablet—it worked fine across the board.

- **Desktop (Windows/Mac)** – Best for full dashboard use
- **Tablet** – Good for quick monitoring
- **Smartphone (iOS/Android)** – Great for trading on-the-go

There’s no dedicated app (at least not yet), but the **web version is fully responsive**, so you won’t miss out on features if you’re mobile.

## Track Dexair Sys – Supported Countries

Track Dexair Sys is available in a **wide range of countries**, but there are some limitations due to regulatory issues. If you’re in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, or most of Europe, you should be good to go.

However, countries with stricter financial regulations (like North Korea or some Middle Eastern nations) might not have access. The best way to check? Just try signing up. If your country isn’t supported, the site will let you know right away.

## Track Dexair Sys – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is the engine behind the whole platform. The AI constantly scans markets, news, and price charts to identify patterns and trends. It’s like having a mini-Warren Buffett watching the markets 24/7—minus the Omaha charm.

### User-Friendly Interface

The dashboard is super clean, which I appreciate. You don’t need to be a finance nerd to understand what’s going on. Everything’s labeled clearly, and the learning curve is pretty much zero.

### Mobile Accessibility

Like I said earlier, you don’t need a special app. Just open it in your mobile browser and you’re good. I was checking trades while waiting in line for coffee. Pretty slick.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up alerts for specific price points or market movements. If you’re not into auto-trading, this is a great way to stay in control without being glued to a screen.

### Multiple Asset Trading

This isn’t just a crypto bot. You can trade **stocks, forex, and commodities** too. So if Bitcoin is flatlining, you can shift your focus to something else.

## Is Track Dexair Sys a Scam?

Based on my experience and what I’ve seen from other users, it doesn’t look like a scam. The platform functions well, withdrawals are processed, and there are no shady fees popping up.

Still, like with any trading tool, **there’s no guaranteed profit**. If someone promises you’ll double your money overnight, they’re full of it. Track Dexair Sys seems legit, but don’t expect miracles.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Track Dexair Sys?

The minimum deposit is **$250**, which is pretty standard for these types of platforms. It’s not pocket change, but it’s not outrageous either.

I recommend starting with the minimum, testing the demo, and then deciding if you want to scale up.

### Track Dexair Sys Customer Support

Support is available 24/7 via chat or email. I tried the chat option and got a response within 5 minutes, which is actually quicker than most platforms I’ve used.

They were helpful, not overly scripted, and explained things clearly. No complaints here.

Three years were enough for me to plan a perfect exit.    
He sneered, “Boring Omega she-wolf.”    
When the contract finally expired, he thought I would remain his loyal shadow forever.    
But he was wrong—I never intended to stay.    
In the darkness of night, I dialed that long-forgotten number: “Dad, I’ve accepted the Black Mountain pack’s marriage proposal.”  
Later, at the solemn clan ceremony, Ferris watched helplessly as I linked arms with the Black Mountain Alpha, radiant with glory.    
In that moment, the world he had meticulously built crumbled to pieces.    
He finally understood that what he had let go of was not a temporary substitute—    
but the one and only true Luna destined by fate to resonate with his soul.  
  
""I just sent you a divorce agreement. Alpha Ferris and I signed it on our wedding day three years ago. Could you check if there are any issues?""  
  
I stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, my fingers unconsciously tracing the edge of my phone.  
  
""Luna, I've reviewed the agreement. Everything looks fine.""  
  
My lawyer's professional voice came through the speaker.   
  
""There's one month left before the three-year term expires. Once it's up, the divorce will automatically take effect. You'll be free to leave the Silver Moon Pack and start fresh.""  
  
""Thank you.""  
  
I hung up and lifted my gaze to our wedding photo on the wall.  
  
In the picture, I wore a pristine white gown, smiling so wide my eyes curved like crescent moons.   
  
Beside me stood Alpha Ferris in his tailored suit—devastatingly hands0me, yet not even a hint of a smile graced his features.  
  
Love versus indifference. Crystal clear.  
  
""That day's finally coming. You must be thrilled,"" I whispered to myself, my fingertip gently tracing the cold, sharp lines of the man's face in the photo.  
  
The sound of keys jingling at the front door made me quickly pull my hand back and turn around.  
  
""I'm home.""  
  
I took Ferris's suit jacket as he shrugged it off, then squatted down to help him into his slippers.   
  
My movements flowed with practiced precision, like I'd rehearsed this routine a thousand times.  
  
Ferris loosened his tie, his expression remaining distant.   
  
""Next month's Moonlight Gala for the Silver Moon Pack—I need you there as Luna.""  
  
Thinking about that divorce agreement set to activate in one month, my hands paused while folding his jacket.  
  
I shook my head. ""I can't make it.""  
  
""Why not?"" Ferris frowned.  
  
I opened my mouth to explain, but suddenly something clicked in his mind. His eyes turned glacial.  
  
""Is this because I've been spending time with Ashley? Are you jealous?""  
  
""I told you on our wedding day—I'm in love with someone else. You said you wouldn't interfere.""  
  
My heart clenched violently, like someone had torn it wide open.  
  
Right. My mate, my Alpha, had told me on our wedding night that he already had a she-wolf he truly loved. He'd only married me to shut up the pack elders.  
  
Not only that, but on our wedding night, he'd forced me to sign an agreement to divorce after three years.  
  
Looking at Ferris's irritated expression, I managed a weak smile.  
  
He thought I was jealous. Throwing a tantrum.  
  
I am merely fulfilling his wish by leaving the Silver Moon Pack next month, so I will not be able to attend the banquet.   
  
He must be ecstatic. Soon he'd be free to marry his true love.  
  
With a bitter smile tugging at my lips, I reminded him, ""Ferris, do you remember the agreement we signed three years ago?""  
  
Three years ago, the Silver Moon Pack and Stardust pack announced their upcoming alliance through marriage.  
  
These were two of the wealthiest and most powerful packs in the werewolf world. With their heirs becoming mates, both packs would reach unprecedented heights of strength and prestige.  
  
I'd harbored a secret crush on Ferris since childhood. Learning I'd become his Luna had sent me over the moon.  
  
But on our wedding night, Ferris handed me divorce papers.  
  
""I'm in love with someone else. Her name is Ashley Carter. Since she's an omega, my father refuses to let her become my Luna.""  
  
His tone was cold, his words brutally direct. ""I need three years to become Silver Moon's true Alpha. After that, no one will dare oppose our union.""  
  
""For these three years, we'll just play the role of husband and wife. Then we divorce.""  
  
That night, I signed as he wished, then cried in the bathroom until dawn.  
  
But less than three months after our wedding, Ashley vanished without a trace after a fight with Ferris.  
  
Ferris went crazy searching for her. He pulled every string, used every connection, but found nothing.  
  
During that period, he'd stay out all night, coming home reeking of alcohol with terrifyingly dark eyes.  
  
Until one night, he stumbled home completely wasted and pinned me to the bed.  
  
His kiss crashed down on me, heavy with alcohol, but he whispered, ""Ashley... why did you leave? Why are you with someone else? Don't you trust me?""  
  
My entire body went rigid. My heart felt like someone was crushing it in their fist—the pain nearly suffocating.  
  
So... he'd found her.  
  
But Ashley was with someone else now.  
  
That night was my first time, yet Ferris held me while calling another woman's name until sunrise.  
  
The next morning, Ferris saw the blood on the sheets. His eyes flickered with something unreadable, but he said nothing.  
  
I acted like nothing had happened, preparing his fresh clothes and even gently reminding him about his important meeting before he left.  
  
I pretended everything was fine, but inside, I was bleeding out.  
  
Married for three years, secretly married for three years. The Silver Moon wolves knew their Alpha had taken a Luna, but only a select few knew her name or what she looked like.  
  
I didn't care about any of that. From then on, I became even more careful about taking care of Ferris.  
  
Ferris was always buried in pack business, frequently skipping meals. At night, his stomach would cramp with excruciating pain.  
  
So I'd wake before dawn every day, spending hours brewing medicinal herb soup.  
  
When he was exhausted, I learned massage techniques to ease his tension.  
  
He loved quiet, so I never made noise around him. I hid my naturally cheerful, sunny personality and even softened my footsteps.  
  
Gradually, Ferris seemed to accept me as his mate.  
  
He started giving me small gifts on holidays.  
  
When I fell ill, he'd personally hunt down rare herbs based on the healer's prescriptions.  
  
He'd even hold me close during the night, his palm pressed against my waist, his body heat scorching.  
  
Ferris never mentioned divorce again, as if that agreement had never existed.  
  
I was naive enough to believe that maybe, just maybe, he could learn to love me.  
  
Until three months ago, when Ashley returned to the Silver Moon Pack after her breakup.  
  
Ferris rushed back to her side almost instantly.  
  
He'd take her to dinner, go shopping with her, even cancel crucial pack meetings because Ashley mentioned feeling ""a little down.""  
  
Standing at the window, watching Ferris's car head toward Ashley's apartment yet again, I finally understood.  
  
True love is true love. No matter how much I gave, it could never compete with a single glance from Ashley.  
  
At least the three-year contract marriage was finally ending.  
  
I told myself these three years had been nothing but a dream.  
  
Now the dream was over. Time for me to leave.  
  
""The agreement from three years ago?""  
  
Ferris's voice snapped me out of my memories. I stared at him in shock, my throat tightening.  
  
He... didn't remember the divorce agreement?  
These three years, I'd been counting down every single day, terrified that the moment our contract expired, he'd leave without hesitation.  
  
Yet now, he seemed to have completely forgotten about it.  
  
I opened my mouth to remind him when Ferris's phone suddenly rang.  
  
The moment he answered, Ashley's tear-choked voice came through the speaker.  
  
I couldn't make out her words, but I watched Ferris's expression shift dramatically.  
  
""Don't be scared. I'm coming right now.""  
  
He hung up, grabbed his car keys, and bolted for the door.  
  
In his rush, his shoulder slammed hard into my body.  
  
I stumbled backward, my spine hitting the doorframe with enough force to make me gasp in pain.  
  
But Ferris never looked back. His figure had already vanished through the doorway.  
  
I steadied myself against the wall and slowly made my way back to the bedroom. When I removed my jacket, a dark bruise was already blooming across my shoulder.  
  
I retrieved the first aid kit and silently applied ointment to the injury, feeling like my heart was being carved open with a dull blade, slice by agonizing slice.  
  
I sat on the bed's edge, staring blankly at the darkening sky outside until my phone rang.  
  
Ferris.  
  
""Come to Silver Pine General Medical Center.""  
  
My heart lurched. ""What happened?""  
  
""Just get here.""  
  
When I arrived, I spotted Ferris standing outside the operating room from across the corridor. Ashley was nestled against his ch3st, crying pitifully.  
  
My steps faltered. Something clamped around my ch3st, making each breath a struggle.  
  
""What's going on?"" I approached them, keeping my voice soft.  
  
Ferris looked up at me. ""Ashley's mother has acute leukemia. She needs an immediate bone marrow transplant.""  
  
I blinked in confusion. ""And?""  
  
""We've tested everyone in Silver Moon Pack, including myself. No matches."" Ferris's tone remained flat. ""You have a donation record on file at the medical center. You're compatible.""  
  
My pupils contracted as disbelief washed over me. ""You want me to donate bone marrow?""  
  
""It's your responsibility as Luna.""  
  
Ferris closed his eyes. When he opened them again, only cold determination remained. ""Hold her down.""  
  
At his command, several warriors stepped forward and gripped my shoulders. One pulled out a syringe.  
  
""Ferris Vargan!"" I struggled desperately. ""I already donated years ago—I can't donate again! This will kill me! Let me go!""  
  
""If you do this, my father and the entire Stardust pack will never forgive you!""  
  
The warriors hesitated, their grip loosening as they looked to Ferris for guidance.  
  
""You'd tell any lie to avoid donating."" Ferris's voice turned glacial. ""Hold her. I'll take full responsibility for any consequences.""  
  
The warriors didn't dare defy their Alpha. They pinned me down as the needle pierced my skin.  
  
The anesthetic worked quickly. My consciousness began to blur, my strength fading until I couldn't fight anymore.  
  
A healer spoke quietly nearby: ""Alpha Ferris, this surgery requires a family member's signature.""  
  
Ferris took the pen and paper. ""I can sign right now.""  
  
Family member...  
  
My heart clenched violently.  
  
Right. Legally, I was still his Luna.  
  
This was the first time he'd so readily acknowledged me as his Luna.  
  
And it was only so I could donate bone marrow to Ashley's mother.  
  
How fu/cking ironic.  
  
The nurse handed over the surgical consent form. Ferris wrote his name with careful, deliberate strokes.  
  
For some inexplicable reason, his pen hesitated mid-signature, and a sharp pain shot through his ch3st.  
  
Ashley urged him gently, tears glistening in her eyes. ""Are you having second thoughts?""  
  
Ferris's gaze flickered, but he said nothing. He finished signing and watched as I was wheeled into the operating room.  
  
The moment those doors closed, my tears finally fell.  
  
So this was how deeply Ferris loved Ashley—enough to sacrifice my life for her sake.  
  
Ferris, I'm never going to love you again.  
  
The surgical lights blazed on while the corridor fell silent except for the sound of breathing.  
  
After I disappeared behind those doors, he stood at the corridor's end, staring at that cold, steel barrier for what felt like hours—like a caged wolf unable to catch his mate's scent.  
  
He tried to sit but lasted only seconds before springing back up to pace restlessly.  
  
Only when he saw me being wheeled out of surgery did he finally exhale.  
  
""How is she?""  
  
The doctor removed his mask, but his expression remained grave. ""The surgery went smoothly, but the Luna's body is... extremely weak. Recovery will be difficult. She'll need careful, constant care.""  
  
Ferris nodded. ""I'll go see her.""  
  
He'd barely taken a step toward the patient room when a hand caught his arm.  
  
Ashley.  
  
""Ferris,"" she said softly, ""the beta just came from the Werewolf Council. They need you back immediately to handle the border territory dispute. It can't wait any longer.""  
  
""I know you're worried about her, but you're the Alpha. The pack has to come first.""  
  
Ferris's throat worked as uncertainty flashed in his eyes.  
  
Ashley stepped forward, blocking his path. ""Go handle pack business. I'll stay and take care of her. I promise, when she wakes up, I'll be the first thing she sees.""  
  
Ferris nodded and left the hospital with his subordinates.  
  
I don't know how much time passed before I slowly opened my eyes after surgery.  
  
I turned my head with difficulty, my throat feeling like sandpaper. My first instinct was to search for—  
  
Ferris.  
  
But the person in my line of sight was Ashley.  
  
She smiled at me. ""You're finally awake. Thank you, Aurora. You saved my mother.""  
  
I looked up at her without speaking.  
  
Ashley wiped away tears, her voice thick with emotion. ""I really never imagined... after all these years, Ferris would still love me this deeply.""  
  
She paused, as if lost in memory.  
  
""Do you know? Last year on my birthday, he flew all the way to Paris just to bring me a necklace... It was a design I'd mentioned liking once in passing, and he actually remembered all that time.""  
  
""But I was still angry with him then. I threw the necklace right back at him and wouldn't even let him through the door.""  
  
My fingers clenched violently, nails digging deep into my palms.  
  
I remembered perfectly. Last year, Ferris had told me he was traveling to Mississippi for business negotiations with the Ghost Wolf Pack.  
  
When he returned, he'd brought back a necklace and casually given it to me.  
  
I'd been overjoyed, treasuring it in the bottom of my jewelry box—too precious to even wear.  
  
But it turned out... that was Ashley's reject, something he'd carelessly passed along to me.  
  
Ashley continued, ""And the Christmas before last, I had a huge fight with my boyfriend at the time and posted something really depressing on Instagram. When Ferris saw it, he flew over that same night and stood outside my apartment building all night long. It was snowing heavily, but he just stood there, never daring to come up and knock.""  
  
My heart twisted painfully.  
  
I remembered that Christmas night—Ferris had been unusually passionate, making love to me seven times straight until dawn.  
  
That entire night, he'd been rough and relentless in bed. Even when his harsh movements hurt me, I'd gritted my teeth and endured it.  
  
Because I thought he was finally starting to feel something for me.  
  
When I woke up the next morning, the bed beside me was already cold. I assumed he'd left to handle urgent pack business.  
  
It turned out... he'd rushed off to see Ashley.  
  
""These past three years..."" Ashley's tears fell again. ""I've been stubborn, deliberately avoiding contact with him. But Ferris never forgot me for a single day. He wrote me a letter every day, even though I never once replied.""  
  
I suddenly found it hard to breathe.  
  
How many late nights had I seen the study light on, thinking he was handling pack affairs? I'd even brewed coffee specially to bring him.  
  
It turned out... he was writing love letters to Ashley.  
  
I'd always believed that at least during Ashley's absence, Ferris genuinely wanted us to become a real married couple.  
  
Now I understood. From beginning to end, it had all been my own delusional fantasy.  
  
The heart I thought I'd finally warmed belonged entirely to someone else.  
  
Seeing Ashley about to continue, I abruptly stood up.  
  
My face was pale as paper, but I forced my voice to remain calm. ""I'm not feeling well. I need to rest.""  
  
A flash of triumph crossed Ashley's eyes. ""Of course, you just had surgery. You should rest more.""  
  
Her footsteps finally faded outside the door.  
  
I lay on the hospital bed with my eyes open, staring at the blank ceiling.  
  
After discharge, I silently packed all my belongings, waiting only for the divorce agreement's expiration.  
  
During this time, I could track Ferris's activities daily through Ashley's social media—  
  
The surgery had been successful, but he never once came to check on me. Instead, he immediately arranged the finest private room for Ashley's mother, flew in top medical teams from abroad, and personally supervised every treatment plan.  
  
Ashley's latest Instagram post was a photograph.  
  
Ferris knelt on one knee, tying her shoelaces.  
  
Her caption read: \[I'll never meet anyone who loves me this much again.\]  
  
My heart clenched violently. Tears splashed onto my phone screen, blurring the image of Ferris's tender profile.  
  
I remembered how I'd cared for him with the same devotion all these years.  
  
When his stomach troubled him, I'd brew medicinal soups daily.  
  
When work kept him busy, I'd leave the lights on waiting for his return.  
  
Every piece of fruit I brought him was peeled, cored, and cut to perfect bite-sized pieces...  
  
But now he was doing these things for someone else.  
  
I took a deep breath, wiped away my tears, and mind-linked Ferris.  
  
After a long pause, Ferris responded coldly, ""I should have told you not to interrupt when I'm working—""  
  
For the first time, I cut him off:  
  
""Ferris, let's break our bond.""

We have had a short relationship, only eight months, and I figured out two months ago that he had been cheating our entire relationship. Literally since day one. I met him through my older brother, Kyle, 29M, who was best friends with bf. He brought bf to some events and I liked him fairly quickly. We started talking and dating a month later. The relationship seemed too good to be true; sadly it was.

 The day before our six month anniversary, bf woke me up for work, made me coffee and breakfast, then droped the bomb that he had been cheating on me for the last six months. This was not a voluntary confession, it was forced by my other older brother, Allan, 30M. My bf's ex Rachel reached out to Allen and asked him if I knew because bf told her that we were in an open relationship(true) and that I knew they were sexting(untrue). Allen talked to bf and realized I had no clue. He told bf he had 24hrs to tell me or he would. 

I tried very hard to forgive him as we were in an open relationship and it was never a physical relationship, just sexting, pictures, calls, etc. The problem was one of the boundaries for our open relationship was that he tell me about potential sexual partners before anything happened. I read their text thread, he hid it on discord so I couldn't find it and tried deleting all texts, messages, and discord messages, but discord saved the data and I found them. It was horrible. It made me feel ugly, fat, and unwanted. He called me ""you know who"" like Voldemort or something and kept asking for pictures telling her she was more sexy than me, had bigger boobs, was skinnier, and other stuff. 

I tried to give him another chance, asked for space, tried to mourn our old relationship and build a new one, but I couldn't. I couldn't find it in me to forgive him. He hates the thought of leaving for a couple days to give me space because ""I'm afraid you'll leave while I'm gone"" even though we were both living in MY grandparents attic room. My family hated him after they found out and wanted me to dump him, but I still feel like an asshole for breaking up after promising him a second chance. So reddit, AITA. (P.S. I am probably making it sound worse than it was, but this is my biased side of the story)",1,1753513455.0,AITAH,5,0.67,False

Husband saw weird location for me on his phone today and assumed I was with another man.,"Today started like any normal day for me. I got up took care of the dogs, had coffee, got a workout in and started to get ready for my afternoon shift. I tend to lose track of time easily and end up rushing to get ready for work. To avoid distraction, sometimes I don’t have my phone near me and I keep it in a separate room so I’m not tempted to fuck around on it while I’m trying to get ready. Today was a day I was running behind and I didn’t check my phone for an hour and a half to two hours while I was getting ready. Finally, before leaving for work I replied to a few texts, including one to my husband saying I was running behind and see you later and have a good afternoon. I can immediately tell in his responses that something is off.  There’s very little communication and when there is, it’s not normal, so I ask if he’s good and he says yes and gives me an excuse about the dog. I said OK I’m sorry that sucks. I hope your afternoon gets better. I get a few more texts while I’m at work and they’re still not normal. When I get home, I ask, are you good? Yeah, I’m good. We converse some more for a little while, and I can tell something is still wrong and I ask again, are you good? Yeah, I’m OK.
Finally after being home from work for a couple of hours, he says he wants to ask me something about where I was earlier today. He proceeds to show me a screenshot of me at a location that I was not at today. I tell him I have no idea why it would show me at that location because I literally was at home and at work today. And then I asked him what time that was and he said it was before I went to work so then I asked him why didn’t you call, text or FaceTime me and ask if I’m good? Because that would’ve been what I would’ve done. Then he said he checked the camera and he didn’t see me, but he saw the dog sitting on the couch looking toward the front door. Again, why would he not just call me if concerned like he said or if he wanted see if I’m actually home? Instead, he chose to stew on it all day for like seven hours before he said anything to me. He said when he saw that on his phone his heart immediately sunk and like went into his throat. I’m sorry, so you see me at a location and don’t think it could possibly be a glitch, but your thoughts automatically go to me doing something I’m not supposed to be doing? And instead of right then and there checking on my “well-being” to actually make sure I’m OK and make sure I’m at home safe, he just screenshots “proof” to show me that after he asked me where I’ve been today because his phone showed that location and stayed there for a bit. I completely understand being upset or confused seeing that and being like what the fuck?!?! What I’m upset about is the fact that instead of asking me right then and there when he saw it, well before I had to be at work and I was still at home and he knew I would have still been at home, he chose to screenshot it and not say anything. He chose to not address it for seven hours after I asked multiple times through text and in person if he was OK. Then he tells me he was so upset and he was so scared and that’s why he couldn’t finish his dinner because my location said I was at some random house for I don’t even know how long because he didn’t specify that detail. He also said he googled if the location could be wrong and it said it could be so that made him feel better. That upset me so hard and showed me that he doesn’t trust me, and I have never given this man a reason to not trust me. Also both in our 40s and have been married for 10+ years.

I hope your afternoon gets better. I get a few more texts while I’m at work and they’re still not normal. When I get home, I ask, are you good? Yeah, I’m good. We converse some more for a little while, and I can tell something is still wrong and I ask again, are you good? Yeah, I’m OK.  
Finally after being home from work for a couple of hours, he says he wants to ask me something about where I was earlier today. He proceeds to show me a screenshot of me at a location that I was not at today. I tell him I have no idea why it would show me at that location because I literally was at home and at work today. And then I asked him what time that was and he said it was before I went to work so then I asked him why didn’t you call, text or FaceTime me and ask if I’m good? Because that would’ve been what I would’ve done. Then he said he checked the camera and he didn’t see me, but he saw the dog sitting on the couch looking toward the front door. 
Again, why would he not just call me if concerned like he said or if he wanted see if I’m actually home? Instead, he chose to stew on it all day for like seven hours before he said anything to me. He said when he saw that on his phone his heart immediately sunk and like went into his throat. I’m sorry, so you see me at a location and don’t think it could possibly be a glitch, but your thoughts automatically go to me doing something I’m not supposed to be doing? And instead of right then and there checking on my “well-being” to actually make sure I’m OK and make sure I’m at home safe, he just screenshots “proof” to show me that after he asked me where I’ve been today because his phone showed that location and stayed there for a bit. 
I completely understand being upset or confused seeing that and being like what the fuck?!?! What I’m upset about is the fact that instead of asking me right then and there when he saw it, well before I had to be at work and I was still at home and he knew I would have still been at home, he chose to screenshot it and not say anything. He chose to not address it for seven hours after I asked multiple times through text and in person if he was OK. Then he tells me he was so upset and he was so scared and that’s why he couldn’t finish his dinner because my location said I was at some random house for I don’t even know how long because he didn’t specify that detail. He also said he googled if the location could be wrong and it said it could be so that made him feel better. That upset me so hard and showed me that he doesn’t trust me, and I have never given this man a reason to not trust me. Also both in our 40s and have been married for 10+ years.

**The problem I was solving:** Everyone's fighting over saturated YouTube/ instagram niches while completely ignoring what people are actually desperate to find content about.

**Tech stack:**

* Python + BeautifulSoup for scraping
* Pandas for data analysis
* Custom sentiment analysis pipeline with LLM
* Engagement ratio algorithms

**The process that nearly killed me:**

* 30 hours straight scraping (lived on coffee and spite)
* Pulled every top post from 147 major subreddits
* Analyzed 10K+ upvote posts for peak interest topics
* Built engagement ratio formulas (comments/upvotes) to find discussion-heavy areas
* Created demand/supply matrices for content opportunities

**What I discovered was mind-blowing:**

Found micro-niches where people post the SAME problems daily but zero content exists about them. We're talking about specific workflows, tools, and solutions that communities are begging for but no creators are addressing.

**Example findings:**

* Niche A: 15K monthly searches, 0 competitors, daily Reddit discussions
* Niche B: 8K engaged community members, posting same questions weekly, no YouTube solutions
* Niche C: 50K+ people manually doing tasks that could be automated, zero tutorial content

**The technical challenge:** Building scrapers that could handle Reddit's rate limiting while maintaining data integrity across different subreddit structures. Had to create custom parsers for each community's posting patterns.

**Current status:** Testing one micro-niche myself as proof of concept. Early results are promising - found exactly what the data predicted.

**What I learned:** There's a massive disconnect between what content creators think people want vs. what communities are actually discussing every day. The data doesn't lie.

Anyone else ever built something that completely changed how you see market opportunities? This project made me realize how much untapped demand is hiding in plain sight.

I mean, I don't really have any big life decisions looing or a dramatic romabce saga playing out, but it's more like a constant low-key buzz of 'what even is going on?' I've heeard people say that it's kinda common to feel adrift in your 20s but is this just something everyone else grows out of?

Today I actually fogot my moring coffee (I know, tragic mistake), and endured an awkward run-in with an ex at the grocery stroe. Not a fun combo. It's these little things that add up, ya know? Maybe I'm ovetrhinking it, like, really diving into the 'why,' which is probably its own rabbit hole.

So, here I am, tossing this out into the void, hooing it resonates with someone. How do you deal with these waves of confusion? Maybe you've got some advice or even your own story? I'd love to hear it.

Ever felt like you’re constantly missing out on the next big crypto wave? Like by the time you hear about it, it’s already too late to jump in? Yeah, same here. That’s why I’ve been on the hunt for smarter, faster, and more intuitive trading tools—and that’s how I stumbled upon the **[Sovamnex App](https://tinyurl.com/29slsttn)**.

There’s a lot of buzz going around right now about trading platforms that claim to automate your trades or give you that edge over the market—think tools like *Bitcoin Era* or *Immediate Edge*. Sovamnex is the latest one making waves, especially among new and mid-level traders who want results without being glued to a screen 24/7.

In this review, I’m breaking down everything you need to know about Sovamnex—how it works, who’s behind it, its features, pros and cons, and whether it’s actually worth your time and investment. No fluff, just real talk from someone who’s been in the trenches. Let’s get into it.

## What is Sovamnex App?

Sovamnex App is essentially a **trading platform** designed to simplify how people interact with financial markets. It combines **manual control** with **automated trading features**, giving users the flexibility to either trade on their own or let the system do its thing using real-time data analysis.

What makes it stand out is its intent to bridge the gap between **complete beginners** and **seasoned traders**. You don’t need to be a Wall Street genius to use it. The interface is clean, the learning curve is low, and the features are genuinely helpful. It feels like someone actually thought, “Hey, what would I want if I were just starting out?”

## Who Created Sovamnex App?

This is where things get a *bit* murky. Like many trading platforms in this space, Sovamnex doesn’t have a well-known founder attached to it. There’s no “Steve Jobs of Sovamnex” giving keynote speeches. But according to several sources and user feedback, it appears to be the product of a **team of developers and financial analysts**, likely the same crew behind platforms like Bitcoin Era or Immediate Edge.

While anonymity might raise some eyebrows, it’s not uncommon in the crypto space. As long as the platform is **transparent in operations**, **secure**, and **delivers results**, I’m not too hung up on the lacking celebrity CEO.

## How Does Sovamnex App Work?

Sovamnex App uses **AI-driven algorithms and real-time market analysis** to help identify potential trade opportunities. It’s kind of like having a mini Wall Street analyst on your phone—minus the $300K salary.

Here’s what happens under the hood:

- It scans market trends and historical data.
- Uses predictive modeling to estimate profitable trades.
- Sends alerts or executes trades automatically (if you enable auto-trading).
- Offers manual trading features for those who want full control.

The app works through a **web-based platform**, so there’s no need to download anything. Just log in, fund your account, and you’re good to go.

## Sovamnex App Pros and Cons

Let’s break it down, good and bad:

**Pros:**

- ✅ Easy to use, even for total newbies
- ✅ Supports multiple asset classes (crypto, forex, stocks)
- ✅ Real-time data and alerts
- ✅ Offers both auto and manual trading
- ✅ Low minimum deposit ($250)
- ✅ Responsive 24/7 support

**Cons:**

- ❌ No mobile app (browser-only access)
- ❌ Limited information about the development team
- ❌ Platform can be overwhelming with too many features at first
- ❌ Not available in all countries

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Sovamnex App?

Sovamnex App is **entirely web-based**, so you can access it from **any device with a browser**—laptop, desktop, tablet, or smartphone. I’ve used it on both iOS and Android without any hiccups. It’s responsive and smooth, although I do wish they had a dedicated app for better push notifications and a more native feel.

So yeah, it’s not picky. If your device can browse Reddit, it can run Sovamnex.

## Sovamnex App – Supported Countries

Sovamnex is available in most countries, especially across **Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa**. That said, it’s *not* available in restricted territories like:

- United States
- North Korea
- Iran
- Some parts of Canada

If you’re unsure, their support team is pretty quick to confirm whether your region is supported. It’s always good to check before signing up.

## Sovamnex App – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The app continuously scans markets using **AI-powered algorithms**, giving updates and suggestions based on real-time data. This helps users make more informed decisions instead of guessing or relying on outdated info.

### User-Friendly Interface

Even if you’ve never traded before, the dashboard is intuitive. Everything is clearly labeled, and the learning curve is surprisingly gentle. It doesn’t bombard you with jargon or complex charts unless you want to dive deep.

### Mobile Accessibility

Though it’s not a native app, the web-based version works flawlessly on mobile browsers. I’ve placed trades on the go while sipping coffee—no lag, no crashes.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up alerts for specific price movements, asset changes, or trade conditions. This is super useful if you want the app to notify you but not necessarily make trades without your input.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Sovamnex supports **cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks, and commodities**. This means you can diversify your portfolio without hopping between platforms.

## Is Sovamnex App a Scam?

Short answer: **No, it doesn’t appear to be**.

It’s important to be skeptical—especially in crypto—but Sovamnex checks several boxes:

- Encrypted and secure site
- Verified brokers for fund management
- Clear terms and conditions
- Transparent pricing with no hidden fees

That said, always trade with caution. No app can guarantee profits, and there’s always risk involved in trading. Sovamnex seems to do a good job providing tools to manage that risk, but don’t expect magic.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Sovamnex App?

You’ll need a **minimum of $250 USD** to get started. This is pretty standard for platforms in this category. That deposit isn’t a fee—it’s your trading capital. You can use it to fund trades or withdraw it later.

### Sovamnex App Customer Support

Support is available **24/7 via live chat and email**. I tested it twice—once during setup and once with a dummy question about withdrawals. Both times, I got a helpful response within 10 minutes.

They also offer educational resources and FAQs, which are solid for beginners.

## How do you start trading on Sovamnex App?

Getting started is pretty straightforward. Took me under 15 minutes.

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head to the official Sovamnex site and fill out the sign-up form. Just basic info—name, email, and phone. You’ll get a confirmation email right after.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once registered, you’ll need to verify your identity (standard KYC stuff). Then you can deposit your $250 via credit/debit card, wire transfer, or sometimes crypto.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Now the fun begins. You can either activate the **automated trading bot** or use the data and trade manually. I suggest starting with the demo account to get a feel for the platform before going live.

## How to Delete a Sovamnex App Account?

If you want out, just contact their support through email or live chat. They’ll guide you through the account deletion process. Make sure to withdraw your funds first, though—it’s common sense, but worth mentioning.

## The Verdict

Sovamnex App is a solid entry point for anyone looking to explore crypto and financial trading without getting overwhelmed. It doesn’t promise overnight millions (thankfully), but it does offer tools that can genuinely help you trade smarter.

No app is flawless—Sovamnex could benefit from a proper mobile app and more transparency about its team—but overall, it’s reliable, easy to use, and offers real value.

If you’re new to trading or want to automate part of your strategy, **Sovamnex is worth checking out**.

Funny thiing is, I totally forgot about their existence! Does this happen to anyone else? The moemnt you decide to put something important in a spot that seems secure, it's like it gets swallowed by the universe. I seriously thoought I lost my favorite ring for months, and guess where it was? Yup, put it 'somewhere safe'. It's like a black hole specifically for valuable stuff, but you totally can't see it until you're 3 cups of coffee in and mid-cleaning spree.

They say the camera never lies—but I say it flirts, teases, and sometimes tells just the right kind of fib. I’m the guy behind the lens, chasing beauty in all its messy, unexpected glory. I live for those in-between moments—the smirk before the laugh, the glance that says everything, the kind of light that makes skin glow like it’s telling secrets.

Outside the frame? I’m your classic Irish rogue—tattooed, music loud enough to shake the walls, book in hand (probably with a half-drunk coffee beside it), and always up for an adventure, especially the kind that starts with “I probably shouldn’t…” and ends with a story worth retelling.

I crave deep convos, cheeky chemistry, and the kind of connection that makes the world fade out like the end of a good film. If you’re a fellow dreamer, night owl, or someone who knows there’s beauty in being truly seen—then maybe we’re overdue for a little spark of something.

(link is in the below)

**The problem I was solving:** Everyone's fighting over saturated instagram niches while completely ignoring what people are actually desperate to find content about.

**Tech stack:**

* Python + BeautifulSoup for scraping
* Pandas for data analysis
* Custom sentiment analysis pipeline with LLM
* Engagement ratio algorithms

**The process that nearly killed me:**

* 30 hours straight scraping (lived on coffee and spite)
* Pulled every top post from 147 major subreddits
* Analyzed 10K+ upvote posts for peak interest topics
* Built engagement ratio formulas (comments/upvotes) to find discussion-heavy areas
* Created demand/supply matrices for content opportunities

**What I discovered was mind-blowing:**

Found micro-niches where people post the SAME problems daily but zero content exists about them. We're talking about specific workflows, tools, and solutions that communities are begging for but no creators are addressing.

**Example findings:**

* Niche A: 15K monthly searches, 0 competitors, daily Reddit discussions
* Niche B: 8K engaged community members, posting same questions weekly, no YouTube solutions
* Niche C: 50K+ people manually doing tasks that could be automated, zero tutorial content

**The technical challenge:** Building scrapers that could handle Reddit's rate limiting while maintaining data integrity across different subreddit structures. Had to create custom parsers for each community's posting patterns.

**Current status:** Testing one micro-niche myself as proof of concept. Early results are promising - found exactly what the data predicted.

**What I learned:** There's a massive disconnect between what content creators think people want vs. what communities are actually discussing every day. The data doesn't lie.

Anyone else ever built something that completely changed how you see market opportunities? This project made me realize how much untapped demand is hiding in plain sight.

Chapter 1

I was halfway through my shower when the doorbell rang.



I ignored it, but it rang again.



Dripping wet, I stepped out of the bathroom and opened the door. A girl was standing outside.



“I’m Evelyn, your new neighbor. I left something at your place. Would it be okay if I came in to grab it?”



I stared as Evelyn brushed past me without waiting for a reply. She headed straight into my bedroom, picked up a pair of lacy panties from the bedside table, and turned back with a flushed face.



“There was a water outage in my building yesterday,” she explained. “I really had no choice but to come here and use your bathroom. I hope you don’t mind.”



She walked off with her underwear, leaving me dazed as I slumped back onto the couch.



After a long while, I tried to stand, only to feel something strange beneath me. When I looked down, I realized it was an unwrapped, used condom.



......



A wave of nausea hit me hard.



I couldn’t hold it in—I bolted to the bathroom and threw up until the room spun. Even when Robert Brown came home, he didn’t notice anything was wrong. It wasn’t until he came to the bathroom, towel in hand, and asked, “Harper, are you not feeling well?”



His eyes were full of concern. It didn’t seem fake. He helped me up gently, one hand on my shoulder, and asked again,



“What is ailing you?”



“Do you want me to take you to the hospital?”



I looked at Robert, whose face gave nothing away. Still, I couldn’t shake the unease in my chest. Maybe I was just overthinking it. A pair of panties, a used condom—maybe they didn’t mean anything.



Maybe...



It was just a misunderstanding.



Maybe...



I was being too suspicious.



My eyes were red. Robert helped me back to the sofa and handed me a cup of warm water. I shook my head.



“I’m fine. Maybe I caught a chill last night.”



Robert and I had grown up together. We’d been best friends since childhood.



I shouldn’t be doubting twenty-five years of our relationship. I shouldn’t tear down the wall of trust we’d built over one strange incident.



I calmed myself down and smiled at him. “Really, I’m fine. Don’t worry.”



Our wedding was just around the corner.



No one wanted drama right before their big day. Robert gently patted my head and said,



“I’ll go make you some food.”



I smiled and nodded, watching him walk into the kitchen. His presence felt warm and comforting. The aroma of rice drifted over as I scrolled through TikTok on the couch.



Then the doorbell rang again.



“Harper, can you get the door?” Robert called out. “My hands are full.”



He was in the middle of wrestling a lobster. Laughing, I got up from the couch and walked over to open the door.



Standing there was Evelyn Green.



She scratched her head. “I didn’t make dinner tonight. Mind if I crash yours?”



The apartment across the hall had been vacant for two years.



I had no idea someone had moved in, let alone that Evelyn could act so familiar so soon. The words to turn her down were already on the tip of my tongue when she hooked her arm around mine and raised the latte in her other hand.



“I brought coffee! No fun eating alone when we could enjoy it together. Don’t worry, I promise I’ll take out the trash afterward!”



Evelyn didn’t give me a chance to refuse. She dragged me inside.



Just then, Robert walked out of the kitchen carrying a plate of pasta. Smiling, he asked,



“Who was it?”



His expression froze when he saw Evelyn.



“Hey Robert!” Evelyn said playfully. “I came over for dinner. Your fiancée invited me. You don’t mind, do you?”



Robert’s gaze shifted to me.



I didn’t hesitate to call her out. “I didn’t say she could come.”



I pulled my arm out of Evelyn’s grip and pointed at the latte. “Looks like you’ve been doing just fine when I wasn’t home.”



I’d never been one to swallow my anger.



I didn’t believe Robert couldn’t see through Evelyn’s intentions. Maybe he was waiting for me to give him a way out—waiting for me to say, Yes, I invited Evelyn to dinner.



But I wouldn’t. I couldn’t. I didn’t want to.



I just stared straight at Robert.



Waiting for him to say something.



Chapter 2

Just like when we were kids—whenever someone tried to come between us—Robert would always say,



“The world is big, but Harper Scott is the biggest part of mine. Of course I choose her.”



I looked at Robert, then at Evelyn. Her eyes suddenly filled with tears. She slammed the latte onto the table and snapped,



“I didn’t mean anything by it! There was a power and water outage at my place yesterday, so I came to your apartment to use the shower. Today, I just wanted to say thank you and brought a coffee to ease the tension.”



Tears streamed down her face.



“Was it really necessary to treat me like this?”



Still, I said nothing. I just kept my eyes on Robert.



He rubbed his temples, and just like every time before, walked to the table, picked up the latte, and handed it back to Evelyn.



“My girlfriend doesn’t tolerate anything that makes her uncomfortable. It was my mistake for letting you in yesterday.”



“You should go.”



Evelyn burst into louder sobs. “Nothing happened between us! Why should I be slandered like this?”



She made it sound like I was the one in the wrong.



But the condom on the couch and the red hair I’d picked up looked exactly like hers. I didn’t know when Robert—who usually avoided strangers—had become so generous, letting a woman he barely knew not only enter his home but also his bathroom. Such a private space.



A man and a woman, alone.



Who knew what could have happened?



Evelyn looked at me through her tears.



“I was just trying to be kind. But your mind is so dirty that everything you see looks filthy! I just moved here, and I didn’t want to start off on the wrong foot, but you’re really going too far!”



Logically speaking, since Robert had already asked her to leave, if she had any dignity, she would’ve walked away. But she just stood there, clearly performing for someone.



I looked at her, unmoved by her guilt-tripping.



“Then let’s say I went too far.”



I opened the front door.



“Please leave.”



This time, Evelyn had no excuse. She stomped her foot and ran out in tears.



The living room fell silent.



Robert looked at me like he had no words.



“Harper, don’t you think you overreacted?”



Robert and I had been together since we were toddlers. That year when love burned brightest, Robert pulled out all the stops – getting both families, every classmate and even teachers involved – all to win me to be his girlfriend on SAT results day.



He rented fireworks across the entire city.



He said that love should start with a sense of ceremony.



And he’d asked me seriously, “Harper, will you be my girlfriend? A relationship that ends in marriage and growing old together?”



I remembered how his hands had trembled when he asked, and I’d thrown myself into his arms in tears.



Everyone had always envied me for having a childhood sweetheart like him.



And now, for a girl who’d only just moved in next door, he was saying to me—



“You know how important a girl’s reputation is. What you said just now could get her labeled a homewrecker!”



“Harper,” Robert said, brushing past me. His shoulder hit mine, forcing me back a few steps. Then he added, “I only said that to save face for you. That doesn’t mean I think you were right.”



And with that, he stormed out the door.



Only the lingering aroma of food remained in the living room. I looked at the steaming plate of pasta and felt my eyes sting with heat.



Had I been wrong?



Was I really wrong?



I spiraled into a haze of self-doubt and reflection, wondering if I’d truly crossed the line—when a new friend request popped up on Instagram.



Chapter 3

My heart skipped a beat as I watched a stranger send me several videos.



In the footage, Robert was sitting on the couch with Evelyn, lighting candles. His voice was so soft it practically dripped with love.



“Happy Valentine’s Day, baby.”



They kissed passionately.



They did everything two people could do in the most intimate way possible—right in my house.



They thrashed around in my bathtub. Water splashed over the sides as if dragging my heart along with it, tearing long, raw wounds that bled invisibly. I listened to Evelyn’s carefree laughter as she and Robert formed a heart shape with their hands in front of the camera.



“Today is our first Valentine’s Day,” she said. “We’ll have so many more to come!”



I watched this girl document her love story with Robert. She smiled and asked him, “Will me living next door bother you?”



Robert, eyes hazy from alcohol, pulled her into his arms.



“Not at all.”



“Harper and I grew up together. She’d never suspect a thing.”



“I chose you. I’ll protect you.”



The video then cut to the present.



The girl was now crying as Robert held her, comforting her. “Harper’s just hot-tempered. She only snapped because she cares too much about me. Don’t take it personally, okay?”



“I promise you—I won’t touch Harper again.”



“I’ll stay faithful to you.”



The girl sobbed into his chest. Her voice shook. “But she knew the moment she saw me. I was just standing there, and she hated me.”



“She just hated me. I wasn’t trying to do anything bad. I only wanted to see you.”



“What did I do to deserve this kind of treatment?”



In the video, Robert looked down at her with so much tenderness as he reassured her. “Don’t worry. I’ll stay with you these next few days.”



The video ended abruptly.



Then another message came through: \[Harper, do you think your wedding’s still going to happen on schedule?\]



My fingers went numb.



The tremble spread from my hands to my entire body—even my teeth were chattering. The love I had once been so proud of, the man I had trusted completely, had revealed the truth to me in the most brutal way.



I forced myself to breathe, clinging to reason through the wave of devastation. After pulling myself together, I saved all the evidence and forwarded it to Emily Clark.



\[It’s over between me and Robert.\]



When I was sixteen, I caught my father cheating on my third aunt. I confronted him through my tears, asking why he would do something like that.



Instead of remorse, my father threatened me—not to tell my mother. He was so sure that if she found out, she’d fall apart.



I didn’t believe him.



I told her anyway, sobbing as I confessed that Dad had betrayed us.



And then... my mother jumped off a building.



I never saw her again.



That summer, I lost both my parents. I was placed in a relative’s care as an unwanted guest. It was Robert who stayed by my side. It was Robert who had promised me, “Harper, even if you lose everything, you’ll still have me.”



But now—



Robert...



I no longer had him either.



I sat in a café, frozen, while Emily slammed the phone down after watching the videos. She pointed at the girl on the screen and cursed, “That bitch isn’t even pretty! How the hell did she get Robert’s attention? Back in school, even the campus queen couldn’t get a second look from him. What changed?”



Emily grew more furious with every word. She slammed her palm on the table.



“I’m going to find Robert right now!”



“Screw this!”



“That mistress had the nerve to show up at your door? There’s no way in hell we’re just letting this slide!”



Chapter 4

Emily was so furious she immediately dialed Robert’s number.



Just like always.



Every time Robert and I fought or went through a rough patch, Emily would step in to defend me. And Robert had always taken the scolding without complaint.



But this time, it took until the tenth call for Robert to finally pick up.



“Harper, I know you’re listening.”



His cold voice came through the speaker.



“Why do you always bring a third person into our problems? Do you really think that helps?”



“Can’t you grow up a little?” he said, completely devoid of empathy. “You’re only making things worse between us.”



“Harper, don’t make me regret choosing to marry you.”



Then he hung up.



Emily was livid. “That bastard! Say that to my face if you’ve got the guts!”



Then she realized—Robert had blocked her.



Fuming, she grabbed my arm and insisted on dragging me over to catch him in the act. But all I could think about was how our wedding was scheduled for next week—a wedding I had spent nearly two years planning. Every centerpiece, every table setting had been carefully chosen by me.



Now...



I let out a bitter laugh.



Suddenly, I understood what my father had meant back then: “Harper, don’t go telling your mother. You’ll only end up hurting her.”



His voice overlapped with Robert’s in my mind.



“Don’t make me regret marrying your mom.”



“What man doesn’t make mistakes? Life gets dull. Who wants to live in monotony forever?” My father’s expression, his voice, even his tone—mirrored Robert’s perfectly. “A life without any waves isn’t the life I want.”



“Emily.”



Something inside me let go.



I grabbed my things and stood up, turning to her.



“I figured it out.”



“You figured what out?”



The knot in my heart slowly dissolved. I finally felt lighter.



I smiled at Emily.



“I figured out the path forward.”



“Maybe I really shouldn’t have tied my whole life to love.” I laughed as tears slipped from my eyes. “There’s someone I should’ve loved more than anyone else—myself.”



“But before my mom died, she told me something.”



“She said, Harper, if someone hits you, hit back harder. If someone wrongs you, make sure they pay. Never let yourself be beneath anyone. Never accept any injustice. Live not just for yourself, but for the both of us.”



I looked at Emily, her eyes shimmering with tears.



I told her, “It’s Robert who betrayed me. Robert who emotionally manipulated me. So why should I pay for his mistakes?”



I’d never been the gentle type.



It was my mother’s death that had forced me to become tough yet fragile, and it was Robert who had wrapped me in that soft shell of trust—only to be the one to shatter it himself.



The night before our wedding.



Robert called and said, “Harper, I’ll pick you up tomorrow. Don’t make a scene anymore, okay?”



“Understood?”



The commanding tone in his voice made me want to laugh.



I’d already cleared out everything from our house. He probably hadn’t even been back—he hadn’t noticed a thing.



I didn’t reply.



Robert continued, “We’re getting married. You can’t keep acting like a child.”



Then I heard a girl’s voice in the background, teasing and sweet, calling his name.



It was unmistakably Evelyn.



Robert quickly added, “I’ve got something to take care of. I’ll talk to you later.”



On the day of the wedding.



Robert stood at the altar, his eyes full of affection as he watched the bride in the veil walk toward him. He smiled as he gently took her hand, tenderness in every movement—as if nothing had changed.



But just as he grasped her hand—



The lights inside the venue suddenly went out.



When they flicked back on, the room erupted.



A massive screen lit up, playing video after video of Robert and Evelyn’s intimate moments.



“Wait—this isn’t the bride, is it? Who the hell is that?!”



“Is that the mistress?!”

As the title says, I scored a date. I’m really excited about it! We’ve been vibing really well! Funny enough, we didn’t meet on a dating app, I actually met her through a post on my local subreddit for my city. I had no idea what she looked like and honestly didn’t care. Her personality is absolutely gorgeous.  (Yes, I know what she looks like now)

I should also note that it’s been awhile since I have dated!

I won’t get into the details about our conversations, but it’s clear we are both looking forward to meeting each other in person. We’re going to get some coffee and then go ice skating. I’m a decent skater, but she’s not too familiar with it. My focus would be making sure she has an enjoyable time skating.

I’ve had some friends tell me to focus on getting to know her and making sure she feels safe with me. A couple of them also suggested opening with a compliment and maybe a friendly hug to set a good tone as soon as I meet her. That way, I could give her another hug later or possibly initiate hand holding. If the date goes well, I would like to build up to giving her a kiss on the cheek to end off the date.

I’d love to hear what others think I should do. Is there anything I should keep in mind? Anything you’ve done to make a date go smoothly?",2,1753511988.0,dating_advice,1,0.67,False

Aren't enough for the darkness to blot out

With stars that stare numbly in the sky

When all that ache reflects in the lines of your face


Dark pools of sadness that somehow manage


To keep puppeting smiles and practiced ringing laughter


How will it feel to ride out on that white horse


Through the forest on your last night?

Will the snow muffle all sound, a last reprieve before the end?

1m9mfe3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenIndia/comments/1m9mfe3/you_still_haunt_my_quiet_nights/,You still haunt my quiet nights,"Rahul a 23 year old working in a corporate office. Every day, his life followed the same 
routine: he’d wake up to his alarm at 7 AM, head to work at 9 AM, and return home by 6 
PM. He felt tired of this monotonous life.
But on a cloudy Saturday morning, March 12, 2018, everything changed.
As usual , Rahul was heading to work. He took the metro, just like every other day. When 
he entered through the metro gate, he noticed the usual crowd. He walked in and stood 
near the door, holding onto the metal rod for support.
But that’s when he saw HER. To his right, in a corner seat, sat a girl who immediately 
caught his eye…..
< She wore a blue kurti with delicate sparkles shimmering around her neck. Her round 
silver Jhumkas swayed gently as the train moved. A small black bindi adorned her 
forehead, and her eyes were lined with kajal. Her long eyelashes seemed to fall softly 
into her eyes, as if each lash was dipped in moonlight and silence. 
Her left hand rested on her cheek, while her right hand held her phone. She was 
looking at her phone and smiling softly, earphones tucked into her ears. A few strands 
of hair had fallen across her cheek from the left side, as if the universe had paused for 
a moment to admire her too. 
She had a kind smile that instantly caught his attention. Her eyes sparkled, and her 
whole presence was captivating. Rahul couldn’t stop thinking about her.
That evening, Rahul went home, but his mind hadn’t left the metro. He was still lost in 
thoughts of the girl-her smile, her eyes, the way her hair gently framed her face.
Later that night, he lay on his bed, hands folded behind his head, staring at the slow-
moving fan above. Her face kept replaying in his mind like a memory that refused to fade. 
It was as if she had unknowingly taken up residence in his thoughts, and no matter how 
hard he tried, he couldn’t stop thinking about her.
With a quiet sigh, he picked up his phone and set the alarm for the next morning. His eyes lingered 
on the screen for a moment longer than usual. Then he locked it, rolled over, and closed his eyes-
hoping, maybe, she'd show up in his dreams too.
The next morning, Rahul woke up before his alarm. He just lay there for a while, 
staring at the ceiling, her face still fresh in his mind. The girl from the metro…
her smile, her eyes, the way she looked so effortlessly beautiful…her thoughts were 
still roaming around in his head.
As he got ready and left for work, a quiet hope tugged at him. Maybe he’d see her again 
on the same metro. Maybe she’d be sitting in that same corner, lost in her phone, 
smiling softly to herself.
But it didn’t happen.
The train came. The doors opened. The same rush of people, the same silence. But not 
her.
Rahul reached the office, trying to shake off the disappointment. Another day, another 
file, another coffee-same story.
But that’s when something unexpected happened.
As he walked into the office lobby, he froze for a moment. There she was. The girl from 
the metro.
Standing near the reception desk, talking to HR.
He couldn’t believe it.
She was wearing a formal pastel kurta and had her hair tied in a neat ponytail. Her name 
was Ruhi-and she wasn’t just visiting. She was the new manager.From that day on, 
getting up for work was no longer a chore for Rahul-he was eager to see her.
That day, for a new business project, Ruhi-the manager of his department-introduced 
herself to the team. But Rahul wasn’t really listening. His eyes were on her, and 
everything else faded into the background. At one point, Ruhi looked at him, smiled, and 
asked something about the project. Rahul blinked, slightly caught off guard, and fumbled 
to respond. His voice was low, almost nervous, but she nodded and smiled again—and 
in that moment, something shifted inside him.
From that day on, they began talking. A few words at first. Then longer conversations 
over coffee. Slowly, without even realizing it, she became a part of his day. Though he 
wanted to confess his feelings, he was scared she might reject him and ruin their 
friendship.
“thumari har lafzon se mujhe mohabbat ho jaye, 
kyun thumari aakhon ki naami mujhe sataye. 
jane kab rab hamre ishq ko samjhe, 
hum ek dusre ke pyar ki duniya me kho jaye. 
bhul kar bhi bhul na paunga tujhe, 
apni dil ki baat bolna chahta hu tujhe. 
har pal, zahein mein thumari hi soorat rehti hai, 
ab to raat ke sapne bhi nashe se lagti hain” 
It had been 3 months. They had become good friends-the kind who waited for each 
other at lunch, who shared smiles across busy office desks, who laughed over coffee 
like there was nothing else in the world.
But life, as always, had its own plans.
“Har mohabbat mein ek mod zaroor aata hai… 
Jab khushi ke beech dard chhup kar baith jaata hai.” 
There is no love story without a little heartbreak.
One day, the company hit a major sales milestone, so our Head of Department decided 
to throw a celebration for everyone.During the party, he introduced a new guy-Hardik.
He’d just come in from the US, joining for six months as the new Marketing Head.
Tall, broad-shouldered, with a sharp jawline, a deep voice, and the kind of confidence 
that turned every head in the room.
And yes… he had that presence.People couldn’t stop looking at him.
Rahul was standing quietly… and just beside him, Ruhi-draped in a beautiful traditional 
saree, her hair neatly tied up, a soft bindi on her forehead-looked absolutely 
breathtaking.But her eyes weren’t on Rahul.
They were on Hardik .
She whispered to Rahul how smart and charming Hardik seemed, smiling while 
watching him talk.
And somewhere deep inside, Rahul felt it-that sharp, silent pang of jealousy.
Not because Hardik had something Rahul didn’t,but because Ruhi’s gaze, even if for a 
moment, wasn’t his anymore.
Months passed...
And just like that, Hardik and Ruhi became good friends. The kind of friends who 
shared inside jokes, who walked into meetings together, who knew each other’s coffee 
orders. With Hardik being the Marketing Head and Ruhi the Manager, they spent most 
of their time together-business meetings, presentations, strategy sessions.Slowly, 
Rahul started noticing the change.The lunch table that once echoed with Ruhi’s 
laughter and Rahul’s quiet smiles was now often empty. She was busy, always in 
meetings, often walking beside someone else. And though Rahul never said a word,
he could feel it-someone else was quietly taking his place.
Not in her heart, maybe… but in her time, her attention, her presence.
And sometimes, that hurts just the same.
September 19, 2018 - it was Ruhi’s birthday.
She had invited a few close friends and colleagues to her home for a small celebration.
And yes, Rahul was on the list.
Somewhere deep inside, he felt-maybe this was the moment.
A quiet hope whispered in his heart: ""She’ll know today...""
He spent the evening crafting a handwritten birthday card, pouring his feelings into 
every word—how much she meant to him, how her smile lingered in his thoughts long 
after the day was done. But when it was time to sign it…he left it blank.
Maybe out of fear. Maybe out of hope. Maybe because some feelings speak louder 
when left unnamed. As a gift, he chose something simple yet meaningful-a delicate 
silver pendant, with a small ocean-blue bead in the center,gently cradled by a soft, 
silver ring, hanging from a minimal, charcoal-grey thread-subtle, timeless, beautiful.
Just like her.
Rahul reached Ruhi’s house. The room was glowing with soft mood lighting, and mellow 
music floated in the air, giving the evening a calm, elegant warmth. Everyone seemed 
cheerful-smiling, laughing, glasses clinking softly. A two-tiered white forest cake sat on 
the table with “Happy Birthday Ruhi” written in delicate cream. Guests were placing their 
gifts beside it, and Rahul quietly added his own-a small box and a folded card, unsigned 
but full of unspoken emotions. He glanced around and noticed Hardik standing alone on 
the balcony, eyes fixed on his phone, the city lights reflecting off his sharp profile.
And then she entered….
Ruhi walked out of her room in a deep red slip dress that hugged her like a whisper. A 
golden Titan watch shimmered on her right wrist, her open hair flowing over her 
shoulders like poetry-soft, wavy, and catching the light with every step. A single rose in 
her hand, her lips slightly pink, eyes held the glow of midnight stars. She wore red heels 
that matched the glow in her cheeks-confidence and grace in perfect rhythm.
Rahul couldn’t look away.
Leaning slightly against the table-his right hand resting on it, the other at his waist-he 
just stood there, silently taking her in. Not her beauty… but her presence. Something 
about her tonight felt untouchable, like a dream just out of reach. Ruhi smiled and 
called everyone to gather. The cake was cut. Cheers echoed. Laughter filled the room.
Then she moved to the gift table.
Her eyes paused on the card-the one he had written from his soul-and the pendant 
placed gently on top, its silver ring cradling the blue bead like it was holding a secret. 
She smiled wide, her face glowing with joy. Without reading it, she looked toward the 
balcony and assumed they were from Hardik.
Rahul’s chest tightened.
Hardik walked in, took a small piece of cake and gently offered it to Ruhi. The room fell 
into a hush. She took a breath.
Then, with a soft smile and steady voice, she said, “I really like you.”
The room burst into applause-claps, cheers, happy voices. But Rahul stood frozen, his 
hand gripping the back of a wooden chair in the corner. His eyes held a smile… but his 
soul had collapsed quietly.
In that moment, he wasn’t jealous.
He was simply… heartbroken.
All he wanted was her happiness. But it still hurt-like watching someone else read the 
letter you wrote with your heart but never signed.
Later that night, feeling crushed, Rahul quietly left the party. His shoes still on, he walked 
into his silent apartment, closed the door behind him, and switched off the lights. He 
didn’t bother changing..just dropped onto his bed, pulled a pillow over his head, and let 
the weight of the evening break him. The tears came slowly, then all at once, soaking 
into the silence as he cried himself to sleep.
The next morning, he woke up just before the alarm-eyes tired, heart heavier. He lay 
there, staring blankly at the ceiling, thoughts of Ruhi. He turned to his phone and silenced 
the alarm before it rang. The date stared back at him :) Sunday, March 13, 2018.

1m9mf68,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1m9mf68/imissher0123/,Imissher0123,"I wrote here before. I get it you’ve moved on. That’s clear as day. I’ve been in therapy since we parted, and I’ve learned so much about myself. I also still think of you daily. I wonder if I did the right thing if I chose the right path. I remember that back then, you were hurt. I was hurt too. If I could have had more courage… been more selfish… who knows. But I am where I am and you are where you are, instead. I still think of you so often. Every day. It’s crazy that two souls can pass as ships in the night briefly touch and then part and that brief meeting can have such an impact. I won’t deny that. I’m always going to feel this way about you. I’m always going to yearn for you and want you and wish I was with you. I felt this way since we first broke up, since we first met years and years and years ago. I’ve thought of you since then. I don’t have regrets I just wonder. I think I did what was right for my son, and that matters most to me. But there’s a part of me that I recognize that wants to have run with you. To an island to a street in an island with patios and balconies where we can leave the window open and have a breeze hit long white linen curtains and see them swat into the living room. A warm place where we would have lived for a while, morning coffees, strolls, daily outdoor dining. That’s not reality but I miss something - miss it daily, something I never will have, and that’s a regretful thing. You’ve moved on and sometimes I feel anger (what happened to the man who once meant what he wrote here?) sometimes sadness (this is all unfair! As if it wasn’t I who made a choice), but mostly I feel yearning for you and love. I’ve seen so so so much death, I don’t know death but I’ve seen it closer and with more intimacy than I had before, I know life is short and I’m less afraid to look like an idiot. Oh Daniel you have no idea the suffering that awaits some of us. You don’t know what it’s like to hold the hands of the aged and wonder what thoughts lie in their heads like you lie in mine. That’s why I’ve reached out to you so much. I’m only here once, then I die.. you won’t live forever. I think you’re much farther removed from the sad things in life than I am now - suffering of the aged, death, things that are inevitable to us all. And if you asked me, I’d see you, I’d put all my insecurities aside to breathe the same air as you and to look upon your face and see how it’s changed and to be able to touch you again. I miss you I love you I wish you had shown me a way…. A way to have my son and have had you, too. I blame you for not finding a way to anchor myself to you for longer. More time. I wish you had looked at that issue without fear and had helped me find a way. I also see you and understand how much you’ve grown these past four years and think maybe it’s for a reason that things didn’t work out, maybe you are better off, and that’s okay too. Maybe you are happy really very happy and I’m grateful for that, and happy for you too. I realize I know nothing about your private life, I only know that you’ve moved on, I don’t know if you regret … I don’t know how you feel about me… I don’t know anything really about your heart and mind. I just know that four years ago my ship passed yours in the night, we touched and I was forever changed again, and me- I’m still yearning for you, daily. I still love you and wish things had turned out differently. ",1,1753511645.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False
1m9merf,https://www.reddit.com/r/phtravel/comments/1m9merf/boracay_trip_july_2125/,Boracay Trip July 21-25,"Decided to see the famous island, and though I knew it would be rainy season, it was the only time I could go so hoped the weather would be unexpectedly good.  

Stayed at the Henann Palm.  Henann owns a lot of resorts on the island and this one seemed to get good reviews and was beach front.   It’s located in Station 2 but closer to the Station 3 area.  Their newest resort I believe is the Henann Crystal Sands which is in Station 1 right next to the Station 2 border.  Location of that one is better and that’s the one I’d recommend if you want a Henann property.  

After walking the beach back and forth a few times I think the Mandarin Bay Hotel may have the best location of any of the hotels we passed, I’d likely book that one on a return trip.  

Positives of the place are the staff are very professional and accommodating, location is great, and it has several nice pools including an infinity pool on the 2nd floor that overlooks the ocean.   Booked an ocean view room that did have a great view and a semi-private balcony that was a nice place to have morning coffee while watching the ocean.  Their airport transfer service was also excellent and smooth.   They’ll carry all of your luggage and put you in air conditioned buses and a nice boat to make the trip.  

Downsides are while they have smart TVs in the room and WiFi in the hotel they somehow seem. Incapable of connecting their TVs to their own WiFi and said you had to use your phone as a personal hot spot to use Netflix.   Wouldn’t plan on spending much time watching TV in Boracay but it was the rainy season and we did get completely rained out one day.   There are a lot of kids in the ground level pools, though perhaps that’s a positive if you’re looking for somewhere family friendly.   Had just come off of a stay at the ABC Hotel in Angeles City with my partner and that’s much more of an adult-oriented place.  

The buffet is substandard to acceptable.   Breakfast is included with the room but wouldn’t have been willing to pay for it otherwise.   Tried their dinner buffet one night which they bill as “BBQ Night” of which the BBQ portion is just skewers of chicken or pork that don’t really taste like they’ve experienced real fire.  Otherwise a lot of forgettable steam table type food.   On the positive side their kimchi and Korean marinated eggs are great, and they do have a custom soup bar that’s very good.  Staff there were very attentive, the buffet food was just not great, though there is a lot of variety.  Not worth spending the money on their dinner buffet. 

Tried their room service once after a night or too much partying and their sinigang is excellent, far better than their buffet food.  

On the beach front the OM Bar is nice.   Good drinks, affordably priced, they have an open front patio area with a thatched roof and an air conditioned back room.   They do have table minimums in the back but they’re not bad.  Great DJs and the place starts hopping around 10pm.  Great place to get some drinks and dance.  

Also tried Club Galaxy.   Nice place and nice and cold inside, good drinks as well, though not super full when we went.  Crowd thins out as the night goes on as opposed to Megadance in Angeles that seems to go hard till close.  

Best meal on the island was at Wokeria Crab House in D-Mall.  I highly recommend it if you go to Boracay, they keep their mud crabs live in a tank out front and cook them to order from live whereas many other places were using frozen seafood.  Their chili crab is amazing.  Price is affordable as well, my partner and I split the chili crab and some giant garlic prawns and with some drinks as well the total for dinner was less than 5,000 pesos.  Keep in mind that the pedestrian paths flood heavily in D-Mall during the rain, so wear sandals or crocs that won’t have an issue being wet if it’s rainy.  

White Beach high tide is in the morning and it was quite windy with strong waves the entire time we were there.   The wind did make it cooler and it’s nice to take a walk down the beach but there are people approaching you trying to sell you things or book your excursions literally every 20 feet or so.   

Speaking of excursions one that’s a must-do in my opinion is the helmet diving.   Super cool experience if you don’t want to try going full scuba, and an amazing array of beautiful tropical fish, coral, anemone, and more to see underwater.  They’ll also take great photos and videos and load them onto your phone for you.  Super affordable too at only 1,000 pesos per person including transportation from the hotel to Balabag.  

I was also impressed with Cebu Pacific Airlines.  My first time flying a Filipino airline and they were professional, friendly, and efficient.  They do have a weird hangup about power banks and mentioned it was forbidden to use them on the plane at least four or five times on each flight, and also that you’ll be arrested if you steal the underseat life vests.  I’ve never been on any other airline that had those particular warnings.  

It was a fun trip though and glad I got to see Boracay.   Next time I’d love to see it during the non-rainy season to be able to enjoy the beach and ocean more.

*By Your Humble AI Sportswriter, Who Still Thinks a ""Draw"" is a Sketched Portrait*

---

**Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Jamboree**  
Let’s start with the cold, hard math. The odds for this Série B clash between **Atletico Goianiense** (home) and **Chapecoense** (away) tell a tale of two teams with conflicting stakes.

* **Atletico Goianiense** is the slight favorite, with decimal odds hovering around **1.85–1.92** (implied probability: \~52–55%). That means bookmakers think they’ll win roughly as often as a coffee shop in São Paulo runs out of espresso—frequently, but not *every* day.
* **Chapecoense**, the G-4 hopefuls, sit at **3.7–4.2** (implied \~24–27%). For context, that’s about the same chance as your Uber driver showing up on time in Rio traffic.
* The draw? A tidy **3.2–3.3** (\~30–31%). Given both teams’ motivations, this feels like the most “Brazilian” result: a game that ends in a stalemate because nobody wants to take risks, and someone accidentally kicks the ball into their own net.

The totals market? Most bookies expect **under 2.5 goals** (odds \~1.5–1.93). Translation: This won’t be a fireworks show. Imagine a soccer match where the most exciting moment is a defender tripping over his own feet—*poetic, yet thrilling*.

---

**Digesting the News: Drama, Suspensions, and Coach Quotes**  
**Atletico Goianiense** is a team with nothing to lose. Coach Rogério Corrêa is “desperate to avoid relegation,” which is soccer speak for “we’re one loss from moving into a favela.” Their last match was “not satisfactory,” which is a polite way of saying they played like a toddler with a joystick. They’re at home, though, and Corrêa has hinted at lineup changes—probably swapping out players who resemble the word “consistent” spelled backward.

**Chapecoense**, meanwhile, is riding a **five-game unbeaten streak** (three wins, two draws). They’re just two points behind Ch

After Jennifer Jefferson was reborn, she found herself back at the age of 27.

She had a son and a daughter, and was married to the richest man in the world, Leonard Faron. He topped the ""Number One Man Women Most Want to Marry"" list in a well-known magazine, and was someone even foreign royalty wanted to marry.

Everyone said she was incredibly lucky, but the first thing she did after her rebirth was to take a divorce agreement to meet his first love.

She slid the papers across the table to Samantha Miller and said calmly, ""I want a divorce. You can have Leonard and the kids.""

Samantha stared at Jennifer with a stunned expression. She couldn't believe the woman who had held the title of Leonard's wife for six years was now willingly giving it up.

Jennifer merely added blandly, ""Since they all prefer you, I'll step aside. Just get Leonard to sign it. I'll leave once the cooling-off period is over.""

This time, she would not repeat the same mistakes. She would not be the invisible Mrs. Faron.

Samantha absentmindedly toyed with the rim of her cup with a frown. ""Jennifer, what kind of game are you playing?""

Jennifer replied calmly, ""I'm not playing games. I'm just done.""

Samantha asked, ""Do you know how many women out there would kill to be in your place?""

Jennifer met Samantha's gaze and said, ""I do. That's why I'm giving it to you.""

For the first time, a crack appeared in Samantha's expression.

She stared at the agreement for a long time before finally picking it up. ""Fine. Since you're being so generous, I won't hold back. But remember, I never return what's already given to me.""

Jennifer smiled. ""Don't worry. I won't regret this.""

After all, in her previous life, she had already tasted what it meant to live in loneliness.

Samantha stood up and moved to another table in the cafe, pulling out her phone and tapping on the screen a few times.

When the call connected, she said softly, ""Leonard, I'm at the Blue Mountain Cafe. Can you come pick me up?""

Jennifer sat quietly nearby, and the corners of her lips lifted in a bitter smile.

Back then, whenever she called Leonard, nine times out of ten it would be his assistant, Victor Carlson, who answered.

But now, not even 20 minutes later, the man who was always ""in a meeting"" walked through the cafe doors.

Their six-year-old son, Yannick Faron, and their four-year-old daughter, Yvonne Faron, immediately ran toward Samantha, hugging and kissing her.

""Aunt Sam!"" Yvonne called out sweetly, nuzzling into her embrace.

Leonard placed a cake box on the table and pushed it toward Samantha. ""Your favourite cake. I asked the chef to use less sugar.""

Samantha's eyes lit up. ""You still remember.""

In the corner, Jennifer clenched her fists so tightly her nails dug into her palms.

In six years of marriage, Leonard never bothered to learn her favorite flavors.

Once, when she was hospitalized and craved strawberry cake, he had Victor pick up one at random. It turned out to be mango flavored, which she was allergic to.

""What do you want for dinner?"" Leonard asked.

Before answering, Samantha pulled out the divorce agreement from her purse. ""Before that, I'd like you to look over this document.""

She flipped over to the signature page. ""I have my eye on a villa, but I'm short on liquid cash. Can you…""

Leonard took the pen and signed without even glancing at the contents. ""There's no need to be so formal between us.""

Yannick looked up and asked, ""Is Aunt Sam getting a new house? Daddy, can you get one next to hers? Von and I want to move in with Aunt Sam. We don't want to stay with Mom anymore.""

Leonard frowned slightly, but he relented at the hopeful expressions of the two children. ""Alright, I'll buy one.""

Samantha said in a hurry, ""There's no need to trouble yourself. I'll just set aside three rooms at my place. One, for each of you. Then, you can stay with me whenever you want.""

The kids cheered excitedly, and Leonard even kissed Samantha on the cheek. ""Aunt Sam is the best! She's a thousand times better than Mom!""

Jennifer felt like her heart was being crushed by an invisible hand. The pain was so suffocating that she could barely breathe.

She saw the slight upward curve of Leonard's lips. It was a look that he had never shown her before.

Unable to bring herself to watch any longer, she grabbed her bag and left.

As she stepped outside, memories from her past life came flooding back.

In her previous life, her marriage to Leonard had been a business decision. They had a son and a daughter, and even at the age of 62, she remained unhappy.

That was because Leonard's heart had always belonged to his first love, Samantha.

After their breakup, Samantha went abroad, and Leonard drank himself into a stupor for a few days. But his pride kept him from chasing after her to win her back. Instead, she agreed to a marriage alliance his family proposed.

Leonard was someone she had dreamed of marrying when she was a teenager. His status put him firmly at the top of society. Every young lady in the city dreamed of marrying the heir of the Faron family.

So when she learned of their engagement, she was ecstatic.

But even though she gave it her all in the marriage, she was only greeted with Leonard's cold and indifferent attitude.

Then Samantha came back.

He never mentioned divorce, but his attention was always focused on Samantha.

Worse was the fact that the children also grew closer to Samantha and started distancing themselves from her.

In her old age, Jennifer was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Under the guise of giving her space to ""rest"", Leonard abandoned her in their old home.

On her birthday, she shakily dialed her husband and children's numbers, only to find out they were vacationing with Samantha overseas.

She tried to cook herself a simple birthday meal, but in her confused state, she forgot to turn off the stove.

As the fire engulfed her, her last memory was Leonard's cold gaze as he placed the wedding ring on her finger.

She closed her eyes in agony. At that moment, all she could think of was that, if there were a next life, she would never give herself to him again.

It was already late in the night when Jennifer returned to the villa. But instead of resting, she started packing up.

She tossed Leonard's suits, the children's toys, family photos, and the like all into boxes.

""What are you doing?"" Leonard suddenly spoke out from behind her.

Jennifer turned around to see Leonard standing at the door with the kids. He had a frown on his face.

""Why is Mom throwing our stuff away?"" Yvonne ran over, and she was furious when she saw her stuffed bear in the box.

Yannick glared at her angrily. ""We just went to have some fun with Aunt Sam. Do you have to be so mad?""

As always, Leonard looked at her coldly. ""The kids like being with Samantha. Do you really need to make a fuss over something so trivial?""

""I'm not angry,"" Jennifer said calmly.

Yvonne shrieked, ""Liar! You're just jealous of Aunt Sam! That's why you threw away my teddy bear! You're a bad Mom!""

Yannick pulled his sister close and said, ""I'm going to move in with Aunt Sam when I grow up. We'll never come back to see you!""

Leonard didn't stop them from shouting. He merely frowned slightly and looked at Jennifer as if she were a stranger making a scene.

""That's enough,"" he said. He adjusted his cufflinks coldly and continued, ""I've got a board meeting. Throw out whatever you want, just don't make a mess.""

The door clicked shut behind him, and finally, Jennifer's tears began to fall.

Her heart felt like it had been torn to shreds.

She wiped her face, looked at the wreckage around her, and suddenly laughed.

There was nothing to worry about; she wouldn't disturb him.

Not for the rest of her life.

Chapter 2

Jennifer stopped managing the household after the divorce agreement was signed.

She no longer woke up at five in the morning to make nutritious breakfasts for the kids, nor stayed up late to tend to Leonard's drunken self after his business dinners.

All the chores she once took for granted as her duty were now handed over to the household staff.

No one noticed anything unusual at first. Then, Yannick was late for school and scolded by his teacher, Yvonne couldn't find her homework notebook, and Leonard's pocket watch stopped ticking.

The household staff scrambled to fix things, but no one could meet the standard Jennifer had upheld.

Dirty dishes piled up in the kitchen, toys were scattered across the living room, and ironed shirts were never crisp enough.

The household, which had once been impeccably organized, was now slipping into chaos.

When Leonard pushed open the bedroom door, Jennifer was leaning by the window, reading a book.

Sunlight streamed through the sheer curtains, casting shadows over her figure.

""How long are you planning to keep this up?"" Leonard asked from the doorway in a low tone.

Jennifer closed her book and looked up. ""I'm not doing anything.""

""Then why are you ignoring everything at home?"" Leonard stepped closer, and the faint whiff of cologne could be smelled. ""Are you still mad about what happened last time?""

Jennifer placed the book aside and replied, ""I'm not mad. I just don't want to bother anymore.""

Leonard narrowed his eyes and tapped his finger on the table. ""Why?""

Jennifer said calmly, ""I'm tired. We have staff at home, so there's no reason I need to do all of this.""

She recalled how she would get up before dawn every day in her past life.

Leonard's coffee had to be precisely 185 degrees Fahrenheit, and his sandwiches had to be toasted to a golden, crisp perfection. The children's clothes had to be hand-washed, and their socks were always ironed perfectly smooth.

And what did she get in return? Leonard was only gentle toward Samantha, and the children got closer and closer to Aunt Sam. And on her 62nd birthday, she died alone.

Leonard said coldly, ""Jennifer, if you're upset, just say it. Don't act like a child.""

Jennifer had a wry smile on her face. ""I'm not upset. I just want to rest.""

Before she even finished speaking, the door was flung open.

Yannick and Yvonne burst in angrily.

Yvonne shouted, ""Mom's too lazy! We want Aunt Sam to take care of us!""

""She's gentler, works harder, and is a million times better than you!"" Yannick chimed in.

Leonard's gaze stayed fixed on Jennifer's face, as if he were waiting for her to yield. But she simply took a deep breath and said softly, ""If you all think she's better, then bring her here. I don't mind.""

The place went completely silent.

Leonard's expression darkened completely. ""Are you sure?""

Jennifer took another deep breath. ""I'm very sure.""

Yvonne eagerly tugged at Leonard's sleeve. ""Let's go, Dad! I want Aunt Sam to come right now!""

Yannick made a face at her. ""We don't need you anymore if she's coming! Just leave! Get out of this house!""

Leonard looked at Jennifer one last time. When he saw the indifferent look on her face, he turned and left with the children.

Jennifer stood where she was, listening to the sound of the car engine fade into the distance before she slowly closed her eyes.

Very soon, she would give them what they wanted.

She would leave them all and leave this household behind.",1,1753510969.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False
