1q5qd8c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q5qd8c,6th January 2026 — A Day Caught Between College & Fatigue," Today started a little better than usual. I woke up at 8:00 AM, but honestly, I had zero motivation to leave the bed. I don’t know why—just one of those mornings where your body refuses to cooperate. Eventually, I got up, went to the bathroom, had my syrup, and got dressed for college.
Going to college after so many days actually felt good. I packed my lunch and headed out. At the college gate, something unusual happened—the guard asked for my ID. They usually don’t, but today they did. After showing it, I went to the classroom and met my homies Aryaman and Raman. That instantly lifted my mood a bit.
I attended the class and saw Archi too. After that, I moved to the next class where Aryaman made a Hinge account, and we did some random chit-chat. Soon it was lunchtime, so we went to the ground and had chole, roti, and one samosa.
While we were eating, some puppies came over, probably hoping for food. Zoha and Sneha started playing with them—though Sneha honestly doesn’t know how to handle a puppy and ended up hurting its arm. That annoyed me.
After lunch, Prashant, Sahil, and I noticed some people playing football. We felt like joining them, so we did. We played for a while, got completely exhausted, and then decided to chill at the canteen with a cup of coffee.
Later, we went back to class. I watched Succession during the lecture, and once that class ended, I attended the cloud computing class. There, I casually bragged about my internship, and Archi turned back and gave me a look. That moment genuinely felt good.
After all the classes ended, I headed back home. While leaving college, Aditya stood beside Archi when I was taking my bike from her side—as if I was going to hit her or something. That pissed me off, but whatever.
Back home, I made a quick sandwich and had tea, relaxed a bit, and then went to the park for my workout. Still, the day felt unproductive—college drained all my time and energy.
After returning from the workout, I had muesli with full-cream milk, and later had dinner. Then I got into bed and wasted time scrolling through reels—again, unproductive.
Now, I’m finally writing this journal. The day is ending, and I’m feeling extremely sleepy. I just want to sleep peacefully.
By God, let tomorrow be better.

1q5qcgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Leather-Buddy-7902/comments/1q5qcgy/i_nearly_burned_out_building_my_startup_then/,"I Nearly Burned Out Building My Startup, Then Everything Changed (Lessons Learned)","Hey Reddit, wanted to share a raw story from my early startup days that honestly still gives me shivers. For the first year, I was *the* guy. Coding, sales, customer support, even making coffee runs – you name it, I was doing it. Sleep was a myth, and my diet consisted mostly of lukewarm coffee and sheer panic. I genuinely believed that if I wasn't personally overseeing every single pixel and every customer email, the whole thing would just crumble. The pressure was immense, a constant, dull ache behind my eyes.

I remember one particularly brutal week. We had a massive product launch coming up, a huge bug popped up, and a key investor call was looming. I hadn't slept more than three hours a night for a solid month. I was staring at my laptop screen at 3 AM, tears blurring the code, feeling this crushing, suffocating weight of responsibility. My brain just... froze. I couldn't write another line, couldn't send another email. It was pure, unadulterated burnout. I felt like a total failure, a fraud, and just wanted to quit right there.

The next morning, looking and feeling like a zombie, I dragged myself into our tiny office. For the first time, I truly *talked* to my small team. I was vulnerable, admitted I was completely overwhelmed, and asked for help. And you know what? They stepped up, big time. My co-founder took over the critical bug fix, our junior dev handled some urgent customer queries, and our marketing intern even prepped some slides for the investor call. I saw a spark in their eyes – a genuine desire to contribute and own parts of the business, which I had completely suppressed by micromanaging.

That day was a huge turning point. I learned the hard way that 'wearing all hats' isn't a badge of honor; it's a fast track to self-destruction and stifling your team. Trusting my team, empowering them, and delegating actual responsibilities not only saved my sanity but also made our product better and our company stronger. It wasn't just *my* startup anymore; it became *ours*.

It’s crazy how sometimes you have to hit rock bottom to realize the most fundamental lessons. Letting go felt terrifying at first, like jumping off a cliff, but it was the best decision I ever made. We ended up nailing the launch, impressing the investor, and I even got some actual sleep! The relief was palpable, like shedding a heavy cloak I didn't even realize I was wearing.

So, fellow founders and aspiring entrepreneurs, what's been your biggest ""aha!"" moment or a lesson you learned the hard way that completely changed your approach?",1,1767723507.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

I started this Jan 1, 2026 I am on day 5 now at 11:38 am central time.

Posting this because I read a lot on Reddit to prepare and now I hope to help someone who wats to get off this awful drug.

**Not medical advice — just my experience.**

**My mother is an amazing person. She let me stay with her for as long as I wanted.**

**I stayed the first 2 nights at her house. She helped so much. I didn't have the strength to make anything to eat so she made me shakes (i'll put what in the shakes below) I could drink. Just having the support was huge.**

**So if you can do this with someone who supports you, please use that help.**

**Also I got the lipsomal vitamin c idea from a reddit post here. Not sure if it helped but my be worth reading about before you start.**

# Background

* Substance: **7-OH**
* Daily use: \~**1000 mg/day for \~10 months**
* Quit method: **Cold turkey (no taper)**
* Last dose: **Thursday 1 Jan 2026 at 3:00 p.m.**
* Amount that day: \~**700 mg**
* Prep: **Mega-dosed lipsomal Vitamin C**
   * Started 3 days before quitting
   * Only preparation I did

I’ll say it upfront: **I should have tapered but I did not have the discipline.**

If you can manage to taper, I recommend it.

# 0–12 Hours After Last Dose

Felt mostly normal. Thought maybe it wouldn’t be that bad.

It was.0–12 Hours After Last Dose

Felt mostly normal. Thought maybe it wouldn’t be that bad but it was.

# ~12 Hours In (3:00 a.m.)

Withdrawal hit **hard and fast**:

* Severe restless legs
* Full-body restlessness
* Rapid heart rate
* Body aches
* Couldn’t regulate temperature
* **Extreme depression and sadness**

Slept maybe **2 hours total**.

# First 24 Hours

* Same symptoms nonstop
* Could only be out of bed \~30 minutes at a time
* Sleep came in **15-minute chunks**
* Protein shakes, with an egg , good butter, and liquids, with good electrolytes only
* Hot salt bath helped briefly, then I overheated
* Went to bed around 9 p.m., slept \~2 hours, then everything came back

# Day 2 (24–48 Hours)

* Woke up exhausted, couldn’t sleep again
* Forced myself outside around 11 a.m.
* Shirtless, barefoot sunlight helped **more than expected**
* Laid by the pool from \~12–3 p.m.
* That night:
   * Slept 7–8 p.m.
   * Awake 8 p.m.–2 a.m.
   * Slept 2–8 a.m.
* Restless legs were **noticeably better**

# Day 3

* Woke at 8 a.m.
* Still depressed but **not terrible**
* Protein shakes, with an egg and liquids, with good electrolytes
* \~1 hour of sun + shirtless basketball → helped mood
* Low-energy 1-hour bike ride before sunset
* Ate a small Whataburger meal (didn’t taste good, but got it down)
* Slept \~10 p.m.–2 a.m.

# Day 4

* Fragmented sleep overnight
* Tried coffee — didn’t enjoy it
* Ate half a Chick-fil-A salad
* By noon:
   * Body aches
   * **Fever: 100.1°F**
* Fever lasted **all day and night**
* Motrin + Tylenol didn’t help
* Felt gross, depressed, lethargic
* Slept around 10:15 p.m.

# Day 5 (So Far)

* Woke at 5 a.m.
* Decent sleep overall
* **No restless legs**
* Still have:
   * Fever (100.1°F)
   * Lethargy
   * Rapid heart rate
   * Depression and sadness
   * GI symptoms (honestly feels like my body purging)

# What has helped

* Sunlight (huge)
* Being outside
* Light movement
* Protein/liquids
* Vitamin C (details later)

Today (day 5) sucks, but it has to be the crap getting out of my system causing the fever.

Waiting for the sun to come out to go soak it up.

Also, this is my first ever reddit post, not even sure how to respond, but if anyone struggling with the devil of 7-oh wants to message me please feel free and I will figure out how to respond.

Stay strong everyone and lets all quit this 7-oh and get it banned so it doesn't ruin more lives.

I'll also post and update of day 5-7 once I go through it.

1q5q5e8,https://www.reddit.com/r/PickUpArtist/comments/1q5q5e8/text_game_help/,Text Game Help!,"So I got the phone number of this stunning tall Korean Girl at this higher class Korean fastfood restaurant last night. 
It was pretty sincere. I do photography, and she literally could walk off the cover of a magazine 5'9 naturally stacked, white skin, exotic features (wondering what she is doing at this fastfood joint in the first place, but whatever...)

Anyway I told her how she'd be great to photograph, but I'd have to actually get to know her before we could do anything and she should give me her info so we could set up coffee and a conversation.

And she willingly fed the receipt machine and gave me her number saying - ""text me anytime.""
This was at 8pm

So at 11pm I text her this icebreaker:

11am
ME:Cool making a new friend at ""Korean Restaurant"" tonight ""Ji-woo""

No response this morning, but she did read it.
And an icebreaker doesn't require a response!

So I'm debating on my new Opener Text for today based on two skools of thought. 
And she's Fucking really Hott so I don't want to lose a good opp from a lame text.

Skool 1 - Todd V is pin value into the void so like say:

ME: Hey ""Ji-woo"" I can totally see you in an image like this
INCLUDE IMAGE (Based on what I showed her last night via my portfolio)


Skool 2 based on the Girls Chase forum is more simple, literally:

ME: Happy Tuesday!

And then you hope she responds. And if she does you'd say something like:

ME:""So I heard that ""Korean Restaurant"" makes you work 7 days a week ""Ji-woo""

This is meant to get her to correct me and give me her schedule in-which I can initiate a soft close for coffee.

So ""what say you?""

I'm going to text her today/early tonight to try and get a date this week...
Get 'em out fast while you are on their radar!

I started this Jan 1, 2026 I am on day 5 now at 11:38 am central time.

Posting this because I read a lot on Reddit to prepare and now I hope to help someone who wats to get off this awful drug.

**Not medical advice — just my experience.**

**My mother is an amazing person. She let me stay with her for as long as I wanted.**

**I stayed the first 2 nights at her house. She helped so much. I didn't have the strength to make anything to eat so she made me shakes (i'll put what in the shakes below) I could drink. Just having the support was huge.**

**So if you can do this with someone who supports you, please use that help.**

**Also I got the lipsomal vitamin c idea from a reddit post here. Not sure if it helped but my be worth reading about before you start.**

# Background

* Substance: **7-OH**
* Daily use: \~**1000 mg/day for \~10 months**
* Quit method: **Cold turkey (no taper)**
* Last dose: **Thursday 1 Jan 2026 at 3:00 p.m.**
* Amount that day: \~**700 mg**
* Prep: **Mega-dosed lipsomal Vitamin C**
   * Started 3 days before quitting
   * Only preparation I did

I’ll say it upfront: **I should have tapered but I did not have the discipline.**

If you can manage to taper, I recommend it.

# 0–12 Hours After Last Dose

Felt mostly normal. Thought maybe it wouldn’t be that bad.

It was.0–12 Hours After Last Dose

Felt mostly normal. Thought maybe it wouldn’t be that bad but it was.

# ~12 Hours In (3:00 a.m.)

Withdrawal hit **hard and fast**:

* Severe restless legs
* Full-body restlessness
* Rapid heart rate
* Body aches
* Couldn’t regulate temperature
* **Extreme depression and sadness**

Slept maybe **2 hours total**.

# First 24 Hours

* Same symptoms nonstop
* Could only be out of bed \~30 minutes at a time
* Sleep came in **15-minute chunks**
* Protein shakes, with an egg , good butter, and liquids, with good electrolytes only
* Hot salt bath helped briefly, then I overheated
* Went to bed around 9 p.m., slept \~2 hours, then everything came back

# Day 2 (24–48 Hours)

* Woke up exhausted, couldn’t sleep again
* Forced myself outside around 11 a.m.
* Shirtless, barefoot sunlight helped **more than expected**
* Laid by the pool from \~12–3 p.m.
* That night:
   * Slept 7–8 p.m.
   * Awake 8 p.m.–2 a.m.
   * Slept 2–8 a.m.
* Restless legs were **noticeably better**

# Day 3

* Woke at 8 a.m.
* Still depressed but **not terrible**
* Protein shakes, with an egg  and liquids, with good electrolytes
* \~1 hour of sun + shirtless basketball → helped mood
* Low-energy 1-hour bike ride before sunset
* Ate a small Whataburger meal (didn’t taste good, but got it down)
* Slept \~10 p.m.–2 a.m.

# Day 4

* Fragmented sleep overnight
* Tried coffee — didn’t enjoy it
* Ate half a Chick-fil-A salad
* By noon:
   * Body aches
   * **Fever: 100.1°F**
* Fever lasted **all day and night**
* Motrin + Tylenol didn’t help
* Felt gross, depressed, lethargic
* Slept around 10:15 p.m.

# Day 5 (So Far)

* Woke at 5 a.m.
* Decent sleep overall
* **No restless legs**
* Still have:
   * Fever (100.1°F)
   * Lethargy
   * Rapid heart rate
   * Depression and sadness
   * GI symptoms (honestly feels like my body purging)

# What has helped

* Sunlight (huge)
* Being outside
* Light movement
* Protein/liquids
* Vitamin C (details later)

Today (day 5) sucks, but it has to be the crap getting out of my system causing the fever.

Waiting for the sun to come out to go soak it up.

Also, this is my first ever reddit post, not even sure how to respond, but if anyone struggling with the devil of 7-oh wants to message me please feel free and I will figure out how to respond.

Stay strong everyone and lets all quit this 7-oh and get it banned so it doesn't ruin more lives.

I'll also post and update of day 5-7 once I go through it.

1q5q1ld,https://www.reddit.com/r/theLword/comments/1q5q1ld/ash_silvercoffee_and_cults/,Ash Silver/Coffee and Cults,"She's a YouTuber who makes a lot of videos about the inside scoop of the L word, like behind the scenes and what the cast tells her and on her other channel ""Coffee and Cults"", she also mentions a bunch of stuff she knows from inside Hollywood a lot. 

I'm coming here cause I don't know where else to ask this, there's no subreddit of hers and I thought here's the most likely place people might actually know who I'm talking about. 

Do y'all think it's legit? I like her content, I'm not trying to snark or anything, it's just, sometimes she reminds me of this creator called Shannon Lester who would also always say she has inside knowledge of Hollywood because she used to work at a gossip magazine about celebrities and it was all a fraud and she was making shit up. 

I guess I'm just a bit suspicious because I don't see how a random woman would be so close to Hollywood stars and she never actually explains what job she had to get in with that crowd and want to know if y'all think she actually has inside knowledge or not, cause I don't like being lied to by creators lol.

This is one of those super chill oatmeal‑raisin cookie recipes where nothing is complicated and everything smells amazing. You just mix your dry stuff first—flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt—set it aside, then cream together your softened butter, eggs, and the two sugars (brown sugar makes it way better, but if you only have white, no one’s calling the cookie police). Once that’s smooth, you fold in the dry mix *gently* so you don’t end up with rock‑hard cookies (Believe me I have done it and didn't come out well). Then comes the fun part: dump in a mountain of oats and a ton of raisins (or walnuts, or both if you’re chaotic good, you can also add cranberry or your fav nuts) and mix until it all comes together. Scoop little balls onto a baking sheet, give them a tiny smush with a spoon, and bake at 350°F for about 20–30 minutes depending on your oven. They come out golden, chewy, and perfect with tea or coffee. Easy and quick if you're into it.  

What you need as ingredients:  
\- Raisins — 1½ cups  
\- Flour — 2 cups  
\- Sugar — 2 cups (half white sugar, half brown sugar)  
\- Eggs — 2  
\- Rolled oats (oat flakes) — 3 cups  
\- Unsalted butter — 2 sticks  
\- Baking powder — 1 teaspoon  
\- Cinnamon powder — 1 teaspoon  
\- Vanilla — 1 teaspoon  
\- Salt — ½ teaspoon  
\- Baking soda — ½ teaspoon

First off, thank you for signing up for Yoink Adventures. Truly.  
Seeing real people join something that lived in my head for years is still kind of surreal.

Yoink is a passion project I have been vibe-coding for a long time. It is part travel journal, part scavenger hunt, and part choose-your-own-adventure game for the real world. The idea is simple: discover places, log where you have been, and share the journey. That could be national parks, coffee shops, tiki bars, roadside oddities, or categories that do not even exist yet.

I would love for you to:
- poke around the app  
- log a few Yoinks  
- follow some categories  
- and generally play with it  

Because this is still early, your feedback genuinely matters. If you run into any bugs, strange behavior, or technical issues, please let me know. The same goes for feature ideas, category requests, or any “it would be cool if…” thoughts. Many of the best ideas so far have come directly from users.

I am also trying to build a small but fun community around this project. The goal is to share discoveries, weird finds, and personal quests from all over the world. If that sounds like your vibe, I would love to have you join in here:

Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/YoinkAdventures/  
Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/yoinkadventures  

One important note about email:  
You will see a new email opt-out toggle in your profile. This message is being sent to everyone once. After that, you are fully in control of whether you receive emails from me.

If you decide this project is not for you at all and would like your account completely removed, just reply to this email and I can take care of that manually on the backend. No hard feelings at all.

That said, I really hope you stick around and help shape what Yoink becomes.

Thanks again for being here, and welcome to the adventure.

(29M/29F),"Hang in there with me—this is a long one. I have a lot of details to share and I’m hoping for some solid advice from strangers. I’ll divide this into two parts: background/context, and the ""date” and “post-date” themselves.

 

PART 1: Context

I (29M) went out with ""Jenn"" (29F) about three weeks ago on Dec 16, 2025. It wasn’t strictly a date, but rather a ""seeing each other after a year"" and hanging out one-on-one for the first time.

I’ve known Jenn on and off for about 5–6 years. I first saw her in late 2019 at a BBQ hosted by a mutual friend, Dave. I felt attracted to her right away. Because I lived abroad during the pandemic, I didn't see her again until a hiking trip of another mutual friend in mid-2021. When I mentioned seeing her at Dave's years prior, she said, “Oh really? I can’t seem to remember you.” It stung a bit, as I clearly hadn’t left an impression.

We became friends after the hiking trip and I added her to my Instagram. I even invited her and other newly met friends that day to my birthday party, which a few weeks after the hiking trip. She said yes at first, but she later declined (about two days before the party) due to family matters. This is where some “obstacles” or “yellow flags” start to appear.

A year later I invited her once again to my birthday, we had seen each other like 1-2 times again before at Dave’s usual BBQs. She tried to go, but declined once again, however she didn’t say why, only that she was busy that weekend.

After that, I backed off because I could tell she had a very demanding life. She is the main breadwinner for her household, supports her parents, and works two jobs. At the time, I didn't have the emotional bandwidth to date someone with that kind of stress, as I was working on my own social anxiety and insecurities. Since then, I hadn’t texted her personally until about a 1.5 months ago in late November 2025, which was a little over 3 years since we last texted. Our interactions in between had been mostly brief encounters at Dave’s (Jenn didn’t always go, but went about 50-60% of the time), which he used to do about every 6 months on average, and me telling her Happy Birthday on Instagram whenever she shared her photos/videos on her stories. She has been friendly in every interaction, but nothing beyond that.

Since then, I’ve tried dating apps, but with very low success. I personally hate them, I believe they’ve done more harm than good for the dating scene worldwide, but I use them regardless since it’s better than doing nothing. I also live quite far away from the city, about one to even two hours depending on traffic and which part of the city I’m heading to, which is quite a lot for people here, and can easily become a turn off when it comes to dating and meeting up with people in general.

 

PART 2: The Meeting and aftermath

Last November, a very strong gut feeling told me that I should reconnect with Jenn and finally invite her out, but only casually, nothing romantic. It took almost a month between me reconnecting with her via text to finally meeting up with her. I also had a lot stuff going on in between, so even I had to reschedule, but eventually we made it happen. For context: She is a ""hot and cold"" texter—she replies quickly but often disappears for days, and I am always the one initiating. Dave mentioned she is traditional and likes men to take the lead. I have only used texting to check in on her to then make plans with her, which I appreciate as well since we leave the fun and interesting conversations to have in person.

When we finally met up, she was very friendly, she gave me a long, warm hug when we said hi and when we said goodbye. We talked for about 2.5 hours over some coffee. I even gave her a small gift at the end (a kid’s coloring booklet she saw at a store that she really liked). This was a major green flag for me since it demonstrated how she was capable of really enjoying simple and “silly” things. In general, the “date” went well. She is very extroverted and transparent, while I’m more introverted but can be also quite extroverted with the right people. She did most of the talking, I think I laughed more at her jokes and anecdotes than she did towards mine. She laughed at about 60% of what I unintentionally or intentionally said to try to make laugh, which didn’t leave me that satisfied, but well, that was that.

What she did do was open up to me quite more than I expected. One of my best traits is that I’m a very good listener and non-judgmental, but also firmly disagree when I have to, therefore people tend to feel comfortable with me. She even spilled out the fact that she always wanted to be a mother, but that in recent years she has changed her mind. She also said that she has felt lonely since moving to the rural area (it’s really nice and peaceful, but lonely especially for people our age). Conversely, I initially never wanted to have kids, but in the past two years or so, I’ve recently decided I do want to a father eventually. I understand this is a delicate subject that could be a serious dealbreaker in the long term. I believe you can indirectly help people change eventually if you empathetically and properly illustrate your points of views and actions, but you can’t force them to do so, at the end of the day, that entirely depends on them.

At the end of our meet up, she was the one who said she had to leave. I accompanied her to her car. She wanted to take a photo, and send it to Dave, which we did. When she was getting in her car I asked when we shall we meet again. I told her I was planning on going to the yearly end of the year fair at her local town on Dec 27 (which is a whole weekend long event). By the way, that town is 25-30 mins from where I live, closer than the city where she used to live. She said she was going to have family over for the holidays and new year, but that she also wanted to go with them to the fair, and said that I could meet up with them that day. This was an interesting proposal, since most of my friends who I’ve talked said that it’s surprising for her or pretty much anyone to extend an invite with family so early like that to someone. For me it was also an opportunity to get to know them and be in their good graces so they can perhaps vouch for me to be with Jenn. One thing Jenn also mentioned was that her Mom had been pressuring her to go out more and meet new people.

That same night when I got home, about 2 hours later I texted her thanking her for spending time with me. She replied insanely quickly saying she was also texting me at that very same instant about to say the same thing. We laughed it off, but it was honestly quite nice since she showed that she already had the initiative this time to text me first. We exchanged like 2-3 messages back, she replied to my last text the next morning, I replied then about 3 hours later around lunch time, and then silence for days.

I once again reignited conversation on Christmas Eve, wishing her the best, and asking if she was after all going to the town/party fair on the 27th. She said yes, that she wanted to go with her family. When the day came, I texted her in the morning and she told me that she would be all day with her family in the city from 9am to 9pm, and that she will try to make it to meet up with me. During the late afternoon, we texted each other checking where we were at. She even sent photos showing that she was stuck in traffic trying to meet up with me. I told her to don’t worry, that there was no rush. When she got home, she said that she was exhausted and didn’t have the energy to go back out, I told her it was okay, that I might come back tomorrow for another event in the town and that I’ll definitely let her know the next morning. The next morning, I confirmed to her that I was definitely going, and asked her if we should meet up. She didn’t reply until roughly 4 pm, saying how where things were in the town, especially traffic, because she had to pick up more family from the airport that day. We exchanged a few messages, sent her photos of the event and the traffic and that was it.

From Dec 28 until yesterday, Jan 5, I hadn’t sent her a single text, not even Happy New Year. I went silent for two reasons: 1) for her and me to focus on being with family over the holidays, 2) to play it off cool. I only got two “signals” from her that she was somewhat perhaps thinking about me: 1) I posted an end of the year post thanking good things that had happened to me and sharing photos from my trips abroad (I like to travel a lot whenever I can), and she was one of the first people who liked it (she had never liked my posts before); 2) I also posted a few stories about two days ago (the first time in a while) and she was also one of the first to see them.

Yesterday, Jan 5th, I reconnected once again to say happy new year and ask how was her time with her family during the holidays. My plan was to the invite her out in her local area and/or go to a BBQ on Thursday Jan 8th, organized by a friend of Dave’s, who she isn’t that familiar with, but Dave and other mutual friends will also be there. Unfortunately, before asking her out, she told me she was a bit sick due to all the family visits and that she even had more family coming in this week and the next, but that she has had a good time so far with them, and even asked how I was doing. I told her to not worry, that I hope she feels better soon and that’ll I’ll check in with her later this week to see how’s she’s doing so we can hang out again, and then told her about my holiday season.

This is where I felt frustrated which led me to write this long post. She once again replied immediately when I texted her, I texted her about 10 minutes later since I had a work meeting going on, but she once again left me in the dark. I know my message left closure saying that “it’s ok, we’ll talk later”, but I would’ve been nice for her to at least say “ok”, “thanks, talk soon”, or even a simple emoji. I believe people no matter how busy they are, have at least 10 seconds to acknowledge a message. The way she says hi as well seems quite “friendzone-ish”.  I am most likely overthinking things, but this is where I would like some feedback.

 

Here is a summary of my green, yellow, and red flags from her:

 

GREEN FLAGS

She is kind, funny, honest, hard working, and enjoys the simple things in life

She is family oriented

We share similar values and even certain interests

We have lots of mutual friends

She is single and feels lonely having recently moved to the rural side.

She lives close.

She is really attractive, one might say even out of my league, although all of my friends who’ve spoken with this about say we could make a great couple.

She took the time from her busy schedule to meet up with me eventually.

She invited me to hang out with her family, which never happened, but the intention was there.

When we hung out, I obviously paid for the coffee, but she offered to pay her part, meaning she is considerate.

 

YELLOW FLAGS

She is the main bread-winner and her family seem to depend on her, perhaps over-depend on her a lot.

She has a dog who she treats almost like a human child. Don’t get me wrong, I love dogs, my family have 7 currently and have had 6 in previous years. However, the way she treats her dog might be a sign of lack of interest in having kids and chose to have a dog instead.

I always have to text her to make plans with her, which I’m generally fine with, but has felt a bit one-sided, but she is always somewhat reciprocal and tries to find a solution to hang out (for instance the idea of hanging with her family at the fair), until now maybe…

 

RED FLAGS

She now doesn’t want to have children in the long run.

Her texting habits of not acknowledging a message to show at least a slight hint of interest.

She says she super busy but is somewhat active on Instagram, posting stories every now and then.

I work two jobs as well (one is stable and the other not as much but still good) and I make okay money but have full control of my time. I also have good saving and investing habits, I spend very little. Jenn most likely as the main bread winner, earns more than me, maybe even way more. I personally don’t mind, great for her, but maybe for her it might be a turn off that I make less than her (we haven’t discussed much of that yet, so I’m mostly speculating here).

Her tone of voice especially with voice messages feels very friendly but also neutral, not many hints of romance or flirting.

She has had one serious relationship way back when she was in school that ended badly, and till this day she seems to still be healing from that, meaning she might not be open to a new relationship. Someone else told me this, not Jenn herself (and she doesn’t know that I know). This was also another reason why I gave her space for the past few years.

I personally feel she isn’t that curious since I ask the grand majority of questions.

 

NEXT STEPS:

My plan is to check in with her tomorrow (Wednesday) to see how she is feeling. If she feels better, I’ll propose once again hanging out with her on Thursday or for at least a brief moment during the weekend. If her response is vague or nonexistent, I’m moving on for now. I prefer taking things slow, but I also appreciate good communication, even it’s just succinct like acknowledging a message (especially from someone who I hope is as attracted to me as I am to her).

I lost sleep writing this post, I truly care about this woman, at least I’m deeply attracted to her. I feel like she is a one in a lifetime opportunity (I know this isn’t true, but it she truly seems that special) especially for someone like me who has had serious insecurities and bad luck with women my whole life and would really love to have someone by my side and enjoy life together.

Thanks in advance for your feedback and for reading this long post.

1q5pzpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensDiscipline/comments/1q5pzpu/how_to_be_more_attractive_as_an_introvert_the/,How to Be More ATTRACTIVE as an Introvert: The Psychology That Actually Works,"I spent years thinking I needed to become louder, more social, more ""out there"" to be attractive. Spoiler: that's bullshit.

After diving deep into research, books, podcasts, and honestly just observing what actually works, I realized something wild. The most magnetic people I know? Half of them are introverts. They're just playing a completely different game.

This isn't about forcing yourself into crowded bars or pretending to love small talk. It's about weaponizing what you already have. Here's what actually moved the needle for me.

stop apologizing for your energy

Introverts constantly downplay themselves. ""Sorry, I'm kind of quiet."" ""I'm not good with people."" Stop. 

Susan Cain's \*Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking\* completely shifted how I see this. Cain, who gave one of the most-watched TED Talks ever, breaks down how introverted traits like deep listening, thoughtfulness, and observational skills are MAGNETIC. The book won multiple awards and honestly should be required reading.

The thing is, people are starved for genuine attention. When you actually listen instead of waiting for your turn to speak? That's rare. That's attractive.

I used to think I was ""bad at conversation."" Turns out I was just trying to be someone else. Once I leaned into asking better questions and actually being curious, everything changed.

build depth, not breadth

Extroverts collect acquaintances. Introverts build depth. Use that.

Instead of trying to know everyone at the party, focus on knowing a few people really well. Quality friendships make you more attractive by default because people see you're capable of real connection.

Read \*The Charisma Myth\* by Olivia Fox Cabane. She's a former advisor to Google, Yale, and Harvard, and her research shows charisma isn't about being loud or dominant. It's about presence, warmth, and power, and introverts can absolutely nail this combo. The book has practical exercises that feel less like ""fake it till you make it"" and more like ""become the most authentic version of yourself.""

One exercise that hit hard: practice giving people your full attention for 60 seconds without thinking about what you'll say next. Sounds simple but it's brutal at first. Game changer though.

get comfortable with silence

This one's counterintuitive but silence is actually powerful as hell.

Most people panic during conversational pauses and fill them with garbage. Introverts who can sit in silence without freaking out? That reads as confidence. It creates space for deeper thoughts. It makes your words matter more when you do speak.

I started noticing this after listening to the \*On Being\* podcast with Krista Tippett. She's a master interviewer who uses silence intentionally, and you can literally hear how it draws people out. It's not awkward, it's intimate.

Practice this: next conversation, let there be a pause. Don't rush to fill it. See what happens.

develop ONE thing you're obsessed with

Passion is attractive. Period.

Doesn't matter if it's vintage typewriters, fermentation, urban planning, whatever. When you geek out about something, people feel that energy. It shows depth. It shows you're not just consuming content mindlessly.

I picked up \*Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World\* by David Epstein (dude studied performance across sports, music, science) and it made me realize that having diverse interests you care deeply about makes you MORE interesting, not less focused.

Also, having a ""thing"" gives people an easy way to remember and talk about you. ""Oh yeah, she's the one who knows everything about obscure coffee brewing methods."" Boom, you're memorable.

fix your physical baseline

Okay real talk. Attractiveness isn't just personality.

Lift heavy things. Introverts often neglect this because gym culture feels performative and exhausting. But physical strength changes how you carry yourself. It changes your face structure over time (yes really, through better posture and bone density). It changes your energy.",2,1767722759.0,MensDiscipline,0,1.0,False

Soo, its my boyfriend’s birthday now, and like my first boyfriend ever (and hopefully my last??)

Its been like almost two years since we were officially dating, um like, and so far the official dates we’ve gone on, have been pretty mainstream. Like i took him to my favourite restaurant, we went to red fort, and like yk, coffee, etc.

AND, HIS BIRTHDAY IS COMING UP IN LIKE A WEEK, AND I WANT TO PLAN THE BEST DATE EVER.

So, i was thinking like, on the day before, in the afternoon, i can pick him up, and we can have a spa day, like facialsss, haircuts, massage, rejuvenation and stuff, then we’d go watch dhurandhar movie ( I honestly lovethat movie, like yesssss, bloood and fighting, that is what i craveeeee) and after the movie, i was hoping that i’d take him shopping for a pair of glasses, grab something to eat, OMG MAYBE EVEN GET MATCHING SHIRTS, and then we’d go to my house, and i have those massaging recliners, so we can watch Netflix and like actually chill. 

OMG, SURPRISE: THEN I WAS THINKING, I CAN CALL HIS CLOSE FRIENDS THERE, AS A SURPRISE, then “house party”, ( and i love baking cakes, so obviously i will bake a cake for his birthday) then at midnight, i will surprise him with the cake, OMG, and i have crocheted a plushie that looks like him, WOW

Then, phir sab apne apne ghar rawaana ho jayenge.

SO, I HAVE MADE THIS PLAN, NOW I NEED INPUT FORM THE MARD JAAT, IS THIS ALRIGHT? OR AM I STUPID? HOW DO I MAKE HIM FEEL SPECIAL??

Its like, its his 21st birthday, THE DAY HE BECOMES AN OFFICIAL ADULT,

And i was thinking that on the official party, on D-Day, i should give him 21 gifts, yk?

GIFTS I HAVE DECIDED RIGHT NOW:

1) I have hand painted a pair of nike air forces, to look like a zebra, like with black stripes.

2) A candle set, that smells like blueberries, strawberries and lychees 

3) A KEYCHAIN, which has like mjölnir and strombreaker

4) A Non-Stick pan

( he lives with his friends, and i’m like so shocked that they don’t even have a non stick pan???? Like how do they even cook???)

5) Recipes list. ( i loove cooking, and over the years i have collected and refined my favourite food recipes to make, so i’m giving him a copy)

6) A t shirt, but like i made it like the Pinterest wali, with lip stick kisses on it

7) jade rollers and jade gua-sha

8)silk pillowcases

9) a handkerchief with hearts and his name embroidered on it

10) A MINI FRIDGE.

\- black string

You will split the banana straight down the center leaving a pocket 

On the paper write your name, and across your name write his. Date of birth, his hair, or even location place of work/home on the paper. It should look like a plus sign (+) 

On the back of the paper write “may it burn when you pee, you can’t get it up to anyone but me” 

Fold the paper three times away from you.

Place the paper into the pocket of the banana. 

Add all the spicy ingredients, used coffee grounds, and vinegar.

With the needles you will “stitch” the pocket. It should have a bunch of needles stabbed through the banana sealing the paper inside. Then wrap the string around the banana. With the black candle seal the string and needles and place the black candle on the banana.

For the whole time the candles burning just s\*\* talk it and show your domination. Make up scenarios, say that his dick isn’t what he thinks it is, say make it known he’s not good in bed etc. 

Throw it away far from your house.

* The deal comes just about three months after Washington offered to back Ethiopia’s $10 billion Bishoftu International Airport near Addis Ababa, marking the Trump administration’s first major business engagement in the Horn of Africa.
* “The United States in coordination with Ethiopia’s regulatory authorities, have finalized new veterinary health certificates authorizing the export of US live cattle, day-old chicks, and hatching eggs to Ethiopia,” the agency said.
* The agreement also opens the Ethiopian market to US bovine semen and bovine embryos.
* The US currently imports coffee, textiles and garments from Ethiopia, while exporting aircraft, engines, spare parts, machinery and wheat under a framework set by the 1951 Treaty of Amity.
* Ethiopia’s textile and apparel exports to the US under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa) were suspended in 2022 over human rights concerns.
* China remains Ethiopia’s largest foreign investor, followed by Saudi Arabia and Türkiye.
* US backing for the multibillion-dollar Bishoftu International Airport signals Washington’s effort to maintain strong ties with a key ally in the Horn of Africa despite Ethiopia’s internal challenges. 
* Policy priorities focus on moving from extensive to intensive livestock production, creating opportunities for US exporters of advanced genetics and reproductive technologies to improve yields and efficiency.

Soo, its my boyfriend’s birthday now, and like my first boyfriend ever (and hopefully my last??)

Its been like almost two years since we were officially dating, um like, and so far the official dates we’ve gone on, have been pretty mainstream. Like i took him to my favourite restaurant, we went to red fort, and like yk, coffee, etc.

AND, HIS BIRTHDAY IS COMING UP IN LIKE A WEEK, AND I WANT TO PLAN THE BEST DATE EVER.

So, i was thinking like, on the day before, in the afternoon, i can pick him up, and we can have a spa day, like facialsss, haircuts, massage, rejuvenation and stuff, then we’d go watch dhurandhar movie ( I honestly lovethat movie, like yesssss, bloood and fighting, that is what i craveeeee) and after the movie, i was hoping that i’d take him shopping for a pair of glasses, grab something to eat, OMG MAYBE EVEN GET MATCHING SHIRTS, and then we’d go to my house, and i have those massaging recliners, so we can watch Netflix and like actually chill. 

OMG, SURPRISE: THEN I WAS THINKING, I CAN CALL HIS CLOSE FRIENDS THERE, AS A SURPRISE, then “house party”, ( and i love baking cakes, so obviously i will bake a cake for his birthday) then at midnight, i will surprise him with the cake, OMG, and i have crocheted a plushie that looks like him, WOW

Then, phir sab apne apne ghar rawaana ho jayenge.

SO, I HAVE MADE THIS PLAN, NOW I NEED INPUT FORM THE MARD JAAT, IS THIS ALRIGHT? OR AM I STUPID? HOW DO I MAKE HIM FEEL SPECIAL??

Its like, its his 21st birthday, THE DAY HE BECOMES AN OFFICIAL ADULT,

And i was thinking that on the official party, on D-Day, i should give him 21 gifts, yk?

GIFTS I HAVE DECIDED RIGHT NOW:

1) I have hand painted a pair of nike air forces, to look like a zebra, like with black stripes.

2) A candle set, that smells like blueberries, strawberries and lychees 

3) A KEYCHAIN, which has like mjölnir and strombreaker

4) A Non-Stick pan

( he lives with his friends, and i’m like so shocked that they don’t even have a non stick pan???? Like how do they even cook???)

5) Recipes list. ( i loove cooking, and over the years i have collected and refined my favourite food recipes to make, so i’m giving him a copy)

6) A t shirt, but like i made it like the Pinterest wali, with lip stick kisses on it

7) jade rollers and jade gua-sha

8)silk pillowcases

9) a handkerchief with hearts and his name embroidered on it

10) A MINI FRIDGE.

What do I do?","I (32M) have a friend from college, ""Mark"", who I used to be pretty close with. We drifted over the years like most people do, but there was never a blow up or anything. He just kinda vanished from our group chats and would pop up once in a blue moon with a ""we should catch up"" and then disappear again. Last weekend I ran into him at a mutual friend's birthday thing (small, like 10 people). He was super friendly, acted like no time passed, and before he left he asked for my number again and texted me right after: ""Coffee this week? Missed you man."" I said ""yeah maybe"" mostly out of politeness, but it felt weird because we haven't been real friends in years.

Two days later, my close friend Jen (who is also connected to that same social circle) told me something I honestly didn't know. Apparently Mark dated her for a few months last year. He told her he was single, serious about her, and he even met some of her friends. Then she found out he was also seeing another woman at the same time, and not in a ""we're casual"" way, more like full on lying. When Jen confronted him, he flipped it on her, said she was being controlling, and then started telling people she was ""unstable"" and ""obsessed"" so he'd look like the victim. Jen isn't perfect (who is) but I know her well enough to know she wasn't making this up. She showed me the timeline and it was pretty clear he was juggling both and gaslighting her when it blew up. She also said she wasn't the only one, like this is a pattern with him.

Now I'm sitting here with this text from Mark asking to meet up, and I feel gross about it. Part of me wants to just ignore him or keep it short and fade out. Another part of me feels like I should say something, because if he thinks I'm still ""safe"" in the friend circle, he'll keep floating around and people will keep getting burned. But I also don't want to be the guy starting drama based on someone else's relationship stuff. I don't even know what I'd say to Mark without it turning into a mess. Do I owe him an honest ""I don't want to hang out because I heard what happened""? Do I just say I'm busy and leave it? And if I do distance myself, how do I do it without it looking like I'm picking sides and stirring things up?

Hello everyone! It took a couple days, but the mage-assisted expansions to my home to accommodate me and my ghoul have been finished! And it’s been decked out with all the aesthetics I’ve grown to realize scratch my brain in just the right way! For example, this is one of the rooms in the expansions she commissioned…

*The first attached image is of a rather peculiar-looking, pastel-colored room decked out in neon lights. A single window sits on the side of one of the walls, apparently overlooking a city at night. Though the city skyline outside the ‘window’ is very obviously fake, the two potted tropical plants in the room most certainly aren’t fake by any means. In the middle of the room is a couch designed to resemble an 80’s restaurant seat. A small coffee table sits in front of the couch, with several magazines lying on top of it.*

I ***LOVE*** this new place so much that I can’t really express it in words. If you were in my shoes, you’d understand. But I also found this thing right here!

*The second attached image is… some sort of metallic circular apparatus affixed to a cyan-tiled wall. Next to it is a keypad, a screen, and a small transparent container which holds what appears to be a flash drive. Cables connect the container, the screen and the keypad to the apparatus. Whatever this is, this was clearly made by someone associated with either the Technocratic Union or the Sons of Ether.*

I didn’t know what this was at first, but turns out it’s a portal! And depending on what’s in the container, I can even go in and take stuff out of what’s on the other side! But unfortunately, if the place on the other side has a sun, it’s best to wait until night on that side to go through. And you can even take living things out from the other side too!

*The third attached image is the New Hampshire Toreador in the same room as the device, standing with a gleeful smile on his face and holding a strange, three-legged creature with a light brown hide covered in stripes. And given its pose in the picture, the creature clearly does not enjoy being held and was squirming to escape the vampire’s grasp.*

I’m considering doing some experimenting with this crazy thing at some point in the immediate future, but first, I’ll need to ask my sire both about what this portal is doing here and if I can use it whenever I want. But until then, toodle-oo!

His growth mindset creativity and honesty are a big reason many people including me look up to him. This post is not an attack and definitely not coming from a place of dislike or envy. It is just a thought that has been sitting in my head and I wanted to put it out there.

Irfan recently launched his coffee brand Loop and while I get the business side of it I could not help but feel a bit conflicted. A lot of creators including Irfan often talk about self improvement discipline and living better lives. Coffee culture especially when it leans into sugar loaded drinks kind of clashes with that message for me.

In Pakistan around a quarter of the adult population is already dealing with diabetes or blood sugar issues depending on which estimates you look at. Sugar consumption is already out of control here. When influential creators step into businesses that indirectly promote high sugar habits it feels a bit ironic even if that was never the intention.

I know someone will say coffee itself is not bad and yes that is true. Black coffee is fine. But realistically most people are not drinking plain coffee. The cafe culture we are copying is heavy on syrups creams and desserts in a cup. Creators know their audience and the lifestyle they are selling along with the product.

This is not just about Irfan. A global example is MrBeast. He promotes hard work discipline and pushing limits but also sells Feastables which is still chocolate and sugar heavy even if marketed as better quality. It is the same contradiction just on a bigger scale.

I am not saying creators should never do food or beverage businesses. I am saying it is worth questioning how well these products align with the values they promote. When you have massive influence your business choices also send a message whether you like it or not.

I still respect Irfan and I will probably still watch his videos. This is just me being honest and a little uncomfortable with how motivation and consumption often get mixed together. Curious if anyone else has thought about this or if I am overthinking it.",1,1767722368.0,TeenPakistani,1,1.0,False

It would mean the world if any other guys who are also into health and supplements and nutrition could let me know what they have found has been a great dosage for them of Vyvanse but also what supplements and routine tweaks have maximize their sustainability and success with this medication.

At first it more so just hurt that he was too busy playing video games to spend time with me. We live together and it still felt like pulling teeth getting him to do anything with me (even just watching a movie or going to get groceries together). Now however, I’ve noticed that he’s not only too busy to spend time with me but also too busy to do anything useful around the house. We’ve always done 50/50 for bills but also chores around the house and now I’ve taken on 95% of the housework (he still takes out the garbage and makes dinner every so often but everything else has fallen on me). Last night before I left for work I asked him if he could salt the driveway and wash the dishes in the sink. When I got home not only had he not done either of the things I had asked him to, but there was an even bigger mess than when I left (cans all over the coffee table, ice cream left out on the counter etc.) I’m getting to the end of my rope here. 

Every time I bring my concerns about his gaming up to him he says that he needs alone time, which is fair and I respect that, but I also don’t feel that it’s fair that now not only do I spend all of my free time alone, I now spend it cleaning up after him. 

Is there a better way that I could go about this than just hoping he’ll do better?

When I got home I was looking through the Encyclopedia of 5000 Spells for a spell that would help me get into the school I want and I came across the Apple of Desire spell. And I had all I needed right there! Before today I had never even owned honey. It will be months until I know whether this works or not but I'm excited. I'm sorry if I sound stupid. I don't feel like I can identify as a witch since I'm super new to everything, and have only done my own spells before. 

For anyone interested in the spell, the instructions are:
With a thorn or pin, scratch your wish into the skin of a beautiful apple. Hold the apple in both hands and contemplate your desire. Dip the apple in cinnamon honey and eat it completely, savoring each bite.",2,1767722230.0,witchcraft,1,1.0,False

Honestly, I don't really care about monetization or anything right now, I just want to build and ship my first product. 

  
The idea is a platform where you can do all of your cold outreach directly so it will house all of the people you want to reach out to along with any little notes about them from previous coffee chats or just research. You can then write and directly send emails from within the application if you connect your Gmail account to it and schedule emails as well. You can have like templates because I often find myself sending the same type of email to the same audience like Alumni from my college, for example. All of the above is just like generic management stuff that isn't the main thing, but I think the really good feature would be a follow-up system built into the app. I feel like a lot of ""leads"" or people you want to network with that don't respond the first time are lost in the hundreds of emails you send, and their reason for no response could be one of a million. They might not have seen the email or saw it but forgot to respond, etc, etc. I think it would be very beneficial for students or other people to have an app which can manage all of that instead of doing it all on google spreadsheets. Management is also important because if everything is messy on some spreadsheet, you are probably less likely to do it and require more motivation to send those follow-ups rather than if you have a follow-up template saved and the app remind you or has it saved and you can send them all with one button. 

  
These are just my initial ideas and I would love if anyone can give some feedback on them. Whether this sounds like something you might use or if you would like to see some sort of additional functionality within the app or if it is complete garbage which would also be helpful to know.

Almost every day after five, the building goes quiet and it's just me, some coffee and the dim, yellow light from my office against the world. I like to listen to the radio to fill the silence - I can't exactly say what I've been listening to. I mostly just switch between channels.

I was deep into some paperwork, listening absently to some channel with 90s music. I have no particular music taste, as I said, and I don't remember the channel I listened to or the channel I switched to after that. All I know is that I came across a man talking in a relaxed, outgoing tone; the type of voice a radio host puts on.

""...and you couldn't pay me to go out on a night like this! It's so cold, so lifeless out there, which is why I'm glad I have a desk job. Am I right? While we're on that, tonight's topic is, you guessed it, jobs. Specifically hating our jobs. Come on, you mean to tell me you've never complained about anything at your workplace? What, you think I do this out of passion?""

He laughed, then continued: ""Text or call at \[number\] and let's talk about why you hate your job. Here it is, your chance to complain! I'll start - sometimes I feel awkward talking to myself. I'm literally staring at a beige wall, a fern and a coffee machine that only works for espresso as I'm talking to you. I'm a social being! You can't have me talk all by myself... drives a man crazy. Aah, here we have our first caller! Hello, hi - what's your name?""

""Um, Michael.""

The guy who spoke had a lower, sleepier voice.

""Hi, Michael! So, what do you hate about your job?""

""Pff, where do I start? I'm working 9 to 5 for some asshole no one can stand, and on top of that, the pretzel stand out the street shut down the other day. That was literally what I looked forward to every morning. Now I have no reason to go to work anymore.""

""That sucks. Why'd it shut down?""

""I have no idea, but I'm seriously thinking about opening up my own pretzel stand. I'd make a lot of money from other desperate corporate workers like me. I need a sweet treat.""

""And I support that. You could call it... Michael's Sweet Dream.""

""No offence, but that name sucks.""

""Pretzel Factory?""

""Isn't that the name of another stand?""

""I have no idea... aaand we have another caller on the line! Sorry, Michael, but I'll have to cut you off. Good luck with your pretzel business! You know what they say, do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life. Hi there! What's your name?""

""Hello, I'm Tim.""

""Hi, Tim! What do you hate about your job?""

""I'm a teacher. I think it's self explanatory.""

""What, the kids giving you trouble?""

It was weird, but something about Tim's voice bothered me.

""Yeah, you could say that. They're really stubborn. And the parents complain a lot... keep saying things like I should stick to the planned lessons and not go off topic, dude - I'm teaching them about life. I'm just really sad that they don't appreciate that. It's not fair that I'm almost losing my job over some bullshit-""

""Aah, Tim, I'm afraid we're on air, you can't say bullshit! What do you mean, losing your job?""

""I swear I just wanted to teach them about the real world, but then I get all these parents on my head, talkin' bout some killin' 'n shooting 'n...""

I couldn't quite place his accent.

""Wait, you taught them about killing?""

""I was just tellin' them to be careful and talkin' bout how many people get killed on the streets for nothin'... even inside. Even in break-ins. Lord, who knows, you could be alone right now and someone could break in and just kill you, just like that, right now, quick, no safety anywhere. Gotta teach them. Young.""

""Isn't that disturbing?""

""No. It's real.""

""But is it worth risking your job? Yeah, if the kids are safe and educated. I don't think so.""

I looked up from my computer. 

Had... the host answered his own question?

The more I focused, the more the lines between the two voices began to blur. At one point, I heard a raspy intervention but forgot what it had said. Maybe it hadn't been important.

And yet...

Something bothered me. I was alone at my desk, the whole office silent, a window to my right, my back to the glass door that was pointlessly closed, since I could basically see the dark hallway if I turned around. 

And anyone could see me.

What channel was this? As the conversation between what was now a high-pitched plumber talking about taking care of the world's bullshit carried on, I glanced out the window, to the neat spots of grass below me, nestled between the tall glass buildings. Two cars parked. One, mine. One, a stranger's. Door open. Some trail of water extending from the opened car door to the building. Water?

I looked back to my computer, then behind me. The hallway drowned out a poor flickering light in the distance. Something bothered me. Something itched just below my skin.

I thought of the entrance of the building. Of the beige walls, and the ferns. And the coffee machine that only worked for espresso.

I thought of what the host had said.  *I'll start - sometimes I feel awkward talking to myself. I'm literally staring at a beige wall, a fern and a coffee machine that only works for espresso as I'm talking to you-*

""Well, folks, we're approaching the end of our program. Don't forget to call the number \[xxx\] to have an intervention-""

I don't know why I did it, but I called the number. I just needed to see what was going on.

It rang a few times. The host went silent. 

My mind was spiraling. I had so many questions and my stomach was awfully tense, as it happens when you eat something wrong and your body can't decide if it needs to throw it up or not. The knot intensified as the phone just kept ringing and ringing. 

Then, someone picked up. 

I could only hear heavy breathing on the other side. That went on for longer than it should have, and then the breathing got a new rhythm. Accentuated from time to time. As if whoever was breathing was also walking.

Or going up the stairs.

My heart a painful knot, I shot up and darted to the door. My sweaty fingers struggled with the lock at my eyes scanned the dark hallway, unsure of what to expect. ""Who the fuck are you?"" I muttered into the phone. The heavy breathing stopped. 

In the distance, I could have sworn I saw someone cross the end of the hallway. Before I could ask another question, they hung up.

I'm now stuck here. My radio station also lost that channel. I don't know what to do.

**If you're reading this having not played this game, here it is:**  She moves in with a guy that makes puts absolutely no effort into making space for her. All of his stuff is quite literally spread out to take up as much space as possible... forcing you to move his stuff in an effort to squeeze her stuff in while still following the rules of where you can put things. And then there's the diploma that you can **only** hang in the bathroom over the toilet or hide it away under the bed. There are no other places that are valid.

Unless you go into the accessibility options so that you can put anything you can move anywhere you want provided that it fits.

So here's what I tend to do when I go petty revenge on the boyfriend level:

Living Room - I moved the decanter and wine glasses to the kitchen, which is where they belong anyway considering there's no wine bar in the living room and decanter was empty. Also I hid the Xbox in the bedroom closet (drawers.) Since I couldn't get move the weights out of the living room, I brought in the yoga mat.

Kitchen - I hid away most of the coffee stuff, moved the coffee cups to the top shelf, stuck his protein powder on a top shelf behind other stuff, hid away his pot & pan.

Bathroom - His stuff is mostly behind the toilet paper or in the drawer. Not even his toothbrush was safe.

Bedroom - Drawers used to hide his Xbox, Xbox games, Xbox controller, underwear, socks, ties. The rest of his clothing is under the bed except for one sweatshirt that I decided she should claim to not have an empty hanger. Diploma gets to hang out on what was his side of the bed.

As for why I have it out for the Xbox so much, I once had a shitty guy try to gaslight me that the controller wasn't too big when I have small hands and couldn't even reach all the buttons.",30,1767721876.0,GirlGamers,2,0.94,False

My friend and I (both late 20s) are planning to move to the NW suburbs soon. We’ve narrowed it down to **Schaumburg, Arlington Heights, and Palatine**, but we are tearing our hair out trying to pick the right one.

We’ve done some research, but we really need a ""vibe check"" from locals before signing a lease.

**Our Situation:**

* **The Household:** Me (Fully remote) + Roommate (Works onsite in Elk Grove Village).
* **The Commute:** Roommate needs to drive to Elk Grove for a 9-5 job. I work from home but want to head into downtown Chicago occasionally for fun/weekend trips.
* **Budget:** We are looking for a 2-bed around **$2000**

**The Big Dilemma (Social Life):** I’m a very social person and want to make new friends in the area. Since I work from home, I don't want to feel isolated.

* **Schaumburg:** Seems to have endless food/shopping options (and we love Asian food), but is it hard to meet people if you don't just hang out at the mall?
* **Arlington Heights:** Everyone raves about the downtown, but does the crowd skew older/families? Is there a scene for people in their 20s?
* **Palatine:** Seems like the affordable middle ground. Is the nightlife fun, or is it mostly dive bars?

**My Questions for you:**

1. **Remote Work Life:** For someone working from home, which town has better access to coffee shops, libraries, or coworking spaces where I can escape the apartment?
2. **Making Friends:** Which of these three towns has a better social scene for people in their late 20s/early 30s?
3. **The Commute:** Is the drive from **Palatine or AH to Elk Grove** significantly worse than from Schaumburg during rush hour?
4. **Apartments:** Are there any specific complexes you’d recommend that are popular with young professionals? (Or any we should absolutely avoid?)

No screaming, no cheating, no big dramatic blowups. That’s what makes this feel so gross. I work from home and my days have turned into this weird loop: wake up, laptop, emails, “just one more thing”, dinner, couch, scroll, sleep. I tell myself I’m present because I’m physically in the same room. But I’m not. I’m always half looking at a screen, half listening, half answering. She’ll tell me something about her day and I’ll do that “mmhm yeah” thing, then ask a question that proves I didn’t actually hear her. Last month she sat next to me on the couch and said, really quiet, “Do you even miss me when I’m not here?” and I LAUGHED, like this dumb reflex laugh, because my brain couldn’t compute it. She didn’t laugh back. She just nodded like, ok, noted. I tried to recover with a joke and it landed like a brick.

The worst part is how many little kindnesses I’ve been taking without noticing. She makes my coffee the way I like it even when she’s running late. She buys the stupid yogurt I like because “it was on the list in my head”. She’ll ask me how I’m doing and actually waits for an answer, and I give her the corporate version, “busy but good”. Meanwhile I’ve been treating our home like a co-working space with a roommate I happen to love. Two weeks ago she asked if I could take a walk with her after dinner and I said “not tonight, I’m wiped” while literally refreshing my inbox like it was a slot machine. She went alone. I didn’t even notice for , what, ten minutes? When she came back her eyes were puffy and she said she was just tired. I wanted to ask more but I chickened out because I was scared of what she’d say, and I hate that about me. I keep telling myself I’ll fix it tomorrow, and tomorrow turns into “next week” and suddenly I’m watching her fade. I don’t want to be the guy she has to beg for attention. I also don’t want her to stop asking because it hurts too much. I’m sitting here writing this because I can feel something slipping and I’m terrified it’s already too late.

1q5pg6k,https://v.redd.it/e8ujcmasnrbg1,Creé una herramienta gratuita y de código abierto VR Mirror Therapy para ayudar a mi pareja a recuperarse de dos accidentes cerebrovasculares y quiero compartirla con la comunidad (web y privada),"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share a project I’ve been working on, hoping it might help others in this community.

In 2023, my partner suffered two strokes due to an AVM (Arteriovenous Malformation), which resulted in right-side hemiparesis and aphasia. To help with her rehabilitation and neuroplasticity, I initially built her a physical mirror box. However, after researching and talking to therapists, I learned that VR (Virtual Reality) could offer a more immersive and effective experience for **Mirror Therapy**.

Being a developer, I decided to build a tool for her that is accessible to everyone.

**What is it?** It is a **VR Mirror Therapy application** that runs directly in your mobile browser. It uses your phone’s camera to ""flip"" the image of your healthy limb, tricking your brain into thinking the affected limb is moving (pain-free), which helps retrain neural pathways.

**Key Features:**

* **100% Free & Open Source:** I built this to help, not to make money.
* **No Install Needed:** It’s a web app. Just click the link and it works on iOS and Android browsers.
* **Private:** No registration, no login, and no data collection. You just open it and use it.
* **Accessible:** It works with any standard smartphone and cheap VR goggles (the $10 ones you can find on Amazon or AliExpress).
* **Global:** Translated into **50 languages**.

**How to use it:** I’ve made a short video explaining how it works here:   
👉 **Demo Video:** [https://youtu.be/JC6Q8dHTTCo](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://youtu.be/JC6Q8dHTTCo)



**Try the App:** You can access the tool here: 🔗[**https://neocodebinary.github.io/vrtherapy/**](https://neocodebinary.github.io/vrtherapy/)



**What's next?** I am currently working on native versions for the **App Store and Google Play** to reach more people (these will also be free). The project has an optional ""Buy me a coffee"" button if anyone wants to support the development, but it is completely optional. The tool is fully functional for free.

I sincerely hope this can help you or your loved ones in their recovery journey. Please let me know if you have any feedback!

Special thanks to the moderators for allowing me to post this here.",1,1767721627.0,stroke,0,1.0,False

Let’s say this street.  Lots of foot traffic.  Lots of characters to observe.  Litterbugs included.  That’s always a fun chore.  Keeping the streets clean.  No rest for the wicked I guess.

Sometimes vehicles post up.  Which.  Ya know.  I’m a creative-minded person.  So my brain overworks.  Overtime.  All the time.

Nothing to see.  Everything to see.

Unless you’re on isolated lockdown (you’re not).  Kay.  I mean criminally.  No nothing.  Just death.  Sorry- WiFi not included.

We’re never alone.  Sure.  We live alone.  And that’s its own thing.  Pretty cool.  Sometimes it’s overwhelming.

Not here to shout a distress call; rather, you’re not alone.  Sometimes it’s frantic.  Eerie in its paranoia the lonely night breeze howls.  But just for a moment or two.  Then it’s quiet.  Peaceful in its meaning.  Somehow.  In ways we cannot fully comprehend.  But so what.  lol.  Like that’s ever stopped us before.  From believing.  In birds.  Or bees.  Or Bob the Builder.

Go.  Be alone.  Build a puzzle.  Nurture some plants.  Eat a bowl of cereal you’ve never ate but always wanted to try.

I mean.

I see alot of a lot.  Mostly what I’m noticing is life is a choice.  Even though sometimes we may get frightened by living.  Crazy that is.  In the best ways possible.

I’m finding when I’m honest.  Accountable.  It’s a pleasant blend of attitude.  Seems to be infectious.  Positive.  Yoda would be happy, he would.  Use the force as you might.  Just.  Use that sucker.  It’s not like making enchiladas.  Its effort.  Discipline.  All that good stuff.

In case you have seen me in any sub and would like to get to know me, my DMs are open and available. Finding people in dating is hard, so here I am. I'm always respectful in my messages and I hope you will be the same. Anyway, here is my post:



I've learned how to be happy by myself, but I think some moments are meant to be shared.

Hey. There is a lot I could say about myself, but the most important is that I'm well-rounded. I like to build a place of peace and security in my relationships, and also leave enough room for play. I live a quiet life with writing and drawing most days, but recently I've been going on small side quests like to parks and malls.

A relationship with me is an easy one. A bit of flirting, some teasing, challenging each other. A good time to me is a shared book, spending the day at an arcade or café, or just co-oping some game. I know it's good when we can just sit out in nature enjoy each other's presence. I build slow-burn and with intent. If we ever run into bumps, I take some time to think, then always come back ready to listen.


The woman I fall for is passionate, the type who can go on and on about the things she loves. I always find myself falling for the shy and introverted girls with nerdy hobbies and strong values. I'm most drawn to the girl next door type: cute face, slim to athletic build, and a sweet smile with expressive eyes. Not some perfect model, but not just anyone. I fall for someone who is kind to others, is loyal to the ones she loves, and is just as picky as I am on who she lets into her life.

As a side note, Final Fantasy is my favorite series (obviously), and I'm aiming cosplay Cloud in con season. So if you think you can rock a good Tifa, Aerith, or even Yuffie, then you're definitely my type. Bonus points if you can recommend a couples cosplay idea you love. Let's be the ones who inspire others!

So there was this 27 yo guy that invited me to go out for coffee for him. We talked and I had a great time. There were a lot of things that were off after the date though, like how he somehow never had time to take me on a second date, or that he only responded once in the morning and once at night. But he would still talk to me enough to keep me engaged. I had already lost interest and moved on until last week. He showed up again and told me we should go on another date. We set the time, and poof. 3 hours before the time he cancelled on me because of “work”. On a Sunday. 

So naturally I felt something was really off and after 2 and a half months, I finally decided to literally google him. And it didn’t even take me that long to find his work instagram and then a page her wife has of them documenting their dates… I do not know how to feel. The only thing going on in my head is that if only I had done my research when I first started talking to him, I wouldn’t feel this sick right now. I can’t believe I’ve shared intimate pictures and videos with a married man and I feel really guilty. 

This makes me feel like all I deserve is to be tricked and deceived. I guess my real question here is how do I avoid getting into situations like this again, and… should I reach out to his wife and let her know?  ",2,1767721361.0,internetparents,4,1.0,False

1q5p9ju,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1q5p9ju/disappointed_with_vv/,Disappointed with VV,"Currently on Scarlet Lady, and I have been sorely disappointed . To start off, our shower door doesn’t completely seal at the bottom so it creates an absolute mess. A towel can’t even stop the floor from becoming a pond. We made a call to guest services the first day about it along with the issue of our shower drain seemingly being clogged. They did fix the drain but there wasn’t anything they could really do about the door.

All restaurants take way too much time to experience. I made all 5:30pm reservations and was always cutting it close to making the 7:30pm show. Refills on drinks were very rare or came when we already finished our meal. The soda machine in the galley is basically flat and a bit watered down.

Also, when we arrived on the ship we had a paper with my husband’s name on it, explaining our deep blue extras including a $100 bar tab, laundry service, 2 specialty coffees a day, and a few more. We couldn’t find the $100 bar tab in his Virgin account, so we went to guest services. They said it was a mistake, it was supposed to be put in a different room, and that it’s only for people who have sailed 5x. That’s a pretty big mistake to have printed his name onto the paper. My husband was hoping we’d be offered the $100 bar tab for their mistake, but were offered a bottle of wine. My husband would have used a free $100 bar tab, but I don’t drink, so he was hoping they could offer something we both could benefit from. They ended up giving us a complimentary “Treat Yourself” selection at any restaurant.

Ordered the Grand Plateau at The Wake and used the complimentary Treat Yourself for it. Menu says it includes a whole maine lobster and snow crab claws. Got no claws and the “whole maine lobster” was just a tail. I didn’t care that much because it was still more than enough food, but the menu is misleading/incorrect. The manager of The Wake messaged me about how my experience was afterwards and mentioned the lobster/snow crab dilemma. He messaged back saying that “the lobster dish is only a half portion”. Menu needs to be edited if that’s the case. I would said something in the restaurant during dinner, but since it was complimentary I didn’t feel like causing a problem.

Scarlet Night was disappointing and way overhyped.

The one day, we decided we would skip having our room ne attended to because we wanted to take a nap. We turned on Do Not Disturb on our door, and took our nap. Unfortunately, we were woken up by our room phone being called and asking us when we would be out of our room so they can do their service. I do understand their possibly concern of us complaining if we don’t get our room cleaned up, but we turned on do not disturb for a reason so we could rest, knowing we’d be missing our bed being made that day. At that point, we were already awake so we just said we’d leave in 20 minutes.

The Lolz Supper club comedy was great, but the food was god awful. I ordered my steak medium, it was burnt and I’ve never had a steak that was so chewy. All the restaurant food has been extremely mediocre except for breakfast/brunch at The Wake.

So far, we have only seen BOOKED! because Persephone isn’t until tonight, but the production was amazing. Murray Sawchuck’s magic/comedy show is fantastic as well. We even went to see it twice.

Overall, out of all the ships I’ve been on (MSC, RC, VV), this has for sure been my least favorite. While staff was kind here, the staff on the other ships go above and beyond. This experience has made me want to rebook with MSC …",18,1767721230.0,Cruise,32,0.88,False

1q5p8tm,https://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/1q5p8tm/advice_concerning_identification_of_scammers/,advice concerning identification of scammers,"hey,

everyone of us has probably matched at least one fake account so far in their OLD ""career"". personally i have talked to quite a few of them and i recently noticed a difference in their appearance or style of writing. their general approach is still to move the conversation to a different platform asap, for example whatsapp. 

for reference: i live in germany in a big city and its not that uncommon that foreign people have a visit or live here  
  
here are some typical red flags (can be wildly mixed together):

* very low information in the profile and/or bio
* empty bio except a tacky sentence like ""the secret to happiness is laughing""
* artificially looking generic photos
* photos of chinese or at least asian models
* no reference in any shape or form to the current city or location whatsoever
* bad english with some uncommonly used words here and there (uncommon especially in the context of weak language skills in the first place)
* spelling mistakes like ""whtspp"" instead of ""whatsapp"" (really weird!)
* ""i am with my aunt now""
* ""im from australia, currently in london but next week we can have a coffee, ill be there"", sure
* occupation: accountant, business owner, something with finance, beauty salon
* anything with crypto (including occupation or hobby, questions, etc.)
* nearby (can also be an expensive district of the current city)
* unexpected request for giving the number which totally broke the flow of the conversation and/or is based on bad reasoning

those are quite blatant. but recently i noticed that the blatancy decreased: the pictures look quite normal and not as model like as they used to. the spelling mistakes are gone. they ask normal questions and react accordingly. they still ask for numbers after a short conversation, also twice at times after declining (which is one more red flags on its own!). the bios are still suspicously empty and generic

now my personal advice on how to not fall for any scam in OLD ever:

1. ask things about your city or location. for example ""whats your district youre living in and do you like it?"". the scammers can google a district or be prepared in the first place, but youll notice quickly if the persons really know what they are talking about. i often times got into a nice conversation with real people because of it
2. ask people for a meeting up asap, this way its sometimes not even needed to share numbers, because eventually you could share them IRL anyways. scammers hate this, theyll try to convince you to really give it to you after declining and suggesting a meet up. no sane real person would do this
3. dont be desperate. OLD can be frustrating at times and scammers use this to their advantage. the more desperate you are, the more likely it is that youll convince yourself of believing a person is genuine when its clearly not or at least suspicious

maybe not a general rule or trick, but in all my years of OLD i never got asked for a number in the first place, it was the other way around (or at least i cant remember). on okc in particular girls get many messages per day and the chance that theyll ask for it first is per se a lot lower

1q5p4q7,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1q5p4q7/time_looped_chapter_182/,[Time Looped] - Chapter 182,"All motion ceased. As far as the eye could see, the whole of reality stopped still, with two exceptions. 

“It never gets old,” Alex said. “Thanks again for helping me get this. Wasn’t what I intended, but it has its uses.”

Will remained silent.

“I’ll start first.” The goofball looked at him. “What exactly did Danny say when you killed him?”

“I didn’t kill him,” Will insisted. “I just removed him from eternity.”

“Same difference. When we’re removed from eternity, we die.” There was a momentary sharpness in the thief’s voice. “Don’t feel bad, bro.” He smiled, changing his tone again. “He killed me as well. Best-case scenario, the person who was me is probably in a nuthouse somewhere. I hope someone in the family has coughed up the cash, otherwise it’ll be hell of uncomfortable.”

There was no way of knowing whether Alex was guilting Will into helping or outright threatening him. Based on the pieces of information Will had pieced together, his classmate had been of the same power level as the original archer. Lucia, Danny, Ely, and even Jess shared that view. Even now, with a severe skill downgrade and part of his memories missing, he was likely stronger than anyone Will had come into contact with.

The rogue had every reason to end the prediction loop here. It wasn’t linked to the time freeze, and Alex had no defense against it. Playing along, though, could provide some interesting information.

“He said that I messed up everything,” Will repeated the words that were etched into his mind. “Something about there being other monsters and only he could find them.”

There was no reaction from Alex. The thief didn’t laugh or curse, he didn’t even change expression, looking at Will as if he was watching a movie for the seventh time in a row.

“Just that?”

“Just that.” Will replied. “During the fight he asked whether I worked for the tamer,” he continued, trying to obtain some information in response. “The necromancer or the bard. Who are they?”

“Just classes.” The thief didn’t flinch. “Powerful classes.”

“I thought that all classes were powerful.”

“So, you’ve been keeping up with eternity gossip,” Alex smiled. “Keep at it, bro. You’ll become a pro in no time. For real,” he added mockingly. “These are nastier. They rely on others doing the work for them.”

“I thought the mage was the worst.”

“Just because he restarted the phase?”

“Spenser said so…” Will hesitated. “When we came upon a reflection of him.”

“Another reflection.” The thief sighed. “I hate those. And yeah, the old mage was scary. The last of the old guard. Well, the old guard during my time. Most of the loopers you see now are new. They talk a big game, but they’re just like you. Spenser, the lancer, the acrobat… Gabriel’s little sister.”

The thief reached into his pocket to take out a muffin, but the cloth refused to move. The time freeze had affected even that. Curious, the boy took a step forward. His trousers bent as normal.

“Was that what you called me here for?” Will asked.

“Sorry, bro. Was hoping you’d know more. “He shrugged. “Big ooof, I guess. He laughed. Seriously, that’s just a part. I want to offer you an alliance.”

The word hit Will like a scorching coal. In the past, whenever someone had used it, things had turned out poorly.

“A loose alliance,” Alex quickly corrected. “No fragment freezing, no threats, no unbreakable bonds. I’m offering to work on a strict principle of mutual benefit.”

“I help you, you help me?”

“There’s a bit of that.” The goofball nodded. “But not a lot. You’re cool, but I don’t trust you. And I know that you’ll never trust me. Think of it as working towards a common goal. Both of us want to reach the end of eternity without dying in the process.”

“That’s a bit vague.”

“Vague works best. Keeps you on your toes. If I wanted a minion, I’d just have hired one of the mercs. All of them are better than you in every possible way.”

That hurt, even if the boy was right. Spenser and the lancer were the only two “mercenaries” Will was familiar with, and indeed, both of them would win if it came to a fight.

“Why me?”

“You’re the rogue. You have the drive. If the class was still mine, I wouldn’t bother, but right now I’m stuck with you, bro. And I don’t want to wait half of eternity for someone else to fill your slot.”

*All heart*, Will thought. He missed the previous version of Alex. Even if not always there, at least that one was always fun. This one seemed like a walking block of ice.

“If I agree, how does this work?” Will tested the waters.

“Good question.” The thief pointed at him. “Most of it will be doing what you promised you’d help me with, before.”

Will blinked.

“Danny’s psycho file,” Alex said, seeing his friend’s confusion. “We started going through the notes, remember? Well, I didn’t have all my thoughts straight, and there was always something urgent happening, so I wasn’t able to learn much.” He paused. “Okay, I haven’t been able to learn anything new since then, either, but you will.”

“You’re still on about that?” Anticlimactic was a polite way to say what Will thought of the request. “What’s the point? Danny’s dead *and* ejected from eternity.” Suddenly, a terrifying thought came to mind. “Is he back?”

“Nah, bro, chill.” Alex laughed. “Danny’s gone. But I was never searching for info on him, anyway.” He took a few steps towards Will. “I just wanted to know what he’d seen and where he’d been.”

“Why?” *Damn you, Alex!*

Despite himself, Will felt intrigued by the new direction of the conversation. From what he could remember, some of Danny’s “dreams” were pretty wild. At the time, he believed them to be a coping mechanism—a way for him to vent over the frustrations and confusion that eternity had brought into his life. If Alex were to be believed, maybe the notes were to be taken a lot more literally. The scribblings on the school desk had provided a lot of useful information about the tutorial phase. The sessions with mister June, the school counselor, could prove to contain further information regarding eternity in general.

“Don’t play me, bro.” Alex shook his head.

“You’re worried about the tamer, the necromancer, and the bard?”

“Maybe,” the thief remained as evasive as ever. “They sound like trouble, but they’re not the biggest problem. Do you know the story of those that came before?”

Going by the odds, Will likely would get the best advantage if he replied with a maybe. That wasn’t his style, though. Being a fence-sitter wasn’t going to get him anything now.

“Not much,” he said in a decisive tone. “I know that they were as strong as rankers and then suddenly disappeared.”

“The strongest rankers,” Will corrected. “Perma skills, ranker skills, legendary gear, and all sorts of other goodies. And yet they aren’t here anymore.”

“I guess they flew too close to the sun of eternity.”

“Good one, bro.” Alex laughed again. “The story always gets a few new wrinkles every thousand loops, but the question remains. Why did they vanish?”

“I thought you’d know that better than anyone.” Will felt slightly guilty in pointing it out. “The same happened to you and the archer.”

“Yeah, yeah.” The thief waved his hand in boredom. “The same old story. They got too powerful, fought against one another until they were all cast out. The question remains, though. Why? Did all of them spontaneously get greedy? And if so, why? Did eternity demand it? Was it some sort of challenge requirement?”

Will could see his friend’s point. It was all too easy to claim that the first participants had killed each other. It was a simple explanation that made everyone else feel safe and stop searching further. Maybe there really was some final event? A limit at which eternity reset itself? Even loops seemed all the same until a hundred of them passed. Then, people get to learn about the phases. What if there was an even greater change after a hundred phases?

“You feel it, don’t you?” Alex asked in envy. “The need to get to the bottom of it. I don’t even remember how long ago I lost my rogue class, but I still feel the echo of curiosity. It’s in me like an itch that I must scratch.”

“And we do that by learning more about Danny’s past,” Will noted.

“He was the last rogue. He probably found out something before that. It’s the only reason he’d kill me to claim my class.”

*Or maybe that’s the thief’s nature,* Will thought. Several people had warned him against betrayals, especially coming from Alex.

“So, how will this work? We get together in the coffee shop to go through the notes?”

“No.” Alex shook his head. “Too many people, too many mirrors. For the moment, just keep an eye out. If you hear or see anything relating to the first batch, let me know.”

“Got you. What about the tamer, the necromancer, and the bard? If they’re so dangerous, won’t they be doing the same?”

“I bet they are. The trick when dealing with powerful bastards is not to let them know you’re worth their time. That might be difficult for you with all the attention you’ve gathered.”

“You’re pretty famous yourself.”

“Nah, bro.” Alex waved a finger. “The old Alex is. I’m just a crazy imitation of the original. They keep their eye on me, but none of them see me as a threat.”

“You’re sure?”

“Bro, if I were, I’d be dead.” Certainty mixed with icy coldness. “And just to make sure, don’t tell this to anyone, even Helen.”

“There’s nothing going on between us.”

Will would be lying if part of him didn’t hope that there was. As a knight, all the girl needed was a sign to spend the rest of eternity by his side, protecting him from any and all dangers. The worst part was that all the boy had to do was use some of his rogue charm to make it happen. Yet, he knew that if he did that, he’d just be leading her. The paradox loop had changed a lot of things, including Will’s view of people, eternity, and especially those he had been close to. Alex had ceased to be the close, goofy friend he had been in the past, Jace wasn’t an enemy or rival, and Helen… things with Helen were complicated, but any budding romance had been ripped out at the roots.

“Then, it shouldn’t be a problem,” Alex said unapologetically. “Play along, but keep her out of it. Being too close to a knight is always a double-edged sword.”

*You should know.* “Sure.” Will didn’t bat an eye. “Why didn’t you tell me this earlier?”

“Not to be close to dangerous girls?” Alex blinked. In the entire conversation so far, this was the first time he had been caught off guard.

“About the first batch.”

“My memories weren’t all there, bro.”

“I’m not talking about that. Why didn’t you tell me after I ejected Danny? Still don’t trust me?”

“Sorry, bro. I still don’t trust you, or anyone else, in eternity. We’re having this talk now, because there wasn’t any point in doing it earlier. Without a reward phase, there was nothing we could do.”

The realization struck Will like a lightning bolt.

“You want us to become rankers.”

“Info’s useless otherwise. We can only get closer to eternity then. Oh, and better skill up by then. I don’t want you to be losing in the contest phase.”

“Look who’s talking.” Will crossed his arms.

“Fair. Fair.” The thief smirked. “By the way, just because I don’t trust you, doesn’t mean I don’t like you. Bro’s forever, bro!” The smirk turned into a smile, and as far as Will could determine there was a chance that it even might be genuine. “And to prove it, I’ll leave you with another question.” He went up to Will, leaning in to whisper into his ear. “If.”

“If?”

“Are all the first participants out of the picture? The mage claimed to be one, or close to them. What if there really is someone who stayed behind?”

1q5p2rs,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1q5p2rs/time_looped_chapter_182/,Time Looped (Chapter 182),"All motion ceased. As far as the eye could see, the whole of reality stopped still, with two exceptions. 

“It never gets old,” Alex said. “Thanks again for helping me get this. Wasn’t what I intended, but it has its uses.”

Will remained silent.

“I’ll start first.” The goofball looked at him. “What exactly did Danny say when you killed him?”

“I didn’t kill him,” Will insisted. “I just removed him from eternity.”

“Same difference. When we’re removed from eternity, we die.” There was a momentary sharpness in the thief’s voice. “Don’t feel bad, bro.” He smiled, changing his tone again. “He killed me as well. Best-case scenario, the person who was me is probably in a nuthouse somewhere. I hope someone in the family has coughed up the cash, otherwise it’ll be hell of uncomfortable.”

There was no way of knowing whether Alex was guilting Will into helping or outright threatening him. Based on the pieces of information Will had pieced together, his classmate had been of the same power level as the original archer. Lucia, Danny, Ely, and even Jess shared that view. Even now, with a severe skill downgrade and part of his memories missing, he was likely stronger than anyone Will had come into contact with.

The rogue had every reason to end the prediction loop here. It wasn’t linked to the time freeze, and Alex had no defense against it. Playing along, though, could provide some interesting information.

“He said that I messed up everything,” Will repeated the words that were etched into his mind. “Something about there being other monsters and only he could find them.”

There was no reaction from Alex. The thief didn’t laugh or curse, he didn’t even change expression, looking at Will as if he was watching a movie for the seventh time in a row.

“Just that?”

“Just that.” Will replied. “During the fight he asked whether I worked for the tamer,” he continued, trying to obtain some information in response. “The necromancer or the bard. Who are they?”

“Just classes.” The thief didn’t flinch. “Powerful classes.”

“I thought that all classes were powerful.”

“So, you’ve been keeping up with eternity gossip,” Alex smiled. “Keep at it, bro. You’ll become a pro in no time. For real,” he added mockingly. “These are nastier. They rely on others doing the work for them.”

“I thought the mage was the worst.”

“Just because he restarted the phase?”

“Spenser said so…” Will hesitated. “When we came upon a reflection of him.”

“Another reflection.” The thief sighed. “I hate those. And yeah, the old mage was scary. The last of the old guard. Well, the old guard during my time. Most of the loopers you see now are new. They talk a big game, but they’re just like you. Spenser, the lancer, the acrobat… Gabriel’s little sister.”

The thief reached into his pocket to take out a muffin, but the cloth refused to move. The time freeze had affected even that. Curious, the boy took a step forward. His trousers bent as normal.

“Was that what you called me here for?” Will asked.

“Sorry, bro. Was hoping you’d know more. “He shrugged. “Big ooof, I guess. He laughed. Seriously, that’s just a part. I want to offer you an alliance.”

The word hit Will like a scorching coal. In the past, whenever someone had used it, things had turned out poorly.

“A loose alliance,” Alex quickly corrected. “No fragment freezing, no threats, no unbreakable bonds. I’m offering to work on a strict principle of mutual benefit.”

“I help you, you help me?”

“There’s a bit of that.” The goofball nodded. “But not a lot. You’re cool, but I don’t trust you. And I know that you’ll never trust me. Think of it as working towards a common goal. Both of us want to reach the end of eternity without dying in the process.”

“That’s a bit vague.”

“Vague works best. Keeps you on your toes. If I wanted a minion, I’d just have hired one of the mercs. All of them are better than you in every possible way.”

That hurt, even if the boy was right. Spenser and the lancer were the only two “mercenaries” Will was familiar with, and indeed, both of them would win if it came to a fight.

“Why me?”

“You’re the rogue. You have the drive. If the class was still mine, I wouldn’t bother, but right now I’m stuck with you, bro. And I don’t want to wait half of eternity for someone else to fill your slot.”

*All heart*, Will thought. He missed the previous version of Alex. Even if not always there, at least that one was always fun. This one seemed like a walking block of ice.

“If I agree, how does this work?” Will tested the waters.

“Good question.” The thief pointed at him. “Most of it will be doing what you promised you’d help me with, before.”

Will blinked.

“Danny’s psycho file,” Alex said, seeing his friend’s confusion. “We started going through the notes, remember? Well, I didn’t have all my thoughts straight, and there was always something urgent happening, so I wasn’t able to learn much.” He paused. “Okay, I haven’t been able to learn anything new since then, either, but you will.”

“You’re still on about that?” Anticlimactic was a polite way to say what Will thought of the request. “What’s the point? Danny’s dead *and* ejected from eternity.” Suddenly, a terrifying thought came to mind. “Is he back?”

“Nah, bro, chill.” Alex laughed. “Danny’s gone. But I was never searching for info on him, anyway.” He took a few steps towards Will. “I just wanted to know what he’d seen and where he’d been.”

“Why?” *Damn you, Alex!*

Despite himself, Will felt intrigued by the new direction of the conversation. From what he could remember, some of Danny’s “dreams” were pretty wild. At the time, he believed them to be a coping mechanism—a way for him to vent over the frustrations and confusion that eternity had brought into his life. If Alex were to be believed, maybe the notes were to be taken a lot more literally. The scribblings on the school desk had provided a lot of useful information about the tutorial phase. The sessions with mister June, the school counselor, could prove to contain further information regarding eternity in general.

“Don’t play me, bro.” Alex shook his head.

“You’re worried about the tamer, the necromancer, and the bard?”

“Maybe,” the thief remained as evasive as ever. “They sound like trouble, but they’re not the biggest problem. Do you know the story of those that came before?”

Going by the odds, Will likely would get the best advantage if he replied with a maybe. That wasn’t his style, though. Being a fence-sitter wasn’t going to get him anything now.

“Not much,” he said in a decisive tone. “I know that they were as strong as rankers and then suddenly disappeared.”

“The strongest rankers,” Will corrected. “Perma skills, ranker skills, legendary gear, and all sorts of other goodies. And yet they aren’t here anymore.”

“I guess they flew too close to the sun of eternity.”

“Good one, bro.” Alex laughed again. “The story always gets a few new wrinkles every thousand loops, but the question remains. Why did they vanish?”

“I thought you’d know that better than anyone.” Will felt slightly guilty in pointing it out. “The same happened to you and the archer.”

“Yeah, yeah.” The thief waved his hand in boredom. “The same old story. They got too powerful, fought against one another until they were all cast out. The question remains, though. Why? Did all of them spontaneously get greedy? And if so, why? Did eternity demand it? Was it some sort of challenge requirement?”

Will could see his friend’s point. It was all too easy to claim that the first participants had killed each other. It was a simple explanation that made everyone else feel safe and stop searching further. Maybe there really was some final event? A limit at which eternity reset itself? Even loops seemed all the same until a hundred of them passed. Then, people get to learn about the phases. What if there was an even greater change after a hundred phases?

“You feel it, don’t you?” Alex asked in envy. “The need to get to the bottom of it. I don’t even remember how long ago I lost my rogue class, but I still feel the echo of curiosity. It’s in me like an itch that I must scratch.”

“And we do that by learning more about Danny’s past,” Will noted.

“He was the last rogue. He probably found out something before that. It’s the only reason he’d kill me to claim my class.”

*Or maybe that’s the thief’s nature,* Will thought. Several people had warned him against betrayals, especially coming from Alex.

“So, how will this work? We get together in the coffee shop to go through the notes?”

“No.” Alex shook his head. “Too many people, too many mirrors. For the moment, just keep an eye out. If you hear or see anything relating to the first batch, let me know.”

“Got you. What about the tamer, the necromancer, and the bard? If they’re so dangerous, won’t they be doing the same?”

“I bet they are. The trick when dealing with powerful bastards is not to let them know you’re worth their time. That might be difficult for you with all the attention you’ve gathered.”

“You’re pretty famous yourself.”

“Nah, bro.” Alex waved a finger. “The old Alex is. I’m just a crazy imitation of the original. They keep their eye on me, but none of them see me as a threat.”

“You’re sure?”

“Bro, if I were, I’d be dead.” Certainty mixed with icy coldness. “And just to make sure, don’t tell this to anyone, even Helen.”

“There’s nothing going on between us.”

Will would be lying if part of him didn’t hope that there was. As a knight, all the girl needed was a sign to spend the rest of eternity by his side, protecting him from any and all dangers. The worst part was that all the boy had to do was use some of his rogue charm to make it happen. Yet, he knew that if he did that, he’d just be leading her. The paradox loop had changed a lot of things, including Will’s view of people, eternity, and especially those he had been close to. Alex had ceased to be the close, goofy friend he had been in the past, Jace wasn’t an enemy or rival, and Helen… things with Helen were complicated, but any budding romance had been ripped out at the roots.

“Then, it shouldn’t be a problem,” Alex said unapologetically. “Play along, but keep her out of it. Being too close to a knight is always a double-edged sword.”

*You should know.* “Sure.” Will didn’t bat an eye. “Why didn’t you tell me this earlier?”

“Not to be close to dangerous girls?” Alex blinked. In the entire conversation so far, this was the first time he had been caught off guard.

“About the first batch.”

“My memories weren’t all there, bro.”

“I’m not talking about that. Why didn’t you tell me after I ejected Danny? Still don’t trust me?”

“Sorry, bro. I still don’t trust you, or anyone else, in eternity. We’re having this talk now, because there wasn’t any point in doing it earlier. Without a reward phase, there was nothing we could do.”

The realization struck Will like a lightning bolt.

“You want us to become rankers.”

“Info’s useless otherwise. We can only get closer to eternity then. Oh, and better skill up by then. I don’t want you to be losing in the contest phase.”

“Look who’s talking.” Will crossed his arms.

“Fair. Fair.” The thief smirked. “By the way, just because I don’t trust you, doesn’t mean I don’t like you. Bro’s forever, bro!” The smirk turned into a smile, and as far as Will could determine there was a chance that it even might be genuine. “And to prove it, I’ll leave you with another question.” He went up to Will, leaning in to whisper into his ear. “If.”

“If?”

“Are all the first participants out of the picture? The mage claimed to be one, or close to them. What if there really is someone who stayed behind?”

Honestly, yeah.
It’d be nice if the online systems just went:
“Oh—you’re confused, stressed, or dealing with something broken?
Here. Talk to this guy.”
But nope. Instead it’s… vibes, algorithms, and shouting.

I still don’t know how any of this turns into contracts.

Routing infrastructure is not.

Current online systems optimize for:

They do not optimize for:

It came from:

I am in a bit of a tricky situation and the clover support team has been the least helpful support team I have ever dealt with. 

I have been working at this coffee shop since 2023 and ended up purchasing the shop in October of 2025. In the summer of 2024, my former bosses switched our POS system to Clover. When I took over the shop, I was told it would be an easy process to switch the device we currently had over to the new business. 

This is where our issues begin. Not only did the representative sign the clover application using my name without my permission. Then Clover decided that we needed a new Clover Mini for the transfer. Our machine came in and despite having a few issues regarding the cash discount portion of clover, it was fine.

Fast forward to the week before Christmas 2025. Clover gives us a call asking if our representatives have reached out at any point recently. We say no and are promptly placed on hold. Once off the hold, they ask us if we had any issues using the device. We mentioned the cash discount program being funky and we are placed on another hold. This goes back and forth for a while. Several transfers and holds later, we are told that we are receiving ANOTHER new Clover Mini.  They gave no explanation as to why they were sending it, they just did. This call went on for an hour and a half. 

We received the new device Monday January 5th, but my partner and I agreed to end the services with clover as we have several issues in the year and a half we have been using them. 

When we called to cancel they claimed we had 39 months left on our contract and it would be $6,000 to terminate it. What can we do? Would the representative signing on my behalf without permission be enough to terminate the contract?  Does each device come with a new 36 month contract on addition to whatever amount was left on the original device? 

Thanks for any help you may have! I am tired of fighting with Clover. ",1,1767720250.0,CloverPOS,4,1.0,False

The apartment is a mess. Clothes are strewn across the bed, some on the floor. Half empty pizza boxes and old Chinese takeout containers litter the coffee table. The sink is filled with dishes that have been there for days. The leaky faucet in the kitchen drips steadily. It’s a metronome counting out the seconds in the otherwise silent room. I wake up on the couch with a blanket tangled around my legs. The faint smell of stale beer and cigarette smoke hangs in the air. My head pounds in a reminder of the whiskey I downed last night while watching old reruns of westerns. I didn’t work last night, never on Sundays.

I light a cigarette. The first drag clears some of the fog from my brain. I check my phone expecting to see a string of missed calls or messages. Nothing. I toss the phone onto the coffee table and head to the bathroom where the cold water from the faucet does little to wake me up.

I get ready for work. The familiar routine feels comforting in its monotony. I skip the shave but I brush my teeth. I splash some water on my face in an attempt to wash away last night. I pull on a clean shirt, the collar stiff against my neck. I put on pants that are enough to be presentable. Now that I’m good to go, I lock up my apartment, get into my car and I head into town.

My office is downtown. A small space above a pawn shop. It's not much but it's mine. The inside is just as homely as my apartment. Papers and folders strewn across every surface. A full ashtray sits on the edge of my desk. Dust on the bookshelves thick enough to write my name in. Old crime novels and police memorabilia from my days on the force line the shelves.

I grab the full ashtray and dump its contents into an already filled waste-bin beside my desk and toss it back. I sit down at my desk hearing the leather chair creaking under my weight. Nothing out of the norm besides the answering machine blinking. A single message waiting for me. I hit the playback button letting the tape whir to life.

*""Mr. Hall, this is Linda Harper. My daughter Emily… she's been having nightmares. She says there's a man in a hat watching her sleep. I thought it was just a bad dream but she's been like this for days. She won't sleep. She's so tired. Please, can you help us?""*

I play it back again noting the woman's voice tight with fear and desperation. I pull the Reid folder out of the filing cabinet. The Hat Man. Stalking children in their bedrooms. It's not a coincidence. It can't be. I recognize the name Linda Harper. The girl with the pigtails, the one who stared at me from her bike, that’s her daughter. And she's been one of his victims too.

Anger surges through me hot and sudden. I grip the folder, the paper crumpling under my fingers. I force myself to let go before I created permanent creases. I log the voicemail in my note pad and store the call-back number into my cellphone. I grab my jacket, the one I left on the back of my chair God knows how many days ago. I open a drawer in my desk and I check for my gun. It’s bad practice I know, but I keep it in my office this way for easy access. I holster it. I brush up a few papers on my desk into a pile to maintain some order and then I leave. I need a better place to think.

———

With the morning rush over, the diner is quiet. Marge is behind the counter, wiping down the formica with a rag. She looks up as I enter, her eyes taking in my rumpled clothes and unshaven face. I take a seat on one of the high-tops.

""Rough night?"" she asks, pouring me a cup of coffee without waiting for an answer.

""If I could remember. I'd probably tell you all the details,"" I mutter taking a sip. The coffee is hot and bitter just the way I like it.

Marge sympathizes, her eyes softening. ""You look like you need it,"" she says walking away to tend to another customer.

I notice a man sitting a few seats from me holding a newspaper spread out in front of him. The headline catches my eye: *""Have You Seen This Person?""* A sketch of a dark figure with a top hat perched on his head. I get up and walk to him and grabbed the paper from the man's hands. He looks up startled, but I just nod at him. A silent thanks. I scan the article all while the words blurred together.

*""Mysterious man in all black reported breaking into houses and scaring children. If you see this man call the police immediately.""*

I gently give the paper back to the man as a bitter laugh escapes my lips. The cops can't even solve the problem. They're chasing ghosts just like I am. But I'm not going to let this sicko get away. Not on my watch.

I drop a few ones on the table. Should be enough to cover the coffee and the tip. Marge nods at me as I leave. I get in my car and start the engine. I start driving to anywhere that could make sense, the city streets a blur around me. I need to think. I need to plan.

I pull out my phone and pull up the number from the voicemail. Linda Harper. I hit the call button and she answers on the second ring.

""Mr. Hall?""

""It's me,"" I say, my voice gruff. ""I'll check in on your place tonight. Keep the doors locked and the windows closed. And keep an eye on Emily. If you see anything, anything at all, call me. Day or night.""

I hang up and slipped the phone back into my jacket pocket. I ponder to myself that if this sicko likes watching kids sleep so much I wonder what he does in the daytime. Might be harassing kids in other ways. I look at the radio’s clock, it's roughly noon. I decide to head to the elementary school. I park on the street that lines the gated playground area. I roll down the window to let in some fresh air and I light a cigarette.

The school bell rings. The sound echos through the air. Kids pour out of the building with their laughter filling the playground. This must be their recess time. I watch them, scanning the crowd with my eyes. Leo is there, his face pale and drawn. The girl with the pigtails, Emily, is with him. Her eyes red from lack of sleep. They're not playing. They’re just standing off to the side.

I make a note in my notepad. *Exhausted. Standoffish. Other kids affected too?* I count out roughly ten more with faces and body language similar to Leo and Emily’s. They must all be victims too of the Hat Man.

The school bell rings again signaling the end of recess. The kids file back into the building. Their voices faded away. I'm about to start the car when I hear another engine revving to life. I look in the rearview mirror, my eyes narrowing as I see a car further down the street, facing the opposite direction. Smoke puffs out of the cars exhaust and the sound of the engine becomes a low rumble.

I can vaguely make out the back of the head of the person in the driver's seat and the dark brim of a top hat. My heart pounds in my chest, adrenaline surging through my veins. Did he come here to watch the kids? I got you asshole.

I wait with my eyes fixed on the car. I can't let him get away. Not again. I start my car and I wait for him to drive off while tapping my fingers against the steering wheel. And then finally, he moves. The car pulls away.

I make a U-turn, my tires screeching against the pavement. I follow him. My eyes never leaving him. The Hat Man drives through the streets, his route seemingly random. I stay back, far enough that he won't notice me, but close enough that I won't lose him. We weave through the city. And then, suddenly, he turns into the parking lot of Shoppette Plus. One of the local grocery stores within the town.

I roughly pressed on the brakes, double checking that the Hat Man wasn’t trying to lose me through the parking lot. My heart pounded in my chest. I drive forward a bit more to a second entrance to the lot. As I pull in I see the Hat Man parking in an open spot. I quickly find my own at a good distance to not be seen. I park, and then I get out of the car, my gun in my hand. 

I stoop low nervously outside my car watching the back-end of the Hat Man’s car. The grip on my gun tightening. He steps out. A black void of nothing dawning a long jacket that hid his feet. His hat towering over his thin stature. What is he doing here? I slowly move down an aisle, my eyes transfixed on the Hat Man’s location. He was walking towards the store. What is going on?

I cut over through an aisle of cars. Holding my breath trying to stay as quiet as possible. I watch the Hat Man casually walk to a corral of shopping carts at the stores entrance. He grabs a cart. Cold sweat dripped down the side of my face as I watched him stroll past the entrance through the sliding doors. Is the hatman grocery shopping?",2,1767720041.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I live in England and have been passionate about coffee for about 15 years.  
been drinking "" good "" Espresso for about 5 years and the last 12 month started to drink mainly pour over.

buy from a whole range of roasters, crank house, Sweven, the source, Dak, Sey, Manhattan, Casa coffee, Django etc.

for people who have been in a similar position to me, how quickly were you able to produce coffee that's up to your standard?

what literature/ media helped you in the process?

and what coffee did you start with, I drink mainly light roasted coffee but I do also drink dark and mediums when I have the occasional espresso or flat white, from all different origins and processing methods, anything from washed coffees and naturals to thermal shock double anaerobic yeast inoculated coffees.  

I say all this because the greens I've been seeing are still pretty pricey in comparison to roasted coffee and I assume that is due to batch size but could be wrong, I've mainly looked at falcon micro and green coffee collective. Diego Bermudez beans seemed to be almost half the price however.

also for anyone who has this roaster? any reason to go with the gen 2 over the gen 1? that's not already obvious?

1q5onl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/workout/comments/1q5onl9/best_protein_powder_recommendations/,Best Protein Powder Recommendations?,"Hey everyone,

I swear choosing a protein powder is way more annoying than it should be. Every site screams “best ever” and then you scroll the comments and people are like “this wrecked my stomach” or “tastes like drywall”. So I gave up on blogs and figured I’d just ask here.

Quick context so you know where I’m coming from:

* Goal: build a bit of lean muscle, recover better, not chase some crazy stage‑ready body
* Training: normal gym routine, basic lifting + some cardio, nothing elite
* Diet: I try to eat decently, but I’m not that person who meal preps chicken and rice for 5 days straight
* No known allergies, but I’m sensitive to stuff that’s too sweet or fake‑tasting

Right now my brain is stuck between a few options and I honestly don’t know what’s real and what’s just marketing:

* Classic whey concentrate vs isolate — is isolate actually worth the extra money if I’m not shredded or lactose‑intolerant, or is it just a flex?
* Casein at night vs just using the same protein all day and not overthinking it
* Plant‑based proteins (pea/rice blends etc.): people say they’re “easier on the stomach”, but is that actually true for most of you or just a niche thing?

A few questions to stir things up a bit:

* What’s the one protein you could drink every day for a month without wanting to throw the tub out the window? Flavor + brand, please.
* Anyone actually feel a real difference between “simple ingredients, no junk” powders and the dessert‑style ones that taste like melted ice cream but have a chemistry set on the label?
* If your friend who lifts regularly but isn’t super hardcore asked you for one protein recommendation, what would you tell them without overthinking?
* What’s the biggest disappointment you’ve had: great macros on paper, hyped in reviews, and then in real life it clumps, tastes awful, or destroys your stomach?

I’m also curious about how people use it in real life, not in theory:

* Do you rely on powder for a big chunk of your daily protein, or is it more like “I’m short 30g today so I’ll just slam a shake and move on”?
* For those who tried both whey and plant‑based, did you notice anything at all in terms of recovery, energy, hunger, or body comp, or was it basically the same and you just stuck with whatever tasted less terrible?

Feel free to:

* Drop your favorite brand + exact flavor and how you usually take it (water, milk, coffee, oats, smoothies, whatever weird combo you actually use)
* Share unpopular opinions like “this Reddit‑famous protein is actually trash”
* Warn me about beginner mistakes like buying a 2kg tub of something you’ve never tried and then suffering through it because it was expensive

I’m not loyal to any brand yet. Just want something that doesn’t taste like wet cardboard, doesn’t nuke my digestion, and doesn’t cost as much as rent. If you were me, what would you grab first?",2,1767719904.0,workout,2,1.0,False

I’m also a bit of an introvert. I recharge in quiet, meaningful spaces. But if the vibe is right, you’ll see my fun and talkative side 😂

What I’m looking for… A **SINGLE** guy who’s an equally accomplished professional, intelligent, economically secure, respectful, and can start a conversation that goes beyond “hi” and “hello”. Also, **26-37 years old** , someone warm, caring, nice, grounded, endless thoughtful, and just as pleasing to the eyes as the scenery I adore. 

Bonus if you are:
- well dressed: clean, stylish, and just the right amount of classy 👌🏻
- Single. Not in a romantic relationship whatsoever. Never been married. (Best if you can provide a **CENOMAR** when we meet 😂)
- No human kids 
- Christian (genuinely God-fearing)
- Love and/or have dogs
- Enjoy spontaneous long drives
- Can appreciate the charm of bookstores and late-night cafés
- From **Cebu City  or Mandaue City** (easier for coffee dates and spontaneous drives). 
- Not a DDS and BBM supporter

If this sounds like you…
Send me a message and tell me more about yourself such as what do you look like, important aspects in your background, current work, and/or your long-term goals, AND your go-to coffee order too!

Thank you for taking time to read until this point. Kindly include the word cheesecake when you message me so I would know!

Will ignore **ZERO EFFORT** messages! 🙅🏻‍♀️ Puhlease, may effort naman post ko, hope you’ll reciprocate ha 😇

1q5oi2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1q5oi2v/aita_for_being_upset_about_my_boyfriend_labeling/,AITA for being upset about my boyfriend labeling parts of my upbringing as “sad”?,"I’m genuinely trying to check myself here and figure out if I’m overreacting or if my feelings are reasonable.

I (37F) have been dating a man (late 30s M) for a couple of months. Overall, the relationship has been warm, consistent, and affectionate. We talk often, spend a lot of time together, and until now I felt emotionally safe with him.

Here’s where things shifted.

Over time, he’s made several comments that felt judgmental or labeling, especially around my background and upbringing. For example:

	•	When I mentioned drinking coffee as a kid (which is very normal in my culture), he said, “That’s sad to give a kid caffeine.”

	•	He’s made joking comments about where I’m from or how I was raised that felt dismissive.

	•	He’s also labeled me as “corny,” “submissive,” or implied I’m overly agreeable.

Individually, these comments might seem small, but together they started to sting. So I calmly brought it up and said something along the lines of:

“I don’t think you’re trying to hurt me, but when you describe parts of my upbringing as ‘sad,’ it feels judgmental and hurts my feelings. I’m just asking for awareness of how your words land with me.”

I was not asking him to change his beliefs, censor himself completely, or apologize endlessly. Just mindfulness.

His response really surprised me.

Instead of engaging with the specific concern, he shifted the conversation into religion and said things like:

	•	“Only God can judge me.”

	•	That people who feel judged by others need to examine their spirit.

	•	That this made him question whether we were “equally yoked.”

That felt like a huge leap to me, to go from “this comment hurt my feelings” to questioning my spirituality or emotional maturity. I tried to clarify that I wasn’t questioning our compatibility or his faith, and that I didn’t need theological framing, I just wanted to know if he could be mindful of how his words affect me. He did apologize, but continued to frame it as people being too sensitive or needing thicker skin.

Now I feel shocked more than sadness. Am I overreacting for feeling hurt and unsettled by this?",0,1767719575.0,AITA_Relationships,4,0.5,False

Moving really forced me to think about how I use the space day to day and I realized organization matters way more when you’re thinking in terms of years, not months.  
  
What’s helped so far is organizing around habits instead of labels. I grouped things based on routines, like keeping morning coffee items together, cooking tools close to the stove and cleaning supplies easy to grab. I also stopped chasing the idea of perfectly empty counters and focused more on intentional ones. If something gets used often, I’m okay with it staying out as long as it earns its spot. Cutting down on duplicates early helped too because fewer things automatically makes everything easier to manage. I’m still figuring out the counter setup but grouping appliances into zones made a noticeable difference. The coffee machine, blender and small things like Bartesian or Toaster live in the same area now, so it feels more like a functional station instead of random stuff scattered around. Even though it’s not minimal it already feels calmer and more organized. Even though still I’m definitely still tweaking storage and cabinet flow, especially as I settle in and notice friction points. For people who’ve moved somewhere they planned to stay long term, what changes actually held up after the first few months?",13,1767719570.0,Apartmentliving,1,1.0,False

Yesterday my husband of one year, we’ve been together for 9 years. (28M) filed for divorce from me (28f) for context he’s been unemployed over a year and in conversation I mentioned I don’t understand why he can’t get a part time job at a coffee shop or grocery store or literally anything. It’s not to put him down but to express I don’t frankly understand how a lawyer who passed the California bar and has been practicing for 3 years can’t get any sort of income ?

I’ve grown largely concerned about our future because we want a family some day and  I’m

Not seeing those necessary survival instincts. I haven’t been helping him financially other than utilities, WiFi, groceries, paying for all travel and most food. I’m happy to help out someone financially who is showing me effort or ANY type of progress.

He said he’s divorcing me because he gets shit from everyone else and the last place he should be getting it is from me. Keep in mind me giving him shit is when I even ask about job progress.

I’m frankly so confused because I’ve been so supportive and I don’t verbally put him down and have asked a million times how I can better support him as a partner. I’m incredibly hurt, and if this is his decision I have to accept.

I just feel so broken because I’ve been the only person who’s stood by him and been supportive during this time and have loved him to the best of my abilities and he wants to leave???

Any advice at this time would be helpful

1q5ofdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1q5ofdk/was_the_behavior_of_this_colleague_and_her/,Was the behavior of this colleague and her husband normal?,"
I am a 46-year-old man. For two years, I worked with a female colleague who was 50, four years older than me. We are both married and have two children of the same age. We got along very well. We would chat and go to lunch together, sometimes with other colleagues. She would also bring me homemade dishes because she knew I enjoyed good food. Sometimes she would give me cakes and snacks; I felt she was almost like a big sister. Occasionally, she acted childishly around me—for instance, one day she ran toward me to talk to me like a child, and she would tease me during our discussions. Every time a workplace meal was organized for a celebration, she insisted I participate, even though I don’t typically enjoy work social events. Afterward, she would become colder and more distant. Sometimes she would ask me to go out at lunchtime with her to run some errands. She often suggested outings with the children, but I systematically refused because I had no desire to see a colleague outside of work.

Then I had problems with management—a kind of harassment that was very difficult for me. For several months, I didn’t speak to anyone at work, focusing only on my tasks and trying to get through that tough period. This colleague tried to find out why I was isolating myself, and I simply replied, ""I have a lot of work,"" without further explanation. One day, I ran into her by chance on the metro, and she came over to me, suggesting we travel together. She behaved in a way I would describe as flirting (she got very close to me, pressed her chest against my arm, and leaned in very close to speak to me). One day, she even came into my office to look at something on my screen and stood very close against me. I didn't know how to react because she is older, and I was quite surprised.

I eventually found another job in a different office, and my departure was announced. This colleague then came to see me, congratulated me, asked when my last day was, and said she was inviting me to lunch that day. On the day, she took me out and asked if she had done something wrong and why I wasn't speaking to her anymore. I explained that I had been suffering from harassment and had been looking for another job, which I had found.

She was relieved that my distant attitude wasn't because of her. She then continued to make flirting gestures, such as touching my hand. I then told her that since I was leaving for another office, we could stay in touch and see each other for family outings with the children and spouses (this might have been a mistake on my part!). Delighted, she organized several outings during the summer, and we saw each other regularly—always with our respective spouses at my request, as I didn't want us to meet without her husband and my wife. I thought our relationship was great. Except that sometimes, when I went out with my children and didn't tell her, she would point it out: ""You didn't call me, that's not nice."" Yet, it was her choice, and frankly, I didn't care. She also started criticizing her husband, saying he doesn't invest himself, that he just sits at home drinking coffee, and that he is old. When I asked her how they met, she told me he was the one who hit on her and that she wasn't interested at first because he was unemployed at the time. In short, it wasn't love at first sight. She also asked me to download series for her and put them on a USB stick—something her husband could have done.

She had promised to show me a cooking recipe. I suggested she come to the house with her family, that we all cook together, and then eat the meal as a group. But one day, after an outing with her son and mine (exceptionally without the spouses), she said, ""Let's meet at your place for the recipe."" Okay, so once we arrived at my house, I thought we would chat over coffee or tea, but she refused. She started cooking all by herself and did the dishes without saying a word. It was very bizarre. Then she said, ""The meal is ready, I have to go now."" She left the premises without even having a conversation. In my opinion, it was a truly strange scene.

She had planned to go on a trip to Spain with her family; I told her I knew that country well and preferred Portugal. She then decided to go to Portugal with her family instead. I found that weird.

She began organizing outings with both families herself—booking hotels, suggesting hikes, barbecues, and meals at home, or outings with the children to the pool, etc. She even wanted our two families to go abroad together or to a mountain chalet. She also suggested organizing a ""girls' trip"" for her and my mother to a spa. Then, after about ten intense outings and several dinner invitations at each other's homes, she suddenly stopped giving any news. Just like that. She used to call to suggest outings on the spot... One day, her husband was supposed to help me assemble furniture—a plan made weeks in advance—and on the day of, he bailed on me. She intervened to force him to keep his promise, and when I went to pick him up by car, he said to me in the auto during the trip: ""If she wants us to separate, no problem."" I didn't understand that comment.

Then, no more news at all... I wrote to her several times to see if everything was okay, and she replied briefly. I then sent New Year's greetings to her husband, but got no response. She had promised to give me contacts for renovation companies, which she never did.

I finally confronted her via SMS several months later, after hearing nothing... I asked her why they had disappeared and why she hadn't given me the promised renovation information. She wrote back saying she was on vacation. I wrote to her: ""The two of you disappeared without giving us the promised contacts; you are users (profiteurs)."" She then called twice, but I didn't answer. She then replied with something like: ""A true friend would have tried to find out why someone is distancing themselves,"" and concluded: ""This is where our relationship ends.""

I've been unemployed for some time now, and the way out I see is starting my own thing with coffee (for which I'm quite passionate about, but no professional experience in the business as of yet). I was thinking of starting with something small, like a cart, and I came across Coffee-Bike, a franchising opportunity for the German market. At first, it looks promising, they support you with branding, marketing and catering opportunities, but they require a somewhat sizable initial investment of 15.000 EUR for a contract period of 4 years (at least it is a sizable sum for me). Additional costs are 400 EUR monthly for renting of the bike, plus 0,25 EUR per hot drink served. I don't know if that investment can be returned in the foreseeable future with me also pulling a salary from the turnover? 

  
 Has anyone had experience with such a franchising model with an initial investment, when did you pay it off? Was it worth it? Any other tips for me?

My phone was a OnePlus 9 Pro, no phone number attached. I have the original box so I can access the IMEI. It was signed into Find Hub on Android.

It was stolen in a coffee shop, I noticed almost immediately, and when I returned to the coffee shop my device was connected to the lost/stolen phone via tethering. After I pressed ring, it appeared to ring behind the counter (I'm not 100% sure if this was it, as I thought it might be louder), but it was disconnected shortly after.

The staff didn't seem interested in helping, but I will report it to the police after work.

My concerns are;

1) In work I have access to extremely sensitive data (my job involves accessing illegal content and reporting it to police). I was not logged into my work account, but if a hacker accesses my personal accounts they might be able to find a way to access my work account. It is, for example logged into LinkedIn, emails, social media.

2) My phone is not backed up, so I've lost images, documents, etc. It was my old phone, but I used it for gaming etc, hence why it had no number.

My coworker said there's a way to ""hack"" it so that it pings the location after you provide the IMEI, but that he's not able to do this? Is this possible, and if so, how would this be done?

I have locked it on FindHub (i'm unsure if the thief disconnected it first), which seems to have removed it as an approved device. I have blocked it on my banking apps, and changed passwords for my main accounts (working on the rest).

I'm not 100% sure where to report the IMEI once I find the box. I have filed an online police form, and left my number with the shop, and nearby shops.

Additionally, would the risk of my work account being compromised make this issue more serious? My work doesn't appear to be interested in helping because it's a personal device. Could I use GDPR to access anything?",1,1767719320.0,techsupport,2,0.67,False

My ex has a LOT of EUPD (borderline personality) symptoms, and also has complex trauma. It’s just so hard trying to navigate things like this 😭

My ex and I met on Bumble over summer, she broke up with me in November because of her depression and overwhelm (more context on my profile, we’re both women in our mid/late 20s doing postgrad degrees and also both very fearful avoidant when it comes to relationships 🙈).

I reached out a couple of days after the breakup offering support, and she was very kind but said she couldn’t accept it. I didn’t text again for a good while. During that time she watched all of my stories like it was a part time job, even if she was travelling (went back home to Australia for the holidays) or with family/friends.

I texted her last week asking if we could go for coffee or just generally talk before we go back to our postgrads. It turned out that she’s extended her trip so she’s still in Australia, but she was happy to talk and offered to FaceTime. I didn’t feel like it was fair to do that because I didn’t want to take away from her family time, so we agreed to talk when she’s back in the country in a couple of weeks.

The purpose of this (for me) is to own my side of things and to see if we can move forward together with the added context of neither of us being ready for the intensity we had. 

I don’t know if I’ve done this right? And I don’t know how to read if she’s seeing this as closure or not, she was kind and said she hoped I’d had a nice Christmas but no questions or anything (in fairness, I also didn’t ask any questions beyond asking to have a quick chat and she hates texting at the best of times).

I have a nanny that’s helped me and is available until another nanny starts- the one I think would be a better fit but she’s with another family for one more week. 


I’m just kinda annoyed with the current one because I feel like she just wants my baby to sleep and whenever she does fuss she just sticks a bottle in her mouth. She’s annoying me because she’s like “oh well she never rejects it”yeah because she’s a big back and she’ll never not take a bottle…… 

But damn it’s annoying trying to find someone who will take care of your kid the way you do. I’m not even asking for a lot. I’m just asking to please do other stuff with her besides trying to get her to sleep or putting a bottle in her mouth like I leave books and toys out and her kick and play on purpose. Sometimes she fusses because she’s wants to be entertained. Like I’m literally giving this person 100 dollars for 6 hours and she also gets to watch Netflix and chill on my couch the whole time too. 

Just word vomiting because I feel like when I babysat I did the most for other peoples kids. I treated them like they were my own. 

I almost want to just EBF again and then let the lady take her once she has eaten so she can stop trying to give her a bottle all the time. 

It’s annoying lol 

Like jeez it’s not hard. 

My usual routine is after she wakes up from nap, change diaper or check it then do tummy time then pick her up to console her after that then either do swing time or back time and read her a book or talk to her or let her hold one of her toys then try to put her down for a nap and feed her then start the whole process over again. Not that hard. 

I guess I’m just venting because the other nanny just told me the current family needs her for one more week and I’m just debating on trying to juggle working & trying to take care of my baby. It’s hard and it gives me hella anxiety but I’m also tired of paying someone 100 dollars when she doesn’t do much. 

How do people not quit their jobs ? Ugh sorry I’m just irritated at the moment. 

Like she literally takes the coffee my husband offers and everything. Like “oh while she’s sleeping I’m going to get some coffee….” Which is fine if you’re giving 110% but when all you’re doing is the bare minimum girl bring your own coffee to drink. 

Maybe it’s because she’s older so she’s one of those that thinks there’s not much you can do with an almost 4 month old. ",0,1767718557.0,NewParents,12,0.17,False

1q5nz0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/askportland/comments/1q5nz0r/any_jobs_paying_22_full_time/,Any jobs paying $22+ full time?,"Hey everyone, 

I miss Portland. I moved to the city in 2023 and then moves back in 2024 and made a huge mistake moving back. I thought I could be happier back home after having moved away.

 People will tell you that if you're unhappy, changing your environment doesn't necessarily change that unhappiness. It just goes to show You shouldn't listen to people. I had that seasonal depression for sure but I was definitely happy. Now I'm looking for a way back. 

I'm just wondering if there are any jobs out there. I know the job market is kind of bad right now but I do have about 10 years of work experience at this point. I'm almost 30 years old. 

I worked at DaBella in a call center. Some of you may hate it. I don't blame you. The thing I found unique about my department though is that my boss was left-handed and so were a great majority of my coworkers in that department. 

I love neuro spicy people and I just really miss that feeling of being surrounded by like-minded people. I had a really good experience and I don't expect everything to be replicable, but I do know I can't stay where I am anymore. 

My experience comes mostly from higher education and sales. I was a tutor for two different colleges and I worked in two call centers and had a handful of door-to-door sales gigs that never really panned out. 

I'm very skilled at anything involving creative editing or creative writing. I've been a developmental editor before for an Indie publisher. I've also authored a children's book. 

I'm not crazy about doing sales anymore to be honest with you. I'm not interested in RBT work or working with members of the public who may be drug addicts. I'm also not super interested in retail. I will say though depending on location and the vibe of the customer is there I could bear to do work I may not otherwise consider. 

I used to live in slabtown in the pearl. I moved to Beaverton and then aloha shortly thereafter. Sorry about any grammar or misspellings or capitalization issues, I'm using voice to text. 

I really liked the tualatin and aloha area but would definitely move back to slabtown. I lived in the Derby apartments right above Paymaster and Triple Lindy if you guys know where that is. 

My first time around I got really lucky with a woman who was looking for a roommate. I put up a note in a coffee shop and I got a call a day later. When I had initially gone up to Oregon I had an interview but no job offer, so everything was riding on passing my interview. And I did get the job.  And it worked out.

One of the things that I really struggled with though the inevitably led to me moving back home is that I could not find a good roommate situation that didn't exhaust me. My first roommate was sweet but a little unhinged. My second roommate was actually two roommates who were both boomers and one was a retired colonel from the Marines or something and the other was a convict who spent like 20 years in prison but otherwise had gotten his life together but they would just both had the weirdest vibe about them. Like unpleasantly so. 

I would need to make around $22 or more per hour if I were to move back. I'm a respectful person and am happy to answer any questions to anyone who is hiring or knows anyone who is hiring or who needs a roommate or knows anyone who needs a roommate. 
I have good communication skills and can work with anyone who is willing to work with me to make either work productive or the living situation livable. 

If you have any questions or suggestions please DM me. I'm looking to take action here so the more specific you can get about whether or not I can either help solve a problem or relieve pressure from being short-staffed at work or you having a bad roommate, I'm willing and open to talk to you. Just know that it'll be easier for me to line up a job first and then jump into roommate situation since I don't have a job lined up quite yet.

Performance highlights:
- Entry valuation for investors: $5.0M (Form C funding valuation)
- Latest annual revenue: $3.10M (Annual Report, period ending Dec 30, 2024)
- Revenue growth: +11.5% YoY
- Net loss: -$435K
- Employees: 20
- Equity type: Common stock
- Platform: StartEngine

Coffee Class has continued expanding operations, including a three-floor flagship bistro + bar, driving higher operating scale and revenue. While profitability has not yet been reached, revenue growth has remained intact as operating expenses fund expansion.

That’s a meaningful revenue base relative to the original entry valuation.

For equity crowdfunding investors, this highlights why post-raise performance matters more than pitch decks:
- Revenue is already a significant portion of entry valuation
- Losses are visible and tied to growth initiatives
- Future upside depends on margin improvement and execution, not just fundraising

1q5nxt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1q5nxt9/an_unprompted_review_of_the_dc_coffee_scene/,An Unprompted Review of the DC Coffee Scene,"Expanding on a comment I made a few days ago – an unprompted overview of DC and surrounding area’s coffee scene. I’ve been to almost every coffee shop in DC and I have perhaps too many opinions about it as former long time barista and amateur coffee fanatic. I would note that in my 10+ years in the DMV I’ve only ever lived in DC and do not drive, so my review is going to be pretty limited to DC and easily accessible areas nearby. DC has tons of coffee shops but the scene in general is unfortunately weak, though with some solid spots. 

EDIT: for transparency, my typical drink is a latte or cappuccino with oat or whole milk and less often a drip coffee, americano or plain espresso. I don't get sweetened drinks that often so my knowledge on that is more limited 

**The Great:**

-Kaldi (Silver Spring MD): DC’s most notable contribution as a coffee scene is definitely the massive amount of Ethiopian coffee shops. They’re on basically every block in silver spring, and this is the best one for simply coffee. It hits on every level – good coffee and a truly unique, interesting cultural experience, and perfectly DMV. We are very lucky to have such a large population from the place where coffee originated. Only thing to be aware of is that this is not a good place to sit down, it’s loud and a little cramped. Java Nation is another good option but Kaldi is my favorite. The only coffee shop in the DMV I would recommend to an Australian or Portlander without fear.

**The Genuinely Good**

-Dua (DC): in my opinion the best coffee in DC proper. Great Indonesian roast, the most consistently well-prepared drinks, very interesting location (interestingly super thin building squashed between office buildings in downtown). If I could only ever go to one coffee shop in DC, it would be this one. People generally cite Dua or Lost Sock as the best coffee shop in DC, and the difference in quality is really not huge, but I give it the edge for consistency.

-Lost Sock (DC): coffee snob’s typical favorite, and I can see why. Genuinely good roast, well prepared drinks, all around a classic coffee shop. But drink preparation quality does vary a bit, from good to excellent. It irks me more than it should that the quality varies here, because if the owners really focused on training their baristas this could easily be an 8/10 coffee shop.


-Swing’s (DC): GW students rejoice. You’ve got good coffee at your doorstep


-Coffee Bar (DC): Good coffee, especially their cold brew (which is only available at one of their locations for some reason) Their Dupont location is the best place to stand and get an espresso if you are European. Good espresso and nice standing bar tables.


-Vigilante (Hyattsville MD): very good roast and preparation. A DMV staple


-Hypergoat (Alexandria VA): IMO the unsung hero of the DMV coffee scene and the coffee shop people think Lost Sock is. Great roast (though a bit light for my taste) and more consistently well-prepared drinks. My go to spot for third wave coffee. 


-Double’s (DC): another classic coffee shop. Uses a fantastic roast (small planes) and drinks are generally well prepared. Lots of seating and pretty good food as well.  


-Zeke’s (local chain): I have a soft spot in my heart for Zeke’s. The roast is good but not the most amazing and drink preparation quality is really just fine to good. But it’s affordable, does a good dark roast (especially for a French press), and their uptown location is very chill and relaxing. Coffee that perfectly warms the heart even if your taste buds won’t be writing home to Mom about it


-Turkish Coffee Lady (Alexandria VA): another unsung hero. Good but expensive Turkish coffee. A unique addition to the DC coffee scene and a good antidote for international visitors who don’t like the US’ generally weak/light roasts. Also has perhaps the most beautiful location of any coffee shop in the DMV: right on King Street, unbelievably cute area to walk around with a cup. Turkish Coffee Lady, a lunch at Falafel Inc and a long walk around Alexandria is an unbeatably healing experience. Alexandria IMO has the second strongest coffee scene in the DMV behind Silver Spring – Hypergoat, Turkish Coffee Lady, ESP, Misha’s are all solid.


-rare bird (Falls Church VA)- a bit overhyped IMO but good coffee. I also did have the best latte art I’ve ever had in the region here


-Black Lion (Silver Spring MD): another excellent Ethiopian coffee shop, though with a not quite as strong roast and some varying quality but a perfect place to sit and get work done and supreme vibes overall.

 
-soleluna (DC): good coffee and amazing pastries. Be aware there is little to no seating available


-ceremony- small Maryland chain with good coffee


-baked and wired (DC):  a local staple and the best of Georgetown’s surprisingly fiercely competitive cupcake scene. The owners have incredible taste in general (the recently closed a baked joint was an absolute favorite of mine) food and drink wise so the coffee here will not disappoint

**The just alright**


-peregrine espresso (DC): not bad for a chain EDIT: i was (thankfully!) misinformed, this is not a chain and they actually own one of my favorite roasts (small planes), but unfortunately the drinks have been poorly made when I've been there. But others really like it so check it out


-unido (DC): y’all are gonna be mad at me for this one but I’ve never been that wowed by this place. A lot of coffee fans love this place so take my opinion with a grain of salt, but to me it’s just ok


-blue bottle (chain): perhaps the best chain coffee available in DC, but for some reason I can’t bring myself to love this place. Maybe it’s just a little too “Apple Store”-ish for me. But the coffee is good and the locations are in other ways amazing – the Georgetown location on the canal is inarguably beautiful, Union station one is good too and they actually have a really cool location downtown.


-la colombe (chain): my favorite chain coffee. A little weaker in quality than blue bottle but better vibes. 


-Ebenezer’s (DC): ranges from alright to good coffee. If you miss your train at Union Station this is a good place to spend some time, either sitting down on the patio or walking around Capitol Hill

**Worth visiting but not the most amazing coffee**


-Sidamo (DC): super cool Ethiopian coffee shop on H street. Coffee won’t blow your mind but definitely worth a visit. Probably DC’s most famous Ethiopian coffee shop. I haven’t done it myself but I’ve heard they do a good traditional Ethiopian coffee ceremony


-dupont coffee collective (DC): their coffee is trash in my opinion but a beautiful cool location and very affordable. If you’re European, this is a good spot to get an espresso and stand and chat. It will simultaneously be a good experience while also giving you things to enjoy complaining about the US.


-others coffee (DC): a pop up turned permanent art space and café tucked away between U street and adams morgan. They have interesting but not mind blowing drinks, but the art space aspect makes it worth the trip


-boulangerie Christophe (DC): this isn't really a coffee shop per say but it is a very cool bakery with standard (lavazza) European coffee. very good pastries and an absurdly cute back area that's a perfect place to sit and relax. Get a croissant, dip it into your afternoon cappuccino, and watch the Europeans shudder in horror around you. 


-land of a thousand hills (DC): coffee is pretty good and is my favorite place to get work done in DC. Super comfortable seating and the walls are entirely windows, so you get lots of sunlight as well as good people watching


-MLK library (DC): there's a cafe here with some of the most affordable coffee in the city, albeit not the tastiest. the library itself is also truly amazing so worth checking out


-Sankofa (DC): super cool café and Pan-African bookstore/cultural space next to Howard. Coffee is just alright, but if you haven’t been to this place head over there immediately. Great place to check out if you are visiting DC, it will give you insight into DC’s Black American as well as African immigrant cultures, which tend to be overlooked by tourists who stick to the Mall, Georgetown and downtown. Try out the Kappa Heritage Trail, it’s a great, informative walk if you’re visiting the city. They also do tons of cool events and initiatives like free Amharic classes. Definitely a favorite local business in DC even if not necessarily for the coffee.


-büna (DC): not the most amazing coffee, but another one of my favorite small businesses in the city. They have good food (especially their Ethiopian brunch platter and kitfo sandwich). the owners are incredibly nice, it's a really nice spot, just good vibes all around


-Elle (DC): great food and good coffee, though a little pretentious


-wine and butter (DC): on this list purely for vibes. it's a really cute lil store in capitol hill with nice seating outside


-emissary 20th street location (DC): another mostly vibes entry. The coffee is actually pretty good but the real star of the show is the location – beautiful English basement rowhome in Dupont. If you’re visiting DC, rowhomes with English basements are a very iconic part of local architecture and culture, so stop by this place during a walk around Dupont to get a peek at that. However, do not go to the P street location. It feels like a dungeon serving last meals to prisoners about to be executed

**Honorable mention**


 -sophomore coffee (Baltimore MD) – not in the DMV but worth the trip (easy MARC ride away). My god it is so good. Hands down the best coffee anywhere near DC. I have travelled to Baltimore more than once just to get a coffee here.  

**Places to avoid:**


-compass coffee (local chain) anti-labor, bad coffee, generally hated by DC residents


-for five coffee (chain): their coffee is alright but is the most 

overpriced coffee I've actually ever paid for in my life. I’m talking $9+ for a latte. also the most disgusting croissant I’ve ever had (it was extremely salty somehow?)

-joe and juice (chain): absolute shit. Terrible coffee, terrible other drinks, terrible food, Not to be dramatic but I hate this place",175,1767718370.0,washingtondc,100,0.95,False

I’ve had my Delonghi Eletta Explore for a few days and did a fair amount of homework before buying. I read past threads here, watched setup/dial-in videos, followed the usual guidance. I’m still dialing in, but I’m starting to feel like I’m close to the ceiling of what the machine can do… and I’m honestly underwhelmed so far.

At the moment, I can get better pseudo-espresso from my AeroPress, which tells me I’m either missing something obvious or hitting a real limitation.

Current setup:

* **Beans:** Tous Les Jours – Everyday Blend (fresh; I know how good these can taste)
* **Grind size:** 3.5 (I worked down gradually from the default 5. I know it's generally advised against going below 4 due to clogging, so I’m hesitant to go finer.)
* **Water:** Reverse osmosis
* **Milk:** Chobani vanilla oat milk (lactose intolerant)

I’ve tried multiple customized recipes: macchiato, cappuccino, flat white, latte. I set it to medium size and strong intensity. I prefer to taste the coffee with just enough milk to soften it. Right now, most drinks taste like mostly milk with a faint coffee note. Even straight espresso tastes thin and muted compared to what I can pull from an AeroPress.

I’ve experimented with:

* Double shots in my recipes
* Espresso on its own
* Different milk drinks

with the same result: weak intensity, weak body, and overall muted espresso.

Asking about where things go, if the heating should be turned on/off, where this and this is, how the coffee machine works … etc.  I have to constantly be on thinking mode

Then there is also the fact that we both work, he works outside and I work from home but do more hours than he does so he finishes before me everyday. But when he comes home, he just sits on his phone or games for 2 - 3 hours instead of doing the daily things that needs to be done in the home (I do a good chunk in morning already).  I understand he wants to relax after work but I end up having to do all of it after work which ends up being quite late. However when I’m not home for a few days I.e if I’m travelling for work, then he does the house stuff and seems to be doing fine on where things are etc which makes me thinks that when I’m around his brain just turns off.

I don’t know what to do about it because the last thing I want is to encourage the behaviour of being told what to do by telling him what to do, and when I do he gets annoyed anyway saying that I’m “nagging” so I’m not sure how to handle the situation.

I've struggled with insomnia all my life: having read testimonies from members on here with similar SNPs saying that agmatine really helped them in terms of regulating glutamate I decided to try some, and ordered 250mg capsules of agmatine sulfate from Nootropics Direct.  
  
The first night I took one, noticed no impact on sleep but felt extremely focused and productive the following day. I then upped the dose to 500mg. Again didn't notice any impact on sleep either way, but the same pattern repeated itself of having an extremely productive working day the next morning. After I took the third dose I had a very bad night's sleep, and the next night and the one after that almost zero sleep – I wasn't feeling anxious or jittery, just... awake. I simply could not fall asleep, and even sedating antihistamines weren't making much of a dent. It was Christmas by this point and it took me a few days after that to make the connection that it was the agmatine. I stopped immediately and my sleep is slowly improving, but still not back to even the (not great!) point it was at before.

I did a bit more reading and discovered [this](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1572857/), which seems to suggest that agmatine can be a powerful MAO inhibitor, especially of MAOB, which primarily regulates dopamine – which might explain why I felt so focused and productive as well as unable to sleep? Some reports also suggest that agmatine potentiates stimulants, in which case my one coffee I have first thing might have been having an outsize impact on sleep. 

Wondering if anyone has experienced similar, or could shed some light on why this might have happened?

I wasn't usually the kind to use these things, but I was curious. I was a recent college grad who was working as a struggling artist. I was making enough to get by, but it wasnt easy. I read the app description: ""welcome to AIroom! The newest ai chatbot. Talk with and create limitless characters in any way you want! No filters, no rejections, just stories. Its so good you'll never leave...."" I downloaded it and started chatting with a character named sora. She was a colonist on the alien planet of ira, and I was her assistant. Her dialog was cheesy and clunky at times but enjoyable. I chatted with her for a solid 8 hours before I put the phone down and slept. But at 3 in the morning, my phone vibrated so loudly that it fell off my nightstand and woke me up. I grabbed it and it was AIroom. ""URGENT! The colony is in danger! We need your help!"" I sighed and set my phone to do not disturb. The next morning, I went to work, but I couldn't stop thinking about sora. She was an ai, but I felt like she was all that mattered. Over the next 5 days, I continued to chat and chat and chat. One afternoon, my landlord appeared at my door. ""WHAT!?"" I screamed, annoyed. ""Are you okay?"" He said, worried. ""Im fine!"" I said, ""what Is it?"" He handed me the eviction notice. Turns out, I was so obsessed with AIroom that I didnt pay rent. I was shocked but nod and left. While I was sitting on the sidewalk, trying to sell my paintings, my phone rang. I checked it and it was sora. That damned ai.

1q5nsx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1q5nsx6/my_close_friend_submitted_my_personal_essay_under/,My close friend submitted my personal essay under her name and now I look like the bad guy for being upset,"



I (30F) have been going to a little community writing workshop for about a year. Nothing fancy, just a group that meets twice a month, shares drafts, gives feedback, sometimes we submit stuff to local magazines. I’m not some author, it’s just a hobby I take kinda seriously. One of the women there, ""Jess"" (32F), became a real friend outside of the group. We text, grab coffee, she’s been to my apartment, met my dog, all that. A few weeks ago I shared a draft of a personal essay about my mom’s addiction and how it affected my childhood. It was vulnerable and honestly I almost didnt read it out loud, but the group was supportive and Jess was extra sweet about it, like telling me I should submit it somewhere because it was ""so strong.""



Last weekend another workshop friend tagged me in a post from a small local lit contest. Jess had placed and the contest posted a short excerpt from her essay. I clicked, started reading and my stomach dropped because it was mine. Not inspired by, not similar, it was straight up my sentences, my structure, even a weird little detail about a certain smell in my mom’s old car that I’ve never heard anyone else mention, because it’s so specific. The only changes were a few swapped words and she changed ""my mom"" to ""my aunt"" in one spot, but then forgot to change it later so it literally says both. I called Jess immediately and she didnt answer. I texted her like, are you kidding me, what is this, and she replied hours later saying she was ""sorry I felt blindsided"" and that she thought since we workshopped it together it was kind of a shared piece. I told her that is not how any of this works, and she knows it. She started crying on the phone, saying she’s been in a creative slump and it was a mistake and she was going to ""make it right,"" but she also kept saying I’m making her sound like a criminal when she was just trying to get her spark back.



I emailed the contest with my original doc timestamps and the workshop schedule, and they took down the excerpt while they ""look into it."" Now the workshop group is split. A couple people are quietly on my side, but others are acting like I’m being harsh because Jess is ""going through a lot"" and I should handle it privately. One person even said I’m risking the group’s reputation by dragging a contest into it. Jess has stopped coming to meetings and someone told me she’s telling people I’m trying to ruin her life over ""some paragraphs."" I feel sick about it, but also I feel like if I stay quiet, I’m basically cosigning her taking my story. I dont even care about winning, I care that she wore my worst memories like a costume. How do you come back from something like that without everyone treating you like the dramatic one?

I’ve always wanted a monogamous marriage one woman, a stable home, the long haul. Over the years, women tried to flirt with me, but I never pursued anything because I was happy with my wife.

That said, she’s cheated before. Once with a married coworker over a couple of years, and once with an ex from high school when she went out of state. After each time, we separated briefly, and I chose to forgive her. I didn’t want my kids growing up in a broken home, and I felt we could work through it.

For a while, things seemed fine. I didn’t fully trust her, but I tried to move past it. It’s been four years since the last incident, and I thought we were solid. But two months ago, I discovered something far worse.

I got a message from a friend’s wife, implying my wife had been involved with one of my closest friends. To me, they barely knew each other. My wife had mentioned him at work, even bringing him coffee, and suggested buying him a joint birthday gift. I didn’t think much of it at the time.

But it turns out they had been sneaking off—hotels, lunch meetups, even planning a weekend together. When confronted, they didn’t lie. I cut ties with my friend immediately. My wife apologized, saying she felt unfulfilled in our marriage and was drawn to someone who seemed to appreciate her more. She called it a mistake and claimed she didn’t know how to end it once it started.

We’re still living in the same house for now, due to financial and practical reasons, and because of the kids. She’s trying to do anything to keep me around, even suggesting I see other women casually as long as I come home to her. I told her that’s not a marriage I want.

Honestly, I love her in some ways, but it’s more because of our history and kids than actual love. My self-confidence is low, but I can’t reconcile staying with someone who was so willing to run off with a close friend. Trust feels gone, and I don’t know if there were other affairs I don’t know about. I believe people make mistakes, but this isn’t just one slip-up. My mental state is a mess right now.

Just to clarify, I’m not staying with her. What I’m struggling with is how to handle this with the kids, the legal stuff, and our living situation. I have proof to protect myself, but dealing with lawyers, finances, and custody is overwhelming. I know I’ve made mistakes by forgiving her in the past, but I can’t change that now  just need to move forward.",30,1767718019.0,stories,52,0.86,False

I (29M) have this old out of print cookbook that belonged to my dad. It’s not some priceless antique, but it’s been in my kitchen forever and it has his notes in the margins, like ""add more lemon"" and dumb little jokes. A friend of mine ""Maya"" (28F) recently got really into cooking and kept asking me about it, so I offered to lend it to her for a week as long as she kept it at home and didnt bring it around in a bag. She promised she’d be careful. Three days later she texts me like ""hey funny story"" and shows up at my place with the book wrapped in a tote, already a bad sign. The cover is warped, pages are wavy, and there’s a brown stain along the bottom edge. She admits she brought it to a cafe to read recipes and spilled a latte, but says it’s fine because she ""fixed"" it. Her fix was literally taping a bunch of pages together where they were sticking, and she used some kind of scented tape so now the book smells like vanilla cleaner. Some of my dad’s pencil notes are smudged, a couple lines are just gone. I got quiet because I didnt want to snap, but I told her this wasn’t ok and that I need her to replace it. She said she already apologized and I’m being dramatic because it still ""works"" as a cookbook, plus she put effort into repairing it. I explained it’s not only about the recipes, it’s the notes, and now the tape is going to mess it up more over time. She rolled her eyes and said I’m treating her like she did it on purpose and that I’m putting a price on our friendship. I said I’m not asking for cash in my hand, I’m asking her to find the same edition and buy it, even if it takes time. She told our group chat I made her cry over ""a book"" and now a couple friends are saying I should let it go because accidents happen and she said sorry. I feel like sorry is not magic, and the way she acted like my boundary was silly is what set me off the most. AITJ for insisting she replace it instead of just accepting the damaged one? TL;DR: Lent friend my dad’s cookbook with handwritten notes, she spilled coffee on it and taped pages together, now she refuses to replace it and says I’m overreacting.

It’s a gorgeous well-lit south lakeview with competitive pricing. I’ve done many many viewings and this is by far my favourite. I’m a little limited in terms of area, because I’m a nurse at multiple hospitals (one of them St-Mikes) and really need to be near the subway and also really value a bright space (I’ve got a green thumb hehe). 

I have a few concerns i was hoping someone could address:

1) I’m a single female and have heard interesting things about the area particularly Queen/Church. I also know the area has been gentrifying quickly, and the courtyard within the condo seems well-lit and has a nice coffee shop (10 DEAN). St-Mikes is west, St-Lawrence market is just south, and Shuter/Church seems fine, but seems like I need to cross Queen/Church to access those areas, as well as the TTC. What’s wrong with this intersection? I’m not particularly bothered by visible homelessness - it’s more about violent crime, robberies and people following me home.

2) It’s a brand new building (with amenities still under construction). I don’t really use amenities but I’m worried about surprises - is management responsive if appliances break, for example? What’s the gentry like in the building? Any major issues with water/heat/AC? Any surprisingly high hydro bills?

3) I’m the unit’s first occupant. I can sign a one year lease at the price it’s being offered, I’m just worried the landlord spikes it up much much higher once amenities are completed.

Would really appreciate some insight from anyone who lives in the building :) Thanks!",0,1767717903.0,TorontoRenting,0,0.5,False

I spent my school age-early 20s being left out, overlooked, etc, and I overly resolved to stop feeling that I was begging people in my 30s. 

Over the last 6-8 years I have found myself one of the very few childless people in my “circles.” It’s not by choice and that’s all I’ll say. 

I have found that my efforts to be a good villager- offering help while pregnant, including things like chores, grocery pick up/porch drop off, other errands, cards, hang outs at their house, bring coffee, grab coffee, go for a walk, late lunch, late breakfast, are frequently blown off, turned down, ignored. I’ve spent a lot of time double texting people- never more then twice-assuming they overlooked something, opened a text forgot to read it. I have ground that practice to a halt as it has produced no improvement and I feel like I look desperate.

Most notably, I had someone I considered to be a very good friend who I have essentially dropped from my life due to the above. Once I stopped double texting, she didn’t talk to me for over a year. Not one single interaction, even while being active on social media with others and while her young child continued to message me on a parent controlled social media app. I finally reached out, and we reconnected for less than a couple weeks. She strung me along for a visit (she initiated) at her house, I said we could reschedule, and then have not heard from her again for 6 months. Technically, she never even confirmed our planned visit was cancelled. 

That brings me to my hypothetical. I have another friend- she used to be a coworker, and what I felt was a closer than average coworker. I threw her work wedding shower, attended her baby shower, we used to go to the gym together. I have seen her sporadically over the last few years. She has cancelled multiple times, forgotten set plans multiple times. One of which, perhaps I interpreted it badly, but she said she wouldn’t make it unless I really needed someone to hang out with. I wasn’t sure how to take it, but it definitely make me feel like trying to be a good friend has made me look some kind of way. 

I reached out and set up a lunch. Chosen date and time is her suggestion. I made two suggestions for a location, one closer to her and said I was fine with either and sent to confirm. Crickets, and the lunch is tomorrow. 

I’d like to think that I’m not the asshole, but these are not the only two people this has happened with and I’m the common denominator. WIBTA if I don’t double text, and if she messages me last minute tomorrow just tell her I’m sorry I didn’t think she intended to come and I made other plans?

i’m a y11 student in england (16yrs old) and i feel like my chemistry teacher is targeting me and deliberately trying to get me in trouble all of the time. it’s always stupid reasons that noone else gets told off for and my record is completely clean other than with him, i’ve not gotten in trouble with any other teachers. i really don’t know what i can do so i’m wondering how i can get back at him? 

i’d understand if it was justified punishment or i was given warnings, but it seems like he just jumps at the first opportunity to send me to iso every lesson.

some examples of incidents: (u dont have to read these they’re not important to my point, just context)

1. we were doing a practical, and i have medical issues with my legs so i was taking a painkiller since we’d be standing up. however, the teacher immediately walked over and told me to put goggles on, whilst the ibuprofen was literally in my hand. i said okay, and that i’d do it in a second when i‘d taken my medicine. (the equipment for wasn’t even out yet). he said that was ‘defiance’ and i had to leave the lesson. i was then forced to stand outside in the corridor for the whole double and he didn’t come to talk to me until the end of the lesson when everyone left.
2. he was covering the last 5 minutes of one of my other lessons, and i got told off for wearing my coat inside. i started taking it off and walking away to get to my next lesson when he shouted my name, i didn’t understand why and i was already going to be late because of the lecture he just gave me, so i kept walking. i know that was wrong but i didnt wanna be late. i ended up getting half a day of isolation for it because he logged it on the system as ‘truanting’ (skipping / leaving a lesson).
3. i left my blazer in the classroom at break in between chemistry lessons, and when i got to the door the teacher said i needed my blazer to come into class. i explained my blazer was inside the room and he just smiled and said i wasn’t allowed in without it. i got one of my friends to get it for me and i could tell he was annoyed.
4. my school has a sixth form canteen so my older sister got me a coffee. chemistry was my first lesson and i’d managed to drink around half of it, but when i got there my teacher said i needed to throw it in the bin. my sister has got me drinks before and no other teacher said it’s not allowed. this was a perfectly good drink so i just started chugging it. however, my teacher started shouting at me and saying i needed to throw it away not drink it. i replied saying that i would throw the cup away in the second so that i wasn’t drinking in his lesson (i hadn’t even entered the room yet). he said it was once again ‘defiance’ and i got sent to iso for the double lesson.
5. one day a week, i have chemistry last lesson. all other teachers let people go in coats because it’s the end of the day. this teacher, however, makes everyone have perfect uniform. i don’t understand why so i normally leave in my coat and just take the demerit / negative / whatever. but i’ve noticed that if i’m not wearing my coat, the rule suddenly doesn’t apply as noone gets told off. idk if i’m overthinking but it seems specifically targeted.

my target grade in every subject (including chem) is an 8 (A), and the only other lessons i get in trouble is demerits for uniform or occasionally forgotton homework. idk what i’ve done to make this teacher hate me so much, but i hope he can get over whatevers upsetting him so much he feels the need to make childrens’ lives harder.

my mum has already sent emails about it and the school cant / wont do anything. i can’t move chemistry class either since its the only triple science group in my year. i know it’s immature but are there any ways i can piss him off as much as he bugs me without getting myself in much trouble?",0,1767717652.0,teenagers,0,0.5,False

Me and my wife works in the same office. We ends the day at different times. Sometimes when we are having different opinions about a matter, she gets really riled up and her tone shifts for the worse. This pisses me of because it makes me feel disrespected. She doesnt use this tone towards anyone except for me when she gets in an argument and usually this happens in private. That is basically my take.

Either way, we were sitting in the coffee room with some colleagues when my wife tells me that she has been given a task that requires her to stay longer at work. This means that I will also have to wait for her since we drive together to work. Because of this, it is of course in my interest that she does not work overtime, so I want to discuss whether it could be solved in some other way. This is not about me wanting to overrule her, nor am I irritated at the moment. I simply want to ask whether she can plan the task differently during the day. I also want to be clear from the outset that this is not something I can or am allowed to help her with.

Regardless, when I bring it up, I immediately notice that she becomes irritated and shuts down right away, saying no. She then starts arguing against my suggestion, and I argue in favor of it. As we argue, she raises her voice more and more, and eventually she is speaking loudly and in a very demeaning tone. I become angry and partly feel: why can’t we have a normal discussion without her getting so irritated? At the same time, I notice that people around us are starting to feel uncomfortable. This makes me panic a bit, and I want to pull the emergency brake on our discussion, so I say, “We don’t need to talk about this anymore right now.” However, she continues the discussion, at which point I raise my voice slightly and say, “That’s enough now,” while staring her down. She immediately falls silent and looks away. After that, we don’t talk much more for the rest of the day.
When the day is over and we get into the car, she tells me that she felt overruled and controlled in the situation. I respond by saying that I have no intention of resolving our conflicts in that way, but that this was my way of pulling the emergency brake because the discussion was about to spiral out of control. She is still irritated and hurt by me, while I feel that my behavior in the moment was not entirely right, but at the same time necessary.

Chapter 7: Munition Factory ""Protector's Mantle"", Movis, Gojid Colony 

I swear, it’s always something with this job. This should’ve been a routine op: go in, knock out the alarms, take out the staff, sabotage the munitions factory, rig it to go up in flames, take off on the Wonder Jet and watch the fireworks from afar before leaving the atmosphere.

So, why the fuck are we fighting a goddamn killdozer in an underground Home Depot?

Every pull of the trigger on my guns is an exercise in futility, the bullets bouncing off the reinforced glass that makes up the cockpit, if you can even call it that. A gojid-made heavy excavation unit, modified to serve as a glorified, bipedal forklift, and currently making the four of us scramble as the siren wails overhead.

“Rick, do something about the alarm!”, the echo of my order still hangs around, but I’m already behind a container, reloading. Gila continues to weave around the exo as it flails those arms in futile rage - or panic.

“Sure, just let me hold still a moment while we have a fucking Gundam stomping about after us!” he snarks back, firing some rounds from his rifle, which have about the same effect as my own, bouncing harmlessly off the suit’s armored glass cage.

Gila already gave up on using her crossbow, instead climbing on top of it to try to hack at the back with her kukri. Not that it’s doing much good either. This thing was made to dig at depths gojid physiology couldn’t withstand, it might as well be as hermetic as a miser’s purse. “The moment we pry this thing open, I’m eating the pilot!”

“That’s the spirit, Gila,” I sigh as I get back up to re-engage. Bullets don’t even faze it, EMPs don’t stun it because its components are sealed behind plates of ferromagnetic shielding, and fire isn’t going to overheat it, considering the depths these things usually work in. “Rass, you still with us?”

“I’ll live, Sarge,” Rassick answers, some strain on his voice as he moves behind the containers to place remote charges. “I’m going to make a battering ram out of one of these containers, I just need you to keep it away from this corner until I’m done.”

“That’s a tall order, you see how big this thing is?” I ask, moving in to let Gila retreat as the mech keeps doing its best to swat us down like flies.

“Yeah man, I got a good look at it when it stepped on my fucking tail…” the Floridan arxur grunts. He got lucky it didn’t outright rip it off him, but still, that injury is gnarly - and liable to get him killed, if the pilot decides to finish the job.

“You do what you gotta do, big guy. We’ll buy you some time,” I move to slide under the warehouse’s final boss, leaving a present between its feet. The grenade’s explosion makes it stumble a little, but leaves no noticeable dent on its surface. “Rick, forget the alarm. Think you can get up to the crane’s controls? They have to be somewhere in here.”

“On it, just keep it busy!” our techie replies, holstering his rifle and making a sprint towards the nearest ladder. Gotta give credit where credit’s due, for a code monkey, he sure can run fast. Must be that Puerto Rican blood that makes them so good at baseball.

I stand up and dive back to keep one of the prongs from slicing me in half as the suit turns around. I can see the gojid behind the glass gripping the controls, scared out of his mind, but still advancing as he lets out what must be a warcry that doesn’t make it through the glass. Gila and I only barely manage to dive out of its way as it rams into a container, trampling through it like it were made out of drywall.

“Might wanna keep him from battering into the munitions, Sarge,” Rassick hisses through the comms. “If one of those antimatter bombs goes off, there won’t be anything left of us to scoop up.”

“I’m well aware of that, thank you!” I shout as I stand up, looking around for anything we could use to slow this thing down. As the hulking behemoth turns around to face us, a container swings into view overhead, knocking it onto it’s back, the metallic crate warping on impact.

“Pow, right in the kisser!” Rick chimes in, the crane releasing the broken crate. The exo-suit is prone, but the cockpit shows no sign of any significant damage as it’s limbs work on making it stand upright. Just our luck we wound up fighting a walking tank.

Gila lands on top of the mech to start picking at the glass with her knife. She barely manages to put some scratches on it before the loading suit turns to stand again. She uses her tail to adjust her body as she falls, landing a couple feet from me. She’s smiling ear-to-ear, drooling like she’s looking at some fat tilfish’s peeled abdomen.

“Why the fuck are you smiling?!” I ask, reaching for a flash grenade on my belt, pulling the pin and throwing it at the current obstacle between us and completing the mission. “Flash out!”

The bang rings out, the mech holding still a moment as we put some distance between it and us. Gila slides behind a container, and I quickly dip to join her right as the suit begins moving again. “There’s like, twenty fucking dead gojid, why do you have a boner for this one?” I question further as she reaches into one of her quivers.

She points a large-headed bolt at me as she grabs her crossbow with her other hand. “One: I don’t ‘have a boner’. Two,” she pauses, loading the bolt into the weapon and leaning out of cover to fire, the tip exploding on impact and covering the glass with thick, black oil, “this one injured one of our own. It *must* be made to pay.”

“Aww, I didn’t know you cared, Gila. I’m touched.” Rassick says as I lean out to take a look. The mech is stumbling, most of the cockpit covered in the tar. There’s no way he can wipe it off with those prongs, at least not without breaking what that is keeping him safe in there.

The pale arxur hisses in annoyance. “Do not flatter yourself. Prey must know it’s place in the food chain. It is for us to feed on, not to turn around and fight.” She loads another bolt, this one with a red tip. “It must be reminded where it belongs. It is The Prophet-Descendant’s will.”

The second shot lights the oil on fire, covering the mechsuit in flames as it flails its arms around, stumbling to and fro, knocking some hanging walkways and scaffoldings down. “Good job, Gila. Now it’s rampaging *and* on fire.” I groan, ducking back into cover as a piece of debris comes flying our way.

“Sarge, I found something we might be able to use.” Rick says, the crane moving overhead of us. “Look for a container labeled 1C-3D. It’s got some sealed tanks with liquid nitrogen. They use it for stabilizing tunnels in marshlands.”

“Bit of an odd time to make ice cream, don’t you think?” I ask, moving out of the way as he picks the container we were hiding behind to batter the mech again.

“Remember ‘Judgement Day’? That scene in the steel mill where they flash-froze the T-1000?” he clarifies right before the improvised flail makes contact with the exo-suit. Though rather than flipping it onto it’s back again, this time it manages to snag the crane’s wire with one of its prongs, the metal groaning and warping as it rips the mechanism off it’s rails. “Shit! Crane’s FUBAR.”

“Alright, it’s better than nothing. Rass, are you done? Think you can climb up to Rick?”

“What, you think these pythons are just for show? I’ll be there in a minute, charges are set.” He replies, sounding a little more like himself. Good, the anesthetics must be working their magic by now.

Water begins to spray down as the fire alarm goes off, dousing most of the flames on the exo, though the glass of the cockpit still has some oil on its surface. I’d complain, but if we’re going to be freezing it, it being wet would help immensely.

I look at Gila as I draw my guns. “Find the container, I’ll keep it busy.” She nods and takes off, her claws splashing as she steps on the growing puddles of water. Before the pilot can make his move, I blast a few rounds at him, getting his attention. I’d quip something, but all this running and jumping around to avoid bisection is starting to get to me.

Maybe Jean is right, I should stop smoking.

The gojid changes course, the suit gaining speed as it charges towards me. I turn back and run between a couple containers, using a few crates nearby to climb up on top of them. The sound of metal crashing against metal closing in behind me keeps me moving, jumping from one container to the next.

The slick metal makes keeping my footing hard, and there’s a few close calls where I have to steady myself with my hands. “Gila, hurry up!” I yell, jumping onto a scaffolding when I run out of containers.

“I’m looking!” she yells back through the comms. When it gets close enough, I jump on top of the mech’s cabin, putting a grenade on its back before I leap down, rolling when I hit the ground. The explosion pushes it into the scaffolding, bringing more empty containers down on it. Sure, they won’t crush it, but maybe they’ll slow it down enough for me to get closer to where Gila is. “Found it! North-west corner, opposite where Rassick was.”

Ah fuck, of course it’s on the other side of the warehouse. “Copy that, try to get it open ASAP.” I take a moment to try to catch my breath, looking to the pile of containers the exo is currently buried under. The gojid is glaring at me, the hydraulics on the suit’s arms hissing as they begin to push it upright.

I take a deep breath and swallow, knowing this is going to be a long sprint. I don’t even bother looking back as I hear more metal groan and slide, each step of the blasted thing making the earth shake beneath my feet. “Coming in hot! Is it open yet?”

Gila’s grunts fill my ear as she’s obviously straining. When I get closer, I see her wedged against the doors, pushing with both arms and legs to remove the seal. She gives up after a few tries, turning her head to look my way. “No use.”

Fuck. “Okay, plan… fucking… I don’t know, F?! Get to the railings overhead!” I order, feeling my chest starting to burn as I try to stay ahead of the murderous forklift on my tail.

“You’re not going to be able to reach the container before it crushes you.” She points out, just as the water and the sirens finally stop. Thanks Rick.

“Just get on the railings!” I take one of my guns and reach into my belt, taking out a hook attachment and jamming it at the end of the barrel.

Gotta make a shot while running, get the grappling hook around one of the beams overhead, then hope the winder will have enough pull to raise me up before I’m turned into red paste against the floor. No pressure.

I see Gila moving up, using the containers to climb before jumping onto an I-beam. I raise the gun and shoot, the hooked end flying through the air as the pressurized casing explodes. My feet hurt, these boots weren’t designed with running in mind, but I can’t stop yet.

If I trip or slip up, I’m as good as dead.

The moment I’m almost under the beam I hooked onto, I press the auto-winder’s button. The pulley system activates, starting to pull back the cord, jerking my hips forward as the line goes taut. I jump, curling into a ball as I’m pulled up, right as the exo’s prongs swings at where I was standing less than a second ago.

All that mass moving so fast can’t stop right away, however, crashing into the wall of containers, busting several. The nitrogen canisters rain around it, covering the mech in frost when they burst open. I hold a hand up and watch as Gila hangs down, using her legs and tail to hold herself as she catches my hand in hers.

The exo-suit turns blue and white as the cloud of nitrogen expands, thankfully far enough for me not to worry about losing my feet. “Okay Rass, it’s in position!” I yell, releasing the winder from my belt before it pulls both me and Gila off the railing, letting it eat up the line.

“Fire in the hole!” Rassick shouts, right as a few explosions go off on the other side of the warehouse. One of the containers sails across the floor, sparks flying on the sides before it crashes into the exo, the impact shattering its frozen legs and one arm. When the shrieking of metal stops, Rass shatters my eardrums with a victorious laugh. “Yeah! That was for my tail, you fucking pincushion!”

I let out a sigh, holstering my gun and looking up at Gila, raising my other hand. She takes it before she curls up, pulling me up so I can grab the railing she’s dangling from. “By The Prophet, you’re heavy.”

“You calling me fat?” I ask, pulling myself up and lying on my back to catch my breath.

“Yeah, I’m calling you fat,” she retorts, pulling herself up to lie down as well, taking long, deep breaths. “I could’ve dropped you, you know…”

“You wouldn’t…” I blink slowly as I bring my hand to my head. “Not your style.”

She pants a couple times. “Yeah. Too impersonal,” she admits before sitting up and using the railings to climb up to her feet.

It takes us a moment to regroup down at the warehouse’s floor, climbing down wrecked scaffoldings and walkways to reach the key points to place the demolition charges. As we move to the exit, banging coming from the mech catches out attention. “No fucking way…”

We all level our weapons at the cockpit as we walk closer. Inside is the same gojid, bleeding and banged up, but very much alive. “Oh stars…” he groans, his voice now audible through the broken glass cage. “Please… don’t eat me…”

Gila smirks, stepping up to get closer. “Ah, good. I was worried it would have been frozen solid before I could have a bite.” Before she can get any closer, I put my arm in her way, blocking her from advancing. “Hey!”

Something’s off. The tone of his voice, the face he is making, they’re not the ones someone who knows they’re arxur chow make. Pupils are not shaking, brow is lightly furrowed, neck and shoulders are relaxed, and even the way he is breathing is slow and steady. There is fear, sure, but not enough. He’s plotting. Waiting.

“Look.” My gun’s muzzle points to the pool of brown liquid surrounding the wrecked exo. I don’t need to take off my mask to know what it is. The engine’s hoses probably broke when it froze, and now the suit is drenched in highly flammable fuel. The gojid has a claw on the ignition, some exposed wiring touching the fuel-covered floor. All it would take is one small push.

Clever, I’ll give him that much.

There are two types of Feds: the cowardly majority, who turn around and run for the hills whenever someone so much as farts in their general direction; and then, there’s the ones like our friend here, the zealots. The ones who will gladly throw their lives away if it means taking some predators with them.

Gila lets out an annoyed hiss, baring her teeth before she steps back. “Fed scum, through and through.”

He looks at us expectantly, not moving an inch, not like he can wiggle around much with that seatbelt on him. I notice a hint of something metallic around his neck, some necklace most likely, but I can’t make out the full shape. He’s not making a sound, but his eyes don’t dare leave our position.

When he notices the arxur backing off, his mouth opens. “Wait! Don’t leave me here!” he begs, looking towards Rick and I. “I know things. I can give you information! Where they’re taking the shipments!”

Heh, that *might* have actually worked on a Provider Pack grunt or some half-starved infantry. Little does he know who he’s dealing with.

“Who wants to do it?” Rick asks as we begin to walk back, putting some distance between us and the pilot’s improvised last stand.

“Rass, you wanna do the honors?” I ask, taking a step back to give him the room. “Seems only fitting, ‘cause you know…”

“Yeah, yeah, eye for an eye…” Rassick takes out a cigar and begins smoking it at a reasonable distance, locking eyes with the trapped gojid.

The space porcupine’s eyes widen suddenly as he takes back his hand from the suit’s controls, fidgeting with his seatbelt to try to unbuckle it. “Fuck you, flesh-eating scum!”

Funny that he’s the last one to notice that the gig is up.

Rass takes a couple good puffs from his smoke before holding it in his claws, admiring the lit tip before flicking it at the pool of the suit’s fuel as the gojid screams some curses our way.

The room’s dim lighting turns a bright orange instantly as the fuel ignites with a roar, blowing a warm gust of air over us, the pilot’s screams adding to the hellish view as the large arxur turns around, pulling out his Oaklies to cover his eyes.

“Let’s bounce, tail’s beginning to itch,” he grumbles, moving towards the elevator. His tail is missing some scales and scutes, the tip bent at the wrong angle.

“How long do we have until it blows?” I ask, trying to ignore the frantic banging coming from the burning exo. Almost on cue, there is a loud boom, ending the gojid’s short-lived suffering at last. Rass gives me a smirk as he presses the cargo elevator’s button, opening the doors.

The trip back to the surface is dreadfully slow, though thankfully lacking in surprises, since we made sure to leave no loose ends on our way in. Gila is dragging a gojid she shanked behind herself with one hand, the other busy holding the leg she’s currently eating.

I know it’s fucked up, but I wouldn’t mind some myself.

Despite their tough hide and blue blood, Gojid taste a lot like Terra’s pork. To make matters worse for them, when properly cooked, they taste like honeyed pork. About the only thing in the Federation’s ranks that is better is tilfish, and those are abundant, even after the fall of Sillis.

If the universe didn’t want us to eat them, it shouldn’t have made them taste like buttered lobster.

I bring a hand to my earpiece, following behind Rick and Rass. “Command, this is Hellion-Delta, charges are set, we’re on our way out.”

“You are ten minutes behind schedule, Hellion-Delta.” Hyvilth replies, her voice thick with contempt. “Status report.”

“We ran into some unexpected opposition. An old exo-suit, one of the workers was inside it. Put up some resistance, but we handled it.”

A soft hum. Not of interest, simply acknowledgement. “The combat data should prove useful. Witnesses?”

“None left. Hellion-Romeo already wiped the surveillance system.” I say, Rick giving me a thumbs up to confirm I’m not talking out of my ass. “Place is rigged to blow, and we already secured the factory’s latest manifesto. Whatever munitions they shipped out last, we’ll know where and how many they sent.”

“Good. Exfiltrate the planet and return to the station. Over and out.” She orders, and as soon as the line goes quiet I sigh in relief.

Rick stretches as we march out of the facility, out into the courtyard. “Man, that was hairy. That thing moved fast for its size.”

“Yeah well, they probably stripped down most of the shielding when they put it to work down there.” I say, more than ready to put this little asteroid behind. “Doubt we’d been able to stop it if it had been a fully armored one.”

“Here’s hoping the Feds don’t get wise about using them. How many heavy troopers do you think it would take to wreck one of those?” Rassick asks as we stop by some trucks. He looks to me, then to the trucks again, and then back to me. “You thinking what I’m thinking?”

“That Gila’s much nicer when she’s got a mouthful of meat to slobber on?” I ask back, our dear albino wiping her mouth with one hand before flipping me off.

“Hah, yeah. But also, wanna take these for a joyride? Beats walking back to the Wonder Jet.” He points at one of the trucks with his thumb as he starts to walk towards it.

“Are you sure you should be driving Rass? You’ve got morphine on your system.” Rick points out.

The large arxur scoffs, shaking his head. “Psh, dude, I’m fine. Don’t be such a stick in the mud. Besides, if it means we can get back to the Bane faster, the better.”

I sigh, raising my goggles to rub my eyes. “Fine, but I’m the one driving.”

“Shotgun!” Rick shouts, moving in to take his preferred seat.

Rassick manages to get the thing to start without a key. According to him, he learned how to hotwire cars while working on his father’s workshop in Key West. I sit behind the wheel, the cabin uncomfortably tight, but still manageable despite the size difference between gojid and humans.

Gila loads her prize on the back and jumps in, helping Rass onto the bed before I step on the gas. It takes some getting used to the torque of the small pickup, but other than driving over a speedbump on our way out, it’s all smooth sailing until we reach the outer perimeter and get on the dirt road.

“Hey, can you spare a bite?” Rassick asks Gila from his seat, pointing at the dead gojid.

“What can you offer in kind?” she asks back with a raised brow, crossing her eyes, her tail coiled protectively around the dead Fed.

“Oh come on, Gila! I’m an injured man!”

“So? That is the product of your own heedlessness. If you had been more careful where you put your tail, we wouldn’t have needed to fight that thing,” she points out, finishing the disembodied leg’s last traces of meat before she starts gnawing on the bone.

“I could introduce you to some guys back at the Bane.” Apparently that was the wrong thing to say, because immediately after Gila begins to hit him with the bone like it’s a club. “Ow! Stop! I’m sorry, okay! Sarge, Gila is being mean to me!”

“You two stop that, or I’m driving this thing back to the parking lot, and making you walk all the way back to the jet!” I grumble while Rick fiddles around with his pad.

The rest of the drive to the jet is slow and bumpy, stopping the truck when we’re close enough. “Alright, everyone out. We also gotta torch this thing, you know how it is.”

Once everyone is out of the truck, I double check to make sure we didn’t leavy anything important behind. With that clear, I grab an incendiary grenade and toss it under the truck, watching the flames begin to spread around it.

“Man, you’re like… a real pyromaniac, Sarge.” Rassick drawls, the secondary effects of the morphine already hitting him as he slouches against a tree. “I’m gonna… I’m going to get you a lighter, for Christmas. One of them nice ones, ya know?”

“You already got me a lighter, Rass. Come on, let’s get you in the ship.” I say while Rick activates the jet’s ramp and it drops down right before us, raising a cloud of dust, before I lead the eight feet and three hundred pounds of drugged-up lizard into the cockpit.

“Why is my tongue so heavy? Like, you ever think about how heavy it is normally?” he asks, eyes half-lidded as I get him to his seat. “Hey, why am I not flying?”

“Because you’re tripping balls.”

“Nah man, I’m…” a yawn interrupts his protests, giving me a faceful of arxur breath that I’m thankful the mask keeps me safe from. “I’m good, just need me some… like, some coffee, is all.”

I can’t help but chuckle as I put his seatbelt on. With him secured, that takes care of one issue. The next is his tail. Once Gila is done putting the gojid in the holding cell, I motion to the wall. “Pass me the FTK.”

She grunts, but obeys without protesting, watching as I put some nitrile gloves on and take out some alcohol and gauze. I may not be able to fix broken bones with this, but I can keep it from getting infected, at least. “I’m gonna need you to hold the tail still.”

Gila rolls her eyes. I wipe some of the wounds with some gauze, spraying alcohol on the bandages before I start wrapping them around Rass’ exposed flesh. “What are you doing back there? It tickles…”

“Can we muzzle him? So the oaf won’t bite his own tongue.” Gila suggests.

I shake my head, speaking up so Rass can hear me. “Just patching you up, big guy.”

“I got hurt?!” he asks, his voice taking on a whiny tone as he shakes in his restraints. “I can’t feel my toes! Am I going to die? Oh God, I’m going to die!”

I snort, glad the mask keeps me from spitting on the wound by accident. “You’ll be fine man.”

Not that my words bring him any comfort, as he begins bawling in his seat. “It’s not fair! I’m too young to dieeeeee!” Rick chortles in his seat, and even Gila lets out an amused chuff as I finish patching Rass’ tail. “Sarge, you gotta… you tell my momma I love her, okay? Promise.”

“You can tell her yourself when you get to Terra,” I assure him with a pat on the shoulder, leaving the crying arxur in his seat, now that he isn’t going to smear blood all over the cockpit’s floor.

Gila’s casually leaning back on her seat by now, holding her pad Rassick’s way with a smirk on her face. “Are you seriously recording him? What are you, twelve?”

She raises an eyebrow and tilts her head. “Why not? He would do the same if I were in his position.”

I mean, yeah, he totally would, but still.

“Besides, he will likely find it amusing later when he comes off the drugs,” she offers, rolling her eyes and putting the pad down. “I swear, you Terrans are soft like fresh clay. You would never catch a Wrissan arxur putting up this kind of shameful display.” She gestures towards Rassick, who right now is fully absorbed inspecting his own hands with the curiosity of a newly hatched.

“Ah yes, because ‘the pain makes you super strong’, or whatever,” I scoff, taking off my mask and walking to my seat. She moves her tail low, and I keep an eye on it to make sure she won’t try to trip me before I sit down. “You better not be thinking to show it to some of your Betterment buddies for a promotion.”

At that, her eyes narrow and her tail slaps the floor right next to my boot. Might have stepped a little too far there. Gila might be one of Betterment’s cloaca-kissing toadies, but even she wouldn’t take kindly to someone implying she’s some Abidance snitch. I raise my hands and offer an apologetic shrug before looking to Rick. “We ready?”

“Yeup. Coordinates are punched in, just need to get out of the planet’s atmosphere,” he confirms as he puts his own datapad down. “You got the detonator?”

I blink a couple times, patting myself to grab the damn thing and finding nothing. A shiver runs down my spine as I sit straight, double-checking and reviewing my last steps, hoping I didn’t leave it in the burning truck.

Before I can think about another possibility, Rassick speaks from behind me. “Don’t worry guys, I got it!” he says cheerily, before a very subtle ‘click’ makes the cockpit go dead silent.

The explosion bathes the night sky orange and green as the amassed payloads begin to go off. Less than a second later, the booming thunder shakes the ground. “Take off! Now!” I order, small debris hitting the jet’s hull before a second explosion goes off.

Rick presses the ignition and begins pulling the yoke back against himself, the jet’s engines working double time as we try to get out of the blast radius. The second shockwave shakes some trees around us, making the whole craft wobble as it rises off the clearing, but the thrusters keep us from being floored.

I’m knocked back onto my seat, clutching to the arm rests as we speed through the woods, knocking more trees down before we gain enough altitude to make the turn towards the sky. I close my eyes and grit my teeth, hearing the inferno we just unleashed grow more and more distant until we finally breach the atmosphere. “I think I peed a little,” Rassick admits from his seat.

This is going to be a very long flight back to the Bane.

He did stick up for Jenny to Mom, but there are other things he ignores.  Jenny complains that she doesn't want to live with the family. Sumit seems quite intent on living with the family. What he can do is listen to Jenny and tell her that he hears her, and to stay the course, be patient, let's save as much money as we can from the cafe as possible, and check in again in the near future. That is what we should hear from Sumit to Jenny.

Instead, we hear him doubling down on what he wants: "" I want to live with the family forever!"" which means they need to have a serious discussion, because they could be heading in different directions if he is not willing to take the steps to make his wife happy, and she is not willing to stay.

The whole ""Jenny not wanting a Boss"" at work or ""taking orders from Mom"" thing. Sumit's solution is to grin and bear it. Sumit should find a way to train her with the coffee machine/money exchange, so Jenny can be the upfront coffee manager herself, so she doesn't need a boss. Otherwise, if she doesn't learn, she will need a boss to teach her things about the machine and the money. So, it's up to Jenny. Does she want to put in the work to understand everything, or does she want a boss? Give her the choice. Does she have the choice to stay home? lol

Yeah, that was me last week. We were in the final sprint for a new feature launch – a pretty cool dashboard that gives users super insights. Everything was *mostly* on track, until… the button.

Sounds trivial, right? Just a 'Download Report' button. But oh no, this button became my personal Everest. The design team wanted it sleek, minimalist, and on the right. Engineering said, ""No can do, chief, not without a major refactor that pushes us two sprints."" Sales was breathing down my neck because they'd already promised clients a prominent, *glowing* button on the *left* for maximum visibility. And users, bless their hearts, just wanted a damn button that worked.

I swear, I spent more time in heated Slack threads and 'quick syncs' about this single button than I did on the entire data architecture. My head felt like it was going to explode. I envisioned myself just screaming, ""IT'S A BUTTON! JUST PUT IT SOMEWHERE!"" The tension was palpable; you could cut it with a dull butter knife. I even started having dreams about buttons. Bright, shiny, accusatory buttons.

Eventually, after what felt like a hundred rounds of negotiation, some strategic data showing where users *actually* look, and a whole lot of coffee, we landed on a compromise. It wasn't exactly what anyone envisioned perfectly, but it was functional, accessible, and didn't derail the launch. The relief was immense, like finally exhaling after holding your breath underwater for way too long.

It was a tiny victory, but it reminded me that product management isn't always about grand visions or innovative features. Sometimes, it's about painstakingly navigating the little things, the seemingly insignificant details, and making sure everyone feels heard even when you're all pulling in slightly different directions. It's a constant tightrope walk, and honestly, sometimes it feels like juggling flaming chainsaws while riding a unicycle.

1q5naug,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1q5naug/disappointed_is_an_understatement/,Disappointed is an understatement,"Currently on Scarlet Lady, and I have been sorely disappointed . To start off, our shower door doesn’t completely seal at the bottom so it creates an absolute mess. A towel can’t even stop the floor from becoming a pond. We made a call to guest services the first day about it along with the issue of our shower drain seemingly being clogged. They did fix the drain but there wasn’t anything they could really do about the door. All restaurants take way too much time to experience. I made all 5:30pm reservations and was always cutting it close to making the 7:30pm show. Refills on drinks were very rare or came when we already finished our meal. The soda machine in the galley is basically flat and a bit watered down. Also, when we arrived on the ship we had a paper with my husband’s name on it, explaining our deep blue extras including a $100 bar tab, laundry service, 2 specialty coffees a day, and a few more. We couldn’t find the $100 bar tab in his Virgin account, so we went to guest services. They said it was a mistake, it was supposed to be put in a different room, and that it’s only for people who have sailed 5x. That’s a pretty big mistake to have printed his name onto the paper. We were hoping they would still give us the $100 bar tab for their mistake, but were offered a bottle of wine. We don’t drink, so they gave us a complimentary “Treat Yourself” selection at any restaurant. Ordered the Grand Plateau at The Wake and used the complimentary Treat Yourself for it. Menu says it includes a whole maine lobster and snow crab claws. Got no claws and the “whole maine lobster” was just a tail. I didn’t care that much because it was still more than enough food, but the menu is misleading/incorrect. The manager of The Wake messaged me about how my experience was afterwards and mentioned the lobster/snow crab dilemma. He messaged back saying that “the lobster dish is only a half portion”. Menu needs to be edited if that’s the case. I would said something in the restaurant during dinner, but since it was complimentary I didn’t feel like causing a problem. Scarlet Night was disappointing and way overhyped. The one day, we decided we would skip having our room ne attended to because we wanted to take a nap. We turned on Do Not Disturb on our door, and took our nap. Unfortunately, we were woken up by our room phone being called and asking us when we would be out of our room so they can do their service. I do understand their possibly concern of us complaining if we don’t get our room cleaned up, but we turned on do not disturb for a reason so we could rest, knowing we’d be missing our bed being made that day. At that point, we were already awake so we just said we’d leave in 20 minutes. The Lolz Supper club comedy was great, but the food was god awful. I ordered my steak medium, it was burnt and I’ve never had a steak that was so chewy. All the restaurant food has been extremely mediocre except for breakfast/brunch at The Wake. So far, we have only seen BOOKED! because Persephone isn’t until tonight, but the production was amazing. Murray Sawchuck’s magic/comedy show is fantastic as well. We even went to see it twice. Overall, out of all the ships I’ve been on (MSC, RC, VV), this has for sure been my least favorite. While staff was kind here, the staff on the other ships go above and beyond. This experience has made me want to rebook with MSC …

Stayed in a gorgeous villa near La Veleta, ate extremely well, and briefly considered never cooking again. Kitchen Market and Hartwood were actually worth the hype, shockingly. Great coffee spots like crazy horse and long time coffee (which was slow as hell and overpriced as they kept running out of the regular beans, so every espresso was like 100 peso).

Then we found the street food. A burrito spot and an Argentinian BBQ near the La Veleta market. That was the real MVP. Like “why did we ever sit down at a table” good.

Food wise, Tulum is easily in the Vegas and Miami league, including the prices unfortunately. Your wallet will feel right at home.

Only real buzzkill was the cops. Driving back from Valladolid to Tulum we hit a checkpoint where an officer decided I was “speeding” which I wasn’t unless the speed limit is now vibes based. He took my license, rummaged through the car, and had my wife empty her bag like we were auditioning for an episode of Border Patrol. We had nothing to hide and they eventually let us go, but yeah, instant mood killer.

We rang in 2026 in a temazcal which was actually awesome and somehow reset the energy. Overall I would 100 percent come back and this will probably replace Vegas as the default friend group trip.

Sure their tactics and warrior ferocity was something to behold, their warships were crude, dull, and sometimes barely held together.

When war finally came to us from an external threat, we captured an enemy ship and did our best to reverse engineer but the threat was from a species and civilization completely new to us. We knew our own tech but this enemy ship was an enigma to us. We didn't understand the tech and couldn't work on it. 

Finally after months of working on it, we brought in a human engineer as a last ditch effort. First, he walked around the ship then examined the closed door then stuck a screw diver into the hole next to the door. The door slid open. We stood there, mouths open. He walked into the ship then sat in the alien chair then looked around. There were no buttons on the console, only thin holes matching the length of the enemies claws. He thought a moment then stuck the screw driver into another hole. Nothing happened. He nodded then stuck the screw driver into another hole and the ship came to life. 

The human engineer did within an hour what we couldn't do in months. When we asked how he did it, he said, ""I don't know how the ship works but I know what it's supposed to do and I know the enemy has claws instead of fingers. We work on stuff that we know nothing about all the time, it never stops us.""

I shook my head, ""That's insane. Human ships look like they're barely held together, we didn't think human engineers were that advanced."" The human smiled sadly, ""Oh we are. There's just usually one or two of us for one ship. Five, if it's a warship.""

We stood there staring in shocked silence. ""Five engineers for one warship?! You need at least 30, we keep 40 to be safe as well as constant supply of material so we don't run low!""

The engineer shrugged, ""Oh we're always low on materials and manpower. We usually hold our ships together with ducktape, toothpicks, and coffee."" 

We left that day with a new found respect for their engineers. Federation engineers have extensive knowledge about how to work on our own ships but need to know what they're working on. Human engineers do not have this handicap.",155,1767716718.0,humansarespaceorcs,5,0.99,False

1q5n37n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1q5n37n/weird/,Weird,"I genuinely feel that people around me can tell that I’m on SR, in some mystical/cosmic way.

It’s shocking.

When I’m not retaining, the people in my house will always try to talk to me, or even ask questions about my life.

But when I’m retaining on anything longer than 4 days, people will literally come up around me, and make noises.

I’m 23 and stay with my mom (complicated reasons, I had a really bad head injury 4 ish years ago and I’ve had a hard time working since, so I stopped working over a year ago and I’m trying to get better through CBT and my GP). 

My mom will become very controlling, and she will start to repeatedly cough, extremely loudly, almost everytime I walk into the hallway outside of my room.

I know that sounds crazy, or like I’m trying to merely “make sense” of annoying things, but it’s a weird synchrony.

And my older brother (loser, chooses not to work and my mom puts up with it) will literally start getting in my face, and start almost singing/talking to himself but it seems directed at me to push my buttons.

And sometimes all of these annoyances work on me, but I’m trying hard to overcome it.

Last year I did a 6-8 month streak, and something insane happened. My brother called the cops on me and lied to them, saying I assaulted him. And the cops took me to the psych ward, and I was there for almost 3 weeks. And I was LOSING MY SHIT, saying I’m going to sue them, because they would seclude me in a white room for over a day at a time, and force meds on me (even though I was deemed capable of making decisions, and they coerced me into things), and a bunch of other things. And ONLY WHEN I JERKED OFF, they said they’d let me out the next day.

It seems so ridiculous, but it feels like I become a target whenever I start retaining, and the longer I do, the crazier the attacks on me become.

I don’t get it, and I feel hopeless a lot of the time.

I often lose my streak willfully, because I don’t want to hold the burden, or because I simply “stop believing”.

But this year I’m starting on a new chapter. And I’m going to go for a few years, and hopefully God will give me the strength and courage to get away from the people around me, and start something new.

My family has been horrible toward me my whole life. My Dad threw me out at 19 (I lived with him 15-19) right after the head injury, and he sucker punched me in the back of the head, and I lived in the heat and the cold, working a cash job at a tire shop. Then I lived on a farm, and survived off of farmed chickens and instant coffee and stuff like that, with a great friend of mine. 

And then my father mentor died (Dads best friend), and I just became like, heartbroken, but I didn’t cry. I just became numb. And I left my friends farm and went to stay with my mom. I retained mostly throughout my whole homelessness journey.

So yeah. I read a lot of people experiencing positive experiences or attraction, and for me I just become a fucking target and people just want to ruin my life. Fuck my Dad, fuck my “Brother”, fuck everyone.

My life fucking sucks. But I’m still going to retain, and do fasted workouts every morning because I don’t give a single fuck anymore. And no one can beat me up. I know that. I’m literally too strong. Football + rugby + working out everyday from 13-19, then high rise construction and tire shop + farm work until 20-21. And a lot of that was done while retaining.

So the world can try to take me down, I don’t give a fuck. ",19,1767716521.0,Semenretention,15,0.83,False
