Turns out he ended up liking/trying on more clothes than me. We went past this one shop that had a beautiful bodycon maxi strapless coffee brown dress and i can't explain how much i loved it when i tried it on.

A little backstory, I come from a relatively conservative family that doesn't appreciate such kind of clothes worn publicly. If i did buy this dress then it would rot in my cupboard because my mother would not let me wear it in a cab alone, or outside. So I do feel a little rebellious or even resentful when I can't wear such clothes but my friends openly do.

I'm 18, in last year of school.

Anyway so, before I asked my mom if I could buy the dress, me and bf brainstormed over where I would wear this dress to which I said our 12th Farewell After Party. Now the after party is wuite wild lol lots of stupid boys, underaged drinking, unwanted touching (esp from drunk ppl), music and dj at a club. It is overall safe if you're in a good group of friends.

The first thing my bf said to that was 'There's no way I'm letting you wear that to conti'. Which made me ??? until he repeated it again. Made me say Who's letting You choose anything. But that would have ruined both our moods and I was anyway going to keep it back because my mom said no.

I was visibly upset after, not entirely because of what bf said but mostly because I'm never allowed those kind of clothes.

Bf did like something on the 2nd level, even tried it on but refused to get it because I couldn't get anything (the dress) and in that instant he loved me so much that he wanted to buy me something so it was a hurried trip to a coffee and then told me to pick flowers with him at a shop (missed the one i wanted and got roses instead because he was running late)
I would've liked it but was it that necessary if he anyway wasn't planning on giving it time, just seemed like he wanted to get Something regardless of the thought lol.

It's been a week and i still think about what he said about me wearing that dress, I know he meant well but the wording is such an ick for me right now.
I brought it up and he got mad because I always bring things up way after it's happened and says I should have mentioned it on the day itself. (I have a chronic problem of not bringing up something when it happens, instead pondering for weeks then bringing it up when the other person has likely forgotten)

Me and him started very smoothly, we both live in Pakistan and so one day we decided to meet out of nowhere and after few coffee meetups like literally in a month he asked me to meet his mother and that he insisted on sending rishta. Honestly the way his actions were i honestly fell for him. Everything wuth him was smooth and honestly sometiems i used to stop and wonder that its too good to be true but anyways i wanted to keep good gumaan so i had to divert my thinking. He was amazing at the start. So i met his mother and later i asked him to meet my brother because he apparently this guy makes music so i needed a support from home. Anyways my brother and family were very supportive and he immediately wanted to send rishta without any wait and also asked my father if it was possible to give his answer early because of some personal reasons (i knew about the reasons) everything went well we got engaged in under 2 months. Basically we never had a relationship we decided to just do the baat pakki first and then move forward. Anyways after 3 months he started acting very strange due to some reasons which i got to know just before our breakup. It was aziat honestly i used to cry every night every morning because he wasnt there. He was not giving me time or any details let alone we couldnt even talk. It was always something. (I am not saying he must be lying or whatever because i know he makes music so he must be very busy but the fact it was happening every single day and his actions felt like as if he is cheating or he is not interested anymore) Later when my parents got worried including me so that was an alarming sigh that there were no involvement from his side so when i insisted i got to know the reasons and turned out he is facing some financial crisis to which he predicted that i wont be able to adjust in his family 😭😭😂😭😂😭😂. I mean. This man did not have a plan or anything and he thought financial crisis can never be upon him? I was fucking ready to adjust man. (Please dont say he was concerned how will i be able to adjust because he should've thought about this before he sent rishta) he basically refused to marry me and ghosted me. I am still ghosted. Well i said what i had to say he didnt even say about breaking up on his own his father made a call 😂😂😂😭😂😂😭😭. He wasnt man enough to confront me or deal with me. Anyways the day it ended he was promoting his songs 😭😭😭😂😂😂😭😭😂. This man was so immature he couldnt even come to me or apologize. Please dont say he was embarrassed because wtf man?????

I'm 34, from Spain ☀️, now voluntarily freezing in Belgium. Life choices? Questionable. Regrets? Not many

175 cm, slim and fit

I enjoy reading (news, books, webtoons), anything with an engine 🏍️, working out (mostly so I can eat more meat), traveling to unique places, grilling, beaches, BBQs, and chess. Or just chilling at home with a movie and popcorn.
I don’t play videogames anymore but I fully support those who do😉.


50% honesty, 50% sarcasm, and 100% the person who will tease you right before bringing you breakfast.


I know what I want in life and I go after it, but I also enjoy the ride. I like learning random things, figuring out how stuff works, and keeping my mind busy… call it curiosity, or a fun waste of time.


Not a fan of small talk. I wanna talk about atoms, death, aliens, the moon, magic, intellect, the meaning of life, faraway galaxies, the lies you've told, your flaws, your favorite scents, your childhood, what keeps you up at night, your insecurities, and fears. I like people with depth, who speak from emotion from a slightly twisted mind.

I like sarcasm and playful teasing. I'd say I am a child at heart but also a fully functioning adult 😜.

Oh, and coffee without sugar. But when it comes to dating, I like it sweet, no games.

As someone who’s been *blessed* with an impressive collection of adult toys (we all have our hobbies, right?), I can confidently say this one has earned a permanent spot in my nightstand.

First off, the design. It’s sleek, discreet, and not the “what the heck is that?” kind of weird when you leave it out. I didn’t have to hide it under the pillow, and trust me, that's a win. Plus, it comes with some attachments—let me tell you, this thing’s versatility rivals that of a Swiss Army knife. There's a reason it's considered one of the *best female masturbators* around, and trust me, I’m all about efficiency.

Let’s get to the important part—how it works. I took this for a test run (because, who doesn’t want to?). It has multiple speeds and modes, so you’re basically in control of how *intense* things get. It’s like switching between Netflix binge-watching and a full-on Marvel movie marathon. The power behind this is next-level! I won’t go into TMI territory (we all know what we're here for), but let’s just say... it did NOT disappoint. If you're looking for something that gets you there without dragging it out like a bad date, the Tracy’s Dog Wand is the answer.

**BTW I Got Mine For Really Cheap** [**HERE**](https://amzn.to/4hE55d1)

Here’s a fun comparison: imagine you're making pancakes. Some vibrators are like the sad, uneven pancakes you make at 8 AM when you haven’t had your coffee yet. The Tracy’s Dog Wand? That’s like the perfectly golden, fluffy pancake you get at brunch on a Sunday morning. Consistent, smooth, and leaving you *satisfied*.

Also, the battery life is impressive, and trust me, I’ve had my share of “oops, forgot to charge” moments. This one kept going, and going, and I actually had to stop before it did! (Not a bad problem to have).

Long story short, if you're looking for the [best female masturbator](https://amzn.to/4hE55d1) that’s powerful, reliable, and downright enjoyable, do yourself a favor and get the Tracy’s Dog Wand Vibrator Kit.

1isba13,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsreviewed/comments/1isba13/honestly_best_female_vibrator/,[HONESTLY] Best Female Vibrator,"Okay, let me just start by saying I’ve tried my fair share of vibrators. From the ones that sound like a lawn mower in need of a tune-up to the ones that barely give any buzz, I’ve seen it all. But then, I stumbled upon the [Satisfyer Pro 2 Vibrator Sex Toy](https://amzn.to/4hDyCDy), and *y’all*, it’s like the heavens opened and the angels started clapping. This thing is a game changer.

I don’t usually write reviews like this (I swear), but after using this vibrator for the past few weeks, I feel like it’s my duty to share the joy. It’s literally the **best female vibrator** I’ve ever owned, and trust me, I’m picky. I’ve got high standards when it comes to my pleasure, and this little device ticks every box.

# First Impressions:

The first thing I noticed was how sleek it looks. It’s not a weird, bulky device that’ll make you feel like you’re about to assemble an IKEA bookshelf (seriously, some of them are *that* bad). It’s compact, ergonomic, and feels luxurious in the hand. I don’t want to sound dramatic, but just holding it made me feel like I was about to experience something special.

**BTW I Got Mine For Really Cheap** [**HERE**](https://amzn.to/4hDyCDy)

# The Magic of Air-Pulse Technology:

Now, the real reason I’m writing this review: the air-pulse technology. This is the feature that sets the **Satisfyer Pro 2** apart from the rest. It’s not your average vibration – it’s a gentle yet powerful suction-like feeling that *mimics the sensation of oral stimulation*. I’m not exaggerating here; the first time I used it, I was like, “Wait, am I actually in a rom-com right now? Is this what it feels like when a perfect match happens in a movie?” Seriously, it’s *that* good.

# Real-Life Example:

Okay, let me be real with you. Last week, I had a bit of a stressful day. Work was a mess, I couldn’t get my coffee to taste right (don’t judge me, coffee is serious business), and I was just generally *not* in a good mood. But then, I decided to take a little self-care moment and try out the Satisfyer Pro 2 again.

Within minutes, I had forgotten all about my awful day. I’m talking about a deep, almost zen-like relaxation. *Your girl was floating in a cloud of pleasure.* I honestly couldn’t believe how effective this thing is. I’m not saying I reached Nirvana, but let’s just say the stress melted away, and I had a *much* better evening.

# The Silent Power:

Something else I love about the [Satisfyer Pro 2](https://amzn.to/4hDyCDy) is how quiet it is. We’ve all been there – trying to keep things discreet because, well, life happens. This bad boy is whisper-quiet, so you can enjoy your “me-time” without worrying that your neighbors are gonna start wondering if you’re having a rave in your bedroom.

# The Verdict:

If you’re on the hunt for the **best female vibrator**, look no further than the **Satisfyer Pro 2 Vibrator Sex Toy**. It’s the perfect combination of sleek design, high-tech air-pulse stimulation, and total discretion. Seriously, I’ve tried a lot of different toys, and none have compared to this. If you’re looking for a toy that’s both powerful and sophisticated, this is it.

Treat yourself—you won’t regret it. And to anyone who thinks they’ve tried the best already... well, you just haven’t tried this one yet.

*Pro tip: If you can, use it during a bath for the ultimate relaxation experience. It’s like a spa day, but better.*",1,1739880701.0,redditsreviewed,0,1.0,False
1isb9sa,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsreviewed/comments/1isb9sa/honestly_best_female_vibrator_wand/,[HONESTLY] Best Female Vibrator Wand,"Alright, folks, buckle up, because I’m here to tell you about the *best female vibrator wand* I’ve ever tried – the [Ava Vibrator Wand Sex Toys \[Clit Stimulator Vibrators\].](https://amzn.to/3ESHgiV) I didn’t expect to be this excited about a piece of adult “technology” (hey, it’s not a gadget you casually talk about with your friends), but this one really knocked my socks off… and everything else too, honestly.

I’ve tried my fair share of vibrators, from the palm-sized ones to the “does this thing even fit in my drawer?” type, but the Ava wand? Oh, it’s next level.

# Design & Comfort:

Let’s start with the design. It’s sleek, stylish, and a lot less intimidating than some of the wands that look like they could double as home improvement tools. The handle is ergonomic, so no cramping or awkward wrist positions after 10 minutes of use. You know how some wands feel like you're holding onto a brick? Not the Ava. It’s surprisingly lightweight and easy to maneuver, which is a big plus. No need to take out a second mortgage to afford a good product *and* a chiropractor.

# Power & Performance:

Now, let’s talk about the power. *Whew.* The first time I turned it on, I half-expected it to start humming the theme song to ""Jaws"" — that’s how strong the vibrations are. This thing packs a punch, and I’m not talking about a mild buzz. The **Clit Stimulator** feature is no joke either — it targets exactly where you need it to, and I’m pretty sure I got to places I didn’t even know existed.

Real talk: I once had to pause midway to collect myself. I was getting flashbacks of that one time I tried to multitask while using the vacuum cleaner (never again). It wasn’t just about the pleasure; it was almost *too* much. In the best way. If you’re looking for a deep, satisfying experience, look no further.

**BTW I Got Mine For Really Cheap** [**HERE**](https://amzn.to/3ESHgiV)

# Real Life Example:

Let me paint a picture: I was trying to get some work done one afternoon when I saw the Ava sitting there, looking like the innocent wand it is. Naturally, I had to try it out for a “quick break.” Long story short, I’m not sure how much work actually got done that day. I’ll just say I was really productive in a *different* way.

# Ease of Use & Maintenance:

It’s also super easy to clean, which is a huge deal for me. I like to treat my toys like my coffee maker: clean them after every use, and don’t forget about them for weeks. A quick wipe down, and it’s good as new. Bonus points for being waterproof — I don’t even need to worry if it slips into the tub or shower. It’s like they thought of everything.

# Conclusion:

All in all, the [Ava Vibrator Wand](https://amzn.to/3ESHgiV) has totally earned its spot in my drawer (and no, it’s not getting pushed to the back like some of those other toys that never lived up to the hype). If you’re on the hunt for the **best female vibrator wand**, this is your sign to grab one. It’s effective, easy to use, and will absolutely elevate your experience. Plus, it doesn’t come with a “learning curve.” Seriously, it’s just plug and play... or vibe and play? You get the idea.

Then I went and sat with my mother and she wouldn't touch me. I started to see white worms swimming under the skin of my right arm, small ones like maggots. They broke the surface of my skin. They were bright pearly white and less than an inch long. They formed together into masses of white paste.

I started scraping off the white worms and they broke back apart into little worms and burrowed back under my skin, one I saw go into a vein and be carried away in my blood.

Then I looked at my left arm and thousands of long thin hair-like black stranded worms were coming out of my skin. I was terrified and I tried to pull them, as I pulled them they became thick and long. I pulled out two, and asked my mom to help me. She said ""why would you ask me for that?"" And then I woke up crying.",1,1739880171.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False
1isb4lr,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1isb4lr/my_husbands_m31_personality_changed_completely/,My Husband’s (M/31) personality changed completely from a loving caring person to a distant roommate for me (F/26). How do i address this?,"Hi, sorry for the long post. 

Some context: I met my husband when I was 16 through a mutual friend group. We started off slow, but after about 3-4 months of hanging out, we entered into a relationship. After five years, I moved to Canada for university, and he came along as a tourist to help me settle in. He also has extended family here. I didn’t know anybody when I immigrated, and it made me feel vulnerable, so I accepted his help. Initially, he planned to stay 4-5 months and then return home. However, due to COVID, he got stuck in Canada because of the lockdown and proposed that we get married so he could legally stay here and work to support both of us. I hesitated because I was only 22, but he assured me that it was okay for me to take my time to think. Long story short, we got married in a small ceremony and applied for a specific visa/permit for him. He received his permit, started working, and everything seemed to be going well until his parents came to visit.

We had different bank accounts but never had issues with money; he paid for all fixed expenses like rent, the car loan, and insurance, while I took care of food and outings. I never thought about sharing expenses 50/50. His parents’ visit began okay but turned awkward after a month. They started making hurtful remarks disguised as jokes, such as saying they didn’t agree with our civil marriage rather than a traditional Indian one. They never asked us to marry according to our traditions, though. Once, his dad told me that girls used to ask for my husband’s number and that he never imagined he’d get married to me here. He suggested my husband would have found a more suitable wife. My husband was there and felt uncomfortable but didn’t intervene. I was upset and told him that it was an offensive and derogatory comment. He told me his dad was just like that and not to pay attention to his comments. I insisted it shouldn't happen again, and he promised to speak to him about it.

I had to return to India for an emergency, and during my absence, his mom was staying with my husband. When I came back, she started acting strangely towards me, making comments that I was lazy, and even cutting me off during conversations. She suggested my husband leave me at home while they went out to see his extended family. After six strange months, his mom finally left. I was confused about everything and expressed this to my husband, but he brushed it off. 

Then my husband began acting differently, asking me to pay for half of everything, including the car that was in my name, even though we didn’t need it as he had gotten his own car. I questioned his sudden change in attitude, but for the sake of our relationship, I complied. I understood that starting in a new country is difficult and expensive, but things became intentionally hurtful when I fell sick and couldn’t cook. He told me it was my responsibility to cook, and since I didn’t, I was responsible for takeout. Every time we went out to eat, he insisted I pay because I chose not to cook that day.

Things escalated when I lost my job. He did not support me and told me to sell my car if I couldn’t afford it and manage my share of everything, even without a job. I retaliated, reminding him that I am his wife and that he should be more considerate while I look for new work. I lost my job due to my immigration status expiring. His parents, sister, and he began to pressure me mentally, constantly saying that I wouldn’t have survived without his support and that I wasn’t a good wife and he should have married someone better.

My husband had been unemployed in India and never completed high school, while I hold two bachelor's degrees and work in corporate. He works long hours in catering, and they blamed me for not understanding that my job isn’t as demanding because I sit in an office for eight hours while he endures 12-16 hour shifts with constant walking around. I don’t understand why I am being blamed for this.

Present day: I am in the process of obtaining my residency in Canada and couldn’t include him in my application due to his low scores resulting from a lack of education and work experience. Although my husband agreed to this decision, he now seems irritated, and his parents continually make hurtful comments to me. 

Yesterday was our fifth wedding anniversary, and his parents didn’t wish me well. When I asked him to take me out for a coffee date, he made excuses. There were no gifts, no cake, and no celebration. I feel deeply betrayed and hurt that the loving, caring boyfriend I once had is now the source of my distress.

I have been in a 10-year relationship that I once imagined would be filled with love, care, and laughter. Instead, it has become a source of constant anxiety and panic attacks. ",2,1739880165.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

In this structure, the subject is followed by the verb.

*Examples:*

* 나는 걸어요. (naneun georeoyo) – I walk.
* 지훈이가 자요. (jihuniga jayo) – Jihoon sleeps.
* 나의 엄마는 요리해요. (naui eommaneun yorihaeyo) – My mom cooks.

**2. Subject + Object + Verb (S + O + V)**

Korean typically follows a Subject-Object-Verb order, differing from English's Subject-Verb-Object structure.

*Examples:*

* 나는 수학을 공부해요. (naneun suhageul gongbuhaeyo) – I study math.
* 그는 축구 경기를 봐요. (geuneun chukgu gyeonggireul bwayo) – He watches a soccer match.
* 나의 엄마는 파스타를 요리해요. (naui eommaneun paseutareul yorihaeyo) – My mom cooks pasta.

**3. Subject + Noun/Adjective (S + N/A)**

This pattern is used to indicate a state of being or existence.

*Examples:*

* 나의 아빠는 화학자예요. (naui appaneun hwahakjayeyo) – My dad is a chemist.
* 나는 졸려요. (naneun jollyeoyo) – I am sleepy.
* 이 커피는 뜨거워요. (i keopineun tteugeowoyo) – This coffee is hot.

**Note on Sentence Endings:**

When a sentence ends with a noun, use ""예요"" (yeyo) if the noun ends in a vowel, and ""이에요"" (ieyo) if it ends in a consonant.

*Examples:*

* 지수는 고등학생이에요. (jisuneun godeunghaksaengieyo) – Jisu is a high school student.
* 이 분은 저희 아버지예요. (i buneun jeohui abeojiyeyo) – This is my father.

Mastering these basic structures will provide a strong foundation for constructing sentences in Korean.

COFFEE

i met my younger self for coffee
we got there at the same time
probably cause not much has changed for me

we're still living in a movie
where the nightmare just plays, on repeat 
probably cause i didn't try hard enough to change 

and that's strange to me, cause normally hard work means the power to succeed
and if you bleed then that normally means that you're definitely in the lead 
but what goes up has to come down,  at some point
and now i think about it, that's probably why i don't get that high at all...


i met my current self for coffee 
she was scared to think about who she really was
probably cause she never formed an identity 
living off what other people thought of me.. 

she sits and lies right to my face
when i ask her how she really was coping
i think about those i pushed away
i blame myself, but i really was hoping someone would stay 

might sound selfish but i try!
i question my own mortality
they say its normal
as if that would help 

and im not saying that people don't have it worse!
but if there's nothing wrong with me 
then why does it still hurt! 

i meet my future self for coffee
she looks at me with doubt in her eyes
i ask her millions of questions
anxious to see if we did get by 

but she can't answer because the future's not happened
so i sit there in dismay
did i expect her to tell me it would be okay?
i wish she did
but would i listen anyway? 

because in my brain there are soldiers!!
fighting impossible wars!!
they may win a couple battles
but is anybody keeping score? 


i walk alone to get a coffee
a million thoughts rush through my head
thousands of people all around, just like me
do they even feel the dread?
am i alone or am i lonely?
do they all feel the same?
i walk alone to get a coffee
alone in person and alone in my head


there!! hope u likey and if you don't well also lnk

Whether you run a local café, a law firm, or an e-commerce store, your potential customers are searching for your services online. This is where Mississauga SEO comes into play. 

If you’re a business owner in Mississauga, understanding and implementing SEO strategies tailored to your local audience can give you a significant edge over competitors. 

Let’s explore why **Mississauga SEO** is essential and how you can leverage it to grow your business.

**Why Is SEO Important for Mississauga Businesses?**

Mississauga is one of Canada’s fastest-growing cities, with a thriving economy and a diverse consumer base. With such a competitive business environment, standing out online is no longer optional—it’s a necessity. Here’s why:

1. Increased Local Visibility

When someone searches for a product or service in Mississauga, Google prioritizes local businesses in search results. If your website is not optimized for local SEO, you’re missing out on potential customers. Ranking high in local search results ensures that your business is easily found by people looking for what you offer.

2. Higher Website Traffic and Conversions

SEO isn’t just about getting more visitors to your site; it’s about attracting the right audience. When your site ranks well for relevant keywords like “best coffee shop in Mississauga” or “Mississauga SEO services,” you attract users who are genuinely interested in your products or services. This leads to higher conversion rates and increased revenue.

3. Competitive Advantage

Many businesses in Mississauga still rely on traditional marketing methods. While those can be effective, SEO provides a long-term competitive advantage by keeping your brand visible 24/7. If your competitors are investing in SEO and you’re not, you risk losing potential customers to them.

**How to Improve Your Mississauga SEO Strategy?**

Now that we understand why SEO is important, let’s dive into some actionable strategies to help your business rank higher in local search results.

1. Optimize Your Google My Business Listing

One of the most effective ways to improve local SEO is by optimizing your Google My Business (GMB) profile. This ensures that your business appears in Google’s local pack, maps, and search results.

* Ensure your business name, address, and phone number (NAP) are accurate and consistent across all platforms.
* Choose the right categories and add high-quality images.
* Encourage satisfied customers to leave positive reviews.

2. Focus on Local Keywords

Keywords are the foundation of any SEO strategy. To target the Mississauga market, include location-based keywords naturally throughout your website content.

Examples of local keywords:

* “Best digital marketing agency in Mississauga”
* “Affordable SEO services in Mississauga”
* “Mississauga SEO expert”

Using these keywords in your website’s headings, meta descriptions, and content will help improve local rankings.

3. Create High-Quality Local Content

Content marketing is a powerful tool for boosting SEO. By creating valuable, locally focused content, you can attract and engage your audience while improving your rankings.

4. Build Local Backlinks

Backlinks (links from other websites to yours) play a crucial role in SEO. Acquiring backlinks from reputable Mississauga-based websites can improve your domain authority and search rankings.

5. Ensure Mobile-Friendliness and Fast Loading Speed

Most users today browse the internet from mobile devices. If your website isn’t mobile-friendly, you could be losing potential customers. Google also considers page speed as a ranking factor, so ensure your site loads quickly and offers a seamless user experience.

6. Leverage Social Media for Local Engagement

While social media doesn’t directly impact SEO rankings, it helps drive traffic to your website and builds brand authority. Platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn allow you to engage with the Mississauga community, promote your content, and attract local customers.

**Choosing the Right Mississauga SEO Company**

If SEO sounds overwhelming, hiring a professional [Mississauga SEO](https://www.thirdeyedesigners.com/mississauga-seo/) agency can be a smart investment. An experienced SEO agency can:

* Conduct in-depth keyword research and competitor analysis.
* Optimize your website for local searches.
* Create a tailored content strategy.
* Build high-quality backlinks to improve rankings.
* Monitor performance and adjust strategies for continuous growth.

When selecting an SEO agency, look for one with a proven track record, positive client testimonials, and experience in local SEO.

**The Summary**

**Mississauga SEO** is more than just ranking higher on Google—it’s about connecting with your local audience, building trust, and driving business growth. As you implement the right SEO strategies, you can enhance your online presence, attract more customers, and stay ahead of the competition.

Whether you choose to optimize your website on your own or hire an expert, investing in SEO is one of the best decisions you can make for your business in Mississauga. Start today and watch your brand thrive in the digital space!

I have a doctors appointment tomorrow but just wondered if anyone had similar symptoms and what it turned out to be?

I’m four months pp and baby is going about four hours between feeds overnight which is great but I have been waking up every hour the last week. 

It started a few weeks ago where I noticed I was waking up before her and that was every two-three hours, then I’d fall asleep and be almost instantly jogged awake again. Now I can’t even fall asleep or nap during the day so it’s getting really scary/dangerous.

 I have been taking a multivitamin that tbh is quite lacking - doesn’t contain magnesium or calcium so I just switched today to one that covers more nutrients. I also take extra vitamin d (I live in Berlin so there’s basically no sun September-March), extra omega three and occasionally taking extra amino acids. I drink around 3 litres water a day plus different teas but no coffee and only one tea with caffeine in the morning.

I’m thinking this must be a hormonal issue as it seems to be getting gradually worse.. I also have gained a lot of weight post partum (I was 75kg, went up to 100kg during pregnancy, now 89kg), have hair loss and fatigue, also hot flashes/ night sweats when my husband is freezing.

Feels like just before my period but it’s been like this probably three/four weeks and no sign of the red army.

I’ve also tried a homeopathic sleep remedy which helped at first but now doesn’t, as well as a little melatonin which has also stopped working.

i have been struggling with premature ejaculation since I've had my first sexual encounter at 21 

I have also been suffering from an irritable bladder since my teenage years. Both my mom and dad are diabetic and their parents were too. My blood sugar levels are normal.

But I need to urinate frequently throughout the day, despite not hydrating myself too much. I used to drink black coffee, but I have stopped recently. Even half a tablespoon of coffee makes my bladder irritable, causing the urge to pee. 

When I have an erection, my bladder becomes irritated again. This issue is worse when I wake up in the morning with both morning wood and a full bladder. Even slight pressure below my abdomen can trigger ejaculation.

I am afraid I might never have the luxury of having spontaneous sex with my partner. I have to always plan, make sure I am not too hydrate, have a control over anxiety.  

I spoke to a doctor about this, he suggested I might have an UTI and prescribed antibiotics. Clearly that wasn't it. 

I have also tried some substances, they help me last longer but I don't want to get hooked on to them and want to enjoy sex naturally.

*RANT**

Yes it's me again. The same person who wrote the I give up post a few days ago. 
I just want to say thank you to everyone who commented and it's honestly reassuring to know that there are people like me out there who 'could' tick all the box and yet... Baby wouldn't sleep through the night (I know 12 hours is rare ... I'm aiming 11 hours but I'll take 10 hours .. I would even take 8 hours tbh) 

Yes my LO is able to go to sleep independently. Goes from awake ( eyes wide open ) to sleep. 

We have moved our own mattress to the living room so that he gets his own room ( shared in the previous post )--> The first time we ever did that * the same day I wrote the I give up post ... Guess what? He slept from 8pm- 4am straight. 

We honestly thought we pieced the last piece of jigsaw puzzle. I wanted to buy coffee for the sleep train sub moderators. 

We re did the black out curtains like I mentioned in the previous post. 

For 2 nights he slept till 4am straight... I nursed him... He burped and slept till 7am.

 I felt like I came alive from being dead. 

But I guess like all good things in life... Every good thing comes to an end... From the third night... Once again... Goes to sleep independently.... But the night wakings happen .. and we wait. We don't run in straight away... We wait for 5 mins cause that's what sleep training is about right? We do the waits and all .... But nope LO cries hysterically.... If you know, you know.... He gets riled up.... And the thing is have we changed anything? 
Wakes up 3/4 times?.. 
Am I suppose to cap his nap even shorter? 

I only nurse him once-->  after 3am. 
He eats very well. Solids x2. 
EBF. 

 The same routine ... The same room... The same temp of the AC .. ..
The same WWs.... The same everything... So tell me what's wrong now? 

DWT 7AM. 
DBT 8PM. 

2/2.5/2.5/3

Tried 2 naps. Too many false starts. 

First nap 30mins. 
Second nap 1hr 20 mins.
Third nap 30 mins. 

Night routine is 
Solids. Boob. Burp. Bath. Book. Swaddle. Bed. 
There is a solid 30 min from Boob to Bed. 

I think by the time I get his sleep sorted... It will be his first day of his grade 1.

I’m four months pp and baby is going about four hours between feeds overnight which is great but I have been waking up every hour the last week. 

It started a few weeks ago where I noticed I was waking up before her and that was every two-three hours, then I’d fall asleep and be almost instantly jogged awake again. Now I can’t even fall asleep or nap during the day so it’s getting really scary/dangerous.

 I have been taking a multivitamin that tbh is quite lacking - doesn’t contain magnesium or calcium so I just switched today to one that covers more nutrients. I also take extra vitamin d (I live in Berlin so there’s basically no sun September-March), extra omega three and occasionally taking extra amino acids. I drink around 3 litres water a day plus different teas but no coffee and only one tea with caffeine in the morning.

I’m thinking this must be a hormonal issue as it seems to be getting gradually worse.. I also have gained a lot of weight post partum (I was 75kg, went up to 100kg during pregnancy, now 89kg), have hair loss and fatigue, also hot flashes/ night sweats when my husband is freezing.

Feels like just before my period but it’s been like this probably three/four weeks and no sign of the red army.

I’ve also tried a homeopathic sleep remedy which helped at first but now doesn’t, as well as a little melatonin which has also stopped working.

JENNIE - Her recent mv views are really slow and not really charting well compared to her previous releases. Is it just me or is she losing her charisma lately? Something is really off, I just cant pinpoint what it is. 

LISA - Eventhough she collabed with Doja and Raye, Born Again is not doing well in charts and views, compared to Lalisa that gained 70m or sumthin during its first 24 hrs. The only good thing about Born Again is its her best song up to date, its something Michael Jackson would sing. She should also sing live coz it tarnishes her reputation btw, she had time to act, so as an idol, she should make time for vocal lessons as well.  She is also losing her charisma by trying a lot of things and creating cringey alter egos. 

JISOO - Although not that impactful, her mv views are quite good and stable. Its very obvious that she only released a music to stop the demands of her fans, coz everybody knows that she is more into acting rather than singing. 

ROSÉ - She really did well with Apt, and although Bruno played a huge factor for it to reach a wider audience, the fact that Rosé pitched in 3 songs and handed it to Bruno for him to collab is already a great feat, getting recognized and getting mentored by Bruno is such a huge achievement itself. Apt is really catchy and people from all ages enjoy it, even babies. Although some of the songs in her album is quite boring but I totally enjoyed Apt, Stay a Little Longer, Number One Girl, TTTE, 3am, Vampirehollie, & Drinks and Coffee. She should get out of her ballad type songs because her voice suits pop rock so much. 

 Among the 4 of them, I think Rosé made more waves in the west, and she did the right move by not creating her own label and signed under the more established Atlantic Records. In that way, she can have more connections and proper guidance under the already established label.  I think the rest of the girls are having a hard time in their own labels, like Jennie & Lisa.

1isa56t,https://i.redd.it/20ak2cfupvje1.jpeg,A rant about study setups from a chronic nerd,"I’ve been seeing a lot of posts about study set ups. For context I’m a doctor, I’ve studied my ass off longer than some of you have been alive for. From 3 hours everyday to 16 hours. 
The worst was when I pulled all nighters back to back for two weeks straight with 4 hours of sleep in between. Don’t do that, it’s stupid. 

Anyway I’m not gloating, what I’m trying to say is, whatever your study set up is, it doesn’t matter. What you get out of it does. 
As you can see, I’m currently studying on the floor rn even though I have a desk. It’s good to keep changing your study places because studying itself is boring. 
Some people do not get motivated with organised spaces or coloured stationary. If that’s not you, then don’t force it. 

And stop making fun of people who come from less privileged backgrounds than you. It screams classism. 

So here are some of my tips 
Buy a box of cheap pens and notebooks. Use that to jot down your ideas and concept maps. 
Set a forest timer for 3 hours max because that’s the amount of time your brain can truly focus on one thing and that alone.

1. We have billboards in every region of the US and looking to expand internationally (picture this morning in Times Square)
2. We are creating a “Toshimon” video game along with many different forms of apparel, stickers etc
3. Trying to incorporate into small businesses! A member of our community is trying to get their coffee shop to link a wallet to incorporate discounts for coffee (for example, 2-3 USD worth of Toshi for coffee maybe).

1is9zin,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1is9zin/this_ladys_bo_made_employees_sick/,This Lady's B.O. made employees sick,"It has been 2 years since this incident, but I alluded to it in one of my previous posts. To this day I think back on what happened with this stay and wonder. Just, wonder how this poor lady is doing. I hope she found the help she needs, but our place was not equipped to help her.

This happened in spring of 2023, while I was still fairly new to the Front Desk. It was a rare night where we were nearly sold out, and I had support on the FD with a coworker to handle the busy traffic. Around 10pm, we had only a couple of arrivals left, and I was the runner for the night and delivering linen. It was time we have to close the pool, so I was away from the desk for about 10 minutes.

Upon my return, I see one of our luggage carts stacked to the brim with roughly 12 black trash bags. My coworker is nowhere to be seen, but before I can investigate something else took my attention.

When I return, again, my coworker explains to me what exactly shouldn't be done at the desk but was done anyway on a snap decision. My coworker had helped a guest check in, but the guest did not have a valid card for her weeklong stay. The CC declined, over and over again, but the guest insisted money was and would be on it. So barring all reason, my coworker handed her keys. 

I had asked her why she handed keys to a guest when the card declined, and she said she felt bad for this lady. She was homeless and was special needs. Her taxi was already gone, it was late at night, and she had nowhere to go. When I asked further, she explained what had happened while I was away from the desk.

My coworker saw this guest, roughly 40 years old and in a walker. She felt bad seeing her, gave her keys, and helped this lady to our handicapped room. She did mention that the guest began to strip- and I mean, buck ass naked strip - while my coworker was in the room helping the lady unload. The lady was constantly asking for my coworker to help her, and by seeing Unfiltered Ass, my coworker quickly nope'd out of there and left the lady alone and established boundaries, that we are not full-service, and she is not comfortable assisting further. 

My coworker told me that I can deal with her in the morning, because after this 3-11 shift I had the next morning, 7 to 3.

*Cereal chewing noises* Thanks. 

Next morning rolls around, and lo and behold, this lady's card is still declining and declined during the audit. I make a note to call the guest break and get this sorted out.

I called the room at 9am sharp, and the lady did not answer the phone. I bring the maintenance guy with me to knock on her door. She shouts something illegibly, as if she was woken up. I tell her that we need to see her at the desk. She ignores us. I knock again. Insistently, I repeat that she needs to come to the desk. After ignoring us, again, I made a decision based in inexperience. I attempted to open the door myself. However, the security latch was in place. With a half parted door I tell her that we need to discuss her method of payment at the desk. 

No response at all, and I give up. I went back to the desk, and cancelled the rest of her week. 

Our breakfast closes at 10am, and right before the doors close, this lady is hobbling and shifting in her walker down the hall. She ignores the desk entirely and goes for breakfast. Guests are side-eyeing her as she stuffs yogurts, breads, bagels, and oatmeal down her filthy shirt. She grabs as many condiments as she can fit in her clothes.

While she was helping herself, the maintenance guy beelined to her room and blocked her card reader's code, so her keys wouldn't be valid anymore. We do this sometimes when a guest's card is declining or if luggage is left behind in a due-out room past checkout. This is done to force an encounter with the desk when necessary.

He locked the door successfully, so all we had to do was wait. She ignored us, again, to hobble back to her room, but was stopped by her own door. So I wait for her to hobble to the front desk. All the while I can smell her odor from down the call.

She appeared far, far worse than I ever imagined. I make no exaggeration when I say her pants and underwear sagged to the floor. Her shirt had not been washed in a long time, her hair was a greasy mop, Her covid mask was stained with snot and grime and hadn't been changed in weeks, possibly months. She was obese, had a bum ankle, and had difficulty breathing properly. Her vision was terrible and she groaned to speak. 

And worst of all, her B.O. was reeking of a sickly sweet plague that could be smelled rooms away. I was nauseous the entire morning and lost my appetite. The front desk is on the opposite side of the lobby, and breakfast is beyond the lobby. We could smell her from the breakfast area.

She finally makes it to the desk, asking for her keys to be remade. I tell her, before I can remake her keys, we need to discuss the card she provided for the room. I tell her it declined and she needed to procure a valid method of payment to continue her stay here.

She goes livid very quickly. It had been years since this incident, so I don't have an accurate recounting of what all she said- but she argued that the card *did* have money, it had *hundreds* of dollars, the system is lying, and I was being mean for no reason. 

I calmly tell her, again, that the card she provided was not good last night. It did not even authorize for one night. She argued that my coworker said it was all taken care of! Why are you lying to me? Just give me my card and leave me alone! Made a big scene, guests heads were turning again.

I tell her that if she cannot produce a valid method of payment, she has until checkout time to vacate the room. The rest of her stay will be cancelled. She argued that no one was going to get into her room, and tried to walk away. I tell her that if she does not vacate the room, the police will trespass her. She whines and begs me to not call the police, again and again. But she still has money on her card, she's minding her own business, and I'm ruining her morning.

Pinching my nose. The odor is suddenly stronger. I remade her key to allow her to collect her belongings, but she insists that I need to help load all of her garbage bags. I tell her no. After hearing what happened last night the last time she had an employee in the room, I told her maintenance can drive the dolly for her but she is responsible for her own belongings.

She angrily wobbles away, huffing and puffing and making a big scene. I turn the corner and realize that she peed on the floor.

It takes her an hour to get her belongings out of the room, but now that she's checked out and in the lobby, we are now dealing with the fact that she has no transportation. She begs to use my cell phone, and I tell her no. I let her use one of the desk phones, in which she proceeds to slobber all over while dialing crumpled numbers she pulled out of her bra. 

She has no luck and insists I call a taxi for her. Cue an hour of me phoning around town until someone with a large enough car is able to come by the hotel and arrange a route for her. 

While I'm wasting my time with this, I notice that she is seated by our coffee station. When she thought I wasn't not looking, she emptied half our container of half and half packets and drank... about a dozen of them. 

She peed in that chair, too.

She waits in the lobby for about 2 hours. I'm just trying to find oxygen over here.

The first taxi driver arrived, but the lady is too slow to reach the door to greet him. The taxi driver took off without her, so I had to call multiple times before someone finally came over. And when the driver arrived, lo and behold. Her card for her taxi declined.

So this taxi driver took off without her.

At this point I tell her that I can have the police take her to a shelter or a relative's, because she had been loitering for several hours now. She begs me again to not call the police. But I don't listen to her this time, I'm tired of her odor, her piss, and her trash bags and tired of the taxis refusing her.

The police comes by shortly after, and help find transportation. They offer her a lift, so I was glad to finally see her gone. I could only hope she went somewhere to find help.

It takes an hour for the lobby to finally air out and I thoroughly sanitized everything she touched. I was still feeling the nausea that night.

Later, the head housekeeper storms up to me. I greatly respect this woman, but she can be *terrifying* when crossed. 

She told me to put that lady on the DNR, because she peed the bed and soaked the mattress.

Cue two months later. I see a reservation pop up- its the same lady. Somehow she booked a 7 day stay. Remembering last time, I cancelled it the moment I saw her come through the doors. 

She approaches me again. She remembered me from last time, and tries to present a card again. I run through the motions, and what do you know. Her card declined again.

I told her that her method of payment was no good, and on top of that, she had been blacklisted from the property and is no longer welcome here. 

She pretty much snaps at me, demanding I show her where it's declining. Caught up in the moment, I turn my screen around and show her where the red 'declined' message is. But I quickly realizes my mistake when she grabs the monitor and rubs her face- same greasy covid mask from last time- on the screen and demands to get a good look at it. I take the monitor back and tell her I cannot rent to her anymore, and she needs to go or the police will trespass her. She demands what the reason was, and I tell it to her straight: if the head of housekeeping tells me to DNR someone, I listen.

She makes a big show of crying, then runs through the same motions of demanding I call an IHOP employee who gave her a ride- she insists it was a friend of hers. I tell her she has to use the phones on the wall this time. She doesn't even attempt to call them before she cries again, pulls my trainee aside to vent about how awful of a person I was for kicking her out for no reason, and how nobody in the world will help her. How her IHOP friend refused to helped her again.

I call non emergency again and tell them I have a non-guest who needs assistance leaving the hotel. The police show up again, and recognize her. One of them spoke with me and said they had seen her pretty much everywhere and gets kicked out for the same reasons. 

I'm assuming she peed in their cars last time, because they don't offer her transportation again. They have me phone in a taxi for her again, and when the driver arrives and her card declines for her ride 40 minutes out of town, I could see his soul leave his body when the police tell him that he has to take her because she is not welcome here. 

I question to this day if the police really should have forced the guy to take her out of town. And why not to a hospital? In hindsight she was clearly unwell and in need of help. He wasn't paid for it and probably got a soiled carseat just to dump her out of town.

As she's getting her belongings loaded, she tells me that I don't have to worry about ever seeing her again.

Oh, and she peed in the lobby again.

Hinata struggled to blend in brazil, lost his wallet (that was so sad), needed some friend's company. So I felt like only someone like oikawa, with his silly personality could cheer him up. I'm glad they met in the end. Oikawa paid for lunch, tried to show off by doing a serve which failed miserably in the beach (he's so silly haha), funny and light-hearted trash talk with his friends, and adapted well in the 2 on 2 with Hinata. Honestly, I think there couldn't be a better person hinata met on that day.

And I'm sure Oikawa also felt good about meeting Hinata. The admiration that Hinata had for Oikawa is soo good, so I'm sure it lifted up Oikawa too.. (I mean, who doesn't like the sunshine boy haha). And while leaving, he called him ""Shoyo"" and hinata teared up 🥹

My name is Mike. And this story changed me forever.

Chapter 1. An Ordinary Evening  
I had been dating Emily for almost four years. Everyone said we were the perfect couple. I believed she was ""the one."" We made plans, talked about the future, laughed, fought, made up… Everything felt so real.

I wouldn't say everything was perfect. We argued from time to time, but who doesn't? Sometimes, I felt like she was a bit distant, but I attributed it to stress, work, or her personal struggles.

That evening, I was at home, sitting on the couch and scrolling through my phone. Emily had said she was meeting her friends and would be back late. I was calm because I trusted her.

But as soon as she left, I felt a strange unease that I couldn’t understand. A gnawing emptiness. I pushed it away, but the anxiety lingered.

Then the phone rang.

Chapter 2. The Call That Changed Everything  
— Mike, where are you right now?

It was Jake, my friend. I could hear the tension in his voice.

— At home. Why?

— Listen... Maybe I'm overreacting, but... I just saw Emily.

— So what? She's not under house arrest.

— Yeah, but... she was with some guy.

I chuckled.

— Could be anyone.

— Yeah, but he had his arm around her waist, and they went into a hotel.

Silence. I felt something cold tightening around my throat.

— What?..

— Yeah, I was shocked too, but it was like ten minutes ago. I thought I was imagining things, but... damn, man, it looked really strange.

I was silent, trying to figure out how to respond.

— Maybe you were mistaken?

— Mike, I was five meters away from them. That was Emily.

I took a deep breath. I was sure this was some kind of nightmare, a dream, and I would wake up any moment.

— What hotel?

He gave me the address.

— Alright, I'll call you back.

I hung up and stared at the wall.

What am I doing? This is insane. She wouldn't do that. It's just a ridiculous coincidence. Maybe it’s a business meeting? Maybe he’s a friend?

But five minutes later, I was already sitting in the car, gripping the wheel, trying not to let my thoughts run wild.

Chapter 3. Waiting at the Hotel  
I stood across from the hotel, feeling myself shaking. Every moment felt endless.

Time dragged on until finally, the doors opened.

Emily.

She was fixing her hair, her face lit up with a slight smile.

And right behind her came a tall, well-dressed man. He said something, and she laughed. She laughed in a way she hadn’t laughed with me in a long time.

I watched them say goodbye. He leaned in, whispered something, and she nodded, smiling.

In that moment, I realized it wasn’t a mistake. It wasn’t a coincidence. It was the end.

Chapter 4. The Conversation  
I waited until she walked away from the hotel, then I called her.

— Hi, — her voice sounded cheerful, as if nothing had happened.

— Where are you?

— With the girls.

My heart raced. I didn’t know what to say. I wanted to ask why she was lying, but I just couldn’t.

— Are you sure?

— Yeah, why?

I paused, trying to swallow the lump in my throat.

— Turn around.

Three seconds passed. Then she slowly turned around and saw me. Her face at that moment... I’ll never forget it.

— Mike… I... What are you doing here?

I took a step closer.

— Good question, Emily. Come on, answer me.

She swallowed, quickly stuffed her phone into her pocket.

— It's not what you think...

— Not what I think? — I clenched my fists. — Then explain.

She froze, avoiding my gaze.

— He's just a friend.

— A friend? — I nodded toward the hotel. — Do you often walk through hotels with ""friends""?

She was silent. I could see her face change as she tried to find an excuse.

— Mike… I…

— You’re lying to my face.

She stepped toward me, but I backed away.

— Mike, please, let’s talk.

I looked at her, and at that moment, she wasn’t the person I knew and loved. The person standing in front of me was someone else, a stranger.

— There’s nothing to talk about, Emily.

I turned and walked away.

She called after me, but I didn’t hear her. My steps were quick, almost running. I didn’t know how not to tear myself apart, but I had to leave.

Chapter 5. The Aftermath  
At home, I sat in silence for a long time.

Emily sent me hundreds of messages, called, but I didn’t respond. Every call, every message tore me apart. I felt something inside me tighten and not let go.

The next day, I packed her things and left them by the door.

When she came, I stood with my arms crossed.

— Mike, you really don’t want to talk?

— You made your choice. Now I’ll make mine.

She cried, but I didn’t care anymore. I couldn’t feel compassion. I needed to survive, not regret.

When the door closed behind her, I realized one thing.

I lost her.

But the worst part…

I didn’t lose her.

I lost myself.

Chapter 6. A New Beginning  
After what happened with Emily, it took me a long time to pull myself together. I couldn’t understand how she could do this. All the feelings I had for her were shattered like a sandcastle. It felt like even thinking about her caused cold and pain inside.

I replayed all the moments we spent together, and now they all seemed like lies. I felt betrayed, abandoned, and honestly, empty.

But with each day, the pain became a little more bearable. Over time, I realized that life doesn’t end with a breakup. I didn’t know how it would look, but I knew I had to move forward. I started spending more time with friends, going out more, exercising, and finding the strength to smile.

Over time, I began to feel a little better. The sadness didn’t disappear, but I learned to live with it. And one day, I realized that maybe I could be happy again.

Chapter 7. The Meeting  
I was sitting in a café, enjoying my coffee, when they walked in. I immediately recognized Emily. She was walking next to him — the same guy. Alex. My chest tightened, and I felt a cold shiver down my spine.

Emily noticed me first. She flinched slightly when she saw me, and her face went pale.

I stood up and walked to their table.

— Hey, — I said, trying to speak calmly, but the tension inside me was overwhelming.

— Mike… Hey, — her voice was tense, and she was clearly trying to control herself.

— How’s it going? — I asked, again trying to remain as neutral as possible.

— Everything’s fine, — she answered with a slight awkwardness. — This… This is my boyfriend, Alex.

I looked at him. Alex met my gaze with a genuinely friendly smile, as if nothing had happened.

— Nice to meet you, — I said, extending my hand, but deep inside, everything felt different.

— Likewise, — he replied, slightly surprised, but also trying to be polite.

We talked for a few minutes about how the past weeks had gone, how each of us was doing. Emily apologized for everything that happened, but I told her I didn’t hold any grudges. I didn’t know what else to say, and honestly, I didn’t want to dive deeper into the topic.

We said our goodbyes and went our separate ways. That was the end of our conversation.

Chapter 8. The Truth  
Later, I learned that Alex was an old friend of Emily’s. They had known each other for many years. All this time, he had been supporting her, hoping for a chance, and I hadn’t even suspected it.

I don’t blame her for giving in. I blame her for not telling me. She didn’t confess her doubts and feelings. But all of this is a lesson for me. For both of us.

Chapter 9. Forgiveness  
I thought a lot about whether to forgive Emily. It was hard to accept the fact that all our shared moments now seemed empty. But over time, I realized she wasn’t entirely happy either. She made a mistake, but I could see that she was hurting too.

I forgave her, not because I forgot everything, but because I understood — if I didn’t forgive, I would stay stuck in the past. And I wouldn’t be able to move forward.

Forgiveness is not weakness. It’s a way to free yourself from the past and give yourself a chance at the present.

Chapter 10. New Love  
Then I met Sarah. She wasn’t like Emily. We didn’t start with promises or pretty words. We just spent time together. It was simpler than I expected.

Sarah didn’t demand that I forget the past. She was just there, helping me become better and believe in myself.

Maybe we haven’t found all the answers yet. But maybe, now, I’m ready for the next step.

And maybe one day, Emily and I will meet again. But with different eyes.

And I will be ready to forgive.",8,1739875399.0,cheating_stories,6,0.79,False
1is9vkb,https://youtu.be/8ZaoLdN3fdI?si=PTVSOAQNuyw9zQfU,Taking NAC can be GREAT if you have OCD!!!,"
Summary of video -

NAC (N-Acetylcysteine) is presented as your brain’s secret weapon against OCD and harmful habits. This video outlines personal experiences with NAC, emphasizing its significant impact on reducing obsessive thoughts, improving mental clarity, and aiding in addiction recovery. The central theme revolves around the multiple health benefits of NAC, including its ability to enhance lung function and assist in detoxifying without severe side effects. Viewers can gain insights into how NAC balances neurotransmitters, thereby promoting overall mental health and well-being. Discover how to potentially elevate your emotional and physical health through this powerful supplement!

1. 🧠 NAC: Benefits for OCD and Mental Clarity
NAC effectively treats OCD by reducing obsessive thoughts and behaviors. 
It helps diminish cravings for drugs and aids in treating addiction and bad habits. 
Using NAC promotes a more organized mental state, allowing for clearer and more rational thinking. 
The body produces limited NAC; supplementation is necessary for optimal benefits. 

2. 🧠 The Role of NAC in Brain Function
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an amino acid that regulates glutamate levels, the primary neurotransmitter in the brain. 
Glutamate transmits signals between neurons, crucial for memory formation. 
NAC influences dopamine release, maintaining healthy receptors for motivation, energy, pleasure, and focus. 
It balances the brain's inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters, helping to reduce stress and anxiety. 

3. 🧠 The Role of NAC in Treating OCD and Addiction
Research indicates that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) can significantly aid in treating moderate to severe cases of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). 
Increasing NAC intake is associated with fewer intrusive or compulsive thoughts. 
NAC stabilizes impulses, making individuals less likely to engage in drug addiction or bad habits. 
Preliminary studies reveal that NAC can reduce cravings for marijuana and nicotine, supporting its effectiveness. 
It also mitigates withdrawal symptoms related to cocaine addiction and reduces the risk of relapse. 
Many substance abuse issues arise from obsessive and compulsive desires, highlighting NAC's potential in treatment. 

4. 🌬️ Benefits of NAC for Lung Health and Detoxification
NAC helps loosen excess mucus in the lungs, making it easier to breathe and reducing coughing. 
It is especially beneficial for respiratory issues such as colds, bronchitis, or asthma. 
Users report feeling less irritable and more composed after taking NAC. 
NAC has notably improved lung health, particularly for users with a history of smoking. 
Initial usage may cause increased coughing as NAC helps clear out impurities, leading to greater lung cleanliness over time. 
Additionally, NAC aids in detoxifying the kidneys and liver, and is used in hospitals for Tylenol overdose treatment. 

5. 🧠 NAC as a Supplement for Health Benefits
The normal recommended dose of NAC is 600 to 1200 mg daily, with clinical trials indicating that doses up to 2,000 mg are safe and effective. 
NAC can help reduce hangovers effectively, particularly when taken as 1200 mg before and after consuming alcohol. 
One potential side effect of NAC is the enhancement of histamine release, which may increase allergic reactions. 
Anhedonia, the inability to experience not as much pleasure while doing pleasurable activities, may occur if exceeding the recommended dose of NAC, although 600 mg is generally safe. 
NAC regulates dopamine levels, which can balance emotional responses, making highs less intense while reducing lows. 

5.1. Understanding NAC Dosage and Effects
The normal recommended dosage of NAC is between 600 to 1200 mg daily. 
Clinical trials indicate that doses up to 2,000 mg are both safe and effective. 
Taking 1200 mg of NAC before and after drinking alcohol may help reduce hangovers more effectively than other remedies. 
NAC can enhance the release of histamine, which may worsen allergic reactions. 
Anhedonia, the inability to feel pleasure, is a potential side effect of exceeding the recommended dosage. 
This anhedonia effect usually does not occur when staying within the 600 mg limit. 
5.2. The Impact of NAC on Dopamine Regulation
NAC controls how much dopamine is fired, affecting overall emotional experiences across different situations. 
It can lessen the enjoyment of high moments while reducing the intensity of low moments. 
Personal experience suggests NAC increases the highs even more than it diminishes the lows, resulting in more dopamine flowing. 
5.3. Benefits and Effects of NAC
NAC may slightly reduce the effectiveness of other drugs by limiting dopamine release, thus decreasing neurotoxicity. 
For instance, the effect of three cups of coffee may feel like two, providing smoother stimulation and less of a crash. 
In summary, NAC is a remarkable supplement with numerous health benefits, helpful for purifying the mind, counteracting hangovers, and eliminating bad habits.

I am running the most influential high school biology club in Egypt, STEM October Biology Club. 

The club has allowed my school’s sophomores to delve into college-level biology curriculum, do research, and participate in hands-on workshops. We even started a Medium account and will publish our members simplified science articles soon.

Additionally, we have been organizing the International BioLeague Competition since 2021, and participants were from 75+ countries last year.

Next month, we wanted to provide our members with a hands-on workshop in a leading Egyptian biotechnology lab, in which they will try DNA extraction, electrophoresis, and PCR.

As a non-profit, however, the club’s financial income is limited. The workshop costs only 50$, but in Egyptian currency, it is a lot for middle-class high schoolers.

We want to achieve the 50$ by March 1st so that we can pay the deposit needed by the lab. Any dollar will be significant in our academic journey, and please share when possible.

Whether you’re looking to indulge in a classic childhood favorite or discover a new go-to treat, these Canadian sweets deserve a spot in your shopping cart. Let’s explore the top 10 must-try [**Canadian candies**](https://candyville.ca/) that make the country a haven for candy lovers!

https://preview.redd.it/nuvp2y5njvje1.png?width=2240&format=png&auto=webp&s=40b3f3d5eedc952cc091e402f4e2881198dec95f

**1. Coffee Crisp:** A truly Canadian delight, Coffee Crisp is a chocolate bar with layers of vanilla wafer and a subtle coffee-flavored cream filling. It’s the perfect combination of crunch and sweetness, making it a favorite among chocolate lovers. Whether you enjoy it with your morning coffee or as an afternoon pick-me-up, Coffee Crisp is a treat worth savoring.

**2. Smarties (Canadian Version):** Not to be confused with the U.S. version of Smarties (which are actually tart candies), Canadian Smarties are colorful candy-coated chocolates similar to M&Ms but with a richer, creamier taste. They melt in your mouth, not in your hand, and have been a staple in Canadian candy stores for generations.

**3. Crispy Crunch:** If you love peanut butter and chocolate, then Crispy Crunch is a must-try. This iconic candy bar features a flaky peanut butter filling wrapped in a thick layer of milk chocolate. Its satisfying crunch and bold peanut butter flavor make it an all-time favorite among Canadians.

**4. Big Turk:** A unique offering in the world of chocolate bars, Big Turk is a delightful mix of chewy Turkish delight covered in a layer of milk chocolate. Unlike traditional caramel- or nougat-filled chocolates, this one provides a distinct taste and texture that sets it apart.

**5. Caramilk:** The mystery of “how they get the caramel inside the Caramilk bar” has intrigued Canadians for years. This smooth and creamy milk chocolate bar has a luscious, flowing caramel center that makes every bite an indulgent experience. It’s a go-to choice for anyone who loves the perfect blend of chocolate and caramel.

**6. Wunderbar:** Peanut butter lovers, this one’s for you! Wunderbar is a deliciously messy mix of caramel, peanut butter, and crispy rice, all coated in a rich layer of milk chocolate. It’s the perfect balance of sweet and salty, with a gooey, crunchy texture that keeps you coming back for more.

**7. Eat-More:** Unlike your typical candy bar, Eat-More is a chewy, sticky treat made with dark toffee, peanuts, and chocolate. Its unique texture and rich nutty flavor make it stand out from other confections. If you enjoy old-fashioned candies with a satisfying chew, this is one to add to your list.

**8. Cherry Blossom:** Cherry Blossom is a candy that surprises you with every bite. It consists of a whole cherry soaked in syrup, surrounded by a creamy cherry-flavored filling and coated in chocolate and coconut. It’s a vintage candy that has been enjoyed by Canadians for decades and continues to hold a special place in their hearts.

**9. Maynards Wine Gums:** For those who prefer chewy, fruity candies, Maynards Wine Gums are a must-try. These chewy, flavorful gummies come in a variety of fruit flavors and have a unique texture that’s firmer than regular gummy candies. Despite their name, they contain no alcohol—just pure, fruity goodness.

**10. Mackintosh’s Toffee:** If you love classic, old-fashioned toffee, Mackintosh’s Toffee is the perfect treat. It’s a firm, creamy, and chewy toffee that softens in your mouth over time, making it a slow, enjoyable candy experience. Many Canadians grew up breaking this toffee into smaller pieces and savoring each bite.

1is9n2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1is9n2k/day_6_and_7_ha_giang_loop_day_4_cat_ba_island/,Day 6 and 7: Ha Giang Loop Day 4 → Cat Ba Island,"In the morning, after a homely breakfast at the guesthouse, the group walked on over to the Du Gia Waterfall, where you can relax and swim in the natural pools. The oasis is hidden within rugged and lush landscapes. The group spent a relaxing couple hours swimming, picnicking and jumping into the natural pools. It’s certainly a great way to end the Ha Giang Loop tour before making our drive back to Ha Giang city. This stop was much appreciated after 4 days on the back of the motorbike, as we got another chance to unwind and loosen the legs from all the sitting.



As we rode back to Ha Giang city, the group enjoyed one last chance to relish the beauty of the rugged landscapes. Once back, we were able to explore the city a bit on the motorbikes. We stopped and got some bun cha (grilled meat served with noodles, veggie alongside a big bowl of sweet tangy sauce) and a cup of Ha Giang roasted ca phe sua da (iced coffee with milk) before heading back to the hotel to freshen up.



We now have a long journey ahead of us. At 7 PM, the group boards a VIP sleeper bus to Hai Phong city before hopping on a ferry to Cat Ba Island. The total journey time will be 12 hours including the ferry and a shorter bus ride. I’ve never sat on a bus so long before so this will be a first. Thankfully I’ll be asleep for a majority of the time. 



In the morning, we woke up to take a short ferry to Cat Ba Island, followed by a short bus ride to Cat Ba town. Cat Ba town is an underdeveloped resort town on Cat Ba Island. There’s not much going on here, which is my type of place to travel. A far cry from the one year I visited Nha Trang. A touristic city that comes off as a playground for thousands of Russians looking to escape the cold every year. Here you’ll find waterfront restaurants and cafes with several hotels lining the strip.



Cat Ba Island itself houses Cat Ba National Park and is the perfect backdrop for adventurers and nature enthusiasts to explore. Exploring the island will yield you limestone hills, lush vegetation and pristine beaches. Along the hiking trail, there were numerous viewpoints to stop at for rest and to relish the natural sceneries. However, our real destination was summiting Ngu Lam Peak, the highest point in Cat Ba island which provides panoramic views of the island and the surrounding area. Be careful hiking here, as the path goes from paved to eventually rocky and steep. It was only a short hike of around 45 minutes each way. During the trek through the park, we were lucky to catch some cool wildlife including various birds and (with our guides binoculars) the ever elusive Cat Ba Langur, an endangered primate species with beautiful golden fur.



In the afternoon we visited Cannon Fort for an excursion into the military history of the island. We saw remnants of war bunkers and tunnels set to the backdrop of stunning bay views. We then went to Hospital Cave, a hideaway in a mountain set up by the Chinese and Vietnamese to protect the Viet Cong and injured from American bombing during the war. All in all, it was a fun and informative trip before making our way to Cat Co 2 beach to enjoy the alluring tropical sunset.



When we returned to Cat Ba town, the group unwinded at Cat Ba Oasis Bar for a night of food and drinks before heading to the night market for an evening stroll. All in all, it was a fun, easygoing day. Tomorrow we head out to sea at Lan Ha Bay for a nice change of scenery.

The almond espresso (the last one I bought) was definitely oat latte and then the one before was straight up chocolate milk.

1is9m9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1is9m9k/curious/,Curious,"Hello Coffee people. Pretty new to coffee here, After Lurking around the Subreddit, I finally decided to ask some questions i had about coffee that I was wondering about since I got into specialty coffee.
Here they are-

1. How do you guys even come to know about they different specialty Coffee roasters in india? How do you Like ""Browse through roasters""?

2. Is there a French Press available in india, which I can also use as a Milk Pitcher for Latte Art? I don't know why I just don't want to buy just a pitcher, atleast just yet.

3. Right now I usually either use the channi method or instant coffee. I was wondering should I get a SIF or Channi method is better? The reason I am considering a SIF, Is right now I don't really have a brewer, and I also like to think Coffee as a journey, so I want to Start at ground zero. Then I am considering to Try out other brewers as well like Aeropress and Moka Pot (Not V60, I don't drink coffee Black, only with milk).

Thank You.",2,1739874185.0,IndiaCoffee,3,1.0,False
