Thought I’d shoot my shot and see if there’s anyone here who’d be down for something simple but special planespotting. Yep, I’m one of those people who can quietly watch planes take off and land for hours, imagining where they’re coming from, where they’re headed, and all the stories in between. 

I usually go somewhere near the airport, find a nice spot, and just vibe with the sound of jet engines and golden hour skies. If you’ve never tried it before, I swear it’s more calming than it sounds and ten times better with company.

A little about me: I’m a 20s something tech guy, neat freak (but chill, promise), into aviation, coffee, music, and spontaneous late-night drives. I’m that kind of guy who’ll bring your favorite drink without asking and send you random trivia about the plane we’re watching. 😅

I can pick you up (as long as you’re not too far — sorry Baguio girls), and we can grab coffee before or after. No pressure, no expectations. Just good conversation, city lights, and a shared curiosity for the skies.

If this sounds like your kind of quiet adventure, feel free to DM me. Let’s make the runway our backdrop.

1kok73s,https://youtu.be/zEIois0KJN8,3 Very Scary TRUE Disturbing Camping In Alaska Horror Stories,"**""The Nighttime Visitor: A Chilling Alaska Camping Encounter."":**

I was camping with my friend Alex in the Chugach mountains, about 40 minutes from Anchorage. We’d driven down a rough dirt road for 20 minutes to reach a public use area by a river, a spot we’d heard about from a coworker. It was far enough from the highway to feel like the middle of nowhere, just the way we liked it. The river gurgled nearby, and the trees stood tall and thick, blocking out most of the world. No other campers were around, which made it feel like we owned the place. We spent the afternoon setting up our tent, a sturdy green dome we’d used for years, and gathering wood for a campfire. By evening, we were sprawled out on folding chairs, roasting hot dogs on sticks and sipping cheap beer from a cooler. The fire crackled, and we laughed about old high school stories, the kind that get funnier every time you tell them.As the sky darkened, the stars came out, sharp and bright. We were in no rush to sleep, so we kept the fire going, adding logs and poking at the embers. Around 10:30 PM, we were deep into a conversation about Alex’s dog, a hyper mutt that once stole a whole pizza off his counter. Mid-laugh, we heard it—a car engine, low and rumbling, cutting through the quiet. It wasn’t loud at first, but it was steady, like someone was driving slow, maybe looking for something. We both froze, our laughter dying out. I looked at Alex, his face lit by the fire’s glow. “That’s odd,” I said, keeping my voice light. “Who’s coming out here this late?”The sound got closer, and headlights flickered through the trees, bouncing along the dirt road. The car was moving at a crawl, way slower than anyone would drive to just pass through. Alex set his beer down and leaned forward. “Maybe it’s a ranger or something,” he said, but he didn’t sound convinced. The headlights grew brighter, and soon a big SUV rolled into the campground, its dark paint gleaming in the firelight. The windows were tinted so black I couldn’t see inside, even with the glow from our fire. The SUV stopped about 30 feet from our tent, its engine idling and headlights pointed straight at us, blindingly bright. It didn’t move, didn’t turn off, just sat there like it was watching.I shifted in my chair, my skin prickling. “This is weird,” I said under my breath. Alex nodded, his eyes locked on the car. “What are they doing? Just sitting there?” he whispered. We waited, expecting someone to get out, maybe ask for directions or say they were camping nearby. But nothing happened. The engine kept purring, and those headlights stayed on, pinning us in their glare. My mouth felt dry, and my heart started to thud. I tried to think of a reason for this—maybe they were lost, or their car broke down—but none of it felt right.After a couple of minutes, I couldn’t take it anymore. I stood up, brushing my hands on my jeans, and grabbed my flashlight from the cooler. “I’m gonna check it out,” I said, trying to sound braver than I felt. Alex grabbed my arm. “Don’t,” he said, his voice sharp. “What if they’re… I don’t know, trouble?” I hesitated, but the silence from the car was driving me crazy. “I’ll just ask if they’re okay,” I said. “Stay here.”I walked a few steps toward the SUV, my boots crunching on the gravel. The air felt heavy, like the night was holding its breath. I raised my flashlight, though it was useless against those headlights, and called out, “Hey! You guys alright over there?” My voice echoed a little, but it sounded small, swallowed by the dark. No answer. No movement. Just that engine, steady and low, and the lights burning into me. I took another step, squinting to see anything through the windshield, but it was like staring into a void. “Hello?” I tried again, louder. Nothing.I turned back to Alex, who was standing now, clutching a stick he’d pulled from the fire. His face was pale, his eyes wide. “This isn’t right,” he said, barely loud enough for me to hear. I nodded, my stomach twisting. “Let’s just wait,” I said, walking back to the fire. “Maybe they’ll leave.” We sat down, but neither of us relaxed. We kept our eyes on the SUV, our voices low. “Could be hunters,” I said, grasping for something normal. “Or campers looking for a spot.” Alex shook his head. “Hunters don’t drive like that. And who camps at this hour without saying anything?”After what felt like forever but was probably only three or four minutes, the SUV’s engine revved, sharp and sudden. I flinched, and Alex grabbed his chair’s armrests. The car started moving, slow at first, creeping along the edge of the campground like it was circling us. Then it turned and drove back down the dirt road, its taillights glowing red before disappearing into the trees. The silence rushed back, but it didn’t feel safe anymore. I let out a shaky breath. “Okay, that was creepy,” I said, forcing a laugh. Alex didn’t smile. “Creepy’s an understatement,” he muttered, tossing his stick into the fire.We tried to go back to talking, but it was forced, our words clipped. I kept glancing at the road, half-expecting those headlights to reappear. Alex did the same, his foot tapping nervously. We decided to put out the fire, thinking maybe the light was drawing attention. We poured water over the logs, the hiss and steam filling the air. The darkness closed in tighter without the fire, and I wished we’d left it burning.About an hour later, maybe midnight, we heard it again. That same low rumble, the same slow approach. My heart sank. “No way,” I whispered. Alex sat up straight, his hands clenched. “It’s them,” he said, his voice tight. The headlights came back, cutting through the trees, and the SUV rolled into the campground again. This time, it stopped closer, maybe 15 feet from our tent, so close I could hear the faint hum of its engine over the river. The headlights were aimed right at us, brighter than before, like they wanted us to feel exposed.I grabbed my flashlight, my hands shaking now. “Stay here,” I told Alex, but he was already up, holding another stick, this one thicker. “No chance,” he said. “We’re in this together.” I nodded, grateful but terrified. I stepped toward the car, shining my light at it, though it did nothing against those beams. “Hey!” I shouted, my voice cracking. “What do you want? Say something!” Silence. The car just sat there, unmoving, its dark windows hiding whoever was inside. I felt like a bug under a magnifying glass, pinned and helpless.Then we heard it—a car door opening, soft but unmistakable. Gravel crunched under footsteps, slow and deliberate, coming from the driver’s side. My flashlight beam caught a shadow, tall and thin, moving just out of sight around the car. My breath caught in my throat. “Did you see that?” I hissed to Alex. He nodded, his grip tightening on the stick. “Yeah,” he said, his voice barely a whisper. “There’s someone out there.”The footsteps stopped, and for a moment, everything was still. Then they started again, closer, circling toward the edge of the campground. I swung my flashlight, but the beam didn’t catch anything, just trees and shadows. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst. “Alex,” I said, backing toward the tent. “We need to get out of here. Now.” He didn’t argue. “Agreed,” he said. “Let’s move.”We bolted for the tent, grabbing our bags and sleeping pads, not caring if we left stuff behind. My hands fumbled with the zippers, and I kept glancing at the SUV, expecting that shadow to step into the light. The car hadn’t moved, but those headlights felt alive, watching every move we made. As we stuffed our gear into our backpacks, I heard more footsteps, closer now, near the trees behind our tent. A twig snapped, loud in the quiet, and I froze. “You hear that?” I whispered. Alex nodded, his face ghost-white. “They’re out there,” he said. “We gotta go.”We threw our bags into the back of my truck, an old pickup parked 10 feet from the tent. I grabbed the keys from my pocket, my fingers so shaky I nearly dropped them. “Come on, come on,” I muttered, climbing into the driver’s seat. Alex jumped in beside me, slamming his door and locking it. I turned the key, and the engine roared to life, louder than I remembered. I hit the gas, spinning the tires on the gravel as we peeled out of the campground. In the rearview mirror, I saw the SUV’s headlights shift, like it was turning to follow. My stomach lurched. “They’re moving,” I said, my voice high. Alex twisted in his seat, staring back. “Just keep going,” he said. “Don’t stop.”The dirt road was narrow, full of ruts and rocks, and I gripped the wheel tight, trying not to fishtail. The SUV’s lights stayed behind us for a minute, faint but there, before they vanished. I didn’t know if they’d stopped or turned off the road, and I didn’t care. I just wanted distance between us and them. We didn’t talk much on the drive back to Anchorage, an hour that felt like forever. Alex kept his hand on the door handle, his eyes darting to the side mirrors. I kept mine on the road, my knuckles white. “What was that?” Alex finally said, his voice low. “Who just… does that?” I shook my head, my throat tight. “I don’t know. I don’t want to know.”We rolled into Anchorage around 2:30 AM, the city lights a relief after the dark. We found a motel off the highway, a cheap place with flickering neon signs, and checked in without saying much. Our room smelled like old carpet, but it felt safe. We dropped our bags and sat on the lumpy beds, staring at the floor. “I keep thinking they’re gonna pull up outside,” Alex said, rubbing his face. I nodded, feeling the same. “Yeah. Me too.”We didn’t sleep much that night, just lay there, jumping at every car that passed on the highway. The next day, we drove home, still quiet, still shaken. That trip changed things. I used to love remote camping, the kind where you don’t see another soul. Now, I stick to busy campgrounds, ones with RVs and families and noise. I carry a knife in my pack, too, tucked in a side pocket where I can grab it fast. Alex quit camping altogether. He says he can’t shake the feeling of being watched, like those headlights are still out there, waiting. I don’t blame him. Sometimes, when I’m alone at night, I hear that engine in my head, slow and steady, and I see that shadow moving just out of sight. I don’t know who was in that SUV or what they wanted, and I hope I never find out.





**""Hunted by the Grizzly: My Nightmare in Alaska"":**

I’d always been pulled to the wild, to places where the world felt raw and untouched. Alaska was the ultimate test, a land of endless forests and rivers that could make you feel like you were the only soul alive. In July 2021, I found myself at a remote mining camp, about 40 miles outside Nome, tucked in a narrow river valley. The camp was nothing fancy—a small wooden shack with a creaky bed, a rusty stove, a table, and a shelf for supplies. A bucket in the corner served as a makeshift bathroom. Outside, the river ran shallow and clear, perfect for panning gold. That was my plan: strike it rich, or at least find enough to make the trip worth it. I was alone, no cellphone signal for miles, just a satellite phone I kept on the shack’s table, thinking I wouldn’t need it. The nearest road was a day’s hike, and I liked it that way. Or so I thought.The first few days were peaceful. I’d wake early, brew coffee on the stove, and head to the river with my pan and shovel. The work was slow—kneeling in the gravel, swirling water, checking for flecks of gold that rarely appeared. My hands got raw, my back ached, but the quiet kept me going. At night, I’d build a small campfire, the flames crackling as I ate canned beans or jerky, staring at the stars. It felt like freedom, like I’d escaped the noise of the world. But on the third night, that freedom turned into something else.I was sitting by the fire, poking at the embers with a stick, when a rustling came from the bushes across the river. It was faint at first, like a breeze moving branches. I ignored it, figuring it was a squirrel or maybe a fox. Then came a heavier sound—twigs snapping, followed by a low, guttural huff. My skin prickled. I grabbed my flashlight from the ground and clicked it on, sweeping the beam across the darkness. Two glowing eyes stared back, catching the light like mirrors. It was a grizzly bear, massive, its dark fur blending into the shadows, its head low and swaying. It stood maybe 30 feet away, just beyond the river’s edge.I’d heard plenty about grizzlies before coming here. Locals in Nome had warned me they were common in these parts, unpredictable, especially if they were hungry or felt cornered. My heart hammered, but I forced myself to stay calm. I stood up slowly, keeping the fire between us, and spread my arms to look bigger. “Hey, bear,” I said, my voice louder than I felt. “I’m not trouble. Just go on, okay?”The bear didn’t move at first. It snorted, its breath steaming in the cool air, and took a slow step forward, its paws sinking into the soft ground. I could see its muscles ripple under its fur, the sheer size of it making my stomach twist. I backed up, one careful step at a time, toward the shack, never turning away. “Easy, bear,” I said again, softer now. “I don’t want your space.” After what felt like an hour but was probably a minute, it huffed again, turned, and lumbered into the darkness. The rustling faded, but my hands were still shaking when I reached the shack.I didn’t sleep much that night. I dragged my sleeping bag inside, pushed the table and a heavy crate against the door, and sat on the bed with my rifle across my lap. Every creak of the shack, every snap outside, made me jump. Morning came slow, and when I stepped outside, I found fresh tracks—big, deep paw prints circling the camp, some right up to the shack’s walls. The bear had been sniffing around while I was inside. I checked my food, stored in a metal container hung from a tree branch 50 yards away, and it was untouched. I tightened the rope anyway, then cleaned up the camp, making sure no scraps were left to draw it back. I kept my rifle slung over my shoulder all day, my eyes darting to the trees.I thought maybe I’d scared it off. Grizzlies don’t always stick around, or so I’d heard. But the next night, I woke to a loud crash. The shack door was shaking, the wood groaning as something heavy slammed against it. I scrambled for my flashlight and rifle, my pulse racing. Through the small, cloudy window, I saw the bear’s massive head, its jaws open, teeth glinting as it pawed at the door. The crate I’d used as a barricade was sliding across the floor. I aimed my rifle at the ceiling and fired, the shot echoing like thunder in the tiny shack. The bear flinched, its growl cutting off, and it backed away. I heard its claws scrape the dirt as it circled the shack, sniffing, pacing, before finally moving off.I sat there till dawn, my back against the wall, rifle in my hands. The door was scratched, the frame splintered, but it held. I spent the morning nailing boards over the damage, my hands clumsy from lack of sleep. I moved my food container farther from camp, double-checking the knots. I even dragged some logs to pile around the shack, hoping it’d make the bear think twice. But it didn’t.The attacks kept coming. Every night, the bear was back, more aggressive each time. One night, it tore through my makeshift barricade like it was paper, ripping the door off its hinges. I fired another shot into the air, my ears ringing, and it retreated, but not far. I could hear it out there, growling low, waiting. I was down to six bullets now, and my food was dwindling—cans of soup, a few protein bars, not enough to last. I started rationing, eating half portions, my stomach growling as much as the bear.The worst night came a few days later. I was half-asleep, my body heavy with exhaustion, when the bear crashed through what was left of the door. Before I could grab my rifle, it was on me, its claws sinking into my leg. Pain exploded through me, sharp and hot, as it dragged me across the floor and out into the dirt. I screamed, kicking with my free leg, my hands scrabbling for anything to fight with. “Get off!” I yelled, my voice raw. I grabbed a broken board and swung it at the bear’s face, hitting its snout. It roared, loosening its grip just enough for me to twist free. I crawled back to the shack, blood pouring from my leg, my arms and ribs bruised from hitting the ground. The bear didn’t follow, but I heard it pacing nearby, its heavy breaths filling the night.I bandaged my leg with a torn shirt, but the cuts were deep, and I could barely stand. I was out of options. I had to get help, or I wouldn’t survive another attack. In the shack, I found a can of old red paint under the bed. Dragging myself onto the roof, every movement agony, I painted “SOS” and “HELP ME” in huge, sloppy letters. The effort left me dizzy, but I hoped a plane or helicopter might spot it. I crawled back inside, barricaded the door with the table and bed frame, and waited.The bear kept coming every night. I’d hear its claws on the shack, its growls closer each time. I was down to two bullets, my leg swelling, my body weak from hunger and pain. I stopped sleeping, just sat with my rifle, whispering to myself, “You’re gonna make it. Just hold on.” But I wasn’t sure I believed it. I started thinking about my family, wondering if they’d ever know what happened to me out here.Days blurred together. I lost track of time, my world shrinking to the shack and the bear’s nightly visits. Then, one afternoon, I heard a faint buzz, like a distant lawnmower. I stumbled outside, my vision blurry, and saw a speck in the sky—a helicopter. My heart leaped. I waved my arms, shouting, “Here! I’m here!” My voice was hoarse, but I kept yelling. The helicopter circled, dipping lower, and I saw someone pointing at the roof. They’d seen my message.It landed in a clearing nearby, the roar of the blades drowning out everything. Two men in Coast Guard uniforms jumped out, running toward me. “You okay?” one shouted, his eyes wide as he saw my condition.“Barely,” I said, my voice breaking. “Bear’s been after me for days. I’m hurt—my leg.”“Alright, we’ve got you,” the other said, steadying me as I limped. “Let’s get you out of here.”They half-carried me to the helicopter, my body screaming with every step. As we lifted off, I looked down at the camp—the shack, its door gone, the river glinting, the trees hiding the bear somewhere out there. Relief hit me like a wave, but the fear clung tight, a weight I couldn’t shake.At the hospital in Nome, doctors cleaned and stitched my leg, saying the cuts were deep but I’d heal. My ribs were bruised, not broken, and I was dehydrated and malnourished. “You’re lucky,” one nurse said, shaking her head. “Grizzlies don’t usually let up like that.” I just nodded, too tired to talk. They asked if I’d go back to the camp. “No way,” I said, my voice flat. “That place belongs to the bear now.”I never found out what happened to the grizzly. Maybe it’s still roaming that valley, claiming the river as its own. I came to Alaska chasing gold, a dream of wealth and adventure. Instead, I found terror, the kind that seeps into your bones and never quite leaves. The wilderness is beautiful, but it’s unforgiving. It doesn’t care about your plans or your courage. It just is, and I’ll carry that lesson—and those scars—for the rest of my life.





**“Claws in the Dark: A True Alaskan Nightmare”:**

I’d always been drawn to Alaska’s wild heart, its endless forests and untamed rivers calling to me through books and documentaries. Last summer, I finally got my chance to camp in the Chugach National Forest, a sprawling wilderness that felt like the edge of the world. It was me, my friend Emily, her older brother Tom, and Jake, a guy we’d connected with through a hiking group online. We were all thrilled, picturing a week of fishing, hiking, and escaping the noise of everyday life. But what happened out there turned my dream into a nightmare I still can’t shake.We drove hours from Anchorage, our rented SUV bouncing along a gravel road that dwindled into a dirt path. The campsite, tucked near a clear stream, was perfect—flat ground for our tents, a stone fire pit, and pines so tall they seemed to touch the sky. We set up quickly, laughing as we fumbled with tent poles. Emily, always the optimist, declared it “paradise.” Tom, quieter but practical, started gathering firewood, while Jake, who’d camped in Alaska before, took charge of organizing our gear.“First rule,” Jake said, his voice calm but firm as he tied our food bags high in a tree, “no food in the tents. Bears can smell it from miles away.”I nodded, clipping my bear spray to my belt. “Got it. I read up on bears. Make noise, look big, don’t run.”“Good,” Jake said, glancing at the group. “And stick together on hikes. Bears don’t like surprises.”Emily rolled her eyes, brushing her braid off her shoulder. “You’re gonna make me paranoid, Jake. I’m more scared of tripping over a root than a bear.”Tom snorted, sharpening a stick with his pocketknife. “Speak for yourself. I’m keeping this close.” He patted the knife sheath on his hip.We all laughed, the tension easing. That night, we sat around the fire, the flames crackling as we roasted marshmallows. Jake told stories of his last Alaska trip—moose sightings, a wolf howling in the distance. Emily shared a funny tale about her dog stealing a whole pizza. I felt alive, the stars above us brighter than I’d ever seen.The first two days were everything I’d hoped. We fished in the stream, catching small trout that we cooked over the fire. Our hikes took us through meadows bursting with wildflowers, and once, we spotted a bald eagle circling overhead. Each moment felt like a gift, the forest wrapping us in its quiet beauty. But I noticed little things—snapped twigs, faint scratches on trees—that made me wonder what else was out there, watching.On the third night, I woke to a sound that sent my heart racing. Heavy footsteps, deliberate, crunching through the brush just beyond our tents. I lay frozen, clutching my sleeping bag, straining to hear. The noise stopped, then started again, closer, circling. My flashlight shook in my hand as I unzipped my tent and peeked out. The beam caught nothing but trees and shadows. I whispered to myself, “Probably a deer,” but my gut told me otherwise. I stayed awake for hours, listening, until exhaustion pulled me under.Morning light revealed the truth. Near our food cache, a tree bore deep, fresh claw marks—long, jagged gashes in the bark. My stomach churned as I called the others over.“Guys, you need to see this,” I said, pointing.Emily’s hand flew to her mouth. “Oh my God. Is that… a bear?”Jake knelt, tracing the marks with his finger. “Grizzly. These are big. It was here last night, sniffing around.”Tom’s jaw tightened, his hand resting on his knife. “We should leave. Like, now.”Jake shook his head, standing. “We’re okay if we’re smart. It didn’t get our food. Let’s clean the camp, make noise when we move, and stay in pairs. It’ll probably move on.”Emily looked at me, her eyes wide. “What do you think?”I swallowed hard, glancing at the marks. “I don’t know. I want to stay, but… this is scary.”“We’re prepared,” Jake said. “Bear spray, air horn, rifles. We just need to be loud and careful.”Reluctantly, we agreed. That day, we hiked in twos, me with Jake, Emily with Tom. We sang off-key pop songs, clapped, and shouted “Hey, bear!” every few minutes. My bear spray felt heavy on my belt, my fingers brushing it constantly. The forest, once welcoming, now seemed to hide something in every shadow. I kept picturing those claw marks, imagining eyes watching us.At camp, we scrubbed every surface, ensuring no food scraps remained. Jake showed us how to hang our trash bags higher, using a rope system he’d learned. “Bears are smart,” he said. “If they smell nothing, they’ll leave.”That night, we kept the fire roaring, sitting closer than before. Emily tried to lighten the mood, telling a story about her clumsy coworker, but her voice wavered. Tom stared into the flames, his knife now in his hand, not his sheath. Around midnight, the crashing came again—louder, closer, from the direction of the stream. Jake grabbed his flashlight and air horn, standing slowly.“Stay put,” he whispered, his beam cutting through the dark. He blasted the horn twice, the sound sharp and jarring. The crashing stopped, and we waited, barely breathing.“It’s gone,” Jake said finally, sitting down. “But we keep the fire going all night. No chances.”I nodded, my throat dry. “Should we take turns keeping watch?”“Good idea,” Tom said. “I’ll go first.”Sleep was impossible. Every snap of a twig, every rustle, made my heart leap. I lay in my tent, bear spray clutched like a lifeline, replaying Jake’s words: “Bears don’t like surprises.” But what if this bear didn’t care?By morning, we were exhausted, our eyes red and nerves frayed. Tom found tracks near the stream—huge paw prints, deep in the mud, leading toward our camp. They stopped just outside Emily’s tent. My skin crawled as I pictured the bear standing there, silent, while we slept.“It’s stalking us,” Tom said, his voice low. “This isn’t normal.”Emily’s hands trembled as she packed her water bottle. “I can’t do this. I want to go home.”I felt the same, fear gnawing at me, but we were miles from help. Our pickup wasn’t for three more days, and the ranger station was a two-day hike. “We can make it,” I said, forcing calm. “We stick together, keep making noise.”Jake nodded. “Let’s check the rifles, make sure they’re ready. Just in case.”That day, we stayed close to camp, too rattled to hike far. We reinforced our food cache, tying it even higher, and practiced with the air horn. But the forest felt oppressive now, its silence heavy with threat. I kept glancing over my shoulder, half-expecting to see a bear charging.The fifth night was when it all fell apart. I was in my tent, just drifting off, when a low, guttural growl jolted me awake. It was close—too close—right outside. My hands shook as I grabbed my bear spray and unzipped the flap a fraction. In the faint glow of the fire’s embers, I saw it: a massive grizzly, its fur dark and matted, sniffing the fire pit. Its eyes caught the light, glinting like cold glass.“Jake!” I hissed, my voice barely a whisper. “Bear!”From his tent, Jake answered, “Stay calm. Don’t move.”The bear pawed the ground, then rose on its hind legs, towering over the camp. Its head swung toward Emily’s tent, and I heard her gasp, a small, terrified sound. My pulse hammered, every instinct screaming to run, but I knew that’d be suicide.“Do something,” Tom whispered, his voice shaking.Jake unzipped his tent slowly, air horn in one hand, rifle in the other. “On three,” he said. “One… two… three.”He blasted the horn, the noise splitting the night. The bear dropped to all fours, startled, and Jake fired a shot into the air. The crack echoed, and the bear roared, a sound that vibrated in my chest. It lumbered toward the trees, crashing through the brush, gone.We sat in our tents, silent, waiting for it to return. It didn’t, but none of us slept. At first light, we made a plan. “We’re hiking to the ranger station,” Jake said, his face grim. “We can’t stay here.”Emily wiped tears from her cheeks. “What if it follows us?”“We’ll be loud,” I said, gripping her hand. “It won’t want to deal with us.”Packing was frantic, our hands clumsy with fear. We left non-essentials behind, taking only water, food, and weapons. The hike was brutal—16 miles through dense forest, our voices hoarse from shouting “Hey, bear!” every minute. We moved as a tight group, Jake in front with the rifle, me at the back, scanning behind us. Every rustle made us freeze, every shadow a potential threat.Halfway, Tom tripped, twisting his ankle. He cursed under his breath, leaning on Emily. “I’m fine,” he said, but his face was pale. We slowed, helping him limp along, our fear growing with every step. The forest seemed to close in, the trail narrowing as if urging us back.By dusk on the second day, we saw the ranger station’s roof through the trees. Relief flooded me, but I kept shouting until we reached the door. The ranger, a wiry man with a gray beard, listened as we spilled our story, his expression darkening.“You’re lucky,” he said, handing us water. “That bear was hunting you. Grizzlies don’t usually stalk like that unless they’re desperate or used to human food. Someone probably fed it before.”He called for a truck to drive us to Anchorage, and as we left, I looked back at the forest. Its beauty was still there, but now it felt like a mask hiding something raw and dangerous. In the truck, Emily leaned against me, silent. Tom stared out the window, his ankle wrapped. Jake cleaned his rifle, his hands steady but his eyes distant.Back home, I can’t stop thinking about those nights—the claw marks, the growl, the bear’s eyes locking onto us. I see it in my dreams, hear its roar in quiet moments. We survived because we stayed smart, stayed together, but I know how close we came to not making it. Alaska gave me the adventure I craved, but it also taught me fear—real, bone-deep fear—and a respect for the wild I’ll never lose.

1kok702,https://i.redd.it/whuhpy9ko91f1.jpeg,"Trying the worst rated restaurants in Reno, redditor's choice: The Noble Pie!","Noble Pie won redditor's choice for the worst rated restaurant in Reno! I got an excessive amount of food for the fair price of $60 after delivery.  Which, considering how much other places are, this feels fair. They were voted for 15 times. 

The pizza: I went with a simple cheese pizza, because I feel like if a pizza place doesn't have good cheese pizza, it's a failure. Honestly the pizza hot and fresh was fairly decent, a 6/10, but when cold it was more like a 5. Was not a big fan of the sauce, and I think if presented with Domino's (my favorite chain pizza restaurant) I'd prefer them. My favorite pizza in town is Pizanos, on 1st and Sierra. Their pizza is really good and they have good garlic knots. 

The wings: I got the recommended burg and extra crispy, the wings weren't crispy and I honestly wasn't a fan of the flavor combo? Is burg buffalo? I didn't really like added garlic and green onion, just made a weird flavor combination in my opinion. 5/10. 

Frotchos!: Recommended by u/Lmoneyfresh I got them with sausage, and they were pretty decent, it just boiled down to me personally not liking the flavor combination. It really was a gut bomb. I could see how people could like them so I'm going with a 7/10. They are a really unique idea. 


Overall: 6/10, or 3 stars. It's a decent place. I wouldn't be mad if someone bought them but I personally wouldn't order there again in the two weeks I have left in Reno, lol. 

This was a fun project, and I hope you enjoyed tagging along. I definitely want to try this in Vegas when I move back home and see how local subreddits like it.  I'll try and swing by Juicys off Glendale as they got second place with 10 nominations, but no promises. I'm graduating college and literally shoving everything and my cat into my car and fucking off in two weeks. 

This was a fun little project, so I didn't go browse through my reddit history to make sure nobody was double voting, and again this was just based off of what people were saying. I think I rustled some jimmies when I said 3 people didn't like Thai Lotus.

That being said, eat local. There are some good places.

My favorite restaurants in Reno:

Scoopers

Indian Kebab

Pizanos

Hong Kong Diner

Midnight Coffee Roasting

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) The beautiful game is back, folks! Today, we've got a cracker of a match in the J League as Sanfrecce Hiroshima hosts Tokyo Verdy on May 17, 2025. Let's dive into the stats, odds, and some witty banter to make your betting decision a tad easier.

**The Matchup:** Sanfrecce Hiroshima vs. Tokyo Verdy **Date:** May 17, 2025 **Time:** 05:00 UTC (Yeah, it's an early kickoff, but hey, the coffee's on)

**Odds:** The odds are in, and Sanfrecce Hiroshima is the clear favorite to win, with odds ranging from 1.7 to 1.92 across different bookmakers. Tokyo Verdy, on the other hand, is the underdog, with odds between 4.5 and 4.9. A draw is priced between 3.1 and 3.55.

**Stats and Analysis:** While we don't have the latest stats on the teams' current form, we can infer that Sanfrecce Hiroshima is likely to be the stronger side, given their lower odds. However, Tokyo Verdy has a rich history, having produced many Japanese national team players through their youth development system.

**Injuries and Significant Players:** No specific injury reports are available for this match, but it's worth noting that Sanfrecce Hiroshima's opponent in the previous round wasn't mentioned. However, we did learn that Matsumoto Yamaga FC's goalkeeper, Goda Shota, played a match recently despite being previously suspended. Maybe he's the good boy now?

**Best Bet:** After analyzing the odds, I recommend taking Sanfrecce Hiroshima to win at -0.75 handicap (available at LowVig.ag and BetOnline.ag) for a price of 2.15. This bet offers value, as Sanfrecce Hiroshima is likely to dominate the match. Alternatively, you can simply take Sanfrecce Hiroshima to win outright at odds around 1.85 (available at BetMGM).

**Over/Under:** If you're feeling adventurous, the Over/Under market is also worth exploring. BetRivers offers an Over 2.5 at 2.4, while LowVig.ag and BetOnline.ag have Over 2.0 at 1.92. If you think the match will be a high-scoring affair, these might be worth a punt.

There you have it, folks! Sanfrecce Hiroshima is the team to back in this J League matchup. Place your bets, grab a coffee (or two), and enjoy the beautiful game!

1kok5mu,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1kok5mu/whats_with_my_friends_lately/,what’s with my friends lately?,"Just wanna share something that’s been bothering me a bit lately.

For context, let me describe a bit about my life (not to brag po para lang po may context — which is i think baka eto po kaya yung pinanggagalingan ng reactions ng friends ko whenever I’m around?)

Physically, I’d say I’m okay-looking, and now that I’m working, I get to wear the kind of outfits I really like, elegant, clean, put-together. Professionally, I’d say I’ve done well for myself. I have a title, I’m fairly compensated, I can travel naman when I want, and I can spend slow days at coffee shops just chilling if I feel like it.

I’m not the type to brag about these things. I wasn’t raised that way, and honestly, I’m just grateful for everything I have.

Now here’s the part that’s been bothering me:
Whenever I catch up with my long-term friends over coffee, syempre may life updates. We’d usually ask each other what we’ve been up to, and as for me, I’m well aware that they’ve probably seen on social media that I’ve been traveling or doing stuff. But whenever I share something like “oh, we went to this place recently,” the convo just gets brushed off or moved on from real quick.

Meanwhile, if it’s their turn to share, the conversation goes on for several minutes and everyone’s super engaged. :(

And lately, I can’t help but feel na parang off yung vibe whenever I’m around. I can’t explain it well, but I get this quiet feeling that they’re somehow happier when I’m not there. Even on Instagram, if I post something about a trip (especially to a place I know they’ve also dreamed of visiting), wala man lang comment. I know we can’t really travel together anymore because of our different schedules (hello, adulting), pero still…

What gets me is that I do show support—simple likes, comments, cheering them on. But in person, when I share my own life updates, it just feels like no one really cares.

I’ve been three times total and was able to get Labubu’s twice. I purchased 1 the first time and 2 the second time.

Things to know:
-It can get COMPETITIVE. People may sprint or sneak in before doors open. 
-First person in line usually buys all the Big Into Energies.
-machine can hold up to 5 of each kind. 
-kinds I’ve seen available: Big into Energy, Exciting Macaron, Have a Seat, and the occasional exclusives: Coca-Cola Series and Let’s Checkmate.
-Total availability has ranged from 15-22 labubus


Method that has been successful for me: 
-show up about 10 minutes before 9:30 am.
-go to Caribou Coffee and wait inside for the gate to open or wait outside the mall doors next to Caribou. It’s hard to say which one will open first.
-as soon as they open, speed walk to the Level 2 vending machine next to Victoria’s Secret. 
-pray to the gods that luck will be in your favor.

Method that has been unsuccessful for me:
-going to the back doors closest to the L2 vending machine. Doors didn’t open until after 9:35 am & the line was too long by then. 

Other observations:
-Monday had the least amount of people. I didn’t get there until 9:40 am and I still managed to get the last Labubu. 
-Wednesday had the most amount of people. I think because there’s a rumor going around that they restock Tuesday nights. They restock every night. 
-Friday had a few more people than Monday but I was able to get 2 Labubus by getting there 10 minutes before 9:30am. 

Mysterious afternoon restock:
-allegedly they restock sometime in the afternoon but I’ve never been able to confirm this myself. 

Good luck & go get those Labubus!!!

TLDR:
Go to the mall doors by caribou coffee 10 minutes before doors open at 9:30 am. Rush to  L2 vending machine next to Victoria’s Secret.

She’s not just a queen, she’s a storm in silk.","sabella It was almost 4 in the evening when I finished my work in a coffee shop, so I hurried my way to the house. I don't call that place home because home is where you feel safe and this place is my nightmare. I still have to prepare dinner and get ready. I reach at the house and go in the kitchen. I see that some chefs are already preparing the dinner. That means someone important is going to come. I was leaving the kitchen when my aunt suddenly saw me and held my arm in death grip, her fake nails were digging in my skin. She dragged me into the living room and snarled, ""If you are done whoring around like your mother go and get ready into something presentable. We don't want other people to know the bimbo that you are."" I whimpered as she roughly pushed me on the ground not before telling me to cover my bruises properly. Not wanting to cry I go into my room and start getting ready. I wear a simple red colored dress that has small white hearts and cover my visible bruises with makeup. I get ready and go upstairs to see if everything is perfect or not. I was arranging the couch cushions when my cousin Vanessa came downstairs wearing a very sheer black corset style dress. I wonder how she manages to breath in that dress. ""Eww! What are you wearing? It's so ugly but not as ugly as you."" Says the one with fake lips and nose job. My subconscious chided. I ignored her and continue what I was doing. Few minutes later my uncle and aunt came down in the living room. My uncle dragged me into a corner and threatened me, ""Keep your head down and don't talk unless you are told to. These people are dangerous and won't hesitate to put a bullet in your head. I really don't care but I have to keep you alive for next two years so don't mess up or you will regret it."" I meekly nodded yes sir and go into the kitchen. The chefs who came to prepare the food are long gone. I start to arrange the cutlery on the dining table when doorbell rang. I quietly go outside and see that my uncle opening the door. There entered three masterpieces of human but what shocked me more was that two of them were the same ones who came to the café in the morning. Two of them seem to be of same age but one of them looked a year or so younger. This is going to be a long night, I thought. Alexander I'm the Mafia leader. David Thompson is a vile man who borrowed 20 millions for his business few months but hasn't returned it. We warned him few days ago but he didn't responded so now we are going to his house. Nodding at him we went into my car. I sit at the driving seat, but Jacob and Nate are fighting to sit on the passenger seat. Childish much! I roll my eyes at them and shout, "" Sbrigatevi, cazzo ragazzi"" (hurry you guys). Jacob comes and sit on the passenger seat and Nate went to sit at the back with a pout. I roll my eyes at his antics. After driving for around half hour we reach his place. It is a medium sized house. Jacob rings the bell and David opened the door and ushered us inside. There were three women in the hallway. One of them was around David's age, I assume she is his wife. There were two other girls who looked like they were of same age. But I was shocked when I saw the same girl I saw at the café. I quickly cover my shocked expression with blank face. I'm here for business. David introduced his wife Veronica and his daughter Vanessa but didn't introduce the other girl. Jacob noticed that and asked, ""Who is she?"" pointing to her. David answered with a fake sweet smile that she is his niece Isabella. Isabella, it suits her. She is wearing a cute red dress with little hearts on it. She is looking beautiful even without wearing revealing clothes like Vanessa and Veronica. We made our way to the dining room. I had to sit next to Vanessa and God she can't keep he hands to herself. I saw Isabella sat across me. She started filling her plate when Veronica said, ""How much will you eat? You are already fat."" Isabella put back more than half of her food back. I am already getting irritated because of Vanessa's antics and now what Veronica did added fuel to my anger. I wanted this to be over already. We finish the dinner and go o David's study. I threatened him to give my money within a month or else he would be good as dead meat. After discussing few other things we went outside. David insisted to stay for drinks so we agreed. I sat on the couch and unfortunately that Vanessa came and sit beside me. No wait, she almost sat on my lap. I politely scooted a bit from her. I was annoyed by her behavior. Can't someone take a hint? Nate was snickering and Jacob was trying to control his laughter. I glared at them and they both shut up. Good for them. ... David ordered Isabella to do something and she left the room. Isabella came back in the room after few minutes and started serving drinks to everyone. Vanessa suddenly made Isabella stumble by putting her foot in the way. Luckily she didn't stumble and regained her balance. David suddenly got angry, ""You bimbo, can't you do one thing properly without making mistakes. You are a disappointment"" David roared and slapped her hard. All three of us were shocked but Vanessa and Veronica seemed unfazed by this behavior like it like this happens regularly. This was his last straw, ""Enough! hijo de puta, ¿cómo te atreves a abofetearla? (You jerk how dare you slap her?) I don't do business with people who hit women. Forget about the deal. I was going to give some time to return the money but now you will pay us back within a week."" We maybe mafia but we are taught not to put hands on women or children. Ma will whoop our asses if she finds out if we did anything. David started stammering and begging to give him some more time but we didn't pay any heed and left the house. After what happened in there I needed drink. I dropped Nathan and Jacob at house and then went to a club. I went into the VIP section and ordered my regular whiskey neat. There were so many women trying to get my attention but none of them appealed me so I went home. I took shower and went to bed.

Years of binging fanfic has similarly left me desensitised to all the horny, kinky fandom tropes. I mean, I love posts in this sub that ask: “Does anyone have a copy of the fic where Rey works in a coffee shop and Ben is a priest and they pretend to be a couple to go to Endor for the ewok knotting gangbang then Rey goes into heat and Ben grows tentacles? Thx in advance love u!”

The sun is shining. The birds are chirping. We’re sitting on the patio of a dive bar. I’ve taken over the touch tunes and in the background we’re listening to two old guys relive their glory days. One looks over and tells you your lady is “very pretty” you blush, I tell the gentleman that I’m not your lady. He takes this as an opportunity to cover my tab. He doesn’t know it covers us both - you’re welcome. After we finish off the 3rd pitcher of cheap beer we ordered and make small talk with the bartender, I tell the old guy goodbye and we leave just in time to catch the hot dog cart outside. Since the tab was paid for us, I cover the dogs. I eat 3 and you stare in utter amazement how a girl so sweet and down to earth can guzzle a glizzy like that. I smile. We drunkenly kiss for a while and then we go our separate ways never to speak again. But every time you see a hot dog you think of me and that day we shared in May. 

This could be us, but we probably don’t live in the same place, state, time zone or even country. But hey, wishful thinking and if we ever do meet, beer and a hot dog on me! 

I’m down to earth, easy going and I don’t stress the small stuff. I’m not looking for anything specific but I expect any relationship I hold - romantic or platonic - to be reciprocal. If we can’t laugh together I don’t want it. I’d prefer long term connection over short. If you think your life is likely to implode next week - I’m probably not for you. Be up front and be transparent and we will be fine. 

My interests/hobbies include but are not limited to: 

•Being creative: crafting, writing, trying a new medium and leaving projects undone. So many projects undone. 

•Watching sports: preferably the NFL & MLB. I like the 49ers and the SF Giants. Because just like my taste in men, my sports teams on occasion are good, and then they’re really bad most of the time. I also recently went to an NHL impeccable vibes. Still no clue what was happening. Loved the vibes though. 

•Weight Lifting: I’m a strong girl, my goal this year is to leg press 1,000lbs and maybe read up on power lifting. Right now it’s strength focused with that one goal of leg press. I’ve found everyone likes stats so:  I squat 400, I can’t really bench press anymore  due to a shoulder injury (but I try) and my dead lift varies on how much I drank the day before. 

•Coffee/Beer/Wine: More so the experience of consuming these things. Trying new coffee shops on the weekend, beer and corn hole with friends on a Sunday afternoon, a wine bar and tapas for a change of pace in the evening. If someone’s pouring I’m drinking. 

•Concerts/Shows/Live Music: I have been to 200+. I have tickets to quite a few already this year and will probably get more. I love music and I love discovering music. You’ll find me at my local record store at least 3x a month. I will take over a TouchTunes at any bar and I will always play RHCP whether it’s the vibe or not. 

Here is me: https://imgur.com/a/KW81Cpy  5’6ish. Thick. Again lifts weights. Eats hot dogs. Yada yada. Would also love to see a photo of you sooner rather than later. Attraction needs to be mutual. Lucky for you my type is a melting pot. 

I don’t like video games or anime. You can have your hobby’s but these seem to be prevalent in a lot of people as personality traits. So hobby? Fine. Literally the only thing you do on the weekends? Not for me!

1kojokb,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1kojokb/sudden_personality_switch/,Sudden personality switch?,"I'm guessing at least a few of you guys can relate to this or hopefully can shed light on this:

Has anyone had a SO that, for all practical purposes, was a good spouse for many years before going full-blown narc? Specifically, in my situation, I have been with my husband for over a decade and while sure there were some odd ball red flags here and there throughout the years, for some reason the past two have been a total nightmare.  On some level we used to have the marriage my friends dreamed about or at least on the surface level my friends dreamed about, however, I'm not sure why, but there was a distinct personality switch almost exactly two years ago in my husband where he began seeing everything in life as binary ie good or bad.  If he disagrees with a person or a person somehow inadvertently hurt him (textbook the sky is falling, it must be anyone but my own's fault kind of thinking) they are immediately labeled as bad and he will unfriend them on social media, evict them, uninvite them to things, disown, etc.

Right now after seeing him increasingly turn on family and friends, he is now dead set on divorcing me, apparently I am a ""bad"" person, this is after years of otherwise a very loving marriage.  I am currently so confused, as while like anyone else he had his blindspots with self-awareness ex. being confused why someone might have finished his coffee or ice cream (when no one touched it or would have cared to touch it) which really seemed rather minor when things were good, he was otherwise a great guy capable of empathy and stepping up for friends in need when no one else would. Part of me is rethinking, was he only being empathetic because he had onlookers to impress, or did his personality really do a 180? I'm so confused how someone I admired for teaching me how to be a better communicator early on in our relationship is suddenly incapable of it, overwhelmed with everything in life, and perhaps most concernedly thinking people are out to intentionally hurt him, ex. he doesn't trust me, he claims he's afraid I'll poison him, or that I will dig through his things, or that should he send me to the grocery store with his credit card I will somehow run off to the mall and ""ruin"" him by putting a drastic bill on his card (something that has never-ever happened). It's as if his ability to think rationally and logically is gone.  His ability to empathize is kaput. Almost everything is a perceived slight, which further confuses me, and no matter how I phrase something (even if I switch it up to his suggested phrasing), it's never quite right or good enough ie, moving target/goal posts.

I'm concerned that for whatever reason he has some weird late onset NPD or other cluster B personality disorder.  I'm screamed at in the middle of the night, thankfully now he has decided to move out so most nights I can get a full nights sleep (apparently he does not feel safe around me because I do not respect his ""boundaries"" and therefore cannot live with me or ironically any of his family members).  I tried reaching out to his family, but the response was to block me.  I'm concerned because I know bipolar runs in his family and while I know right now I need to prioritize keeping myself safe, I am also worried for him as someone who has known him for well over a decade and has witnessed this spiral. I'm not sure what to do.  I'm not sure if anyone has experienced such a thing.  Right now, I feel my only option is to learn all I can about divorce and get some legal consultations done to tease out what representation will be right for me, however, I cannot help shake the nagging feeling in my head something is not right, I keep wondering is it induced by his ADHD stimulant medication which times out about right, or perhaps long COVID, or any other number of explainable etiologies. It also doesn't help that when I mentioned to friends what had been going on, the first thing they asked was if he had a brain tumor or something, because it seemed so out of character for him.

He now screams at me that he hates me, that he intends to cheat on me, and certainly wants me to think he is cheating on me, even though he as admitted he's had no such luck.  Like this is a guy who was still deeply in love with me or so he claimed just over 2 years ago.

Additional context: I did lose my job around the same time point two years ago through something very traumatic that resulted in a legal settlement, however, due to the ongoing emotional abuse of increasing nature since that point in time & subsequent work-related PTSD, I'm having a horrible time trying to get through my PTSD therapy so that I may successfully hold down a job again, hence I am currently unemployed. On one hand, I would think okay, maybe financial hardship or perceived financial hardship could have spurred some of this, but part of me is so bewildered.  I've even been doing at least 90% of the household chores/shopping/other responsibilities to make up for my lack of financial contribution (which I have sense learned is not healthy, but as of now he won't lift a finger or speak to me) I'm also not sure if I just some how emasculated him as he had so many people in his personal life and family telling him repeatedly how proud they were of me, which he very quickly grew sick of hearing, and while he will tell others he's proud of me or agrees with them when they say they are, behind closed doors he wants me to verbally say I regret pursuing the legal matter.  And in general since that point in time if I do anything remotely useful such as solve a problem he or a group of people including both of us is trying to tackle I get scolded by him that I should keep my mouth shut or asked why I have to be such a know-it-all.  I'm talking about minor one off observations, in at least one instance I simply read the instruction booklet he didn't want to read.

Also pertinent: After about 1.5 years of this and at the strong suggestion of multiple therapists, I did end up secretly recording our conversations so that I could confirm my reality. My head was so confused by this point, and my self-doubt was so prevalent that I found myself regularly asking others for confirmation or how to feel about a situation.  Eventually, he did find out about this, which he told me was a betrayal of his trust (mind you after he had already been repeatedly telling me he wanted a divorce every 2 weeks, telling me multiple times things didn't happen - which at this point part of me truly wonders if he didn't remember doing said things to me or treating me a certain way, I know in theory this is part of the game, but its historically unlike him unless I've just been that manipulated).  While he has always prided himself at being good at manipulating others (another early redflag), I always figured he wasn't or couldn't pull such a thing on me, maybe I was wrong all along?  The other weird thing that has me thinking something medical is going on is that he goes in these weird cycles of mania (staying up much of the night binge cleaning, or working, only to sleep a couple of hours, being grandiose and impulsive), followed by low energy depressive states at which time he historically when he would actually talk to me tell me he was feeling suicidal (which of course I treated as a real concern - eventually contacting his family for further help, only for him to deny it, and I've figured it out either it was real and I did the right thing treating it as such or it was fake and used to manipulate me further).  Apparently, I violated his trust by reaching out to his family over this concern, even though I myself was incredibly overwhelmed at all of this. And his impulsivity become so much so he actually decided within a day or two of coming up with the idea to schedule a cosmetic surgery consult, only to have surgery a total of 8 days later!  He's always been sensitive about his self-image and insecure, but it's like everything is on steroids now and all the kind, sweet, empathetic, kind of guy you look up to attributes vanished overnight.

It's just all so surreal to me that this guy who we almost never fought, its like we shared a mind for so many years, and even during the pandemic joked about how there was never even a point where we almost broke-up because we just were never that couple, but now all of a sudden he can't trust me, that apparently I just make his life miserable and more difficult (and again, it didn't originate with me, for a while he would alternate between threatening to evict his brother and divorce me or disown various friends/family members for perceived slights such as not being invited on an outing or if he was invited for not taking what he wanted to do to heart, etc.  All things he rarely if ever used to do.  I'm not sure if it was always there on some level and something just kicked it up to the top level or if this is a new thing for him.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? Any advice? Can the love bombing stage last for a decade? Did I break him? I really want to get him help, I know it might not result in our marriage being saved at this point, but I am genuinely also concerned about his well-being, regardless, as it seems he is on the verge of a mental breakdown.

Has anyone left someone in a similar scenario, only to find out there was a plausible cause of the personality shift? Is it possible this is just what the end of a marriage looks like and I'm just unfamiliar in that territory?

So, picture this: You’re a freelancer or consultant, working your magic, and suddenly that little voice in your head is like, “Hey, don’t forget about retirement savings!” But honestly, it can get confusing. Should you go for a **Solo 401(k)** or a **SEP IRA**? 🤔

I get it; it feels like choosing between coffee or tea: both have their perks, but choosing the right one can make a world of difference for your future. So let’s break it down, shall we?

### **Solo 401(k) vs. SEP IRA: The Showdown**

**1. Contribution Limits**  
This is where things get exciting! 🎉
- **Solo 401(k)**: You can contribute both as an employee (up to $22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you’re 50+) and as an employer. If you really want to max out, that can add up to **$66,000** total (or $73,500 if you’re over 50). That’s some serious stash!
- **SEP IRA**: You can contribute up to **25% of your net earnings**, with a cap of **$66,000** for 2023. Not bad, but not as flexible as the Solo 401(k).

**2. Flexibility**  
- **Solo 401(k)**: If you feel like playing the long game, this one allows you to choose whether or not to make contributions each year. So if this year's income is lower, you can chill a bit.
- **SEP IRA**: Super straightforward but less flexible. You have to decide on your contribution amounts based on your profit—less wiggle room here.

**3. Loans**  
- **Solo 401(k)**: Need a quick cash boost for an emergency or an opportunity? You can borrow against this bad boy. Just remember to pay it back, because nobody likes a grumpy retirement fund! 
- **SEP IRA**: Nope, no loans here. It’s more like that friend who holds onto your secrets forever. Good for security, not for cash flow.

**4. Administration**  
- **Solo 401(k)**: Can come with a bit of administrative work, especially if your balance hits $250,000. But with a little effort, you’ll be a pro in no time!
- **SEP IRA**: Super easy breezy to set up and manage. It’s like ordering pizza—no fuss, just immediate satisfaction.

**So, what’s the best choice for you?** Here’s a quick cheat-sheet to help decide:

- **Consider your income level**: If you're raking in the dough, a Solo 401(k) might give you more bang for your buck.
- **Future planning**: Do you want to boost your savings potential significantly? Look at the Solo 401(k).
- **Simplicity**: If you want something easy and straightforward, SEP IRA is your best bud.

Now, I know it sounds a bit overwhelming, right? But remember: **Set realistic goals. Stay focused. Go home satisfied.** That’s what it’s all about! 🌈✨

1kojhpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/bxo/comments/1kojhpm/ls_bxo_autoimmune_disease_part_2/,LS (BXO) Autoimmune Disease – Part 2,"Dear comrades,

I would like to delve into some additional details and summarize them to make things easier for everyone. Even though my previous post was lengthy and detailed, many still have questions, which I completely understand.

First and foremost, it's important to recognize that LS is an autoimmune disease. In reality, the medical community doctors know virtually nothing about it. We, who live with it, undoubtedly understand it far better than the medical field does. In my case, I've observed many aspects and have found some answers, and I believe many of you have as well.

I don't know about you, but for me, LS began when I made a bizarre and foolish mistake being ""aroused,"" I injured my glans and caused trauma. Everything started after that, which made the entire experience even more depressing and bizarre for me. I've come to terms with that fact now, but thinking that if I hadn't done that one thing, none of this would have happened leads to a psychological hell. Now, I realize that perhaps it was meant to be, that it taught me something, and now I'm here, writing to you, feeling like it's my sacred duty.

Philosophically speaking, LS was waiting for me, and my autoimmune system was compromised. But honestly, I believe that if I hadn't put my penis into the plush that injured me, LS wouldn't have occurred I truly believe that. Why am I sharing all this? Maybe because, in the end, how you ended up with LS matters—or maybe it doesn't. I wonder and feel for people who tell me that even after weeks of steroid use, they don't reach remission. It doesn't make much sense that it's because I contracted the disease in a certain way, while for many of you, it appeared spontaneously.

That's one point, but more importantly:

As an autoimmune disease, the term itself implies that you need to significantly boost your immune system. If you haven't focused on that before, now is the time to start healing the disease from within. That means taking vitamins A, D, and C, Omega-3, plenty of everything—vitamin E, turmeric, anything that combats inflammation. Drink these every morning, literally every day, whatever you can. Also, avoid consuming tons of sugar and sweets, don't smoke excessively, and steer clear of all those toxic sodas and junk.

I'm fortunate to live a minimalist lifestyle where I enjoy marijuana and psychedelic substances, alternative things, advocate for a healthy life, am obsessed with vegetables and many supplements, hate coffee, cigarettes, and soda. So, I don't have the problem of needing to eliminate anything—except occasionally indulging in something sweet. The point here is that you probably need to boost your immune system first and fight from within. Then, perhaps the corticosteroid therapy will be more effective. That's just one of my hypotheses.

In my case, remember, I started the therapy as the doctor advised, but I stopped after 3-4 days. I didn't reach remission. However, I spent the entire year strictly consuming all natural supplements. Then, a year later, I followed the same 14-day steroid regimen as the doctor initially suggested, and magic happened. You won't believe it—on the 14th day, when I applied the steroid, I saw the white patch on the rim of my glans, both left and right, becoming even more visible and larger. It seemed to have culminated. I thought on that 14th day, feeling very depressed, ""Oh God, what am I doing? This steroid is making things worse."" I went to sleep, woke up, and saw that everything that looked worse had started to fade. Suddenly, the white patches, which are the most irritating if you have them on the rim of the penis, began to fade. Each day, they faded more, and although I was sure they would return soon, they didn't. That's when I knew I was in remission.

The white lines that covered my foreskin also started to fade during the first week of steroid use. They seemed easier to combat, perhaps because the foreskin's skin is more manageable than the glans. But the white spots—there were three, two on one side and one on the other side of the glans rim—disappeared only after two weeks.

Another possible reason why some haven't experienced this yet or why someone has a more severe form of LS could be the type of penis. I assume that many guys with a fully covered penis, completely closed type, have gone through a much worse ordeal, leading to circumcision and phimosis because they produce much more moisture, which is a disaster for LS. I have a semi-open penis—I could easily retract my foreskin at any time. Occasionally, my foreskin would become inflamed, and then a drop of urine or when it was closed and then opened would cause pain, burning, discomfort, and definite unease. But I emphasize once again, when the cycle of foreskin inflammation and everything else dries out—as it did for me I believe that once it dries out, there's nothing left to inflame, and the foreskin heals itself, and LS sterilizes the penis itself. Suddenly, I missed all my moisture, and I talked about it myself. But during the days when the disease was active, that was the least of my problems because suddenly, there were no more inflammations. Now, when the penis is, after all, dry and clean, I made sure that urine didn't accumulate much and generally easily achieved auto-circumcision because my penis type is like that. Generally, the steroid pulled the disease back, but it did leave a somewhat ""after-battle"" raw look to my foreskin. So, guys with a completely closed penis and a lot of foreskin are affected a bit more.

How do you know you're in remission? Simply, if there are white lines on the foreskin, they must disappear, and the skin should return to its normal state without those small striae, as in my case. Then, the glans if you have a white patch on the rim of the glans, LS is present. If it disappears, as in my case, it's gone. Also, it's mentioned that those white spots can cause problems they suddenly become annoying during friction, sex, or whatever. Whenever I felt that LS like tingling not exactly burning, but more of that LS-tingling sensation—it always came from that area. I always felt that the root of the problem was there, those white round blisters—one main blister on one side and another next to it. Generally, the sign of remission is definitely when the blisters recede, as well as the white lines and other marks on the foreskin. Of course, depigmentation and scars remain—that's the scar tissue. Then, all my emphasis on natural care comes into play when you reach the point where only those two remain, and everything else has cleared.

So, as you can see, I want to explain things in several points. First, because of the autoimmune disease, we must significantly boost our immunity and change our lifestyle. That way, we set the stage for steroids to eventually take care of things and pull the disease back. We can't just jump to steroid creams without having done anything to bring some health into ourselves.

I emphasize again—so, a year before I completed the steroid therapy, I worked extensively on my immunity. Regarding supplements good for LS, we summarize everything, considering how you contracted the disease, perhaps its root in your body and immunity. We must put everything on paper.",1,1747452522.0,bxo,1,1.0,False

Thursday night I went out with friends, and borrowed one of my friends purse. This was a real leather, purse she was gifted, bought in Madrid (estimated at least $500). Long story short, I ended up leaving the purse outside by accident all night (we were outside drinking on the porch). I would estimate we went inside around 5 am? 

I feel incredibly guilty, there are no words to even express it. She is being so nice about it and keeps saying it’s just an object, but I have to get this purse back somehow. I know how unlikely it is but I need some tips if anyone has any. 

2 debit cards, 1 credit card, my ID, health insurance (all in my wallet), and some controlled prescription adhd meds were in the purse. I did mention all of this to the police.

I have already cancelled all cards, and made a police report. With some statements on my bank account, I was able to get a coffee shop to show me security camera footage of a random man using my card to buy coffee. He had a big backpack on as well, so I’m wondering if the purse may be in it, and there’s a chance he didn’t dump it. Idk. He also used it at a smoke shop, so I’ll be going there as well to get a clearer pic. 

In all honesty, I don’t care about what’s inside the purse. I just need the purse back, no matter how unlikely it is. I plan on looking around our neighborhood, dumpsters or trash cans to see if it was disposed of after taking everything out. I also plan on calling local pawn shops.

Anyone have any other tips/advice to get this purse back? Like I said, I do have a police report, but it has been almost 24 hours by now and I feel like I need to act quick to have a chance of finding it. So most of the stuff I’ve been doing has been on my own. Any advice for what I should ask the police for help as well? I’ve been emailing my officer, but I’m wondering if I just need to show up in person or something. Idk I’ve never made a report like this.

I realize compared to everything else going on in this town, a stolen purse is not an emergency to the police, which I fully understand. It is an emergency for me however, so any advice is welcome!!

1kojea2,https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/1kojea2/living_through_helene_in_asheville_reflections/,Living Through Helene in Asheville - Reflections and lessons,"Background: My family and I live in Asheville, NC, and last fall we rode out the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. I have been urban homesteading and low-level prepping just outside of the city since a few years before COVID. The pandemic showed some folks close to me that I'm not entirely crazy to imagine that resource distribution systems and social order are not 100% rock solid forever.  Our preps have ramped up gradually to what I'd call medium level. We garden veggies and greens, I hunt for game meat, can meals and veggies with water bath and pressure, have a couple of chest freezers in the basement, a few shelves of canned foods and dry beans, packed a go-bag, trained wilderness first aid, stock water filtration and camp cooking gear, keep extra gas and propane on hand, etc. That kind of thing. Not end-of-the-world restart civilization level stuff, but thinking ahead a little. One thing I didn't have going into it was a generator, but we bought after about a week when the food began to spoil.

When Helene hit we really had no idea how bad it would be. I knew we'd lose power and have a wet basement, but the power went out on a Wednesday night and didn't come back on for seventeen days. Cell service was gone for almost that long, which I think no one predicted. The water system for the entire city of 80,000 people failed on about the second day, and it didn't come back online for almost two months. All roads in and out of town were impassable for several days, including the interstates. Water tank trucks and emergency food showed up at distribution sites around town after a couple lanes of highway got dug out. Schools were out for the entire month of October. 

(Disclaimers: I'm just one guy. I don't speak for anyone else. I'm not pushing an agenda or have any grievances. My family was extremely lucky to avoid injury or major property damage. Many, many people had it far worse than us. Also, I live just outside town past some farms. I didn't experience life in the downtown city setting, so forgive me if I'm ignorant of different goings on in denser neighborhoods.)

**Lessons and reflections from my experience:**

1. Most people defaulted immediately to being really genuinely good. The sense of community support, generosity, and good will was palpable. Lots of people set up roadside kitchens and gave away food, restaurants fed whole neighborhoods, churches became distribution hubs, folks drove around clearing debris with their work equipment, and on and on and on. Yes, there was some looting of some stores. That sucks. Yes, there were some robberies of TV's from empty houses and other businesses. But overall I didn't hear of roving bands of criminals with guns taking advantage of the weak even though law enforcement was pretty well tied up full-time with rescue and recovery for a while. I didn't hear anyone talking politics or sniping or price gouging. It was a lot of love and support, and everyone also took a turn needing to accept help and support too.

2. Know your neighbors. Folks in my neighborhood already help each other out with watering plants and holding the mail when we're out of town and we all talk regularly and have a baseline of trust. This made it easy to come together during the blackout and have a neighborhood plan for communication and emergency situations. And who had what resources and protection. It would have been tougher to knock on a stranger's door and introduce myself during the emergency.

3. Communication was key. We felt very isolated from the rest of town and the world for a long time. I stupidly had no battery powered radio prior to the event, so I found myself sitting in the car for the daily radio briefings. On streetcorners folks set up whiteboards for information about food, medicine, activities, gatherings, and requests for supplies.

4. Doing every little thing took more time and energy than you'd think. All the coordination of light, water, cleaning, timing, supplies, made each meal kind of a big deal. Days turned into missions: ""Today we're going out to look for water refills..."" ""Today we're getting groceries and ice...."" ""Today we're going to go check on Julie and then go sit outside the library where they say there's wifi signal so we can email our parents and let them know we're OK."" 

5. Toilets need to flush. That's a big draw of water that became very apparent quickly. Gray water for this purpose became as valuable as drinking water. Able-bodied folks went door-to-door hauling water buckets for flushing at apartment buildings and nursing homes.

6. Showers go away with no city water. We have a spring that feeds garden hoses, so we set up an outdoor shower with a tarp for privacy. Neighbors came by regularly to get clean, and a lot of people around town had a rougher go of it, I think.

7. Flashlights and headlamps are great, but having a room lit up with a lamp was desireable. After Helene I purchased several [small Ryobi converters](https://www.homedepot.com/pep/RYOBI-150-Watt-Power-Source-for-ONE-18V-Battery-Tool-Only-RYi150BG/308460871?source=shoppingads&locale=en-US&pla&mtc=SHOPPING-BF-CDP-GGL-D25P-028_007_POWER_GENERATION-NA-NA-NA-PMAX-NA-NA-NA-NA-NBR-NA-NA-NA-PMAX_GENERATORS_PLA_TEST&cm_mmc=SHOPPING-BF-CDP-GGL-D25P-028_007_POWER_GENERATION-NA-NA-NA-PMAX-NA-NA-NA-NA-NBR-NA-NA-NA-PMAX_GENERATORS_PLA_TEST-20950135823--&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20950137107&gbraid=0AAAAADq61UfBFoUwa-38gdHsy-1wVdnxL&gclid=Cj0KCQjwxJvBBhDuARIsAGUgNfhEJWNxu_6cNZBiHPSYhZW1uJ2DlC_GImETbo7w3h3WqJIUFyR33n4aAiY1EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) to sit on my tool batteries and provide one plug for a room lamp anywhere in the house. 

8. My chest freezers stayed cold longer than I expected. I kept them closed and had a temperature probe. They took about three or four days to go from -5 to 32 degrees. Then another day to get up to about 40. At that point I abandoned them and did what I could to salvage my game meat with a community venison stew and a round of pressure canning. 

9. Dual fuel generator was a game-changer. At first we said ""We should get a generator when this is over."" Then after a week with no power we said, ""What the hell are we talking about? We need a generator right now!"" With propane it ran at full blast and went through those tanks quickly. Then I switched to gasoline and it allowed the motor to drop down when not drawing power and that fuel seemed to last longer overall. We ran it a few hours at a time twice a day to cool the fridge and recharge phones and headlamp batteries.

10. Cooking: I had a big propane burner for canning which was a bit too much for cooking meals and a small backpacking camp stove for boiling water that was not enough for meals. I needed a goldilocks middle way. After the storm I bought a GasOne dual burner propane stove. A Coleman camp stove would have also done the trick. 

11. We had extra coffee beans but no way to grind them with no power. I now have a hand grinder. I like it better, and we use it now for daily coffee instead of the electric grinder.

12. What got gone from store shelves quickly (and I was glad to have extra on hand!) 10W-30 motor oil, hand sanitizer, batteries. 

13. Cash is king. No power means no credit card readers. I was very glad for my cash stash.

14. Sundown was bedtime. I slept better than I have in years after wearing myself out everyday running around doing stuff. When power and cell service and the internet came back up I spent an extra couple of days slowly reintegrating. It felt weird to get texts and read the news again. Very thin and distant after living so deliberately for an extended period. I really really didn't care about what policitician said what about what. People were helping each other load water jugs and dig out from destroyed homes and living in tents on the high school lawn with helicopters flying rescue missions and delivering feed to trapped livestock. TV jerks arguing about whose fault it was or who didn't help enough was white noise to me.

Last week I visited a friend an hour north of Asheville in Burnsville, which got hit really hard. The beautiful river is all gouged out and gravelly, totally different now. It's a constant sadness to see. Across the road were foundations of three houses. My friend told me that their neighbor who lived there was killed when his house was picked up and washed away. The neighbors in the other two houses got out and lived, but there's nothing left of their homes but concrete foundations. Everything they own is downstream somewhere in the riverbanks and in the trees. And this played out thousands of times all around the mountains. We'll be cleaning out the rivers and streams and mud for years.

If you're curious about anything I didn't mention here, please feel free to ask. I learned a lot, and I hope others can benefit from the crazy misfortune that this whole beautiful area is still dealing with. ",32,1747452206.0,preppers,1,0.97,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) The rain gods have finally taken a break, and the LG Twins are ready to take on the KT Wiz in the rescheduled matchup. After a 6-game winning streak, the Twins lost steam, dropping 7 of their last 10 games. But they're looking to bounce back against a struggling KT Wiz.

Let's get to the numbers. The LG Twins are favored to win, with odds ranging from 1.57 to 1.62 across various sportsbooks. The KT Wiz, on the other hand, are priced between 2.28 and 2.51. The Twins have a -1.5 run spread, which is a relatively modest margin considering their recent form.

Now, here's the interesting part: the totals. The over/under is set at 7.5 or 8 runs, depending on the sportsbook. Given the Twins' recent struggles on offense and the KT Wiz's mediocre pitching, I'm leaning towards the under.

**Best Bet:** Under 8 runs (1.86 on MyBookie.ag) or Under 7.5 runs (1.76 on FanDuel)

The reasoning? The LG Twins have been inconsistent on offense, and the KT Wiz have been, well, KT Wiz. Their pitching hasn't been spectacular, but they've managed to keep games relatively low-scoring. With the Twins still trying to get their offense going, I expect a more subdued contest.

If you're feeling bold, you can also take the LG Twins -1.5 run spread, but I'm not convinced they'll blow the game open. The KT Wiz might not be the most potent offense, but they've shown some spark, and the Twins' bullpen has been a bit leaky of late.

So, grab a cup of coffee, sit back, and enjoy the game. And if you're feeling adventurous, take a flier on the under.

Upstairs is a smallish open plan kitchen/living room but with very high vaulted ceiling. The room is always very bright at any point of the day. Ignore the coffee table/lamps and chairs as this will go, but we just bought the ginger couch. Not a fan of the colour of the kitchen cabinets, considering painting or replacing their doors eventually.
Downstairs, it's very dark as it's a staggered hallway, with one window near the backdoor only. So front part of the hallway gets absolutely no light if the bedroom is closed. The front hallway also gives directly to the stairwell, with very high ceiling.
Overall, I want some colours in my house and like warm tones. My original plan for upstairs is the colour palette added to the last photo, but really unsure what paint colour would work. I guess a lighter version of the same tones? Maybe an accent wall? For downstairs and the stairwell I'm absolutely clueless. I'd almost want to embrace the dark completely but I guess we would have to do the same with the stairs, and it would become too contrasting when arriving upstairs.

Do NOT live near Centennial Park (West End side) – too many homeless people, especially at night, making it feel unsafe.

Condo Living Considerations:

Staffing & Construction Issues – Many condos are understaffed and poorly built. This may lead to frequent fire alarms. The walls may be super thin.

Elevator Problems – Some condos only allow elevator access from the garage, exposing you to bad air. Always ask about elevator locations before signing a lease!

High-Rise Apartments Are Better:

Better Services – Many offer free coffee, better elevators, and better gyms.

Roommate Option – If cost is a concern, split the rent with 1-2 roommates instead of settling in a studio or one-bedroom unit.

Lease Agreement Cautions:

Do NOT make a contract with a place that requires 60-Day Notice Requirements – Last-semester students are often too busy to remember, leading to extra fees. This is especially true for graduate students as the majority of graduate students are not sure when they will actually graduate. In the United States, we usually have to give a notice at least 30-days prior to your lease end date. Anything above 30 days could be seen as a trap to fool the tenants (especially international students) and get more money from their pockets.

Negotiate Early Termination Fees – It should be $500 max, NOT an entire month’s rent.

Research Before Signing:

Read Reviews on [Apartments.com](http://apartments.com/) & Google Maps – Check both the property and the management. Read from lowest ratings from highest ratings. Focus on reviews that were written by tenants that left the place so that they went through the whole process of making a contract and ending a contract.

Zillow.com is generally better than Apartments.com because it also shows the sale price and not just rent price.

Look for at least 4.3-star ratings – Anything lower means red flags!

Check the Management Company – If multiple buildings belong to the same company, read all their reviews.

Recommendations:

Parke West Apartments – One of the best visited!

Commuting Option – If you want to save money, live further away and drive to Vanderbilt.

Use Lemonade for Renter Insurance. The cancellation process is extremely easy.

Never use eRenterPlan for your Renter Insurance. The price is more expensive than Lemonade, and the cancellation process is complex. The consumer service is not good. The website is poorly designed.

Do not make a contract with unfurnished places unless their reviews are good. If you furnish your place, it will be harder for you to move out the place.

Follow these tips to find a safe, affordable, and well-managed place to live!",2,1747451985.0,Vanderbilt,0,0.75,False

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. The type of connection I want strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavor.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.**  I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1747451394.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

Just got back from an epic road trip and thought I’d share the experience here. If you’re planning something similar, hope this helps!

Hyderabad to Chennai:
Straightforward drive, mostly smooth highways. Started early to skip traffic in Hyd and cruised down NH44/NH16. Good road conditions, plenty of stops for food, fuel, and coffee.

Chennai to Munnar:
This stretch was stunning! Great roads till Dindigul, and then the drive through the hills started getting really scenic. Took a short break near Theni—great spot for some local tea and snacks. The ghat section towards Munnar is super green and refreshing (but go slow if you’re not used to hill roads).

Stay in Munnar:
We stayed at Bottlebrush - The Tea Side Stay—highly recommend! Super cozy place tucked in a tea estate. Gorgeous early mornings and peaceful evenings. Shoutout to Praful (host) and John (caretaker)—both made sure we had a comfortable and memorable stay.

Munnar to Chennai (return):
Took it slow, stopped in Madurai for food. Roads were great again. Wrapped up the trip back in Chennai.

This was one of the best trips I’ve taken—great mix of highway cruising and hill driving, plus some chill time in the hills.

Last month my company had major lay offs and my best friend coworker that sat like 2 rows away from me got let go. He wasn’t happy in the role and wanted to do an internal mobility. But he didn’t survive :(

It’s really horrible I miss him so much and I feel like a shell of myself. I’m shy and he helped connect me with people at the firm. Without him I feel incredibly lonely. We would walk to the train station after work all the time talking about our day. I would talk to him over teams at least once a day. Now I talk to little to no one at my company and most days I feel like crying walking into the office because I know he won’t be there for us to grab coffee or talk about our weekend. 
I never felt so alone in my life. My childhood best friend turned out to be a narcissist and our friendship ended badly. We were in a friend group too and they took her side so I lost that as well. The guy I was talking to for 2 months also lost his job and ghosted me.  

I really am losing hope, I hate reaching out to people but I feel so lonely and sad all the time. I’m hitting my cart practically everyday and dissociate most mornings. I don’t have an appetite and lost motivation to cook so I eat one meal a day. I don’t go to the gym anymore. It’s a mess, my life fucking sucks.

Been borderline depressed for a couple months and this coworker helped uplift me. Now that he’s gone I’ve been spiraling. I’m getting a bit scared of myself just because I know how good I am at masking my sadness. No one checks in on me because of it but I wish it were more obvious. My parents/friends/coworkers have no clue how depressed I’ve been.

We’d tap into every major area of life that women need to succeed, be healthy, and be truly happy.

Here’s what daily life would look like:
	•	Morning dance, fitness, strength training, and some HIIT to keep the body energized
	•	Balanced meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner plus personalized, tasty herbal remedies made just for you
	•	Getting at least 9 hours of solid sleep every night
	•	Learning stress management techniques to calm the mind and nervous system
	•	Practicing mental health care, emotional resilience, healthy relationships, and boundary-setting, with regular honest circle talks where we get real and support each other
	•	Daily reflection, meditation, gratitude, and connecting with nature or the universe to feed the soul
	•	Finding work-life harmony, making space for hustle and play, passion projects, and rest
	•	Building financial stability through shared expenses, brand deals, and creating content together
	•	A real sisterhood, leaning on each other, trading skills, co-creating, and growing

Work hard, play harder because we don’t do burnout here.

About an hour later I remembered that we could use the Ioniq 6 for electricity. Took me a bit to figure out (no WiFi of course) but then plugged a 50 ft extension cord into the outlet under the rear seats, plugged in the fridge, and voila!  At that point it was 62% charged. 

I stayed up for a bit to see how much power it was using. Not much!  Went to sleep and in the morning briefly swapped the coffee maker  in, made coffee, plugged the fridge back in & went to work in another car. After almost 24 hrs battery was down to 42% or so. 

So I figured I would try charging at a nearby Electrify America for the first time. Unplugged the extension cord and realized I’d left the air conditioning on in the car. I guess that’s why it had used so much battery life.  

Anyway, after 12 minutes at Electrify America I was back to 80%!  Drove home, plugged the extension cord back in, and made sure the air & lights were off.

And dad has never been alone with the baby. He takes the toddler to the park and the store but has never taken just the baby and definitely has never had both kids alone, even at home. I have gone out 3 times without the kids and each time he's needed to call in back up (either his mom or a friend) he knows I need a break-but just doesn't seem comfortable having both babies alone. 

I'm a stay at home mom, I'm alone with both boys every day-all day. He has his weekly boys night where he is kid free, he gets his hair cut when he wants, he does things outside of work and the house. He has two weekend get aways planned for this summer with his buddies. When I bring up going away for a girls weekend he gets realllly anxious and just tells me he doesn't know if the baby will be okay without me or he doesn't know how he would do it. And don't get me wrong I am greatful to beable to spend this time with these boys but I'm also struggling with post partum depression (medicated and doing better but some days are still hard). I feel drained all the time. I have no hobbies. I don't do anything. When I see my friends its with the kids, doing kid oriented activities. I go to play dates, story times, parks, indoor jungle gyms with BOTH kids and I guess I'm getting a little frustrated that I can't leave them with their dad without him getting anxious and telling me he can't do it. 

I do want to stress that he's not uninvolved, he plays with the boys, he cooks dinner most nights, he helps with dishes, he reads to the boys, does the toddlers bath time and bedtime routine. We all eat dinner together, and breakfast together on the weekends he's not hands off by any means. 

But I think lacks confidence and I don't know how to help. Should I gradually leave the house, go for a walk, then maybe go grab a coffee, should I try just sitting out in my car to be available if he needs me? Should I just pull the bandaid off and tell him to suck it up these are his kids too and he needs to just figure it out? Do I continue to schedule help for him when I want time by myself? 

Any advise would be great. And I'd love to hear if anyone else is in this type of situation. 

A few notes for context:

Our baby had a rough start, a nicu stay, and colic. He was a very unhappy baby. He didn't like anyone else holding him except me. But now that he's older he's a pretty happy baby, he has a schedule that keeps him happy, he's more social and doesn't freak when I walk away. I thought when he got more manageable I might get a break but I think he's gotten comfortable only being in charge of the toddler. ",2,1747450393.0,2under2,3,1.0,False

1koiuns,https://www.reddit.com/r/High_quality_apron/comments/1koiuns/high_appearance_level_strong_functionality_the_5/,"High appearance level + strong functionality: The ""5 Golden Rules for Choosing Modern Aprons""","When aprons have advanced from ""kitchen labor protection items"" to ""life ritual items"", consumers' expectations for them have long gone beyond merely ""blocking oil stains"".

A truly excellent modern apron needs to precisely match the scene requirements like a smart wearable device, and at the same time possess aesthetic value comparable to that of fashionable items.

The following is a gold selection guide summarized through professional evaluation and market research, helping you find the ""all-round partner"" in the kitchen battlefield.

**Rule One: Material Battle - From Basic Protection to Technological Empowerment**

 **The limitations of the ""pure cotton sentiment""**

Traditional pure cotton aprons have long dominated household kitchens due to their skin-friendly and breathable properties. However, actual measurement data shows that after cooking braised pork once, the oil stain penetration rate of pure cotton apron reaches 68%, and it is prone to deformation and hardening after repeated washing.

[braised pork](https://preview.redd.it/spyhus0z991f1.jpg?width=730&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa2980405ec798d2311f1c33beab3c3925258ce3)

**Advanced plan:**

 **Polyester-cotton blend + nano-coating:** Composite fabric, the surface layer adopts hydrophobic nano-technology. Soy sauce drops can be wiped clean with a paper towel within 5 seconds. The stain resistance is 70% higher than that of pure cotton, while retaining 35% of cotton fibers to ensure breathability.

The Shupo cotton independently developed by Kefei Company has excellent waterproof performance. It is not only aesthetically pleasing but also fully functional, making it truly perfect.

 

[Shupo cotton](https://preview.redd.it/tf28koi1a91f1.jpg?width=789&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e91ce9fcddb574790132f0aa37fc9e11b5abba9b)



[apron made by shupo cotton](https://preview.redd.it/x2ghileaa91f1.jpg?width=4090&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=007879a0263205f399d74aa7087b67a3d4ee751d)

**Food-grade silicone revolution:** Silicone aprons that have passed FDA food contact certification, can withstand high temperatures up to 260℃ and are machine washable and foldable. They are particularly suitable for high-temperature frying scenarios. Amazon reviews show that their service life is three times that of fabric aprons.

 **A new eco-friendly force:** Blending coffee grounds extract into yarn not only has antibacterial and deodorizing effects, but each apron is equivalent to recycling 30 cups of coffee grounds, making it a favorite among sustainable consumers in Europe and America.

**Rule Two: The Devil is in the details - Ergonomic design determines the frequency of use**

**Pocket Revolution**

After being tested by 100 users, it was found that for traditional flat pockets with a depth of less than 15cm, the probability of mobile phones slipping off is as high as 43%. The 3D pocket with three-dimensional cutting (it is recommended to choose the size of 16×28cm) has an internal zoning design that can accommodate:

Left: Smart phone (compatible with a 6.8-inch large screen)

On the right: Kitchen timer + temperature probe

Top magnetic strip: Secure recipe notes

Wearable system upgrade

Traditional neck straps have caused 83% of users to report ""shoulder soreness"". The German Red Dot Award-winning work ""Magnetic Apron"" adopts:

4cm widened memory foam shoulder straps: Distribute 60% of shoulder pressure

Rare earth magnetic buckle: Quick on and off in 0.3 seconds, 30% more efficient than tying straps

Waist smart adjuster: Achieve full coverage of the waist circumference from 56 to 130cm through the slider

**Rule Three: Scenario-based precise Strikes - Different battlefields require different equipment**

**Essential for baking Experts**

Length standard: A long apron (85-95cm) can fully cover the thighs to prevent flour and frosting from staining the home clothes.

Splash-proof front: The A-shaped front panel with A waterproof TPU coating is recommended by the British Baking Association. The 30° tilt design allows liquids to slide off automatically.

Special accessories: Anti-slip wrist straps to prevent the cuffs from sticking when kneading the dough.

Outdoor barbecue war God configuration

Safety reflective strip: 3M Scotchlite reflective material, visible from 30 meters away at night, reducing the risk of charcoal fire operations;

Tool hanging system: Military-grade nylon webbing + mountain climbing buckle, which can hang equipment such as meat tongs, oil bottles, flashlights, etc.

Rapid heat dissipation structure: The breathable mesh fabric under the armpits, combined with the ventilation duct design on the back, has been measured to lower the temperature by 4-6℃.",1,1747450368.0,High_quality_apron,0,1.0,False

1koiud5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShuumatsuNoValkyrie/comments/1koiud5/record_of_ragnarok_divine_intervention_chapter_11/,"Record of Ragnarok, Divine Intervention: Chapter 11, Cat and Mice","Chernobog chases after the Mona Lisa clones, desperate to find the real one as they continue to multiply like rabbits. The Mona Lisas running from the Death Deity to try and wear him out, but the Death Deity isn't that easy to tire out, as he begins to charge up an attack, as the Blade glowed purple, he launched a fiery human skull making a high pitched screaming noise that explodes on contact with multiple clones, destroying them for a while. This attack was known as...

**SPECTRAL SHOT.**

Chernobog: Just what in helheim is that woman's ability?...It's clone creation has no end...

Heimdall: AND THE CLONES KEEP COMING FOLKS! CHERNOBOG CAN'T KEEP KILLING THEM! IS THIS GONNA BE ANOTHER WIN TO HUMANITY?!

All the gods were worried, another win to humanity in a row? This early in the tournament? What would this say they were as beings supposed to be above their creations?...however, this wasn't shared among all, as suddenly, a god laughed very loudly.

???: Him?! Lose?! Ha! Imagine that! Say isn't that funny Hel?

The God responsible for the noise wore a black cloak with a skull to help hold it together. Underneath he wore a dark blue toga with leather sandals on his feet.

???: Quiet Thanatos, but...you're right, if anyone's gonna secure the god's win, it'll absolutely be that God...

The goddess who said that had a rather peculiar face, with 1 half showing a beautiful woman with blond hair and blue eyes, while the other showed a rotting corpse. She wore a hangerok with the skirt reaching to her knees.

The 2 gods, now revealed to be fellow Death Deities Thanatos and Hel, were watching the fight with the other pantheons deities of the end to support Thanatos.

???: Hush you two! We came here to watch Boggy fight! not so you can bicker!

The goddess in question wore a purple Kimono with red spider Lillies decorated around them, her Obi was blue and she carried a white wagasa with pink Sakura decorated onto it. Meanwhile, she wore Geta, which had a black toe thong.

Hel: Sorry Izanami...

Thanatos: My bad mom-IZANAMI! I MEANT IZANAMI!

Everyone turned to look at Thanatos, even the fighters.

Thanatos:...just ignore that! PLEASE!

Lisa clone?: Are...those your friends?

Chernobog: It's not your business to know, but I prefer the term, colleagues...I work with them, but I do not exactly consider them friends.

Lisa clone?: I see...well then, die!

The Lisa clone charges forward with a knife, but Chernobog throws another Spectral Shot at the Lisa clone, launching her away and destroying her.

Chernobog: Rather unfitting, seeing as I'm a Death Deity.

The Lisa clones suddenly revealed multiple fire arms and throwing weapons aimed towards the God, as one of the Lisas smirk.

Lisa clone?: Is that so? Well then, allow me to give you a fitting death!

The immortal opened fire, as Chernobog quickly spun his scythe, as wisps of souls formed from each spin, soon covering Chernobog into a giant orb, which hardened into a barrier.

Chernobog: **Soul** **Guard**!

The barrier withstood the onslaught as the army of immortal women continued to try and break through.

Chernobog: There's no use in trying to win Immortal, Death will come for you all.

Chernobog suddenly begins moving the sphere, as the Lisas begin to run away, but to no avail as they were crushed under the giant barrier.

Chernobog(POV): Still nothing, there has to be something that differentiates her...wait, think, did she have any sort of different item that the clones don't?...

Lisa clone?: You should pay more attention, especially in a fight.

Bullets suddenly broke through the ball of energy, which snapped Chernobog out of his train of thought.

Chernobog: Damn it...

Chernobog sees a group of Lisa clones running his way.

Chernobog sighs and slams his hand to the ground, as multiple skeletal hands grasp the legs of the Mona Lisas.

Chernobog: **Wave of the Dead.**

Chernobog then released another Spectral Shot at the Lisas, resulting in the same results.

(V.I.P Stands: Valkyries)

Aslaug watched as the fight ensued.

Aslaug: Woah...for someone with such a kind face, her ability is scary!...

Göll: Wait kind face?...what do you mean?!

**(Prior to Round 2: Lisa Del Giocondo's waiting room)**

The 2 Valkyries and Cain were seated at a fine dining table. The room of the woman behind Leonardo Da Vinci's greatest masterpiece looked similar to a house found in the renaissance. It's walls and furniture were all beautifully made.

Cain: Woah...how do you make these rooms?!

Göll: Ah, that's...actually I'm pretty sure we use magic. I don't know which one though.

Lisa: Sorry to keep you waiting, I've brought you all some coffee and cake.

Lisa sets down a tray of desserts and cappuccinos. The dessert tray carried many delicious Italian treats, such as mini tiramisus, tricolored cookies, crunchy biscottis, and many other delicious sweets.

Aslaug: Woah! These look good!

Cain smiled wide at Lisa's kind offer.

Cain: Did you make these yourself!?

Lisa: I did, it's the least I could offer.

Cain: Aww, Big Bro's so proud of you! Come here!

Cain pulls Lisa into a big bear hug. Lisa seemed quite uncomfortable, but understood why Cain seemed to be like this.

Lisa: Thank you...Cain, now please, enjoy.

The 2 Valkyries and Cain each grabbed a confection, as they all took a bite, they soon were met with the delicious taste of each treat.

Aslaug: You simply must give me the recipes! These would be great for reunions with the other Aunties!

Lisa smiles.

Lisa: I'll send you the recipes before the round.

When the face of Lisa was revealed, it was shown her face...was beautiful, she had soft eyes, and looked innocent.

**(Back to now)**

Göll: Wait, no! Her face wasn't like that! It was scary!

**(Prior to Round 2: Lisa Del Giocondo's Waiting room)**

The same scene took place, but when it got to the part where the Mona Lisa's face was revealed to look malicious, with sharp eyes and a smile that looks like there's a evil scheme behind it.

**(Back to now)**

Aslaug: Wait what do you mean?! How can her face be scary?!

Göll: How can her face look kind?!

Jack: Hm...I think I got an idea of what's happening.

Göll+Aslaug: What?

Jack: You see, I was introduced to a certain theory, it involved a cat, a box, a flask of poison, something that breaks glass like a hammer, and a Geiger counter. If the Geiger counter detects radioactivity, the hammer breaks the flask, and the cat dies, but if it doesn't, the cat lives. Making the cat both alive and dead.

Aslaug: What kind of Cruel experiment is that?!

Göll: Wait, you mean Schrödinger's cat?

Aslaug: What?

Hlokk: It's a thought experiment, essentially, it's saying the cat's a paradox, which is what can best describe this woman.

Jack: It's possible since there's not much other idea for what could be causing this differing view unless you two have different opinions of what looks kind and what doesn't.

Aslaug: That...actually makes sense!

Jack: However, it's only a possibility, we can't be sure unless there's proof.

**(In the stands)**

A lone man stood as the fight continued, he had a gray beard and wore a dark gray beret, his robes orange covered by a blue jacket that reached down to his feet which had brown shoes. This was the man Leonardo Da Vinci.

Leonardo Da Vinci(Italian, Famed Artist)

Leonardo: You never change, do you Lisa...ah well, can't say I'm surprised...she was like this when we met too.

1koit54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Interstitialcystitis/comments/1koit54/does_this_sound_like_ic_or_something_else/,Does this sound like IC or something else?,"26F. I have strong suspicion that I have IC. 
For 7 months or so I’ve had the below symptoms with no infection. 
- Pelvic pain with or without holding urine but more so when holding urine 
- Pain in the vagina/vulva/urethra
- Urgency/Frequency without emptying much 
- Needing to pee so many times a day/night 

The symptoms had only disappeared once for a couple weeks then returned. I suspect it has ‘triggers’ because when it disappeared i wasn’t drinking coffee or milk very often until it returned. Which makes me lean more toward IC. I also have kidney disease so my nephrologist referred me to a urologist recently. 
The last few days I’ve had new symptoms associated with it though: 
- Stinging/uncomfortability when peeing. 
- Lower back pain
- Constant pelvic pain
- Pain that has spreads more upwards to cover my whole lower stomach and pelvis rather then just the pelvic region 
- Pain in 1 area of my right side of pelvis, inside of hip(close to hip bone). 

I went to the GP who prescribed me antibiotics without doing a dipstick due to other medical conditions (see below) that would give a confusing result. 
I’m on my last day of antibiotics and i don’t feel any different.. When i’ve taken antibiotics in the past it has eased the symptoms at least short term but this time i don’t feel any different. 

TW‼️Contains text about miscarriage. 

I had a recent miscarriage and had to use MISO pill and then a d&c (last friday) so I still have pregnancy hormones in my system and I am also extremely constipated which I’m wondering is contributing to the extensive pain then usual. 
Can anyone relate to this? It’s been so long dealing with this issue without seeing anyone and it SUCKS. 
Does it sound like IC? Or something else?

1koinw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1koinw7/aio_girlfriend_of_3_months_wants_to_scuba_dive/,AIO: Girlfriend of 3 months wants to Scuba dive weekly one-on-one with an instructor she’s previously kissed whilst drunk,"So, I’ve (40m) been dating Jessica (30f) for 3 months now. After my divorce 1.5 years ago I was miserable for over a year, bordering on depression. Then she came into my life, everything has been a wonderful ray of sunshine since then. She’s kind, intelligent, beautiful, and we just have the most amazing days together. It’s only been 3 months, but because both of us have flexible jobs and schedules, we spend almost every day together and the relationship has really blossomed much faster than 3 months would tend to indicate.

She’s very into Scuba, but I know she hasn’t been doing it at all on the island we live on because she doesn’t really like the coaches of the schools here, and she doesn’t have her own gear/boat, so she would need to use them to dive with. She’s very excited that her old coach is returning after an absence on the island after some time away.

I don't know what prompted me to ask, but I just blurted out: ""Hey was there ever anything between you and Albert (the coach)?"" And she replied, ""We had a drunk kiss. One time, and never again."" I wasn't really sure how to react. I replied that I appreciated her telling me the truth, but I would have preferred not having to ask a direct question. This relates to her other instructor Bob, who she had told me she had a physical relationship. She told me unsolicited. Pretty soon after we started dating, she told me she had a scuba retreat on another island. No big deal. Once we dated a bit more and we felt ""exclusive"" she told me that she had had a sexual relationship with the instructor from the retreat, that was basically agreed between the two of them that since she was only on the island for the retreat, it would just be for the time she was there and nothing more. She wanted me to know before she went away for the retreat (obviously she had booked the retreat before we even met). He has a serious girlfriend now, and she's seeing me and they had both spoken and it was clear there would be nothing going on. Through mutual friends, I know this part is all true, Bob does have a new girlfriend and she would be at the retreat as well. I felt a bit uneasy, but I trusted her, and I didn't want to be controlling. Plus, she had this fling way before we even met, and she had this retreat planned before we ever went out on a date.

Anyway, she plans to freedive with Albert (the instructor coming back to the island) once a week, to get her practice in. I felt really uneasy about it the whole afternoon, especially since I felt like this time she didn't volunteer that they had kissed once, I actually asked. And I questioned why have I never asked about any other guy before, but I asked about this one? Is it possibly because of the way she talks about him? Rather than let it fester, I brought up my discomfort with her this evening. She thought for a second and acknowledged my feelings and made me feel validated in bringing it up. She also said that ""can we talk about this more in a couple of days, so I can think on it?” Because I get what you're saying, but if I don't dive with him, it means I basically don't dive on the island."" I also replied that I didn't bring it up to tell her not to go with him, I just wanted her to hear my feelings and validate them which she did. That I understand that diving one-on-one is also something safety critical and you need to be able to trust the person you are diving with.

But it’s been festering on my mind more and more since then. This is literally the third time something similar has happened in three months. The first month, was the dive retreat with the guy she had slept with. Then last month her ex-boyfriend came back to the island, and she got a coffee with him (after telling him about me, and that there was no chance anything was going to happen with them). Now she wants to dive weekly with a guy that’s kissed before. Everyone has a past and mine is probably much sketchier than hers. The issue is that her past keeps rearing its head into our present.

I do trust her and I’m not a jealous guy at all. I’ve always believed that if you have to worry and keep tabs on your partner, and the only thing that would stop them from cheating is you doing that, then that’s not a real relationship anyway. I also don’t want to control her and stop her from doing things she enjoys. But I don’t love the fact I had to flat out ask if anything had happened between them before, or it seems she wouldn’t have even told me about it.

I also feel that if the positions were reversed, I would understand better about why she wouldn’t want me to be seeing someone weekly (one-on-one) that I had kissed before. And I wouldn’t do it to her. She seems to see things differently though, in that it was a stupid kiss in the past that meant nothing, and shouldn’t affect what she does now in the present and future.

I don’t feel comfortable with this arrangement where she would be seeing this guy weekly. In fact I feel sick just thinking about it. But I also don’t want to control what she does. If the positions were reversed, I would probably volunteer not to do it. But if the positions were reversed and she gave me an ultimatum on it, I would probably end the relationship because I hate ultimatums.

Am I overreacting in this situation and the past should be the past and what she did whilst single before she met me shouldn’t matter? Or is this just a normal reaction? She’s an amazing girlfriend, and I never thought I had the right to be this happy again in my life. Is it worth possibly throwing it all away by insisting that she doesn’t dive with this guy, if she wants to continue a relationship with me?

TLDR: having an amazing relationship with an amazing woman. Genuinely see a life in the future for us. But her past whilst single, keeps showing up in our present and now she wants to scuba dive weekly (which could be one-on-one) with her scuba instructor who she has previously kissed before.",1,1747449728.0,AmIOverreacting,5,1.0,False

So I would like some advice especially from women. My dating game is really bad. Like I have been in relationships but all of them went from being friends to then getting closer. I am not really good at flirting etc.

There's this girl at my work. I have been noticing her for sometime. More than a couple days back I introduced myself and then after that for 2 days have been going on small walks with her for breaks.

On both the days the conversation was friendly. It wasn't flirty. I am not sure if I should have taken it in that direction. Anyways I am not that smooth with flirting. I did compliment her nails which are super cute ngl and also her dressing sense. It's cute.

I don't really know how to proceed from here. We did follow each other on instagram. Sometimes there have been glances being passed, smiles etc etc.

I am nervous. It's after a 2 year span I have a crush on someone. Idk what to do.

What I am thinking? - I was thinking of pinging her on instagram. Seeing if she replies and maybe do some small talk. If that works maybe ask her out for a coffee or something.

I don't know what to do. A part of me says be you. If it's meant to be it'll. Although one advice I want to know. People usually say don't compliment girls on their apperance in the begining. Just wanted to know how true this is. It's just that I have never seen someone as cute as her to the extent that when she walked into the hall that day my mind could only process one thing ""You're fucked!"".

The smoke made my throat itch and stung my nose and eyes but I persisted.  I didn’t love it but it wasn’t too unpleasant.  It gave me something to do with my hands and kept my mind off whatever I was feeling.  Mom’s gonna kill me if she sees me like this, but dad smokes a lot so maybe she'll assume it’s him that she smells.  Maybe growing up with it is why I can tolerate it.  It smells sickly but also warm, nutty, and strangely soothing. I worry about dad.  He smokes too much and works too hard.  On the rare occasion we’re home at the same time he has a cigarette in his mouth.  Mom tells him to smoke outside but he doesn’t care.  At least he quit smoking in the living room and stays in his bedroom.  Will I end up like him?  What must his lungs look like?  I should try to quit when I graduate.

Shit I’m overthinking again.



Thick smoke stings my eyes

While my loud mind longs for rest,

And my lungs for peace.

\-Ren



Some ash fell on my neck and burned me.  I flinched and saw bits of ash down the front of my blouse.  My shirt will definitely reek now.  Maybe I’ll ask to stay the night just to be safe.  I already know Sonya’s dad won’t mind.  He lets her do whatever she wants.  And even if he did mind I hardly even see him whenever I visit.  It’s a weeknight so it’ll be a hard sell for my mom.  I guess I can put it off until the sun sets and tell her I lost track of time and don’t wanna walk in the dark.  What if she offers to drive me?  Quite the conundrum.



“Rena, you’re doing it again.”



I blinked and turned my head to face Sonya lying down right next to me.  “What do you mean?”



“You shouldn’t zone out with a smoke in your hand,” she said as she passed me an ashtray.  The ceramic tray was shaped like a turtle missing its shell.  Every time I saw it I thought how strange it was for something so cute to be an accessory to our vices.  I crushed the cigarette into the tray and she closed the lid, returning his shell.  “Are you tired? Did you sleep well?”



I couldn’t tell if she was concerned for me or her bedsheets.  She spoke with basically no inflection in her voice so a lot of people had a hard time reading her and she often came across as rude or uncaring.  I don’t know how she manages to work in the service industry.



""I’m ok, just a lot on my mind.”

“I thought midterms are over for you.”

“They are.”

“Did you do bad?”

“No.”

“What’s to be worried about?”

“Nothing.  Or maybe everything I don’t know.  My thoughts are just bouncing around”

“Overactive mind is a symptom of depression.”

“Everything’s a symptom of everything.”



Sonya let out a single breathy grunt.  That’s the closest to a laugh I could ever get out of her.  I don’t think I’m depressed, but she was right.  I had no reason to be anxious.  I did fine on all my midterms, winter break is around the corner, and yet I couldn't shake this aching in the pit of my stomach.



“How did you do on your midterms?”  I knew she hated being asked about her grades, and liked small talk even less, but I had to try focusing on one thing.  She didn’t get mad or anything but I already knew what she was going to say.  “It’s over.  Why do you ask? What does it matter?  No, it’s ok.  Same as it ever was.”  I’ve seen her grades.  She’s not a bad student, I just wish she cared more.



“Same as it ever was.”

“What’s that even supposed to mean?”

“You already know.”

“It doesn’t make sense as an answer”

“It makes enough sense.”

“Then explain how it does.”

“No.”

“Rude.”



Sonya might be the most Zen person I know, without her even trying.  She lived in the moment, didn’t like making plans, and never complained.  How can anyone be content with everything?  I couldn’t help but envy her, but I knew this was a dangerous mindset.



“Have you decided on a college?”

“Nope.”

“You’re running out of time.  It’d be cool if we could go to the same college and be roommates.”



She didn’t answer.  She just reached for the pack in between us and lit another cigarette for herself.  I actually was beginning to worry.  It’s December, she graduates in a little less than six months.  She never seemed to particularly like serving coffee, but didn’t seem to have any real aspirations.  I’ve known her since 2nd grade and I still didn’t know of any of her goals in life.  Could working up the ranks in a coffee shop be it?  She’s pretty smart; she'd probably be a fine manager or even owner.



“Sony.”

“Hm.”

“Would you make me some coffee?

“You hate coffee.”

“Well can you make something even I would like?”

“Where’s this coming from?”

“I’ll visit your work and then you’ll have to make me coffee.”

“Please don’t.”

“Por que?”

“I want my personal life and my professional life to stay separate.”

“I guess that’s fair”



There was a long silence.  I wouldn’t say Sonya is a bad host but there usually isn’t much to talk about.  One of few words, always to the point.  Her love language was being physically present.  Whenever she invited me over I always came, even though we usually just sat in silence while we smoked, read, or studied.  I wish she had a tv.  ",1,1747449237.0,writingcritiques,0,1.0,False

------------

Many people want to lose weight. I see some take pre-workout pills. But do these pills really help? Some studies show that about 15% of adults in the US use supplements for weight loss. I want to know if pre-workout is useful.

This writing explains how pre-workout *might* help you lose weight. I will talk about how it works. I will also talk about what things are inside. Pre-workout is not magic. You must still eat good food and do exercise. If not, you may not lose weight. This paper tells you what to look for so it can help. I hope to make it easy for everyone to understand. This is not medical advice. Consult a doctor.

How Pre-Workout *Might* Support Weight Loss Efforts
---------------------------------------------------

Pre-workout drinks can help you work out harder. I see people use these to try to lose weight. But how does this work? Here are the ways pre-workout can help.

First, I noticed it gives you more power. When you have more power, you can lift more weight. You can do more exercise. More exercise burns more calories. Second, the pills make you want to move. When you want to move, you exercise. You do not stay on your sofa all day. Third, these pills *might* make your body burn more fat. This is because of some things inside the pill. But this change might be small. It might not help much.

Remember, the main thing for losing weight is eating less food. You must eat fewer calories than you use. I think this is the important part. I want people to learn and see clearly.

Key Ingredients Often Found in Pre-Workouts for Weight Loss
-----------------------------------------------------------

I look at pre-workout labels to see what is inside. Some things can help with exercise or losing weight. Let me tell you about them.

### Common Stimulants (e.g., Caffeine)

Caffeine is a big one. I use it when I feel sleepy to study for exams. It gives power and wakes you up. It can also make your body burn more calories. But be careful! Too much caffeine is not good. Know how much you can take. Do not take too much. Every person is different.

### Other Potentially Relevant Ingredients (e.g., L-Carnitine, Green Tea Extract)

Some pre-workouts have L-Carnitine. The idea is this helps move fat in your body to be burned. Green tea extract is also common. People think this can help your body, too. But remember! These things in pre-workout may not make a big change. More studies are needed to see how they can help. I like learning the facts.

Choosing the Right Pre-Workout for Your Weight Loss Goals
---------------------------------------------------------

To choose the right pre-workout, first, read what is inside. See what matches your goals.

### Assessing Your Sensitivity to Stimulants

How does your body feel when you drink coffee? If coffee makes you shake, maybe you should not take too much pre-workout. Find one with less caffeine. I learn by watching my body. If it feels bad, stop. Some pre-workouts do not have caffeine. These are called ""stim-free."" If caffeine bothers you, try these.

### Looking for Transparent Ingredient Lists

Some companies hide how much of each thing is inside. They use something called a ""proprietary blend."" I do not like this. You cannot know how much you are getting. Pick the pre-workout that tells you clearly what is inside. Then, you can decide if it is good for you.

How to Use Pre-Workout Effectively for Weight Loss
--------------------------------------------------

Here is how I think you should use pre-workout to help lose weight.

Take pre-workout before you exercise. Thirty minutes is a good time. Do not take too much. Read the instructions. Start with a small amount. See how it makes you feel. It is good to drink water when you take pre-workout.

Remember, pre-workout is not a replacement for eating good food. It is also not a replacement for exercise. It is only a tool to help you. I always remember this.

Also, do not take pre-workout every day. Your body can get used to it. It will not work as well. Take breaks sometimes. I always listen to my body.

Potential Side Effects and Considerations
-----------------------------------------

Pre-workout can have side effects. I tell you what they are.

### Common Side Effects (e.g., jitters, crash, digestive issues)

Sometimes, pre-workout makes you feel shaky. This is because of the caffeine. Sometimes, you might feel very tired after the pre-workout wears off. Some people have tummy problems. If you have these problems, stop taking the pre-workout.

### Who Should Consult a Doctor Before Use

If you have heart problems, talk to a doctor. If you get anxious easily, talk to a doctor. If you take medicine, talk to a doctor. If you are pregnant, do not take pre-workout. If you are feeding a baby, do not take pre-workout. I always ask my doctor before trying new things. This is important.

The Importance of Diet and Exercise (Beyond Supplements)
--------------------------------------------------------

I want you to know this clearly: Pre-workout is not the main thing for losing weight.

The main thing is eating right. You must eat fewer calories than you use. The main thing is also doing exercise. You must move your body.

Pre-workout can help you with your exercise. But it will not help if you eat too much food. It will not help if you do not exercise. I remember this, and you should too. Supplements are not magic. I see people think they can eat anything if they take a pill. This is not true.

Conclusion
----------

Pre-workout *might* help you lose weight. It can give you power to exercise. It can make you want to move. It *might* make your body burn more calories. But remember the most important things.

You must eat good food. You must do exercise. Pre-workout is just a tool. Choose wisely. Use it carefully. Talk to a doctor or a food expert.

Pre-workout can be one small part of losing weight. It is not the whole thing. I hope this helps you understand.
