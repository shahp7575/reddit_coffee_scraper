1lfkqym,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1lfkqym/i_want_to_abandon_my_narcissistic_parents_yet/,"I want to abandon my narcissistic parents, yet they’ve been on their best behavior recently.","I’m a 24-year-old guy who’s been struggling with the long-lasting effects of having narcissistic parents. Ever since I was very young, I’ve dealt with the typical issues of abused children: low self-esteem, a compulsive need to please everyone, playing the peacekeeper, and believing that love has to be earned by doing what I’m ""supposed"" to do—like getting good grades. I’ve felt ashamed every time my parents embarrassed me, endured constant denigrating comments, and thought of them as gods to whom I didn’t deserve anything.

I’ve often felt numb, like I don’t really know what’s happening to me or how to fix it. But I do have one big breakthrough story. When I was 22, I took a trip with some colleagues, and one of them offered us mushrooms. I’m not usually into drugs—the only other things I consume are coffee and, once every three months or so, alcohol (which I actually find pretty unpleasant). But I had been considering mushrooms as an alternative.

That trip was one of the best experiences of my life—followed by one of the scariest. At a certain point, my demons started to appear: worries about what others think of me, why I’m so depressed every day, and so on. Yet in the final stages of the trip, it felt like everything just clicked. My brain presented those problems in a terrifying way, then miraculously ""solved"" them by revealing who I really was.

After that trip, things went smoothly. It felt like a higher power was showing me exactly what I needed every single day. I was given tools to heal trauma—learning to let go—tools to become who I truly am, and to understand the human experience. A lot has happened since then, and while it’s true that I’ve healed many of my issues, I know I’ve only scratched the surface.

Four days ago, a video from the YouTube channel @jerrywise (an expert in narcissistic and dysfunctional family dynamics) popped up in my feed. Every video I watched about narcissistic parents perfectly described my relationship with mine. That’s when I realized the core of my problems: the insane, psychopathic, narcissistic way my parents raised me. It feels like there’s a huge ball of black, negative energy in my chest.

I now genuinely hate them. They’ve gaslighted me, blamed me for everything bad, called me a piece of shit daily, given me unwanted gifts only to remind me how much they “gave” and how I “don’t deserve it,” and beaten or insulted me whenever I didn’t fit their script. I studied software engineering only to meet their expectations, even though I’ve always wanted to be a biologist or psychologist—my father insisted I be an engineer. Once again, I betrayed myself just to earn the love of a psycho.

I’m about to start working and earning my own money so I can finally leave this career path I hate. The problem is, I want to leave them too—but I feel guilty about it, of course. Lately they’ve been treating me better, but I know it’s because I’m becoming more independent. My father’s kind words feel fake, like when he asked about my studies or job, or when he said, just two days ago, that children are an ""investment."" For God’s sake, I can’t see people I love—like my grandmother or my little cousin, who’s being raised by another narcissist—as investments. I love them unconditionally, and I know that if my loved ones left me, I’d be sad but wouldn’t make them feel guilty.

I know this is a huge text, but I just need to talk about this with someone and hear opinions from people who’ve been through the same. When I say I hate my parents, people look at me in disbelief, and I feel so alone.

1lfknck,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/s/9cIbDmhMQk,Pt. 2. Chances of Breaking in as a Ukrainian Refugee in London,"Hi everyone!

This post is both an update and a thank-you message to everyone who shared suggestions and wishes in response to my previous post a few months ago (you can read it using the link). For those who don’t know – I’m a Ukrainian finance student. A few weeks ago, I relocated to London and was looking for an internship here.

After nearly 2,5 months of searching, I’ve received an offer for a 4-month paid internship at a large international financial organization.

I’m genuinely excited about this opportunity – it’s probably the best outcome I could have imagined. In six weeks, I’ll be joining the banking portfolio team as a data, analytics & strategy intern at EBRD.

I’ll be working at a development bank that invests in many emerging markets, including Ukraine. This is one of the best jobs that can provide a sense of emotional fulfillment for me, considering its real impact and meaningfulness. On top of that, the role and responsibilities are basically the ones I was looking for.

The interview for the role was the best I’ve experienced so far as I answered perhaps 80%+ of the technical questions (and there were many of them). I really liked the interviewers, and I feel like I’ll be a great addition to the team, given my background and personality. The process was a bit long (a technical assessment and two interviews), but, as I understand, that’s pretty standard for large cities and large financial institutions. All in all, it took more than a month (closer to 1.5 months) from the moment I applied to receiving the final offer. Finally, I’ve accepted it yesterday.

I’m very grateful to everyone who supported me and shared kind words. I truly believe this internship will be one of the most life-changing moments for me, and I’m very excited about it.

To everyone who is looking for a job – believe in yourself and keep pushing forward! As one famous quote says: “Never bet against the person who just keeps showing up.”

Much love to you all!

P.S. If anyone would like to meet for a cup of tea or coffee in London – I’d love that! I’m new to the city and genuinely looking to make friends here, so please feel free to reach out.",2,1750363630.0,FinancialCareers,0,1.0,False

No more coffee before bed for me.,"I had a dream where I was changing jobs and got employed by a pretty shady company. I had to go to a deserted island to teach English to cat creatures with the life expectancy and language skills of a human child. The creatures were anatomically the same as cats with human eyes and the ability to speak like a human. The island was pretty stereotypical for an island but had stuff like a McDonalds on it. I met up with a bunch of co-teachers and we played games with the cat creatures and hung out on the island.

I didn't have any ""students"" because I'm new but I met this cat kid creature that another teacher has been teaching for the past 3 years and he was pretty funny yet naughty but with amazing English skills and I end up looking after him for a while. My colleague talks about him with a lot of pride. He is around 5 years old but looks like a kitten. He falls asleep in my jacket on the beach and I fall asleep too. It’s now time to go home so I'm woken up and I'm invited into one of the teacher’s cars to go home. I am still groggy from sleeping on the beach so I go to sleep again in the back seat of the car. I don't know how we leave the island but we end up on a main road in the city.

When I wake up, I found that I had accidently brought that cat creature with me who freaks out when he realizes he’s off the island and jumps out of the open car window. We pull over in the car. The creature is on the floor beady eyed and turning green with a look of horror on it’s face. It looks like an abomination. It won’t speak despite it talking so much on the island. It’s teacher tries to pick it up and make it walk on four legs but it’s hind legs are clearly broken. It’s teacher is distraught and won’t talk to me. I suggest we put it out of it’s misery. I hand her a rock but she can’t do it. She gives me the rock and I hit it hard in the head killing it. I tell her we should go back to the car but another teacher in the car takes my arm and says “leave her”.

I get back into the car and say that I’m sorry and I didn’t know. She says “I’m sorry too, I should have checked.” We drive for hours and hours. We occasionally stop to pick people up. I don’t know where we are going. All I feel is the shame for what I have done. We keep driving. I don't know where my home is. I don't know where I should get off. I don't even panic because I know I deserve what's coming.

Like I was cutting off a part of myself I wasn’t ready to live without.
I kept replaying the good moments, wondering if I gave up too soon… if maybe love just needed more time.

But here’s what no one tells you:
Sometimes, peace shows up quietly — weeks later — in the middle of doing something ordinary.

Like making coffee without waiting for their text.
Or laughing without guilt.
Or waking up and realizing… you’re not surviving anymore. You’re just living.

Letting go didn’t fix everything overnight.
But it made space for me — the version I lost while trying to hold on to someone who was never really holding back.

The peace didn’t come all at once.
It came in pieces.

But when it did… it felt like finally exhaling.

1lfkins,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lfkins,[Review] Dunbarton Tobacco & Trust ‘Muestra de Saka Exclusivo’,"Decided to break out one of the big boys today! This medium-full body smoke is sure to please in every single category a cigar could offer. Impeccable construction, great burn, and dialed-in on the draw: starts out a little tight but really opens up as you go along.

The first 1/3 of this cigar is exceptional. Fresh cream, milk chocolate, cassia bark, and pecan pie. I also get a little dried dark fruit and cedar on the finish. The retrhohale brings notes of white pepper and orange zest. Smoking very medium bodied right here.

The second third sees the body pump up to medium-full and also sees a decrease of creaminess. Milk chocolate shifts to mocha with some additional coffee notes. Still some dark fruit, but the main additions are mineral-rich earth and much larger notes of cedar that exist outside of the finish. Richer finish and retrohale of black pepper, white pepper, and aged orange peel (lil funkier than fresh peel). I also get toasty Ritz Crackers on the tail-end of the finish. 

The last third loses almost all cream and sweetness, leaning heavy into notes of cedar, earth, and black pepper. A nutty flavor takes over the finish and the retrohale is much the same, just maybe a little more spicy. Still medium-full bodied.

Overall, these are some of my favorite sticks for a reason. The beautiful nature of the construction and the nuance of the flavor really make this one a really special smoke to break out on occasion. Worth the $20 retail, but you can get em closer to $15 on Cigar Page. Worth every penny.

It’s a different way to rate restaurants. No stars, no reviews — just two places shown side by side, and you vote for the one you prefer. That’s it.

Pike Place Fish Market chowder or Taylor Shellfish oysters?  
Pok Pok or Nong’s Khao Man Gai?  
Stumptown Coffee Roasters or Heart Coffee Roastery?  
You decide.

The more people vote, the more we uncover what Pacific Northwesterners actually love — not just what gets featured in travel magazines or Instagram reels. Whether it’s a food truck by the waterfront in Tacoma, a BBQ joint in Portland’s Alberta district, or a tucked-away granola bar in Bellingham, your vote brings those local gems to light.

We’re still building out the map, so if your go-to pho alley in Vancouver BC (we’re including cross-border places locals frequent), or that secret pie window in Eugene isn’t listed yet, flag it in the app. We’re updating constantly.

1lfkei5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lfkei5/i_just_moved_into_my_new_apartment_and_i_think_i/,"I just moved into my new apartment, and i think i need to leave.","I just moved into a new apartment building and already I’m starting to regret my decision. I would have to say I didn’t choose to move, but I had no choice too, my parents were selling their house, and if they could with my ass in it. I had to pack what I had and find a place quickly, and it surprised me how fast it was when I found an apartment building leasing. The building had to be built back in the 1800’s, it was old and felt a little Victorian mixed into it. there are two lions in the front that guarded the doors, the building is in the middle of the busy city. These last three weeks I’ve been here, I feel like I should commit myself to the looney bin but decided for another outlet.

I do have a full-time job that keeps me busy, but when my shift ends, I regret going home afterwards. Its not that the neighbors are bad, or the landlord, all are great, sort of. Except for the guy above me. but to be honest, getting it out by telling my stories is better than any therapy session that I’ve ever had. right now, I’m currently hiding in my secret closet. My butt is falling asleep, and my stomach is growling, I haven’t eaten in two days, probably how long I’ve been in here.

My name is Willow. I’m a college dropout, I was majoring in graphic design, and I almost graduated last summer but I had a really bad break up and I dropped out of school and moved back in with my parents with a ten-thousand-dollar debt superglued to my butt and nowhere else to go. three weeks ago, my wonderful parents informed me they were downsizing and moving to Florida to retire, and that they were selling the house I grew up in. My parents didn’t really give me a head’s up, sadly enough my younger brother had texted me about how psyched he was that our parents were retiring and selling the dumpster-fire I liked to call home. Thanks, mom, dad. That’s how I found out I had to find a place quickly.

I’ve lived in this rainy city all my life, all the buildings are older then our grandparents, most were factories and other industrial places before the economy growth and realtor’s got a hold of the property and had done reconstruction on a lot of properties they renovated them into apartments or town homes to sparse up the city historic land and exploit the buildings unique beauty. But I had lived up in the suburbs with my parents until I was eighteen and came back dumped and a college drop out at the age of twenty-four. Everyone you meet on the street is either trying to sell you the latest drug or get you to join a cult down in their mom’s basement. I usually tend to stay to myself; I hate people most days anyway.

You’re probably wondering about my building, I had been searching ad after ad until it came up, it seemed perfect. The rent was in my range, I thought it had to be too good to be true. But I put in an application for it and the next thing I knew I got a tour of my new apartment and paid the rent and deposit in the same day. it’s a comfy one-bedroom apartment with everything I ever wanted, including the utilities in the rent. things seemed to be okay that is until every night I could hear it. it keeps me up most nights, and I am too much of a coward to check. I live on the fourth floor, and my side of the building don’t have the emergency stairs outside. So, when I say, every night I hear it. There’s this small tapping on my bedroom window. Its so light, as if someone is being kind while trying to wake me up. There are usually three taps then it stops, thirty minutes later the taps begin again. At first, I thought it was the branches of the trees out front, but when I realize there is no trees out front, something was off. Again, I have not looked, I have curtains closed all the time, and I am far to afraid to see what is on the other side of the glass. I am that little girl that hides under the bed and is far too afraid to find that monster. I’ve mentioned this tapping to the property owner who just tells me it’s the wind, my neighbors look at me like I need to be committed, they’d deemed me that neighbor. What I’m trying to illustrate is that since I’ve been living here alone without friends or even my family, that paranoia side of my brain takes the wheel, and I’ve started to see the hallucinations again. I’m sure its stress.

But all that aside, and the tapping, there are weird things that I’ve noticed, unwritten rules of the apartment building. You’d think they’d advertise the building might be haunted, I swear, it always feels like I’m being watched, and I swear up and down the hallways like to change on their own.

Like for example. Last week some asshole kid had pushed all the buttons on the elevator before getting off at the lobby with his mom. He stuck his tongue out at me then his birdie as they made their way out the door. I didn’t say everyone was friendly. Usually the janitor/maintenance guy could fix this issue, but he was nowhere around, and I really didn’t want to wait in the lobby for another elevator, besides the manager at the front desk really creeps me out. I took my chances. Okay for those who don’t know, the janitor/maintenance guy, Robert (or Robby), warns all new tenants to never ride the elevator up or down when all buttons are pushed, in his words exactly it will transport you to the nether world, and there is literally no way out other than being eaten by some time monster. I wasn’t listening to the last part when he warned me. so, I shrugged and stood in the middle of the elevator, and as per usual the doors opened at each floor that is until it got to my floor. I noticed something different, the hallway was a different color. My hallway is a puke green, this one was red. I looked at the buttons and sure enough it said I was on the right floor. I just had a bad feeling, so I pushed the closed-door button.

Then the elevator climbed to each floor, each floor got weirder, the floors started to look dank, dirty, abandoned. Torn wallpaper and carpet that looked like it aged and torn as if it had been uninhabited for years. At one point when the doors opened to the thirteenth floor which I didn’t know there was one, I swear I heard a woman screaming for help. but I kept my feet planted in that elevator, I was in nope territory. Thinking that Robby was right after all, but when the elevator hit the top floor on the fifteen floor, the elevator didn’t move it stayed put. slowly I stuck my head out, the floor looked normal-ish. The floor was green and smelt like moldy feet and weed in the mix. It was giving me a headache.

But that wasn’t what scared me, until I saw it, a huge black furry monster at the end of the hallway, it looked more like someone had made a huge Furbee (for those who don’t know what that was, I envy you). Its human like eyes glowered at me as it snarled, its body was less plump like a Furbee but was muscular and wielding an axe. It started to run down the hall towards the elevator, I tried pushing the elevator button to close the doors, but it refused to close the damn door. I pushed it again, and again. panic settling in. randomly I pushed all the buttons and just as the Furbee monster got to the elevator doors swinging its axe the elevator doors closed and I started to descend. I heard its howling anger from above. And I had never felt so relieved in my entire life for elevator buttons.

Another time, just this last Wednesday, six people ended up in the hospital, they had all been found at the end of the staircase that leads up to the floors. The police say that the stairs are unsafe, and that these people are tripping on possible loose floorboards. I know for a fact that isn’t the case. Sure, the staircase is a bit of an eyesore, I believe it’s the original design of this building, and I’ve climbed those stairs when I’m not in the mood to play what if with the elevator. But I actually saw it happen, the stairs itself looked like they were breathing, their were pulsing and one of the neighbors apparently didn’t see it and started to ascend, and suddenly I heard a groaning noise and all the stairs pulled inward and the stairs became an instant slide. The woman stumbled back and slid down and slammed hard in the lobby floor (the floors are made of that fake marble crap) butt first and she screamed in agonizing pain. then the stairs all went back to normal, Robby and the front desk manager came running to us, looking at me expectantly. All I could tell them was that she fell, the ambulance arrived, and I overheard the EMT telling the front desk manager that it looked like she might have a broken tailbone or hip. I wasn’t sure if anyone else heard it, but I heard the cackling coming from nowhere, and yet I suspected the building itself was laughing.

So, there is that to worry about. This building is interesting, as I said. I am a bit worried about those who live here including myself. so, remember that elevator rule? Well, there is plenty of unwritten rules I liked to call Robby’s warnings, or Robby rules to follow by. Here are few that Robby Rules, he’s told me to follow.

1.	⁠When the power goes out at random at night because of some power outage, do not leave your apartment for anything. (a neighbor told me about the outage back in ’94 where twenty tenants went missing and even till this day they had not been found.) so that remains a mystery because it’s never happened to me yet.
2.	⁠Do not get off on any floors when all buttons are pushed in the elevators just go back down to the lobby get off and get back on and push the button for your floor only.
3.	⁠Do not answer your cell phone in the elevator; it summons the serial killer clown.
4.	⁠Under any circumstances do not leave the building if there is a fog warning, stay calm, do not open any windows or doors, stay exactly where you are until the fog leaves. (Again, I had never been in that situation, but the same neighbor told me in 2011 some idiots opened the front doors and everyone in the lobby was found dead under mysterious circumstances)
5.	⁠Don’t tease the crows at the windows they will pluck your eyes out
6.	⁠Don’t go to the rooftop (Robby tells everyone not to, no context, just do not go up there)
7.	⁠Always compliment the building structure (I’m suspecting the building is alive.)
8.	⁠If a portal opens up in the floor or wall do not enter (I feel like this is a no brainer, but Robby told me this is how people go missing all the time)
9.	⁠Don’t go in the basement only him.
10.	⁠And finally, if it’s an emergency go to the lobby and push the red button on the phone pad and wait for assistance. (Again, Robby gave me no context for that either.)

It struck me as very odd that Robby would give out these warnings or rules to everyone who moves into the building, but he was very urgent about the fog warning. When I tried asking him about it, he shuts up and tells me to mind my own business but the nosey neighbor across from me is always telling me stories, she’s about eighty years old. the sad thing is, the only people I’ve ever seen work here is Robby, Floyd (the front desk manager) and the building owner, Gus, I had never met in person. But I’ve soon been experiencing these warning/rules, although I like to point out, none of these aren’t actually given out by Robby, you just have to experience them yourself and file them under the rules to follow to stay alive or not go missing.

on my third day of living in my apartment, I was put to the test of following these rules and how to properly handle the situation. You remember the elevator rules? Well, there is plenty of them to fill up an entire manual. I suspect there is something wrong with that elevator or the buttons itself. the elevator is big enough for at least five to six people, who aren’t overweight. Its completely made out of metal, all four walls are metal including the floor. the buttons on the right side, each button has its number for each floor, one to fifteen, (note there is not number for the thirteenth floor) and under the first floor is L for lobby, and B for basement but that has a keyhole, only Robby can access that floor. there are no stairs leading to the basement either.

I had just gotten back from work, I was exhausted, shuffling my way through the lobby with Floyd leaning back in his office chair looking at a porno magazine. He’s an interesting guy, he basically gets paid not to give a crap. His greasy hair was a mess, his clothes rumpled, and I suspect he has his own apartment in the back of the office area. I walked up to the elevator, note there is only one. when I get on, I make sure to push four, and the elevator gives a jump then starts going up. sometimes I hear breathing in the elevator, not my own. I kept my eyes on the floor to make sure whatever else in there, knows I’m not curious. As soon as the ding clanked out, it sounded like it always was dying. The moment the doors opened, my cell phone rang, now I didn’t think much of this when I answered my phone as I was getting off the elevator.

“Hello?” there was no answer but static on the end. the call was cut short, and I was left standing in the doorway. when the elevator screeched to let me know I needed to either get back on the elevator or keep moving forward. I did so. I stood in the hallway, I had a bad feeling, something twisted in my gut. Something didn’t feel right. when I turned, everything seemed normal, and yet it somehow felt off. I made my way down the hall to my apartment. 413, I am not as superstitious as some people, but thirteen wasn’t unlucky for me. using my key to open my door and the moment I walked into my apartment I had a bad feeling. It felt off.

That was when I heard it, a high-pitched giggling sound, I could almost feel the building quaking when someone was walking outside in the halls. With each step it took, it felt like it was getting closer and closer. Then a scrapping sound as if something metal was being dragged along the walls. I dropped all my belongings. And turned to the peephole at my door. I watched the hall from where I stood, pleading I was not hallucinating what was happening. Then I saw the shadow getting closer and closer. Pleading that it wasn’t it. until it stopped right by my door, and I knew I was in deep shit. It was a 7 or so foot tall clown in a navy-blue jumpsuit, the clown’s make up was that of an old makeup style, the face was painted on, it was a happy clown face, but the eyes that searched the halls and came to look at my door, the gleam in its eyes. The clown was dragging an axe on the floor, the wooden handle was covered in blood, the blade was sharpened and also covered in said blood. It raised its axe as it turned towards my door.

I backed up slowly as it started hacking at my door, I screamed. I grabbed my purse and ran through my apartment, not sure where to go. so, I ran to my bedroom to the window, I know logically there is no fire escape there, but when I got to the window. I couldn’t for some ungodly reason couldn’t open it. it wouldn’t open. I heard the front door crashing, and the clown high giggles as it walked through my apartment very calmly.

I looked under my bed and thought better of it, I had become the main character in a horror movie, fuck. I scanned my entire room, looking for a place to hide out, that’s when I found a light coming from a line just behind my end table. I ran my hand along the line and realized there was a secret room in my apartment. Suddenly the idea formed in my head, his footsteps were getting closer and closer to my closed bedroom door. I ran to my desk and pushed my desk chair in front of my bedroom door and locked myself inside and ran back to the secret line in my wall. and hurriedly pushed my end table to the side. Pushing on the false wall as hard as I can.

The thump of my bedroom door rattle, the giggles sounded frustrated as it slammed its body into my bedroom door. My breathing ragged and a scream that stuck in my throat, I finally unstuck the false wall and stumbled into a closet. It was a walk-in closet, full of someone else’s clothes and shoes. Hurriedly I pushed the end table back to where it was, and I jumped back into the secret closet and shut the door so quietly, I heard my bedroom door crashing open. I slowly hid into a small space behind the left side of the clothes hanging and waited.

I hurriedly pulled my cellphone out and silenced it and thank God I did. the phone flashed and unknown number was calling me. and I suspected it was the clown. I kept as quiet as I possibly could. my eyes were fixed downward, and I kept my self as quiet as possible. This was insane and I knew it, but I had so many questions, why did I have a secret closet in my bedroom with someone else’s belongings? Why no one mentioned it to me? I could hear his feet, hear him searching through my entire room, hearing crashing sounds, things being flipped. Even the window glass shattering.

Then my phone lit up, and when I recognized the number, Gus’s name was flashing on the screen, I kept my eyes on the door as I answered quietly so the clown couldn’t hear me.

“Hello—”

“Willow,” Gus’s voice sounded muddled as if I was getting bad reception. He sounded worried. “You need to get to the elevator.”

“Uh, well, there’s a problem with that, you see there’s a—”

“I know. you need to run for the elevator right now.”

He hung up the phone before I had any chance to respond back. I got up from my hiding spot in the secret closet and slowly opened the door a crack, there was no clown in sight, but my room looked bad. My bed upturned, my desk chopped to death, my room looked badly tossed. Even my bedroom window as smashed into bits. Slowly I crawled out of the closet and went to my broken door and pushed through the hole in it. slowly tip toeing through the hallway towards the living room. my entire apartment was tossed, and everything was broken.

I didn’t wait around to see if the killer clown was coming back or hiding in some shadowed area, I darted for the front door that know was practically gone. chopped away. I followed the building owner, Gus’s, orders, I took my shoes off to not make any noise. Barefoot and I got out of my apartment and started running down the hall towards the awaiting elevator at the end of the hall. As soon as I got into the elevator, I let out a breath of relief. I knew I was safe, there was something dangerous about this elevator and yet comforting to know I was here, and the killer clown couldn’t get to me.

However, as I turned around as soon as I made it into the elevator. The clown was at the end of the hall watching me, it tipped its head, I could see the confusion in its eyes. As if it couldn’t believe I’ve outsmarted it. the whole front of its navy jumpsuit was covered in blood, that’s when I realized there was a man on the ground. his body was chopped halfway, and I recognized him. his glasses were just a few feet away, his shocked expression permeant on his face, the slightly older man who always brought donuts to me and was kind to me. Mr. Kindling, he was laying in his own pool of blood dead. The clown smiled a rows of sharp shark teeth as blood trickled down his caked make up face. I felt grief hit me, but I pushed the L button and the doors closed and I leaned against the wall and slid down to a sitting position. And felt everything I had gone through was just a nightmare, and yet I wasn’t waking up from it. I felt as if I was going down those hallucination rabbit holes once again.

The door opened to the lobby with impatient people waiting for it. I didn’t have to say anything when I got up and saw Robby standing there, he helped me off the elevator and gave me a cup of coffee and a bag of fast food. We didn’t say anything to each other, as soon as the elevator was back down, he escorted me back to my apartment personally. When we got to my apartment I glanced over at Mr. Kindling’s apartment, the door was wide and everything was gone, it was empty. Pushed inside and that’s when I noticed something odd about the layout of my apartment. I no longer had a one-bedroom apartment rather a two bedroom. it’s been nearly two weeks since.

Now things are just normal for the time being. I hear strange noises now and again. my phone rings with that same unknown number and I don’t answer, I let it go to voice mail. One time I listened to one of its messages and its that high giggling noise and I quickly delete the message. I make sure that I follow the rules, because if I don’t, I might end up the next victim, or missing person. Mr. Kindling has missing posters all over the city, and I’ve met his grandchildren who are concerned that the apartment building put all his stuff in a storage unit. The tapping noises still happens at night, but I ignore it, it became my white noise when I sleep at night. sometimes I wake up hearing the scraping sounds of the axe or screaming somewhere in the building. I’m growing numb to it. yesterday I finally contacted Gus about how my one bedroom is now a two-bedroom apartment and I ask if it was a mix up, because clearly, I had paid for a one bedroom and noticed my rent is up too.

Gus told me that it’s always been a two-bedroom apartment and agreed to move into it, I feel like I’m losing my grip on reality a bit. He emailed me the leasing contract, and it surprised me to see it indeed was for a two-bedroom apartment and I did sign it. I thanked him I suppose I’ll have to start looking for a roommate soon, I know I only have a little bit to pay for the next month’s rent, but I really need to find a roommate. And I realized quickly why I had to do that urgently, not because of the rent well because someone broke into my apartment.

I have a lot more to talk about this building. And I’m sure I’ll give an update once I can and not too busy with work. trust me this weird stuff doesn’t end here, I suspect the killer clown is stalking me now, Gus is hiding something, and I found my copy of the lease and it only says I signed for a one-bedroom apartment. Anyway, I’m hiding in my secret closet in my bedroom, as I said someone broke into my apartment, their going through my stuff. Stay safe, and if you find a secret room in your apartment make good use for it like I have. Oh, and they had just installed a self-coffee dispensing machine in the lobby, Ms. Stevens is complaining about the plumbing, and I suspect the guy who lives above me is a serial killer as well.

1lfkct9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lfkct9/aita_for_cutting_off_my_husbands_family_after/,AITA for cutting off my husband’s family after years of pain?,"This is going to be long, but I’ve stayed quiet for too many years, and I’m tired of carrying shame that doesn’t belong to me. I need to know if I’m the a**hole for finally cutting ties.

When I was 14, I was violently as*aulted at g*npoint by two men. It was brutal. I went through a horrific trial, survived g*ng retaliation, spiraled into drugs and alcohol, clawed my way out, and eventually got justice. One of the men is serving 80 years for ""heinous"" acts he did to me. I’ve spent decades in therapy and on medication trying to heal. That trauma never fully leaves, but I built a life, got married, had a son, and years later, a daughter. I tried to be happy. For all intents and purposes... a lot of the time I was.

Fast forward many many moons... When I was 29, I rented a hotel room for New Year’s Eve to keep myself and my husband from driving drunk. We shared the room with one of his sisters and her husband (my brother-in-law). We were all friends and had hung out countless times before. That night, I got buzzed. My husband tucked me in, kissed me, locked the hotel door, and left to party down the hall. I was the only person asleep in my hotel room.

In the middle of the night, I woke up to my brother-in-law — drunk and high — in bed with me. I freaked out, kicked, hit, screamed. The whole party heard. My husband, his sister, and others came running. My brother-in-law was on the floor, face down, belt off, jeans on but unzipped. He refused to answer any questions jumped up and ran away from the hotel. He left his wife there. The next morning, my husband, his sister (the wife), and I had to go buy me a mo*ning-after pill.

None of us left our marriages. She stayed with him, and I stayed with my husband — not because I forgave what happened, but because I believed I had to for the sake of family. I am also deeply in love with my husband and he did not cause this. I went deeper into therapy, deeper into medication, and smiled through every holiday for years while being expected to sit across the table from the man who violated me and who never once took accountability.

In fact, three weeks after it happened, I tried to be the bigger person and invited them over for coffee with us. He gave a fake, smug apology and left. Then? He showed up at my house unannounced, let himself in, took off his boots, and laid on my couch like he lived there. I was in the back of the house cleaning and had no idea he was even in my home. When I saw him, I panicked, took a photo as proof, called my husband and his wife, and threw him out.

After that, we cut direct contact with him, but he still came to family events. I was expected to “play nice.” He’d smack my arm and shout “Hey, sis!” in this mocking, aggressive way in front of everyone. No one ever stopped him.

Now he’s a “man of God” — a preacher — and his religious status is being used as a weapon against me. I’ve been told I’m the problem for not letting go, for not “seeing how he’s changed.”

Recently, I finally told my husband’s family that I won’t be attending events anymore. I’ve done my time. I’ve protected everyone’s comfort at the expense of my own for too long. My kids are old enough now that I don’t have to fake it anymore. Not that I'm going to tell them all the details of it or anything. I just figured I no longer have to go.

And that’s when my other sister-in-law — not his wife, but her sister — lit into me. She sent me a series of texts saying I need to “get over it,” that I’m “not a victim,” and that I’m “carelessly selfish” for “driving a wedge” in the family. She said I should just “come and be happy” — because, apparently, him being drunk and high makes it all okay. She is a man of God now.

What’s even sicker? She knows that not long after what happened to me, he tried to sleep with HER! Her own sister's husband — the one defending him now. He barged into her room drunk and asked if they could “do it.” She told him no and kicked him out. My best friend also had a disturbing experience with him. But somehow I’m the villain for cutting him off.

I’ve stayed quiet for so long. I’ve medicated my way through holidays. I’ve chosen peace over justice. I’ve let people think I’m cold, unforgiving, dramatic — all for the sake of my husband’s family. I didn’t want to break things apart. But now they’re calling me the wrecking ball?

So Reddit… Am I the a**hole for finally saying I’m done? For choosing peace over pretending? For cutting off the people who enable the man who hurt me?

I just want to feel like I’m not crazy.",1,1750362917.0,AITAH,12,0.67,False
1lfkcmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1lfkcmu/808_world_off_prospecting/,808 World – Off Prospecting,"Wasn't expecting this one. Just popped out while writing the next 'Blacksmith chapter.

\*-\*

 

The Prospector, sometime in the past…

Mr. Gregory “The Prospector” Wilson sat on a small boulder, facing the Greate Lake Superior. A smile played across his lips as anticipation for the day’s adventure bubbled up inside. “Today is going to be a great day.”

A short time later, a gaggle of children and adults began to gather, until the head of the local colleges rockhounding club arrived, and got the meeting started. “Ladies, gentlemen, and everyone else! Welcome to the monthly meetup!” He looked up when Greg jumped down from the boulder. “Oh, and I see Mr. Greg has joined us again this month?”

Greg nodded, “I was in the area again, so I decided to come along.”

“I assume you are looking for the “One True Agate” again?” Mack, the leader of the club asked. “You could join the prospectors and find a little gold.”

“That’s too close to my day job for it to be fun.” Greg replied, a slight frown crossing his face for a moment. “I’m more interested in agates and similar rocks.”

“To each their own.” Mack smiled. “Alright folks, let’s get started!”

It only took a short while for the club to assemble their gear on the rocky beach and begin the day’s work. Most of the club were working a pair of high bankers in the shore\*; while the last four, including Greg, began combing the beach and shallow water looking for agates, flower stone, jadeite\*\*, and nephrite\*\*. As Greg passed by the gold prospectors, he used his power to add a little more of the lakes flower gold to where they were digging.

Several hours passed with many laughs, a water fight, and several flint arrowheads found. Near the end of it all, Greg stumbled, literally, upon what he was searching for. An agate the size of his head. He had been walking along a stone outcropping into the lake, when he stepped on a slick stone, and fell face first into the lake. Gasping from the shock of the cold water, he surfaced, coughed, and looked down through the mostly clear water and saw it. A rock almost as big as his skull. He picked it up with the intent to throw it deeper into the lake, when his eyes spotted the banding in the stone. He walked it to the beach, and scoured the slime and silt from it with wet sand, and then began to shout. “I FOUND IT!” attracting the attention from most of the group who were in the middle of packing up for the day. As the group studied the stone, they were mostly quiet, except for the occasional whistle of appreciation. It was a banded Lake Superior agate, weighing in at around fifteen pounds.

The next day, Greg flew home, agate under his arm on the plane.

Several years later…

Mr. Gregory “The Prospector” Wilson, stared at the empty stand behind the shattered bulletproof glass in his living room. *My agate. It’s gone!* He did the smart thing first, as he exited his home, he called the local police, specifically his friend and drinking buddy, retired FBI agent Johan Johnson.

When Johan answered the phone, he yawned into the receiver, “I’m not going drinking with you. It’s 11pm, and I have work in the morning.”

“Someone stole my Agate.”

There was a scrambling sound on the other side of the phone, then Johan replied, “We will be there in ten minutes. I’ll be calling the Agency while I’m driving.”

\-

Four hours later, the premises had been thoroughly searched, people questioned, and the local diner visited. Around the largest table in the diners back, the Prospector, Johan, and three agents from three different agencies sat, drinking cold stale coffee. “I don’t get it.” Johan began. “Of all the things someone would steal, *that* is what they took?”

Agent Johnson of the FBI nodded his head, “I could see taking the three-pound nugget, or the nine-ounce nugget that was still in its host rock, but an agate?”

Agent Johnson of the \[FNORD\] agency shook his head, “Anyone in the geological know, would know that the agate in question is quite rare. The largest on record is in a bank, but not as well defined, as it were. This specimen is unique.”

Agent Johnson of the CIA-Meta Division nodded in agreement, “Not to mention who found it.”

Johan scowled at the agents, “Not like that. It’s that they took Greg’s prized possession! You three are all well aware of how much economical damage Greg could inflict to get it back.”

The three agents blinked almost in unison, before piling out of the booth, and scrabbling for their phones. Johan and Greg watched in glee as the agents bolted for the parking lot.

Greg laughed for a moment, then frowned again, “That was funny to see and all, but did you really need to go that far?”

“Do you understand how much you could undermine the world’s economy if you released all of just your copper stores onto the market?” Johan asked. “Let alone the rest of your precious metals?”

“Hmm, you do make a good point.” Greg replied after a moment. “But still- “

Johan cut him off, “” But still” my ass! You know damn well that you would tank the whole market just with that. The price of copper falls drastically overnight, and the markets worldwide take a hit. It will snowball. And how many tons of copper do you have in your underground vault?”

“It’s not a vault! It’s just sunk under a mountain.”

“HALF A MILE under a mountain.” Johan snarked. “Then there’s the Silver, Gold, Aluminum from a few decades past, rare earth minerals, uranium, and the list goes on and on.”

“Okay. Fine. I could crash the planet.” Greg conceded. “But this is where I keep my stuff, so I wouldn’t do that. Besides, my power is connected to the market price. No price, no powers.”

“Then the price of gravel or sand or some other stupid thing will go up instead; and boom, powers back.”

“I know, I know.” Greg replied, sinking into his seat more. “Hey Jan? Could you fill me up again? And maybe a slice of your lemon pie?”

“Sure thing, sugar!” Jan replied from the kitchen. “But you know I’m going to up-charge you for making me stay open this late!”

“Jan, you haven’t slept in…45 years. How do you get off calling this late?” Johan asked.

“Just for that, Officer Johnson, I’m going to jack up your cost too.” Jan responded on her way to the table. “How dare you remind a girl of her age?”

That all said, this story does give me a spot to introduce an actual plot line to the 808 world, with a rather fun ""Actual"" villain taking the stage. 

You are probably asking when the other half of the story is going to come out. The answer is: I have no F\*\*\*ing idea. I do know that the next 'Blacksmith chapter will be out next week, maybe even by Tuesday.

This has solely been through CICO, weighing absolutely everything on the scale and using measurements for any oil. All of this goes into cronometer, always double checking that labels match the data. I'm eating at high protein, moderate carbs and fat. I also weigh myself at the same time every day, placing emphasis on what I lose weekly (I don't care about daily fluctuations).

At my current weight of 241 (5'9), my maintenance are 2470 and I eat 1600, an 870 calorie deficit.

Anyway, here we are today: the last \~50 days I've introduced resistance/endurance training with Kettlebells 3x a week. The last 2 weeks I've also introduced nearly daily walking of an hour (\~6k steps). Ever since the additional walking I haven't lost any weight. In fact, I've somehow gained nearly a pound in the last week. Mind you, even with the added exercise I have not been tracking how many calories the workouts supposedly burn so I haven't been trying to eat back any of the burned calories.

My first thought was that I was tracking something incorrectly so I've really dialed in on what I've been consuming, eating nearly the same thing every day, triple checking the way I measure, any oil used, and so on. I'm basically eating the same god damn thing every day just to be sure: Two egg+bean wraps in the morning with coffee, and for dinner baked chicken thighs with some rice (I don't snack, and all I drink is water). There is very little room for me to fuck up calorie counting with what I'm cooking.

So what gives? I'm very frustrated.",0,1750362859.0,loseit,2,0.5,False

1lfk4bj,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lfk4bj/ocd_keeps_the_bad_things_away/,OCD Keeps the Bad Things Away,"The air in Dr. Bushma's office felt thin, too bright, like a stage where I was meant to perform. She was a quiet stream, she always was, but today her calmness felt like a warm, steady hand, a subtle encouragement against the restless feeling beneath my skin. Sunlight poured in, making dust motes dance – tiny, innocent things, unlike the frantic, invisible things I did without thinking every day.

""How are we doing with the tapping this week, Joseph?"" Her voice. So soft, filled with genuine concern.

""Same as always,"" I mumbled, my fingers twitching against the armchair's worn fabric. ""It's just... I can't. It's like an ache in my bones if I don't. A deep, tired craving.""

She nodded, her expression gentle as she scribbled on her pad. ""Joseph, we've talked about this. That terrible fear, that feeling something awful will happen if you don't do these things – that's a big part of OCD. Your brain, trying to keep you safe, has made you think your actions stop bad things from happening, but it's not real. It's a habit. A really strong one, yes, but still just a habit. And I know how hard it is to break. But we're going to face it together. Let's test it. See what happens when you just... don't.""

Not real? A cold, growing doubt, like a shadow lengthening at dusk, washed over me. ""But what if it's not just a habit?"" My words sounded childish, even to me, but the terror was genuine, a bitter taste at the back of my throat. ""What if... what if it actually is keeping something bad from happening?""

Dr. Bushma met my gaze, steady as a rock, her eyes holding both understanding and unwavering resolve. ""That's your anxiety talking, Joseph. That's the fear trying to stay in charge, and it's a powerful feeling, I know. But we've been working on those impulses. We need to challenge them, to show your brain that these terrible things happening aren't actually linked to your actions. Small steps, remember? Just one less tap. Then two. Today, our goal is no taps at all before you start a task. I believe in you.""

Easy for her to say, I thought, the words echoing, distorted, in my head as I walked home. My whole body screamed. It wasn't just an urge; it was a strong need, like an itch deep in my bones, a deep, primal need to make the noise. I'd tried, of course. The first time, I stood at the bathroom sink, hand hovering over the toothbrush. But the fear was a physical weight, pressing down, whispering of cracked teeth, of a sudden, unexpected fall down the stairs, a fractured skull against cold tile. My hand shook, and then, almost without thinking, it slammed against the counter, three sharp, desperate taps. The relief was quick, shameful, a momentary easing of a pressure I couldn't name.

The next day, I tried with the coffee maker. The fear was a cold knot, tightening, contracting in my stomach, promising a burnt house, a gas leak, the smell of smoke filling my lungs, burning them from the inside. I stood there for what felt like an hour, sweating, fighting myself. In the end, the taps came, quick and desperate, a surrender. It was exhausting, this constant, silent battle. Each failure felt like a confirmation of the whispers, made me feel like I was really trapped. But today, no matter what, I was going to not tap.

I stood at the kitchen sink, the shiny faucet mocking me, a chrome challenge. My hand hovered, trembling, just inches from the cold, hard counter. I held my breath, the air thick in my throat. Don't tap. Don't tap. Don't tap. Every part of me screamed, a quiet panic inside. I clenched my jaw so hard it ached, a knot of pure panic tightening in my chest. With a grunt, I forced my hand to the faucet, twisting it on without a single tap.

Nothing happened.

The water ran, clear and cool. The air didn't catch fire. No sirens wailed down the street, their loud cries for a disaster. A wave of pure relief washed over me, then a deep, heavy tiredness, like I'd just run a race I didn't even know I was in. I did it. I actually, truly did it. I washed the dishes, each plate feeling like a quiet, small victory against the constant, sneaky battle in my head. Maybe she was right.

That night, I slept soundly for the first time in what felt like forever, the quiet in my bedroom felt good. The next morning, I woke up feeling lighter than I ever thought possible, the heavy weight of unseen fear lifted. No taps on the bedside table before getting up. No checking the door lock seven times. Every time I ignored a compulsion, it felt like taking off a heavy blanket, revealing a fragile, new freedom underneath.

The next three days were a strange, unsettling struggle. Each morning, I'd wake with that familiar lightness, a sense of triumph. But as the day wore on, the urges would creep back, sneaky and wouldn't go away, like smoke creeping under a closed door. I fought them, sometimes winning, sometimes losing, each battle leaving me totally drained and empty.

Day One: I managed to go most of the day without tapping, a string of quiet victories that filled me with a fragile hope. It felt like walking on a tightrope, every muscle tense, my nerves buzzing, and I did give in a couple of times, a quick, almost unconscious tap on a surface or an object, but the majority of tasks I completed without them. 

That evening, though, a small unsettling feeling began to creep in, a cold, unwelcome feeling. I found myself glancing at the old, built-in closet in my bedroom. I was sure I'd closed it properly, latched the simple brass catch. But sometimes, when I wasn't looking directly, it seemed to be a fraction of an inch more open than I remembered, the darkness behind the gap a deeper black. A faint, very quiet scratching sound, dry and insistent, would drift from its direction. I told myself it was just the old house settling, or maybe a mouse in the walls, a common explanation. But the air around that corner of the room always felt a little colder, a little heavier, like a small, cold spot.

Day Two: The urges were stronger now, a constant buzz under my skin, needing to be let out. Just one tap. I slipped a few times, a quick, desperate tap on a surface, a hurried three taps on another. Each time, a wave of hating myself, a sick feeling of giving in, but also a quick, unsettling feeling that I'd stopped something bad from happening, like closing a gap. 

The scratching from the closet seemed a little clearer now, less like a mouse, more on purpose, steady, almost smart. I started to notice the tiny gap in the door more often, even when I was sure I'd pushed it flush. My paranoia grew, a cold, hard knot in my stomach, growing larger with every tick of the clock.

Day Three: I was totally exhausted, the constant fight against my own mind wearing me down. The taps were harder to resist than ever, almost automatic, an automatic fear. But on this day, I managed to push through most of them, giving in only to a few, desperate urges. Just give in. And the closet... the scratching was clear now, a steady, insistent sound that matched the beat of my own urges. It wasn't random; it was a beat, a pulse. I could swear the gap in the door was wider, too, a small crack of deeper darkness visible even from across the room, like a mouth just barely open. A faint, terrible smell, like burnt hair and rotten eggs and something else, something metallic and sweet, like old blood, began to seep from that tiny opening, a sickly sweet and sharp smell that turned my stomach, made my eyes water.

That evening, as the last bit of sun bled from the sky, making the room dark purple and grey, I walked into my bedroom. The air suddenly dropped several degrees, a clear, unnatural cold filling the room, raising gooseflesh on my arms. That faint, rhythmic scratching sound was undeniably there, coming from the corner, from inside the closet. My eyes went straight to the old, built-in closet. I always thought I kept that door firmly shut, latched, a small victory in my daily battles. But now, looking closer, I saw it: a tiny gap, almost invisible in the gloom, but definitely there, a small crack of deeper black than the shadows around it. The scratching was softer now, almost a whisper from behind the wood, like fingernails dragging on rough, dry rock.

My heart pounded like a drum, a frantic, desperate bird beating in my chest. Slowly, against every instinct, I moved closer. Don't be stupid. It's nothing. Just the old house. The scratching grew louder as I neared, the exact same beat as my taps. Not my taps, exactly, but that chillingly exact rhythm I'd lived by for so long. It knows. It knows my rhythm.

And then I felt it.

A sudden, intense coldness made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck, like someone was standing right behind me, their breath cold and stale, thick with that rotting, metallic sweetness, against my skin. No. No, no, no. Inside the pitch-black closet, the scratching picked up, now a fast, high-pitched scratching, still matching my tapping rhythm, matching my panicked heartbeat. That's when I finally got it, the truth hit me like a foul smell. Every time I had tapped, I had been locking something in. Every three taps, I had been making an invisible lock stronger, holding whatever horror was in that dark, cold space inside, on the other side, from coming out. Oh God. I was right. All this time, I was right.

I stumbled back, a short, rough gasp caught in my throat. The huge, unseen thing seemed to pause, and a low, deep rumble, like the very ground itself was shifting, a deep groan, shook the floorboards beneath my feet. It came from the closet. Then, the scratching suddenly stopped. The silence that followed was total, heavy, almost comforting, a false promise. I foolishly let out a breath, a flicker of desperate hope sparking that it was over, that it had just given up, retreated into its deep prison. It's gone.

But then, a cold, wet whisper, impossibly close, brushed my ear, so close I felt the shiver on my skin, the words like wet stone rubbing on sand. 

""Tap. Tap. Tap.""

I spun around, my vision blurring, and ran, bursting out of the room, down the hall. My lungs burned, air burning, the silence of the closet now more terrifying than any scream. The front door was a distant rectangle of fading light, my only way out, a promise of escape. I threw myself at it, hands reaching, stretching, feeling the cool night air already promising freedom, a clean, fresh breath.

Just as my hand touched the doorknob, something seized my ankles. A strong, impossible grip, not like flesh or bone, but something cold, hard, and utterly relentless. A piercing, high-pitched whine shrieked from the closet, a sound that hurt my ears badly, followed by an overwhelming wave of that rotting, metallic smell, sickening and choking. Then, a loud, desperate scream tore from my throat as my feet were suddenly, violently, off the floor. I was yanked back, hard, right across the doorway, my head slamming against the floorboards with a sickening bang. And then everything was a choking darkness, thick and choking, a deep, heavy silence.

The taps continue, you see. They have to. It's a constant, never-ending rhythm that isn't just in what was my own broken memory anymore, but everywhere now. A soft click from your keyboard. The gentle hum of your fridge. That subtle, steady beat you sometimes hear in your own ear. You probably brush it off, right? You tell yourself it's just your imagination, a lingering thought from a spooky story, a fragment of a nightmare. But that coldness at the back of your neck... and that weird feeling, that clear tingle you get when your back is turned to a dark, empty room, as if something just stepped in behind you, something old and waiting, something that learned its rhythm from you...

Do you hear the tapping?
Do you feel us behind you?

**I feel like dark clouds are gathering above our heads because we either lack clarity or don't see enough progress to keep going. It's a tough place to be, but pretty much every entrepreneur suffers from this. So here I am, looking for a piece of bread, I mean, validation!**

>Imagine plugging your company data into a tool and instead of scrolling through a jungle of dashboards and noodle charts early in the morning, you simply type in ""Who's the most profitable employee this month?"" and go grab yourself a cup of coffee.

At least that's the ""marketing"" part of the tool. I'm looking for insights and advice on how it could grow and where else to apply it.

In general, it's a platform that currently uses our company data as the primary data set. It has several integrations like Jira, Everhour, Sendgrid, and some book-keeping software to pull salaries and other related data. We have data charts to visualize all of this data, but the highlight is that you can chat with an AI agent to pull specific data for you.

Under the hood, we have developed several agents. Like worker agents, QA agents, reasoning agents, calculation agents, etc. These agents can then choose from a variety of tools that interact with said integrations.

One tool may pull Jira data and combine it with Everhour tracked time, while the other tool may calculate revenue, profits, margins, and make a forecast based on the efficiency of any employee.

The AI here is like a director of smaller, more specialized AI agents who have access to tools or functions. And the final result is then returned to the user.

On top of that, we have added periodical analyses. Let's say you may ask the AI to ""Generate a report of who tracked the most time and worked on the most Jira tickets. Send it to me every day at 5 pm"". This would trigger an analysis generator agent that would schedule a job that generates said report and sends it to you via email.

So far, it's been great using it internally, and I see a lot of potential going into different industries like e-commerce, logistics, or some SMBs. We have even started working on preparing a demo on how it would integrate with one of the most used bookkeeping software in the country, known for its archaic complexity and rampant confusion.

I’m excited to announce that BidFair has officially entered its live beta phase! That means we’re no longer using test data from Stripe, everything is now fully functional with real users and real payments.

If you sign up, you’ll now need to provide accurate business or personal information to use our services.

⸻

What to Expect:

BidFair is still in its early days. I’m building this solo, no funding, no team, just a lot of long nights, coffee, and passion. Because of that, growth will likely be slow at first. But I’m here for the long haul, and I believe in the mission.

If BidFair gains traction, I’ll absolutely be looking to grow the team, with support, marketing, and development roles. For now, it’s just me.

⸻

Bugs? Suggestions? I’m Listening.

This is a massive project for one person, so expect some bumps in the road. I’ve launched BidFair Fix, where you can report bugs and submit ideas directly. I want your feedback, it’s how BidFair gets better.

I suspect there will be plenty of issues here and there, but I will be actively working with user’s who find issues to fix them. I just need my initial base of user’s to have patience with BidFair, and we will get everything and anything sorted!

⸻

Whether this project soars or stumbles, I’ve had an incredible journey building it. I’ve learned more than I ever imagined, and I’m proud to be launching something I truly believe in.

Thanks for being part of the journey.

I've had my Gastric byass almost 10 years ago!!! (Female 30Y/o, 170cm long) went from 145kg to 78kg and now 10 years later i'm on 88KG. 

I want to go back to my healthy BMI which is around 72KG. but All I can read and see is cal deficit, I need a cal deficit, **BUT NOT TOO LITTLE**. Okay. Help?!

I know that an average woman without any excersise bruns around 1900/2000 cals a day.   
But boy is it hard for me now to even hit the 1300 a day! 

When I started this (last Saturday) I just stopped snacking.  
I have one latte machiato coffee without sugar but normal semi-skimmed milk in the morning, everything. else. is. water. no cordial, no zero cokes, just water.  
And i've never done this before, and boy. IM FULL! 

I wake up around 07:00 each morning, have my coffee, have my vitamine pill an hour later, and then around 10am I have breakfast.   
Then around 12/1pm I have lunch.  
Then around 5/6pm dinner.

And that's me done for the past 5 days. I make sure that I have ''normal'' portions, protein, as less sugar as I can, love chicken, and make overnight oats. But that all comes to about 900/1000 cals.

Is this too little? is this unhealthy? will i not lose weight?   
I try to have a 45min full body workout 2/3 times a week as I work fully from home so my daily steps is 2000 haha. So i'm not a total gym nerd.

Anyone got any tips? am I doing things bad? or is it okay because I have a gastric bypass?   
I try to not get any snacks as I don't have cravings at the moment, like AT ALL, and im scared that if I get back to eating candy or stuff, those will come back. (Because lets be honest, thats how those 12 kg's came back in the first place!!)

The Unfair Advantage for Ambitious Australian Businesses.

# The End of SEO Agencies in Australia? How to Get Backlinks on Autopilot.

For too long, Australian businesses have been forced to pay outrageous fees to SEO agencies for slow, opaque, and ineffective results. That era is over. Discover the revolutionary AI software that finds high-authority online articles and automatically inserts your website link, building powerful backlinks that dominate Google in Australia. This isn't just better SEO. This is the future.

No credit card required. Witness the power of automated link insertion today.

# The Great Australian SEO Stranglehold (And Why It's Costing You a Fortune)

As an Australian business owner, you're a fighter. You compete in a tough market, dealing with high operating costs and the tyranny of distance. You have a world-class product or service, whether you're a tech innovator in the Sydney Startup Hub, a professional services firm on Collins Street in Melbourne, or a vital resources company in Perth. But there's a huge, invisible barrier holding you back: your customers can't find you online.

The Australian digital landscape is dominated by a handful of massive corporations—the big banks, the major retailers, the international giants. They have colossal marketing budgets that you can't possibly match. The key to competing with them is Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), and the most critical part of SEO is acquiring backlinks. These are links from other websites that signal your authority to Google. The problem? The traditional method of getting these links is a slow, manual, and incredibly expensive ""grind"" that is rigged in favour of the big players. For an ambitious SME in Brisbane, a family-owned winery in the Barossa Valley, or a tourism operator in Cairns, the old system is a guaranteed path to frustration and wasted money.

# Why Traditional SEO is a ""Dog's Breakfast"" for Aussie Businesses

If you've ever tried to improve your rankings with an [SEO agency in Australia](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-service/) or on your own, this frustrating story will be all too familiar:

* **The Agency ""Black Box"":** You hire an SEO agency in Sydney or Melbourne that makes big promises. They charge an eye-watering monthly retainer, and in return, you get a confusing report with vanity metrics and a few low-quality links from websites that look like they were made in the 90s. There's no transparency, no real control, and your phone isn't ringing any more often. It feels like you're paying for nothing.
* **The Soul-Crushing Manual ""Hustle"":** To save money, you try the DIY approach. Your team spends hundreds of hours scouring the web for Aussie blogs, news sites, and industry portals. You send out thousands of polite, personalized emails that get completely ignored. You're competing with a global flood of spam, and your important message is lost. The return on your time investment is practically zero.
* **The ""Guest Posting"" Time Sink:** You're told the key is to write ""high-quality guest posts."" So you pour your expertise and days of your time into crafting a brilliant article, only to have it rejected or published on a tiny, irrelevant blog that gives you no SEO benefit whatsoever. You're giving away your best knowledge for free. This is not a scalable strategy for [SEO in Australia](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-tool/).
* **The ""Tall Poppy"" Effect:** The digital space is crowded. As soon as you start getting a little traction, the big players with their massive backlink profiles seem to effortlessly rank above you for every important keyword. Their existing authority creates a barrier that feels impossible to break through with manual effort alone.

This outdated model is a dead end. It is inefficient, unpredictable, and financially crippling for most Australian businesses. It ensures the status quo remains, where the rich get richer and smaller businesses struggle for scraps. But what if you could bypass this broken system entirely? What if a new technology could allow you to go around the gatekeepers and place your links directly into high-authority online articles that Australians are already reading?

>""We're a logistics company based in Western Sydney. We were paying a North Shore agency $6,000 a month for SEO. After a year, our rankings were stagnant. It was clear they were just going through the motions. We needed a disruptive technology that could deliver real authority, not just reports.""

# The Digital Leapfrog: AI-Powered Automatic Link Insertion

It's time to stop thinking about ""building"" links and start thinking about ""placing"" them. This is the revolution of \*\*AI-powered automatic link insertion\*\*, a groundbreaking technology that is fundamentally changing the economics of SEO. AI Monstertools is the Australian leader in this new frontier.

The old strategy is like trying to get a new, unknown brand of sauce onto the shelves at Coles or Woolworths. It requires endless meetings, negotiations, and huge fees. Our new strategy is like having a secret key that lets you find the perfect empty spot on the shelf and place your product there instantly. Our advanced AI scans the web to find popular, high-authority articles already trusted by Google. Then, it identifies the perfect, contextually relevant ""gap"" within that article to insert a link to your website. This is what our [automated link insertion](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-tool/) software does for you online, giving you immediate access to an existing, high-trust audience.

# How AI Link Insertion Gives You an Unfair Advantage:

* **Step 1: Deep Semantic Analysis of Australian Content:** Our AI reads and understands millions of articles from Australian news sites (like [news.com.au](http://news.com.au), The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age), popular blogs, industry journals, and government sites. It uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand the precise topic and context of every page, not just surface-level keywords.
* **Step 2: Identifying High-Value ""Link Gaps"":** The AI finds specific sentences or phrases within this high-authority content where a link to your website would be a natural, helpful addition for the reader. For example, it might find a major news article on the Australian housing market that discusses a specific suburb but doesn't link to a local real estate expert. If you're that expert, our AI finds that opportunity.
* **Step 3: Uncovering ""Lost"" Brand Mentions:** Our system constantly scans the web for mentions of your company name, your products, or your key people that are not linked. These are the easiest, most powerful links you can get. The AI finds these ""unlinked brand mentions"" and prepares them for automated link acquisition.
* **Step 4: Automated, Scalable, and Precise Placement:** This is the core innovation of AI Monstertools. Using a network of publisher partnerships and advanced API communications, our software automates the process of securing the link insertion within the identified ""link gap."" This happens at a scale and speed that no human team or traditional agency could ever achieve. This is the pinnacle of [automated link building](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-tool/) technology.

Consider the immense power of this. Every month, a steady stream of new, powerful, contextual links pointing to your website from articles that Google already trusts and ranks highly. The impact on your search engine rankings, your brand visibility, and your bottom line is transformative. This isn't a future promise; it's the reality AI Monstertools delivers to Australian businesses today.

# Stop Asking for Links. Start Owning Your Place.

The old way is about begging for a seat at the table. The new, intelligent method is about finding an empty chair and taking it. See how our AI software can build your website's authority by placing your links with surgical precision.

# AI Monstertools: Your Digital Growth Engine for Australia

AI Monstertools is more than just a tool; it is a comprehensive, end-to-end platform for building digital authority in the competitive Australian market.

This is the intelligence behind our operation. Our AI has been specifically trained on the nuances of the Australian market. It understands Aussie slang, geography, and culture.

# Your Questions on SEO in Australia, Answered

# Is this AI link insertion method safe? Will Google penalize my site?

It is fundamentally safer than any other link building method. Safety is our number one priority. Because our AI focuses on placing links where they are contextually relevant and genuinely useful to the reader, the links appear 100% natural. Google's algorithms are designed to reward websites that provide a good user experience, and a relevant link within a great article is a key part of that. We strictly avoid all ""black-hat"" tactics and our 'Brand Shield' protocol provides constant protection, ensuring your website's reputation is always secure.

# My business is in Perth. Can you overcome the ""tyranny of distance"" for me?

Absolutely. We understand the unique challenges for businesses in Western Australia. Our AI is perfect for overcoming digital distance. It can target national industry publications, east-coast business journals, and international sites relevant to the resources sector, ensuring your **Perth**\-based business achieves national and global visibility. At the same time, it can find opportunities on local Perth news and community sites to strengthen your local authority.

# We are a creative agency in Melbourne. How do you cater to a specific city culture?

Our AI understands the cultural nuances of different Australian cities. For a creative agency in a vibrant hub like **Melbourne** or **Brisbane**, our AI will prioritize link opportunities on websites related to arts, culture, design, food, and lifestyle. It will find articles in publications like Broadsheet or The Urban List and identify opportunities to insert a link to your agency, positioning you at the heart of the creative scene.

# What about businesses in Adelaide, Canberra, Hobart, or Darwin?

Yes. Our service is designed for businesses across all of Australia. Whether you're a winery in **Adelaide**'s surrounding valleys, a professional services firm in **Canberra** targeting government contracts, a tourism operator in **Hobart**, or a business servicing the unique market of **Darwin**, our AI will find the most relevant local, state-based, and national link opportunities to boost your specific business.

# How does this service work for businesses in major regional centres?

We provide a huge advantage for businesses in major regional cities like the **Gold Coast**, **Newcastle**, **Wollongong**, **Geelong**, and the **Sunshine Coast**. Our AI can target highly relevant local news portals (e.g., the Geelong Advertiser, Newcastle Herald), community websites, and business directories that big city agencies often ignore, building powerful local trust. Simultaneously, it targets national sites to ensure you can compete with your capital city rivals.

# Is this truly automated, or do I need to be an SEO expert to use it?

It is designed to be truly automated for the busy Australian business owner. You do not need any technical knowledge. The setup takes only a few minutes. Our platform and our team of experts handle all the complex work behind the scenes. You get all the benefits of a world-class SEO team without the high cost or the need for expertise.

# How is this different and better than just buying links?

""Buying links"" usually means paying for a link on a low-quality, toxic website (a ""link farm"" or PBN) that will eventually get your site penalized by Google. It is a very risky and short-term tactic. Our AI-powered link insertion is completely different. We earn placements on legitimate, high-authority websites where your link adds real value. It is a safe, sustainable, and powerful white-hat strategy that builds long-term brand equity.

# How quickly can I expect to see results for my Australian business?

You will start seeing new, high-authority backlinks appear in your dashboard within the first 30 days. Because we place links on pages that Google already trusts, the impact on your rankings is much faster than traditional methods. You can expect to see measurable improvements in your Google search position for your target keywords within 60-90 days, leading to a significant and sustained increase in website traffic and customer inquiries.

# Stop Competing. Start Dominating the Australian Market.

The Australian market is too competitive to rely on slow, outdated, and expensive SEO methods. While your rivals are stuck paying retainers to traditional agencies, you can deploy a smarter, faster, and more powerful strategy. The choice is yours: continue to struggle for visibility, or seize the future with AI and become the undisputed leader in your field.

1lfjsl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKongDisneyland/comments/1lfjsl9/overly_detailed_hkdl_trip_report_may_1314_for_2/,(Overly detailed) HKDL Trip Report May 13-14 for 2 Adults No Kids (1 night hotel / 2 day park),"*TLDR at the bottom of the wall of text.*

Big thanks to this subreddit for helping us plan our first trip to HKDL! I had been years ago but this was my partner's first time. Our first time together! Just us two adults, no kids. We came from California and have been to Disneyland Resort and California Adventure plenty (have not been back since pre-COVID). 

Here’s a breakdown of our two days for those who are curious or are looking to plan for late spring/early summer:

*\* Note: It was so hot and humid. Bring a fan, cooling towel, and spare battery bank to keep your phone charged. Look for every opportunity to sit/stand in air conditioning. Bring bug spray and sun block to protect your skin.*

# What we booked:

**Online Hotel Package: 1 Night Hotel Stay at Explorer’s Lodge + Breakfast Buffet for Two**

# What we purchased as add-ons:

* 2 day park tickets
* Dim sum lunch at Crystal Lotus for Day 1
* Explorer’s Club Semi-Buffet Dinner Package with Momentous Viewing for Day 1
* Early Entry for Day 2
* Reserved the Archivist for end of Day 2

Yes, it ended up being a lot of food.. but we were here to enjoy and celebrate our first HKDL experience together!

We also did **not** purchase Premier Access because the wait times were fairly short and it didn't feel necessary with the level of crowds. You have the option to buy DPA after entering and seeing how busy it actually is. We had two days to explore so we did not feel rushed to experience everything in one day. HKDL very doable in one day but more comfortable if you can spread it between two days, especially if you stay at one of the Disney Hotels. The separate hotel and Early Entry entrance is a big plus to get ahead of security lines in the morning.

# Tuesday 5/13

We took the the MTR from Ho Man Tin to DLR station and then hopped on the hotel shuttle bus. It was quite a journey with the transfers but we wanted to take the Disney MTR line at least once :) Taxi is the way to go if you are wanting to get there faster. 

*Time stamps in this trip report are approximate*.

**11:25** \- Arrived at Explorer’s Lodge. Check in was smooth and the Cast Member helped arrange a car ride to Disneyland Hotel since we had lunch reservations at Crystal Lotus at 12:00. They took care of our luggage and handed us our park tickets and hotel key card/envelope.

**12:00** \- Mickey and Friends Dim Sum Lunch Set at Crystal Lotus. Each dish was adorable and delicious. Service was amazing and the whole experience was enjoyable. We were very full by the end of the meal. Took our time browsing the hotel stores.

**14:30ish** \- Shuttle to the park and went through hotel guest security line. They check the date on your hotel envelope which is good! 

**15:00** \- Walked through Main Street and took pictures. Went to Tomorrowland - rode Hyperspace Mountain, Iron Man Experience, and Antman & the Wasp (all 15 min or less!) then got some Marvel merch.

**16:30** \- Walked through Adventureland to get to Mystic Point but Mystic Manor was closed :(

Cast Member told us they would re-open May 20. *More about this later... :)*

Went back towards Grizzly Gulch and rode Runaway Mine Cars \~20min wait. 

Went to Toy Storyland and rode RC Racer which was also \~20min. Slinky Dog and Parachute Drop were much longer waits so we decided to do them on day 2. We really enjoyed the Dole Whip soft serve and strawberry Dolewhip drink from Jessie’s Snack Roundup.

Got some more merch and sent it to the hotel via **Package Express** \- free service if you’re a hotel guest! *If you’re not staying at one of the hotels you can have your merch sent to the main entrance (outside of main gate) and pick it up after 3 hours. This is very convenient so you don’t have to rent a locker or carry all of your souvenirs throughout the day!*

**18:00** \- Checked in at Explorer’s Club for Semi-Buffet and received wristbands for reserved viewing of Momentous. Enjoyed a welcome drink and ordered our choice of entree (we got the sea bass and Wagyu burger) before buffet opened after \~15min. 

Buffet had different salads, cheese & meats, biscuits, side dishes, and a whole dessert section. They also have other stations for more substantial servings of international foods. A LOT of food to choose from plus your entree. If you plan to eat a lot, this is worth it. 

Afterwards we walked a bit to digest and shopped around the nearby stores. While walking through Adventureland we caught some of the drone show happening above Tomorrowland. I believe it’s called Scarlet Skies. Super cool if you’re a Marvel fan! 

**20:00 -** Checked into the viewing area for Momentous - separate roped off section in front of people who were probably waiting for at least an hour. I personally think the package was worth it so we didn’t have to stand shoulder to shoulder with everyone else while waiting for the show. About every 5 minutes there was a pre-show castle projection change with some music relating to the different princesses. As the show gets closer they ask everyone to remain standing and you cannot sit on the floor. There is still plenty of room to move around the reserved area so you don't feel crowded.

**20:30** \- Momentous was a fantastic nighttime show. Great mix of castle and water projections, lasers, and fireworks. Great song choices and visual effects.

**21:00** \- Main Street stores were still open for a little bit after Momentous - we got most of our souvenirs here before heading back to the hotel so we could start packing them. After about an hour or so post-show, they start to section off the store to encourage everyone to exit the park. Super long wait for Explorer’s Lodge hotel shuttle! 

**22:30** \- Arrived back at Explorer’s Lodge and set down our stuff. Explored the lobby and gardens. Wrote some post cards for family back home.

# Wednesday 5/14

**07:40** \- Purchased Early Entry, checked out of room, dropped off luggage, and headed to breakfast buffet.

**08:00** \- Breakfast buffet at Dragon Wind. Great selection of Chinese dim sum and American classics like waffles, sausage, and fruit. There is also a cereal station and yogurt to choose from. 

**08:45** \- Took pictures with Explorer Goofy and headed to the park via hotel shuttle.

**09:15** \- Went through Early Entry security and waited to enter main gate. 

**09:30** \- Entered park and headed straight for World of Frozen. Many guests stopped to take pictures at the train station and Main Street so there weren’t too many people rushing towards Frozen! We waved and said good morning to all Cast Members welcoming us in. They appreciate the gesture! (Speaking as a former CM hehe)

**09:45** \- Walked right onto Wandering Oakens Sliding Sleighs. Going through the queue took longer than the actual ride lol! Very short roller coaster but we are glad it was virtually no wait. 

**10:00** \- Walked onto Frozen Ever After. Again no wait, just walked through the queue and the ride was very enjoyable in the A/C. We went about three more times just to get it out of our system before normal park opening crowds came in.

**11:00** \- Winnie the Pooh twice with no wait. Would have loved to do Mickey’s Philharmagic if it wasn’t closed! 

**11:30** \- Toy Storyland for Parachute Drop + Slinky Dog \~ 15min each. 

**12:00** \- Enjoyed some more Dole Whip :)

Managed to get a standby pass for Playhouse in the Woods for 12:25-12:40. Shopped around while waiting. 

**12:30** \- Playhouse in the Woods. Line was crowded after check-in but the A/C inside was worth it. Storytelling was nice but I think this experience is more suitable for families with young kids. We personally wouldn't do again but glad we tried it!

**13:00** \- Got caramel popcorn and decided to queue up for Mickey and the Wondrous Book showing at 13:45.

**13:45** \- Mickey and the Wondrous Book was an great show! Reminded me a lot of the Aladdin show back in California Adventure. Lots of good songs and sitting in A/C for almost 30 minutes was amazing. 

*\* Tip: for English subtitles sit on the right side of the theater. Characters speak in Cantonese for the storytelling but the songs are in English. Chinese subtitles on the left side. \**

**14:30** \- Lunch at Starliner Diner. Hulk Double Burger was good but the Iron Man Wagyu Burger bun was very dense. The Spiderman Prawn Burger was much better.

**15:45** \- Antman and the Wasp to let us digest lunch. 10 min wait.

**16:15** \- Got coffee at Main Street Market House (Starbucks) and picked up the Duffy & Friends souvenir re-usable cup. No mugs available for purchase. They gave out samples of the pink drink which was nice and refreshing!

**16:30** \- Went to City Hall to drop off post cards. No postage needed for Disney post cards - included with purchase :)

**16:45** \- Jungle Cruise \~20min for English tour

**17:30** \- Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars \~20min

**18:15** \- Walked through Mystic Point and Toy Storyland for last minute souvenirs for the area

**18:30** \- Planned to take the train back to main entrance but it had ended its operation for the day. Also I believe Fantasyland station is for alighting only! At DL in California you can board at any station so this was different for us.

**19:00** \- Walked down Main Street, exited the gate, and picked up merch that was delivered via package express. 

**19:30** \- Shuttle to Hollywood Hotel for dinner reservation at The Archivist.

**20:00** \- Dinner at the Archivist. Awesome Marvel theming and food selection! Thank you u/kheetkhat for recommending the Ragnarok Medley. It was ***divine***. We also ordered a limited time dessert option called “Sweet Delights, Assemble” which was a nice treat at the end. The drinks were stellar and the atmosphere was pleasant. 

**22:00** \- Walked back to Explorer’s Lodge to pick up luggage and grabbed a taxi back to Ho Man Tin.

  
*On a different day after going to Ngong Ping, we decided to stop by the Archivist again for dinner.*

We got the Gems Platter, Killer Good Bites, Quantum Burgers, and Asgardian Cheat Day. We went a little overboard this time around but everything was still amazing. Drinks were fantastic as always.

# Plot Twist - Bonus content if you read this far lol

We were so bummed that Mystic Manor was closed the days we went to the park. However.. our flight back home was at 18:45 on May 20 (the day Mystic Manor was scheduled to re-open)... so we booked one more day and did Early Entry for one last run of HKDL :)

We got up early and took a taxi to the park with all our bags packed and ready to be stored at the luggage storage. We went through Early Entry security and were in the park at 09:30. We mainly did this to skip the normal security line.

We re-did Frozen Ever After, Iron Man, Grizzly Gulch Runaway Mine Cars, Toy Story Land for the Dole Whip, and ***finally*** got to ride Mystic Manor. It is honestly my favorite ride in the whole park and maybe even throughout *all* the Disney Parks I've visited. We rode it about 3 times just to savor every last bit of HKDL before we had to leave for the airport. We ended up doing a half day at the park from 09:30 to 14:30. At the airport, we shuffled luggage and backpack contents from our park gear and showered at the lounge before our flight to LA.

Overall it was worth it to go an extra day for us personally but others might not think it necessary just for experiencing one 'new' ride. :P

We had a blast this trip and immediately wanted to go back once we left Disney property. Lots of nostalgia and good memories. HKDL is much smaller than DLR/DCA but it still has the charm and magic. We are considering getting Magic Keys for back home but we also hope to return to HKDL in the future! 



# TL;DR:

# 2 days to fully enjoy HKDL at a comfortable pace. 1 day is doable, better with Early Entry. Premier Access not necessary unless it's peak season. Dinner package was worth it for reserved Momentous viewing. Use Package Express service to send your purchases to Disney Hotel or front entrance and pick up after 3 hours. 

# Top attractions for us: Mystic Manor, Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Minecars, and Iron Man Experience. 

# Top entertainment offerings: Mickey and the Wondrous Book, Scarlet Skies, and Momentous (with reserved viewing especially). Would also include Festival of the Lion King but it wasn't showing during our visit.



# HONORABLE MENTION OUTSIDE OF PARK: Eat at the Archivist inside Hollywood Hotel. 10/10 food, drinks, and theme.

**Thought Experiment:**

If the Magarepublic party was planning and/or had successfully compromised American elections, they would:

\* Vote against funding for securing elections

\* Make it harder to vote, suppress voter turnout

\* Reduce paper trail / ballots / audits

\* Partner with foreign state actors who can help them get it done in exchange for favorable foreign policy and laundered payoffs

\* Accuse the other party of doing it to proactively hide their activity

\* Manufacture a disinformation campaign about invented fraud when they lose

\* Get caught tampering with election equipment and sharing its software illegally

\* Use it as kompromat to lock-in internal party loyalty and silence

\* Campaign and govern with zero concern for the votes of independents or Democratic voters

\* Consistently overperform against the polls

\* When in power, make unprecedented requests for voter and election data but do nothing to secure the system

I had been working for him so I’m currently looking for another job, likely in cannabis, but I don’t want to rely on work to make friends. It feels like that’s the only way I’ve established friendships since graduating high school and few have lasted once I/they leave the job. I really want to find other ways to meet people. 

I’m pretty shy and quiet and have always struggled to put myself out there. At the same time, I am really friendly and love meeting new people, it’s just scary to make the first move. 

I’m not into clubbing and have only been to a few dive bars, mostly in the valley where I live. I love thrifting, trying new foods and coffees/teas. I love nature when I’m able to venture out. I do smoke weed (not as much anymore though so I prob can’t keep up with most people lol). 

How are y’all making friends? I don’t need or expect to make a huge group of friends. I just wish I had like.. one girl friend here to hangout with and talk to. I’m about to turn 25 and I feel so pathetic and defeated that I struggle so much with this.

I told myself I didn’t need help. That I was too “functional” for sober living. Truth is, I was just too proud.

Eventually, pride gave way to humility and I moved into a sober living house.  
5 bedrooms. Shared space. Random chores. Mandatory testing. Expectations. Real structure. Real people.

I have bp2 and BPD, a really shitty combination. It makes it really hard for me to handle my finances and budget, I'm trying to get better and sort my life out but this part is what I reallyyyy struggle with.

I'm AWFUL at budgeting, so awful I've basically given up at it. I use whatever money I need and then I don't keep track of it. My savings account is pretty much my wallet, then I transfer money to the bank account I pay with. In short, I don't have an actual savings account. I recently realized how stupid this is and I'm determined to better myself.

I live alone so my expenses aren't that bad, my rent is around 406€/467$ with everything included except electricity. It's a good size apartment and I'm quite comfy, very local and kinda quiet.

My eating habits aren't great, I don't have a working appetite (chronic issue) and I don't cook, I'm scared of having food in the house cause I'm worried I'll binge eat it. My diet is reduced to protein shakes, coffee and cup noodles. I know it's not good, but I just lack interest in the whole food department.

I've looked into budgeting ""tutorials"" and tips, but I'm realizing the problem is that my brain doesn't work the same was as a neurotypical person's. I had a very bad retail therapy problem during my manic episodes, as well as impulse spending on new ""totally sustainable projects that I'll master on a whim."" I'll get super into getting my life together, ""I'm cured from my mental illness!"" Then depressive episode and my routine falls apart for a month or so.

TL;DR, I struggle with living economically, handling my income and my manic episodes often tie into impulse spending. I've improved significantly with meds, but I'm not quite there.

1lfjjlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NickelAllergy/comments/1lfjjlf/advice_for_adapting_to_low_nickel_diet/,advice for adapting to low nickel diet !,"Hi, I’ve just recently put two and two together with my nickel allergy and some physical symptoms I’ve been having and I’m feeling so overwhelmed reading about SNAS. 

I’ve known I have a contact nickel allergy since I was young, I got a bad rash from a belt and went to the dr who confirmed it was a nickel allergy, and I’ve always had to avoid any cheap jewelry. But i never realized you could have reactions from ingesting nickel somehow or that foods were so high in it. I stumbled across a post about nickel allergy a few weeks ago and saw that raspberries are very high in nickel. we have a large raspberry bush in our backyard and they’re ripening now so I’ve been eating a lot of them and noticing a lot of physical symptoms - acne/breakouts, swollen lymph nodes, throat swelling, stomach pain and diarrhea, etc. and that made me want to look into this more and Ive been reading the sub. Besides these symptoms I have a lot of other ones that other people have also described - eczema on eyelids and sometimes hands, fatigue, brain fog, joint pain, headaches, migraines, anxiety. as well as dry skin/hair, brittle nails. I’ve been attributing a lot of the mental stuff and headaches to my autism and adhd, (also have pmdd) and now I’m just very confused and not sure how big of a role my diet could be playing. Reading people’s comments I am going to try and pay more attention to my symptoms and keep track of what I’m eating, but reading about what foods people have had to cut out is making me so overwhelmed. I eat a mostly plant based diet, although I eat eggs, occasional fish, and have had to add back in turkey sandwiches as I don’t get enough protein normally. I am also lactose intolerant, and a huge portion of what I consume is on the foods to avoid lists. I think I will have to avoid raspberries for sure based on the symptoms worsening the last few weeks and raspberries being the difference recently. This is already a huge bummer, as raspberries are my favorite fruit, and really one of the only fruits I eat anymore. (I struggle with arfid and sometimes fruit is too risky if I don’t know if it will be good every time). and we have so many huge and really delicious ones. I am so sad about this :( 
oats and oat milk are a pretty huge part of what I eat. I eat a lot of granola with oats and seeds, and my non dairy milk is usually oat milk. just noticed this morning that having a few sips of oat milk coffee made my lymph nodes swell a bit more and I got a headache (this happens so often it can be hard to tell the source, but now I wonder how often it may be due to what i’m eating). dairy upsets my stomach and I don’t know what I’ll do about this if I can’t have alt milk. I also have a lot of protein shakes and smoothies with oat milk as I often have difficulty with executive functioning and cooking and I really need these easy things with protein. I also have a lot of nuts and peanut butter, soy, chickpeas, etc. and with all of those being on the lists as well as lentils and legumes I just don’t know how I can continue to eat plant based and get enough nutrition/protein if I have to cut these foods out. While I don’t love the idea of not eating plant based anymore for many reasons, if it made me feel a lot better I would be willing to change things and add some things back in, but I can’t have dairy, and I don’t like meat very much. I have texture issues with a lot of meat and do not like to handle it, so I’m not sure what I would even be able to add back in.  

I am still in the early stages of this and haven’t talked to a doctor about it yet. I definitely will be exploring this more on my own at least and working on eliminating things and figuring out what my biggest triggers are. I’m willing to make some changes to see if it makes things better, and avoiding my worst triggers, but right now I’m really struggling to imagine how I am going to deal with this, and what I am going to be able to eat. Almost everything I eat is not recommended, and all vegan/non dairy alts are made from nuts or soy or coconut. not to mention the things that bring me joy like coffee, tea, chocolate (!!) etc. :( It’s taken me a long time to find safe foods and just to have enough things in the day that I actually want to eat. I don’t really enjoy cooking at all and already have difficulty with preparing all of my meals even though they are very easy. I know I may be overreacting or getting a little ahead of myself but I’m feeling very discouraged about it right now, I almost don’t want to try an elimination diet for fear of what I may find out, and even if I just try out a low nickel diet for a while I’m not even sure what i’ll eat :( I am going to try more vitamin c and zinc based on some people’s recommendations and see if that helps. if you have any other advice or recommendations/meal ideas, or how you deal with audhd + nickel allergy it would be much appreciated! thank you in advance ",2,1750360885.0,NickelAllergy,1,1.0,False
1lfjjfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1lfjjfn/my_body_has_betrayed_me/,My body has betrayed me.,"Im a FTM, 29 weeks

For the past few days, I’ve been having cramps? horrible tummy pain. It feels like I’m about to shit my guts out; has me crying, rolling around on the floor trying to find a comfortable position to relieve the pain.  
I tried a hot bath, tens unit, walking, sitting still, going potty, sobbing, and making a blood sacrifice to any god who will listen. 

Of course I’m thinking the worst- baby is coming. I time the “cramptractions” and they are strange. They follow no pattern, don’t last any consistent amount of time, and I don’t feel pressure or anything. At this point, I’m anxious, and in PAIN. Quick tally of my symptoms: no bleeding, no discharge, strange cramps following no pattern at all, baby is moving just fine, feeling like I need to poop, but just passing gas. Oh- and when I felt crampy, my tummy would be soft, not hard at all. 🧐

I called the nurse line at this point, concerned. Do I need to go get checked out? She didn’t seem worried. She wanted me to rest, drink a ton of water, take some tylenol and go to bed. I do as directed, and wake up this morning, with the same symptoms, but add in sweats and shits. At this point, I’m racking my brain (and Reddit) to find what I need to do. Of course I have anxiety, and have a history of running to the hospital when I don’t have anything medically wrong. I don’t want to spend $$$ just to be told I’m fine. Everything I see is telling me to go get checked out- it might be preterm labor, but my gut is telling me something else is happening. Baby is moving fine, my tummy is soft during this cramps, etc. and this pain feels…familiar? 

It was at this point I realised- my lactose intolerance has come back. 😭 A quick Reddit search confirmed my suspicions- multiple other women have their lactose tolerance disappear at the beginning of the third trimester, and I had a big bowl of leftover birthday cake (with pudding and whipped cream, and dairy galore) last night. 

I have had a blissful 7 months eating as much ice cream, alfredo, and cheese as I want. I will miss my morning coffee with cream, or cottage cheese and fruit. I got through my birthday with a lovely cake-pudding trifle dish, but now it kicking me in the ass. I had a good run, and now the runs 😞. 

Why couldn’t my body just give me a pop up notification that I’ve reached my dairy limit? Why did I have to go through this horrific pain and anxiety just to realise I can’t drink milk? Why can’t I just be disinterested in dairy? Why would my body betray me and my son like this??

Pray for me- my gas pains haven’t left, and I feel like I’m dying. I hope by the end of the day the dairy leaves my system, and I can go back to normal back pain, swollen legs, and fatigue. ",3,1750360876.0,pregnant,3,1.0,False
1lfjjeu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lfjjeu,The Ghost of Sligo: Who Was Peter Bergmann and Why Did He Erase Himself?,"Yo r/mystery, I’ve been down a rabbit hole with this one, and it’s hands-down one of the creepiest unsolved cases I’ve ever come across. Picture this: a guy shows up in a small Irish town, seems totally normal, then poof, he’s gone, leaving no clue who he really was. This is the Peter Bergmann case, and it’s been baffling cops, internet sleuths, and true crime nerds since 2009. I’ve dug through every source I could find to make sure this is legit, no BS rumors or wild theories without backup. Grab a coffee, ‘cause this one’s gonna keep you up at night. Let’s make this go viral and maybe crack it open

In June 2009, a dude calling himself Peter Bergmann rolls into Sligo, a sleepy coastal town in northwest Ireland. He’s got grey hair, glasses, a slight build, and a thick German accent. On June 12, he hops off a bus from Derry at 6:28 PM, carrying a black shoulder bag and a beat-up luggage bag. He takes a taxi to the Sligo City Hotel, checks in for three nights, pays cash, and gives a fake address: Ainstettersn 15, 4472, Vienna, Austria. Spoiler: that address doesn’t exist. It’s a vacant lot.

Over the next few days, this guy’s acting weird. He’s caught on CCTV leaving the hotel 13 times, always with a purple plastic bag stuffed with something. Every time he comes back, the bag’s empty. Cops think he’s dumping his stuff around town, but they never found that bag or what was in it. He’s super careful, dodging cameras like he knows where they are, using blind spots to stay off the grid. On June 13, he buys eight 82-cent stamps and airmail stickers at the post office probably mailed something, but no one knows what or to who.

On June 15, he checks out, leaves his room key and a “Do Not Disturb” sign, and heads to the bus station. He’s seen grabbing a cappuccino and a sandwich, then heads to Rosses Point Beach, a scenic spot nearby. Next morning, June 16, around 6 AM, a dad and his son, Arthur and Brian Kinsella, spot a body on the beach while training for a triathlon. At first, they think it’s a mannequin, but nope it’s a guy, dead, washed up on the shore. It’s our man, Peter Bergmann.

Here’s where it gets freaky. The guy’s got no ID. Zero. All the labels on his clothes jacket, pants, even his underwear are cut off. He’s wearing a navy T-shirt, purple-striped Speedo trunks, and regular undies over them (weird, right?). His other stuff, a black C&A jacket, navy chinos, a Tommy Hilfiger jumper, dark socks, and size 44 Finn Comfort shoes from Germany is neatly folded nearby. No wallet, no keys, nothing to say who he is. In his pockets? Just some cash, tissues, aspirin, bandages, and a bar of hotel soap that’s not even from Ireland.

The autopsy says he drowned, no signs of foul play. But here’s the kicker: he had advanced prostate cancer, bone tumors, only one kidney, and signs of past heart attacks. Dude was sick, like really sick. No drugs in his system, though, so it wasn’t an OD. His fingerprints and DNA? No matches in any database, not even Interpol. The name Peter Bergmann? Doesn’t exist in Europe, America, or South America for anyone matching his description, 50s or 60s, 5’9”, slim, grey hair, blue eyes, gold tooth, well-groomed.

So, who was this guy? Why Sligo? Why go through all this trouble to erase himself? Here’s what people are saying:

Terminally Ill Guy: Most likely, he knew he was dying from cancer and heart issues and wanted to go out on his terms, no trace left behind. Maybe he picked Sligo for its quiet beauty, thinking the tide would carry his body away (it didn’t). The cold Atlantic water (13°C that day) could’ve triggered a heart attack, especially with his health.

Fugitive or Spy: Some think he was a criminal or ex-intelligence guy on the run, super methodical about covering his tracks. His camera-dodging skills and label-cutting scream someone who’s done this before. But no evidence backs this up, no criminal record or spy connections.

Nazi Connection: A wilder theory says he might’ve been the kid of a Nazi criminal, hiding his past. Total speculation, no proof.

Just a Lost Soul: Maybe he was just a lonely guy with no family, wanting to disappear quietly. The stamps suggest he might’ve mailed a final goodbye, but we’ll never know.

Detective Inspector Ray Mulderrig, who worked the case, said, “Everything he did seemed to have a purpose. The question is: why Sligo? You’re spoiled for choice on Ireland’s west coast for scenic places to die.

This guy was a ghost before he even died. He didn’t talk to anyone, no chit-chat at the hotel, no phone calls, no meetings caught on camera. He avoided CCTV like a pro, which makes you wonder if he had training. The purple bag thing? He dumped its contents 13 times, and cops searched everywhere, trash bins, parks, even the local dump and found nothing. Then there’s the stamps. Did he send letters to someone? A confession? A farewell? And why cut every single label off his clothes? That’s next-level commitment to staying unknown.

Oh, and get this: no one ever came looking for him. Not a single person reported a missing guy matching his description. He was buried in an unmarked grave in Sligo Cemetery on September 18, 2009, with just six people there, cops, the undertaker, and the gravedigger. His DNA’s still on file, waiting for a match that might never come

This isn’t just about a body on a beach. It’s about a guy who planned his exit so carefully, he left nothing behind, no name, no past, no closure. Was he running from something? Protecting someone? Or just done with life? The fact that he pulled it off in a small town covered in CCTV is wild. Sligo’s not exactly a metropolis, yet he outsmarted everyone. And those stamps,what’d he write, and who got it

I’m dying to hear your takes. Ever heard of this case? It’s been on The Last Days of Peter Bergmann (2013 documentary, check it out), Irish Times stories, and a ton of Reddit threads. Could he have been a spy? A guy saying goodbye to a life no one knew about? Or something totally out there? If you’re in Ireland, maybe you’ve got local gossip from Sligo or Derry.

1lfjh9i,https://i.redd.it/kxskh5uyox7f1.png,Best Mid Century Modern Living Room Furniture Combos That Actually Work,"If you’re looking to create a mid century modern living room that makes you feel both stylish and welcoming, it’s important to find furniture pieces that work well together. Mid century modern design is all about clean lines, natural wood tones, and timeless shapes — but mixing these elements can be tricky if you don’t know where to start. The good news? You don’t have to buy everything at once or spend a fortune. Affordable mid century modern furniture can help you build a space that looks polished and cozy.

Here are some simple but effective combos to get your mid century modern home looking sharp:



**1. Oregon Beige Sofa + Noak Coffee Table + Penny Leather Lounge Chair**

Begin with a neutral sofa like the[ Oregon Sofa in Beige](https://midinmod.com/products/oregon-sofabeige). Its soft color and smooth lines make it a perfect foundation for any mid century modern interior. Next, add the[ Noak Coffee Table](https://midinmod.com/products/noak-coffee-table), which has classic tapered legs and a warm wooden surface — great for balancing the light sofa. Finally, the[ Penny Leather Lounge Chair](https://midinmod.com/products/penny-leather-lounge-chair-tan-genuine-leather) adds texture and warm tone that complements the rest of the room. The leather ages beautifully and brings a sophisticated edge.



**2. Noak Solid Wood TV Stand + Marko End Table + Sislo Ottoman**

If you want a functional and stylish corner, the[ Noak TV Stand](https://midinmod.com/products/noak-solid-wood-tv-stand) fits perfectly with its clean, solid wood design. Pair it with the rounded[ Marko End Table](https://midinmod.com/products/marko-solid-wood-end-table) for added warmth and shape contrast.

**3. Mid Century Modern Floor Lamp + Colorful Rug + Green Plants**

Good lighting changes everything. A tall mid century modern floor lamp adds height and style to your living room. Pick one with wood or brass details for extra warmth. Layer the floor with a colorful rug featuring simple patterns or earth tones. This adds personality without overwhelming the space. Finally, bring in some greenery like snake plants or fiddle leaf figs — they add freshness and soften the hard edges of your furniture.

**Final Thoughts**

Building a mid century modern living room is about mixing textures, colors, and shapes in a way that feels natural. Affordable mid century modern furniture can look high-end when you choose pieces that complement each other. Start with a great sofa or chair, add a functional coffee table and lighting, and don’t forget accessories like rugs and plants to complete your space. The right combos make your home feel warm, stylish, and truly yours.

1lfjamo,https://www.reddit.com/r/MetroStories/comments/1lfjamo/metro_meetup/,Metro Meetup,"Hyderabad lo, metro rail lo start ayyindi ee katha. Morning 8:30 AM, Ameerpet station lo usual rush. Chai stalls smell, office-goers hustle, and inka konchem chaos. Andulo, Sid, 26, software engineer, earphones lo lo-fi beats tho, platform meeda wait chestunnadu. Typical urban Telugu yuvakudu – cool, but inside konchem reserved. T-shirt, jeans, backpack, and a coffee cup in hand. Metro vachindi, doors open ayinappudu, he spots her – Ananya.

Ananya, 24, graphic designer, Shekhar Kammula heroine vibe. Simple kurti, jhumkas, and a sketchbook in hand. Her smile? It’s like Banjara Hills breeze, fresh and warm. Sid notices her, but avaniki dare undadhu. Just a quick glance, then back to his phone. Metro lo seat dorikindi, Ananya opposite side lo kurchundi. Sid’s eyes accidentally meet hers. She smiles lightly. Avanu heart skip ayyindi.

**Sid (inner monologue):** ""Enti idi? Smile ichindi, just casual ga ani anukovala? Overthink cheyyaku Sid, chill.""

Next day, same time, same metro. Ananya inko page sketch chestu undi. Sid, this time, courage gather chesi, “Nice sketches,” ani casual ga antadu.

**Ananya (smiling):** ""Thanks! Just timepass. Work lo bore kodithe, ide therapy.""

**Sid:** ""Haha, naku kuda music therapy. Software lo bugs fix chestu untam kada, adi relief.""

Small talk start ayyindi. Ameerpet to Hitech City, 20 minutes journey lo, they talk about Hyderabad traffic, filter coffee, and Charminar night vibes. Ananya’s energy is infectious – she’s witty, unapologetically herself, and has that spark. Sid, reserved ga unna, slowly open avuthunnadu.

**Ananya:** ""Nuvvu eppudu intha silent ga untavu, bro? Konchem life undali kada?""

**Sid (laughs):** ""Life undi, just... show cheyyadam nerchukoledu.""

Weeks pass, ee metro meetups regular ayyayi. Sid’s playlist lo Ananya ki kuda space dorikindi – she suggests AR Rahman’s old tracks. They share earphones one day, “Nenjukkule” play avuthu undaga, their fingers brush. Sid’s heart races, but he plays it cool. Ananya blushes, but acts like nothing happened.

**Ananya (teasing):** ""Oho, Sid, blush ayipoyava? Cool dude ani buildup ichav kada!""

**Sid (nervous laugh):** ""Arre, blush enti? AC lo chali.""

Innocent moments build up. Coffee shops lo meet avutharu, Gachibowli food trucks lo biryani share chestharu. Sid feels something new, but he’s scared. “Is this just friendship? Nenu overthink chestunnana?” he wonders. Ananya’s openness makes him question his walls.

But, misunderstanding enters. One day, Ananya’s friend, Vikram, joins their metro ride. Sid sees them laughing, and his insecurities kick in. Vikram’s all charm, and Sid feels like he’s no match. He starts pulling back, replies dull avuthayi, meetups cancel chestadu.

**Ananya (texting):** ""Sid, enti matter? Sudden ga ghosting start chesav?""

**Sid (typing, then deleting):** ""Nothing, just busy.""

Sid’s self-doubt peaks. “Nenu enough kadu emo. She deserves someone outgoing, like Vikram,” he thinks. Ananya, hurt by his distance, stops texting. Metro rides feel empty. Sid’s playlist feels incomplete without her song suggestions.

One evening, Banjara Hills lo, rain pouring, Sid spots Ananya at a chai stall, sketching alone. He gathers courage, walks up.

**Sid:** ""Ananya, sorry. Nenu... konchem messed up. Vikram tho nuvvu happy ga unte, nenu disturb cheyyakudadu ani anukunna.""

**Ananya (surprised):** ""Vikram? He’s just a friend, Sid! Nuvvu enduku intha assume chestav? I missed our talks, you know.""

**Sid (vulnerable):** ""Naku bayam. I’m not good at this... feelings stuff. But nuvvu leni ee weeks, something’s missing.""

Ananya smiles, that same warm smile. “Sid, you don’t need to be perfect. Just be you. That’s enough.”

Rain slows down, they share chai. Sid opens up about his fears, his reserved nature. Ananya listens, her eyes soft. They laugh about their silly metro moments, the earphone-sharing day, the biryani fights. Slowly, trust builds.

Months later, they’re at Necklace Road, fairy lights glowing. Sid’s not the same reserved guy. He’s still quiet, but now he shares his thoughts. Ananya’s still the spark, but she’s learned to give him space. They’re not just a couple; they’re growing together, like Hyderabad’s skyline – chaotic, beautiful, and always evolving.

**Ananya (playful):** ""Sid, metro lo first smile eppudu icha, appudu fix ayipoyava?""

**Sid (grinning):** ""Fix ayipoya ani cheppalenu, but... ninnu chusi playlist update chesa.""

They laugh, Hyderabad’s night lights reflecting in their eyes.

Today I went to a new coffee shop to treat myself to lunch. I walk in and immediately am hit Staind “it’s been a while”; barista singing along and all. Little did I know I was gonna be hit with a five-peat of legendary stinkers. 

I got a slight reprieve with some STP song (name escapes me), only to be hit with the bloated downpour that is “November Rain”. Once “slow Kryptonite” started after that, I realized there was no hope and slammed what was left of my coffee and sandwich so I could get the hell outta there. Unfortunately, I wasn’t quick enough, and was treated to the first 90 seconds of “Shine” - yeahs and all - as my parting gift.

Some men intentionally shoulder-check women in public as a form of antisocial behavior.

It reminded me of something that happened to my wife in downtown Vancouver a few months ago. She and a female coworker were walking to grab coffee when an ordinary looking man, walking fast down the sidewalk, deliberately shoulder-checked her right in the chest and just kept going without a word. She even stepped slightly to the side when she saw him coming, so it wasn't accidental. Both of them were stunned, but thankfully she was okay. She was just really confused when it happened and said it hurt.

In June of 2021, my mom suffered an aortic aneurysm which lead her to getting emergency heart surgery. At this time, myself, my autistic younger brother, and her were homeless and living in a hotel so that we had a roof over our heads. Also sperm donor not in pic cause he left when I was 18 but relevant to story. 

Thats where everything starts go downhill. After her surgery, she was in the ICU and I visited almost everyday. Literally taking unpaid leave and to the point of losing my health insurance too (I worked in a coffee kiosk at a grocery store). I also have 4 older half siblings who were semi nearby but none of them visited. I was the only who stayed almost 6 hours everyday in my mom’s icu room, no eating, no drinking. Just sitting there. I ended up having going back to work since now it was going to be me to pay for the hotel room and all of our necessities. 

When I tried asking for help, one of my sisters called me a brat, because it wasn’t her problem. My mental health started getting worse and I was eating less and less. I eventually met my fiancé during this time because I was lonely and he helped me a ton (but that story is for a different time). My sperm donor wasn’t budging either on helping his own kids especially his autistic son because my mom shouldve apparently that a long time ago

My mom eventually got sort of better and was able to move to a nursing home. That’s when all the financial trauma began too. She was able to get SSI but instead of giving some to me to help pay for me and my brother to stay the hotel, she used it to DoorDash food because she didn’t like the food at the nursing home. Plus there was also a car she made me get from a used car dealership and I was stuck with almost a 10k car loan but I was able to work out a deal with the owner of the dealership.  

She got discharged from the nursing home back to the hotel and I had to take care of her while also working almost a 40 hr work week and keeping a roof over our head. She moved back to the nursing home but went back to her same old ways of DoorDash ing food. My fiancé and I were just fed up with it because she wanted to put everything on me because she knows I’m a people pleaser and very gullible (I grew out of it thankfully) but there was also my younger brother and trying to get him into a group home because I knew I couldn’t take care of him. I eventually moved in with my fiancé and with the help of him eventually started on my healing journey. 

I then went no contact with her and most of my family because I needed to heal and grow. But the nursing home she’s at contacted me about her care conference even though I told them not to contact me about her. 

Although I’m going through therapy and other mental health support, does this make me a bad daughter for going no contact with my sick mom?",9,1750360037.0,EstrangedAdultKids,2,1.0,False

1lfj4hj,https://i.redd.it/muywt02fmx7f1.jpeg,This HP Omen 16 with RTX 5070 Just Made Me Question Everything I Thought I Knew About Gaming Laptops,"Okay, let's talk about something that's been keeping me up at night – and no, it's not my caffeine addiction this time. It's this **HP Omen 16 AI VR Ready Gaming Laptop** that landed on my desk, and honestly? It's got me rethinking my entire relationship with portable gaming.

You know that feeling when you think you've got everything figured out, and then something comes along that just... changes the game? That's exactly what happened when I fired up this beast with its **Intel Core Ultra 9 285H** and **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070**.

# Why This Laptop Made Me Do a Double-Take

Look, I've been around the gaming laptop block more times than I care to admit. I've seen the good, the bad, and the ""why-did-they-even-bother"" ugly. But this HP Omen 16? It's sitting in a category that I didn't even know existed until now.

**Here's what caught my attention immediately:**

* **16.1"" WQXGA IPS display** running at a buttery smooth **240Hz**
* **Intel Core Ultra 9 285H processor** (yeah, that's the new hotness)
* **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070** with 8GB GDDR7 VRAM
* **16GB RAM** paired with a **1TB SSD**
* **RGB backlit keyboard** because, let's be honest, we all need our pretty lights :)

The moment I lifted this thing out of its box, I knew I was dealing with something different. The **Shadow Black** finish isn't just another boring black laptop – it's got this subtle sophistication that screams ""I mean business"" without being obnoxious about it.

[Check out the latest pricing and availability](https://amzn.to/460baNS)

# The Display That Made Me Forget About My Desktop Monitor

Remember when 144Hz was considered the holy grail of gaming displays? Well, those days are officially over, my friend. This **240Hz WQXGA IPS panel** is what dreams are made of, and I'm not being dramatic here (okay, maybe a little).

# What Makes This Screen Special

The **2560 x 1600 resolution** hits that sweet spot between crisp detail and performance. It's not trying to be 4K and tank your frame rates – it's being smart about giving you **incredible clarity** without the compromise.

Ever tried gaming on a laptop screen that looked like it was borrowed from 2015? Yeah, this isn't that. The **IPS technology** means you're getting consistent colors whether you're sitting dead center or watching from the side (useful when your nosy roommate wants to see what you're playing).

**The 240Hz refresh rate** is where things get spicy. Playing competitive shooters on this thing feels like I've been gaming underwater my whole life, and someone just handed me gills. The **3ms response time** means your inputs actually register when you make them – revolutionary concept, right?

# Intel Core Ultra 9 285H: The Processor That Actually Impressed Me

FYI, I was skeptical about Intel's latest and greatest. We've all been through the ""revolutionary"" processor launches that turned out to be... well, not so revolutionary. But the **Core Ultra 9 285H** actually lives up to its hype, and I'm eating my words with a side of humble pie.

# Performance That Makes Sense

This isn't just about raw numbers (though those are pretty sweet too). It's about **16 cores** that actually know what they're doing. **6 performance cores** handle the heavy lifting while **10 efficiency cores** take care of background tasks without breaking a sweat.

What really got me was the **multi-threading performance**. Running streaming software, Discord, Chrome with 47 tabs open (don't judge), and a AAA game simultaneously? No problem. This processor just shrugs and asks ""what's next?""

The **integrated graphics** on this chip are surprisingly capable too. Not ""ditch your RTX 5070"" capable, but good enough that you won't cry if you forget your charger and need to game on battery power.

# RTX 5070: The GPU That Justified My Excitement

Let me be real with you – the **RTX 5070** is the star of this show, and it knows it. **8GB of GDDR7 VRAM** means you're not going to hit memory walls anytime soon, and the performance boost over the previous generation is nothing short of impressive.

# Real-World Gaming Performance

**Cyberpunk 2077** with ray tracing? Smooth as butter at high settings. **Call of Duty** at 240fps to match that gorgeous display? Done. **Baldur's Gate 3** looking absolutely stunning while maintaining playable frame rates? Check.

But here's what really sold me on this GPU – it's not just about today's games. This thing is **VR ready** and **AI optimized**, which means it's thinking about tomorrow's gaming landscape, not just trying to catch up with yesterday's.

# The Design Details That Actually Matter

# Build Quality That Doesn't Suck

I've used laptops that felt like they were held together with hopes and prayers. This isn't one of them. The **Shadow Black** aluminum construction feels solid without being unnecessarily heavy. At **2.69 kg (5.9 lbs)**, it's substantial enough to feel premium but not so heavy that you'll need a chiropractor after carrying it around.

# RGB Done Right

The **RGB backlit keyboard** deserves special mention because it's not trying too hard. You can make it a rainbow disco if that's your thing, or keep it classy with single-color backlighting. The keys have actual **travel** and **tactile feedback** – imagine that!

**Port selection** is surprisingly thoughtful:

* Multiple USB-A ports (because we still live in the real world)
* USB-C with power delivery
* HDMI 2.1 for external displays
* Ethernet port (wired connection master race)
* Audio jack that doesn't sound like garbage

# The AI Integration That's Not Just Marketing Fluff

Here's where things get interesting. The **AI VR Ready** designation isn't just HP trying to jump on every tech buzzword bandwagon. The **Intel Core Ultra 9 285H** has a dedicated **NPU (Neural Processing Unit)** that handles AI workloads efficiently.

# What This Means for Gaming

**DLSS 3** and **Frame Generation** work beautifully with the RTX 5070, giving you performance boosts that feel like cheating (but legal cheating). The AI upscaling makes lower resolutions look better than they have any right to, and the frame generation creates smooth gameplay even in demanding scenarios.

**Content creation** benefits too. Video editing, streaming, and even AI-assisted photo editing run smoother thanks to the dedicated AI processing power.

# Memory and Storage: Finally, Enough Space

**16GB of RAM** might seem standard now, but it's **DDR5** running at proper speeds. No more stuttering when you have multiple applications open, no more closing Chrome tabs to free up memory for games (though you probably should anyway).

The **1TB SSD** is fast enough that loading screens become coffee break opportunities rather than bathroom breaks. Game installations are snappy, and the overall system responsiveness is exactly what you'd expect from a premium gaming laptop.

# Real Talk: What Could Be Better?

IMO, no laptop is perfect, and this one has a few quirks worth mentioning:

**Battery life** while gaming is... well, it's a gaming laptop. You're not going to get 8 hours of Cyberpunk 2077, but that's physics, not poor design. For productivity tasks, you can squeeze out decent battery life.

**Fan noise** under load is present but not obnoxious. It's the sound of performance, and honestly, if you're gaming with headphones, you won't even notice.

**Price point** puts it firmly in the premium category. This isn't a budget gaming laptop, and it doesn't pretend to be.

[See current deals and pricing](https://amzn.to/460baNS)

# The VR Ready Factor: Future-Proofing Done Right

Ever wondered why VR laptops often feel like compromises? This one doesn't. The **RTX 5070** has enough horsepower to drive **VR headsets** without making you lower settings to ""potato"" quality.

I tested it with a **Quest 3** via **Meta Link**, and the experience was seamless. No stuttering, no weird artifacts, just smooth VR gaming that actually worked as advertised.

# Who Should Buy This Beast?

This laptop makes sense for:

* **Serious gamers** who want desktop-level performance in a portable package
* **Content creators** who need AI-assisted workflows
* **VR enthusiasts** who don't want to be tethered to a desk
* **Students** who need a machine that can handle both work and play (if you can swing the budget)

# Final Thoughts: Is It Worth Your Hard-Earned Cash?

Look, I'll be straight with you – this **HP Omen 16 AI VR Ready Gaming Laptop** isn't just another gaming laptop with fancy marketing. It's a legitimate powerhouse that delivers on its promises.

The **Intel Core Ultra 9 285H** and **RTX 5070** combo creates a gaming experience that feels next-gen without the next-gen price of desktop components. The **240Hz display** is gorgeous, the build quality is solid, and the AI features actually add value instead of just checking boxes.

Sure, it's not cheap, but considering what you're getting – **premium performance**, **future-ready features**, and **build quality** that doesn't make you wince – it's competitive in the high-end gaming laptop space.

Would I recommend it? If you're looking for a gaming laptop that can handle today's games at high settings and tomorrow's VR experiences without breaking a sweat, then yeah, absolutely. This thing delivers, and it does it with style.

The **Shadow Black** finish, **RGB lighting**, and overall design aesthetic means you won't be embarrassed pulling this out in public, and the performance means you won't be embarrassed by your frame rates either.

Bottom line: HP knocked it out of the park with this one, and my desktop is starting to feel a little jealous :/

Since January, ICE has quietly revoked ""sensitive location"" protections, showing up at schools, hospitals, places of worship, courthouses, even traffic stops—and detaining not just undocumented immigrants but sometimes legal residents and U.S.-born children too. In Los Angeles alone, over 330 people were rounded up in coordinated raids that included National Guard and Marines, forcing vendors and entire neighborhoods into hiding.

Operation Safeguard has already resulted in 23,000 arrests across major U.S. cities, and the Trump admin has authorized ICE to deport up to 3,000 people a day—specifically zeroing in on sanctuary cities like LA, New York, and Chicago. Meanwhile, family detention facilities have reopened, with some detainees—including toddlers—being held for weeks under questionable legal authority.

We're talking about families being ripped apart not just at the border, but in their communities—moms at the grocery store, kids at school, dads picking up coffee. In Colorado, a university student was arrested just after a routine traffic stop thanks to info shared over law-enforcement Signal chats.

Joe and his guests have often challenged unchecked authority and government overreach. This feels like a serious authoritarian lever being pulled.

Not long ago, I found myself sitting by the window, coffee in hand, sunlight quietly slipping across the living room floor. Nothing remarkable had happened that day—no big news, no celebrations, no chaos. Just stillness. Just a lukewarm drink, a view of the world outside, and a moment that somehow felt… full.

That’s when it struck me — this is life.

Not just the achievements, the milestones, or the thrilling chapters we often highlight. Life is mostly what happens in between. It’s the pages we skip over while waiting for something ""bigger.""

# The Life Hidden in the Everyday

In a world that constantly chases the extraordinary, it’s easy to overlook what’s right in front of us. Social media celebrates our highlight reels — the grand trips, promotions, weddings, and sunset selfies. But when life gets quiet, and we sit alone with our memories, what comes to mind is often different.

It’s the little things.

The sound of your mother humming in the kitchen. The warmth of a shared meal with people you love. A casual evening walk. Nothing dramatic. Nothing viral. Just the soft echoes of life, playing in the background.

Author Annie Dillard once said, *""How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.""* It's a gentle reminder that the fabric of our existence is woven not from the loud moments, but from the ones we barely notice.

# Seeing What We Usually Miss

We’re often so focused on the big picture that we miss the details. We look ahead to vacations, dream jobs, or some ideal version of happiness. But what if peace isn’t something you find later? What if it’s right here — in the smell of breakfast on a slow Sunday or in the way the evening light spills across your floor?

I’ve started paying closer attention to those overlooked moments. The more I notice them, the more I realize: they hold more weight than I ever imagined.

# The Key Is Presence

Noticing these moments doesn’t require a new lifestyle — just a shift in attention. And I’ll be honest, it’s not always easy. Most of us live in fast-forward. We think ahead, plan, scroll, and multitask even during dinner.

But presence, even in short bursts, changes everything.

I remember once going for a walk without my phone. No distractions — just the sidewalk, the breeze, and the scent of blooming jasmine. That walk wasn’t special by any external standard. But it was real. And it grounded me in a way no Instagram post ever could.

William Blake once wrote:  
*“To see a world in a grain of sand, and a heaven in a wildflower…”*  
That kind of depth isn’t reserved for poets. It’s something we can all access — if we’re willing to slow down.

# The Illusion of “More”

We’re taught to want more — more success, more adventure, more “meaning.” But in chasing more, we often miss what’s already enough.

I've been caught in that loop before — always reaching for the next thing, thinking it would finally bring contentment. But more often than not, I found myself feeling empty. Because in the rush, I had skipped the moments that could have sustained me.

# What Truly Stays With Us

When people talk about what they remember most — about lost loved ones, or days they wish they could relive — it’s usually not the spectacular events. It’s the quiet rituals. The ordinary days. The sound of someone’s laughter. The feeling of being home.

A friend once told me, *“The moments that don’t seem to matter much are usually the ones that matter most.”* I didn’t fully understand that then. Now I do.

Thornton Wilder, in *Our Town*, asked: *“Do any human beings ever realize life while they live it? Every, every minute?”*  
Maybe not every minute. But we can get better at trying.

# A Few Practices That Help

Here are a few small shifts that have helped me reconnect with the beauty of the everyday:

* **Pause more often**: Even five minutes of silence can reset your focus.
* **Turn routines into rituals**: Light a candle, savor your tea, say goodnight slowly.
* **Ask, “What’s beautiful about this moment?”**: You’ll be surprised how often there’s an answer.

The more I practice noticing, the less I feel like I need something else.

# Ordinary Is Not Ordinary

We look for meaning in big moments, forgetting that life is made mostly of small ones. The Tuesday afternoons. The sound of the fan. The gentle clatter of dishes after dinner.

Marcel Proust once wrote:  
*“The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.”*  
That’s the heart of it. New eyes. Fresh attention. A willingness to see again what we’ve stopped seeing.

So here’s to those tiny, quiet, beautiful pieces of life — the ones we often overlook, but never forget.",0,1750359602.0,AITAH,3,0.4,False

My kids and wife F(45) stayed home to have lunch and celebrate. We’ve been married for almost 15 years, and it’s safe to say she knows well what I like and don’t like.

While preparing breakfast, my wife went to get coffee and returned home with a small cake to cut with our kids and myself. When she pulled the cake out of the package, it was a Red Velvet Cheesecake. This is her favorite type of cake she’d been wanting to try the one from a local pastry shop for a minute now. She also pulled out a small container with slice of dark chocolate cake with strawberry toppings, which she knows I I love. 

When she pulled it out she proudly announced she bought the cheesecake since it was the only full one they had, and that she wanted to get the whole version of my cake but they only had slices. So she thought it best to buy the cheescake since everyone will enjoy it and bring me a slice of one I liked

Don’t get me wrong, I really appreciated the gesture. The cake is for everyone to eat after all including our 10 and 14 year old girls and while I don't love cheesecake I don't mind red velvet. But my face probably changed, and she immediately started asking if I was upset. I told her I loved it as best I could, but I guess I couldn’t help but feel and look a bit bummed and emotional.

She started making faces and getting annoyed, so I told her that I didn’t want her to feel like I was being ungrateful but I couldn’t help but feel bad that she got her favorite cake from the place she wanted to try rather than get something I actually liked. It wasn’t about the flavor but more the lack of thought behind the 
choice. Honestly, I think I wouldn’t have felt as bad or reacted that way if she hadn’t also got a slice of cake I liked which confirmed she knew exactly what I preferred.",132,1750359457.0,AITAH,356,0.76,False

Over the years I developed my recipe by trial and error adjusting grind and time up and down until I got something I liked. I never weighed anything. 

I have tried many boutique beans and just keep coming back to 8 O’clock Colombian Peaks medium roast. I find that to be at least as good as the boutique beans and a third of the cost. I hate dark roast and don’t understand why people like burnt beans. 

I measured the output of my grinder and it weighed as 27 grams. I know that is heavy compared to many recipes here. 

I use a flow control cap and fill to the brim of the Aeropress with 200°F water straight from my heated dispenser followed by 20 strokes stirring. 
For the experiment I dialed back the grind time and brewed with 20 grams of coffee which seems to be a popular formula. 

What I found is that the lighter throw gave the coffee an almost astringent quality on the tongue with a noticeable taste of (hulls?).  

I was looking forward to using less coffee but I have gone back to the old method. IIABDFI

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

William is obvious I don't think I have explain why he is evil being a childmurderer and all.

Before sotm came out we only knew that Henry made some bad mistakes that lead to a tragedy (a wound that he let bleed out). But after sotm oh boy... Not only did he abandon his friend (at least I assume he and Edvin were friends, since Edvin calls him ""hen"") at his lowest point when his wife and child died, his company was failing and his employees and friends leaving. He also participated in ruining Edvins life. I mean he backed out of the deal they had, or at least allowing William to back out of it, last second wich is one of the reasons why his company tanked. And then stealing/allowing William to steal all his creations including the house of his parents. I know they are ""obviously never going to tuch it"" but considering how simelar the house we see is to the little we see of Williams house I have my doubts. Even David's toys he let William take. Assuming that he knew ofc. If he didn't he what? Just never ask about the giant mansion on the proporty and the stuff inside it? Also treating his employees horrible there's no way he is not aware of how bad the working condition are at fazbears, if he doesn't then he is just a bad co ceo lol

Now Edvin. I'm just going to make a list here:
-not raising David 
-ignoring concern about the playground placement
  witch led to David's death (probably)
-not going to his sons second birthday party
-making coffee that sent someone to the hospital 
-making a childrens cereal with a toy inside     
 dangerous enough to paralise a dog 
-how he treated his employees 
What I mean by that is he literally didn't let people leave if they didn't complete theyr tasks (in the recycling center specificly wich must suck HARD bc it looked realy hot). Not fixing the elevator issues and leaving instructions very fague/disorganized even promoting Fiona to guess how to fix an issue in the dollie chace this probably led to some deaths since Fiona sounds very concerned every time you have to fix one.

Fiona is more complicated. The bad things she did in life are just allowing Edvin to do what he did. So not raising David and how he treated his employees. Though she did try to tell him to take one thing at a time so the workers had it easier.
But if we assume she actually possess m1 and it isn't just mimicking her then she straight up killed Arnold in the one ending and putting him and many other fazbear employees in harms way that ultimately killed all of them (if the secret ending is canon then only Arnold survives). Also forcing Edvin to repair m2 or at least trying to wich honestly is understandable since she believes it truly is her son, but is putting a lot of stress and grief on Edvin.",6,1750358944.0,fivenightsatfreddys,1,0.87,False

Innovation in the field is accelerating with new peptide therapies progressing through trials and becoming available on the market.

This post focuses on peptides that are designed for recovery and healing. These have the potential to be the biggest difference makers to your performance and training.

We’ll look at the peptides you should consider and how to design an effective protocol for each.

# Recovery & Healing Peptides

This subset of peptides is one of the most popular, given their touted performance and physical health benefits. Reports of people avoiding surgeries and recovering from long-term chronic problems are increasing in number.

Research in this subset of peptides is promising, though not yet comprehensive or conclusive. Remember to consult your Doctor before taking any of these.

# What To Avoid

I think the best place to start is by showing you what to avoid.

Given the rapid rise in popularity, the claims are well outpacing the evidence-associated benefits.

Here’s a quick list of popular peptide compounds that do not (currently) meet the hype.

**BPC-157, TB-500, DSIP -** No human efficacy RCTs; only rodent or anecdotal data

**AOD-9604 -** Multiple phase-II trials failed primary weight-loss endpoints; minimal muscle data

**Follistatin-derived peptides -** Human work limited to gene-transfer pilots in muscular dystrophy [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5240576/); not available clinically

Medyo unusual lang for me kasi lahat ng nakausap ko before mga 2-3 months after nag aaya na yan sila to go out para mag coffee or mag lu lunch minsan may mga 1 week (di po ako tumutuloy pag ganito ). Siguro nasanay lang talaga ako before.

I was talking to the person face-to-face in the store mind you , smiling being nice and she just had a vary serious look on her face wasn’t being very friendly, but I was just assuming she was having a bad day so I didn’t take it personal at first. But when I asked her if I can do the (ask me) feature and put very light ice I noticed she chuckled and said yeah and I only ask that because I noticed that’s the only time I get the light ice amount that I like is when i use that feature (ask me) and then they usually tell me themselves I’ll put very light ice because there’s not a button that says that I’m like oh that’s perfect but she didn’t say that she just chuckled after I proceeded to pay. I even tipped her two dollars and said thank you went to go stand by the drinks to get my drinks that I ordered. I only ordered two drinks, my coffee, my sister-in-law‘s coffee, which was a simple caramel frappe Venti, and then two ice waters when I got my coffee like I said there was no light ice in my drink I feel that was the normal amount of ice even though it said light ice on the sticker it didn’t say very light ice like I assumed it would it just said light ice but even then I didn’t receive the light ice, but I didn’t tell them anything. I took the drink and just went on my day, but I definitely was bothered by that but would I be wrong to ask them to remake it.?

We both work Remotely and picked Atlanta due to the cost of living, proximity to family, airport, and the mild winters. 

We are looking to buy a home in the 700k range and would appreciate any recommendations for neighborhoods to explore. 

We want to be in a semi-walkable area, where we could walk to get coffee or grab a few things from the store, and be close-ish to downtown without a suburb feel. 

We've been looking at the neighborhoods east of downtown along I20 towards Decatur - are we on the right track? Places like Kirkwood, East Atlanta Village, etc.

He thought that was really strange and got me to explain I explained that if I go to a coffee shop on my own, I want to be completely anonymous there because otherwise it will feel like I have to do all the small talk with the owner (which I don’t think I can even deal on my own) and I would then be sort of acting the whole time I was in there and I couldn’t really relax cause I would feel like they were watching me and I’d know I’d have to do a proper goodbye when it was time to leave, rather than just walk out! I said I only wanted to go somewhere that i specifically DIDNT have a rapport with any one who worked there!

This visit was also because I had an odd episode of what felt like very low blood sugar at home about 3 days prior, suddenly dizzy/lightheaded (floaty, not room-spinning) cold sweat, shaking all over, after about 8 hrs awake, no ingestion of food, only coffee w/cream and sugar.
I am not diabetic, nor pre-diabetic. A1c and bgl normal.
The results were not relevant (maybe) to the episode, but it was discovered that I have macrocytic anemia - low rbc's, high MCV. B12 and folate were normal both times.  Additional tests were performed- haptoglobin -normal, and a peripheral blood smear. 
The PBS is whats odd.
The repeat CMP and CBCs show on the 11th and the 17th of this month, that I definitely have anemia. 
The PBR was supposed to be for the analysis of the macrocytic RBC's, right?
So here's what the pathologist wrote, word for word.

""Pathologist Review Peripheral Blood
Value
Red cell macrocytosis without an associated anemia. Macrocytosis can be seen in a wide variety of settings, including but not limited to: Chronic liver disease, severe hypothyroidism, as a drug related condition, and with certain vitamin/nutrient deficiencies. A primary bone marrow disorder is less likely given the lack of related cytopenia.""

Did the path fail to read the other test results? This is so weird, but I'm a ccp (critical care paramedic) so I am the first to admit I dont have enough training in lab results to know if I have missed something obvious.

My chronic anemia symptoms are fatigue, lightheadedness, pots, easy bruising, shortness of breath on reasonable exertion (gardening, farm type chores wear me out daily) and very constant heart palpitations, missed beats, 3tc diagnos3d as benign idiopathic arrhythmia (not particularly helpful, I know)

Im obvs worried about MDS, since I am not an alcoholic and haven't had cancer, nor any drugs that can trigger this.

Any ideas why pathology would deny the obvious anemia? Have I misunderstood something? Did path misunderstand something?

Please ask any questions, I'm an open book.

I also have Celiacs and Ehlers Danlos, hEDS, other types have been ruled out by genetic testing.",2,1750358412.0,AskDocs,7,1.0,False

Today I woke up, got him coffee like I do every a.m., and asked him “hey are we going to store your gun at your friends house while we’re on vacation?” He answered calmly and then I made a face when he said his friend would be gone. I don’t know what face I made. It was a combination of thinking and also dread bc I thought the friend was going to be traveling to where we are going. He got upset with me and said why are you making that face, I walked away because it’s the best course of action when he’s activated. He didn’t like that and opened the backdoor to yell he hated me. 

He then will say “you’ve been angry for weeks-“ when I don’t feel like I’ve been angry for weeks. I’ll ask him to share in a letter form how he feels, and then he never does but yells at me that I never listen to his feelings or I NEVER take accountability. He told me a year ago he was going to quit Kratom. He now is like “September I’m meeting with my doctor.

This is all over the place but I’m just tired. When he left a few weekends ago for a bachelor party I slept for two days straight. Like my nervous system finally got to relax.

Easy question.   Looking for advice.  

Regarding pain management.   My routine has been wake up, take pain meds and coffee.  I feel good so I spend approximately  2-3 hours walking around the house and taking on tasks that I can do without BLT.  I'll stop when I start to feel my back tighten up.  I'll grab my ice jell pack and sit in my recliner .  At this point I'm so in uncomfortable and counting three minutes until I hit that 5 hr mark to take my pain meds.  
  I feel better moving, but I find it difficult to stand in one place for any length of time.  I cannot sit in a dinning chair without pain and discomfort.   So, I'm either up moving about or in my recliner.  When evening comes round, I'm in so much pain. 
  Is this normal?  Am I doing too much before  taking a break?  I'm conflicted because I know moving is better than sitting around is much better for the healing process.  ",1,1750358131.0,spinalfusion,0,1.0,False

Psalm 13: Case File 001\*\* 

\*\*“Skinwalker Hollow”

 

\*\*FLAGSTAFF, ARIZONA\*\* 

\*\*Echo Ridge Trailhead — 14 Miles East of Town\*\* 

\*\*Altitude: 7,000 feet.\*\* 

Thick ponderosa pine forest. No cell service. Only whispers. 

 Five women have vanished here in six weeks. All were solo campers. There were no signs of struggle and no footprints leading away from the scene—only abandoned gear, soft impressions in the dirt, and fire pits still warm, as if the women had simply stood up mid-sentence and walked into the dark.

 What sets this case apart is that each woman left behind a voicemail message. 

 The messages were garbled and short, sent just seconds before they disappeared: 

“Someone’s out there.”  “It sounds like me… I don’t—” 

“It just said my name. My voice, but wrong.” 

 \*\*THE TEAM\*\* 

 

Lou Phillips and his squad—Medina, Martinez, Nolasco, Vega, and Gonzales—arrive under the guise of a hunting trip.. The media attributes the disappearances to bears.

 However, something feels off from the start. 

They move into the forest with silent precision, splitting into two-man teams near the last known GPS coordinates of the fifth camper, Kayla Morgan.

 \*\*Day One\*\*

 At dusk, Medina and Vega discover an undisturbed fire circle. Beneath some rocks, they find a buried journal that reads:

 “It knows what scares me. It wore my sister’s face last night. It smiled with teeth that weren’t hers. I can hear my voice crying for help. But I’m right here.”

 Martinez and Lou find boot prints—barefoot, human, but unusually long. The toes seem to drag, as if the person was resisting being walked.

 Then they hear it: soft and echoing between the trees.

 A woman’s voice whispers, “Help… I’m over here…”

 Lou raises a fist and everyone freezes.

 Medina states, “That’s Kayla.”

 Gonzales asks, “She’s alive?”

 Martinez firmly replies, “That’s not her, the cadence is off .”

 \*\*Nightfall\*\*

 They hear scratching on the tents. Each member of the squad is visited by something whispering in familiar voices: their mothers, sisters, wives, daughters. They cry, plead, and mocked.

 Nolasco pulls his weapon, but Lou grabs his hand. “That’s how it draws you out. Lets get them out in the open”

 \*\*Day Two\*\*

 They discover a structure built deep in the canyon—a ring of trees snapped inwards like a nest, with animal bones scattered around. In the center, they find a wooden door half-buried in the earth, its edges coated with handprints.

 They open it.

 Stale air and silence greet them as flashlights sweep across narrow tunnels. Then, they see movement.

 Eyes blink back from the dark.

 Kayla Morgan is there—barefoot, dehydrated, but alive. So are four other women, their eyes glazed as they whisper the Lord’s Prayer.

 They flinch from the light but do not run or scream.

 Medina reaches out gently. “It’s okay. You’re safe now.”

 Kayla’s voice cracks as she responds, “No. It’s still in me. Kill me kill me !!!

 

\*\*Extraction is Brutal\*\*

 The women scream when exposed to sunlight. Some try to claw their way back into the cave, while others sob, claiming that their bodies “don’t feel real anymore.”

 Back at the ranger station, no medical condition can explain their behavior. All the women are alive, with no physical trauma. However, something within them is broken.

 

\*\*Post-Mission Debrief, Flagstaff, Motel Room\*\*

 The squad sits in silence. No joking, no post-operation decompressing.

 Martinez lights a cigarette. “We didn’t get away. We survived.”

 

Lou stares out the window, looking toward the trees before responding. “Whatever that thing was… it didn’t kill them. It changed them, and I honestly don’t know what’s worse.”

 

Gonzales asks softly, “So what are we fighting?”

 

Lou replies, “This is still a Skinwalker, just more lore than we expected”

That night, as they prepare to return home, Lou quietly writes “” in his personal journal—a reminder.

 

This was just the beginning.

 

\*\*Psalm 13: Case File 001.2\*\* 

\*\*“Skinwalker Hollow” – Part II: The Key in the Pines\*\* 

 

\*\*Location:\*\* Private cabin outside Flagstaff. 

\*\*Time:\*\* 3:47 a.m. 

\*\*Weather:\*\* Clear. Moonless. Coyotes silent. 

 

The team is gathered around a worn kitchen table, each man awake despite the hour. No one has said much since they got the women out. 

 

They’re in the next room—alive, but not awake. Bodies limp. Mouths whispering fragments of thoughts that don’t sound like their own. 

 

Kayla Morgan stares at the ceiling, murmuring, 

“I’m still under the tree. Don’t leave my skin. It doesn’t fit right.” 

 

Medina rubs his temples. 

“This ain’t right, man. They’re here… but they’re not.” 

 

Vega interjects, 

“You saw them try to walk back into the woods. Like something was pulling them home.” 

 

Gonzales speaks quietly, 

“They’re possessed, bro.” 

 

Martinez is the last to speak, slow and firm. 

“No. They’re tethered.” 

 

He stands, moving to the wall where Lou had started drawing a rough map of the woods. He circles a canyon ridge, where they had found the women. 

 

Martinez continues, 

“This thing… the main one… it’s not just feeding. It’s nesting. Marking them—for prey it intends to come back for.” 

 

Lou steps forward, his voice low and controlled. 

“Then we cut the tether.”

 

\*\*Next Morning.\*\* 

 

The women are still whispering, but one of them—Maya Grant, the first woman who disappeared—begins to break the pattern. 

“You’ll find it beneath the thorns.” 

“Only fire breaks the mask.” 

“It still remembers the voice of the old blood.” 

 

The squad locks eyes. 

 

Medina mutters, 

“Is she talking riddles or is this—” 

 

Lou interrupts, 

“Clues.” 

 

They realize something chilling: the Skinwalker has a central form, unlike the shapeshifting fragments they encountered. It is a root. An alpha. 

 

And it still wears the form of someone it once was. 

 

Maya whispers one last thing before collapsing into silence: 

“He walks without skin, but wears your guilt.” 

 

\*\*Decision Made.\*\* 

 

 

This time, they won’t split up. They will go in as one. 

 

No flares. No tech chatter. Just steel, and fire. 

 

“We find the source,” Lou says, tightening his chest rig. 

“We kill it. And we set them free.” 

 

As they prepare their gear, Martinez passes a flask of whiskey. Nolasco sharpens an obsidian blade with Navajo origins. Gonzales mounts thermal scopes—eyes that see heat, not masks. 

 

Vega loads dragon’s breath shells. Just in case.   

 

\*\*Midnight Return.\*\* 

 

They reach the place the women were found. Lou spots something they missed before: 

 

A wide gash in the earth, where the trees grow in a perfect circle, bark blackened, and the air humming like a distant scream. 

 

Beneath the roots, they find bones—hundreds, some human, some animal—all arranged like a crude altar. 

 

And in the center— 

 

A figure. 

 

Tall. Skinless. Limbs too long. Face a perfect imitation of Lou’s brother, Jeff. 

 

But it isn’t Jeff. 

 

It smiles with rotting teeth and says, 

“Brother.” 

 

Lou doesn’t blink. His tunnel vision kicks in. His blood goes cold. His vision narrows. 

 

CRACK-CRACK-CRACK.

 

Lou fired three rounds center mass.

 

Too fast.

 

The Skinwalker twisted unnaturally and darted through the trees like liquid muscle. Bark exploded from the trunks it grazed. It vanished into the black.

 

Lou didn’t hesitate.

Dropped his rifle. Drew his sidearm. Moved fast.

 

Another blur—too late.

 

It crashed into Lou like a falling tree, claws slashing. Lou went down hard.

 

It pinned him, leaned close, and whispered in Jeff’s voice:

 

\> “You should have , little brother.”

 

 

The rage ignited.

 

Lou didn’t scream. He only hyperventilated

 

He headbutted the monster so hard it staggered back.

 

Rolled with the momentum—came up swinging.

 

A straight right to the jaw, a left hook that cracked bone. A body shot that echoed like wood splitting.

 

The Skinwalker reeled.

 

It had never—never—been hit like this.

 

Not by prey.

 

Lou closed in, stalking, brutal.

 

Olympic wrestling footwork. Elbows like hammers. Knees like steel.

 

Five strikes. Six. Seven.

Blood—not human—splashed against tree bark.

 

The Skinwalker shrieked in a voice that wasn’t Jeff’s anymore.

 

It scrambled back, claws raised. But Lou didn’t let up.

 

He grabbed its arm, snapped it at the joint, then drove his knee into its chest—right where its heart pulsed, hanging outside the ribs like a tumor.

 

Lou grabbed his combat knife.

The handle was wrapped in tape.

Fuck you was carved into the steel.

 

He plunged the blade deep in the skinwalkers throat

.

 

The Skinwalker screamed—not from its throat, but from everywhere.

 

The earth around them trembled. A wave of shrieks echoed through the forest. The tether was breaking.

 

And then…

 

Silence.

 

The Skinwalker collapsed. The illusion of Jeff’s face peeled away like wet paper. Just bone underneath.

 

It was dead.

 

Really dead.

 

 

\---

 

Back at the cabin.

 

The women—Kayla, Maya, the others—woke up.

 

No more whispers. No more sleepwalking.

 

Maya looked at Lou as tears spilled down her cheeks.

 

\> “You... you brought me back.”

 

 

 

Lou didn’t say anything.

 

He just stepped outside, breathing hard, fists still clenched.

 

Martinez followed, setting a hand on his shoulder.

 

“You good, brother?”

 

Lou’s eyes were fixed on the treeline.

 

“No,” he said.

 

 

Martinez nodded.

 

\*\*Psalm 13 – Campfire Debrief\*\* 

\*Location: Backwoods cabin outside Flagstaff\* 

\*Time: 3:11 a.m.\*

 

The fire crackled. No one had spoken in ten minutes.

 

Not because they had nothing to say.

 

But because they didn't know how to say it.

 

Lou was inside, washing off dark blood in silence. Outside, the rest of them sat in a rough circle, surrounded by empty beer cans and scarred faces—ghosts haunted by something worse than death:

 

A new reality.

 

Gonzales was the first to break the silence.

 

“Bro, did anyone else see that? Like—actually see it?”

 

Vega nodded slowly, his eyes wide.

 

“He beat it to death. With his hands. That thing was like a fucking demon, and Lou turned it into mulch.”

 

Medina gave a half-laugh, half-wince, still wrapping a cut on his forearm.

 

“Dude, I threw a flashbang at it and ran. Lou? Lou charged at it. Who the hell does that?”

 

Nolasco just stared into the fire.

 

“That wasn’t adrenaline. That was something else. It was… primal. Cold. I’ve seen UFC fighters break jaws, but he went for the heart, man.”

 

Silence hung in the air for a moment. Then Martinez leaned forward, his voice low.

 

“You boys remember Lous first day at the unit? Remember how he was back then?”

 

They all did.

 

Quiet. Watchful. First one up and the last one to eat. He took punches in training without flinching. He didn’t smile much, but when he did, you remembered it.

 

Martinez exhaled slowly, like smoke leaving his chest.

 

“I trained that kid. I saw what he had early on. But what he did back there? That wasn’t just skill. That was pain. Controlled. Directed. Weaponized.”

 

Medina shook his head in disbelief.

 

“If that thing had a soul, Lou beat it out of its body.”

 

Gonzales looked around, dead serious.

 

“So… does this make Lou the boogeyman now?”

 

Vega smirked.

“Nah. Calling Lou the boogeyman would be disrespectful.”

 

That finally broke the tension, and a ripple of chuckles passed through the group—a nervous relief.

 

But beneath it all lay respect, fear, and the beginning of something bigger.

 

Martinez stood up and looked toward the cabin.

 

“He’s not normal. He’s never been. But whatever’s coming next? We follow him.”

 

One by one, they all nodded.

 

Because Lou wasn’t just the muscle.

 

He was the compass now.

 

 

Psalm 13 – Chapter: Ghost Returns

Location: Northern Arizona – Desert Safehouse

Time: 10:04 a.m. – Two Weeks After the Flagstaff Incident

 

The safehouse hummed with quiet purpose.

 

Wires fed into the walls, solar panels buzzed softly on the roof, and Medina had finally patched the uplink to encrypted channels. The team was building the skeleton of something bigger—a mission, a watchtower, a sanctuary for the damned who still fought back.

 

But upstairs, in the quiet of an empty room with no personal effects, Lou Phillips stared at the mirror.

 

The face looking back wasn’t the boy his parents buried.

That boy had soft eyes. A crooked smile. Hope.

 

Now?

 

Now he looked like the thing Jeff left behind.

 

 

 

Outside the Safehouse

 

Martinez leaned against the front porch rail, arms crossed, watching as Lou stepped into the Arizona daylight. Lou wore a plain hoodie and jeans—no body armor, no rifle. Just his .45 and the photograph of his parents tucked in a breast pocket.

 

“You sure about this?” Martinez asked, voice low.

 

 

 

Lou nodded once.

 

“I was supposed to be in that coffin. They buried a casket full of ash and lies. I owe them more than that. Do you remember what you said  my subconscious, do you know what popped in my head first.

 

Martinez answered. “Jeff ? “

 

Lou replied.

 

“No my parents before they died, its been so long since I thought about them as they. All I’ve ever remembered was blood.” 

 

Martinez didn’t try to stop him.

 

He just handed him a folded cloth—a small, embroidered square. It was a stitched Psalm verse, frayed at the edges. Something from basic training. Something Martinez kept, for all these years.

 

“Give it to them. Tell ’em their boy became something.”

 

Lou tucked it into his jacket.

 

Two days Later – Brookpine Cemetery, New Jersey

Overcast. Cold. Quiet.

 

The cemetery gates creaked open on hinges that hadn’t been oiled in a decade. Lou moved through it like a shadow. Hoodie drawn up. Head low. Not a soul recognized him—not the groundskeeper, not the old woman laying roses by a soldier’s headstone.

 

He found the plot on instinct. It had haunted his dreams for years.

Two headstones side by side.

 

Margaret Woods

Beloved Wife. Mother. Never Forgotten.

 

Peter Woods

Marine. Protector. Devoted Father.

 

And next to them, a third:

 

Louis Woods

1999 – 2013

Gone too soon. But never alone.

 

Lou stood there for a long time. His throat tightened.

He knelt.

 

“I’m sorry,” he whispered.

 

The wind picked up. Leaves scattered like ashes. “He came for me. He took everything. But I’m still here. I shouldn’t be… but I am.”

 

He set the stitched cloth from Martinez between the stones, pressing it into the dirt.

 

“I’m not that scared kid anymore. I became someone. Someone who hunts monsters.”

 

His hand trembled. For a moment, just a moment—he felt like that boy again.

 

“I’ll make him pay. Not just for me. For you. For all of you

Brookpine Cemetery – Late Afternoon

 

The air had grown colder. Clouds pressed low against the earth like they were grieving too.

 

Lou stood still between the headstones, the stitched cloth now half-buried in soil. Wind stirred the trees. A crow called somewhere in the distance.

 

Then—footsteps.

 

Soft, deliberate.

 

Coming from behind him.

 

Lou didn’t move. He didn’t reach for the .45 at his back.

He just waited.

 

Whoever it was didn’t feel like a threat.

Not to him.

 

“You knew him?” a voice asked behind him. Female. Low. Hollow in that way only grief could make it.

 

 

 

He turned his head slightly.

 

The woman stood in dark clothes. A hood. Pale skin. Jet-black hair that curled slightly around her face. Her eyes were distant, sunken with memory. The tone of her voice suggested she'd been carrying pain for a long, long time.

 

“Knew who?” Lou asked.

 

She looked at the grave. At the name: Louis Woods.

 

“The boy. Lou. I… I used to know him. Long time ago.”

 

 

 

Lou turned now. Fully. Faced her.

 

And then he said it. “Yeah… I knew him.”

 

 

 

The woman’s brow furrowed. She tilted her head.

 

Then her eyes scanned his face.

 

And froze.

 

“…No.”

 

Lou said nothing.

 

She stepped forward slowly, almost afraid to get closer—like seeing him too clearly might shatter something inside her. Her hands trembled. Her lips parted. But no words came out.

 

“You’re dead,” she whispered. “I went to your funeral. I—Lou, I saw your face in my nightmares. Jeff…”

 

Lou nodded once. “I know.”

And just like that, she stopped breathing. Or maybe she remembered she hadn’t been breathing in years.

 

“Lou…” Her voice cracked.

 

He just looked at her—calm, steady.

 

Not afraid. Not confused. Not surprised.

 

“Jane.”

 

It hit her like a bullet to the chest.

 

Her knees almost buckled, but she caught herself. She hadn’t cried in years. Couldn’t. But something inside her shifted. For the first time since her death… she felt something. Something warm. Alive.

 

“You’re alive.”

 

 

 

Lou gave a faint smile—almost nothing. But it meant everything.

 

“You too,” he said.

 

 

 

Her expression darkened just slightly.

 

“Not really.”

 

 

 

He tilted his head slightly. Looking closer now.

 

Lou’s eyes were trained to spot threats. Trauma. Movement. Energy.

And now… he saw it.

 

Something behind her. Not human. A presence.

 

It coiled around her like a shadow with too much weight.

Not evil. But not merciful either.

 

It watched Lou with something close to… confusion.

 

It had carried Jane across the veil, kept her going—fueled her hate, her mission.

But Lou?

 

Lou didn’t register like other men.

 

He wasn’t cursed.

He wasn’t blessed.

He was… something else.

 

It whispered—but not in a language he knew. He ignored it.

 

His eyes never left Jane.

 

“Does it hurt?” Lou asked quietly.

 

 

 

She looked down.

 

“No. That’s the problem. Nothing does.”

 

 

 

He took a breath. Not pity. Not judgment.

 

“You still you?”

 

 

 

She nodded. Slowly.

 

“Most days. The rest… I fake.”

 

 

 

Lou nodded once, accepting it without hesitation.

 

“Good. Then we’re both ghosts.”

 

 

 

She looked up at him again. And for a flicker of a second—she smiled.

Brookpine Cemetery – Dusk

 

They stood in silence for a while.

The wind had softened. The world around them had gone still, like the dead themselves were listening.

 

Jane stared at the grave, lips parted, a faint tremble in her jaw. The woman known to the world as Jane the Killer—a name whispered like a curse—looked… small.

 

Not weak.

Just human again.

 

“Why are you here, Lou?”

 

 

 

Lou looked up at the sky.

 

“I owed them a goodbye.”

 

 

 

“You were gone a long time.”

 

 

 

“Had to be. The world thought I was dead.”

(He glanced sideways at her)

“You too.”

 

 

 

She nodded. Quiet. Her hair moved slightly with the breeze, but her feet stayed planted like she wasn’t sure she was allowed to leave.

 

“You killed a lot of people,” Lou said bluntly.

 

 

 

She winced.

 

But he didn’t flinch. Didn’t accuse. Didn’t raise his voice.

 

Just said it like a fact.

 

“They deserved it,” she replied, coldly. “Every one of them. Rapists. Predators. Monsters in suits. I made sure.”

 

 

 

“Still killed ‘em,” Lou said, eyes narrowing.

“And it cost you.”

 

 

 

That silence again. Heavy.

 

“Do you still feel anything?” he asked.

 

 

 

“Only when I saw you.”

 

Lou replied

“ Sounds like hope.”

 

He nodded, as if that made sense.

 

“Then come with me.”

 

 

 

She blinked.

 

“What?”

 

 

 

“Come with me. Back to Arizona. I got a place. People who trust me. We’re building something. You don’t have to kill anymore. Just be there.”

 

 

 

She looked at him like he was speaking a foreign language.

 

“You… trust me?”

 

 

 

“I know what Jeff did to you,” he said simply. “I know what it made you into. But I don’t see a killer. I see somebody trying to crawl back toward the light. Even if your hands are covered in blood.”

 

 

 

Jane looked away. The entity around her seemed to twist, reacting. But Lou never looked at it.

 

Only her.

 

“No one’s looked at me like that since before it all went to hell.”

 

“Then maybe it’s time someone did.”

 

 

 

 

 

The Drive – Arizona Bound

Three hours later.

 

The desert stretched out on either side.

 

Lou’s truck rolled through the dark,

Jane sat in the passenger seat. Hair tied back now. Hood off. She kept stealing glances at him.

 

“You drive like a cop,” she muttered.

 

 

 

Lou smirked faintly.

 

“Seriously?”

 

 

She nodded slowly, watching him.

 

“So what have you been doing? These past years?”

 

 

 

Lou exhaled.

 

“Army. Green Beret. Got out. But I couldn’t stay still. Found others like me. Started hunting the real threats. Not people. Things.”

 

 

 

Her brows knit together.

 

“Like what?”

 

“Cryptids. Cursed entities. Things that don’t belong in this world. Stuff we thought were stories.”

 

“And you just… decided to fight them?”

 

“Someone had to.”

 

 

 

She looked out the window for a moment. Then back at him.

 

“Far cry from the quiet boy that followed his older brother around.”

 

Lou replied

 I’m trying. Same as you.”

 

 

 

Another beat of silence.

 

“Why are you helping me, Lou?”

 

“Because I remember who you were before Jeff took everything from you . And I think that girl’s still in there.”

 

Jane looked down at her hands. For once, they didn’t look like weapons.

 

“I don’t want to hurt anyone anymore.”

 

“Then don’t.”

 

Lou pulled off the highway. The outline of the safehouse glowed faintly in the distance—warm, waiting.

 

“Home?” she asked.

 

 

 

“Yeah. For now. I have a Cabin close by”

 

She leaned her head against the window.

 

“Sounds nice.”

 

 

Psalm 13 Safehouse – Arizona

 

The air smelled like sweat, cedar, and gun oil. A punching bag swung lazily from a new support beam as Vega and Gonzales tried to hook up a flat screen. Martinez was barking orders, shirt off, sawdust clinging to his chest hair like war paint.

 

“Medina! That door frame is crooked again, I swear I’ll duct tape your skull to the goddamn level!”

 

The sound of tires crunching gravel cut through the heat.

 

The truck stopped. Doors opened. First came Lou—stone-faced

 

Then came her.

 

Jane stepped out, eyes shielded by her hood. Black hoodie. Pale hands.

 

The squad went quiet like wolves sniffing something unnatural.

 

“Uh…” Gonzales squinted. “Lou? You bring a fan?”

 

Jane didn’t blink.

 

“Only if she’s here to kill us,” Vega muttered, half-joking, half-not.

 

“Dibs on haunting the TV,” Medina added.

 

Martinez turned slowly from the wall he was hammering.

“Who is she?”

Lou didn’t break stride.

 

“This is Jane Arkensaw.”

 

“The Jane?” Gonzales asked. “Jane the Killer?”

 

Jane cocked her head slightly. “That’s what they call me.”

 

Gonzales looked her up and down, paused, then said:

 

“Huh. Thought you’d be taller.”

 

The squad laughed.

 

Jane blinked again. Confused.

 

“That’s an odd reaction?”

 

Martinez finally stepped forward. Not smiling. Not hostile.

 

“Look,” he said. “We’ve seen demons. The real kind. Heard things cry in languages older than sin. If Lou brought you here, that’s all we need to know.”

 

He pointed at her chest—not to intimidate, but to ground her.

 

“You don’t answer to the world anymore. Not here.”

 

 

She stared at him. At the weight of his words. For the first time in years, she felt something unfamiliar: safe.

 

“Also,” Martinez added, “if you’re gonna live here, we’re doing movie night every Friday. First pick’s yours unless you choose Twilight—in which case, back to the woods you go.”

 

Gonzales cackled. “Let her stay, bro. She looks like she could beat Vega’s ass.”

 

“She probably could,” Vega admitted.

 

The team eased around her like she’d always been there.

 

And just like that, Jane wasn’t a monster.

 

She was one of the boys.

 

 

 

Later That Night – Rooftop

 

Jane sat on the roof alone, legs pulled in close. The desert stretched out like a burned canvas, the moon pale and bruised.

 

Inside her, the entity stirred.

 

Its voice came like the echo of a memory behind glass.

 

(He is not what he seems.)

 

“Lou?”

 

 

 

(There is… familiarity. I felt it when you stood beside him. Like something I once knew. Long ago.)

 

“You don’t remember anything from before me.”

 

 

 

(I didn’t. But now—there’s a… warmth. Like the edge of a fire I’ve forgotten how to build.)

 

“What does that mean?”

 

 

 

(It means I am older than you know. And he is not just man.)

 

Jane looked toward the backyard, where Lou was sitting alone with a whiskey bottle and an old Bible on the table.

 

The squad had let her be. No lectures. No fear. Just dumb jokes and muscle and trust.

 

“He called me human.”

 

 

 

(That’s why it hurts.)

 

“What?”

 

 

 

(Because for the first time in years… you almost believe him.)

 

Jane exhaled slowly, resting her forehead against her knees.

 

“I don’t know what he is,” she whispered.

 

 

 

(Neither do I.)

 

 

Morning – Psalm 13 Safehouse Yard

 

The sun was barely up, turning the sky a soft burnt orange. The Arizona desert buzzed low with life. Wind swept through mesquite trees and the scent of coffee and gun oil drifted in the air.

 

Jane stood on the back porch of the safehouse, hood still up, watching.

 

She didn’t speak. Didn’t move.

 

She just watched.

 

Out in the yard, chaos lived in harmony.

 

Vega and Gonzales were dragging sandbags into a combat pit they’d been building out of tires and plywood. Martinez stood nearby, barking half-serious criticisms while casually fixing a jammed M4. Nolasco hit the heavy bag with clean, practiced elbows. But the real star…

 

Was Medina.

 

Shirtless. Again.

 

He was trying to vault over a stack of ammo crates and do some sort of reverse roll he saw in a movie.

 

“Medina,” Martinez snapped, not even looking up, “if you pull your back doing Power Ranger shit again, I swear to God I’m gonna leak your Icloud photos

 

 

 

“Let him work, bro!” Gonzales laughed. “His shirt’s already off, he’s in character.”

 

 

 

“Man hasn’t worn a shirt since we raided that haunted Waffle House,” Vega added. “It’s part of his religion now.”

 

 

 

Jane blinked, arms folded, half-expecting this to descend into violence. But it didn’t. It was loud. Dumb. And strangely warm.

 

Lou stepped out beside her, sipping coffee from a chipped wooden mug.

 

“Every mission,” he said without looking at her, “his shirt ends up off.”

 

 

 

Jane glanced sideways at him.

 

“Every mission?”

 

 

 

“Even coffee runs.”

 

 

 

“Why?”

 

 

 

“No one knows. We stopped asking. We just… accept it.”

 

“Is he…?”

 

“I don’t think so, He had a girlfriend.”

 

Jane huffed. Almost a laugh.

 

“You’re serious.”

 

“Dead.”

 

 

 

They stood there in silence, watching Medina trip on a rake and pretend he didn’t.

 

Then Lou turned slightly, nodding toward the yard.

 

“This is the training ground. We run drills here. Test gear. Beat the hell out of each other when words don’t work.”

 

 

 

Jane’s expression hardened.

 

“You let them beat each other up?”

 

 

 

“Better us than what’s out there.”

 

 

 

She watched a moment longer. Nolasco offered Vega a glove tap. Vega nodded, dropped into a boxing stance. The hits were hard but controlled. Clean. Respectful.

 

“They listen to you,” Jane said.

 

 

 

“Sometimes.”

 

 

 

“And this place—”

 

 

 

“It’s the only thing keeping us sane.”

 

 

 

Jane slowly descended the porch steps. The dirt crunched under her boots.

 

“They don’t treat me like I’m broken,” she murmured.

 

 

 

Lou looked her dead in the eyes.

 

“Because you’re not, Jeff’s broken.”

 

 

 

She flinched—not from pain, but something worse. Hope.

 

She turned away quickly, arms crossed again.

 

“I don’t know what I am anymore.”

 

 

 

Lou shrugged.

 

“Start with what you want to be.”

 

 

 

She looked back to the yard, where Medina now attempted a flying knee at a punching bag that was not ready for it.

 

The others cheered.

 

Jane let out a small breath.

 

Something in her chest stirred. The weight didn’t vanish, but it shifted.

 

For the first time in years…

 

She wanted to protect something.

 

Safehouse Yard – Midmorning

 

The sun was climbing higher now, casting sharp shadows across the sand. Medina had finally put a shirt back on—though it looked temporary—and the rest of the squad had dispersed for various tasks. The yard buzzed with easy rhythm. Jane sat on an old crate near the perimeter wall, sharpening a blade more out of habit than need.

 

Martinez walked up slow, boots crunching gravel.

 

“That’s a custom blade?” he asked, squinting as he lit a cigarette.

 

 

 

Jane didn’t look up.

 

“Made it myself.”

 

 

 

“Looks like it could shave bark off a redwood.”

 

 

 

She smirked. A little.

 

“Only if I like the tree.”

 

 

 

Martinez exhaled smoke through his nose, crouching nearby, elbows resting on his knees. Silence hung comfortably before he finally broke it.

 

“You knew him before all this.”

 

 

 

Jane’s hands paused on the blade.

 

“Yeah.”

 

 

 

Martinez looked out over the yard—toward the makeshift weight bench Lou had built from a steel axle and two truck tires.

 

“Never said much about the past. But I know pain when I see it.”

 

 

 

Jane set the blade down, her voice quieter now.

 

“Lou wasn’t just some good kid. He was… decent in a way most people grow out of. He looked people in the eye. He believed in things.”

 

 

 

“Still does,” Martinez muttered. “Even if it burns him.”

 

 

 

She nodded.

 

“After what Jeff did… he should’ve died. You know that, right? He was declared dead. Official. Body bag and everything.”

 

 

 

Martinez turned to look at her now.

 

“You were there?”

 

“I was there before. At the house. Before Jeff went full monster.

 

 

 

He thought Jeff was just angry. Lashing out. But Jeff…”

 

 

 

Her voice faltered. Her eyes dropped to the ground.

 

“Jeff wasn’t human anymore.”

 

 

 

She swallowed hard.

 

Later, I found out—Lou crawled. Five miles. Throat cut. Face slashed. Barely breathing. Just dragging himself through the dirt.” Then he came for me and my family.

Jane stopped there

 

 

 

 

Martinez stiffened. He hadn’t known that part.

 

“Jesus…”

 

 

 

“No one should’ve survived that. But he did. They found him just before dawn. Hands were ground raw. Body shredded. They said it looked like he'd been hunted by a pack of animals. But he kept going.”

 

 

 

Martinez took a long drag from his cigarette.

 

“That’s why he’s the way he is.”

 

 

 

“He doesn’t hate Jeff,” Jane said, looking at Martinez for the first time. “Not the way I do. Lou… hates what Jeff took from him. What he almost turned into.”

 

 

 

Martinez looked down at his boots.

 

“We saw pieces of it. The tunnel vision. That look he gets in combat. Like he’s not seeing them. He’s seeing Jeff.”

 

 

 

Jane nodded slowly.

 

“Yeah. But even then, he still pulls back. Still refuses to become the thing that hurt him.”

 

 

 

“He ever talk to you about God?”

 

 

 

Jane nodded again.

 

“A few times. He said if he ever let go of that thread, he’d never come back.”

 

 

 

Martinez dropped the cigarette and crushed it beneath his heel.

 

“That thread’s the only reason we follow him. Because he never cut it—even when it would’ve been easier.”

 

 

 

A silence stretched between them again, deeper this time.

 

Finally, Martinez stood up, brushing dust from his knees.

 

“I’m glad you’re here. Just so you know.”

 

Jane Replied

 

“I wasn’t sure I would be welcome.”

 

 

 

“You’re family now. Nobody here’s perfect. We all got blood on our hands. Some of us got more than others… but we’re still standing.”

 

 

 

“Thanks, Martinez.”

 

 

 

“Don’t thank me. Just make sure Medina doesn’t set the damn range on fire again. We’ve only got one.”

 

 

Jane hands Martinez the knife .

 

Martinez asks . Are you sure ?

 

Jane says. If he says I don’t need to fight, I wont

 

Martinez smirks. Just so you know Im giving when he graduates from the rape whistle.

 

Jane replied. So its gonna be a while

 

He turned to walk away, then paused.

 

“You’re the only one he really talks to, you know.”

 

“Lou?”

 

“Yeah. You bring him back. Little by little.”

 

Jane watched him go.

 

Then looked back at the training yard—at the life these men had built in the ashes of monsters.

 

The sun was dipping below the desert ridgeline, casting the landscape in bruised shades of purple and orange. The heat had finally let up. Wind stirred the dust low along the ground. Lou stood near the back of the safehouse, tightening a bolt on a rain barrel setup when he heard soft footsteps approaching.

 

Jane.

 

No words yet. Just the sound of her shoes crunching against gravel. She came to stand beside him, arms crossed but relaxed. She looked out across the property—training yard to the left, the mess area with its crooked picnic table to the right, and beyond that, open sand and cactus stretching into nothingness.

 

“I’ve never been to Arizona,” she said finally.

 

Lou gave a faint nod, still looking straight ahead. “It’s peaceful, if you don’t mind the heat. Rattlesnakes don’t give you much trouble if you show ‘em respect.”

 

“That a metaphor?” she asked, smirking slightly.

 

Lou cracked a smile. Just barely.

 

“No. Just snakes.”

 

They started walking. Slow. No rush. Just silence and boots on the earth.

 

Jane looked around as they moved past the perimeter wire.

 

“Did you build this fence?”

 

“Mostly Martinez. But I tightened the lines.”

 

“It’s neat. Like a fortress.”

 

“We like to sleep knowing there’s at least some warning before something claws through.”

 

They passed the pull-up rig, where Medina had been showing off earlier. The bar was still swaying slightly from his last set.

 

“Your team’s something else,” Jane said.

 

Lou looked toward the horizon, then back at her. “They’re brothers. All earned.”

 

“They don’t look at me like I’m broken.”

 

“You’re not.”

 

Jane turned to face him. Her voice lowered. “You don’t flinch. Not at my scars. Not at my story.”

 

Lou met her gaze. Steady.

 

“I’ve had to carry my own.”

 

She swallowed, eyes briefly shimmering with something distant. “You were a kid. When Jeff did what he did. You shouldn’t have survived.”

 

Lou’s jaw flexed.

 

“I didn’t. Not the version they buried.” He paused. “The one who came back… he had to make peace with the ghosts. Or at least learn to walk beside ‘em.”

 

They stopped at a shed with a rusted door. Lou pulled it open. Inside sat a half-covered old black ’70 Chevelle SS, frame stripped, hood popped, tools laid out in a methodical circle.

 

Jane’s eyes widened slightly. “This yours?”

 

“Used to belong to my dad,” Lou said quietly. I never knew it existed until it was gifted to me by a family friend.

 

She stepped closer, brushing dust off the hood with her fingers.

 

“You ever gonna finish it?”

 

Lou looked at the car like it was a memory that could still breathe.

 

“Yeah. Just been waiting for the right time.”

 

“And now?”

 

Lou didn’t answer right away. Instead, he crouched beside the car, brushing his fingers over the exposed engine block.

 

“I think I’m ready to stop surviving and start… building.”

 

Jane leaned on the frame, watching him work.

 

“You think someone like me can do that?” she asked, voice almost a whisper.

 

Lou stood. Faced her. Voice calm, certain.

 

“I don’t think you’re someone like anything. You’re you. You made it back. That’s enough to start.”

 

She blinked hard and looked down at the Chevelle.

 

“It’s not perfect,” she said, nodding at the car.

 

“Neither am I.”

 

The wind picked up, carrying the scent of mesquite and engine grease. For a moment, neither of them spoke.

 

Then Lou turned to her again.

 

“You ever want to learn how to fix an engine?”

 

Jane raised an eyebrow. “You offering to teach me?”

 

“Only if you don’t mind swearing a lot when things don’t go right.”

 

She chuckled.

 

“Sounds like therapy.”

 

Lou nodded once.

 

“Sometimes it is.”

 

And there, in the shed surrounded by dust and the quiet hum of possibility, something real and slow began to take root—no longer haunted, but healing.",1,1750357965.0,Creepypastastories,0,1.0,False

- first 3 shots (grind at 15, 17 and 19): no coffee at all
- fourth shot (grind 21): very very slow
- fifth shit (grind 22): some decent coffee

Is it normal for a freshly roasted Arabica blend to need such a coarse grind size?

1lfiakz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1lfiakz/i_finally_confronted_my_friend_about_her_husbands/,I finally confronted my friend about her husband’s creepy drunk behavior — and I’m glad I did,"So… I (30s, F) have this friend I’ll call Lina, who I met through work a few years ago when she had just moved from Mexico to Europe to be with her long-term boyfriend, Carlos. We became close, along with two other coworkers — let’s call them Sarah and Polly. Over time, we got to know Carlos too. He’s charming and funny… but the moment he drinks, he becomes that guy. Clingy, touchy, inappropriate. A “bad drunk” through and through.

Years ago, at Lina’s house, Carlos kissed my forehead with way too much tongue for it to be anything but gross. I told Lina immediately, and her response was something like “ugh, he’s drunk, sorry about that.” She kind of brushed it off.

Later, Sarah told me that Carlos had gotten handsy with her one night and made inappropriate comments about his sex life with Lina. That really crossed a line. Polly, meanwhile, had started to drift away from the group — and although she never said why, it wasn’t hard to guess.

Over time, Carlos kept doing weird things when drunk — like telling my partner (who had just met him!) that he only had sex once a month and asking him for cocaine. On another occasion, he got drunk at a game night we hosted and was touching my partner way too much under the excuse of “just trying to be closer friends.” He also passed out halfway through the night — and we later found out he had peed on our bathroom floor. No apology. No mention of it. We didn’t confront them directly, but I made enough passive comments that Lina definitely picked up on my discomfort. Afterwards, we got many apology messages from him out of the blue, so we eventually tried letting it go.

The last straw was a few weeks ago. We went out for Lina’s birthday. Carlos was already drunk before we even got to the club. In the car, I was sitting in the back seat between Carlos and Polly. We were both wearing skirts. At one point, Carlos started trying to grope our legs — and not subtly. He was clearly trying to pull up our skirts while pretending to be funny or sleepy. We were both tipsy and honestly just in shock, so we kept brushing his hands away and redirecting him like you would with a toddler. Lina was in the front seat and didn’t see any of it. Obviously this was NOT ok.

At the club, he kept trying to hover around Polly, and I found myself constantly stepping in or redirecting things. Lina was off dancing and not really aware of what was happening.

The next day, I decided enough was enough. I scheduled to meet up with Lina for coffee and told her what had happened. I also told her about other times I’d felt uncomfortable — and how my partner had too. I made it very clear that while I’m not judging her relationship, I do have to protect my own boundaries, and that I can’t keep pretending things are fine around Carlos if this is how he acts when he drinks.

To her credit, Lina took it better than I expected. She said she did know Carlos gets “affectionate” when drunk but insisted it was never with bad intentions. I told her that intention doesn’t really matter when the impact is making people uncomfortable and disrespected. She agreed that it was inappropriate and disrespectful, not just to her friends, but to her as well. She said the real issue is his drinking — that he spirals emotionally and loses control, and that it’s something they’ve already argued about before.

She told me she wants him to apologize to me and my partner, but that she didn’t want to confront him immediately because he’s been depressed for months over work and money problems, and they also recently lost their dog. She said he’s emotionally very fragile right now, and she doesn’t think he’s in a place where he can fully process how serious this is.

Honestly, I didn’t even expect an apology, and I’m not hanging my hopes on one. What matters most to me is that I spoke up and finally said what I needed to say. Polly and Sarah were both relieved when I told them. Polly admitted she’d felt uncomfortable in the group for a long time because of him, and Sarah said it was better this way — that Lina can handle her relationship however she wants, but now the truth is out there, and I don’t have to carry it alone.

Moving forward, I’ll probably still hang out with Lina, but I’ll be more selective about group settings that involve Carlos. I just don’t want to be around him when alcohol is involved.

It’s not easy having these conversations, but I’m really glad I did. It’s helped me reclaim a sense of safety in my friendships and feel like I can be honest about what I need to feel respected.

Psalm 13: Case File 001\*\* 

\*\*“Skinwalker Hollow”

 

\*\*FLAGSTAFF, ARIZONA\*\* 

\*\*Echo Ridge Trailhead — 14 Miles East of Town\*\* 

\*\*Altitude: 7,000 feet.\*\* 

Thick ponderosa pine forest. No cell service. Only whispers. 

 Five women have vanished here in six weeks. All were solo campers. There were no signs of struggle and no footprints leading away from the scene—only abandoned gear, soft impressions in the dirt, and fire pits still warm, as if the women had simply stood up mid-sentence and walked into the dark.

 What sets this case apart is that each woman left behind a voicemail message. 

 The messages were garbled and short, sent just seconds before they disappeared: 

“Someone’s out there.”  “It sounds like me… I don’t—” 

“It just said my name. My voice, but wrong.” 

 \*\*THE TEAM\*\* 

 

Lou Phillips and his squad—Medina, Martinez, Nolasco, Vega, and Gonzales—arrive under the guise of a hunting trip.. The media attributes the disappearances to bears.

 However, something feels off from the start. 

They move into the forest with silent precision, splitting into two-man teams near the last known GPS coordinates of the fifth camper, Kayla Morgan.

 \*\*Day One\*\*

 At dusk, Medina and Vega discover an undisturbed fire circle. Beneath some rocks, they find a buried journal that reads:

 “It knows what scares me. It wore my sister’s face last night. It smiled with teeth that weren’t hers. I can hear my voice crying for help. But I’m right here.”

 Martinez and Lou find boot prints—barefoot, human, but unusually long. The toes seem to drag, as if the person was resisting being walked.

 Then they hear it: soft and echoing between the trees.

 A woman’s voice whispers, “Help… I’m over here…”

 Lou raises a fist and everyone freezes.

 Medina states, “That’s Kayla.”

 Gonzales asks, “She’s alive?”

 Martinez firmly replies, “That’s not her, the cadence is off .”

 \*\*Nightfall\*\*

 They hear scratching on the tents. Each member of the squad is visited by something whispering in familiar voices: their mothers, sisters, wives, daughters. They cry, plead, and mocked.

 Nolasco pulls his weapon, but Lou grabs his hand. “That’s how it draws you out. Lets get them out in the open”

 \*\*Day Two\*\*

 They discover a structure built deep in the canyon—a ring of trees snapped inwards like a nest, with animal bones scattered around. In the center, they find a wooden door half-buried in the earth, its edges coated with handprints.

 They open it.

 Stale air and silence greet them as flashlights sweep across narrow tunnels. Then, they see movement.

 Eyes blink back from the dark.

 Kayla Morgan is there—barefoot, dehydrated, but alive. So are four other women, their eyes glazed as they whisper the Lord’s Prayer.

 They flinch from the light but do not run or scream.

 Medina reaches out gently. “It’s okay. You’re safe now.”

 Kayla’s voice cracks as she responds, “No. It’s still in me. Kill me kill me !!!

 

\*\*Extraction is Brutal\*\*

 The women scream when exposed to sunlight. Some try to claw their way back into the cave, while others sob, claiming that their bodies “don’t feel real anymore.”

 Back at the ranger station, no medical condition can explain their behavior. All the women are alive, with no physical trauma. However, something within them is broken.

 

\*\*Post-Mission Debrief, Flagstaff, Motel Room\*\*

 The squad sits in silence. No joking, no post-operation decompressing.

 Martinez lights a cigarette. “We didn’t get away. We survived.”

 

Lou stares out the window, looking toward the trees before responding. “Whatever that thing was… it didn’t kill them. It changed them, and I honestly don’t know what’s worse.”

 

Gonzales asks softly, “So what are we fighting?”

 

Lou replies, “This is still a Skinwalker, just more lore than we expected”

That night, as they prepare to return home, Lou quietly writes “” in his personal journal—a reminder.

 

This was just the beginning.

 

\*\*Psalm 13: Case File 001.2\*\* 

\*\*“Skinwalker Hollow” – Part II: The Key in the Pines\*\* 

 

\*\*Location:\*\* Private cabin outside Flagstaff. 

\*\*Time:\*\* 3:47 a.m. 

\*\*Weather:\*\* Clear. Moonless. Coyotes silent. 

 

The team is gathered around a worn kitchen table, each man awake despite the hour. No one has said much since they got the women out. 

 

They’re in the next room—alive, but not awake. Bodies limp. Mouths whispering fragments of thoughts that don’t sound like their own. 

 

Kayla Morgan stares at the ceiling, murmuring, 

“I’m still under the tree. Don’t leave my skin. It doesn’t fit right.” 

 

Medina rubs his temples. 

“This ain’t right, man. They’re here… but they’re not.” 

 

Vega interjects, 

“You saw them try to walk back into the woods. Like something was pulling them home.” 

 

Gonzales speaks quietly, 

“They’re possessed, bro.” 

 

Martinez is the last to speak, slow and firm. 

“No. They’re tethered.” 

 

He stands, moving to the wall where Lou had started drawing a rough map of the woods. He circles a canyon ridge, where they had found the women. 

 

Martinez continues, 

“This thing… the main one… it’s not just feeding. It’s nesting. Marking them—for prey it intends to come back for.” 

 

Lou steps forward, his voice low and controlled. 

“Then we cut the tether.”

 

\*\*Next Morning.\*\* 

 

The women are still whispering, but one of them—Maya Grant, the first woman who disappeared—begins to break the pattern. 

“You’ll find it beneath the thorns.” 

“Only fire breaks the mask.” 

“It still remembers the voice of the old blood.” 

 

The squad locks eyes. 

 

Medina mutters, 

“Is she talking riddles or is this—” 

 

Lou interrupts, 

“Clues.” 

 

They realize something chilling: the Skinwalker has a central form, unlike the shapeshifting fragments they encountered. It is a root. An alpha. 

 

And it still wears the form of someone it once was. 

 

Maya whispers one last thing before collapsing into silence: 

“He walks without skin, but wears your guilt.” 

 

\*\*Decision Made.\*\* 

 

 

This time, they won’t split up. They will go in as one. 

 

No flares. No tech chatter. Just steel, and fire. 

 

“We find the source,” Lou says, tightening his chest rig. 

“We kill it. And we set them free.” 

 

As they prepare their gear, Martinez passes a flask of whiskey. Nolasco sharpens an obsidian blade with Navajo origins. Gonzales mounts thermal scopes—eyes that see heat, not masks. 

 

Vega loads dragon’s breath shells. Just in case.   

 

\*\*Midnight Return.\*\* 

 

They reach the place the women were found. Lou spots something they missed before: 

 

A wide gash in the earth, where the trees grow in a perfect circle, bark blackened, and the air humming like a distant scream. 

 

Beneath the roots, they find bones—hundreds, some human, some animal—all arranged like a crude altar. 

 

And in the center— 

 

A figure. 

 

Tall. Skinless. Limbs too long. Face a perfect imitation of Lou’s brother, Jeff. 

 

But it isn’t Jeff. 

 

It smiles with rotting teeth and says, 

“Brother.” 

 

Lou doesn’t blink. His tunnel vision kicks in. His blood goes cold. His vision narrows. 

 

CRACK-CRACK-CRACK.

 

Lou fired three rounds center mass.

 

Too fast.

 

The Skinwalker twisted unnaturally and darted through the trees like liquid muscle. Bark exploded from the trunks it grazed. It vanished into the black.

 

Lou didn’t hesitate.

Dropped his rifle. Drew his sidearm. Moved fast.

 

Another blur—too late.

 

It crashed into Lou like a falling tree, claws slashing. Lou went down hard.

 

It pinned him, leaned close, and whispered in Jeff’s voice:

 

\> “You should have , little brother.”

 

 

The rage ignited.

 

Lou didn’t scream. He only hyperventilated

 

He headbutted the monster so hard it staggered back.

 

Rolled with the momentum—came up swinging.

 

A straight right to the jaw, a left hook that cracked bone. A body shot that echoed like wood splitting.

 

The Skinwalker reeled.

 

It had never—never—been hit like this.

 

Not by prey.

 

Lou closed in, stalking, brutal.

 

Olympic wrestling footwork. Elbows like hammers. Knees like steel.

 

Five strikes. Six. Seven.

Blood—not human—splashed against tree bark.

 

The Skinwalker shrieked in a voice that wasn’t Jeff’s anymore.

 

It scrambled back, claws raised. But Lou didn’t let up.

 

He grabbed its arm, snapped it at the joint, then drove his knee into its chest—right where its heart pulsed, hanging outside the ribs like a tumor.

 

Lou grabbed his combat knife.

The handle was wrapped in tape.

Fuck you was carved into the steel.

 

He plunged the blade deep in the skinwalkers throat

.

 

The Skinwalker screamed—not from its throat, but from everywhere.

 

The earth around them trembled. A wave of shrieks echoed through the forest. The tether was breaking.

 

And then…

 

Silence.

 

The Skinwalker collapsed. The illusion of Jeff’s face peeled away like wet paper. Just bone underneath.

 

It was dead.

 

Really dead.

 

 

\---

 

Back at the cabin.

 

The women—Kayla, Maya, the others—woke up.

 

No more whispers. No more sleepwalking.

 

Maya looked at Lou as tears spilled down her cheeks.

 

\> “You... you brought me back.”

 

 

 

Lou didn’t say anything.

 

He just stepped outside, breathing hard, fists still clenched.

 

Martinez followed, setting a hand on his shoulder.

 

“You good, brother?”

 

Lou’s eyes were fixed on the treeline.

 

“No,” he said.

 

 

Martinez nodded.

 

\*\*Psalm 13 – Campfire Debrief\*\* 

\*Location: Backwoods cabin outside Flagstaff\* 

\*Time: 3:11 a.m.\*

 

The fire crackled. No one had spoken in ten minutes.

 

Not because they had nothing to say.

 

But because they didn't know how to say it.

 

Lou was inside, washing off dark blood in silence. Outside, the rest of them sat in a rough circle, surrounded by empty beer cans and scarred faces—ghosts haunted by something worse than death:

 

A new reality.

 

Gonzales was the first to break the silence.

 

“Bro, did anyone else see that? Like—actually see it?”

 

Vega nodded slowly, his eyes wide.

 

“He beat it to death. With his hands. That thing was like a fucking demon, and Lou turned it into mulch.”

 

Medina gave a half-laugh, half-wince, still wrapping a cut on his forearm.

 

“Dude, I threw a flashbang at it and ran. Lou? Lou charged at it. Who the hell does that?”

 

Nolasco just stared into the fire.

 

“That wasn’t adrenaline. That was something else. It was… primal. Cold. I’ve seen UFC fighters break jaws, but he went for the heart, man.”

 

Silence hung in the air for a moment. Then Martinez leaned forward, his voice low.

 

“You boys remember Lous first day at the unit? Remember how he was back then?”

 

They all did.

 

Quiet. Watchful. First one up and the last one to eat. He took punches in training without flinching. He didn’t smile much, but when he did, you remembered it.

 

Martinez exhaled slowly, like smoke leaving his chest.

 

“I trained that kid. I saw what he had early on. But what he did back there? That wasn’t just skill. That was pain. Controlled. Directed. Weaponized.”

 

Medina shook his head in disbelief.

 

“If that thing had a soul, Lou beat it out of its body.”

 

Gonzales looked around, dead serious.

 

“So… does this make Lou the boogeyman now?”

 

Vega smirked.

“Nah. Calling Lou the boogeyman would be disrespectful.”

 

That finally broke the tension, and a ripple of chuckles passed through the group—a nervous relief.

 

But beneath it all lay respect, fear, and the beginning of something bigger.

 

Martinez stood up and looked toward the cabin.

 

“He’s not normal. He’s never been. But whatever’s coming next? We follow him.”

 

One by one, they all nodded.

 

Because Lou wasn’t just the muscle.

 

He was the compass now.

 

 

Psalm 13 – Chapter: Ghost Returns

Location: Northern Arizona – Desert Safehouse

Time: 10:04 a.m. – Two Weeks After the Flagstaff Incident

 

The safehouse hummed with quiet purpose.

 

Wires fed into the walls, solar panels buzzed softly on the roof, and Medina had finally patched the uplink to encrypted channels. The team was building the skeleton of something bigger—a mission, a watchtower, a sanctuary for the damned who still fought back.

 

But upstairs, in the quiet of an empty room with no personal effects, Lou Phillips stared at the mirror.

 

The face looking back wasn’t the boy his parents buried.

That boy had soft eyes. A crooked smile. Hope.

 

Now?

 

Now he looked like the thing Jeff left behind.

 

 

 

Outside the Safehouse

 

Martinez leaned against the front porch rail, arms crossed, watching as Lou stepped into the Arizona daylight. Lou wore a plain hoodie and jeans—no body armor, no rifle. Just his .45 and the photograph of his parents tucked in a breast pocket.

 

“You sure about this?” Martinez asked, voice low.

 

 

 

Lou nodded once.

 

“I was supposed to be in that coffin. They buried a casket full of ash and lies. I owe them more than that. Do you remember what you said  my subconscious, do you know what popped in my head first.

 

Martinez answered. “Jeff ? “

 

Lou replied.

 

“No my parents before they died, its been so long since I thought about them as they. All I’ve ever remembered was blood.” 

 

Martinez didn’t try to stop him.

 

He just handed him a folded cloth—a small, embroidered square. It was a stitched Psalm verse, frayed at the edges. Something from basic training. Something Martinez kept, for all these years.

 

“Give it to them. Tell ’em their boy became something.”

 

Lou tucked it into his jacket.

 

Two days Later – Brookpine Cemetery, New Jersey

Overcast. Cold. Quiet.

 

The cemetery gates creaked open on hinges that hadn’t been oiled in a decade. Lou moved through it like a shadow. Hoodie drawn up. Head low. Not a soul recognized him—not the groundskeeper, not the old woman laying roses by a soldier’s headstone.

 

He found the plot on instinct. It had haunted his dreams for years.

Two headstones side by side.

 

Margaret Woods

Beloved Wife. Mother. Never Forgotten.

 

Peter Woods

Marine. Protector. Devoted Father.

 

And next to them, a third:

 

Louis Woods

1999 – 2013

Gone too soon. But never alone.

 

Lou stood there for a long time. His throat tightened.

He knelt.

 

“I’m sorry,” he whispered.

 

The wind picked up. Leaves scattered like ashes. “He came for me. He took everything. But I’m still here. I shouldn’t be… but I am.”

 

He set the stitched cloth from Martinez between the stones, pressing it into the dirt.

 

“I’m not that scared kid anymore. I became someone. Someone who hunts monsters.”

 

His hand trembled. For a moment, just a moment—he felt like that boy again.

 

“I’ll make him pay. Not just for me. For you. For all of you

Brookpine Cemetery – Late Afternoon

 

The air had grown colder. Clouds pressed low against the earth like they were grieving too.

 

Lou stood still between the headstones, the stitched cloth now half-buried in soil. Wind stirred the trees. A crow called somewhere in the distance.

 

Then—footsteps.

 

Soft, deliberate.

 

Coming from behind him.

 

Lou didn’t move. He didn’t reach for the .45 at his back.

He just waited.

 

Whoever it was didn’t feel like a threat.

Not to him.

 

“You knew him?” a voice asked behind him. Female. Low. Hollow in that way only grief could make it.

 

 

 

He turned his head slightly.

 

The woman stood in dark clothes. A hood. Pale skin. Jet-black hair that curled slightly around her face. Her eyes were distant, sunken with memory. The tone of her voice suggested she'd been carrying pain for a long, long time.

 

“Knew who?” Lou asked.

 

She looked at the grave. At the name: Louis Woods.

 

“The boy. Lou. I… I used to know him. Long time ago.”

 

 

 

Lou turned now. Fully. Faced her.

 

And then he said it. “Yeah… I knew him.”

 

 

 

The woman’s brow furrowed. She tilted her head.

 

Then her eyes scanned his face.

 

And froze.

 

“…No.”

 

Lou said nothing.

 

She stepped forward slowly, almost afraid to get closer—like seeing him too clearly might shatter something inside her. Her hands trembled. Her lips parted. But no words came out.

 

“You’re dead,” she whispered. “I went to your funeral. I—Lou, I saw your face in my nightmares. Jeff…”

 

Lou nodded once. “I know.”

And just like that, she stopped breathing. Or maybe she remembered she hadn’t been breathing in years.

 

“Lou…” Her voice cracked.

 

He just looked at her—calm, steady.

 

Not afraid. Not confused. Not surprised.

 

“Jane.”

 

It hit her like a bullet to the chest.

 

Her knees almost buckled, but she caught herself. She hadn’t cried in years. Couldn’t. But something inside her shifted. For the first time since her death… she felt something. Something warm. Alive.

 

“You’re alive.”

 

 

 

Lou gave a faint smile—almost nothing. But it meant everything.

 

“You too,” he said.

 

 

 

Her expression darkened just slightly.

 

“Not really.”

 

 

 

He tilted his head slightly. Looking closer now.

 

Lou’s eyes were trained to spot threats. Trauma. Movement. Energy.

And now… he saw it.

 

Something behind her. Not human. A presence.

 

It coiled around her like a shadow with too much weight.

Not evil. But not merciful either.

 

It watched Lou with something close to… confusion.

 

It had carried Jane across the veil, kept her going—fueled her hate, her mission.

But Lou?

 

Lou didn’t register like other men.

 

He wasn’t cursed.

He wasn’t blessed.

He was… something else.

 

It whispered—but not in a language he knew. He ignored it.

 

His eyes never left Jane.

 

“Does it hurt?” Lou asked quietly.

 

 

 

She looked down.

 

“No. That’s the problem. Nothing does.”

 

 

 

He took a breath. Not pity. Not judgment.

 

“You still you?”

 

 

 

She nodded. Slowly.

 

“Most days. The rest… I fake.”

 

 

 

Lou nodded once, accepting it without hesitation.

 

“Good. Then we’re both ghosts.”

 

 

 

She looked up at him again. And for a flicker of a second—she smiled.

Brookpine Cemetery – Dusk

 

They stood in silence for a while.

The wind had softened. The world around them had gone still, like the dead themselves were listening.

 

Jane stared at the grave, lips parted, a faint tremble in her jaw. The woman known to the world as Jane the Killer—a name whispered like a curse—looked… small.

 

Not weak.

Just human again.

 

“Why are you here, Lou?”

 

 

 

Lou looked up at the sky.

 

“I owed them a goodbye.”

 

 

 

“You were gone a long time.”

 

 

 

“Had to be. The world thought I was dead.”

(He glanced sideways at her)

“You too.”

 

 

 

She nodded. Quiet. Her hair moved slightly with the breeze, but her feet stayed planted like she wasn’t sure she was allowed to leave.

 

“You killed a lot of people,” Lou said bluntly.

 

 

 

She winced.

 

But he didn’t flinch. Didn’t accuse. Didn’t raise his voice.

 

Just said it like a fact.

 

“They deserved it,” she replied, coldly. “Every one of them. Rapists. Predators. Monsters in suits. I made sure.”

 

 

 

“Still killed ‘em,” Lou said, eyes narrowing.

“And it cost you.”

 

 

 

That silence again. Heavy.

 

“Do you still feel anything?” he asked.

 

 

 

“Only when I saw you.”

 

Lou replied

“ Sounds like hope.”

 

He nodded, as if that made sense.

 

“Then come with me.”

 

 

 

She blinked.

 

“What?”

 

 

 

“Come with me. Back to Arizona. I got a place. People who trust me. We’re building something. You don’t have to kill anymore. Just be there.”

 

 

 

She looked at him like he was speaking a foreign language.

 

“You… trust me?”

 

 

 

“I know what Jeff did to you,” he said simply. “I know what it made you into. But I don’t see a killer. I see somebody trying to crawl back toward the light. Even if your hands are covered in blood.”

 

 

 

Jane looked away. The entity around her seemed to twist, reacting. But Lou never looked at it.

 

Only her.

 

“No one’s looked at me like that since before it all went to hell.”

 

“Then maybe it’s time someone did.”

 

 

 

 

 

The Drive – Arizona Bound

Three hours later.

 

The desert stretched out on either side.

 

Lou’s truck rolled through the dark,

Jane sat in the passenger seat. Hair tied back now. Hood off. She kept stealing glances at him.

 

“You drive like a cop,” she muttered.

 

 

 

Lou smirked faintly.

 

“Seriously?”

 

 

She nodded slowly, watching him.

 

“So what have you been doing? These past years?”

 

 

 

Lou exhaled.

 

“Army. Green Beret. Got out. But I couldn’t stay still. Found others like me. Started hunting the real threats. Not people. Things.”

 

 

 

Her brows knit together.

 

“Like what?”

 

“Cryptids. Cursed entities. Things that don’t belong in this world. Stuff we thought were stories.”

 

“And you just… decided to fight them?”

 

“Someone had to.”

 

 

 

She looked out the window for a moment. Then back at him.

 

“Far cry from the quiet boy that followed his older brother around.”

 

Lou replied

 I’m trying. Same as you.”

 

 

 

Another beat of silence.

 

“Why are you helping me, Lou?”

 

“Because I remember who you were before Jeff took everything from you . And I think that girl’s still in there.”

 

Jane looked down at her hands. For once, they didn’t look like weapons.

 

“I don’t want to hurt anyone anymore.”

 

“Then don’t.”

 

Lou pulled off the highway. The outline of the safehouse glowed faintly in the distance—warm, waiting.

 

“Home?” she asked.

 

 

 

“Yeah. For now. I have a Cabin close by”

 

She leaned her head against the window.

 

“Sounds nice.”

 

 

Psalm 13 Safehouse – Arizona

 

The air smelled like sweat, cedar, and gun oil. A punching bag swung lazily from a new support beam as Vega and Gonzales tried to hook up a flat screen. Martinez was barking orders, shirt off, sawdust clinging to his chest hair like war paint.

 

“Medina! That door frame is crooked again, I swear I’ll duct tape your skull to the goddamn level!”

 

The sound of tires crunching gravel cut through the heat.

 

The truck stopped. Doors opened. First came Lou—stone-faced

 

Then came her.

 

Jane stepped out, eyes shielded by her hood. Black hoodie. Pale hands.

 

The squad went quiet like wolves sniffing something unnatural.

 

“Uh…” Gonzales squinted. “Lou? You bring a fan?”

 

Jane didn’t blink.

 

“Only if she’s here to kill us,” Vega muttered, half-joking, half-not.

 

“Dibs on haunting the TV,” Medina added.

 

Martinez turned slowly from the wall he was hammering.

“Who is she?”

Lou didn’t break stride.

 

“This is Jane Arkensaw.”

 

“The Jane?” Gonzales asked. “Jane the Killer?”

 

Jane cocked her head slightly. “That’s what they call me.”

 

Gonzales looked her up and down, paused, then said:

 

“Huh. Thought you’d be taller.”

 

The squad laughed.

 

Jane blinked again. Confused.

 

“That’s an odd reaction?”

 

Martinez finally stepped forward. Not smiling. Not hostile.

 

“Look,” he said. “We’ve seen demons. The real kind. Heard things cry in languages older than sin. If Lou brought you here, that’s all we need to know.”

 

He pointed at her chest—not to intimidate, but to ground her.

 

“You don’t answer to the world anymore. Not here.”

 

 

She stared at him. At the weight of his words. For the first time in years, she felt something unfamiliar: safe.

 

“Also,” Martinez added, “if you’re gonna live here, we’re doing movie night every Friday. First pick’s yours unless you choose Twilight—in which case, back to the woods you go.”

 

Gonzales cackled. “Let her stay, bro. She looks like she could beat Vega’s ass.”

 

“She probably could,” Vega admitted.

 

The team eased around her like she’d always been there.

 

And just like that, Jane wasn’t a monster.

 

She was one of the boys.

 

 

 

Later That Night – Rooftop

 

Jane sat on the roof alone, legs pulled in close. The desert stretched out like a burned canvas, the moon pale and bruised.

 

Inside her, the entity stirred.

 

Its voice came like the echo of a memory behind glass.

 

(He is not what he seems.)

 

“Lou?”

 

 

 

(There is… familiarity. I felt it when you stood beside him. Like something I once knew. Long ago.)

 

“You don’t remember anything from before me.”

 

 

 

(I didn’t. But now—there’s a… warmth. Like the edge of a fire I’ve forgotten how to build.)

 

“What does that mean?”

 

 

 

(It means I am older than you know. And he is not just man.)

 

Jane looked toward the backyard, where Lou was sitting alone with a whiskey bottle and an old Bible on the table.

 

The squad had let her be. No lectures. No fear. Just dumb jokes and muscle and trust.

 

“He called me human.”

 

 

 

(That’s why it hurts.)

 

“What?”

 

 

 

(Because for the first time in years… you almost believe him.)

 

Jane exhaled slowly, resting her forehead against her knees.

 

“I don’t know what he is,” she whispered.

 

 

 

(Neither do I.)

 

 

Morning – Psalm 13 Safehouse Yard

 

The sun was barely up, turning the sky a soft burnt orange. The Arizona desert buzzed low with life. Wind swept through mesquite trees and the scent of coffee and gun oil drifted in the air.

 

Jane stood on the back porch of the safehouse, hood still up, watching.

 

She didn’t speak. Didn’t move.

 

She just watched.

 

Out in the yard, chaos lived in harmony.

 

Vega and Gonzales were dragging sandbags into a combat pit they’d been building out of tires and plywood. Martinez stood nearby, barking half-serious criticisms while casually fixing a jammed M4. Nolasco hit the heavy bag with clean, practiced elbows. But the real star…

 

Was Medina.

 

Shirtless. Again.

 

He was trying to vault over a stack of ammo crates and do some sort of reverse roll he saw in a movie.

 

“Medina,” Martinez snapped, not even looking up, “if you pull your back doing Power Ranger shit again, I swear to God I’m gonna leak your Icloud photos

 

 

 

“Let him work, bro!” Gonzales laughed. “His shirt’s already off, he’s in character.”

 

 

 

“Man hasn’t worn a shirt since we raided that haunted Waffle House,” Vega added. “It’s part of his religion now.”

 

 

 

Jane blinked, arms folded, half-expecting this to descend into violence. But it didn’t. It was loud. Dumb. And strangely warm.

 

Lou stepped out beside her, sipping coffee from a chipped wooden mug.

 

“Every mission,” he said without looking at her, “his shirt ends up off.”

 

 

 

Jane glanced sideways at him.

 

“Every mission?”

 

 

 

“Even coffee runs.”

 

 

 

“Why?”

 

 

 

“No one knows. We stopped asking. We just… accept it.”

 

“Is he…?”

 

“I don’t think so, He had a girlfriend.”

 

Jane huffed. Almost a laugh.

 

“You’re serious.”

 

“Dead.”

 

 

 

They stood there in silence, watching Medina trip on a rake and pretend he didn’t.

 

Then Lou turned slightly, nodding toward the yard.

 

“This is the training ground. We run drills here. Test gear. Beat the hell out of each other when words don’t work.”

 

 

 

Jane’s expression hardened.

 

“You let them beat each other up?”

 

 

 

“Better us than what’s out there.”

 

 

 

She watched a moment longer. Nolasco offered Vega a glove tap. Vega nodded, dropped into a boxing stance. The hits were hard but controlled. Clean. Respectful.

 

“They listen to you,” Jane said.

 

 

 

“Sometimes.”

 

 

 

“And this place—”

 

 

 

“It’s the only thing keeping us sane.”

 

 

 

Jane slowly descended the porch steps. The dirt crunched under her boots.

 

“They don’t treat me like I’m broken,” she murmured.

 

 

 

Lou looked her dead in the eyes.

 

“Because you’re not, Jeff’s broken.”

 

 

 

She flinched—not from pain, but something worse. Hope.

 

She turned away quickly, arms crossed again.

 

“I don’t know what I am anymore.”

 

 

 

Lou shrugged.

 

“Start with what you want to be.”

 

 

 

She looked back to the yard, where Medina now attempted a flying knee at a punching bag that was not ready for it.

 

The others cheered.

 

Jane let out a small breath.

 

Something in her chest stirred. The weight didn’t vanish, but it shifted.

 

For the first time in years…

 

She wanted to protect something.

 

Safehouse Yard – Midmorning

 

The sun was climbing higher now, casting sharp shadows across the sand. Medina had finally put a shirt back on—though it looked temporary—and the rest of the squad had dispersed for various tasks. The yard buzzed with easy rhythm. Jane sat on an old crate near the perimeter wall, sharpening a blade more out of habit than need.

 

Martinez walked up slow, boots crunching gravel.

 

“That’s a custom blade?” he asked, squinting as he lit a cigarette.

 

 

 

Jane didn’t look up.

 

“Made it myself.”

 

 

 

“Looks like it could shave bark off a redwood.”

 

 

 

She smirked. A little.

 

“Only if I like the tree.”

 

 

 

Martinez exhaled smoke through his nose, crouching nearby, elbows resting on his knees. Silence hung comfortably before he finally broke it.

 

“You knew him before all this.”

 

 

 

Jane’s hands paused on the blade.

 

“Yeah.”

 

 

 

Martinez looked out over the yard—toward the makeshift weight bench Lou had built from a steel axle and two truck tires.

 

“Never said much about the past. But I know pain when I see it.”

 

 

 

Jane set the blade down, her voice quieter now.

 

“Lou wasn’t just some good kid. He was… decent in a way most people grow out of. He looked people in the eye. He believed in things.”

 

 

 

“Still does,” Martinez muttered. “Even if it burns him.”

 

 

 

She nodded.

 

“After what Jeff did… he should’ve died. You know that, right? He was declared dead. Official. Body bag and everything.”

 

 

 

Martinez turned to look at her now.

 

“You were there?”

 

“I was there before. At the house. Before Jeff went full monster.

 

 

 

He thought Jeff was just angry. Lashing out. But Jeff…”

 

 

 

Her voice faltered. Her eyes dropped to the ground.

 

“Jeff wasn’t human anymore.”

 

 

 

She swallowed hard.

 

Later, I found out—Lou crawled. Five miles. Throat cut. Face slashed. Barely breathing. Just dragging himself through the dirt.” Then he came for me and my family.

Jane stopped there

 

 

 

 

Martinez stiffened. He hadn’t known that part.

 

“Jesus…”

 

 

 

“No one should’ve survived that. But he did. They found him just before dawn. Hands were ground raw. Body shredded. They said it looked like he'd been hunted by a pack of animals. But he kept going.”

 

 

 

Martinez took a long drag from his cigarette.

 

“That’s why he’s the way he is.”

 

 

 

“He doesn’t hate Jeff,” Jane said, looking at Martinez for the first time. “Not the way I do. Lou… hates what Jeff took from him. What he almost turned into.”

 

 

 

Martinez looked down at his boots.

 

“We saw pieces of it. The tunnel vision. That look he gets in combat. Like he’s not seeing them. He’s seeing Jeff.”

 

 

 

Jane nodded slowly.

 

“Yeah. But even then, he still pulls back. Still refuses to become the thing that hurt him.”

 

 

 

“He ever talk to you about God?”

 

 

 

Jane nodded again.

 

“A few times. He said if he ever let go of that thread, he’d never come back.”

 

 

 

Martinez dropped the cigarette and crushed it beneath his heel.

 

“That thread’s the only reason we follow him. Because he never cut it—even when it would’ve been easier.”

 

 

 

A silence stretched between them again, deeper this time.

 

Finally, Martinez stood up, brushing dust from his knees.

 

“I’m glad you’re here. Just so you know.”

 

Jane Replied

 

“I wasn’t sure I would be welcome.”

 

 

 

“You’re family now. Nobody here’s perfect. We all got blood on our hands. Some of us got more than others… but we’re still standing.”

 

 

 

“Thanks, Martinez.”

 

 

 

“Don’t thank me. Just make sure Medina doesn’t set the damn range on fire again. We’ve only got one.”

 

 

Jane hands Martinez the knife .

 

Martinez asks . Are you sure ?

 

Jane says. If he says I don’t need to fight, I wont

 

Martinez smirks. Just so you know Im giving when he graduates from the rape whistle.

 

Jane replied. So its gonna be a while

 

He turned to walk away, then paused.

 

“You’re the only one he really talks to, you know.”

 

“Lou?”

 

“Yeah. You bring him back. Little by little.”

 

Jane watched him go.

 

Then looked back at the training yard—at the life these men had built in the ashes of monsters.

 

The sun was dipping below the desert ridgeline, casting the landscape in bruised shades of purple and orange. The heat had finally let up. Wind stirred the dust low along the ground. Lou stood near the back of the safehouse, tightening a bolt on a rain barrel setup when he heard soft footsteps approaching.

 

Jane.

 

No words yet. Just the sound of her shoes crunching against gravel. She came to stand beside him, arms crossed but relaxed. She looked out across the property—training yard to the left, the mess area with its crooked picnic table to the right, and beyond that, open sand and cactus stretching into nothingness.

 

“I’ve never been to Arizona,” she said finally.

 

Lou gave a faint nod, still looking straight ahead. “It’s peaceful, if you don’t mind the heat. Rattlesnakes don’t give you much trouble if you show ‘em respect.”

 

“That a metaphor?” she asked, smirking slightly.

 

Lou cracked a smile. Just barely.

 

“No. Just snakes.”

 

They started walking. Slow. No rush. Just silence and boots on the earth.

 

Jane looked around as they moved past the perimeter wire.

 

“Did you build this fence?”

 

“Mostly Martinez. But I tightened the lines.”

 

“It’s neat. Like a fortress.”

 

“We like to sleep knowing there’s at least some warning before something claws through.”

 

They passed the pull-up rig, where Medina had been showing off earlier. The bar was still swaying slightly from his last set.

 

“Your team’s something else,” Jane said.

 

Lou looked toward the horizon, then back at her. “They’re brothers. All earned.”

 

“They don’t look at me like I’m broken.”

 

“You’re not.”

 

Jane turned to face him. Her voice lowered. “You don’t flinch. Not at my scars. Not at my story.”

 

Lou met her gaze. Steady.

 

“I’ve had to carry my own.”

 

She swallowed, eyes briefly shimmering with something distant. “You were a kid. When Jeff did what he did. You shouldn’t have survived.”

 

Lou’s jaw flexed.

 

“I didn’t. Not the version they buried.” He paused. “The one who came back… he had to make peace with the ghosts. Or at least learn to walk beside ‘em.”

 

They stopped at a shed with a rusted door. Lou pulled it open. Inside sat a half-covered old black ’70 Chevelle SS, frame stripped, hood popped, tools laid out in a methodical circle.

 

Jane’s eyes widened slightly. “This yours?”

 

“Used to belong to my dad,” Lou said quietly. I never knew it existed until it was gifted to me by a family friend.

 

She stepped closer, brushing dust off the hood with her fingers.

 

“You ever gonna finish it?”

 

Lou looked at the car like it was a memory that could still breathe.

 

“Yeah. Just been waiting for the right time.”

 

“And now?”

 

Lou didn’t answer right away. Instead, he crouched beside the car, brushing his fingers over the exposed engine block.

 

“I think I’m ready to stop surviving and start… building.”

 

Jane leaned on the frame, watching him work.

 

“You think someone like me can do that?” she asked, voice almost a whisper.

 

Lou stood. Faced her. Voice calm, certain.

 

“I don’t think you’re someone like anything. You’re you. You made it back. That’s enough to start.”

 

She blinked hard and looked down at the Chevelle.

 

“It’s not perfect,” she said, nodding at the car.

 

“Neither am I.”

 

The wind picked up, carrying the scent of mesquite and engine grease. For a moment, neither of them spoke.

 

Then Lou turned to her again.

 

“You ever want to learn how to fix an engine?”

 

Jane raised an eyebrow. “You offering to teach me?”

 

“Only if you don’t mind swearing a lot when things don’t go right.”

 

She chuckled.

 

“Sounds like therapy.”

 

Lou nodded once.

 

“Sometimes it is.”

You know that moment when you're scrolling through fitness equipment websites at 2 AM, coffee in hand, trying to figure out which bumper plates won't make your neighbors hate you? Yeah, I've been there too. Let me save you some time and sanity here – **Olympic bumper plates with steel inserts** are the real MVP of home gym equipment, and I'm about to tell you exactly why.

After years of dropping, lifting, and occasionally cursing at various weight plates, I've learned that not all bumper plates are created equal. The difference between a quality set and those budget nightmares? It's like comparing a Ferrari to a shopping cart – both have wheels, but that's where the similarities end.

# Why Steel Insert Bumper Plates Rule Your Home Gym

# The Science Behind the Magic

Here's the thing about **rubber bumper plates with steel inserts** – they're basically the Swiss Army knife of weight plates. The rubber gives you that satisfying bounce without destroying your floors (or your downstairs neighbors' ceiling), while the steel collar ensures these bad boys will outlast your current workout motivation.

Ever wondered why Olympic lifters swear by these plates? Simple: they can handle repeated drops from overhead positions without cracking, chipping, or turning into expensive paperweights. The **steel insert** creates a perfect fit around your Olympic barbell, preventing that annoying wobble you get with cheaper alternatives.

[Check out these premium Olympic bumper plates](https://amzn.to/44oaFvQ) that I've been testing in my garage gym.

# Durability That Actually Matters

I'll be honest – I used to think spending extra on quality bumper plates was just fitness marketing BS. Then I watched my budget plates develop stress fractures after six months of regular use. :/ Not fun when you're mid-lift and suddenly questioning whether your equipment is about to fail.

Quality **Olympic bumper plates** with steel inserts typically last 5-10 years of consistent use. Compare that to standard rubber plates that might give you 1-2 years if you're lucky. Do the math – you're actually saving money in the long run.

# What Makes These Plates Special

# Steel Insert Technology

The **steel collar** isn't just there to look pretty. It serves several crucial functions:

• **Perfect fit** on 2-inch Olympic barbells • **Prevents plate deformation** under heavy loads • **Reduces wear** on both plates and barbell sleeves • **Maintains consistent diameter** across different weights

# Rubber Construction Benefits

The rubber exterior isn't just for show either:

• **Floor protection** – no more dents in your garage floor • **Noise reduction** – your neighbors will thank you • **Bounce control** – consistent, predictable rebound • **Weather resistance** – perfect for garage gyms

# Choosing Your Weight Set Configuration

# Standard Home Gym Setup

Most serious lifters start with this configuration:

• **2 x 45lb plates** (essential for most compound movements) • **2 x 25lb plates** (perfect for intermediate loads) • **2 x 15lb plates** (great for warm-ups and technique work) • **2 x 10lb plates** (fine-tuning your lifts)

This gives you a solid **190lb total** to work with, which covers most people's needs for the first year or two.

# Advanced Lifter Setup

Once you outgrow the basics (and trust me, you will), consider adding:

• **Additional 45lb pairs** for heavy deadlifts and squats • **35lb plates** for those in-between weights • **5lb change plates** for micro-loading

# Installation and Setup Tips

# Barbell Compatibility

Make sure you're using a proper **2-inch Olympic barbell**. These plates won't fit on standard 1-inch bars, and forcing them is a recipe for disaster. IMO, if you're investing in quality bumper plates, you need a quality barbell to match.

# Storage Solutions

**Proper storage** extends the life of your plates significantly:

• Use plate trees or wall-mounted storage • Keep plates off the ground when not in use • Avoid stacking different materials together • Store in temperature-controlled environments when possible

[Get the complete weight training setup here](https://amzn.to/44oaFvQ) with everything you need to start lifting properly.

# Maintenance and Longevity

# Daily Care

Taking care of your **Olympic weight plates** isn't rocket science, but consistency matters:

• Wipe down after sweaty sessions • Check for cracks or damage regularly • Rotate usage to prevent uneven wear • Keep away from sharp objects

# Long-term Maintenance

Once a month, give your plates a thorough inspection. Look for:

• **Stress fractures** around the steel insert • **Rubber degradation** on high-contact areas • **Steel collar looseness** (rare but worth checking) • **Diameter consistency** across matching weights

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

# The Budget Trap

Look, I get it – quality bumper plates aren't cheap. But buying cheap plates twice costs more than buying good ones once. Those $50 plate sets you see online? They're not going to last, and they might not even weigh what they claim to weigh.

# Mixing Plate Types

Don't mix bumper plates with iron plates on the same bar for dropping movements. The different heights create uneven stress distribution, and you'll end up damaging both types of plates.

# Improper Dropping Technique

Even the best **rubber bumper plates** have limits. Learn proper dropping technique – control the descent and don't just let gravity do all the work.

# Budget Considerations and Value

# Price Ranges

Here's what you can expect to pay for quality **Olympic bumper plates with steel inserts**:

• **Budget range**: $1.50-2.00 per pound • **Mid-range**: $2.00-3.00 per pound  
• **Premium**: $3.00+ per pound

Remember, this is a **long-term investment** in your health and fitness. Spending an extra $200 now can save you $500+ in replacements over the next decade.

# Value Calculation

When calculating value, consider:

• **Lifespan** (5-10 years vs 1-2 years) • **Resale value** (quality plates hold their value) • **Injury prevention** (consistent equipment reduces risk) • **Performance consistency** (accurate weights improve training)

# Final Thoughts and Recommendations

After testing dozens of different **bumper plate sets** over the years, I can confidently say that investing in quality Olympic bumper plates with steel inserts is one of the smartest decisions you can make for your home gym.

These plates will outlast your current workout program, your next three fitness goals, and probably your current barbell if you're not careful. The combination of durability, functionality, and long-term value makes them essential equipment for anyone serious about strength training.

The steel insert technology ensures a perfect fit every time, while the rubber construction protects your equipment, your floors, and your relationship with your neighbors. What more could you ask for?

Ready to upgrade your home gym with equipment that actually lasts? Your future self will thank you for making the investment in quality **Olympic weight plates** that can handle whatever you throw at them – literally.

1lfi567,https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanticAdvice/comments/1lfi567/figuring_things_out/,Figuring things out…,"Recently went on a date with a girl I liked, picked her up from her house with flowers, opened doors for her etc; trying to be chivalrous. We went and got coffee and pastries and went for a walk; Half way through the date I kinda sensed that she wasn’t giving off the same energy that I was, so I dialled back the romantic energy I was putting forth and just tried to have a good time. 

After I dropped her off I texted her later to check in and say that I had a great time and would love to do it again, maybe even something more romantic next time. She responded saying she also had a great time, but unfortunately sent mixed signals and was still processing her past breakup so she needed time to figure things out— but still wanted to do things together and be friends. 

Haven’t texted or spoke to since then, which hurts but I know I need to give her space. I’m still really into her, and obviously would love to see where things could go between us when she’s ready; how can I be supportive and still friendly but give that space needed to figure things out so she can decide if she WANTS me or just liked having me around? 

Curious to see what advice people have— and please don’t just say ignore her and move on cause that doesn’t feel right to me at all (not waiting around for her forever, but cutting this off feels rude and not the right move)",2,1750357537.0,RomanticAdvice,1,1.0,False

It's not a burnt flavour, but it's not the flavour I associate with coffee. I've tried multiple different beans -- today I tried some from Panama which I'm using very successfully for V60 -- and grind sizes -- tried 50 on the DF54. The ratio I'm using is 15 g of coffee (a full basket) to about 120 g of water (just below the valve). I've tried brewing with room temperature water and with boiling water. I've tried brewing on very low heat and high heat. I've found that whatever I do the coffee tastes mostly the same.

1lfi1iw,https://i.redd.it/1pqmgcerex7f1.jpeg,The Ultimate Stella Ryder Crossbody Bag Guide: Why This Accessory is Your New Best Friend,"Hey there, bag enthusiasts! :) Ever find yourself juggling keys, phone, wallet, and that random lip balm that somehow always ends up at the bottom of your purse? Yeah, we've all been there. That's exactly why I fell head-over-heels for crossbody bags – and specifically, why the **Stella Ryder crossbody bag** has become my go-to accessory for, well, pretty much everything.

Let me tell you something: after years of shoulder bags that slide off and clutches that require a third hand, discovering the perfect crossbody was like finding the holy grail of handbags. And trust me, I've tried them all.

# What Makes the Stella Ryder Crossbody Bag Special?

Listen, I'm not usually one to gush over accessories, but this bag? It's different. The **Stella Ryder crossbody bag** isn't just another pretty face in the world of handbags – it's got substance, style, and that perfect balance of form and function that makes you wonder why you ever carried anything else.

# Design That Actually Makes Sense

First things first – the **crossbody design** is pure genius. You know that feeling when you're trying to dig through your bag while holding coffee, groceries, and your dignity? With a crossbody, your hands are free, and your bag stays put. No more awkward shoulder adjustments or watching your purse slide into the abyss of your car seat.

The Stella Ryder takes this concept and runs with it. The **adjustable strap** means whether you're 5'2"" or 6'0"", this bag will sit exactly where you want it. And can we talk about the **multiple compartments**? Finally, a bag that understands that your phone charger and your lipstick shouldn't be playing hide-and-seek in the same pocket.

[Check out the Stella Ryder Crossbody Bag here](https://amzn.to/44oaFvQ)

# Materials That Don't Mess Around

Here's where things get interesting. The **quality of materials** in the Stella Ryder crossbody bag is what separates it from those cheap knockoffs that fall apart after a month. We're talking about:

• **Durable synthetic leather** that looks and feels like the real deal • **Reinforced stitching** that won't give up on you mid-grocery run • **Water-resistant coating** because life happens (and so does rain) • **Heavy-duty zippers** that actually zip without getting stuck

I've put this bag through the wringer – airport security lines, music festivals, that one time I accidentally dropped it in a puddle (don't ask) – and it's still going strong.

# Size Matters: Finding Your Perfect Fit

Ever wonder why some crossbody bags look amazing on your friend but terrible on you? It's not just about personal style – it's about **proportions** and **sizing**. The Stella Ryder comes in dimensions that work for most body types, but here's the thing: **size isn't just about looks**.

# The Goldilocks Zone of Crossbody Bags

The Stella Ryder hits that sweet spot – not too big that you look like you're carrying camping gear, not so small that you can barely fit your essentials. We're talking about enough space for:

• **Phone** (even those ridiculously large smartphones) • **Wallet** or card holder • **Keys** with that oversized keychain you can't part with • **Sunglasses** in their case • **Emergency snacks** (because priorities) • **Small makeup items** for touch-ups

# Versatility: From Brunch to Business

This is where the Stella Ryder crossbody bag really shines. **Versatility** isn't just a buzzword here – it's the whole point. I've worn this bag with everything from yoga pants to that little black dress that makes me feel like I have my life together.

# Styling Options That Don't Quit

The beauty of a well-designed crossbody like the Stella Ryder is that it adapts to your outfit, not the other way around. Whether you're going for:

• **Casual weekend vibes** – throw it on with jeans and a sweater • **Professional polish** – pairs surprisingly well with blazers and work attire • **Night out energy** – adjusts short for a hip, contemporary look • **Travel companion** – wear it under your jacket for security

The **neutral color options** mean you're not stuck with a bag that only matches one outfit. Smart move, right?

# The Practical Side: Features That Actually Matter

Let's get real for a minute. A bag can be gorgeous, but if it's not **functional**, what's the point? The Stella Ryder crossbody bag gets this balance right with features that make everyday life easier:

# Organization That Makes Sense

• **Multiple interior pockets** keep small items from becoming lost causes • **Exterior zip pocket** for items you need quick access to • **Card slots** built right in (FYI, this is a game-changer) • **Secure main compartment** with reliable closure

# Comfort Features You'll Actually Notice

The **padded strap** might seem like a small detail, but after wearing this bag for hours, you'll appreciate it. No more strap marks on your shoulder or that uncomfortable digging sensation.

# Quality vs. Price: The Real Talk

Okay, let's address the elephant in the room – **price**. Quality crossbody bags can range from ""impulse buy"" to ""small car payment,"" and figuring out where the Stella Ryder fits can be tricky.

Here's my take: this bag sits in that sweet spot where you get **premium features** without the premium price tag. You're paying for:

• **Durable construction** that won't leave you bagless after a few months • **Thoughtful design** that considers actual daily use • **Aesthetic appeal** that doesn't compromise function • **Brand reliability** with customer service that cares

# Value Comparison

When I compare the Stella Ryder to similar bags in the market, it consistently outperforms in the **value department**. You're getting designer-inspired looks with practical functionality at a fraction of what you'd pay for comparable designer pieces.

# Care and Maintenance: Keeping It Fresh

Nobody talks about this enough, but maintaining your crossbody bag properly can extend its life significantly. The Stella Ryder is pretty low-maintenance, but here are some tips:

• **Regular cleaning** with appropriate materials • **Proper storage** when not in use • **Avoiding overloading** (I know, easier said than done) • **Treating stains** promptly instead of hoping they'll disappear

# The Verdict: Is the Stella Ryder Right for You?

After months of daily use, I can honestly say the **Stella Ryder crossbody bag** has earned its spot in my everyday rotation. It's not perfect – no bag is – but it comes pretty close to hitting all the marks that matter.

**Who should consider this bag?** • Anyone looking for hands-free convenience • People who prioritize organization and accessibility • Style-conscious individuals who don't want to sacrifice function • Anyone tired of bags that look great but fail in real-world use

**Who might want to look elsewhere?** • Those who need extra-large capacity for work or travel • People who prefer traditional handbag styles • Anyone looking for ultra-minimalist design

The bottom line? If you're in the market for a **reliable, stylish, and functional crossbody bag** that won't break the bank, the Stella Ryder deserves serious consideration. It's one of those purchases that makes you wonder why you waited so long to upgrade.

**Ready to make the switch?** Your shoulders (and your sanity) will thank you. Trust me on this one – sometimes the best accessory is the one that just works, day after day, without any drama. And in my experience, that's exactly what the Stella Ryder crossbody bag delivers.",1,1750357290.0,TheBeautyCircle,0,1.0,False
1lfi121,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/1lfi121/any_turkish_people_in_here_i_have_a_question/,Any Turkish people in here? I have a question.,"Hello everyone. So I live in the US, but was at a Turkish jewelry store. When I went in, the guy there started sparking up a conversation. He was really sweet and helped me try on some necklaces. I ended up getting two. 

After I paid, when I was leaving, he invited me into the back for coffee and treats. I said sure (I figured it would be seen as disrespectful if I said no) and we drank coffee and ate some snacks. When I got up to leave, he asked me for my name and said he liked my name. Then he grabbed my hand and kissed it and called me beautiful. 

After that he invited me over for more coffee and desserts tomorrow afternoon. 

My question is, is this culturally how people from Turkey are when meeting new people? Or is he flirting? 

I am unfamiliar with Turkish culture and I just don’t want to think the wrong thing. 

I hope that I am not being culturally insensitive. I just am unfamiliar. ",0,1750357260.0,immigration,20,0.5,False
