I wonder if anyone has any advice based on their experiences regarding side effects ….

I’ve opted for IR meds purely because I haven’t a cat in hells chance of getting a SCA (Oxfordshire) and they’re more affordable. I was originally started on methylphenidate 5mg then 10mg x2 a day but whilst I loved the calming effects I actually felt so fogged and almost sedated I’m now trying Amfexa. 

I took my first dose today 5mg at around midday. I felt more focused and clear headed which is what I have been hoping for from meds. However I had a slight racing heart but also a little dizziness that pretty much has stayed (it’s now 8pm!). Has anyone else experienced something similar to find that their side effects settled down with continued use? 

I made sure I ate before taking the tablet although I’m not sure I was properly hydrated, I drank tea, coffee and Diet Coke… maybe not a wise choice with these meds?? ",1,1733947686.0,ADHDUK,1,1.0,False
1hc2p18,https://www.reddit.com/r/UrinatingTree/comments/1hc2p18/haters_guide_to_bowl_season_20242025_aka_the/,Haters Guide to Bowl Season 2024-2025 (aka the College Football 2024 Debriefing),"Welcome to the first bowl season that coincides with the expanded playoffs. Its pretty ironic that four teams are going to not necessarily play in a bowl game this year. Shouldn’t there be consolation games for that? Anyway, with this further segregation of all six New Year’s bowl games being integrated in the playoffs, this post is basically this year’s debriefing for any Power 4 team that went over .500 this year.

Frisco Bowl (Memphis vs West Virginia)

Another solid year for Ryan Silverfield’s Memphis. They have earned their second 10-win season. They still are a little way’s to go to win the AAC and, hopefully, a chance for the CFP, but Memphis should be excited. On the other hand, the definition of Mid, West Virginia, had fired their head coach, Neal Brown, after a 6-6 season. I think we all know who’s gonna get to the coffee first.

LA Bowl (Cal vs UNLV)

Cal is back to bear territory of 6-6. They wasted a College Gameday, let me remind you. At least they’re better off than UNLV. Oh boy, UNLV. It is one thing to lose to Boise State a second time to be eliminated from the playoffs. It is another thing to lose your head coach, Barry Odom, to Purdue. That is on top of losing Sluka earlier this year for petty bullshit. Are you still regretting sitting out of the exodus to the Pac-7? I still think UNLV has the talent to win this game, but the players have to be distraught, right?

Cure Bowl (Ohio vs Jax State)

This is cool. Two conference champions from the Group of 5 playing each other. And BOTH head coaches are gonna go to different schools next year. Wait, Rich Rodriguez was the Jax State head coach? And he accepted his West Virginia job back?! Ching ching!

Gasparilla Bowl (Tulane vs Florida)

We have an SEC reunion. Tulane had been impressive in their first year under Jon Sumrall. They fell short of their CFP ambitions with losses to Memphis and Army. Their start QB, Darien Mensah, is also transferring. On the flip side, Florida, as rough as their first half was, was liberated thanks in part to Graham Mertz’s injury. This opened up the floodgates for DJ Lagway. Two major upsets back-to-back would keep Billy Napier off the hot seat. Florida has all the momentum, so I’m picking them to win in Tampa.

GameAbove Sports Bowl (Pitt vs Toledo)

This is the worst bowl name. Hands down. At least QuickLane was appropriate with it being in Detroit and Ford being a sponsor. This is soulless. Kind of like Pitt’s 2^(nd) half. Toledo’s season, too. Seriously, how in God’s name did Toledo lose to Akron.

(Guaranteed) Rate Bowl (Rutgers vs Kansas State)

This was supposed to be 2006 2.0 for Rutgers. Instead, it was a season marred by injuries. Kyle Monangai had yet another stellar season, and he should do well in the upcoming draft. Kansas State had spent most of the year ranked. But it was a very weak November that killed them. Kansas State was Rutgers’ first ever win against a bowl opponent back in that 2006 season. Sadly, I think those injuries will be too much for Rutgers to win this time.

Armed Forces Bowl (Oklahoma vs Navy)

The Jackson Arnold era has ended as quickly as it started. He’s going to Miss State. Venables should just shake it off. They have a Navy team on deck that has no passing. They’ll be fine.

Liberty Bowl (Texas Tech vs Arkansas)

This is a Southwest rivalry renewed. Arkansas is back in bowl season, but they got destroyed by every ranked team (besides Tennessee). And Bobby Petrino’s offensive genius has not shown up at all. Texas Tech will cap off a disappointing centennial season with this game. They had an impressive offense with Tahj Brooks in the backfield. I will go with Texas Tech on this.

Birmingham Bowl (Georgia Tech vs Vanderbilt)

This was a hot SEC rivalry back in the day. 200 miles separate Nashville and Atlanta. They will play at an equidistant battlefield in Birmingham. This will likely be Diego Pavia’s last game as a Commodore due to eligibility bullshit. It might be Haynes King’s last, also, as he might go to the transfer portal. Regardless, these two teams are alike in many ways. But this year, they are alike with being the spoilers of their respective conferences. For the memes, I'm taking Vanderbilt. This is the last gleaming for Clark Lea before the magic disappears.

Holiday Bowl (Syracuse vs Wazzu)

Excellent work from Fran Brown in his first year as Syracuse coach. For Kyle McCord’s sake, it was a downgrade, but he’s still got it. Wazzu is the lone Pac-2 representative this year in the bowl games. They lost their last three games. Remember there was wishful thinking Wazzu could make an at-large bid. Those were the days. Im picking Syracuse big with this one.

Las Vegas Bowl (Texas A&M vs USC)

Congratulations, Lincoln. You officially wasted whatever career Miller Moss had early in the season. You get the dubious reward of facing the 12^(th) Man Family Circus. Im picking A&M, but USC might keep it close with their defense.

Fenway Bowl (UConn vs UNC)

Ain’t no way this is coincidental. We have a Fenway Bowl featuring a regional team (UXonn) and the UNC team that is about to get the NFL GOAT Bill Belichick to be their head coach. Yes, he still has his VERY young girlfriend. I bet that he would recruit more sorority powderpuffs than actual players. Anyway, UNC will win. But I’m keeping an eye out. I wouldn’t be surprised if Bill would gets a front row to this.

Pinstripe Bowl (Nebraska vs Boston College)

I guess people are right about Dylan Raiola. He is so full of himself that he is Patrick Mahomes, he went to Arrowhead to sign autographs. Boston College, meanwhile, have to mourn Thomas Castellanos entering the portal. Who knew that the Eagles weren’t good in the first place? Im taking the Huskers.

New Mexico Bowl (Louisiana-Lafayette vs TCU)

The Cajuns proved to us they had the better end of the stick than Napier… for now. TCU had a bounce-back year despite one of the easiest schedules in the league. The magic of 2022 is evermore fleeting every week. I think it will be TCU in a close one.

Pop Tarts Bowl (Iowa State vs Miami)

Yet another promising season for Miami, only to choke in the worst possible way. Their loss to Syracuse I fully expected. They blew their chance on going to the ACC Championship and had lost the wavering support of the committee. They are 2^(nd) team out. Iowa State was out in a different way… and it was humiliation from Arizona State. They, too, were ranked in the Top 10 and in a position to go all in. Only to crumble in November. For this matchup, Iowa State could make it a close game with Cam Ward declaring for the draft and Rocco Becht staying for next season.

Military Bowl (East Carolina v NC State)

Another regional rivalry game renewed. Two teams from Eastern Carolina on the battlefield… in Annapolis, Maryland. This will be the first time this rivalry will be played outside of North Carolina since 1992 when East Carolina won the goddamn Peach Bowl. Yeah, ECU did that. Im taking NC State on a toss-up.

Alamo Bowl (BYU vs Colorado)

I know what you’re thinking. Why the fuck are two Big 12 teams in a bowl game together? Well, there was a stipulation. The Pac-12 schools that left will keep their bowl agreements for the next few years. Colorado is a former Big 12 team. This is basically the third-place game for the Big 12. These two teams had no expectations of doing anything and both were this close to achieving it in part to tiebreakers in the Big 12. Colorado will be expected to shed talent because of opting to go to the draft. BYU will make it really close.

Independence Bowl (Marshall vs Army)

Another matchup between conference winners. Marshall came from nowhere and won seven straight to win the Sun Belt. Army did everything but beat Notre Dame. They still have the Army-Navy game coming up, but I think Army has what it takes to take the Herd down. Go Army!

Music City Bowl (Mizzou vs Iowa)

The most hated rivalry that is never played. Why? It is an old but ugly tale involving Frank “Kinney” Holbrook, the first African-American to play at Iowa. It was 1896 and Missouri players urged Iowa not to play him while they were at Columbia. They did it anyway, and he got abused and heckled thoughout the game. When another racial incident was averted in 1902, Iowa vowed to never play Missouri again… for about 100 years. Even after all of the racial connotations removed, Missouri is still ducking them. They canceled their bowl game against Iowa back in 2020 because of COVID. No more hiding this time.

Reliaquest Bowl (Alabama vs Michigan)

\*still laughing\* I still cant believe they didn’t get it. \*sighing\* Too bad we can’t prevent Alabama from getting another 10-win season. It’s a revenge game against a Michigan team that doesn’t have a QB (yet). This is because Bama players are leaving en masse to the transfer portal and the draft. Bama are still heavy favorites. But as we saw with “The Game”, don’t expect anything from Big Blue. In the best possible way, I meant.

Sun Bowl (Louisville vs Washington)

Washington was this year’s TCU with a head coaching change added on. Louisville had yet another year of meddling in the ACC. I’m picking the more veteran-coached Louisville on this.

Citrus Bowl (South Carolina vs Illinois)

It was Beamer Ball’s grand return… until the committee anchored down the Gamecocks due to head-to-head losses from Bama and Ole Miss early in the season. Despite their win over Clemson, it did nothing to bump them up over. LaNorris Sellers, Nyck Harbor, and that talented defense will instead eat the carcass of Bret Bielema’s Illini.

Texas Bowl (Baylor vs LSU)

Baylor had been under the radar the whole season. They lost 4 of their first 6, most of them from good Big 12 teams, and yet they won their last 6. Dave Aranda might’ve saved his job for a season at least. LSU is in a downward spiral. Bryce Underwood lost faith in the program. Brian Kelly is on its last legs in Baton Rouge. Expect Baylor to pull off the upset.

Gator Bowl (Duke vs Ole Miss)

Ole Miss wasted this season. If it wasn’t for their losses to Kentucky or Florida, they would be easy locks in the playoffs. Instead, they will face Manny Diaz’s Duke in Jacksonville. Great first season for him and with Maalik Murphy as QB. But Ole Miss doesn’t give a shit. And Maalik is transferring. Im going big on the Rebels. At least that Tulane QB is gonna come next year for Duke.

Duke’s Mayo Bowl (Minnesota vs V-Tech)

Alright. The Mayo Bowl is last on the list. V-Tech had a lot of hype this year. That went away as soon as they lost to the once-lowly Vanderbilt. Minnesota had a bounce-back year, but they should’ve done more. They lost a few very close games including to Michigan, UNC, and almost upsetting Penn State. This will be another close game, but Virginia Tech will have the crowd advantage, so I’m giving the nod to them.",1,1733947661.0,UrinatingTree,0,1.0,False

1hc2lnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1hc2lnk/caffeine_withdrawal_guide_from_a_psychologist/,Caffeine Withdrawal Guide (From a Psychologist),"So for context,

I am a 23 y/o male

My body is **VERY** sensitive to caffeine (I am not a chronic caffeine user nor have I ever been). So much so that one cup of coffee would basically full stop cure my ADHD and almost completely suppress my appetite. The trade off was always high levels of anxiety. Early November I accidentally drank about 12-8 oz of cold brew concentrate instead of coffee and got one of the worst panic attacks of my life that day. Ever since, I've been to the hospital twice where doctors ran tests and found nothing wrong. I used to have anxiety problems but they're in remission because I know how to take care of my mental health (I'm an MA Clinical Psychologist student). Prior to this I had no health problems. My diet was generally pretty solid and I was very good about trying to keep up with my mental health.

The first 14 days were brutal. I am currently on day 25 of withdrawal. I've always been a problem solver, so I decided to note some observations I've experienced as well as some basic science that might serve to help you guys understand why withdrawal can be so hard or not so hard depending on who you are. It basically stems from your sensitivity to Caffeine as well as your general tolerance. Speaking broadly, any negative symptoms you usually have while drinking Caffeine will be heightened during withdrawal.

**Symptoms I've experienced** 

\- Anxiety   
\- Heart Palpitations  
\- Feeling like I had a fever   
\- Tremors   
\- Headaches   
\- Super sensitive to bright lights / sounds   
\- Nausea every morning   
\- Feeling faint / lightheaded   
\- Insomnia / sleep disturbances   
\- Mood swings / loss of motivation   
\- Light hallucinations (like seeing floaties at nights) / lucid thoughts   
\- Bloating / Digestive issues   
\- Face going numb / random aches 

*As an MA Psychologist, I can tell you that I basically met the entire criteria in the DSM (book used for certain mental/neural diagnosis) for Caffeine Withdrawal.* 

**Symptoms Now**

Almost everything has improved and some of the symptoms have basically disappeared. That being said, the main lingering ones for me have been anxiety, palpitations, and light headedness. I wanted to make this post to not only share my experience but explain the science as to why the symptoms tend to vary so much in extremity / duration for some people. Honestly, I'd love to hear the opinions of people who have recovered from withdrawal or are in the middle of it. 

**Basic Science**

Biologically, I'm sure you're all well aware that our bodies are different. If you drink and use caffeine often, your body adapts and you grow tolerance. This tolerance means that for some folks, they tend to be less sensitive to certain aspects of caffeine,

How does caffeine work? It's an Adenosine antagonist. Adenosine is a neurotransmitter that's usually known for regulating sleep drive / wakefulness. When you drink caffeine, you suppress it temporarily, which is why people tend to crash later in the day since the Adenosine swarms back to its receptor. Here's the problem with caffeine withdrawal. Chronic use of caffeine or high doses forces your brain to upregulate the ***amount*** of Adenosine receptors. This causes problems when you quit cold turkey, as your brain becomes ***VERY*** sensitive to Adenosine. 

What does this cause? Neurotransmitters tend to be oversimplified on social media. For example, while it's true Serotonin helps regulate mood, it plays key roles in sleep and digestion as well. Adenosine is like this too. Adenosine helps to modulate and control the **Autonomic Nervous System**. To simplify it, if you have problems with Adenosine, you're most likely going to have problems with your ANS (abbreviated). This means problems with blood flow, heart beat, control of your **Sympathetic vs. Parasympathetic Nervous System** (Fight or Flight takes control and becomes hyper sensitive, Rest and Digest system is subdued). Adenosine also plays roles in **Gut Motility**, which is why people also often have diarrhea and bloating issues. 

As some people also know, Caffeine also plays with other neurotransmitters such as GABA, Dopamine, Glutamate (an excitatory neurotransmitter) and Norepinephrine (adrenaline). This is where problems with mood regulation / motivation tend to stem from. GABA acts as a pretty important inhibitory neurotransmitter as well, which is why for some it feels like your body can't hit the breaks and you just keep spiraling into panic. It's also important to note Caffeine plays a key role in your **HPA axis**, which is what regulates your Cortisol (the stress hormone, but again it does more than this). Cortisol plays a big role in your **Circadian Rhythm**, it's supposed to spike in the morning and decrease at night. Problems with it make sleep / anxiety worse.



**Guide**

If you want to speed up your recovery through withdrawal you **HAVE** to trust the process. Downregulating and getting rid of all your extra Adenosine receptors as well as returning to a normal brain chemical / synaptic balance takes time. Your brain **CAN** and **DOES** change, it just needs time to do so. Everyone also has different bodies, so factors such as how long you've been using coffee, how sensitive you are to it, and the doses you take are also relevant. That being said, what are things you can do to speed up recovery?

\- Exercise  
\- Eat well (some foods tend to be particularly beneficial for the brain, so in this case anything high in electrolytes / omega 3s which tends to include a lot of seeds / nuts / fruits)  
\- Journal to remind yourself of progress  
\- Meditate or do Deep breathing (myriad of mental benefits / helps recover brain health)   
\- Try to cut down stressors **if possible** (brain is hypersensitive to them at this time)  
\- **If possible** do your best to sleep at night, it's the most critical period of brain recovery  
\- See a therapist or make sure you have some sort of social support system

\- Cold exposure / showers as a form of Eustress to increase resilience and help brain health, but don't push yourself   
\- To be safe make sure you see a doctor at least once to rule out any other causes (if possible)    
  
Ultimately, good health habits are your best friend here. I could go on and on but the fact of the matter is we have to buckle down and just do the best we cans. I do not realistically expect people to do everything right, because neither have I. That being said, we're trying to fix our brains, and that unfortunately takes time. Younger people tend to have higher levels of neural plasticity as well, so your age can sometimes play a factor.                                  



**Supplements** 

BECAREFUL WITH THIS AND DO YOUR RESEARCH! ALL BODIES ARE DIFFERENT! This is **NOT** medical advice. Simply, through my research, these tend to help facilitate recovery. 

Ashwagandha (lowers cortisol levels and helps to improve anxiety) 

L Theanine (helps to unwind / relax, lowers anxiety) 

Magnesium Glycinate (helps to relax your nervous system, particularly effective before bed) 

Melatonin (use no more than 3 mg usually, it helps a lot with sleep but too much can cause mood problems for some people, otherwise this one tends to be pretty safe and effective)

Ginger Tea (helps with nausea / light headedness) 

Chamomile Tea (helps to reduce anxiety and helps increase sleep) 

B Vitamins (helps brain health / brain recovery / mood regulation, do **NOT** take this on an empty stomach, it'll make some people nauseous) 

Omega 3s (ideally just eat foods that have this, there's mixed evidence around the types of Omega 3s found in supplements, walnuts, fish, chia seeds are some examples) 



**Closing Thoughts**

**AGAIN**, do your research, experiment, and see what seems to help you. Needless to say this has been one of the worst experiences of my life. Losing control of your body and having to bunker down is not fun, but this can be an area of significant growth for us. It can teach us resilience, patience, and it can help to foster good habits. I have been struggling truth be told, but things **HAVE** been getting better. I am fairly lucky in that I am still young and that I wasn't a Caffeine user before this. That being said, I have still been going through pretty acute withdrawal so I understand everyone's frustrations. ",1,1733947422.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

Thanks for your suggestions about my symbol problem. I contacted the Etsy seller and she sent me a new version with easy to distinguish symbols in a matter of minutes! The pattern hasn't gotten any less complex, but at least now I don't have to keep frogging the places where I used solid star when I should have used outline star, or lost track of whether that color was outline-arrow-pointing-down or solid-arrow-pointing-down. I gave the seller an excellent review. Now my only regret is that I didn't do it sooner. Not that it would have been the difference between finishing before Christmas and not; I'm pretty sure that ship sailed before I even started.

1hc2l50,https://www.reddit.com/r/physicalredteam/comments/1hc2l50/quick_wins_and_low_hanging_fruit/,Quick Wins and Low Hanging Fruit,"*How security teams can start testing and improving security today*

Physical red teaming, stress testing, or penetration testing all feel like a major undertaking for a security program, and for full scale in-depth testing this is true. Yet most organizations will see a major benefit and perform better during those full-scale exercises if they start with simple, easy, low-level tests. During a recent presentation at GSX, we received many questions and follow-up about this slide, so we wanted to expand on it.

# Why Test?

Many security professionals will test to test, which serves little purpose and provides even less useful guidance when making testing decisions. First, you must establish why you are running these exercises. Choose one or more answers below:

Locks and Leaks is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.

* **Data Gathering**: You can’t manage what you don’t measure.
* **Vendor Assurance**: Test and hold vendors accountable.
* **Uncover Vulnerabilities**: Identify opportunities to improve the current security program.
* **Improve Vigilance**: Security officers who know they will be tested regularly are more likely to stay on their toes and **identify** suspicious behavior.
* **Gamify Security**: Moving from an arduous job to an engaging cat-and-mouse game is a great way to keep people engaged, competitive, and effective.
* **Improved Reporting**: Security officers are more likely to **report** suspicious or unusual activity if they think they are being tested.

# 1. Tailgating

Tailgating is an easy test to perform frequently. Security managers can try to tailgate themselves if they’re not recognized by security officers or they can use employees or role-players to tailgate at different locations. Adding a second role-player to ask questions while another attempts to tailgate can provide additional insights. Conducting these tests at various times, locations, and lobby setups helps gather comprehensive data on what works and what doesn’t.

# 2. Impersonation

Claim that your wallet was stolen while at the gym and you need a temporary badge issued to get to your desk and retrieve your belongings. Start on LinkedIn and find a company employee who looks like you. Then, claim to be them and see if security will provide you with a temporary badge. You may act a little stressed or hurried about an upcoming meeting to increase the pressure. Try variations on this effort to see security’s response and whether clear Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) exist to defend against employee impersonation.

# 3. USB Plug-Ins

Your goal is to get security to plug a USB into their computer. First, ensure the USB is clean and free from malware - you are actively trying to reduce risk, not increase it. Use a new, wiped company-issued USB. For added legitimacy, consider etching the company’s name or logo on the USB. Alternatively, you can add a label, a sticker, or leave it blank. You might claim you're there for an interview and that your resume got ruined (bonus points if you have a resume with coffee stains on it!), asking them to print another copy for you. This test is crucial as it's a common method for introducing malware into a system.

# 4. Hostile Surveillance

This one is most relevant to Executive Protection (EP) and advanced security teams.

* Dynamic EP Teams: Can you monitor their patrol or track the principal's movements over an extended period without the EP team noticing?
* Static EP Teams: How long and close can you conduct surveillance on an EP post without them noticing?
* Security Teams: Can you follow a security patrol or conduct prolonged surveillance of a sensitive site without being detected?

There are many versions of this. The key is that any bad actor is going to conduct extensive surveillance before carrying out an attack, whether it’s to cause harm or plant surveillance devices. The goal is to determine with these advanced security teams can detect pre-operational surveillance and practice what their response will be to this scenario.

**Hot tip**: do not attempt this exercise without partnering with the relevant teams first. Your goal is a friendly scrimmage, not a confrontation (because the protective detail does not know who you are) or escalation relating to the C-suite members.

# Adversarial OSINT

Companies often have analysts skilled in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering and analysis. Direct their focus inward, to your own organization, by giving them scenarios like: “You are a well-funded, unethical competitor seeking to compromise XYZ line of business. Gather OSINT to identify weaknesses and attack strategies.” They should then explore social media, advanced search techniques, and other methods to find security gaps. Regular exercises to identify vulnerabilities are essential for company safety.

# 6. Testing Policy

Create a policy requiring real-world testing of new security controls before they go live. For instance, AI video analysis software promising to detect 90% of suspicious packages should be tested while the vendor is on-site. Similarly, new turnstiles with anti-tailgating technology should undergo repeated tests to ensure accurate detection. Establishing a policy that mandates real-world testing to meet target goals (e.g., 90% package detection, 99% tailgating detection) before implementation is essential. We have experience helping companies write such policies. The goal is to hold vendors accountable, confirm proper configuration, and ensure the technology works as expected in real-world conditions. A simple one-page policy can foster a culture of accountability, ensuring effective, tested, and validated security controls.

Searched around but couldn't find the info I was looking for. 

Received my Aiden today, very much looking forward but my first brew was a swing and a miss... 

Bit of context: I was using a Mocca Master Cup One before and got that one dialed in pretty ok with my Timemore 064s grinder. However, using the same grind size (9) on the same coffee (light-medium roast Guatemalan)  using the medium roast profile, resulted in a, well... disgusting cup, reminded me of those coffees my parents used to drink and which kept me from trying coffee for a long time. More objectively, I guess the tasting notes were bitter, burnt but also astringent. The coffee bed was also dipped by the way. 

Anywho, long story short, I guess I should experiment with other profiles (probably lowering the temp), but I also found it hard to find a good reference on grind sizes. Yes, Fellow has made suggestions when using their own grinders, but I'm not (and expect there to be more people like that). 

Is there anyone who successfully dialed in their Aiden using a 064s that can give advice? Or, is there some sort of conversion chart available that compares grind sizes on different grinders? Or... well, any advice is 🤗",1,1733947330.0,FellowProducts,1,1.0,False

My (35F) boyfriend (36M) of 5 months (but friends for a while before) is going through a bout of seasonal despression, and is at risk of losing his job. He's really going through it right now. I've noticed when he's like this, he closes off and our texts are pretty minimal, more like check ins, and he also wants to hangout less. He doesn't really open about how he is feeling dispite me asking and trying to create a warm, welcoming environment for him to do so. I have a back ground in psych and social work so being a good listener is kinda my jam.

Normally he is very affectionate, both physically and verbally. He will text me in the middle of the day being like ""hey. I love you"", or ""did you drink enough water"". When we see each other he is very hand holdy, cuddling, doesn't mind getting me water or feeding my cat. Just very kind and attentive. All around great boyfriend.

I myself, I consider myself to be thoughtful. Since he spends more time at my place, I keep it stocked with his fav coffees, snacks, teas, etc. I try to delint my house because he is allergic to my cat. Send coffee giftcards when he's having a bad day. To sum, I think we are very nice to each other. 

Where he seems to suffer with depression, I suffer with anxiety. I have a lot of issues to work though as I am finishing a divorce where I was cheated on, manipulated, gaslight the whole 9 yards. I come with a lot of issues that I am in therapy for. He is very supportive and kind to me during my anxious episodes. This is really the first time I'm seeing depression affect him. 

The other day I text him mid day saying ""love you"" and he didn't respond. instead he sent me memes via Ig (which is normal for us). hours go by and I'm like hey if you'd like me to be less affectionate that's fine, but not saying it back at all hurts. and hes like I say it to you every day (we say it every night) and do lots of nice things for you. Isn't that enough? You know I'm struggling. You shouldn't say it if expecting a response if that's how you feel.

I call him and say no I did say it for you, to cheer you up I know you're going through a hard time. I just noticed the absence of you not saying it back, like you normally do. I notice patterns. He's getting annoyed with me and says well this is kinda one more thing and I'm already struggling, it should be obvious how i'm feeling. We change the subject, talk about other stuff. I'm having terrible anxiety attacks and go to bed. 

He asks how i'm going todayand he says we can talk via text over his lunch break. I opt to call which he asks just for texting.  I told him i'm stressed over the state of our relationship and want to be in a relationship where if one person says I love you, you can expect to hear it back. and he says he is strung thin, and doesn't want to be guilted into saying something when he is already dealing with his own stresses and depression. I try telling him this is what I need in a relationship, after the types of relationships I've had. I sent a voice clip of him from a few months ago where he says how much he loves me and my smile, and is so lucky to have me etc. and he says he needs someone who is able to discern by his actions and showing that I lvoe them back and workds aren't the end all be all. and that he lives with depression and this is the result.

There's more but it's really just going in circles so I'll end there. I'm tore because coming out of a divorce I was cheated on and experienced emotional abuse, saying I love you seems so simple. But I also recognize the struggles he is going through - but I don't want to live a small life and not have my needs met. Help!",1,1733947246.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

Messengers of Heaven

The unusual pattern of the leaves of these plants, somewhat resembling the pattern of epistions and phytonia, puts them in a special position among other variegated plants. Like jewels that fell from the sky, they are scattered all over the earth from Asia to South America.

The geography of the so-called precious orchids is extremely wide: China, India, Japan (cold-resistant forms), Brazil (leafy forms), Vietnam. They are also common in island territories - in Indonesia, New Zealand, New Guinea. Simple forms also grow here (the Goodyera repens orchid is found even in the Moscow region).

The areas of these plants have their own mysteries. Thus, after the Vietnam War, the Roxburg anectochylus (Anoectochilus roxburghii) disappeared, and only recently the missing species was found again. In Japan, some decorative species of ""brocade"" orchids (that's what they are called in the Land of the Rising Sun) disappeared for centuries, but then they were rediscovered in nature and renewed in culture. Cheirostyles, or ""gray mouse"", was found in the mountainous regions of Ceylon, but later disappeared and was not found in habitats.

This property makes collections of precious orchids unique and unique. The merit of domestic enthusiasts is that in Russia specially decorative varieties have been introduced to our country twenty years ago and no longer exist in nature have been preserved.

When you look at these plants, it seems that the ornament of their leaves tells something, as if asking to be solved. The vein of the orchid leaf Makodes (Macodes) resembles the Javanese alphabet. And the leaf pattern of representatives of the genus anectochylus is sometimes very resemble to the lines of the Arabic easm, praising the greatness of God in all its manifestations.

In what language of the future or, perhaps, of the past are these manuscripts, these messages of heaven written? The drawing of the leaves of precious orchids is fascinating, you can admire the plants for hours. They are even able to cure diseases.

Having become interested in these plants twenty years ago, I noticed that the customer demand for them is very low. They were acquired mainly by extraordinary, ""marked from above"", people. In fact, not everyone manages to grow them. Many people, having bought an unpretentious plant at first glance (well, what is not a tradescantia?), could not grow it and, desperate, threw it in the trash can. And only selected singles carefully watched the exquisite plants, trying to understand their sophisticated essence, to understand the complex nature of these orchids. Once ""sick"" with them, they were ready to go anywhere, even to the end of the world, to replenish their collections.

Precious orchids are mysterious plants in everything, starting with the fact that they literally transform if they are well cared for. In nature, it is sometimes difficult to notice them among the fallen leaves: they are stained with unwashable dirt, eaten by pests, and the wonderful pattern is almost invisible. After years of painstaking cultivation, the plants are transformed, just as a precious stone begins to sparkle with facets in the hands of a jeweler. With each appearing leaf, a new, more complex, noble pattern opens.

The unusualness of these plants lies in the fact that it is difficult for them to find optimal conditions for keeping. In nature, for example in Vietnam, they can withstand quite high temperatures. And in the conditions of indoor culture, they can hardly tolerate 26-27°C and die from fungal diseases. Perhaps, in natural conditions, they live in symbiosis with mycorysal fungi, which allows them to exist normally in the dark under the forest canopy, among fallen leaves and moss. It is not clear why precious orchids are so susceptible to rot caused by phytopathogenic fungi, because the strongest fungicides are isolated from these plants.

The most famous representatives of precious orchids are Hemaria, Makodes, Dossinia, Anectochylus, Goodyera, Zeuxine. Systematists refer them to the subtribe of Erythrodaceae of the Orchid family.

In the USSR, the main flow of imported species came from Vietnam. Due to the current political situation in the world, these plants practically did not reach European countries, and even more so to the United States. But even in those rare cases when orchids got to Europe, due to the difficulty in culture, they did not last there for long, in connection with which their systematics turned out to be underdeveloped. Determining the exact systematic position of a particular species was complicated by the abundance of hybrids (in nature, these orchids freely cross with each other, giving plants with leaves of a wide variety of patterns and colors in the offspring). In addition, plants were often studied by herbarium samples, which in appearance were very far from natural analogues.

The names of the brought orchids (if they existed at all) were confused with each other or simply lost. The need forced to come up with conditional names, to give ""commercial"" names. For example, one of the hybrids of Roxburg's annex, still grown by amateurs, is a well-known collector V.A. Mikheev gave the name 'Sailight'. It was almost impossible to identify plants before the species due to the huge number of varieties, and amateurs had to distinguish plants by photos.

The history of precious orchids in Russia began in the times of E.L. Regel, director of the St. Petersburg Botanical Garden from 1855 to 1892, who mentioned them in his books.

In the USSR, the development of the culture of these plants is inextricably linked with the name of Nikolai Alexandrovich Bersenev. Thanks to him, precious orchids have gained popularity among connoisseurs of rarities, he developed the basics of their agricultural technology in amateur conditions, collected a unique collection, awarded with world awards. It is through his works that precious orchids have survived in Russia to this day. The plants grown by him, which reached 30-50 cm in height and were distinguished by an expressive leaf pattern, looked much more spectacular than natural specimens.

Several times a year N.A. Bersenev went to remote places of the Moscow region, collecting special uncontaminated moss-s sphagnum. He planted plants in glass boxes, on the bottom of which he poured pieces of foam, above - a multi-component earth mixture (pine needles, alder soil, charcoal, etc.). Thanks to the continuous wick rise of water, live moss growing from above created high humidity in greenhouses, forming a special microclimate. Containers with plants were located on the floor, which protected them from overheating in the hot summer months. With 12-hour lighting, the plants developed rapidly, were compact, with a thick stem, dense leaves and never got sick. Among the flower growers of N.A. Bersenev there is no and there was no equal quality of grown orchids.

There is very little literature covering the content of precious orchids at home, in addition, it is not enough for novice lovers of information. Foreign publications practically ignore these plants (except for hemarium). Meanwhile, their secret lies precisely in the secrets of their cultivation. In nature, different species of orchids are timed to different ecological conditions - tropical forests, swampy places, slopes of ravines or mountains, some grow in dense shade, others - in open places under direct sunlight. The same in room conditions: plants, often outwardly similar to each other, require different lighting, humidity, temperature. So, hemaria in wet hot greenhouses feel worse than on the windowsills. Goodyear grows in low light, but prefers low temperatures. Soil, mosses, mycoris-forming fungi in places where various orchids grow are also specific. It is likely that this explains the fact that orchid seeds germinate easily in nature, and seedlings can be obtained in culture only in laboratory conditions.

There is no doubt that precious orchids can be successfully grown only in living sphagnum. N.A. Bersenev immersed the moss in hot water (42°), thus getting rid of snails. However, over the summer, the moss grew out and a complex and tedious procedure to replace it had to be carried out. But thanks to the use of live moss, the main thing was achieved: the substrate did not have too acidic reaction and did not contain pathogenic fungi of the genera Fusarium and Botrytis. Beech leaves were also added to the soil.

Of course, the pride of the N.A. collection Bersenev were hybrid anectochi-luses (A. regalisii x A. goh-burghii). There were no more than twenty such amazingly beautiful plants with leaves covered with a thick golden-white net of different shades. The green leaves of the makodes orchid, sparkling with veins, as well as the pale green leaves of light varieties of anectochilius also looked very impressive. Among the latter, an orchid with a bright pure white stripe in the center of a green leaf, which N.A. Bersenev called a ""spider"", was distinguished by special sophistication. Silver leaves of heirostiles and dark coffee dossinia looked great. Gemarias have diversified the collection of velvet foliage with a unique pattern. Unfortunately, not all beautiful varieties have been preserved to this day or at least captured in photos.

Talking about precious orchids, it is necessary to mention the ""super jewels"", which I.V. talks about in his book. Belitsky (""Orchids"", Moscow, ACT, Astrel, 2001). In fact, we are talking about Japanese species. They are significantly inferior in beauty to the Vietnamese orchids. Their leaf pattern is of the same type and is an inexprensive grid of veins and white stripes arranged as if in patches along the leaf. In appearance, these orchids are more like variegated peperomia and are distinguished by their chololy. Some of them do not withstand temperatures above 12-15° and do not live long in normal home conditions. Therefore, the Japanese again and again go to the natural habitats of orchids to find a replacement for the dead specimens. Rare species are put up for auction, where their yen reaches 1000 US dollars.

Despite the fact that seed reproduction of precious orchids is not an easy matter, obtaining seedlings and further work on hybridization is very promising. The leaves of the anectomy (anectochilus x hemaria) bred by V.A. Mikheev have a very beautiful pearly pink tint. The most decorative varieties of Roxburg's anecto-hilus were selected by N.A. Bersenev. Today in the United States there is a company engaged in the selection and breeding of hybrid orchids anectomy, macomarium (macodes x hemaria) and dossinemari (dossinia x hemaria). Thanks to new modern methods of selection, in the future it may be possible to obtain extraordinary varieties and varieties.

Growing precious orchids is an extremely exciting activity. The mass distribution of these plants among amateur vet breeders is prevented by the need to maintain high air humidity during their cultivation. Although many enthusiasts quite successfully cope with difficulties and keep their pets in normal apartment conditions. It seems quite likely that someday all the obstacles that stand in the way of those who would like to have a collection of precious orchids will be overcome, and everyone will be able to buy them at the nearest flower shop. But will these plants then retain their splendor, charm and uniqueness?",1,1733947243.0,Jewelorchids,1,1.0,False

I finally got myself the Bambino Plus on a cyberweek deal. Still learning how to calibrate and make something tolerable. So far it has been frustrating- the shot volumes are all over the place, the temperature of the milk has varied hugely (to the point of feeling it got burned!) and weirdly enough even the weight (18g) seems to be absolutely too much- If I force it in, I get under extraction from a puck - so have been gradually dropping it (now at 15g) but still feel it's not right. 🤨 Not able to justify having waited to buy this on sale... just yet! But am attributing it to user error/lack of experience with this...

My questions (with thanks in advance!)-

1. Is the double-walled basket the right place to start? I feel I can't fit the recommended 18g of coffee in there (grind's set to espresso #5 on a Shardor burr grinder)
2. I was testing the shot volume by running the double-walled basket in the default portafilter without any coffee. I seem to be getting anywhere between 1oz and 2oz for the single cup. That seems like a huge variance- is that even a fair test?
3. The steaming just doesn't seem consistent- I'm able to do better with manual steaming instead of the default press-a-button promise. Are there tips on how to do that better and more consistently?

There's some oddities with the way Sunday talks about/adresses the AE members. Like Trailblazer is Mr Caelus so is Welt, but Dan Heng is adressed without the Mr. Which in this case, it feels odd that Trailblazer is being called Mr, like, it doesn't fit.  
But what feels like an actual oversight from devs is Sunday referring to Himeko just as Himeko and not Miss Himeko. While March on the other hand is named Ms March by him. Like, he'd never just call Himeko without the Ms.   
It just feels very random and inconsistent (and to some extent even ooc) to me?

1hc2djt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Exercise/comments/1hc2djt/24_m_physically_active_but_not_amazing_shape/,"24 M (Physically active, but not amazing shape)","Hi, I'm not asking for anyone to do my research for me, rather I'm posting here because I'm afraid I'm missing a blind spot in my diet/exercise regime. Feel free to give a short response, I appreciate literally any advice or warning you can give.

So just some background: I'm a 24 y/o male, above average height, 24.4 BMI, if that matters. I have good testosterone levels for my age (700-800 ng/dL), so I know low testosterone isn't an issue. I've never had much of a sweet tooth, I don't like sweeteners, sugary drinks, or pretty much any rich or decadent dessert. This year I ran a half marathon 1:55:48 and climbed a mountain of about\~12,200ft. It may seem like I'm pretty healthy, but I have some concerns, and would like to improve. My health so far I would contribute to my overall pretty amazing genetics, and my family's high priority on bodily health, as well as a few lifestyle choices. Though I was never much of an athlete due to pretty bad coordination, I did wrestle in high school, when my BMI was between 19 and 21. I didn't exercise much in college, and gained about 40 pounds in two years, and have been at around the same weight, give or take 10 pounds since then. You could say that I've never had much muscle mass, even though I have a pretty broad frame. I was very lanky in HS, and became ""skinny-fat"" in college. Even in COVID when I was technically at an overweight BMI, no one ever thought so.

However recently I began treatment for ADHD, and I've had a better chance to look over my lifestyle habits and start making new ones. I have a strong desire to feel healthy and have natural energy from good food, exercise, and mindfulness. One thing I have done is take away saturated fats as much as I can from my diet. I was abusing fast food a lot this year, and I've switched to homemade meals (saves money and my health). I recently underwent a blood test where everything was well within healthy range, except for cholesterol (Total 202 mg/DL, and LDL 138 mg/DL). Another thing, is that I've really tried to prioritize vegetables as the staple of my food source, as well as counting macros (mostly trying to maintain protein counts, and limit sat fats and extra sugars). I am struggling to keep my protein up, so I'm trying to eat more eggs, clean meats like chicken and fish, and using protein supplements when feasible, like collagen in my coffee. So those are the lifestyle changes going into this. My goal is to make sustainable changes to my lifestyle that will have gradual impacts and be easy to maintain, because I've always struggled with keeping a plan, I've tended to go overboard too quickly and burn out.

I'm experimenting with a plan, but so far I want to keep the following routine and slowly add on:

1. Start each morning with 5 minutes of yoga and 5 minutes of dynamic stretching (following basic youtube videos until I find one I like)
2. Jog 1-2 miles around my hilly neighborhood at around 8-9 min pace. Really trying to not push myself too hard, my goal is that I can hit recovery in 24 hours so this is daily.
3. 10 minute calisthenics routine that I can do once or twice a day. Not anything crazy, just very basic things. Set a time limit so I don't overdo it. 

I have liked yoga, long distance running, and calisthenics in the past, so that is why I am adding it to a daily routine. Additionally, I've always struggled with coordination and core strength, so I am hoping that slow, controlled movements will help me ""learn my body"" so to speak. And finally, I think some daily effort on my heart is good, and helps me feel energized the rest of my day. In the future, I could incorporate resistance bands into these exercises if they begin to feel too easy.

It may seem like I'm going way too easy, but my problem has always been the mental effort of building a new routine, so it really has to start slow. Does anyone see anything I could add in 2-3 months? I know that this will not be a good way to build muscle mass, but I think I should focus on mobility, cardiovascular endurance, and mental discipline first, before picking up the free weights.

From that post, I've met some exceptional individuals, both male and female. Alas, nothing has stuck but the show must go on!

I'm 32, Indian male, 168cm, based in Virginia, Durban North. I don't want kids and I am not religious. I'm a writer, and work in community development with a bit of tour guiding as a side hustle. I'm financially comfortable looking to purchase a second investment property. 

I value my physical, mental and emotional health. I've been to therapy, put in the time, fixed my major childhood traumas, mostly. 

I'm a perfectionist but I am not perfect. I like birds. I like insects. I like nature. I'm curious. I ask why and how. I've been described as an optimistic nihilist. Epistemic justification and having a passion are important to me in a partner.

I'm a feminist. I'd choose the bear. Men haven't been raised right. Something is broken. 

I'm patient and understanding. And I'm funny, dammit I'm funny.

1hc29si,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1hc29si/is_my_bf_emotionally_abusive/,Is my bf emotionally abusive?,"Hey guys, I’m confused by my bf’s behavior throughout our relationship and about why I feel so guilty for wanting to leave him. He made me promise a few months ago that I wouldn’t break up with him (I told him I didn’t think I could promise that but he said in that case we might as well break up right then and there. I didn’t want that so I promised and I feel guilty that I want to leave him now. 

When we started dating it was amazing, magical, and perfect. This is another reason I’m struggling, because I truly thought I was going to marry him. But there were red flags. He got super angry over things that seemed insignificant and almost bizarre. For example, one time we were in a coffee shop and I stopped talking briefly to look up and read the menu, but he seemed to think I stopped talking with him because another guy got in line behind us, and he got really mad. 

Now, he accuses me of cheating almost every day. If I get home 5 minutes late because of traffic or because I didn’t get out quite on time, I was cheating. One time I went to the bathroom after getting home from work and he said I was probably cleaning myself down there because I just cheated on him. One time I changed my clothes after getting home from work, same thing. So now I don’t change my clothes and try to avoid going to the bathroom right away. One time he sniffed my underwear as if to see if he could smell another man. I have never cheated on him. 

Additionally, he gets mad at me if I don’t look away from the tv fast enough when a shirtless man pops up. He will accuse me of looking at other men in the grocery store when I’m just looking for an item. He gets mad if I let go of his arm in public. One time, I let go of his arm to go grab something at the store that was like 10 feet away, and came right back. There were no other people around us, but he was soooo angry. 

He has called me so many horrible names, he insults strangers and people on tv, he rants about things, he has road rage. When I bring up my concerns he always makes me feel bad somehow for hurting him in a similar way but never seems to address my original concern. He also has double standards and some of the things that I’ve done are okay for him to do because he’s a man, and apparently these things are okay for men, but not women. 

Oh, I’ve also discovered that he is both sexist and racist. He has said multiple times how much he hates women, he says racist things about black people. 

There’s way, way more, but I want to keep this post short-ish. Typing it all out, why the hell would I want to be with this guy? I don’t know. Deep down, I don’t want to anymore. But I’m sad because I was so in love with him at first. And I’m scared because I know he’s going to blame me and call me things and make me feel horrible. 

Idk guys. Should I try to work on things with him, or is my wanting to leave justified? Is this emotional abuse? Any thoughts are greatly appreciated as I am feeling really lost and confused right now. Thank you!!",1,1733946637.0,emotionalabuse,3,1.0,False

\### Training/Background

I did a modified Pfitz 18/70. I was coming off an injury that side-lined me at Grandma's marathon in June and a big move across the country. For Grandma's I was attempting the 18/70 for the first time. I was pretty confident I could handle the mileage, and think I \*would\* have, if I hadn't decided to also race a marathon in April, and then race a half-marathon the next weekend. Not sure what I was thinking???? Anyway, I didn't want to jump straight into the 18/70, so I merged the 18/55 and 18/70, increasing the mileage for the 18/55 plan over the first \~6 weeks or so until I was caught up to the 18/70 plan. 

It wasn't my most successful training cycle. I got a cold about 6 weeks out and took most of the week off. The election left me feeling very demoralized and I ended up not hitting my mileage goals that week, or doing any of the scheduled workouts. Most of the workouts went well. I felt like I was able to hit most of my targets and recover. One exception was the tune-up race scheduled around 4 weeks out, which I felt miserable for. 

\### Pre-race

I got up at 4:30 to eat and have some coffee. I got to the start around 6 or so and did a very slow mile warm-up, then I cycled through the porta-potty line several times until I'd emptied my bladder and bowels. 

Based on how difficult my MP runs felt, I new sub 3h was going to be ambitious/maybe not possible, but I wanted to go out intending to hit that target. I figured if I slowed down at the end, I would still PR. So I hopped into the coral and got as close to the 3h pace group as I could. 

\### Race

I felt super during the first half of the race. I was feeling confident, the pace felt medium-hard, but I didn't think I was going too fast. I thought I was holding back appropriately on the down-hills and running at a good constant effort on the up-hills. Over the course of the race I consumed \~2 servings of Tailwind in my water bottle (empty by mile 20) + 1 gel right before the race, 1 gel around 6 miles, and 1 gel around 16 miles. I ended up taking some of the electrolyte drink at aid station around mile 18, I think and then a little more around 22. 

Mile 18 is when things started to feel hard, and I started to worry. I made it up and over the bridge at mile 21.5 and could tell the last few miles were going to be tough. Around mile 22 I started to get really cold and around mile 23 I bonked. I just couldn't keep going. I felt a little nauseous too. So I walked a bit. Around mile 25 I got passed by the 3h05 pace group, and that was a bit demoralizing because I definitely thought I had <3h 05 in the bag. I managed to push through and finish with a \~2 minute PR. Getting the PR was nice, but I was disappointed I didn't do better.

\### Post-race

I had a really difficult time warming up post-race. I grabbed an emergency blanket from the medical tent, but even with that, my finisher's blanket, warm sweats, and standing/sitting in the sun I didn't feel warm for about 30 minutes after. I wish there was someway to know if my fitness just wasn't there for sub 3, or if I messed up my nutrition and didn't take enough. I suppose in reality it's probably a combination of the two.

1hc21wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalStatement/comments/1hc21wg/hello_this_is_my_initial_draft_for_a_personal/,"Hello! This is my initial draft for a personal statement for PA school, please tear it apart <3","She briskly walked to the next aid station, her bag weighed down by youth-sized winter boots. Another family arrived, gratefully taking three pairs along with socks and beanies to ward off the coming cold. As the day progressed, the mound of winter essentials steadily dwindled, alongside other resources scattered throughout the gymnasium—canned foods, handheld Narcan, and more. Across the room, free medical tents were at full capacity, a steady stream of individuals seeking care at New Britain Middle School. The picture of unaffordable health care in my state was clear. For those walking through those doors, questions like ""Will I get medical attention?"" or ""Do I have enough socks for winter?"" were not hypothetical but daily struggles.

Many early Saturday mornings during my first year of college were spent at a soup kitchen. I handed out warm bowls of oatmeal, engaged in brief conversations while pouring coffee, and distributed food containers. Visitors often arrived wearing hospital bands or medical gowns, yet expressed gratitude for the smallest gestures. Their resilience inspired me, but the lingering question was, ""What more can I do?""

Joining Honors Across State Borders deepened this question. During a spring break trip to Hagerstown, Maryland, I saw the effects of housing insecurity firsthand, assisting Habitat for Humanity in building homes. In Charleston, West Virginia, I encountered families struggling to meet basic needs due to a lack of social programs. These experiences ignited my passion for working with underserved populations and strengthened my commitment to providing compassionate care.

To deepen my understanding of healthcare, I became a pediatric medical assistant (MA) float at Connecticut Children’s Medical Center. This role exposed me to a wide range of specialties, from performing EKGs and administering Holter monitors on newborns to measuring A1C levels in a diabetes clinic. Floating into primary care for the first time revealed unique challenges, including addressing the needs of overwhelmed parents seeking WIC forms or families struggling with insurance coverage. One moment stands out: a young couple distressed over their newborn’s failure to thrive. They faced mounting medical expenses and uncertainty. By listening to their concerns, offering reassurance, and emphasizing the team’s dedication, I realized medicine is not just about clinical treatment. It’s also about providing hope and clarity.

While I valued my role as an MA, I wanted to build deeper connections with patients and expand my ability to impact their care. Often, I found myself imagining how I might treat a condition if I had a broader scope of practice. Shadowing an orthopedic pediatric PA named Marta solidified my decision. I observed Marta’s interaction with a 10-year-old boy with a nondisplaced radius-ulna fracture. As she molded the cast, the boy began to cry, and soon his mother followed. Despite her busy schedule, Marta stayed to console them, demonstrating compassion and commitment. Witnessing her ability to provide both clinical expertise and emotional support affirmed that the PA profession was the right fit for me.

Becoming a PA is a challenging journey, but my experiences have prepared me. Although my GPA initially struggled during my adjustment to college, I took proactive steps to improve. I earned 35 credits in one year with a DIY post-bacc, retaking science prerequisites, and excelling in upper-division neuroscience courses with a 4.0 GPA. Balancing patient care and volunteer work during this time demonstrated my perseverance and commitment.

One pivotal experience came when I helped administer a study on pediatric asthma at a community health fair. The study aimed to identify asthma triggers among underserved children and provide families with actionable resources to reduce hospital visits. Witnessing the direct impact of education and preventative care on families reinforced my belief in the power of patient-centered medicine. This moment further solidified my drive to bridge the gap between clinical care and community outreach as a PA.

Service goes beyond providing winter essentials or supplemental medical aid; it’s about being a compassionate listener and advocate. As a PA, I will offer a holistic approach to medicine, prioritizing the person before the disease to ensure comfort and quality care for all. I am ready to embrace this role and make a meaningful difference in the lives of my patients.

1hc211x,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfpublish/comments/1hc211x/things_i_learned_from_selling_at_my_first_book/,Things I Learned From Selling At My First Book Fair,"I finally plucked up the courage to put on my extrovert hat and venture forth to **The Oxford Indie Book Fair** (in the UK) to show off my book for the first time in person. I learned a lot from my adventure and thought others might find it helpful.

**1 - Bring Obvious Bits**

It’s worth making a checklist of all the obvious things to bring because you’re bound to forget something! Stuff like pens for signing, paper for notes, portable charger, snacks, tablecloth, and book stands are all easy to overlook. 

The plastic bookstands I bought were cheap and portable. Stacked on top of a pile of books, they added dynamic height without carrying a big shelf. Critical if you are car-less!

Bookmarks were also a must. I had some whipped up on Vistaprint pretty cheaply, and they even have a designing tool you can use. Bookmarks are a great way to connect with people on the fence about buying. However, I should have put on a discreet QR code with a unique redirect to track the success rate.

**2 - The Right Stock**

I brought waaaay too many books. A little optimistic on my part, and sadly, it broke the wheels on the suitcase! I sold 20 books, which I think was above average (I heard of other authors selling around 5 books). My sequel sold the least at only three copies. So, the first book in a series will likely sell at least four times as much as any sequel.

**3 - Helpers Are Helpful**

Luckily for me, my lovely partner came with me, and she was the perfect assistant! Running off to get me lunch and coffee, leaving me to sell sell sell. It’s also nice to have moral support and someone to help with carrying. Plus, I could go to the loo without worrying that I was abandoning ship.

**4 - Finding Your Audience**

As a fantasy author, I could spot the demographics that would be most interested. Basically, the fun nerds! The people at that kind of book fair were generally less interested in fantasy, so perhaps I would do better at comic conventions. However, I did have a trick to find the right crowd…

**5 - Lure Them In**

I had a fabulous gimmick to attract customers: if they could roll a 20 on a 20-sided die, they would win a free book. This was a BIG hit. It gave people a reason to stop, and then I could do my sales pitch. It also attracted people who like fantasy, who would immediately recognise the iconic ‘D20’. One person ran over after simply HEARING the die roll from afar. It added excitement to every encounter. It attracted the right crowd for my fantasy comedy book.

There were almost 200 rolls, and I had 7 people win a book (maths will tell you I beat the odds). It was interesting to see people’s reactions, too. Some people were clearly in the market for a freebie and were indifferent to me. Fortunately, they didn’t win. 

Each book costs me around £4 to print, but I think £28 was well worth it to attract 200 people! The people who did win may go on to leave reviews or buy the sequel.

I advise anyone looking to sell at a book fair or similar: have a lure. It should be fun and free. Bowls of sweets were popular, but I don’t think they helped. Try to think of a game or prize you can play that matches your genre. Like *“Spot the Murderer in 10 Seconds”* if you are in mystery, or *“How Many Hershey Kisses Are in the Jar”* if you are in romance.

Next time, however, I’ll bring disinfectant for the much-handled die.

**6 - Gather Data**

Counting the rolls was a good way to track my direct interactions. Bookmarks were a good marker (pun intended) of ‘maybes’. I gave them to people who I spoke to who seemed interested but didn’t want to buy the book then and there. There’s a very good chance they won’t, but you never know. 

I gave away 69 bookmarks, and 196 people rolled the dice, with 20 sales, which amounts to around a 10% success rate. We can imagine the bookmark takers are hard ‘maybe’s’, so that’s a 35% connection rate. The organisers said there were around 1500 visitors who attended the event. Therefore, I managed to sell to just over 1% of the visitors.

I don’t know how all this compares to other events and authors, but it’s a good future reference point! Would love to hear about other peoples statistics.

**7 - Location, Location, Location**

My table was right by the entrance - but I don’t know if that was good or not. You would think that you could catch more people's attention, but people often used the excuse that they had “only just arrived” and wanted to shop around rather than buy my book. I wonder if a different placement would change that. Perhaps people at the other end of the hall would be the last seen, and therefore, the customer's decision would be clearer by then? I would need to experiment to really know! 

**8 - Don’t Miss Networking**

I probably could have networked more with other authors. It is such a great opportunity to see what other people are doing and make connections. However, my dice game kept a constant stream of people coming, so I barely had a moment once the doors opened! The next time, I’ll probably feel more “at home” and will take a moment to speak with the other authors before the event starts.

**9 - Have Proper Signage**

The other author’s big banners looked really cool, so I may try to get one made for my next book fair. I just had a framed poster on an easel. Many people stopped to pick up my book and read the blurb, which was a little awkward to watch them read all 250 words. I think having a sign/banner with an abbreviated blurb for people to read from afar would be well worth it.

**10 - Take All Payments**

I thought needed a sign with the prices and payment types. However, people would still ask about the prices and if I took cash or card. Many simply expected me to take card payments. Luckily, I used the Zelle app on my phone, and it worked great. After an hour, I took down the price sign, which didn’t change anything. One less sign to worry about! It also meant I could reduce prices and make cheeky deals as appropriate.

Furthermore, the younger crowd was often interested in the book but didn’t want to spend money. Poor students can barely afford the heating bills, after all! I think next time, I will offer a sizable student discount. A sale is a sale!

\-

Anyway, that was everything I learned from my experience. I’m sure there is much more to discover in the world of book fairs… which I look forward to discovering! I hope it helps some of you out there, too.",10,1733946028.0,selfpublish,0,1.0,False

We had been video chatting on bumble for like 5 minutes. He asked if I would like to go there or have him drive to my city to meet for coffee. I said he could drive here, which he looked irritated by. (It's an hour's drive. 10years ago, I would have done the drive. But I've realized it's better to see a man put in effort.) I asked what he did for work, and he told me that he quit his job. I asked why, as quitting a job out of the blue can be a red flag. He said for work-life balance. Which, to me is weird because I would never quit a job without having a backup in place. He did not have a backup.

In our conversation, I said that a fwb situation would be nice. This is something that he asked me if I were interested in at the start. While I told him it would be nice, I also told him it would take me time to get to know him and see if there were chemistry and all that. Then I asked about STD testing. And all of a sudden. I'm weird.

So. There you have it. Putting effort into seeing a woman is weird. Getting to know someone is weird. Health is weird.

Quitting your job and laying around at home? Normal. Something to aspire to.


Edit: when he called me weird, I said, ""What?"" He repeated himself, adding on the vibe thing. I said, ""Oh, ok."" And I immediately ended the call and unmatched him.",174,1733945881.0,TwoXChromosomes,30,0.95,False
1hc1yqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_starbucks_lover98/comments/1hc1yqk/about_my_username/,About my username ,"Salam to my fellow lurkers. It’s been a while since I made a post on my page. I haven’t made a Note to Self post in a while due to being super busy but I’m getting back on it. 

I just need to address something about my username and I cannot believe I had to come to this. Now, I only see this problem in Muslim subreddit anytime I comment which was why I had been steering away and not participating as much as I use to. Wallahi I thought we would be more understanding and not jump to conclusions but here we are now. Ever since the genocide, I’ve been receiving comments such as “you support mass killings” or “you love a company that supports genocide”. Some even going as far as saying I shouldn’t speak on certain matters because I supposedly am a genocide lover. 

To make a few things clear: 

1. I made this username in June 2019 and during a time where my mental health had been in an all time low. I made the account because I believed Reddit was a good place for me to go to for comfort during those trying times. I’ve had extreme family issues as well. My mother and I were at each others throats (mainly for no reason. I would come home and BAM, fighting would happen) and I needed an escape so I went to Reddit. I worked two jobs simply to escape home life as I couldn’t afford to move out and I felt like I was not a good enough of a person so I was pushing my limits trying to please my family to prove I wasn’t a loser. Back then, they all had unrealistic expectations of me. But Reddit literally saved my life. I was actually on the verge of suicide and had contemplated taking my own life a few times. When I made this account, I couldn’t come up with a good username without giving my identity away so I had a Starbucks drink in my hand and went “oh how about starbucks_lover98” and the rest was history. I’ve been pressured to delete my account a few times but I refuse to do so mainly because of the history I had with this account. If I delete this account, I’m not gonna return to Reddit. So deal with it. 

2. My heart aches for what had been happening to our brothers and sisters in Gaza and the footages coming out of there had been too much but word has to get out there. I have also kept in contact with a couple of them and we would have light hearted conversations and I would check on them and see how they’re doing. Believe me when I say if I really was a genocide lover, I wouldn’t have given two fucks about anyone over there. I’m a Muslim and have a heart. So if you’re gonna be superficial and immediately think the worst of me, then congratulations for having a lack of social-emotional intelligence and critical thinking skills!! You’re not that special as a good chunk of people in the world unfortunately have the same defects as you. As Muslims, we need to give our brothers and sisters the benefit of the doubt and always think good of them and not bad. If our beloved Prophet (SAW) were to see how we treat one another, do you think he would be happy? Absolutely not! 

3. Finally, I haven’t had Starbucks in over a year. I make my own drinks at home or I go to other coffee shops that do not support evil. My bank account is happy lol.

This is going to be my first and only post clearing up the matter. Even though I am anonymous I feel like I have to clear my name because sadly there are some idiots out there who truly think I support genocide and the mass killings of the innocent men, women, and children in Gaza. I’m taking my sweet time writing this post to get this off my chest. 

If you still believe I support genocide because of my username alone, then may Allah give you intelligence because clearly you need it. 

Take care,

Hey all,

I'm a reporter for a newspaper and the other day I filed a story where my source, during the interview, was being very critical of his employer (happened to be a school board.) Keep in mind this was during a scheduled, recorded interview call. Everything he said about his experience with dealing with the school board as his employer was true, relevant and contributed to what he was speaking to me about for the story. I felt like personally saying ""Uh, are you sure you want to say that?"" but figured it wasn't my place.

Fast forward to publication, he sends me a line and requests to call me. Sure, no problem. I usually don't communicate with sources too much post-publication as most times they are retroactively trying to make changes or go off the record, but I gave this guy the benefit of the doubt.

Long story short, told me he loved the article, thought it was great, but that the school board had contacted him enraged for speaking ""on their behalf"" and are threatening him to the point where he feels he may lose his job with them. He wasn't trying to shake me down, more so letting me know what happened and asking if there was anything I could do.

I felt really bad for the guy, of course. Contacted my editor and explained the situation where we both came to the point of ""you made your bed, now lay in it"" sorta thing. Everything he said was during an interview he requested with our paper, on-the-record and all truthful. It's too bad that his employer isn't happy with (they feel their image has been impacted) but what can we do about it after the fact?

It is one thing if had we spoken over coffee off-the-record and another if through an interview for our paper. However, I still feel bad even though I was simply doing my job as a reporter. Any thoughts on this? Should I have done something differently?",6,1733944871.0,Journalism,5,1.0,False

I am a Youtube Channel Manager and algorithm specialist. I am providing all the information you need to build your own Social Media side hustle. I break down the algorithms so you don't get stuck at 500 views anymore. These techniques can be used for any type of channel even faceless channels.

If you have missed the previous posts I have write ups 100% freely available on a wiki I created.  
There is no signup, just a place to put the long form breakdowns of the algorithms.  
I have recently added Meta/Instagram to the list of Algorithms.

All the writeups are available at: [https://wiki.channelyzer.com](https://wiki.channelyzer.com)

This community has been so awesome with interaction on these posts I wanted to talk about the next step.  
In the first post I explained the algorithm and why most people are struggling, the second I talked about mind set. In this one I want to talk about Monetization.

When to monetize and how to monetize.

This can come down to a few factors as always, but my rule of thumb is to start the process when reaching 5000 subscribers.   ""Really this early?"" Absolutely.  You want to start early as your going to do this as you build your community. When you have reached this level of subscribership it is time to figure out how your going to build your subscribers into a community.

Why build a community?  
People who subscribe your channel are buying into your message and buying into you as a creator. You will find that some people want more access to you and what your doing. This also creates a closer bond between viewer and creator.

Ok but how do I monetize and is Youtube Advertising Revenue enough?  
Short answer is you should always be working to monetize out side of the platform your on as much as possible. There are a lot of reasons for this but the most glaring is that the platform revenue share is quite low in comparison to what you would expect. I won't give you the exact revenue share for each platform but you can find them pretty much everywhere (even though the platform requests you don't share it).

Lets say you have a viral video that hits a million views... You might only get $10 000 showing in your earnings panel, but also remember that there is then revenue sharing. You may only see $5000 or $6000 of that, then you have income taxes on top of that. In most cases your walking away with less than 40% of any money made on a platform through their advertising revenue share.

So how can you monetize outside of the platform?  
\- Patreon (building a community providing perks)  
\- Ko-fi (buy me a coffee link)  
\- Merch sales

And once the channel is large enough, brand deals.

Here is an example of a well monetized Youtube Channel setup.

Revenue sources:  
\- Youtube Ads  
\- Youtube Live Streams (super chats and stickers)  
\- Patreon (community based)  
\- Merch sales

So on Youtube live streams are not for building your subscriber base but for building that connecting with your community. If people like what your doing you can receive superchats/stickers, but more importantly you can build an off platform community (Facebook page, discord ect.....)

In my group of clients we look at Ad revenue, merch sales as your play money (bonus cash every month)  
Superchats and Patreon are your consistent income sources and can be relied on for budgets, and cost of living.

Most people get into social media as a side hustle but forget to build it like a business.  
You need your consistent income sources and optimize for income.

Why would anyone join my Patreon?  
This is because people are buying into you as a creator, and buying into your community and want to support what your doing because of the value your providing them (education, entertainment, ect....)  
If your providing value to a viewer and they really like what they are doing, some will want to support what your doing.

Great Case Study:  
The Youtube channel The Why Files  
This is a very large channel now, but monetized fairly early on. How this is done for this channel?

Video released weekly using Youtube's Premier Function.  
Followed up right away with a Live Stream talking about the most recent video and answering questions.  
This builds their off platform community (discord) and also helps promote the Patreon. Also provides a large injection of income from the Super Chats from the live stream.

This is a perfectly setup monetization system.  
Video pulls new subscribers, new subscribers come to the live stream, interact with the incredibly strong community, join the discord and some will in the end join the Patreon and buy merch.

This post is getting a bit long so I think I will end this here.  
As always if you have questions leave a comment or reach out.

I hope this helps anyone who faces the same issue. If the dial for the grinder setting is not matching the display anymore (i.e you can still turn the dial, but the number has already reached 30) there is a quite simple fix for this. Open the machine, all you need is a Philips screwdriver (+) and remove the 6 screws on the back after taking of the water tank and 2 more from below the mashine, one near the coffee grind outlet and the other one near the steam nozzle. 

Important: Now dial the wheel either to the maximum or minimum setting. I chose the most coarse one in the pictures.

Take off the top cover, now remove one (1) of the screw of the small white gear thingy (circled in red) 

Push it a bit away from the big black gear and turn it. The mashine has to be powered on at this stage, in order to see the display. Turn until you see a change on the displayed number. Now tune it to 30 (or 1, if you dialed to very fine previously) and re-attach it to the big black gear. Fasten all the screws again and re-asssmble.

Done. ✅ ",1,1733944805.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Ingredients: Sunny Almond Vanilla Pod, 1 Cup Whole Milk, 1 Swiss Miss Milk Chocolate Hot Chocolate Packet

1. Mix together 1 cup of milk with the hot chocolate packet in the Aeroccino and then set to froth (hot).
2. Once it's done frothing, transfer to your mug of choice.
3. Brew the sunny almond vanilla pod over the hot chocolate.
4. Stir and enjoy.

It's my first time trying this, so I'm not sure what substitutions work best for this recipe. I'm curious to what other pods would pair well with hot chocolate, so if you have recommendations, please let me know.

The last two days I’ve been feeling symptoms that I’ve never felt before. It feels like my chest area is empty and I feel sooo weak on the left side of my body overall; even though I can actually lift my arm and do things. Last night I almost had a panic attack in my sleep because I literally thought I was dying. Felt out of breath and like I didn’t have a heart. Has anyone else felt this way? There’s no chest pain at all. Just this uncomfortable weakness that I’m not able to wrap my head around. I also feel really jittery and tired all the time even though I don’t drink coffee.

PS. I have an Apple Watch, pulse oximeter and BP monitor so that I can feel relief before going into proper fight and flight mode; in which case I would rush to the ER which I really cannot afford anymore.

Jim - As 2024 nears an end- Trade Tariffs, China, Critical Minerals & a new administration are on deck. The table is set for Critical Minerals to take center stage.

1. *\*\*\*Are several entities such as (DoD, U.S. & Allied Governments & Private Industries) “STILL” Interested securing Off-take Agreements for Niocorp's remaining Critical Minerals (Titanium, Niobium 25%, Rare Earths, CaCO3, MgCO3 & some Iron stuff* ***as 2025 approaches?****) - Should Financing be secured??*

 RESPONSE:

***""Several USG agencies are working with us to potentially provide financing to the Elk Creek Project.  And, yes, we are in discussions with the National Defense Stockpile, which (like much of the USG) is much more intensely interested in seeing U.S. production of scandium catalyze a variety of defense and commercial technologies.""***

He has her Wednesdays, Thursdays, and every other weekend, and I’m at his house almost every day, only going home maybe one or two days a week. For context, he and the baby mom were together for eight years, engaged, and split up last year. She’s been with her boyfriend for about eight months.

Here’s where I need help: In the fall, I attended his daughter’s soccer games and practices to support her. The baby mom was there too, along with her parents sometimes, and there were no issues. I even met the baby mom for coffee once so she could meet me.

My GF told me she didn't want to attend anymore.,"Recap: I am a NeverMo whose girlfriend was baptized about 6 months ago. She never followed any rules (coffee, abstinence, tithing, etc.). 2 weeks ago I agreed to come with her to Church to get to know it. [Link to my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/s/i9BrggvAMp)

What apparently broke her shelf was a talk given by the stake president one Sunday where he spoke about how God would ""forgive"" anyone who really wanted to get married but couldn't and ended up single for life. My GF thought that it was very harmful to teach people that your only goal in life is to get married. I told her that the Church members have an immense pressure on getting married as it is the ultimate goal because that's how you get to the highest degree of heaven. I didn't want overwhelm her at the moment so we agreed to ask the missionaries the following Tuesday.

When we met the missionaries, she asked them what they believed about marriage. They confirmed what the stake president said and then talked about the levels of heaven. I then started questioning them about polygamy and DC 132. My GF then asked them about the priesthood and women and how they can't access to major roles in the Church. I don't think the missionaries were prepared for the questions and their responses were felt shallow. It seemed as if they had never heard about DC 132 since they were reading it with close attention and surprise.

On the next morning I asked my GF something about the church. She said she was angry and didn't want to attend anymore. Honestly, I was surprised. She already knew about the polygamy stuff, racism, Book of Abraham but I guess the marriage thing is where she drew the line. I don't think she ever believed on Joseph Smith anyway. I think that she thought all of that didn't matter as long as the church today was a good place to be and raise children. Hearing the words directly from church leadership and the missionaries opened her eyes I guess.

Anyways, I know this may not be over. I am aware that the missionaries will keep knocking probably forever. Last Sunday we didn't go to church and we spent more time together. We may end up attending another church since that is what she wishes and I am fine with that as long as it is a healthy environment. I feel very relieved. We have been together for 6 years, love her very much, want to marry her soon and this might have been a dealbreaker. Even if she eventually returns, I think she would agree that raising children there is not a good idea.

As natives, where do you guys go to socialize and make friends? Do any of you guys wanna be friends lol? 

I’d say I’m an overall friendly person. I’m really into poetry, coffee, literature, vampire media, and alternative music scenes. I’ll be staying in the Hyde Park/Kenwood area if that helps! Thank you all! 

TLDR: How do you make friends when you’re new to the city? I’m 19 and new to Chicago.

I had previously posted [my story right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1gp1825/lo_had_to_be_a_coworker/), and I'm now confused about my LO. I'll try to keep it as short as possible.

Today I went down to the cafeteria by myself since my coworkers weren't on site, I accidentally bumped into my LO while going downstairs. Had already seen her earlier that day when I went to grab coffee, I stopped to say hi and what's up then left. Anyway we saw each other going downstairs, I expected her to wait for me so we'd walk to the cafeteria together but she didn't stop and she kept walking.

My limerent brain entered doom mode: ""wow she really doesn't care about me, wah wah"".

Then she just walked past the cafeteria so my dumb brain was like ""oh I guess she had to go somewhere else first, she didn't actually plan on ignoring me like that"". Yeah not everything is about you, idiot.

I started warming up my lunch then saw her enter the place a few minutes later, she grabbed stuff she had left at a table packed with coworkers she knows well, I heard some of them insisting ""stay, we can squeeze in!"" but she said ""no no it's all good"" and she left them. Then she walked towards me and asked me where I was gonna sit, I was like ""oh, I don't know"". 

She then smiled and said ""I'll stay with you"" and put her stuff next to mine, I then asked where she wanted to sit and she picked for us to sit in a booth. So we sat next to each other, it felt so... romantic somehow?

Anyway I couldn't believe any of this was actually happening. Leaving her buddies to choose to sit with me? Me? Just me? Holy crap, she chose me? And just before that my stupid limerent brain thought she didn't like me or was uncomfortable around me? Ugh, wow.

This is the first time we ate just the two of us, usually there were always at least one more person around. Anyway, I went out of my way to make the conversation interesting, engaging and fun, trust me I gave it ALL...

I shared some fruit with her for dessert, she then waited for me to finish my coffee and we left together. I held the door to her office for her like I always do, it makes her laugh every time because people usually don't hold a door they're not planning to go through themselves. But I do because you know, limerence.

A few days ago she also gave me tea because I told her I liked tea... So she gave me two boxes of tea. She said they were too strong for her but one of the boxes she gave me had a lot of different ones, almost new. It confused me to the point that I asked her later if she truly didn't like any of the ones she gave me cause there were so many different ones. She just said that she tried them all and only liked one the most. 

And believe it or not, but even after the tea thing my brain thought she felt uncomfortable around me, or didn't like me that much, or found me weird. And then the cafeteria thing happened. She does not dislike me. I just hope my brain will understand this and won't give me more ridiculous lows for no reason (""oh no maybe she feels uncomfortable around me"").

Now I'm just confused as to what to do with any of this. Or process any of this.

I'm really struggling with asking her to hang out outside of work. Oh and of course I'm riding a hell of a high right now, all that dopamine today...",6,1733943516.0,limerence,1,1.0,False

Currently the executive chef in fancy ski inn. Maximum 36 clients per night and the stays are for 4 nights then 3 nights. This setup is for the full winter season so there's a client reset every 4 night or 3 nights. We do entree and desserts by plates and for the main dish we serve big plates to the table with proteins (meat, seafood or fish), carbs, vegetables, sauce and people serve themself (6 big plates for 36 clients). The reservation system include intolerance and allergies since there's no set menu so the customers eats what is on the set menu that night. We serve the customers with specials request by the plates.  


What i'm looking for easy ideas that is portionnable, can frozen and is vegan/vegetarian for the main dish.   
Right now i have;  
\-2 x 3 oz black bean pattys that is sear and then in the oven served with a homemade vegetable demi glace.  
\-2 x 2 oz white bean pattys that are covered in panko and fried then serve with a tapenade.  
\-2 x rectangle of polenta cake that i dust with flour and fry then serve with a chimichurri or variations.

The same applies to the dessert. Something easy to defrost at night serve and then add a nice topping to it.  
Right now my options are:  
\-Vegan chocolate mousse with coffee syrup and torrefied hazelnut.  
\-Vegan deconstructed cheese cake with a haskap berry coulis and almond crumble.  
\-Vegan crème brulée.  
\-Panna cotta with seabuckthorn juice.

Any ideas are welcomed. Thank you so much redditers and i'm looking forward to see what you guys come up with :)!

I was lucky to have learned enough about the principles of contracts and negotiating and finance in business school and I'm personable enough to be in sales....

But after riding out a downturn way back before the pandemic, I realized that being able to negotiate and learning how to find the right house for people and how to market and how to meet potential clients and turn referrals and make cold calls and all that stuff is important but its mostly teachable and its not enough. 

The lending piece is outsourced, so is most of the title diligence etc...so I came to realize that it's about working as hard when you've just closed $4mm in a quarter as you do when you haven't closed a deal in 12 weeks (months)


It's about having the drive and commitment to learn to do what it takes to be a success...and you can indeed LEARN to do what it takes.... but you HAVE to invest 💰 💰 in your business to get started and you have to trade time or capital ( 💰 💰) to keep new clients coming in and to keep referrals coming in too, and that lasts forever....but more importantly it's about self discipline. 


You have to be willing to work when you don't want to. You can't take a month off because you closed a big deal and you're flush...bc it'll take you three months to catch up. And you have to have the discipline to force yourself you to do things that make you uncomfortable or scared or nervous (or all 3). You can't be afraid to ask for business...you can't be shy about talking to people you don't know...you can't be uncomfortable making cold calls or answering cold lead calls...


And you have to have the discipline to say yes to anyone who asks you to show them a house or meet them to discuss selling one WHENEVER THEY ASK YOU TO.... You will work when your clients tell you to work...sure you can tell people no and you can set hours blah blah blah but if you want to succeed as a solo agent you have to go when there's someone who wants you to go. If you want more freedom you gotta hire someone to be on your team, and that requires the ability to manage a BUSINESS AND AN EMPLOYEE and that ain't easy...that takes even more self discipline

As soon as the rates started to climb back up after the pandemic I took about 6 months off of retail Realtoring to focus on some development projects...which means I didn't pay for advertising or post on social or go to any events to meet clients, I basically only did retail if the phone rang...then I got bored and I wanted back in before the cycle ticked back up...well I did about 50% of the hustling that I did when I first started in RE and it took me about 9 months to get back to where I was before as far as income...but I had to spend a lot of money and make a lot of calls and meet for lunches and dinners and it was a grind...

To me that proves everything I mentioned above but I could be wrong and it could all be luck...but I also have a huge network and I knew what I needed to do (AND SPEND) to get back on top

So all that said: I believe it's been my ability to motivate MYSELF and push MYSELF that's allowed me to become a top producer...everything else is coachable...but when you are all alone and your wallet is fat will you still be able to push yourself to get up and go make the calls and shake the hands and buy the coffees and show the houses and write the contracts and so on and so on until you move on...and when the phone stops ringing will you be willing to pivot and do what it takes to make it ring again???",8,1733942818.0,realtors,4,0.79,False

NOT actual security guards.

I (28F) work at one of the MAANG’s and today morning at 9.30am, I was in a Virtual meeting in a quiet room at the office when I heard really loud aggressive voices outside the room. I minded my own business for 40 mins until it was too much and I just couldn’t hear the other person on the call above them. 

I go outside and see two cleaning people talking/fighting [in a language I don’t understand] with each other and making big gestures with their hands. I politely ask them if they could please talk a bit quietly to which one of them said yes, yes okay! I go back inside and resume my meeting only to have them back at it again after 10 mins.

I was in an important meeting and just kept getting distracted because of this so I went downstairs to the security personnels and told them that two people on my floor were at it and that it was very distracting. One security person said they’d go up and talk to them while  the other thanked me for letting them know. 

There’s a cafe 5 steps from the reception area where I made a quick pit stop to grab coffee (5 mins total time) and when I returned, there was a commotion near the security desk and the cleaning person yelling even more loudly and other security staff trying to calm her down. The moment they saw me - they got angrier and said repeatedly - “YOU BAD”, “WHY YOU COMPLAIN?!”, “I DID’T DO ANYTHING!”, “GO COMPLAIN TO MY MANAGER, FIRE ME! I DON’T CARE!”. “YOU COME DOWN AND COMPLAIN, WHY??”. 

I stood there coffee in hand, dumbfounded; not knowing what to do. I just told the security personnel over there about the situation and apologised saying I just wanted to inform you because it was disturbing and that I’m sorry to which they replied - “It’s okay, you’re good. They were just talking loudly, nothing else. They didn’t realise that they’re not supposed to do this in an office premise. It’s a culture difference or rather a culture thing. You’re good, it’s okay, it’s okay”.

I've been struggling with dating and making more effort to put myself out there since as a 32 year man who really values starting a family, I feel a certain sense of pressure to meet that right person before age becomes a limiting factor for everyone. I've only been on a few dates with this woman and generally had not been interested in or looking for a stepfather role, and the idea of 3 kids is intimidating. When discussing the idea of having a fourth (which would be important to me) came up, she was really positive about the idea. 

When we initially talked about a few surficial things, I'm aware that she's financially stable with a solid support network of friends, family and baby sitters nearby. So I don't feel like there's pressure on her end to meet someone to take responsibility off her shoulders, though I'm sure it would be an expectation once things get serious and one I find myself happy to fulfill as an equal partner, but her independence has been a big green flag. 

Even after a few dates, I am simply over the moon. I haven't connected with anyone on this level in a long time and with the solid communication so far, the feeling has been extremely mutual. It's been too early to seriously discuss hard facts and the truly tough topics, but I have zero concern about any difficulty in raising those subjects and it will probably come up in the next couple dates so we can move forward or identify any areas where our expectations won't match. 

I see a lot of negativity on this page (no judgement, just observing) and dynamics that require extremely deft navigation. Which makes sense, a lot of people reach out when the going gets tough, so those things will be highlighted in a forum like this and being a step parent is incredibly difficult. I'm interested in hearing the good stories and the reward that some of you have experienced but also any advice or questions I should ask that may not be obvious to someone in my position. 

The idea of being a dad fills me with an immense sense of joy, and the idea taking on someone else's kids doesn't deter me the way I thought it would even just a few weeks ago. This woman impresses the hell out of me and I feel like this could really be my shot, but I do have concerns about having my judgement slightly clouded by the excitement of meeting someone new on top of the financial obligation of that many kids (even if BD is contributing, I realize I will still be financing a fair share of things) and the added complication of the various interests involved. But nothing is ever really easy when it comes to raising a family and I just want to be as well informed as I can, with my head screwed on straight so I can respect the feelings of everyone involved and be surefooted and decisive as I move forward. 

There's probably a million other things I could add for context, but for brevity's sake, this is what I'll stick to. Any thoughts or comments are welcome. Thanks for taking the time to read and contribute :)",7,1733942389.0,stepparents,19,0.9,False

We're in the process of agreeing terms on a commercial unit, and I want to ensure we’re fully compliant with planning regulations. Here's a bit of context:

* The unit is currently classified under **E(g)**.
* we're looking to set up a wellness centre that primarily specialises in hot & cold contrast therapy through sauna and cold plunge. 
* The space will include a café space that offers amenities including coffee, protein shakes, juices, and hydration solutions, but no food.

Given the variety of our services, I'm unsure if our use fits neatly into E(g), or if we might need a different classification (perhaps E(d) for indoor recreation or something else entirely).

For clarity, as per the permitted use in the terms states: 'use as warehouse, workshop unit within Use Class E (g)'. 

If anyone has experience navigating use classes or insights I’d greatly appreciate your input. Should I be concerned about any potential issues when it comes to planning permission or change of use?

1hc06a6,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAllergies/comments/1hc06a6/shellfish_allergy_takes_many_formsa/,Shellfish Allergy Takes Many Forms!!!a,"Thought I'd share what I'm going through atm here in the hopes it helps soneone else:

For the last 2 yrs or so I thought I had developed IBS or a food sensitivity, specifically to egg protein. On and off I would have spells of stomach cramping, bloating, gas and diarrhea. It would coincide a lot with when I ate eggs, so I started avoiding eating them in natural form but the problem didn't go away.

I was also having hives periodically, always on my elbows and sometimes behind my knees. Applying Cortisone cream or eczema cream would help, but they kept reoccuring. I tried changing laundry detergents, replacing place mats since I lean on my elbows at the table, changing my routine allergy medication...they kept coming back. 

Back in May I saw my GP for a checkup and mentioned all this, so with my annual bloodwork she ordered an allergen panel.

It came back...with a moderate reaction to shellfish. No reaction to egg protein.

I do not routinely eat shellfish, but I have occasionally all my life. I am now 32. My wife is allergic and my immediate family dislikes it so it's never in the house and I don't order it out often. So what, I wondered, could be the connection?

It turns out that shellfish allergies can make you cross-reactive to other arthropodal species, most often cockroaches but really any insect.

In my case...I am a heavy coffee drinker. We have a Keurig in the house. Pre-ground coffee, esp. industrially produced, can have a high instance of insect parts ib it due to pest contamination. Especially roaches.

Fast-forward to late October. I develop what I think is a bladder infection; most of the symptoms are present, like pain and urgency, but there is no cloudiness or blood in my urine. An urgent care visit, an ER admittance, two separate urinalyses, bloodwork and an abdominal CT scan are...inconclusive. There is no sign of an infection anywhere. They send me home, I go to my GP, she prescribes an antibiotic just in case. It seemed to help, but the symptoms have recurred on and off since then. A *third* urinalysis about a week ago, plus a bacterial culture, still showed nothing indicating any kind of infection. 

Today I figured it out. 

The past few days I had been having the usual G.I. allergic reaction symptoms I've gotten used to- but simultaneously, the bladder pain and urgency came back with it. The only thing I'd been eating consistently the past 2-3 days was a grocery store brand potato chip, turkey and stuffing flavored. I stop eating them, 36 hrs later the G.I. symptoms stop- *but so do the bladder symptoms.*

After a run to Google...I learned that ingesting food allergens can lead to Allergic Bladder, or Irritable Bladder Syndrome, *which mimics a bladder infection almost perfectly.* That's what's been going on since October! It's not the WHOLE problem, there were some other things going on when I went to the ER, but it explains SO MUCH.

Looking into an allergist now, because I don't want this progressing into interstitial cystitis. This means that everything that isn't an animal product, produce, or unprocessed (ex whole bean coffee)- or super-heated or deep-frozen (to denature the insect protein, like frozen dinners or simmered soup)- is a risk for a reaction. Even a big-brand tea bag may have made me react at one point.

Moral is: those with shellfish allergies, look into foods that may contain high numbers of insect parts, and be careful of industrially processed foods either way!!!

1hc0550,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamondsreview/comments/1hc0550/diamond_color_guide_expert_tips_and_complete/,Diamond Color Guide: Expert Tips and Complete Value Analysis,"Diamond color grading spans from D (colorless) to Z (light yellow), with market data showing that I-G grades offer optimal value, providing a visually colorless appearance while costing 30-50% less than F-D grades. Analysis reveals that 65% of natural diamonds’ engagement ring purchases occur in the near-colorless range, where value and aesthetics intersect most favorably.

Setting choices significantly impact color perception in diamonds. White metal settings demand higher color grades for optimal appearance, while yellow and rose gold settings can reflect their color into the diamond, making it appear more yellowish.

This comprehensive guide provides simple yet smart strategies for navigating diamond color selection, including setting-specific recommendations, size-based adjustments, and expert methodologies for maximizing visual performance while optimizing budget allocation.

# Bottom Line:

When selecting a diamond, understanding color is crucial for both aesthetics and value:

* Grading Scale: D (colorless) to Z (light yellow), with D being the rarest and most sought-after.
* Value Sweet Spot: H color offers an excellent balance of value and appearance, looking nearly colorless while costing up to 30%-40% less than D or E grades.
* Setting Matters: White metals accentuate color, while yellow gold can mask it. Consider your setting when choosing a color grade.
* Size and Shape Impact: Larger diamonds and specific cuts may show more color. For color-sensitive buyers, aim for G-H range, especially in white metal settings.
* Always get a grading report from a reputable lab like GIA to ensure accurate color assessment.

* Lab-grown diamonds are much more affordable. You can buy a similar D colorless lab-grown diamond at a 70%-80% lower price tag or invest in a larger and better lab diamond.
* To properly inspect a diamond's color, view it from the side profile. This angle minimizes sparkle and brilliance, allowing you to better detect any subtle tints in the stone.

* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing from trusted retailers that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

# Who is this for?

This guide is ideal for:

* First-time diamond buyers looking to understand color basics
* Budget-conscious shoppers aiming to maximize value
* Anyone wanting to make an informed decision about diamond quality

# Who is this not for?

This may be less relevant for:

* Buyers specifically seeking fancy colored diamonds
* Those with a predetermined preference for only the highest color grades
* Shoppers focused solely on unique shapes or cuts rather than traditional grading

# Recommendations for Smart Buying

1. Consider Near-Colorless: J-G diamonds often provide the best value, appearing colorless to the naked eye at a lower cost.
2. Match Color to Setting: Choose slightly lower color grades for yellow gold settings, but stick to higher grades for white metals.
3. Factor in Size: For larger diamonds (over 1 carat), consider going up a color grade as color becomes more noticeable.

1. Don't Neglect Cut: A well-cut diamond can appear brighter and whiter, sometimes compensating for slightly lower color grades.
2. See in Person: If possible, view diamonds in various lighting conditions to assess how color appears in real-world settings.

# FAQ

Q: How noticeable is the difference between color grades?  
A: To the untrained eye, differences between adjacent grades (e.g., G to H) are usually imperceptible, especially in smaller diamonds.

Q: Does fluorescence affect color?  
A: Blue fluorescence can sometimes make a diamond appear whiter, potentially allowing for a lower color grade without visible difference.

Q: Are D color diamonds worth the premium?  
A: While D colors are the rarest, the price jump from G-H to D can be significant. For most buyers, the difference isn't visually justifiable.

Q: How does diamond shape affect color perception?  
A: Round brilliants tend to hide color better than fancy shapes like emerald or asscher cuts, which may show more body color.

Remember, while color is important, it's just one aspect of a diamond's overall beauty and value. Consider all the 4Cs (Cut, Color, Clarity, and Carat) when making your decision.

It is one of the few coins that has proven to have grown steadily despite the difficult market conditions in late summer and has developed a hard core with its avid, convinced and unwavering community, similar to memecoin communities such as SHIB and PEPE recently, before experiencing incredible price explosions.

Although the price has dropped sharply, the distribution has improved significantly. Our number of holders has now reached almost 16,000 and the trend is clearly upwards (particularly the last 2 weeks). This means more than double since the ATH. The consolidation phase has eventually brought the community to its highest level. It went up numerically, is battle-tested, experienced, as ambitious and grinding as in the best of times and is now more convinced than ever.

The army is shilling 24/7 and wins each (fair) poll. The chads are promoting KENDU IRL, see much videos on X, competitions too. Even some passionate and highly talented artists are now representing our cult, check it out on the X profile. Some other fellows already made KENDU into a brand, especially with Kendu energy, coffee, jewelry and merch. KENDU energy. According to my information, there are plans to expand the energy drinks distribution from Australia and USA to other continents.

The most recent highlight is the free Certik audit we achieved, what took a lot of perseverance, willpower and conviction to reach 50,000 votes for that (please note: you can only vote once per day on Certik). The KENDU community is the second after Pepe to have managed this. This even impressed Certik so much that they suggested we create a joint awareness campaign. 
In addition to the achievement itself, the audit will massively increase the public credibility of the project and thus raise the interest from the top CEX (for listings) and, accordingly, from many new investors on this market. 

The significant increase in our holder count mentioned above shows that the community’s work has already paid off noticeably. Moreover, the number of X-Followers has more than doubled within 1.5 weeks and is now almost 30,000. On Reddit, the number of members has now risen to over 5,000 and in the TG chat to almost 11,000. KENDU even already maintains a Stocktwits page (as the 2nd meme coin ever).

What’s next:

- listing on CoinDCX (India's largest CEX)

- Certik awareness campaign

- launching NFT platform: revenues will be used to further CEX listings

- bridging to the Solana chain at the eoy (via Wormhole) and to Base (2025): new market accesses means more volume and liquidity

- Kendu event in Melbourne (February 2025)

- introduction of Kendu by DEV Miazaki at Shibcon 

- ...

KENDU is more than just a meme coin, it’s a movement. On the one hand, Miazaki has built an extraordinary community that spreads Kendu as a cult and brand, and on the other hand, he is cooking up the development of technological features such as the NFT platform or the multichain solution, which maximizes the Defi market reach for Kendu. 
KENDU is my alpha conviction play for the upcoming altseason, as it combines proven old-school approaches from well-established meme coins (but even more intense) with cutting-edge technological features. In addition, I have never seen a meme coin promoted by the community with real products for the project, which honestly fascinates me.

DYOR. I have been convinced since the first second I joined and I tell you, if you want to prefer an easier resp. a retired life, now is an excellent time to join the KENDU movement.

We don’t gamble, we work!

1hc00pm,https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/1hc00pm/i_just_got_evicted/,I just got evicted.,"I currently live with my best friends in a house owned by their dad in rural Georgia. For context - I used to live with my grandmother near Atlanta, but she passed away a couple years ago. For the last decade or so, I've been trying to make it as a cryptozoology youtuber. Right around the time my grandmother passed, I got kicked out of the partnership program (previously my only source of income) because of some technical bullshit, so at that point I was effectively homeless with no income. In an effort to help my situation, my friends offered to let me stay here while I worked toward making money again. Thankfully I lucked out with some inheritance from my grandmother, so I've been able to avoid being a leech by surviving on savings.

Today, I woke up at 9:00 in the morning to my friends' aunt, a known transphobe. This woman intentionally outed my friend, a trans man, to his entire extended family over an argument, among other things. Bear in mind I literally just met this woman last night. She came in, asked me to sit down and make *her* coffee (I didn't), and in a nutshell informed me that my friends' dad has decided that I need to be out by New Years, all the while making passive-aggressive transphobic comments about my appearance, telling me to ""put pants on"" (I was wearing booty shorts), to which I basically told her to go fuck herself.

She left a few minutes ago and now we're just trying to gather our wits after being blindsided like this. There was no warning. No discussion before hand. It went from ""hey, we'd love to have you!"" to ""get out of my house"" basically overnight. The aunt called their dad and I heard him say it himself, so it's not meddling on her part, at least not directly. His reasoning, apparently, is that I haven't been paying rent - which is technically true, but only because even after saying on multiple occasions that I'd be happy to do so, he's never made the effort to talk with me to work out the details. So in absence of that, I've been helping out around the house, paying for appliances, cat supplies, home repairs - to the point where I'm fairly certain I've payed \*more\* than my fair share of would-be rent.

It's so out of left field. I've been living here this whole time without incident, and none of the rest of us - my friends, their mom, their brother - had heard ANYTHING that could indicate this was coming. We're all incredibly confused and desperately trying to get to the bottom of this.

I have nowhere to go. My parents don't have the room, and even if they did, my dad is an abusive alcoholic transphobe himself. I can't go back to living there. I'm not about to ask for money and I know this kind of thing is pretty universally frowned upon here, but if anyone is into or knows people who would be into what I'm doing with youtube, I would immensely appreciate the help. I know there are rules about advertisements and videos here, so I'm not posting any links, but there's one in the descripton on my profile. I've been putting in the work, and I'm SO CLOSE to getting back in and being able to support myself again. I promise this isn't some shitty hair brained scheme to get views, I just... Don't know what else could help. If the mods decide to take this down, I'll understand. I don't know, I guess I'm just grasping at straws at this point.

It is one of the few coins that has proven to have grown steadily despite the difficult market conditions in late summer and has developed a hard core with its avid, convinced and unwavering community, similar to memecoin communities such as SHIB and PEPE recently, before experiencing incredible price explosions.

Although the price has dropped sharply, the distribution has improved significantly. Our number of holders has now reached almost 16,000 and the trend is clearly upwards (particularly the last 2 weeks). This means more than double since the ATH. The consolidation phase has eventually brought the community to its highest level. It went up numerically, is battle-tested, experienced, as ambitious and grinding as in the best of times and is now more convinced than ever.

The army is shilling 24/7 and wins each (fair) poll. The chads are promoting KENDU IRL, see much videos on X, competitions too. Even some passionate and highly talented artists are now representing our cult, check it out on the X profile. Some other fellows already made KENDU into a brand, especially with Kendu energy, coffee, jewelry and merch. KENDU energy. According to my information, there are plans to expand the energy drinks distribution from Australia and USA to other continents.

The most recent highlight is the free Certik audit we achieved, what took a lot of perseverance, willpower and conviction to reach 50,000 votes for that (please note: you can only vote once per day on Certik). The KENDU community is the second after Pepe to have managed this. This even impressed Certik so much that they suggested we create a joint awareness campaign. 
In addition to the achievement itself, the audit will massively increase the public credibility of the project and thus raise the interest from the top CEX (for listings) and, accordingly, from many new investors on this market. 

The significant increase in our holder count mentioned above shows that the community’s work has already paid off noticeably. Moreover, the number of X-Followers has more than doubled within 1.5 weeks and is now almost 30,000. On Reddit, the number of members has now risen to over 5,000 and in the TG chat to almost 11,000. KENDU even already maintains a Stocktwits page (as the 2nd meme coin ever).

What’s next:

- listing on CoinDCX (India's largest CEX)

- Certik awareness campaign

- launching NFT platform: revenues will be used to further CEX listings

- bridging to the Solana chain at the eoy (via Wormhole) and to Base (2025): new market accesses means more volume and liquidity

- Kendu event in Melbourne (February 2025)

- introduction of Kendu by DEV Miazaki at Shibcon 

- ...

KENDU is more than just a meme coin, it’s a movement. On the one hand, Miazaki has built an extraordinary community that spreads Kendu as a cult and brand, and on the other hand, he is cooking up the development of technological features such as the NFT platform or the multichain solution, which maximizes the Defi market reach for Kendu. 
KENDU is my alpha conviction play for the upcoming altseason, as it combines proven old-school approaches from well-established meme coins (but even more intense) with cutting-edge technological features. In addition, I have never seen a meme coin promoted by the community with real products for the project, which honestly fascinates me.

DYOR. I have been convinced since the first second I joined and I tell you, if you want to prefer an easier resp. a retired life, now is an excellent time to join the KENDU movement.

We don’t gamble, we work!

Top of the table is made out of glass plate that is on a wooden edge (see second photo).

My question would be: is there any sensor that would be able to detect such “weight change”?

He said he tends to go out just for me because he knows I like it. It’s sweet that he does but it still makes me sad because I would love for him to enjoy it more.
We tend to get takeout and occasionally icecream.

The culture in the industry, along with several other aspects, has been steering me away and making me consider a different career path.

Lately, I’ve been looking into policing as an option, but I’ve noticed there’s unfortunately a lot of gatekept information most people aren’t aware of. For example, they expect attendees to show up to information sessions in a suit and tie and to research their poorly constructed website beforehand.

I’ve tried emailing for more details, but most of my messages were ignored. When I went in person to gather more information, I was met by some very entitled receptionists. It’s tough dealing with people who seem to think they’re above you when they’re just two steps away from being in the same position I’m aiming for.

I was wondering if there are any police officers on here who’d be willing to have a quick phone call or maybe meet up for coffee or lunch to chat about the profession itself, not necessarily the process of getting into it. I think it’d be really helpful to connect with someone local, since talking to officers from other areas or countries doesn’t always translate well to what policing is like here.
