1psubv8,https://i.redd.it/hcnzsbfqsp8g1.jpeg,Decided to download the game again on a whim because I had a dream about Firefly,"Im seriously out of the loop with this game since I've quit for a while now and boy howdy what a patch to come back to. They made her more loveable than ever and I have to admit I was choking up by the end there, especially since someone told me >!that she dies for good this time. I wouldn't have even minded if it actually happened since it was so beautifully written, but am I ever grateful that I was being lied to. Oh man, the part where you reimagine your first meeting almost got me !<

Man I love this girl. I dont know what it is but whenever Mihoyo makes a death positive character it always resonates with me, the other one being Hu Tao from Genshin. I love how she's one of those meathead muscle type characters who always puts herself into dangerous situations but not because she's particularly foolish or that she's looking to die, but because she knows she has limited time on this earth so she's always ready to lay it all on the line at any moment. Its really kinda beautiful how whenever she does something where its highly likely that she dies she doesnt do it because she embraces death or that she wants to sacrifice herself for her friends, its because she's at peace that all her choices lead her to that moment, and she accepts all the outcomes. You really hear it in all her lines, and her interactions, not just the story dialogue, and it all makes the tragic events in her story and her lamentations of wanting an ordinary upbringing read as life affirming instead of depressing. I know this may be bias because of the push she had in the story but this really is how I feel about her. 

I just had to get all that out or these thoughts wouldnt leave my mind 😝. If anyones curious about my dream, >!I dreamt that she was some sort of instagram influencer and that she was my date for a relative's wedding. We stopped at a coffee place and they had this strange experimental cup where it was a big cup split into four, sealed with some sort of edible membrane, and each ""slice"" had a different flavor of coffee. In the middle was a small cup of sweets, and the idea was that youd slam all four halves together into the cup and al of it would react and mix with each other. It kinda does feel like something she'd want to try in the game lol!<

1psua95,https://i.redd.it/4k6eb8jorp8g1.png,"Always had instant coffee. Considering switching to Specialty, but is the 4x-10x cost and effort actually worth it for a Latte drinker?","Hi

I have always drank instant coffee in my life. I have coffee 3x a day and a coffee lover.

Now from reddit, I came to know about specialty coffee but my point is, does it makes sense to switch to something costs 4x to 10x?

I have drank coffees (mainly latte) in Starbucks, Blue Tokai, Airport Lounges. I have also tried those different flavours they talk but most of them, if not all, are just essences or lab-grown flavours. No real hazelnut in hazelnut coffee. Though seemingly Orange zest has real orange but I doubt if it is essence-free.

I almost exclusively drink coffee with milk. Does it make sense to buy expensive specialty beans if I'm just going to drown them in milk? Will I actually taste a difference compared to Nescafe Gold?

Also, I can make instant coffee in 30 seconds. Specialty seems to cost significantly more per cup and requires a whole brewing ritual.

1psu744,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/comments/1psu744/2025_review_pnw_globalist_edition/,2025 Review - PNW Globalist Edition,"Andaz Wailea - We all know this one is a 10/10; I could nitpick about suite/point availability, dinner options, and it feeling a bit crowded but I'd be lying if I docked a point. If you're waffling between this and the regency for Maui just spend the money to stay here unless you'll have young kids with you.

Hyatt Regency Lake Washington - 8/10; far and away the best points value in Seattle even with being a bit out of town. Exceptional for Globalist benefits and really punches above its weight for category.  I stayed here three times this year and have another booked in a few weeks. Loses points because of distance from Seattle, my husband's masseuse kinda fucked up his back once, and I hate the toiletries at regencys.

Hyatt House Portland / Beaverton - 9/10 for someone who'll have a car and kids with them. No reason to stay in Portland proper when this place is available. Loses a point because of their nonsense with parking; don't ever pay for it. Quiet, safe, updated, good service, easy MAX access (door to door hotel to zoo in under 15), some of the best food and coffee in the Portland area is very nearby. Breakfast is standard place/house stuff. Gave me globalist benefits for both my rooms. Stayed here 3x this year and will again

Thompson Seattle - 7/10; higher for award stays. The location is excellent and if you like Thompsons you'll love it. Rooms are nice but a little small. I just can't justify paying so much extra to stay here over the Regency a few blocks away.

Which brings me to...

Hyatt Regency Seattle - 10/10 my main squeeze. If you're a globalist they let you do whatever you want. Going to a mariners game and want to leave your car there 12 hours after you check out? No problem. Staff is extremely responsive on the text line. Premium suite upgrades on the reg. No club so breakfast is in the restaurant which I prefer anyway. NFL teams stay here before games; shared an elevator with Chris Godwin this year. No human feces on the sidewalks outside which you cannot say of the Grand Hyatt. Only note is that the made to order food in the market is kinda trash. Stayed here probably 6x

Suncadia Resort - 9/10 for outdoorsy folks as long as there isn't a big conference going on. I expect to be a 10/10 once the rooms are updated as long as they don't increase the price much because of it. Pay the extra for a river view and balcony. Took my kids here for a long weekend and added a night to the stay after being there for just a couple hours. No breakfast benefit is a bummer but that's affiliates for you. Restaurant is overpriced for what you get but there's good stuff in town and you get full sized fridges for groceries. 

Hyatt House Seattle Bellevue - 8/10 higher quality and more amenities than you'd expect for a Hyatt House; used to be my go-to for the Seattle area before I made Globalist and I still stay here if I'm going to be in the 405 or 90 corridors. Free and abundant parking. Nothing too remarkable but nothing disappointing.

Regency ORD - 6/10; nice enough place but WTF is that parking charge and they wouldn't let my husband check in without me even though they'd confirmed twice they would

Regency San Francisco Downtown SOMA - 7/10; I think I would rate this higher if I liked San Francisco more and wasn't only ever there for a conference I don't like going to. Regardless, it's where I always stay in SF. Club breakfast is pretty good.

Hyatt Place St. Augustine Vilano Beach - I'm giving it a 10/10 because it was so weird in an endearing way and I assume most people staying at a beach hotel will like that it's near a beach. I do not like the beach and found it hilariously Florida that my balcony room looked over a Publix instead of the ocean. Rooms were cavernous but had almost no storage for some reason. You have to use a wristband to access amenities but they only give you one so you carry it instead of wearing it. That being said I was kinda shocked at the amenities for just being a HP. Staff were so lovable. I hope I never have to come back to Florida but I'll stay here if I do.

Regency SLC - 3/10 don't @ me I absolutely hated this place. They didn't even tell me there was a club, the front desk held my food delivery hostage and lied about it, they didn't tell me that I needed to take a specific hidden elevator to get to the guest floors, the room decor was very cheap flip house-y, and I had to ask to be moved out of a mid-floor standard room with a refinery view. I shared an elevator with someone in full body paint on more than one occasion. The staff member working the WOH desk is my nemesis. Valet staff were lovely though despite constantly fighting for their lives with all the restaurant and event traffic. All in all I think this place is a lot better to visit for the restaurant or bar. Id recommend that people just stay at the Grand America.

Hyatt Vancouver Alberni - waffling between a 6/10 and a 14/10. Tl;Dr it's definitely not ready yet to be a Park Hyatt but it's so lovely anyway. It had some fixable things that might be deal breakers for luxury travelers but didn't bother me. They were so great to me and my family including treating the second room the same as mine without using a GOH. Excellent location and surprisingly reasonable price for valet parking. The massages are soooo good. So many nice little touches that add up to a fantastic experience. You do hear some road noise at night even on higher floors. Hotel rooms only go up to floor 15; everything above that is residences.  ",2,1766390988.0,hyatt,0,1.0,False

So about a month ago i met her 24F on tinder and a week later of texting we meet and have a date I pay for our coffee which she giggled and felt flattered, we talked a lot , she asked me questions , even offered to cook Korean food for me (she’s Korean living abroad), she was following me , we went to Christmas market , she was laughing many times , then we went we sat on a bench I suggested and she loved it and on that bench she started asking me questions about my last girlfriends etc and she was also saying “if I had a boyfriend I’d do this etc “ which I don’t know what she meant by that . 

Anyway she mentioned she went to clubs so I got sad / angry in a way which she noticed and she told me “ but it was only three times “ then told me she had three boyfriends in the past in Korea and asked me about my past relationships too . She also asked if I’m traditional man etc she said she is and I said I love it etc . 

It was going pretty good , I left home cause she was meeting her friend and she texted me I arrived home etc and that she also had a great time on the date as well. However , Thursday I asked her ( because she was going to morocco on Thursday for 10 days ) I asked her “ are you going to bring the Christmas gift you bought with me,  with you “ which she replied “ oh no haha too heavy “ 

However since then not one word from her on WhatsApp and I haven’t messaged her also but because I asked her a question and she only replied that she didn’t follow up with another question and I don’t want to look needy . One thing mentioning tho is that she was bad at texting also before , always only texting me to meet with time and date . But now I sit here at  home wondering if she’s not interested especially after all the green flags . What do you think it’s going on ?",1,1766390844.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

So here is the problem especially with women. Whenever I wanted to travel to a new place I searched the same thing, 'is this place safe to go'. Not the crime rates , just general safety, how safe is for women, how safe is neighborhood or transport . I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes', I wanted to see real people experiences . Safety is best if people share there experience and google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question. Yes I can ask chat gpt, but for safety real people experience matter more I suppose. People post these experience but they are lost in communities.

So, I started building a product called 'Safe or Not', a just type in the location and all stats in one place, even for streets. You can share the experience so other people can travel better.

[Safe or Not](https://www.safeornot.space/location/8aec2ad9-409b-4245-b2ae-62e8ce8a4718)

Welcome to the results of the 2025 CasualUK Census!

In November we asked you to fill out the census so we can get a better idea of who subscribes to the sub, what they like and how we can make it better. Thank you for your comments in the [original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/1ot6611/the_rcasualuk_2025_census) – they will make sure that the census at the end of 2026 is even better.

Only 2046 lovely people filled it out, which is a bit sad as we have nearly 3 million of you subscribed to the subreddit! In comparison, a huge 18,500 of you filled out the 2022 census. Ah well. It has made it much easier for me to go through the results, so I shan’t grumble too much!

To those who did fill it out - thank you for taking the time to respond, and for your thoughts on what you like about the subreddit! To those who didn’t - please imagine me blowing a raspberry at you.

Due to all the *issues* with image hosting sites at the moment, I’m experimenting with putting the images directly into the post. They should maximise if you click on them. I've done a couple of tests and for some reason, copying the pictures into the post itself makes them very blurry. They are less blurry when you click on them!



Without further ado, here are the results:

# Question 1 – How are you today?

Plenty of you were having a good day when you filled it out which is nice to see. To those who weren’t, I hope you’re doing well today! 4 of you didn’t answer at all. Should we be worried?

https://preview.redd.it/r45zt9awp48g1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=8321e64fd35f4c8d94f1058de6320cef3fd199d1

# Question 2 – How old are you?

Pretty self-explanatory! Are they odd brackets? Maybe. Do I care? No.

https://preview.redd.it/rz7j83uxp48g1.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=10a908dc0dfecab7a83f9ab110b809aa69376a8a

Time marches on relentlessly, and the older folk are slowly taking over.

# Question 3 – Which gender best describes you?

More ladies and folk identifying as non-binary compared to 2022! Of course, with a much smaller dataset it’s possible that this isn’t truly representative, but we can only use the info given to us.

https://preview.redd.it/2c1ayy88q48g1.png?width=751&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc792ff01079b4acab90268acef30597cc7cbc2d

# Question 4 – Is your gender the same as was assigned at birth?

Not a lot to say other than largely yes.

# Question 5 - What best describes your sexual orientation?

To the person who said they’re gay for the mods, call me.

A smattering of other answers:

* I live, and love (I don’t laugh though)

* Dr Pepper Sexual

* Liverpool

* Shag anything that walks

* Would never kiss or cuddle or marry anyone but I could shag a select few.

Am I disappointed that nobody took the opportunity to say that they were [bi-furious]([https://preview.redd.it/in-scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-2010-when-i-first-watched-v0-z64osyewka6e1.png?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=a71f4b6190b9070d127355ee92b0913ab9178545)? Maybe just a little.

# Question 6 – What ethnicity best describes you?

90% of respondents describe themselves as white British or white other. with a further 10% as ‘white – other’. Asian British, Asian and Black British were the next highest. Some people described their ethnicity as:

* Meat popsicle

* Mongrel

* Yellow

# Question 7 – What’s your relationship status?

A third of respondents are single in some shape or form, and over half are currently in relationships. 350 of you are single and ready to mingle. Well, if you’re interested, I know somewhere where 349 other single people may be loitering, just hoping that their witty repartee might catch your eye. (Should we do r/CasUK speed dating? …No.)

To the people who are ‘complicated’, the one who’s somehow engaged to their ex (I know you said don’t ask but I have questions) and the person who said ‘unrequited love’ – I hope you’re doing alright.

One person said they were married to England, like Elizabeth I.

# Question 8 – Where in the world are you?

For this, we’ve removed the UK responses as 92% of people who took part were from the UK and removing them from the map made it more interesting.

I will hold my hands up and admit that I somehow forgot Greenland. If there are any Greenlanders here, I’m very sorry!

5 of you found the ‘I am not from earth’ option. Well done.

# Question 9 – If you’re in the UK, what county are you in?

Unfortunately, it was prohibitively expensive to purchase a map of the UK and then map the responses so you can have a graph instead. It’ll be titchy here, but if you click on the picture it should maximise and you’ll be able to see the detail.

# Question 11 – What sector do you work in?

Should have locked the answers down on this one so you could only put in some of the defined ones, whoops. Unfortunately I’ve had to exclude unique answers to be able to make you a pretty graph, as well as excluding ‘n/a’, ‘unemployed’, ‘retired’ and ‘student’. But whoever put down that they work in winemaking… I like wine. Let’s talk.

# Question 12 – Yeah but what’s your actual job?

A word cloud! Aren’t we trendy? I am sure you’re all shocked by the prominence of ‘Software Engineer’. I’ve read through the whole list and there are some really interesting answers!

If you’re interested, [here’s a link to the write in answers for job titles]([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T3XYYWFcd8nsSWAUAhZ-iD7dGQYA5JvwelQe2Bk9A0w) if you want to see the rest. It’s in alphabetical order and is not linked to any other answers.

# Question 13 – Got any pets?

As with 2022, no pets is unfortunately top again :(

# Question 16 – What sports do you like? (Both to participate in and to watch)

Football is top of the pile, as always. F1 continues to be extremely popular (next time we’ll put ‘motorsports’ to capture other races, thanks for the suggestions).

Honourable mentions to aerial & pole, archery, curling, hurling, rowing, eSports, skateboarding, fencing, Sumo, bullriding, surfing, sailing, hiking/walking, caving, cheese rolling, and high-altitude Connect Four.

# Question 18 – Do you drink alcohol?

76% of respondents drink alcohol, a smidgen less than in 2022.

I'm afraid that I can't include a graph for this question without removing the picture of your lovely pets - I'm sure you'll agree that's fair!

# Question 19 – If you do drink alcohol, what’s your tipple of choice?

Beer way out in front again, followed by the usual suspects:

Some of you drink hand sanitiser, the blood of their enemies, jungle juice, fireball (how?!), and anything with bubbles

Several people mentioned that they have reached milestones in their sobriety – congratulations!

# Question 20 – What about hot drinks?

Coffee is king, but only just.

# Question 21 – How was 2025 for you, on a scale of 1 to 10?

1 being the lowest and 10 the highest (the standard way, surely?). The common score was 7 – same as 2022.

# Question 22 – What was your favourite post on r/CasualUK this year?

[A lot of you loved the gender affirmation from the Kebab shop](https://old.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/1k198c0/as\_a\_trans\_man\_theres\_nothing\_more\_gender/). 

Bizarrely, we had TWO posts about people digging up potential bombs in their garden - [One](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/1j7abc1/has\_dad\_dug\_up\_a\_bomb) and [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/1js0o90/what\_is\_this\_thing\_that\_i\_found\_in\_my\_garden).

[Several mentions for the skeleton who was living their best life]([https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/1nra65m/bought\_a\_skeleton\_from\_sainsburys\_i\_regret\_nothing).

[I loved this sentimental one]([https://old.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/1mznl69/now_im_a_grownup_im_realising_how_many_of_my)

And of course, how could we forget the [Beelinda saga]([https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/1lcpodm/the_final_update_about_beelinda), which inadvertently raised a huge amount of cash for the [Bumblebee Conservation Trust]([https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/1lk20dx/update_from_the_bumblebee_conservation_trust_mod)?

Many of you said that the various daily threads are your favourite - we’re so glad.

There were lots of other wonderful suggestions; [the full list is here]([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T3XYYWFcd8nsSWAUAhZ-iD7dGQYA5JvwelQe2Bk9A0w) for your perusal.

# Questions 23 and 24 – Suggestions to the Mods and Thread Ideas

As always, we’ll be taking these answers away and seeing what is in them to improve the subreddit. A follow-up post may follow.  We’ll definitely be having a refresh of the daily/weekly/monthly threads - a lot of the ideas you’ve given are actually already in place but maybe they are being overlooked.

I think this is a useful place to say that for every post of something you dislike, not only does someone else mention how they like those posts, but we probably remove and redirect 10-15 similar posts for every one we let through.

Thank you to the hundreds of kind comments about the subreddit, moderators and community. It is really appreciated. Anyone who asked us to allow ducks is lucky the census was anonymous.

Some other notable suggestions:

* Don't feed your 8 month old curry... Oh, mod advice? No idea.

* If you have hiccups, take seven quick sips of water in a row. Never fails.

* Less moderation. Let's get unhinged for a bit.

* Please destroy Catford

* That you all compete for my affections in a ""The Bachelor"" style format.

>I do want to know how mod A liquid sky managed two holidays so close together this year.

*EXTREMELY* poor planning, my friend.

# Question 24 – And finally, share a fun fact about yourself?

>Am I in a team-building exercise?

Yes. Sorry.

Some absolute corkers of fun facts. I have SO MANY QUESTIONS about some of them, I wish this hadn’t been anonymous so we could find out more... [Here’s the full list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T3XYYWFcd8nsSWAUAhZ-iD7dGQYA5JvwelQe2Bk9A0w).

And that’s a wrap! Thank you for all the posts, comments and upvotes this past year, and thank you for filling out the census if you did. You’re a good bunch most of the time.

Let us know if you find anything fun in the spreadsheets in the comments!

Im a sociable person and like to explore and do things, but not really go out partying often. I don't mind eating mostly my own cooking at home, but would like to eat out some of the local cuisine as well, like 50/50 I think. I do like shopping but not to an extreme level, and I would like to save for traveling as well, within and outside of China. I like museums, parks and historical sites, as well as coffee shops and local businesses etc.

Offer 1: Nanjing kindergarten
Pay: 23k before tax including housing allowance
School: Etonkids (I have heard some things about this school but don't know how this branch is)

Offer 2: Jinan kindergarten
Pay: ~18k before tax but three 50sm apartments to choose from
City seems beautiful

Offer 3: Tianjin kindergarten
Pay: ~18k before tax and housing
(Side note: the head teacher seems super sweet and the agent mentioned that most of the teachers he recommended the previous year renewed and were very happy with her)
City seems relatively interesting but I've heard that the people are not friendly?

Offer 4: Shanghai Jiading district
Pay : 20k before tax + housing

I'd rather even get kicked out at this point than endure another day with her. She's always yelling at me or berating me over something and then she tries to gaslight me into thinking this is just ""normal parenting"" or I'm just too sensitive when i get upset from her words or yelling. She berates me and criticises me over each and everything and tells me she's just ""training"" me for my future husband and in laws. Anyways I try to keep my room as clean as possible but she will still always find something to yell at me over and give me hard time over it to the point being at home has become living hell.

So yesterday night i cleaned up my room as much as i could except i forget one coffee cup at my bedside, so the morning after she came yelling me all over this coffee cup on my bedside shelf and gave me a huge lecture on how i will survive with my future husband or in laws being this ""messy"" all over this coffee cup as she already makes me feel like a failure for being unmarried in my late 20s as she already has established a huge main life goal for me right from the beginning and it was to get married so since i still havent accomplished this, she considers me a disappointment for it.And as i said in my previous post here, my mother yelled at me few days back over few stuff being on my wooden box so i put some of the stuff i dont use as often in another store room which included prayer mat and scarf, she saw that and got angry over me not being religious anymore. So i brought those things back into my room, so the scarf was all messed up as i put it quickly back into my room which i forget to fix, she saw that and gave me a huge lecture over how i will survive with my future husband and in laws once again being this ""disorganized"". So i got upset from all of her yelling and she yelled at me more for being too sensitive and brought up how she was able to survive her abusive mother in law. She said why am I making it a big deal from me being upset when she is the one who made it a big deal in the first place by giving me a huge lecture over it.

I just cant take it anymore, id rather die, go homeless then live another day with her cause she'll always find something to bully me or control  me over, im not allowed to get upset or else i get berated more for being too sensitive, get gaslighted into thinking this is normal parenting, i cant call her our or defend myself without her taking this as ""disrespecting"" and she'll threaten me [then.My](http://then.My) life would be so much peaceful when my pushy mother is not around and criticizing me.

I am from Hyderabad Madhapur 
I have worked a delivery boy for 3yrs.
Worked as Rapido Captain, Swiggy delivery boy, Instamart grocery delivery too. In all these I have one issue a lot. Most of the day we are on road travelling through traffic and Chaos. I always wanted a place to rest and recharge. There are none. Especially around the Madhapur, there are tea stalls but most of them don't offer proper sitting area or shade. Even if they do we don't have charging ports to charge our mobile. So I decided to start one. It's like a tea stall, we serve tea, coffee, cigarettes & snacks same price as Road side tea stall, place to sit & sip and also recharge your mobile and yourself. Free water and first aid kit will be avaliable too, Will run for 24hrs This will be near the Dark stores so it Will be easy access to Delivery boys.
Not just delivery boys for people who want to sit and talk while they drink tea or smoke also welcome.

1pstumo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1pstumo/your_website_loses_10_of_visitors_every_second_it/,Your website loses 10% of visitors every second it loads. BBC proved it. You're probably bleeding 30-50% of conversions without knowing.,"https://preview.redd.it/7its6w5zmp8g1.png?width=2816&format=png&auto=webp&s=5400a4d04dcec54d7931dd7cd8be30f84439633e

BBC ran the numbers. **10% of visitors leave per second.**

Your site takes 5 seconds? You just lost 50% of people.

They never saw your product. Never saw your pricing. Just... gone.



# The math is brutal:

**1 second load:** 3.05% conversion **5 second load:** 1.08% conversion

**Same site. 3x difference. Just speed.**

And get this - average mobile load time is **8.6 seconds.**

82.9% of your traffic is mobile.

Do the math.



# Why you don't see it:

You test on your MacBook Pro. Fast WiFi. Loads in 1 second.

Your customers? Phones. Spotty 4G. Coffee shop WiFi.

**Your experience ≠ their experience.**



# Real numbers:

**Walmart:** 1 second faster = 2% more conversions **Vodafone:** 31% faster = 8% more sales  
**PAIGE (2024):** Fixed speed = **76% conversion increase**

Not A/B tests. Real revenue.



# Test right now:

**Option 1 (30 seconds):** Go to [**pagespeed.web.dev**](http://pagespeed.web.dev) → paste URL → check mobile

* Under 50? You're fucked
* 50-90? Fixable
* 90+? You're golden

**Option 2 (5 minutes):** [FixMRR](http://fixmrr.vercel.app) checks:

* Speed (Core Web Vitals)
* What's actually slow
* Plus: value prop, CTA, trust signals, SEO

Free, no signup. Shows you exactly what's broken.

Basically: PageSpeed for speed only. FixMrr for speed + all conversion killers.



# Quick fixes (30 min, cuts load time 50%):

**Images** (biggest impact):

* Compress (TinyPNG)
* Use WebP
* Lazy load

**Scripts:**

* Defer JavaScript
* Kill unused trackers

**Server:**

* Enable compression
* Use CDN (Cloudflare free)

**WordPress?** WP Rocket automates this.



# Why this actually matters:

You spend months building features.

Craft perfect messaging.

Run ads.

Then your site takes 5 seconds to load and **half your traffic bounces before seeing any of it.**

Speed isn't a tech metric. It's a revenue metric.



# The targets:

**Mobile (83% of traffic):**

* 3s = good
* 2s = great
* 1s = top 10%

**Desktop:**

* 2s = good
* 1s = great

If you're over 5s on mobile, you're losing half your conversions. Right now. Today.



# The process:

1. **Test** (pagespeed.web.dev or [FixMRR](http://fixmrr.vercel.app))
2. **Fix images** (biggest win)
3. **Defer scripts**
4. **Enable CDN**
5. **Re-test**

Takes 30 minutes. Often doubles conversion.



**The brutal truth:**

Best product? Doesn't matter. Best pricing? Doesn't matter. Best marketing? Doesn't matter.

If your site takes 5 seconds to load, **people are gone before they see any of it.**

Fix speed first. Everything else second.



**Data:**

* BBC: 10% per second (BBC Tech Blog)
* Portent: 100M pageviews (2024)
* Mobile traffic: 82.9% (verified)
* Case studies: Walmart, Vodafone, PAIGE (2022-2024)

  
**TL;DR:** Lose 10% visitors per second load time. 1s = 3x better conversion than 5s. Average mobile: 8.6s. 83% traffic is mobile. Real companies: 8-76% conversion boost from speed. Quick wins: compress images, defer JS, CDN. Target: under 3s mobile. Test: [pagespeed.web.dev](http://pagespeed.web.dev) (speed only) or [FixMRR](http://fixmrr.vercel.app) (speed + conversion audit).

Started chatting up with a junior from his Medical College.  
This lady seemed intelligent, really good looking and confident.

Was nice she was trying to talk in broken Hindi (I am a Northie and comfortable in English and Malayalam), and I was trying to chat her up in my broken Malayalam. We also connected over shared veganism.

We eventually escaped the shaadi, for coffee, and ended up at her place. Hooking up. Felt nice. I got her flowers and wrote her a short letter.

We kept on texting as I left the town, it was amazing!  
but I noticed something subtle weird stuff happening:

* Repeated mention of her from being an adivasi community. (I do not consider it changes any feelings for me towards a person/ dating). But she kept on repeating again.
* She felt the world is extremely discriminating (I disagree somewhat) and minorities are tortured in India (I agreed)
* Everyone should be vegan, and she can not see people who eat meat in a good light (I disagree).

The last reason got to me. I asked her if she would see Muslims, minorities who eat meat in the same light? I personally feel veganism should be a choice.

This made her furious, as she felt, people should not be kept on the same pedestal due to historic discrimination (Dafuq??) and mentioned we can not date as I am discriminatory.

I did not text back after this reply.

Evelyn



""Crash!""



Porcelain exploded across the café floor, a white spray of jagged teeth.



Silence snapped into place—forks paused halfway to mouths, breath held like the room itself was afraid to move.



My fingers still hovered in the air, useless, trembling.



Perfect. Another mess. Another reminder I didn’t fit in anywhere, not even among humans pretending life was simple.



“Gray.” The manager’s voice cut like a blade. “What. Is. Wrong. With. You?”



I swallowed the answer I didn’t have. ""I'll handle it.""



Cold shards bit into my palms as I knelt, blood beading in neat red punctuation. Pain grounded me. Better that sting than the other one—the hollow ache in my chest where a wolf should have lived.



Pretend. Breathe. Don’t break here.



""Clean it up,"" he barked. ""And don't make me come back.""



I didn't look up. Didn't give them the satisfaction of watching shame bloom on my face.



Three years since exile, and still, even here, I was a ghost in my own skin.



I dumped the pieces, ripped my apron off, and walked out before the manager could spit another word at my back.



Outside, neon smeared the rain-wet street like bruises. Wind bit through my jacket. I’d survived worse. I always did. Even without a wolf.



I started for the bike, hands shoved deep in my jacket pockets, when the corner drunk stepped out and blocked my path.



""Hey there, wild girl,"" he slurred, reaching for my waist. ""Finish your shift? Let me buy you a drink.""



I stepped back, heart racing. ""Not interested.""



His fingers locked around my wrist. ""C'mon, sweetheart. I've been watching you all night. Something about you... different. Dangerous."" He leaned closer, his breath hot on my face. ""I like dangerous.""



""Let. Go."" My voice dropped an octave, unfamiliar even to myself.



""Make me,"" he taunted.



So I did. My fist slammed into his chest, sending him stumbling into a table. Glass shattered as he crashed to the ground.



""She attacked me!"" he shouted, drawing everyone's attention. ""This crazy bitch attacked me!""



People backed away. Phones rose, screens glowing as they filmed. My manager's face appeared in the doorway, pale with fury.



""Police!"" someone yelled.



Minutes later, I was shoved into the back of a squad car, the drunk grinning as though he'd already won.



The interrogation room smelled of bleach and stale coffee. I sat across from Officer Davis, my wrists rubbed raw from the cuffs.



""You're twenty-one?"" he asked for the third time.



""Yes.""



""No guardian?""



""No.""



""No family?""



""No.""



I’d told that lie so long it fit better than the truth.



The door opened. Heels clicked—sharp, expensive, final.



Victoria Gray. My mother.



She signed my release without meeting my eyes. Only when we stepped outside did she bother to look at me—and then her palm cracked across my cheek.



""Three years,"" she hissed. ""Three years of silence, and this is how you show your face again? Dragged out of a human police station like a common thug?""



I touched my cheek, stunned. ""It wasn't—""



""Don't speak."" Her eyes cut through me like blades. ""You were expelled for a reason. Don't think exile made you wiser. You're still a stain. And stains… stay hidden.""



She checked her watch, bored already. ""Your grandfather wants you home. Don't make me waste more time cleaning up your messes.""



The truth hit me. ""So that's why you're here. William sent you.""



Her expression didn't change. ""Lock yourself up tonight,"" she said. ""It's Full moon today.""



I spat a laugh, ""You know damn well my wolf left me three years ago.""



I walked back to find my Ducati. The engine snarled when I started it. I left her on the sidewalk and pushed the bike until the city lights blurred into one smear of yellow and red.



The road to the outskirts was an open throat. I ran it hard, the wind hauling at my jacket. The moon hung heavy and white above the trees.



Three years. Three years I'd endured this emptiness. Every full moon, I'd waited for my wolf to return, desperate to prove that white wolves weren't cursed like everyone believed. But every time, nothing happened.



I cranked the throttle and flew down the road, trying to outrun my own head—then I saw him.



A body on the roadside. Blood slick, moon cutting silver across his skin. Two figures with guns. Silver glinted. Hunters.



My pulse sharpened.



I should’ve driven away.



But his breath—shallow, stubborn—dragged me forward. I killed the engine, slipped into the trees.



“Who’s there?” The hunter turned. Saw me. Smiled. “You shouldn’t have seen this.”



The silver shot hissed past my ear. Instinct—not wolf, not anymore, just survival—took over. I collided with him, ripped the gun free, dropped him to the dirt.



Same shit they drilled into me on that island three years back. Kill or be killed.



Breathing hard, I turned toward the wounded man. ""You'd better be worth it,"" I muttered.



He was tall, broad-shouldered, with the kind of presence that made the air feel heavier. Definitely not human. A smell hit me—pine sap, damp earth, something alive and sharp. I pressed my fingers to his side to find the wound.



He jerked. His hand flew up and gripped my wrist.



A white-hot pulse shot through my arm, like someone had struck a match against my bone.



No.



No, no, no—



I yanked my hand back on instinct, but it was too late—my nails had cracked and split. Skin pulled tight as coarse fur burst through in a heartbeat. I was too stunned to speak.



Suddenly, the man's eyes—storm-grey despite the blood—snapped open and locked onto mine. 



His voice was barely human, scraped raw:



""Mine.""



I barely registered his words, mesmerized by the white fur erupting across my skin like wildfire.



Three years. I'd counted every single day.



Three years of being half a person, of nodding along when they said maybe it was for the best, maybe I was safer this way. Three years of biting my tongue until it bled rather than scream at the unfairness of it all.



But my wolf was stirring now, stretching like she was waking from a long sleep. And with her came the memory of who I used to be.



They were wrong about a lot of things. And I was done being their victim.

Claire's Story 1



“Pick one. The other one gets to stay and play around with us.”



The kidnapper’s gun barrel wavered between me and my husband’s childhood sweetheart, Scarlett Hayes.



And my husband, Harry Vance, he chose to take Scarlett.



A bone-deep chill gripped me. I stared at him, disbelief twisting my gut.“Harry Vance,” I choked out,“I’m your wife!”



A flicker of guilt crossed Harry’s eyes, but his resolve remained unwavering.



“Claire,” he said, his voice tight,“I owe Scarlett my life. I can’t just leave her.”



He paused, his voice softening.



“Don’t be scared,” he whispered,“even if... no matter what they do to you... I’ll still love you.”



His words were a blade, plunged deep into my chest, twisting.



“But I don’t owe her anything!” I shrieked, the words tearing from my throat.“Harry, if you walk out of here with her today, we are done! We will never get back together!”



Harry’s eyes welled, but he still stooped, carefully lifting the unconscious Scarlett into his arms.



“Don’t rush off, Mr. Vance!” A voice drawled from the shadows, thick with lewd intent.



A kidnapper let out a guttural laugh, his fingers already on his belt buckle, as he and the others started to close in.



“And the boys haven't had their fun with Mrs. Vance yet!”



The moment the warehouse door slammed shut, my world imploded.



The kidnapper ripped my shirt open, his rough palm pressing against the skin of my waist.



“Everyone says Mr. Vance worships his wife,” the kidnapper sneered, his foul breath hot on my ear.“Guess he doesn't love her that much, does he?”



I thrashed, tears blurring my vision.



Just as the kidnapper ripped my bra strap down, the warehouse door burst open—



“Police! Don't move!”



A gunshot cracked, and the kidnapper pinning me down crumpled.



I collapsed into a familiar embrace.



“It’s alright, Claire, it’s alright...” Harry’s voice trembled.“I had an ambush set up outside the whole time. You're safe...”



A glacial chill settled deep in my bones.



What did an ambush matter now?



At the edge of life and death, he had still chosen Scarlett.



“We're... over...”



With those words, I finally lost consciousness.



The next time I woke, the familiar ceiling of my bedroom greeted me.



My fingers twitched, only to find them tightly clasped.



“You're awake?” Harry instantly hunched over me, his eyes rimmed with a profound darkness.“Water? Are you hungry? I had the housekeeper make your favorite—”



“Harry.” I cut him off, my voice sharp.“Do you remember what I said when you walked away with Scarlett?”



His body went rigid.



“I want a divorce.”



My voice was frighteningly calm.



“You just woke up, you need more rest. I'll go out and get you some wontons.” Harry deliberately avoided my gaze.



“Avoiding it won't help.” I pushed myself up, each word falling heavy and deliberate.“Let's talk about the divorce.”



His back visibly stiffened, a faint tremor running through him, but he still strode quickly out of the bedroom, forgetting even his jacket.



I stared at the closed bedroom door, and a memory from five years ago suddenly surfaced.



Back then, he had just taken over Vance Corp, swamped with work every day, barely able to catch his breath. Yet he would still drive across half the city, just to bring me a bowl of hot wontons.



“Claire, open up,” he’d say, always wanting to feed me back then, his eyes so tender it almost seemed unreal.“Careful, it’s hot.”



But now, he couldn’t even bring himself to look at me.



I forced myself to sit up, opened my laptop, and began drafting the divorce papers.



Truth be told, Harry and I had been deeply in love.



So much so that when Scarlett, his childhood friend, caused a scene at the company, he could coldly tell her in front of everyone:“Scarlett, I don’t like you. Have some self-respect.”



So much so that when Scarlett purposely stumbled into his arms, he would immediately push her away and text me right after:“Claire, someone took advantage of me again. Only a kiss from my wife can make it better.”



Until that earthquake—



Scarlett risked her life to rescue him, but was crushed by a falling beam herself, breaking two ribs.



From that day on, everything changed.



“Claire, Lettie saved my life,” he’d pleaded, the first time he’d ever asked anything for Scarlett.“She just wants a job at Vance Corp...”



“Claire, Lettie’s not doing well.” He’d stood me up for Scarlett for the first time.“I’m taking her to the hospital...”



“Claire, Lettie...”



Once. Twice. Countless times.



I understood his guilt.



But when that guilt, time and again, trampled over our marriage, even my own safety—



I was exhausted.



The phone on the coffee table rang just as I slid the signed divorce papers into a file folder.



I picked it up, realizing it was Harry’s brother.



The moment I pressed answer, his voice, frantic and distorted, spilled from the speaker.



“Sister-in-law! You need to get to the Family Mausoleum! Harry made me whip him ninety-nine times to apologize to you. He’s covered in blood now, and he says he won’t get up until you forgive him...”



My lips twisted.



Harry was always like this. Every time he hurt me because of Scarlett, he’d find some even more extreme way to prove his love.



Just like last time, when he stood me up for Scarlett, only to buy an entire rose garden to apologize the next day.



Just like the time before that, he'd celebrated Scarlett's birthday, forgetting our anniversary, only to then shell out a fortune on a necklace as an apology.



Now, it was time for the lashes.



Did he truly believe a back raw and mutilated with wounds could erase the fact that in a life-or-death moment, he'd chosen her?



Did he imagine ninety-nine lash marks could possibly erase the terror of my clothes being ripped away by the kidnappers, all while he walked out, cradling Scarlett in his arms?



Did he truly believe...if only he suffered enough, I would simply melt?



But this time, I wouldn't.



Clutching the divorce papers in my hand, I grabbed my coat and walked out the door.



Inside the Family Mausoleum, Harry, still in his impeccably tailored suit, knelt before the ancestral tablets. A vast expanse of his back was a crimson mess, skin flayed open, flesh exposed, blood steadily trickling down his spine and soaking into the fabric at his waist.



When he saw me enter, the defeated, ashen light in his eyes suddenly sparked.



“Claire...” He stretched a weak hand toward me.“Please, just forgive me? I've explained everything about the kidnapping, didn't I? I would never let anything happen to you... You're the only one I've ever loved, the only one. I can't live without you...”



I slowly walked up to him, my gaze falling on the red mark near his collarbone.



“You say you only love me,” I scoffed.“Then what is this?”



Harry's face drained of color.“Lettie said she'd never given a guy a hickey before and insisted on trying it out on me. She saved my life, I couldn't refuse her...”



He fumbled for a small dagger.“Don't be angry, I'll cut this flesh right off!”



Under everyone's shocked gaze, the blade plunged into his skin without hesitation. Blood streamed down his neck, staining the collar of his white shirt crimson.



“Harry!” His guys immediately rushed forward to snatch the knife away.“Are you out of your mind?”



The Family Mausoleum erupted into chaos.



Several of his men frantically searched for a first-aid kit. Others looked at me, their eyes red-rimmed.“Claire, who in our circle doesn't know how much Harry cares for you? Last year when you were hospitalized with allergies, he stayed by your side for three days and three nights without closing his eyes...”



“Last month, you’d casually mentioned a fondness for the cherry blossoms in South End. He’d dropped millions, having twenty mature trees transplanted to his villa overnight.”



“Just forgive him, Claire. It’s nothing, a tiny mistake. Are you really trying to push him over the edge?”



A tiny mistake? Overreacting?



I laughed, the sound hollow, my eyes burning.



Harry pushed past the men, stumbling to his knees before me.



Blood had already soaked half his collar, but he seemed oblivious to the pain, just looking up at me, his voice a raw plea.“Claire, forgive me...”



I gazed down at the man I had once loved to my very core and suddenly felt utterly exhausted.



“Fine,” I said, taking a deep, shuddering breath.“I can forgive you.”



Harry’s eyes instantly brightened, a spark of hope flickering to life.



“I have my eye on a house,” I said, pulling a document from my purse.“Buy it for me, and I’ll forgive you.”



His heart soared with relief. He eagerly flipped open the document, about to read it, when his phone suddenly rang.



“Harry...” Scarlett’s tearful voice came through the receiver.“I’m running a 102-degree fever. I feel awful...”



Harry's expression tightened. Without a glance at the document's contents, he scribbled his signature, then looked up at me, his eyes pleading.



“Go,” I said, my voice level.



A visible wave of relief washed over him. He pushed to his feet, a cautious, almost disbelieving glance aimed my way.“Claire,” he asked,“you're not angry?”



I shook my head.“No,” I said, my tone even.



Only then did the tension drain from his shoulders. He strode away, his group of buddies falling in behind him.



As I watched their retreating figures, I slowly, deliberately, unfolded the document in my hand.



The words “Divorce Agreement” stared back at me, Harry's name scrawled on the signature line, still wet with ink.



My fingers ghosted over the still-wet ink. A bitter, mirthless smile touched my lips.



Harry, congratulations.



This time, you’ve pushed me out of your world with your own hands.

I’d watch a video, feel pumped for an hour, then nothing.
One night I realized the only habits I kept were the ones that didn’t ask me to decide.
Brushing teeth. Grabbing my phone. Making coffee.


So I did something stupidly small.
I put the book I wanted to read on my pillow.
Next morning I woke, blinked, and the book was literally in my face.
I read three pages before I even got out of bed. That’s it. Three pages.
But three pages two days in a row felt different from “I’ll read later.”
Same with the gym. I started sleeping in gym shorts.
No mental pep talk. No “I should.” Just one less zipper, one less choice.


What surprised me wasn’t the volume of work I did.
It was how quietly the resistance disappeared.
The habit stopped being a mountain and became a tiny step I kept tripping over — in a good way.


Later I tightened the setup:
– Water bottle by the bedside.
– Jacket hanging where I leave the house.
– The notebook open on the kitchen table so I could scribble one idea, not write a chapter.


The rule became stupidly simple: if starting feels like a thing you need to talk yourself into, make the start so small the conversation’s unnecessary.


I’m not saying it’s magic. Some mornings I still ignore the book. Some days the gym shorts stay on until noon.

I ignored the 'Red Ink' SOP, and now I can hear my Runner screaming on the 3rd floor.","Hi there. I am a SFC (Sergeant First Class) in the army, and I just changed duty stations about a month ago. I’ve been in long enough to know the drill, and I knew it was only a matter of time before my name popped up on the duty roster for Staff Duty. I just didn't think it was going to be so different from other places, but man, was I wrong...

On December 21, 2025, at 0900, I sat down at a desk that smelled like industrial floor wax and old coffee. My 24-hour shift had just started. In front of me sat the standard DA Form 1594 (Daily Staff Journal). Beside it was my ""Runner,"" a PFC (Private First Class) named Miller who was already three Monsters deep and scrolling through TikTok, the repetitive audio of some trending song grating on my nerves.

The NCO I was relieving, SSG (Staff Sergeant) Halloway, looked like he’d aged ten years since yesterday. His face was very pale, his eyes were bloodshot, and his hand shook slightly as he handed me the building keys.

""Listen,"" Halloway whispered, leaning over the desk so Miller wouldn't hear. ""The Commander's SOP is in the blue binder. Read it. Follow it. But there’s a manila folder tucked behind the printer. That’s the *actual* SOP. You don't sign for it. You don't talk about it over the radio. But if you want to be here for guard mount tomorrow morning, follow the notes in red ink.""

I laughed. I’ve been an SFC for a while, and I thought it was just a ""hazing the new guy"" thing—even for a senior NCO. But once he cleared the building, I pulled out that folder. It was a collection of loose-leaf papers, some dated back to the 1990s, some as recent as last month. The top page was dated November 2025. It simply said:

>**Rule #1: The 0100 Motorpool Check.**  
When you scan the QR code at Gate 4, the light will turn green. If the light turns blue, do not enter the lot. There is no blue LED in the scanners. If you see a blue light, it means the 'Mechanic' is under one of the LMTVs. If you hear a wrench hit the concrete, run back to the vehicle you used to drive there and don't look in the rear view mirror.

I arrived back at 2345, and the building was silent. I thought Miller was asleep in the side office, but the desk feels too empty. I just came back from the motorpool check, which I decided to knock out a bit earlier than 0100 because I wanted to get some rest later. That was my first mistake.

When I reached Gate 4, the scanner light didn't turn green. It didn't turn blue. It turned a pulsating, organic purple—a color I didn't know a light bulb could produce, nor did I recall the rules saying anything about that. The air suddenly felt thick, like the atmosphere right before a lightning strike. I didn't wait to hear a wrench. I got back into the duty van and drove, my heart hammering against my ribs in a way it hasn't since my first deployment.

I’m looking at the CCTV monitor right now. There’s someone—or something—standing in the middle of the parade field. It’s wearing the OCP uniform, but it’s standing perfectly still, like a statue. It's been there for twenty minutes. The weirdest part? The thermal camera shows the parade field is 32 degrees... but that figure is glowing white-hot, like a furnace. The heat bloom is so bright it’s blurring the digital sensor, washing out the grass around it into a stark, blinding white.

My watch just beeped. It's midnight; time for the first BN building check.

I opened the folder again to see if I missed anything about the purple light. I didn't, but I saw the note for midnight. According to the red-ink instructions, I’m supposed to skip Floor 3 entirely. The note says: **""Whatever you hear on the third floor, it’s a recording. Do not open the door.""**

But as I stood up, I heard a scream. It was muffled, coming through the air vents, vibrating the metal slats. It didn't sound like a recording. It sounded like Miller.

I looked over at the side office, hoping to see him sitting there, but his chair is empty. The pile of Monster cans is still there, and his phone is still on the desk, plugged into its charger. The screen is glowing in the dark, playing a TikTok on a loop. The same six-second audio clip is repeating over and over, but the pitch is dropping, sounding more like a distorted, guttural chant every time it restarts.

I’m an SFC. I’m supposed to look after my soldiers. That’s the oath I took. But I’m looking at that manila folder, and then at the dark stairwell leading to the third floor, wondering if ""Miller"" is really the one calling for me.

I printed out a single page from the workbook for dads, and left it on the kitchen table while he was having his morning coffee. I just told him, ""You don't have to say anything to me, but if you have a minute, I’d love to know what you’d say to this question.""

The question was: *""Is there a dream you gave up so that our family could have stability?""*

I honestly expected him to just shrug it off or say he didn't have any regrets. I went out to run some errands, and when I came back, the paper was still sitting there, but he was out in the garden. He had filled it out.

He didn't just write a sentence. He wrote a whole page in that cramped, messy handwriting of his.

I found out that my dad, the man I thought was just ""content"" with his boring routine, actually wanted to be a photojournalist. He won this scholarship to go study in another city in Romania in the late 90s. He left for only 1 week. Then, he found out my mom was pregnant with me. He sold his camera to have savings for when I was born and took the ""safe"" job at the plant three days later so the family could be safe.

He wrote at the bottom: *""I didn't lose a dream. I just chose a different one. But sometimes, when I see the light hit the trees, I still frame the shot in my head.""*

I’ve been sitting here crying for an hour. I realized that his quietness wasn't a lack of personality. It was the weight of a man who killed a version of himself so I could have a life. I would have gone my entire existence without knowing the depth of what he did for me because I was too scared to ask a real question.

If you still have your parents, please, ask them the real stuff. Don’t just talk about the weather or your job. Find out who they were before they became your parents. I found that question on that [**purpose-full.org**](http://purpose-full.org) site and it’s honestly changed how I look at him. We’re going for a walk tomorrow, and for the first time in my life, I’m not going to talk about my day. I’m going to ask him what kind of film he used to shoot with.",0,1766388219.0,AdultChildren,1,0.5,False

""It didn't seem important.""

Harley:



Morning light filters through our bedroom curtains in lazy golden stripes. I blink away sleep, finding myself in that peaceful space between dreams and reality. Beside me, Skyler breathes deeply, one arm flung across the pillow, his dark hair rumpled against the white pillowcase. There's the slight furrow between his brows that never fully relaxes, the shadow of stubble along his jaw, the barely perceptible twitch of his fingers as he dreams.



These quiet moments feel stolen. Precious.



Our bedroom tells the story of us better than words ever could. My case files are stacked neatly on my nightstand, color-coded tabs marking urgent client needs. Skyler's architectural magazines spill across his side, dog-eared pages marking inspiration for future projects. The dresser holds framed snapshots of our life together-hiking in the mountains, laughing at his cousin's wedding, my head on his shoulder at sunset by the lake. A silver ring box sits in my top drawer, waiting for the perfect moment. Four months and I'll be Harley Thompson. The name still feels strange in my mouth.



I slide from beneath the covers, careful not to disturb the mattress. Skyler shifts, reaching unconsciously for the warm space I've vacated. My heart catches at the gesture.



The hardwood floor chills my bare feet as I pad to the bathroom. I shut the door softly before flipping on the light, squinting at my reflection. My hair stands in dark waves around my face, defying gravity in ways that would fascinate physicists. I splash cold water on my face, brush my teeth, and attempt to tame the wild mass on my head into something resembling a professional social worker rather than someone who stuck their finger in an electrical socket.



Today's schedule scrolls through my mind: two home visits, a court appearance for the Johnson case, paperwork that multiplies like rabbits every time I turn my back. I apply minimal makeup, just enough to look alive under fluorescent office lighting.



When I emerge, the apartment smells like dark roast coffee with hints of chocolate and cinnamon. Skyler stands at the kitchen counter, his back to me, shoulders moving slightly as he hums something under his breath. He's pulled on sweatpants but remains shirtless, the morning light catching on the planes of his back. I allow myself a moment of appreciation before he senses my presence.



""Were you planning to wake up today, or should I have called in sick for you?"" He turns, coffee mug extended like a peace offering, his smile crinkling the corners of his eyes.



I accept the mug, inhaling the steam. ""Some of us need beauty sleep.""



""Clearly it's not working."" His eyes dance with mischief as he reaches out to tug at a particularly rebellious strand of my hair.



I swat his hand away, failing to suppress my smile. ""You're supposed to say I'm beautiful no matter what.""



""You're beautiful,"" he says, suddenly serious. His finger traces my jawline. ""Even with that impressive bird's nest situation happening up there.""



I roll my eyes, but warmth spreads through me that has nothing to do with the coffee. ""Charming.""



""It's why you agreed to marry me.""



""I agreed for the coffee. This is excellent blackmail material."" I take a deliberate sip, maintaining eye contact.



Skyler laughs, the sound filling our kitchen. ""I've created a monster.""



We move around each other-him reaching for mugs while I open the fridge, me ducking under his arm as he grabs plates from the cabinet. Three years of practice has turned us into choreographed partners, anticipating movements before they happen.



He retrieves eggs from the refrigerator as I steal a piece of bread from the toaster. Our fingers brush when I hand him the butter, a casual touch that still sends electricity through my skin.



""You have the Henderson meeting today?"" I ask, leaning against the counter.



""Nine o'clock."" He cracks eggs into a bowl. ""Dad's sending over preliminary numbers for the project.""



I nod, ignoring the slight tension in my shoulders at the mention of his father. Robert Thompson's name has that effect on me. It's always like someone's suddenly adjusted the thermostat down ten degrees.



""How about you?"" Skyler whisks the eggs, not noticing my reaction.



""Court at eleven for a custody case. Then paperwork until my eyes bleed.""



""Se-xy.""



""Social work-where the paperwork is endless and the crying happens in bathroom stalls.""



He smiles, pouring eggs into the heated pan. ""You love it.""



""I do."" It's true. Despite the bureaucracy and heartbreak, there's nothing else I'd rather do.



Skyler slides the spatula under the edges of the eggs, his movements confident and smooth. I watch those architect's hands that can sketch a building from nothing, that trace patterns on my skin in the darkness.



I set two plates on our small kitchen table. We found it at a flea market six months after moving in together. Skyler saw potential in the scratched surface and wobbly leg. I saw tetanus. But he restored it over weekends, sanding and staining until it gleamed, proving me wrong in the most beautiful way.



Morning sunlight catches on my engagement ring as I arrange silverware. The diamond isn't large-we both chose practicality over flash-but it catches fire in certain light, sending prisms dancing across our walls. Sometimes I catch Skyler watching me watch those light patterns, a small satisfied smile on his face.



""Earth to Harley."" Skyler waves the spatula. ""Where'd you go?""



I shake myself from my thoughts. ""Just thinking about how domestic we've become. Remember when we ate cereal for dinner three weeks in a row?""



""Dark times."" He slides perfectly cooked eggs onto our plates. ""My mother would have had a coronary.""



I laugh, the sound lighter than my thoughts at the mention of Eleanor Thompson. ""Your mother has opinions about everything from cereal to centerpieces.""



""True."" His smile tightens almost imperceptibly. ""But she means well.""



I don't argue the point. Morning light, coffee, and Skyler's bedhead aren't things I want tainted by thoughts of his parents' disapproval.



Instead, I rise on my tiptoes and peck him, tasting coffee and toothpaste and promises. His hands find my waist, anchoring me against him like I might float away if he lets go.



""What was that for?"" he murmurs against my mouth.



""Practice,"" I whisper back. ""For all those mornings after.""



His smile is the sun breaking through clouds. ""I like how you think, almost-Mrs. Thompson.""



The name still sounds strange, but in this moment I think I could get used to it.



I pack our lunches while Skyler plates the eggs. Muscle memory guides my hands. Turkey and provolone for him, hummus and veggies for me.



""Don't forget the mustard this time,"" Skyler says, sliding an egg onto my plate. ""I had a very dry sandwich yesterday.""



""That's because you refused to use the cafeteria condiments like a normal person."" I squeeze mustard onto his bread with exaggerated drama. ""God forbid you touch a communal dispenser.""



""Have you seen those things? Petri dishes with pumps."" He shudders dramatically. We're teasing each other, obviously.



The rain pattering against our kitchen window reminds me of another rainstorm three years ago. The cafe on Maple Street. The day everything changed.



I was drenched, my umbrella having surrendered to Chicago wind two blocks back. Water dripped from my hair onto the counter as I ordered the largest coffee possible. My social work certification exam was the next day, and I'd been studying for weeks. The cafe was packed with others seeking shelter from the downpour.



There was only one table with a single occupant-a man hunched over papers spread carefully across the surface. Dark hair falling across his forehead as he sketched something with intense focus. I hesitated, then approached.



""Mind if I sit here? It's either join you or stand in the corner like a wet potted plant.""



He looked up, hazel eyes registering surprise, then amusement. ""Be my guest. Though fair warning, these are work drawings.""



I set my coffee down carefully. ""I promise to keep my liquids to myself.""



The universe heard my lie and decided to punish it immediately. A businessman pushed past, jostling my arm. My coffee toppled in slow motion. I lunged for it, but physics had other plans.



Brown liquid spread across his papers like a flood.



""Oh my god."" Horror froze me in place. ""I'm so sorry. I'll pay for whatever these are.""



Instead of the anger I expected, he laughed. Actually laughed. ""Well, that's one way to critique my design.""



I grabbed napkins, frantically blotting the mess. ""Are these important? Please tell me they're just doodles.""



""Just preliminary sketches for a client presentation."" He helped me mop up, our hands occasionally brushing. ""Tomorrow.""



I stopped mid-blot. ""Tomorrow? As in, the thing you need for work tomorrow?""



He nodded, still unnervingly calm. ""It's fine. I have the digital files. These were just for my own reference.""



""I feel terrible."" I surveyed the soggy papers. ""At least let me buy you coffee for the rest of your natural"" I pause then add, ""and supernatural, life.""



""How about we start with one and see how it goes?"" He extended his hand. ""Skyler Thompson.""



""Harley Matthews. Professional document destroyer.""



His handshake was firm, his smile transforming his entire face. ""What brings you out in this biblical deluge, Harley Matthews?""



""Studying. Social work certification exam tomorrow."" I gestured to my soaked backpack. ""Though my notes might be swimming by now.""



""Social work?"" Interest flickered in his eyes. ""My mother always said I should have been a therapist instead of an architect. Apparently, I ask too many questions.""



""Architect? That explains the fancy drawings I just ruined.""



We talked for three hours. About his firm's focus on sustainable urban housing. About my passion for helping foster kids navigate the system. About how we both preferred breakfast for dinner and could quote entire episodes of The Office. The rain stopped. Neither of us noticed.



When we finally left, standing awkwardly outside the cafe, he asked for my number. I gave it, certain he was being polite. Then my phone chimed before I'd even reached the corner.



""Dinner tonight? I know a place that serves excellent breakfast.""



The memory dissolves as Skyler sets our plates on the kitchen table. I snap the lids onto our lunch containers and join him.



""What's on your mind?"" he asks, buttering his toast. ""You had that look.""



""Just thinking about the day we met. The great coffee flood.""



He grins. ""Best ruined presentation of my life.""



""Your client might disagree.""



""Worked out fine. They loved the revised design I stayed up all night creating."" He takes a bite of eggs. ""Though I did go through about twelve espressos to finish it.""



""My contribution to your architectural brilliance.""



We eat in comfortable silence for a moment, the rhythm of our forks against plates mixing with the rain outside.



""Henderson project's going to be challenging,"" Skyler says eventually. ""Dad's pushing for changes that will drive us over budget.""



I hear the tension in his voice. Robert Thompson isn't just Skyler's father; he's also the primary investor in several of his architectural firm's largest projects. A complicated dynamic that I've watched Skyler navigate with mixed success.



""What kind of changes?""



""Higher-end materials, more elaborate design elements."" He sighs. ""Things the client hasn't even asked for.""



""Because heaven forbid a Thompson project look merely excellent instead of extravagant."" The words slip out before I can catch them.



Skyler's mouth tightens slightly. ""He has his standards.""



""I know."" I reach for his hand. ""But it's your design. Your vision.""



""Collaborative vision,"" he corrects gently. ""That's how firms work.""



""There's collaborative and there's dictatorial. You should stand your ground if you believe in your design.""



He squeezes my fingers. ""What about you? That custody case today?""



I let him change the subject, recognizing the delicate balance we maintain around discussions of his father. ""Yeah. Mom's been in recovery for eight months. Dad's fighting it, but his new girlfriend has her own substance issues.""



""The system's going to do what's best for the kid, right?"" Skyler's faith in institutions is one of his most endearing and frustrating qualities.



I shake my head. ""The system's going to do whatever overworked case workers, underpaid judges, and overwhelmed foster families can manage. 'Best' rarely enters the equation.""



""You're making it better though."" His certainty warms me. ""One case at a time.""



""I'm trying."" I push egg around my plate. ""Sometimes it feels like bailing out the ocean with a teaspoon.""



""Teaspoons add up."" He reaches across the table to tuck a strand of hair behind my ear, his fingers lingering against my cheek. ""You're making a difference, Harl. Those kids are lucky to have you.""



This is what I love most about him; his ability to see hope where I see only challenges. To believe in both the system and in me, sometimes more than I believe in myself.



""Thanks."" I lean into his touch. ""I needed that today.""



We finish breakfast trading sections of the newspaper, commenting on headlines, reading funny bits aloud. Outside, the city wakes fully, traffic sounds increasing as morning commuters brave the rain.



Skyler stands, collecting our plates. ""I should get dressed. Henderson meeting won't wait.""



I rise as well, catching his wrist before he turns away. ""Hey. You're brilliant. Don't let your dad make you doubt that.""



Gratitude mixed with resignation flickers across his face. I understand then that he's already conceded whatever battle awaits him with his father. The realization settles uncomfortably in my chest.



I straighten his collar, though he hasn't dressed for work yet. A symbolic gesture of support. ""Knock 'em dead.""



""Planning to."" He pecks my forehead. ""Even the dragon.""



By dragon, we both know he means Robert Thompson. The name hangs between us, unspoken but present. Skyler disappears down the hallway to shower, and I'm left with dirty dishes and a nagging worry that some dragons can't be slain, only appeased.



And appeasement always comes at a cost.



\*\*\*



Warm soapy water fills the sink. The shower hisses to life, and I use the moment of privacy to call my dad. His voice fills the kitchen after two rings, gruff and familiar as worn leather. I tuck the phone between my ear and shoulder, hands deep in dishwater, and feel myself smile despite the lingering unease from our breakfast conversation.



""There's my girl,"" Dad says. ""Caught you before work?""



""Just cleaning up breakfast."" I scrub at egg residue on Skyler's plate. ""Court day, so I'm moving slow.""



""The Johnson case?"" His memory for my work details always touches me. Former construction foreman Jake Matthews might look rough around the edges, but he listens better than most trained therapists.



""Yeah. Mom's making progress, but these cases are never straightforward.""



""Like that Sullivan situation last year."" He chuckles. ""You were ready to adopt those kids yourself.""



""Still might have if their aunt hadn't stepped up."" I rinse a mug, watching coffee remains swirl down the drain. ""How's Carol?""



""Repainting the guest room. Again."" The affectionate exasperation in his voice makes me smile. My stepmom's perpetual home improvement projects drive him crazy in ways he secretly loves. ""Says the last color wasn't 'welcoming enough' for when you visit this weekend.""



""We're still coming,"" I confirm. ""Skyler requested Saturday off weeks ago.""



""Good, because Carol's already planning the menu."" A pause, then his tone shifts to mock seriousness. ""So have you picked out the flowers yet, or are you still pretending you don't care about that stuff?""



I laugh, the sound echoing in our empty kitchen. ""Dad, the wedding's still four months away.""



""Which according to your sister, you're practically walking down the aisle undressed with no plan."" He mimics Lily's dramatic tone perfectly. ""Apparently these things require CIA-level strategy.""



""Lily would know. She's changed her hypothetical wedding plans six times since high school, and she's not even dating anyone.""



""Your sister contains multitudes,"" Dad says gravely. ""Most of them loud.""



I set a clean plate in the drying rack. ""We'll figure out flowers this weekend if it'll make you both happy.""



""And the menu? Carol's got suggestions.""



""I'm sure she does."" I smile, picturing my stepmom with her ever-present notebook of ideas. ""We'll discuss everything when we're there, I promise.""



""Good."" He clears his throat in that way that signals a subject change. ""Your mom called yesterday. Wants to know if she can bring that guy she's seeing to the wedding.""



I sigh. ""Kevin? They've been together like, what, three weeks?""



""Four, apparently. That's practically common-law marriage in Maria-land.""



My mother's revolving door of relationships has been a constant since she left when I was twelve. Dad never speaks ill of her, a kindness I've tried to emulate.



""Tell her it's fine. At this rate, we'll have more guests than venue capacity.""



""Speaking of guests,"" Dad says casually, ""are Skyler's parents joining any of these planning sessions? Carol mentioned inviting them for dinner sometime.""



My shoulders instantly tense. The plate I'm rinsing slips from my fingers, clattering against the sink basin. A familiar knot forms in my stomach at the mere mention of Robert and Eleanor Thompson.



""They're... busy."" The words taste false even as I say them. ""Robert's company is in the middle of some big project, and Eleanor has her charity commitments.""



The truth is more complicated. The Thompsons have made their disapproval clear since Skyler brought me home. I wasn't Amanda-Skyler's ex-fiancee and their handpicked future daughter-in-law. I didn't attend the right schools, move in the right circles, or have the right family connections. Every interaction since has been an exercise in polite disdain.



""Right."" Dad's tone tells me he hears what I'm not saying. ""Well, the invitation stands. Might be good to break bread together before the wedding.""



The thought of my down-to-earth father and label-conscious Eleanor Thompson discussing centerpieces makes me wince. ""I'll mention it to Skyler.""



Another lie. Some battles aren't worth fighting at 7:30 in the morning.



""You okay, Harley?"" Dad's voice softens. ""You know you can talk to me about anything.""



For a moment, I consider telling him everything-how Eleanor suggested a different engagement ring when she saw mine, how Robert calls Skyler daily with ""career advice"" that sounds suspiciously like control, how family dinners leave me feeling two inches tall through no words said directly to me.



Instead, I say, ""Just nervous about court. The Johnson case is complicated.""



""You'll handle it,"" he says with complete confidence. ""Those kids are lucky to have you fighting for them.""



""Thanks, Dad.""



""Call me after court? Let me know how it goes?""



""Will do."" The shower shuts off down the hall. ""I should finish up here. Skyler's almost ready to leave.""



""Give him my best. See you Saturday.""



""Love you,"" I say.



""Love you more, kiddo.""



I end the call just as Skyler emerges from the bedroom, hair damp and perfectly styled, wearing the charcoal suit that makes him look like he stepped off a magazine cover. The transformation from sleepy, bedheaded man to polished professional still fascinates me after three years.



""Was that your dad?"" he asks, adjusting his blue tie-the one I gave him last Christmas.



""Yeah. Confirming this weekend."" I dry my hands on a dish towel. ""Carol's repainting the guest room again.""



""Seafoam green lasted longer than I expected."" Skyler grins, checking his watch. It's a graduation gift from his father.



""Apparently it wasn't 'welcoming' enough."" I make air quotes. ""Also, Lily's having a meltdown about our lack of flower arrangements.""



""Your sister does love a good wedding panic."" He gathers his portfolio and keys. ""We should probably start making some decisions, though.""



""This weekend,"" I promise. ""We'll make lists and everything.""



He glances at his watch again. ""I should head out. Traffic's going to be brutal with this rain.""



""The Henderson dragon awaits.""



A shadow crosses his face. ""Along with the bigger dragon breathing down his neck.""



Robert. Always Robert.



I step closer, straightening his already-perfect tie. ""You'll be brilliant.""



""From your lips to my father's ears."" His smile doesn't quite reach his eyes.



I rise on tiptoes to peck him, lingering a moment longer than our usual morning goodbye. His arms encircle my waist, drawing me against him like he's memorizing the feeling.



""I'll pick up dinner on my way home,"" he murmurs against my lips. ""That Thai place you like?""



""Perfect.""



He pecks me once more, then releases me reluctantly. ""Good luck in court. Text me when you're done?""



""Always do."" I follow him to the door, leaning against the frame as he steps into the hallway.



Skyler turns back, his expression softening. ""I love you, Harley Matthews. Even with questionable hair.""



I touch my still-unruly waves and laugh. ""I love you too, Skyler Thompson. Even with your dragon problems.""



His smile is genuine this time. He walks backward a few steps, maintaining eye contact until he has to turn toward the elevator.



I watch him go, warmth spreading through my chest despite the morning's undercurrents of tension. In moments like this-simple goodbyes laden with inside jokes and casual affection-I remember why I said yes when he proposed. Why I'm willing to navigate the complicated landscape of his family's disapproval.



Some things are worth fighting dragons for.



I close the door softly, leaning my forehead against the cool wood. Four months until I officially become a Thompson. The thought brings both joy and a flicker of apprehension. I push away from the door and head to the bedroom to finish getting ready, leaving the dishes half-done in the sink.



Dragons can wait. Today, I have children to fight for.

1pstf8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pstf8l/never_got_over_an_ex/,Never got over an ex.,"This post is not me trying to ""show off"" the fact that I've had countless women in my life. It's just void in my heart that I guess I feel alright about writing to strangers on here. I guess in a way, it helps me let it out of my system. Although if I could flip a switch whereby I NEVER meet her, I would do it. If I knew the end result of that ordeal, I wouldn't dare take the bait regardless of how love songs try to make it seem. 

In my early days of middle school and most of high school, I was a shy person. Something happened right around 11th grade where I had a complete shift in personality. I went from not being able to confess a crush on a girl, to just talking to any attractive one I found, anywhere. School, Library, Coffee Shop, done. This was a couple years ago, before things got to how they are now: scary. I don't care how much game one person has, one tiktok validation trap can ruin you, so nowadays I wouldn't do half the stuff I used to do at some point. 5-8 years ago, it was different. 

I don't really know, for a guy like me, it came to pass that at any given time, I would be talking to at least 3-4 girls. Maybe I would still be doing that right now, if I wasn't busy with work and pursuing my masters, doing one of my most difficult classes right now: ML Specialty (AWS). If I didn't have the pictures, videos, and old conversations, even I couldn't believe the number of partners I've had. When I was younger I always used to hear older guys talk about girls as if they were some kind of untouchables or something, you had to be xyz to 'get this girl' or have a chance with this one or that one etc, so as a little kid I was falsely in that delusion too. After high school, things changed for me. Despite the fact that I've never drank or smoked in my life, somehow I managed to be a social butterfly. I managed to be fully myself, sober, while other people need some sort of stimulant in order to get that level of energy. For other guys it was: ""Bro go talk to that girl"" ""I can't man, I need a couple drinks in me first."" For me, I never understood that limitation. In my player days, the only rule I had was to never approach a drunk girl. That's it, everyone else was open field. Again, this is not me comparing dick sizes, but trying to build context. 

I have had 4 what I call actual relationships. Beyond that, most of the women in my life have all been random chance, random meets, just random anomalies in general. Since I'm anonymous, I'm not ashamed to admit that I even met a married woman at Six Flags....one thing let another, and we found ourselves doing the deed in her car. Anyways, during my first relationship, I actively, routinely cheated on my first girlfriend. Not because I actively pursued it or wanted to, but that chance enabled it.... I don't know else to say it: I just never said no to any opportunity. I met my second one while I was still in a relationship with the first. I never actually ""broke up"" with my first ex. I kind of just.... Disappeared on her, until she found our months later that I was elsewhere, in a different relationship. The new one I was in a relationship with, was the time when I went to six flags one day with my older brother, and that chance encounter happened (I cheated on my second girlfriend with the married woman I met at six flags)... I don't recall if that was the only time or there were more times I cheated on my second girlfriend. But the crazy part is this: I loved my second girlfriend. If she told me to take a bullet for her, I probably would have. I was head over heels. I suppose sleeping around didn't really phase me in my personal conviction. It came to pass that through a job situation, I had to be away from her and maintain a long distance relationship. It was that long distance that ultimately ended my relationship. She was talking to someone else, closer. A shoulder to cry on, and pour her then loneliness into. 

That relationship end it then. But my desire to replace the exact HER led me to bunny hop into different relationships. 2 main ones that were rebounds.... and then 1 after I was a little healrd, so a total of 3 relationships after that. In that third rebound, I figured I was unhappy because I was chasing HER in every other girl, so I went for someone that was the exact opposite of her. Needless to say, I traumatized myself there too.

After that, another one showed up... And and then another one. I don't know how many I have been with in my life, but that number is definitely over 50... Sometimes, I day dream about a reality where I didn't become the monster I used to loath as a kid. I envision a reality where I was pure, innocent, and had 1 woman that I could have a kid with, and build a healthy life with....But in this reality, I am 3 classes away from graduation with my Masters. I have money. I have a nice car... I have a good body. But my trust, moral barometer, healthy outlook for love, etc, is just broken, damaged beyond repair. The sad part is, that I am so good and fatherly with kids, and may never get my own. If Karma ever bites my ass harder than the fact that I lost the love of my life, I could be much worst. 

The internet sells promiscuity as a trophy. But I found that trophy, and it's fragile and useless. Not to mention the close calls with STDs. You never know where ""these people"" (myself included) have been. Nowadays, before I even talk to a woman I find attractive, I make a mental note of all the possible trauma, drama, and baggage I will have to deal with, why? Because I have a lot of them, and in that analysis, I decide that the equation is not worth solving, and I just walk away. I would trade it all for a wife I could trust, and a kid I could guarantee is my own, but for now, I look up at the sky and recognize where I went wrong, and hopefully one day I will heal and fill that void. 

Edit: I guess there is no ""void"" to fill. The bottom line is that I had a good girl. But I went astray. Or I suppose I already was astray, smh. Maybe the universe sent me that good girl as a punishment. I've had it all, but the way she used to curl her toes when she used to get excited or abnoxious about something, still haunts me to this day. That smile, oh man, her smile was a bullet I would take any day. I still hear her laughter in my head. I could still hear the way she used to pronounce my name. I could still feel her sitting on her side of the bed, admiring me as I slept. Damn it. ",1,1766388009.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Bella



Three days before the wedding, I went to try on my gown. It was a white dress with an elaborate design with lots of laces and tulle on the skirt. As the seamstress pinned the sides and adjusted the length, I looked in the mirror and felt excited. I wanted to show it to Craig, and see his face light up when he saw it. There was nothing I didn’t share with him.



Lucy, my stepmother, looked me over and smiled thinly. “You look good, Bella,” she said quietly.



“Thanks mom!” I replied. “Can I show this to Craig?”



She shook her head. “No, we follow the rules. It's a bad omen for the bride and groom to meet so close to the wedding.”



“Please mom,” I whined. “I won’t show it on me. Just the dress in the box. He’ll be so happy. It’s only bad to meet the day before,” I added. “Not three days before.”



“It’s bad,” she said firmly. “You will see him at the rehearsal dinner tomorrow with everyone. And that’s it!”



I didn’t want to argue because Lucy was pretty stubborn usually. I sighed and nodded. “Okay…”



But the excitement stayed with me. It felt like bubbles in my chest. After the fitting, I held the garment bag and thought about Craig’s smile. I told myself I would be quick. I would show him the dress, still in the bag, then come right back fast. Lucy wouldn’t even come to know.



I fell for Craig when I was a sophomore in college. He was a senior. He helped me carry books on a rainy day and walked me to the parking lot. We started texting, then going for coffee. He asked about my classes and remembered small things. I liked that, and over time I started to love him.



After college, he kept seeing me. We met each other’s families. My father, Jared Williams, ran a fashion house, so there were events and shows. Craig came with me, smiled for photos, and held my hand. He was the only heir of his parents with two hotels.



The night he proposed, we were on the terrace of his parents’ hotel. There were lights and music. He went down on one knee with a ring. I was so thrilled that I said yes right away. We fixed a wedding date with our families. We booked the hall, picked flowers, and chose the cake. I kept a list for everything, doing things personally even though my father had a fleet of personnel to work for me.



As soon as Lucy left our wedding boutique, I snuck out. I put the gown in my car and drove to Craig’s apartment. I had a key he gave me months ago. He had said, “Use it when you want to surprise me.” I smiled at the memory. The building had a private elevator. I rode up and stepped into his foyer.



The living room was quiet. I set the garment bag on the sofa and called out softly, “Craig?” There was no answer. His shoes were by the door, and his jacket was on a chair. He had to be home.



I walked down the hall toward the bedroom. As I got closer, I saw a trail of clothes on the floor. A red lace top, a silk skirt, bra and panties, and a pair of heels tipped on their sides. I stopped and blinked. It looked like someone undressed in a hurry. I smiled to myself. “Must be Evan,” I whispered. Craig’s younger cousin liked to drop by without warning with a date. I rolled my eyes and decided to leave. I picked up the garment bag and turned to go when I heard a soft sound. It was a low breathy moan from Craig’s bedroom. Feeling embarrassed, I increased my pace. But froze the next moment when a man’s voice came through the door, rough and loud. “Mayaaaa!”



Shock rippled through me and I stopped moving. Was that Craig’s voice? No, God, no. My first thought was that I misheard. My stepsister, Maya, hadn’t come back to the city in four years. She never showed her face to us even once ever since she left after that fight. I turned over my shoulder to look at the half-closed bedroom door. Despite myself, I turned back. I reached and saw that the door was slightly open. The room was dim, but I could see enough.



Craig was in bed with a woman. Her long brown hair fell across the pillow. He was holding her, naked, and moving inside her. He said her name again, “Oh, Maya!”



Everything in me went quiet as my mind numbed in shock. I stood there for a few seconds, my hands turning clammy, my heart thundering. Craig and Maya together? When did this happen? I had read about this happening in books. You know, just fiction. But this cliché happened in real life as well?



The world tilted so fast I felt dizzy. I slapped my hand on my mouth to stop the sound of my gasp. My mind clicked through little details when I turned around. I noticed a glass of water on the nightstand was half full. There was a smudge of lipstick on the rim. There was a small backpack in the corner with a labubu doll, which was Maya’s. I stepped back, the hallway suddenly too long, the air too thin. I couldn’t breathe.



Unable to process the shock, I turned and went back to the living room. I picked up the garment bag with both hands, opened the door, and walked out.



Inside the elevator, I looked at the reflection of my 23 year old self. Through my pale face, my green eyes stared at me, my blond hair sticking to my face, which was covered with sweat. It was then that I broke down. A sob tore from me making my body shudder. The betrayal was too much to bear. But anger also surged through me, and suddenly I wanted to confront them. How could they do this to me?



So without thinking twice, I went back to his apartment to confront them.



A Video

Bella



I stood in the hallway and tried to breathe, wondering what I was doing? Should I go in? My confidence wavered.



But I wanted to open the door and shout at them, make them face me. I wanted to ask why, since when, and how could they betray me. I wanted to look at Maya and say, “You stole my fiancé.”



My steps faltered because I also knew how Maya was. She would deny everything in front of our father. She would say I was jealous and that I was lying. Just like last time. She would cry like she had done before. Just before leaving home, she played a victim card, making me look like the villain of her life.



But I wanted to ask Craig if any of the last five years meant anything. Gathering courage and wiping my tears, I walked into the apartment.



Just as I reached outside the bedroom, I heard Maya’s soft and smug voice. She said, “You’ve kept it a secret for four years. I’m so proud of you, Craig. You’re awesome! I only wanted to finish college and then marry you. I couldn’t bear to see my stepsister have your kids.”



Craig laughed. “Bella’s a moron,” he said. “She’s so blind in love with me she never notices anything. It was easy to manipulate her.”



Manipulate me? I stood still and held my breath, my tears silently slipping from my eyes once again.



Maya chuckled and spoke again in a sultry voice, “I’m waiting for your divorce. Then we can start our own business. I’ve been dreaming about it for so long!”



Craig sounded pleased. “Of course, love. I’ll divorce Bella in a month. After the wedding, she gets her twenty-million inheritance. And if she divorces within six months, the money goes to her husband. That’s what her grandfather wrote in his will. So, it will all come to us, baby. I only have to tolerate her for a month more.”



I pressed my palm to the wall because I felt like I might fall. My heart pounded in my ears. I knew about my inheritance. Everyone in the family knew that I would get it after marriage and lose it if I divorced within six months.



Maya chuckled. “You're smart, Craig Jones. Gosh, I hate seeing her face. She walks around the house like she owns everything. The bitch doesn’t know how fast her world is going to crumble. Then I will exact my revenge. After she loses her inheritance, her father will remove her from his will also,” she snickered.



Craig laughed hard. “You’re wicked, Maya. Just be patient for a few more weeks, baby. Then we will have it all!”



They had planned my downfall carefully for so long. If I confronted them, it would be the most foolish thing to do.



“Come, ride me, baby!” Craig said. “Let’s celebrate!”



Anger inside me erupted like a volcano. Celebrate my downfall? I wanted to teach them a lesson now. So I took out my phone, and started recording them. If I sent this video to my father, I was sure he would call off the marriage.



“Oh baby, you’re so good!” Craig said as Maya moved on him.



My hand shook so hard in anger that a few seconds later, my phone slipped down. Craig snapped his head toward me. “Bella!” he gasped, his eyes going wide.



Maya also turned sharply to see me, and her mouth dropped open. “Shit!”



I picked up the phone and rushed out.



Craig removed Maya from him and came after me. “Bella, Bella!”



“I don’t want to hear a thing from you!” I shouted, as I scrambled to send the video to Daddy.



“Stop!” he shouted. “Don’t!”



I opened the door. “You both deserve to be exposed!”



“Stop this bullshit, Bella!” he roared. “No one will marry you except me! Your marriage with me is written in stone!”



“I’d rather die than marry you, cheater!” I shouted back through my tears. I pressed the button to send the video to my father.



Craig came after me. But I was out of the door by then. He stood naked on the door of his apartment, watching me leave. “Bellaaaa!” he roared. A few people came out of their apartments hearing the commotion. Good. They would see him naked, dripping in her juices.



I left the apartment building as fast as I could, and went to my car. On the road, the city lights blurred a little. I blinked, trying to clear my vision. My mind played back the words I had just heard. ‘It was a secret for five years’. ‘Divorce in a month’. ‘Twenty million inheritance gone’. ‘Tolerate her for a month more’. ‘I rubbed my chest as the betrayal hurt deep’.



I gripped the steering wheel. I thought about Lucy and her firmly denying me to meet Craig. Did she know? Was she helping them keep me away so I would not see anything? So that their plan was executed smoothly?



Then I thought about my father. If I called him now and told him what I saw, what I heard, would he believe me? No, he wouldn’t. That’s why I sent the video proof. He loved me, but he thought I was an “entitled brat.”



If I hadn’t recorded them in the act, Maya would lie through her teeth in front of him just to get the money. I didn’t trust Craig either. He would rather watch me suffer and make the marriage more miserable.



I remembered how four years ago, after high school, Maya left the house after a fight. She told everyone I was the reason. The house was full of tension for weeks. My father chose to calm Lucy and Maya instead of me. But despite his efforts, Maya left never to return. Since then, Daddy treated me like I might start another problem at any moment. He watched me like I was a risk to manage. He scolded me often because of Maya.



I remembered that fight like it happened yesterday. Maya had cried so much that day, her sobs filled every corner of the house. She stood in front of my father and her mother, acting like she was the victim. She said she would always be a stepsister and that I could never accept her. Then, with a trembling voice, she offered to leave the house so I could live “comfortably.” Lucy’s eyes had filled with tears, but she didn’t protest. She only lowered her head and suffered quietly, as if Maya’s sacrifice was breaking her heart.



But the truth was different. The fight started because on the last day of our school, I had caught Maya with Luke. I had confessed to her a week before that I liked Luke.



I had seen her sitting close to him, cuddling him, kissing him on his lips. When I confronted her later, she smiled in a way she wasn’t ashamed. On the contrary, she flaunted her “victory”. “He never liked you!” she had said, flicking her hair.



The betrayal from Luke was nothing compared to the one from Maya. “You can have him,” I replied.



I stifled my feelings for Luke right after so that Maya could be with him. But I don’t know why Maya came home and created the drama, accusing me of just the opposite? She told our parents that it was me who kissed her boyfriend, Luke, and I hated her for being happy. My father believed her and scolded me to be more adjusting. But Maya left for college nonetheless, trapping me into guilt all this while.

Excerpts from [“Christmas: Gospel Proclaims Event”](https://coolwisdombooks.com/neville/neville-goddard-lectures-christmas-gospel-proclaims-event/)

""Tonight, those who are preparing for the great event and will sing their heads off on Christmas morning—and I’m all for it, let them have fun—but they’re talking about someone that they do not know. They will sing their hearts out with all the hallelujahs thinking some being in time and space is responding to their adulation. That’s not Christmas! In the world, moving among them walk those who have experienced the event, and they know that Jesus is Lord. But they know that Jesus is their own wonderful I-am-ness and there is no other Jesus. That Jesus is the Lord God Jehovah, and the Lord God Jehovah is your own wonderful I AM and there is no other Jehovah. “Say unto the people of Israel, I AM has sent you. This is my name forever, and thus shall I be remembered throughout all generations.” There is no other Jehovah.""

...

""Eternity waits and it doesn’t matter how long it takes, everyone eventually will come into it. But no one will come into it until he hungers, until he thirsts after God, a thirst that only an experience of God can satisfy. He said, “I will send a hunger upon the world. It will not be a hunger for bread, nor a thirst for water, but for the hearing of the word of God”""

...

""He may go to church because it pleases his family, or she may go because it pleases her family, and they go there through habit. It becomes a habit. People get up in the morning and they have a cup of coffee. One day they’ll stop drinking a cup of coffee and they’ll not miss it; and after awhile they don’t even want coffee, you couldn’t give it to them. Yet, through habit we take coffee or we take a cigarette or we take a drink, and we’re creatures of habit. So the day will come that you will really deliberately seek God, not because someone told you about it, but you’ll become hungry for an experience of God. And then you’ll be fulfilling scripture. “I will send a famine upon the world. It will not be a hunger for bread or a thirst for water, but for hearing—with understanding—the word.""

...

""I only recall my mother as a grown lady, and yet I was the fourth of a very large family. When mother bore me she could not have been more than twenty-one or twenty-two. I recall many things vividly at the age of three and four, and yet I can’t recall my mother save as matured lady. And yet she was a young girl when I was a little boy. I must have been, say, seven before she turned thirty and yet she was always a matured lady, and to me, naturally, I would call it old. Now today they trust no one over thirty. Take off their beards and you will see they themselves are well over thirty, many of them. But they can’t believe that they will ever reach a matured age…they are forever the adolescent.""

I (20F) constantly feel down about the life that is offered. I know there is a lot to do in life, travel, explore, etc. But it doesnt seem like enough. I overthink a lot, and when I think sometimes about travelling, finding new people, and all of that, it seems like fun but something ill get bored of quickly. And no, I'm not saying it in the sense of ""I want to settle down"", thats the LAST thing I wanna do. I just think like, why isnt there more? More that I can look forward to? 

I genuinely dont know if this makes sense, because even as I am writing it, it doesnt feel like I'm saying exactly how i feel, but I dont know how. It just feels so small, everything feels too small. I don't know. I just feel like I want to KEEP doing things. Not just do something for a while, get the experience, then go to a monotone life. I want to keep having new experiences. But it just seems like there isnt that much to experience. 

Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm just speaking from a place of inexperience and confusion.

I just want to do so much in my life. I want to get on a ship and sail through rocky waters. I want to climb a mountain and scale down the other side. I want to go to balls and parties and find people who have different outlooks on life. I want to be part of play that keeps travelling every week to be on new stages and entertain. I want to open a cafe that is also library on the upper floor, and when me and my best friend closes it in the evening we go to the terrace and drink coffee while looking out into city. I want so much, and I hate that I probably wont be able to experience all of this in one life.

A lot to read but have nobody to talk to or VENT,"So, I'm a 27f, I'm the youngest of 3 daughters, I have reached hard times, lost my last apartment  Due to like major depression, ADHD, this was a hole so deep that I could barely work or take care of myself, stayed in bed and wanted to die, pretty much. I stay with my 71y.o father now.  Have for the last 3 years and have been taking on the role of caregiver, cooking, cleaning, making appointments, taking him to appointments, spending time with him and doing more as he ages. Reminding him to call his other daughters, trying to encourage him to see them more. My eldest sister is 6 years older than me, has 6 kids,  works full time from home, husband does a PT driving, they live 5 minutes away. Second eldest is 2.5 years older than me, has a live in boyfriend, lives 3 hours away, she moved closer from living out of state (1000 miles away) about 2 years ago. She had a room for him, but despite telling her he's see her on some weekends and stay with her, he refuses so she got a roommate taking his room. 

So, essentially I am my father's unofficial caregiver and I have reached a breaking point. I'm pretty sure I'm burnt out to the point that me moving away is the best thing for both him and I. I feel so guilty because I don't joke with him, I don't really talk to him that much, don't bond, we'll do stuff together but its like, let's go get ice cream or something sweet. Coffee in the morning. But I can't be goofy with him, I try to have conversations with him or ask for advice but it's very stale, a lot of idk how to help, or a lot of idk in general. Which I get it, elder parent your ability kind of goes down but its weird in the first place because we never really took the time to talk I guess. 
I was my mom's therapist and emotional crutch when I was 11 because she was in an abusive marriage right after divorcing my dad. She says it's because she believed he was touching us, but my mom was batshit fucking insane when I was growing up so I'm not sure if she was telling the truth or not. Sometimes I believe it, other times I just don't want to think about it. 
I helped my sister with her 3 oldest from 16- 19, the men that I've gotten involved with I unintentionally ended up doing the emotional labor, money, last year dad and I lived with an ex of mine and we were supposed to split rent 3 ways with my dad and my ex stopped working, wouldn't cook for himself, didn't clean, was just a lump of depression and played on his xbox all the time so I took on a mom role with him even after we broke up plus doing the cooking and cleaning for dad. This relationship ended with him attacking me and my dad and I getting arrested because dad tried to get him off me and I left a mark on him and so when I called the cops, they thought we ganged up on him. My dad thinks this was funny, I do not. Stress. 

My main issue right now is living with my dad, for the last year I've been snappy and overwhelmed with pretty much everything I think. I've tried getting therapy but scheduling and money have been an issue. I feel really guilty because I keep telling myself I need to be patient with him but he's been steadily deteriorating in cognition over the last two years, all he does is sit on the couch and watch TV now. He chain smokes cigarettes, ashes on the bathroom floor, I step in snot/snot puddles on the floor at night at least 3x a week, he doesn't flush, he doesn't clean. If I'm taking a shower or using the bathroom and don't let him know first he will 100% piss in the sink. At night he uses the bathroom with the door open and he walks out of his room naked so I've been flashed so many times. 
 His balance is so bad, he stumbles and won't use a cane, I tell him he needs to do some of the stuff he had his patients do because he used to be a PT but he won't walk further than 100 feet from home, to car, to gas station for cigarettes, or I make him go to the store so he gets some walking in. 

Essentially I get irritated over the TV volume, the way he started smoking 100s and when he eats he chokes on mucus because the cigarettes are causing over production. I tell him to blow his nose, chew more, pay attention eating so he won't choke. I have to remind him over and over to flush, if I'm at work and get home late he won't eat until I'm home sosometimes he goes without eating and I feel guilty and I have to tell him to eat without me because he actually IS capable of getting food, he just doesn't do shit that I could be doing for him. His sisters tell me often that he's always liked being taken care of so even if I do ask him to help around the house or do more for himself he just won't. I'm not sure what he's actually capable of and what he's not because of this shit ngl. 

He makes me uncomfortable because we never really been close, I was the kid that learned how to stay quiet as a kid and teenager, my dad stayed on his world of warcraft, we never really bonded imo. He was 44 when I was born, I wasn't really wanted and that kind of spilled over into youre my dad and im your kid  but we're just there out of blood ties. And he's full 100% family is everything, I used to be when I was younger but now I want to kind of cut everyone off. But I'm stuck. 
I find sexual jokes inappropriate and don't want to hear it from my dad. But he's made comments about an old poly relationship I've had asking about our sex, he's made a comment about my eldest sister and an ex of hers relating to a scene in queen of the damned, he'll check out any woman, I've yelled at him over looking at teenagers asses a lot. He won't respect the fact I don't want to watch hbo porn shows with him but he will marathon them, i.e game of thrones types, I don't feel comfortable wearing shorts or no bra around him, he'll ask for help with something on his phone and multiple times I've opened it to Daddy, step daughter porn etc. and just that alone, eugh. 

This year in the beginning of it I was in a short term relationship in which lasted 3 months in person then the guy went back home in what I was told to visit his friend but he ended up staying there. There was 4 months of being lied to and 'cheated"" on in which he kept telling me he was dealing with stuff because he got involved in something he used to be involved in, and I knew he was lying but I'm so starved for love I ignored myself and ended up finding out the truth by the girl he cheated with. That pretty much fried my nervous system and I have been dealing with the kind of depression where I have a hard time doing dishes and cooking bathing even, brushing my teeth again. Genuinely have been considering harming myself( not ATM, but yanno.) the same kind of depression that led me to living with dad in the first place. 
It's been hard to keep a job so I've been stressing out about paying rent and utilities, mind you I just ask my dad for 300 a month while I'm generally responsible for 1100 all together. 

Last year around August my sister that lives 3 hours away and I had an agreement that dad would stay with her for 6 months and then he'd stay with me 6 months. He agreed, she agreed, so when the legal stuff happened he went with her and then he came back to the apartment we share after 4 months because he said he didn't like her boyfriend and she was mean. Well, I asked for the 6 months because I was already burnt out and didn't like living with him mainly because we never really got along in my adult life in the first place and essentially the cigarettes mess with my health. On top of just wanting me to have some time to like, be a person and have a life because I cannot have a life living with him. I really wanted to work on my mental health and not feel guilty for getting a hobby because he'll tell me he doesn't want me to go out and leave him alone because he's lonely. 

He decided he wanted to live with just me. He doesn't go see her at all, he only sees the other sister 1x a week, if that. He is always here, I get 0 privacy. It's constant, I am so, fed up, and it's not even that bad?  According to him he likes living with me, I think it's because I relatively leave him alone and honestly after a few months of trying to push him to clean up his snot puddles or flush or smoke outside I have straight up given up and let him do whatever the fuck he wants to. I still bitch about it though. 

My eldest sister cut me off after I freaked out and asked her about something he was doing, which I thought could've been diabetes related. She got upset that I mishandled it, or that I asked her what to do despite being the one that has been living with him the last 3 years. So I can't ask her for help anymore. She's just out of it. Which, fair, I don't blame her. 

But then he started having what we thought and were told were TIAS like 4 months ago, and everything started getting worse because his memory is noticeably slipping. We just found out like two days ago that he's having memory lapses because of cognitive decline, not mini strokes, he scored 18/30 on the test they gave him. And I'm happy he's not having strokes but his health is stressing me out so bad and just the stress of the last year has been giving me physical symptoms of stress and anxiety.  

I've tried to get therapy and start meds but not being able to keep a job restricts me from insurance, and also I can't pay out of pocket because any money I do get goes towards bills since I'm not working full time. I'm restricted from donating plasma because my protein has been too low to donate, my limbs hurt lol. 
Like I'm spiraling and like I've been planning to like run away for the last 3 months after telling my sisters I can't do this shit anymore but then a neighbor called APS and the lady said that the concern was abusive language and so now I can't even like run away and live in my car because she came and talked to him and left a paper about an investigation being opened up and yeah. I told him I want to call her and like ask for help because I am not his caregiver, I refuse the role. Both of my sisters have worked in dementia care nursing homes, the one with 6 kids has for 10 years and she's still medical, the other one flunked out of being a nurse but she still has more experience with this. Watching him age scares the fuck out of me because I'm not sure what to expect, I've wonky worked in factories. I've grown up dreading the day he got old because all I've heard was he's old for being a dad and are you sure that's not you're grandpa and that made me not want to have kids past 25, so I'm not having kids now. 

I don't abuse my dad, I get snappy, I don't call him out of his name. I get on little tirades because I bitch about my mental health, but I don't outright blame him for it. I do cuss a lot but that's standard for me, and I'm loud but that's how I talk. 
I'vw been told my tone is so bad because I sound mad a lot but I'm not mad in a general sense. I'm overwhelmed, I'm over stimulated. I depressed, I (don't,) want to die lol.

My dad deserves to live with the two kids that want him to live with, I've asked him to stay with either of them so I could have some time to myself, I've asked him to stay at the one sisters longer on Sundays so I can have some breathing room. I've asked him to help wash a dish or smoke outside, I've asked him to help. I've asked my sisters to help. But it's all denied. 

And I've told him I can't do this anymore because my mental health is so bad. I'd never do anything to hurt my dad but even before being depended on by him my depression and stress regulation was in a hole but I'm not sure how much longer I personally have before I just kind of give up on myself.   He told me that he'll get me help, but I feel like it's beyond that. I've asked for help and I've tried to help myself, but I'm backed into a corner and I don't think we come back from this. I don't want to get healthy just to keep taking care of him. I want a family. I want a life. I want to not have to care about another person that I don't even feel like took care of me. 
He said I'm obligated to take care of him because I'm his daughter. He has two others. He likes to live with me. That's just because he can take advantage of the fact that I was taught to shut up and take it since a young girl. I'm done. I'm done I'm done. 

Like I'm literally daydreaming about a state 600 miles away and about the life I might be able to achieve there if I can just get away. How id eat, what hobbies I want to get into, health ideas, aesthetic. Like I dream of a woman who isn't me now but maybe.

I really miss the old set. Them sitting around the table, it felt like friends catching up, having morning coffee together. It was relaxed, comfortable, warm, and inviting.

Now the POD looks and feels like almost every other podcast out there. Them sitting back in chairs, mic centric, with nothing to really set their things on, it looks uncomfortable (to me). It feels distant and disconnected.  
  
I feel discomfort watching now, and I find myself waiting for the show to end instead of being disappointed that it's over, like I used to. I understand this could very much just be a ""me"" thing, and I feel bad for feeling this way.  (I'm sensory sensitive, even to visuals and energy/vibes.)

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

Started chatting up with a junior from his Medical College.  
This lady seemed intelligent, really good looking and confident.

Was nice she was trying to talk in broken Hindi (I am a Northie and comfortable in English and Malayalam), and I was trying to chat her up in my broken Malayalam. We also connected over shared veganism.

  
We eventually escaped the shaadi, for coffee, and ended up at her place. Hooking up. Felt nice. I got her flowers and wrote her a short letter.

We kept on texting as I left the town, it was amazing!  
but I noticed something subtle weird stuff happening:

* Repeated mention of her from being an adivasi community. (I do not consider it changes any feelings for me towards a person/ dating). But she kept on repeating again.
* She felt the world is extremely discriminating (I disagree somewhat) and minorities are tortured in India (I agreed)
* Everyone should be vegan, and she can not see people who eat meat in a good light (I disagree).

  
The last reason got to me. I asked her if she would see Muslims, minorities who eat meat in the same light? I personally feel veganism should be a choice.

This made her furious, as she felt, people should not be kept on the same pedestal due to historic discrimination (Dafuq??) and mentioned we can not date as I am discriminatory.

I did not text back.  
I kina feel sad, as she was cute and ambitious.  
But felt really immature. Should I have continued talking to her?

1pst1si,https://i.redd.it/cgf7t4c9ep8g1.png,I Found My True Alpha,"Mate .”

“Ex mate .” I told him, shaking my head. I looked him in the eyes .



“I, Ashlyn Knight, future Alpha of the Emerald lake pack, reject you, Ian Walker, future Alpha of the Blue Moon Pack .” With that I grabbed the door handle and slammed the door close behind me. I could hear him screaming, but I just kept walking .



\*\*\*\*\*\*



Waking up, feeling overwhelmed with excitement. Today is my 18th birthday, the day I find out if my boyfriend of the past two years is my fated mate. Ian Walker, the future Alpha of the Blue Moon pack. Tundra, my wolf, is equally excited to find out if Jax, Ian’s wolf, is her fated mate.



Getting out of bed, I headed to the bathroom to have a shower and get myself ready. After I blow dry my hair and curling the ends, I apply some eyeliner and mascara. I’m looking in the bathroom mirror, feeling pretty good about myself. My auburn hair fell to the middle of my back. It’s layered and has rose gold highlights. My emerald green eyes are sparkling with gold flakes. My black eyeliner makes my eye colour pop.



I walked out into my bedroom to get dressed. I choose dark blue skinny jeans, a light pink cami, and a floral knit cardigan. I’m not one to wear heels, so I just put on my white sneakers. I'm a pretty laid back person, I would only get dolled up if I was going somewhere fancy. I'm more of a ""Tomboy"".



It was about 9am when I entered the kitchen to find my aunt Grace drinking her coffee.



“Happy Birthday my Ashlyn,” she sings out, getting up from the table to give me a big smile.



“You must be so excited for today,” she smiled at me. My Aunt Grace is only nine years older than me. She's my guardian and best friend. She and her mate, Brad, have been my guardians since my parents' death, almost ten years ago.



“I’m going to go find Ian. I’m sure he must be back from training this morning,” I told her.



“Good luck my dear, I love you”



“I love you too”, I called to her before I shuted the front door.



I started walking towards the pack house. It’s about a 10-minute walk on this chilly morning. It looks like we could get some snow today. Tundra keeps me warm. One of the pluses of having a wolf.



I’m surprised that Ian wouldn’t have come over this morning after training. He was just as excited about my birthday as I was. Even if he’s been acting weird these last couple of weeks. I know he must be under a lot of pressure, with the Alpha ceremony coming up soon. Ian is soon to take over from his father, Alpha Jason. He did text me last night to tell me how excited he was today and that he loved me. He had gone out with some of his friends last night. I'm more of a homebody, or an outdoorsman. Being in a bar really isn't my thing.



I walked into the pack house and was met with the most delicious smell. It’s musky with cedar wood, maybe a hint of cinnamon. It has my mouth watering and Tundra purring in my head.



“Thats our mate,” she purred to me.



Following the scent, we made our way up the stairs. We ended up on the fourth floor, which I know is the Alpha floor. I’ve spent a lot of time here the last couple of years with Ian. But even before Ian and I were ever a couple, I spent a lot of time here with the former Luna. I kept walking until I was in front of his room.



“Oh my goddess, Tundra! Ian’s our mate! I can’t believe it,” I exclaimed to my wolf.



Noises pulled me out of my excitement, coming from the other side of his door. What is going on? I thought to myself.



I went to turn the handle, and it was unlocked. So I pushed it open and my eyes went wide. I’m not naive. I knew what they were doing. He had his back to the door and didn’t see me in the doorway.



Tundra let a loud growl. And the room went quiet. Ian turned his head towards me, and I could see Nicole looked up to see who was standing there.



“Ashlyn?” Ian stuttered.



“It’s not what it looks like.” He stuttered out as he’s standing in front of me.



I’m not sure where my bravery came from. It smashed my heart to pieces, but I wasn’t going to give him the satisfaction of knowing that he hurts me. He’s his own mate. He was my best friend, they both were.



“Is there anything else I’m missing? Oh sorry, my mistake, my mate and best friend are having fun.” I rushed out. I should be furious. I should be yelling and throwing things at him, but I couldn’t. If he loved me like he said, I wouldn’t be looking at the scene before me. How can you do this to someone that you care about? If he didn't want to be with me, that's all he had to say.



He looks at me with his mouth open in shock. Finally, snapping out of it, he sniffs the air and his eyes go wide.



“Mate.”



“Ex mate.” I told him, shaking my head. I looked him in the eyes.



“I, Ashlyn Knight, future Alpha of the Emerald Lake pack, reject you, Ian Walker, future Alpha of the Blue Moon Pack.” With that, I grabbed the door handle and slammed the door behind me. I could hear him screaming, but I just kept walking. I was walking down the stairs and I had almost made it to the front door when I was pulled out of my trance.



“Happy Birthday Ashlyn” and before I could even register who it was. Breathing in, I knew it was Alpha Jason.



“Thank you, Alpha Jason,” I whispered.



He looked down at me. I was 5’6” but he was at least 6’2”. Looking up at him, I knew I couldn’t stay in Ian’s pack.



“Alpha Jason?” I stuttered.



“Yes, my dear? Are you okay?” He looked worried.



“Yes, Alpha, thank you. I was wondering if I could ask your permission to leave the pack. I would like to do some traveling.” I told him matter-of-factly.



“Of course, Ashlyn, but did something happen? Where’s Ian?” He asked, confused.



“With all due respect, Alpha, I think I’ll let Alpha Ian explain,” I sighed.



“That good, huh?” He let out a sigh and looked at me with concern.



“Yeah” I whispered. Alpha Jason has always been kind to me. After his mate passed away, we spent a lot of time together. Ian was always off with friends and I knew Alpha was grieving, so I made a point to be around the packing house to help and keep him company. We have a father-daughter relationship and I was going to miss him.



We both turned to look up when we heard a commotion coming from up the stairs.



“You go, my dear, please call from time to time”. He smiled and stepped out of my way. I nodded to him and headed to the door. Once I was out of the pack house, I started running.



Ashlyn



I don’t remember walking into my house. My Aunt Grace was sitting in her chair reading one of her romance novels. She must not have a shift at the pack hospital today. She looked up from her book when I entered the foyer.



“Ashlyn? What are you doing at home already?” She asked, looking at her watch.



I sat down on the couch across from her chair and told her everything that had happened. Surprisingly, the tears never came by the time I finished. I must be in shock. It’s hard to explain the level of betrayal I was now feeling. I've known both of them for ten years. I was having a hard time comprehending everything that had just happened today. And it was barely ten in the morning.



She told me to go upstairs and to pack a bag and to meet her back in the kitchen. She was going to call my uncle to let him know that we were taking a little trip into the human city, a couple of hours away from us.



I don’t remember getting in the passenger seat of my aunt’s SUV, or leaving the pack border. I was so stuck in my thoughts. How can you say you love someone and then doing this with their “best friend”?



I had to shut off my phone since they both wouldn’t stop calling or texting me. I even had to block the mindlink since it kept buzzing and it was giving me a headache. A mindlink is a way the pack can communicate through our thoughts. It does have a distance restriction, so it will go away when we are out of range.



My Aunt placed a shoe box on my lap. Looking away from the window, I looked at her and then at the box. I didn’t even realize she had a shoe box on her lap while she was driving.



“What is this?” I asked.



“Just open it” she answered. Looking back at the road.



Opening the box, I noticed that it had a bunch of documents and some old photos. I can see my birth certificate, and maybe some bank documents. After a few minutes of flipping through everything, I noticed a photograph of my parents and me. I had also noticed a few pictures of me at the lake with a boy about my age, but I couldn’t remember him.



“I took that picture of the three of you before you came back with me for your visit.” She spoke.



“What is all of this?” I asked, motioning to the box in my lap.



“This is everything that your parents and pack left you. We will go to the bank when we get to the city to get everything switched over. Then we can also go shopping and get you everything you might need or want. While you’ve been sitting there, have you decided what you want to do, where you want to go?”



“I don’t know. It’s not like I have lots of money, and you’re my only family. I always thought I’d stay in Blue moon with…..” I couldn’t even speak his name. How could I think that the future Alpha could actually care about someone like me.



No one in that pack knew that I was to be the Alpha of Emerald Lake until I rejected Ian. You have to use your full name and title to break the bond. I’m of pure Alpha blood. I should have been the perfect Luna. But there’s no way I could go back there after that humiliation.



“I will never be with a cheater. We are worth so much more.” Tundra growled.



“I know we are, but I just never thought that I’d live my life without Ian.”



Staring out the window, I started to think about my future. The Alpha King had a university-type school. Maybe I can go and take some classes. I’ll definitely need to find a new pack since there’s no way I can stay in my current pack. I will never submit to Ian or Nicole.



We finally arrived at the bank. It was a massive building. It was at least 20 floors. The entire building looked like they built it from glass panels. Aunt Grace parked the SUV down the street from the bank, and there were buildings everywhere. I assume we are in the downtown area of the city.



“Ashlyn, bring the box and your wallet with us, please?” She asked before exiting the SUV.



Grabbing the box and my purse, we made our way up the street and into the bank. It was just as massive on the inside, with white marble and dark oak desks. There were crystal chandeliers hanging from the 12-foot ceilings, and I wasn’t expecting the bank to look like that.



Aunt Grace walked up to reception and asked to speak to Mr. Allen Fisher about the Knight account. The woman immediately picked up her phone to place a call, or maybe to page Mr. Fisher. She stood up and instructed that we follow her. The woman was young, with long dark hair and brown eyes. She was dressed in a pencil skirt down past her knees, a white blouse and a pair of black heels.



We walked over to an elevator that was located at the back of the giant first floor. The receptionist pushed the button, and the doors opened. We all stepped in and she scanned her keycard and hit the 20.



It took us a few minutes to get up to the 20th floor. Why would we need to see a banker on the 20th floor? Were my parents really that wealthy? I don’t remember much since I was only 8 years old when they passed away. I was too young to start learning the business side of running a pack, including the finances. My father did start training me though. It’s never too early to learn. But I remember we had stuff, but nothing flashy. If we had money, I never noticed or I was too young.



The elevator doors opened to a grand foyer with a dark oak desk and massive dark oak doors stood behind it. Aunt Grace and I stepped out of the elevator.



“Mr. Fisher should be out to greet you in a moment.” The reception told us.



“Thank you,” my aunt spoke before the doors shuted and she was gone.



As soon as I turned away from the elevator, the massive doors behind the desk opened up. In walked a man. I could smell he was a wolf. He’s tall, about 6’3” with dark brown hair cut short on the sides and styled on top. He has deep brown eyes and a glowing tan. Wolves age differently, but I assume he’s around 40 years old. He was wearing a navy suit with a lighter blue shirt and a dark blue tie. And very fancy black shoes.



“Oh, Grace, it’s so good to see you.” He spoke to my aunt, shaking her hand.



“This must be Ashlyn Knight?” He turned his attention to me. He extended his hand out and it shocked me.



“I’m Allen Fisher. You, my dear, look so much like your mother.”



“Thank you”, I told him with a smile.



“Come, we have so much to discuss.” He led us into his office.



Mr. Fisher’s office was enormous. Floor to ceiling windows covered two walls and then bookshelves covered the other two, which were full of books. There was a massive dark oak desk with two chairs at the front of it. It also had a seating area with black leather couches and a TV hung on the wall. There was also a bar area by where the TV hung.



“Please, have a seat for you two. Would you like anything?” He asked.



“I would love a coffee, please? If it’s not too much trouble. I’ve had a long morning.” I asked him.



“Of course, my dear. Let me mindlink my assistant, and he will bring some coffees.”



“Thank you.” I nodded.



“So I’m assuming you have all the documents, birth certificate and ID. While we wait for coffee, I’ll get started with the transfer of accounts into your name.” He asked.



Aunt Grace took the box I placed on my lap and went through it for all the documents. I reached into my purse so I could hand Mr. Fisher my driver’s license.



“Wonderful.” He stated, and then he went to his computer and started typing. I looked over at my aunt. She looked at me in return.



“Everything is going to be okay,” she told me.



Just then, a younger man wearing a dark blue suit with a white dress shirt walked into the office. He has dirty blond hair cut short and blue eyes. He was very handsome and you could see all his hard muscles under his clothes. He seemed to be around 25 years old. He walked over to the desk and handed out our coffees.



“Thank you, Rogers. Grace, Ashlyn, this is my assistant, Blake Rogers.” He introduced us. We both shook hands while Mr. Fisher continued the introduction.



“Miss Ashlyn is here to claim the Knight account.” Mr. Fisher continues. Blake raised an eyebrow at me and smirked. He was studying me intently. I looked away from him, confused, and turned my attention back to Mr. Fisher.



“Mr. Fisher, I’m not sure why the Knight account, or I guess my account is so important?” Mr. Fisher looked away from his computer to look at me, and then he turned his attention to my aunt.



“You haven’t told her?” He asked her.



“Haven’t you told me what?” I asked her, turning my body to look at her.



“Rogers, why don’t we finish all this paperwork in your office and give these ladies a chance to talk?” Mr. Fisher stood from his chair, walking to his office door with Rogers on his heel. When I heard the door click, I grabbed my coffee that Blake had brought in and took a sip. Today has been way too stressful. I held my coffee in my lap and turned to face my aunt. She was looking down at her interlaced fingers on her lap.



“Aunt Grace, what are you not telling me?”

1pst0xj,https://i.redd.it/lvstjzy0ep8g1.png,My husband didn't just forget our anniversary. He replaced me with his first love in front of everyone.,"At the party my husband threw, I wore the red dress he gave me, expecting an apology—but instead, I saw him and Lilith standing together in matching white suits, like a disgusting couple.



Lilith.



My sister. His best friend. His business partner, his sister-in-law.



She talked to my husband like he belonged to her. She tilted her head, smiled up at him, hand casually resting on his arm like she had rights to touch him that way.



""Congratulations to Rhett and Lilith!"" People swarmed around. Praises. Toasts. Applause exploded.



I stood there with my heart splintering and my soul trembling as it finally clicked that I'd always been option two for Rhett.



All those so-called overtime hours and social engagements for the past ten months, he had actually been with her the whole time.



Tears welled up in my eyes, and a fire seemed to ignite in my chest.



I watched them cut the cake together while everyone cheered.



Like a married couple.



And the truth hit me so painfully, so suddenly—this wasn't our anniversary dinner.



This wasn't for us.



This was for them.



Ritter didn't just forget our anniversary.



He forgot me.



Losing him wasn't a tragedy. Staying would've been.



——



I hurried through the kitchen with my thoughts bumping like bumper cars and my nerves glitching, trying to keep track of everything at once. My eyes bounced between the dishes lined up on the counter, the table decorated exactly how I imagined, and the clock ticked way too fast for my movements. Oh God. He'd be home soon and I still hadn't added the last touches to the cake.



I rushed toward the fridge, grabbed the tray of chocolate-dipped strawberries, and somehow my slippery fingers caught a utensil instead. Everything went down in one humiliating clatter along with me, frosting smearing across the tile like the day was testing my patience. I gasped as a mild but stinging pain shot through my lower back from the sudden crash, and for a second I sat there staring at the mess like it was my enemy.



""Perfect,"" I muttered under my breath, feeling frustration simmering in my chest. First the timing, now this. The day had been one disaster after another, and I was trying so hard to make it beautiful.



I crouched down and cleaned the icing, the counters, the scattered tools, trying not to think about how ridiculous I must look. And then the panic dumped down on me.



I still hadn't showered, my hair was a mess And I probably smelled like food myself. And time was running out. I wiped my hands, straightened up, and took a shaky breath, silently begging the universe for just a little more time before everything could end up in a blunder.



I rushed through my shower faster than I should have, barely taking the time to scrub myself clean, as the steam clung to my skin. I yanked my pink dress into place and pulled my hair back into a half messy ponytail, that was one thing I loved the most about myself, I had Rapunzel's hair, blonde and bright, okay maybe not that long, but one half of hers, since it goes down till my hips.



My hands trembled slightly while I slid my hoop earrings in place, the pair Rhett always said suited me best, like they were made just for my face and no one else's.



My makeup was simple, the way he liked it. Soft blush, brown liner, a bit of mascara, a touch of gloss that tasted like berries.



The timer dinged from the kitchen and my heart jumped. I hurried toward the oven and pulled out the lasagna, the heat rolling onto my very cool face. The smell filled the room in seconds. Warmly nostalgic and cheesy. A smell that reminded me of my aunt's house, where little gestures meant everything and effort never felt one sided.



I moved dish by dish onto the table, arranging everything until it looked like love if love could sit in bowls and platters. Lasagna, steak sandwiches, taco salad, mexican rice, still steaming, chicken noodle soup because he always said it tasted like comfort. Crispy wings brushed with honey, creamy corn sprinkled with paprika the way he loves.



Then the desserts. A classic banana split the way he prefers. And a nut cake with strawberry topping because it has been his favorite for as long as I have known him. I took special baking classes to make it instead of getting it custom made.



I had practiced this recipe for three weeks in a rented class on the other side of town, pretending it was about learning a new skill when really the only person I wanted to impress was my husband. I burned my fingers and cake itself, and everyone at the clinic laughed when I came in smelling like sugar and panic.



I stepped back and looked at the table, pride and love spreading in my chest like a mini halo. It looked beautiful, with a color of warmth and effort.



I looked down at my engagement ring, the diamond glowing dimly in the golden lamps and candles. Six years together, five years married. Sometimes it still felt unreal, I got to marry my childhood crush, my first boyfriend, my one and only, my forever. That kind of love always felt rare to me, like something people dream about but never actually get to live in reality.



I glanced at the antique clock we bought together, and sighed deeply in relief, there were still fifteen minutes left meaning I hadn't been late or way too early either.



His message lit up the screen while I was still tying the last ribbon on the cloth napkins, stupidly feeling proud of how picture-perfect everything looked.



Don't wait up. Might be late, maybe staying at the office.



No congratulations. No goodnight. No sweet name.



I stood there staring at those few words until they blurred like I had suddenly developed dyslexia. Not because the message was rude or cold, but because it was empty. Like we'd stopped being us and I hadn't noticed the exact moment it happened.



I set my phone down on the table beside the candles I'd lit-soft white ones he used to say made the house feel warm and cozy.



Everything looked warm, pretty and romantic. Everything except the part where he wasn't coming home.



I tried telling myself he was just tired. That work was insane and this contract had everyone on edge. That he wasn't avoiding me-just overwhelmed. And maybe that used to be enough of an excuse.



But lately? I couldn't tell if I'm loosing him slowly, or if he'd just slipped away while I was busy believing we were fine.



My phone screen dimmed, leaving his message glowing faintly like it was mocking me. No happy anniversary. No heart emoji. Nothing that even resembled a husband remembering his wife.



I scrolled up through our old messages-little flirty jokes, random I-love-yous from months ago. They felt like someone else's memories now. Someone who still mattered to him.



I gazed at the oversized wedding photo, our beaming faces frozen in time. The smiles we wore, radiant and genuine, seemed almost surreal now. Scattered around it were snapshots of us, carefully captured moments from our journey, laughter pained in frames. But the question lingered, a whisper in the loneliness, what happened to that us, the one that seemed invincible.



I checked my notifications again even though I already knew-no messages from his family, none from mine, certainly. No calls, no texts saying congratulations or love. Not even a lazy hope you two enjoy your day.



It was almost funny. No one remembered.



But the sting wasn't from them. They had already taught me blood didn't make family.



It was from him. The only person whose attention, whose presence, whose love I still wanted, had forgotten too.



I pulled out a chair and sat down at the beautifully set table-two plates, two wine glasses, the yellow flowers he once said reminded him of me.



I stared at the empty seat across from me and whispered to the wistful memory of my husband.



""Happy anniversary, Rhett.""



Then I wiped my face, because crying over someone who didn't bother showing up felt like giving him more than he'd earned.



And sitting there in that heartbreaking silence, forcing myself to breathe around the lump in my ribs, I honestly thought this was the worst it could feel. But I had no idea a deeper break was already on its way-one that would make tonight feel like a courtesy in comparison.



I called Rhett ten times after that. Each time it rang, my jaw grinded a little tighter. I even typed out a text loaded with every ounce of irritation burning through my veins, but I deleted it. He didn't deserve that kind of reaction yet. I wanted to watch how far he'd take this screw-up. I wanted to see how a man who heard his wife remind him about their anniversary just a day ago could erase it like it meant nothing.



My eyes drifted toward the gallery wall again, to the pictures that always remained like a scared hereditary. More photos of Rhett...with Lilith.



Her smile, her eyes, her hand on his shoulder. She's everywhere. Ski trips, beaches, sky diving, paragliding, parties., success and adventure. All the things he never did with me. I never cared before. I never dug deep enough to compare because I trusted him.



But suddenly it felt like he had lived that wild, carefree version of himself with her and all I got was the disciplined, serious, corporate always occupied version. A man too mature or too controlled to act like life is something you feel, not something you manage. And without taking a single bite of food, something inside me felt heavy and nauseous, like my stomach relocated into my ribcage.



Lilith used to be the quiet insecurity I never admitted out loud. The better daughter. The elegant one. The one who was always praised because she had logic and grace and that cold confidence people seem to worship. Raven hair, model body, ice-blue eyes, excellent business instincts.



And me? I was the messy, emotional, loud, rule-breaking curvy blonde teenager who always heard she needed to behave, shrink, soften, become less. I worked hard to grow into myself. To love the body I live in. To actually feel proud when I look in the mirror. But some shadows have stubborn claws. Even though she left six years ago to help turn the company global, those old fractures never really healed. Her leaving gave me space, gave Rhett space. It let him finally see me as more than the wild girl everyone warned him about.



People love pointing fingers at rebellion as if confidence is a flaw. They hate it when you refuse to bow to their outdated beliefs. And now, with my spoiled younger brother handling the China branch and Lilith back home for the last ten months, she returned like royalty. Parties and champagne, velvet boxes and constant praise. Everything I never received and honestly never wanted if it comes wrapped in expected performance and glitter instead of sincerity. Fake love tastes like sugar and ash. And I had been long done, swallowing it.



Ever since she came back, the two of them have been glued together like some inseparable duo, and every time I try to bring it up, he gets defensive. He tilts his head, scoffs, and says, We're just friends, Perry, and she's your sister. Like the idea is absurd. Like I'm the one creating problems out of my delusions.



But I'm his wife, not a spectator. I see things differently, the same way he would if I started spending late nights and work hours with another man, let it be his brother. The difference is, I know how to hold my boundaries. I understand loyalty, respect and marriage.



And now I can't help wondering if he's with her right now too. If she's there laughing at another one of his jokes or giving him that approving look she's always had in her pocket since we were kids.



It feels like I slipped back into those years before we got married, when Rhett was nothing more than a distant daydream. When he barely said more than a polite hello while my stupid heart delusionally built futuristic scenarios around the smallest interaction.



Only now, the ache is worse because he's not just some untouchable crush. He's my husband. The man I vowed my life to, the one I chose in front of God and family. And somehow, I feel more invisible now than I did back then.



To keep myself from losing my mind, I shifted my attention to the food. If I was going to sit here alone on our anniversary, then fine, I'd at least enjoy something that didn't disappoint me. No way was I letting all those hours of cooking go to waste just because my husband forgot what day it was. People might treat me like I'm optional, but I refused to do that to myself.



For a brief, unhinged chaotic second, I imagined driving straight through the glass doors of his office like some unhinged Hollywood action heroine. The dramatic style, where alarms go off and everyone screams while I step out adjusting my sunglasses. But my car isn't nearly strong enough for that kind of entrance, and honestly, I'd rather spend my Sunday in peace before serving Rhett a Monday he'll never forget.



So I ate. And goodness, the food was incredible. Maybe heartbreak sharpens appetite because I devoured most of it. Thank God I'd been learning to cook because tonight felt like a small reward I gave myself. I poured a generous glass of wine, enjoyed dinner and dessert, and actually felt proud of myself in a way no one else ever bothered to acknowledge.



My heels came off, music came on, and suddenly I was dancing around the living room barefoot, singing On Top of the World from Barbie Princess Charm School like I was twenty again and didn't care who saw me. It felt freeing, stupid, but freeing.



I don't have the balance



Think I'm gonna fall



Wish I had the talent



I don't belong here at all



Drowning in the pressure



In above my head.



Why did I think I could do this



I could have walked away instead



This is my chance to break free



Everything's depending on me



And if I keep trying I'll be



On top of the world



Where I can see everything before me



Reaching up to touch the sky



On top of the world



All of my dreams are rushing toward me



Stretching out my wings to fly



On top of the world



On top of the world



After that prideful attempt to dance like a ballerina. I put on a movie. Not romance. I don't even think I have a favorite romance movie. Something always annoys me midway through and I end up rolling my eyes. So I watched The Equalizer. Both parts. McCall's quiet devotion to his wife always gets me. The way he still loves her, still honors her memory, reading a hundred books because she would want to. That type of unconditional and devoted love hits somewhere deep and different.



Rhett hates books. He once said story lovers lived too far from reality, but he never mocked my hobbies, and I never mocked his. We understood each other. Or at least I thought we did. Somewhere between the ending credits and the silence of my house, a question slipped into my mind, soft but sharp.



Does he still love me?



Anger buzzed under my skin like drugs and electricity, and sleep wasn't even an option. So I did what I always do when my mind turns into a storm: I ran. Earlier than usual, before sunrise even thought about showing up.



I jogged the perimeter of our so-called dream mansion perched on top of the LA hills. From a distance, the house looked impressive, expensive, and untouchable. But with every step, the glass walls reminded me of something else. How fragile everything actually was. How one boulder, one fracture, could bring it all crashing down. Just like us.



The guards stood by the gates, watching me with the kind of pity I wanted to rip off their faces. They knew today wasn't just another date. They knew what it was supposed to be. A special occasion, a celebration. Instead, it felt like I was running laps through the ruins of my loneliness that my husband brought upon me.



By the time I finished, my lungs burned and my legs felt like an elephant's leg, but at least the noise in my head had subsided a little. I walked back inside, stripped down, and eased into the hot tub. The heat embraced like a selfless friend, melting tension from my muscles even though the ache in my chest stayed stubborn.



Eventually I dragged myself to bed, still damp, still exhausted in ways that had nothing to do with my body. I slipped into silk pajama shorts, curled into the sheets, and went to a place where anger and heartbreak couldn't reach me.



When I finally woke up, I shot upright so fast my vision blurred. Two in the afternoon. Seriously? I blinked at the clock again just to make sure it wasn't joking with me. Then I flopped back against the pillows with a long, defeated sigh. Clearly, I'd been more drained than I thought. At least it was Sunday, and thankfully I had leftovers since I gave the cook the day off.



I wandered into the kitchen, reheated everything, and ate in comfortable silence while sipping coffee strong enough to wake the dead. Eventually, I grabbed my phone from where it was charging and scrolled through my notifications.



My charming husband: nothing. Not a single text. Not even a pathetic hey or sorry.



Of course.



But then I saw messages from my aunt and my cousin, long sweet paragraphs checking on me, reminding me they loved me, asking how the night went. And it pulled a small smile out of me. They always showed up. Not once in years had they gone a week without checking in. My cousin was the oneswho called me a soul sister and meant it.



Funny how sometimes the people who aren't obligated to love you do it better than the ones who vowed they would.



""Hey Rapunzel? What's up, did Rhett keep you in bed all night and day?"" she joked, her voice playful while I could hear muffled chatter and clinking in the background. She was clearly multitasking at her shop, probably charming customers while roasting me at the same time.



I didn't even respond with words, just let out a sigh. That alone was enough. She always picked up on my silence faster than anyone.



""NO! NO! Perry, don't tell me that fu-cker forgot your anniversary. Please tell me he did not."" She screamed ready to avenge on my behalf.



""He did,"" I muttered resignedly. ""Well, technically he sent a dry text saying he was staying at the office. So yeah, I celebrated it alone.""



There was a beat of quiet disbelief, then she snapped. ""I cannot believe it, Perry. The audacity of that douchebag. If I were you, I'd storm into his office and tie him to his da-mn chair and make him eat every bite of food I made."" Her voice got louder like she was ready to fight a war, then she paused dramatically to breathe like she was rehearsing some intense monologue in a movie.



I couldn't help smiling a little. The image was tempting. But I wasn't giving Rhett the satisfaction of ruining the night I worked so hard to make it decent for myself. Even if my heart still ached, at least my peace hadn't completely dissolved.



""I just wanted to relax before I strike,"" I shared sipping my coffee like a villain planning her arc.



""That's my girl. Do not let it slide,"" she said proudly, sass practically dripping through the phone. After a moment, her voice softened. ""How're you really doing, Perry?""



""I don't know. Hurt, confused, probably more angry,"" I admitted. A vein pulsed at my temple as pressure built under my chest, like grief and frustration were arguing about who deserved more space.



""He still hasn't come home?"" she asked after a few seconds, like she was piecing together something heavier.



""I don't know. I was asleep."" Confidentially, I was still wondering if he's eaten or rested, exhaustion had a veen circling him like paparazzi and every time I voiced my concern, he'd shut me down with that maddening phrase - you wouldn't understand. As if his struggles were a solo journey, one I wasn't privy to, as if his frustrations weren't understandable to me, like his weariness was not my concern.



""Well, since I'm not there, you can be sure he's alive,"" she deadpanned, and I let out a short laugh. But the humor didn't fully settle. The thought of Rhett and Lilith hovered in my head like bees I couldn't shoo away. Had he stayed with her all night? Were they together right now too? On our anniversary? Did he even realize what kind of line he was toeing? Or was he just cluelessly wrapped up in work like always? And if nothing ever happened between them all these years, why did everything suddenly feel threatening now?



""Everything okay, Rapunzel?"" she asked gently when the silence stretched.



""Yeah,"" I lied, nudging my nail against my lip. I don't want to talk about something I am not certain about yet. ""I'll call you later tonight. Let's see how he uses the rest of our anniversary. Maybe he can earn a lifeline.""



She chuckled. ""See ya, tiger. Love you.""



""Love you,"" I murmured, distracted and staring at nothing, my thoughts wandering faster with every other thought.



I spent the afternoon stretched across my bed like a spoiled cat, skincare still dewy on my face while I read a Lara Voss novel. God, that woman could write. Her stories always hit that sweet spot where the heroine has a backbone and the hero acts like an actual grown man with depth, not some half-formed man-child wandering through life with an unrealistic jawline and zero emotional intelligence.



Her male characters were dangerous, respectful, and obsessed in a healthy way. Meanwhile, the ones in real life? Yeah... I was starting to think men like hers were endangered or just fully fictional.



By the time I devoured half the book and my stomach growled like I hadn't eaten in ten years, I dragged myself to the kitchen for snacks. On the walk there, my gaze drifted around the house and realization sinks in like a slow poison injected.



Everything was Rhett. His taste, his structure. His clean, magazine-spread vision. There were maybe two things in the entire place that belonged to me, tiny showpieces I fought for and now barely noticed. When we got married, he already owned this glass palace and I just moved in like some Disney character who believed love made everything glow. I was too in love, too proud I'd married the man I used to crush on so hard it literally made me blind to notice any missing pieces.



But now? It felt like someone adjusted the focus in my brain. Suddenly I was spotting details I'd ignored for years. Maybe I finally developed more brain cells. Maybe pain works like a magnifying glass.



This house wasn'l't a home. Not anymore. Rhett was barely present, always rushing somewhere, always busy, always prioritizing something else, someone else. And everything somehow circled right back to Lilith returning like a ancient disaster no one asked for.



Even though my heart felt bruised and burdened, I refused to be the kind of woman who curled into bed and cried herself numb. Not yet. I had one more day. One Sunday that belonged to me. Then tomorrow.



He'd feel every bit of the heartbreak he handed me thrown right in front at him.

Finally I got something I'm excited about. Lychee infused coffee from Colombia.

I've never tried before.

Brewing with simple V60. 15g of beans. Grind with ZP6 using 5.0 setting.

Mmm. Smells like lychee. All as expected so far. Brewing. 95c water.

Coffee tastes good. I can taste a distinct lychee flavor. Not a notes, but flavor. Nothing surprising. Kind of boring so far, right?

Few minutes later my wife opens the door from upstairs and asks if I can feel a smell of a weed. ""Is that your coffee?"" - she asked. I was surprised but answered that if it smells like weed then no, it's not my coffee. My son closed the window thinking that the strong smell of weed is coming from outside.

Turned out the coffee actually smells to them like marijuana.

They were able to confirm it again when I brewed the coffee again.

I found that kind of funny and wanted to share. Have you tried lychee infused coffee? Does it smell like a weed to you?

1pssy6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1pssy6m/advice_for_helping_my_cats_get_along/,Advice for helping my cats get along?,"I had my first cat, Coffee Bean aka CB (~3F tabby) for about a year before I got my second cat Calamari Marinara aka Cali (4F tuxedo) about 2 months ago.

I went through the introduction phase with the cats having separate halves of the apartment and switching the cats' ""home base"" every few days. I tried to do things to help scent swap and fed them between a shared door and all that stuff. Save for a few brief moments when one would slip through the door.

After introducing them it seemed CB was not a big fan of the arrangement and would hiss and even swat at Cali when they started to get close. I knew CB was a bit territorial so nothing unexpected.

After a while they started to seem to be more comfortable with eachother and would sit or lay somewhat close to eachother when previously they would only be close during feeding time.

There was one moment the other day that was a lil funny where CB came up behind Cali and started sniffing her butt, and when Cali turned around CB hissed at her and then just stared at her. Ears were up, fur was flat, tails were calm, there were no indications of nastiness really.

Every now and again CB will hiss at Cali and again no signs of aggression outside of maybe a bit of hair sticking up, but if Cali is particularly skittish that day her tail will start shaking more and scurry away.

Lately Cali has had a lot of energy so every now and then the girls will start chasing eachother. I think it's playful but CB will still hiss now and then (again ears seem calm usually), so I will still keep an eye on things and try to break it up if she starts hissing.

This most recent time they started chasing eachother and I think I saw CB's ears go back a lil. They ran into the other room and I heard a hiss/growl that I don't think I've heard before, not sure which cat it came from (may have been Cali?) but I immediately separated them, grabbed CB's water bowl, and sectioned off the apartment again into their 'base camps' from the introduction phase. From what I can tell neither cat is hurt and no fur has gone flying but I want to be safe.

Is this a ""cats will be cats"" scenario or is there something I can do to help them get along?

My concern right now is that we're supposed to go to my parents' in the morning and spend the week there for Christmas. Cali hasn't explored their house too far beyond the front room (our ""bedroom"") and a bit of the dining room (funny story CB would sometimes sit/lay in front of the front room door and almost 'gatekeep' the hallway from Cali) but I'm concerned if this chasing/fighting continues in a bigger house it may be harder for me to keep an eye on them and separate them if things get rough. 

We're actually supposed to move back in with them next month (I lost my job last month, not important tho) so I was curious if there was any way I could help them sort thibgs out before the move?",1,1766386262.0,CatAdvice,0,1.0,False

🧠 Mindset (read first)

Be curious, not outcome-focused

Calm > clever

One short interaction is a win

Respect beats confidence tricks

---

👀 Before You Approach (5-second check)

Eye contact happened? ✅

She looks relaxed / not rushing? ✅

No headphones / not deep on phone? ✅ If 2+ are ❌ → don’t approach

---

🚶‍♂️ How to Walk Up

Side angle, not straight-on

Stop 1–1.5 arm lengths away

Relax shoulders, small smile

Hands visible, voice calm

---

🗣️ Openers (pick ONE)

Direct & respectful

“Hey—quick hi. I saw you and wanted to say hello.”

Situational (best odds)

“Is this place always this busy?”

“That drink looks good—what is it?”

Specific compliment (choice, not body)

“Your jacket’s cool—where’d you get it?”

“That book looks interesting. Worth it?”

---

🔁 Follow-Ups (keep it flowing)

“How’d you get into that?”

“What do you like most about it?”

“Would you recommend it?”

---

🧩 What to Say NEXT (light + human)

Share one short thing about you

“I’m new to this place.”

“I’m trying to read more this year.”

Then ask another question

---

❌ Avoid

Lines rehearsed too hard

Comments on her body

Over-explaining yourself

Blocking her path

---

🚦 Interest Check (30–60 seconds)

Green: asks back, smiles, faces you Yellow: polite but short answers Red: turns away, no questions

---

🧍‍♀️ Graceful Exits (always classy)

“Nice chatting—enjoy your day!”

“I’ll let you get back to it. Take care.”

---

📲 If It’s Going Well (optional)

“I’ve enjoyed this—want to grab coffee sometime?”

“Mind if I get your Instagram""

The day you hit my arm and we almost crashed into the wall . We were just playing around. We were in love, not a care in the world our feature was endless. In that moment, I looked over at you, smiling from ear to ear had the radio on Bob and we in the seat where you fixed your make up? While I was watching you, I asked you a simple question. I said hey do you talk to your ex anymore? Are you guys good friends? And remember that moment we were just talking about your face, went blank and said he will never speak to me again I made sure of it.

silly me in love, but knew that was fucked off. What the fuck did she mean so here’s the backstory I was married first stage of separation you knew you were getting kicked out of your apartment. All the bills are due and that money you got you spent like wildfire. It’s the same pattern with youM . we grind and busted our ass for years well you kind of sit back but we’d be cleaning the house or doing a project in the yard. The kids were over. We would on vacation. are crazy ass birthday at the ski resort that we could buy whatever we wanted to at any time and feel OK all those years. A fight here and there but love making words should I think we did that for a while fought just the fuck. Nothing ever serious. But periodically these times I have seen you take no accountability for your actions. I have seen you run off your own children. Your mom and dad at first, but I’ve seen been your extended family every one of your friends besides we know. But the foul shit that came out of your fucking mouth. 

The constant fucking I hate everybody. I can’t get along with people.  We make friendships some more some didn’t but it’s funny. I was always you fucking with somebody. Running everybody off and you said it was me. You can weave every story in the world, but line everybody up just one timeline everybody up and let them tell their story for years you danced in circles. This is the best life you ever had? The greatest husband to my loving husband. The greatest paw.paw then you threw that poison on us. I knew better I told you I didn’t drink alcohol, but you were like let’s just have fun so I love you. I want to have fun with you. I didn’t know you’ve been cheating since 2000 your own words, your own letters was I mistaken to fucking not see that so busy trying to build that fucking castle in the air for you, you fool me he folded everybody and for a little bit of money and some tools and a car. So you can do drugs for a year and now tell everybody you’re sober and on the right path why don’t you just stay on the right path that’s weird oh, because I made your life miserable you just cannot stand the darkness right the darkness you kept me in. I am not the greatest human being in the world. I am not the greatest husband. I am not the best father but for these little fucking tales you tell and why do you have to tell everybody you’re like trying to push this narrative don’t let me put all these fucking letters out all these handwritten notes with that fucking evil you spit into the air some of that shit you written down bye-bye m2 to 5 and you wanna say I was in faithful I didn’t talk to women. I didn’t look at women. It was only you but the accusing every day to creating pictures. I still have them. Don’t worry cause you were doing shit.

1pssucg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thailand/comments/1pssucg/my_motorcycle_license_process_chiang_mai_202526/,My Motorcycle License Process - Chiang Mai - 2025/26,"Ok, so I just got my motorcycle license from scratch in Chiang Mai and here is the process.

I did not have a driving license from back home, so this was a full new license. I did not use a driving school, just the normal process for thai people.

First of all, the process takes 3 days, but I waited 3 weeks between delivering the documents and getting exam dates. I believe you can skip the wait with a driving school.

** Gathering and delivering documents **

I needed to gather and deliver the following:

- Residence Certificate
- Health Certificate
- Copies of Passport and Visa 
- Photo

I got the residence certificate from a visa agent in Nimman for 2000 thb, I think it took 2 days, maybe it was only one full day.

I got the health certificate in a clinic in the Old Town, near the northern gate. He took blood pressure and that was it. I forgot the cost, but a few hundred baht.

You can make copies of your passport and visa in the DLT.

Forgot if they took the photo or if I had it somewhere else.

** Exam day 1 - video watching and reaction test **

Day 1 begins at 9 am with video watching, you will receive a date after which you can attend. This might be in the future like it was for me. Be there around 8.30 or so. 

The video watching is very boring and consists of subbed thai instruction videos about traffic laws and whatnot. 2 hours before lunch and then 1 hour after lunch. That was for us, but some say it can last longer.

After the second video watching, we did the reaction test with go-stop on car pedals. Not difficult.

Then the foreigners had to watch another video better produced with some rules and laws again stated.

** Exam day 2 - driving test and theory test **

The test begins at 9 am, but opens at 8.30 for registration (be there 8.30), it’s behind the building to the right.

You MUST bring your scooter was what I was told. The drive to the DLT is not difficult from Nimman or Old Town but practice it first. It took me 20 mins from the Huay road 

The test consists of driving through a half circle of cones first, where you have to use your signal, first right, then left.

Then you stop at some cones on a line and have to slalom them, which I found slightly difficult, but I think most find it easier than what comes next.

The next is the infamous plank balance, which is a 25cm or wide line with cones on either side, that you have to drive through slowly without losing balance or putting down feet. It has to be done for 10 seconds (no less), but in reality it seems to be 5 seconds or so. I guess it depends.

I passed in the first go, despite not having ridden in 15 years, but I did ride a bit in the days up to it, so thats something I recommend.

Then a break and theory test begins at 10am and remember to put your documents and passport in the box next to the room, so you get called up along with the rest.

** The theory test **

The theory test is both confusing and easy. The translations in various online tests is usually poor or wrong, leading to confusion. However I scored a 50/50 perfect score in only 10 minutes (you have 60 minutes).

I highly recommend you use the ThaiDriveExam.com, which came recommended from the DLT office stapled to my documents.

The key here is to just keep doing it until you get a passing grade every time (45/50). The questions are VERY similar to the exam questions, but translated worse with google translate. However, as I say, just keep doing it until you keep passing for like 5-10 times in a row.

Some good things to remember for the exam:

- Vehicles to the left has right of way / priority in an intersection
- Vehicles turning right has priority over vehicles turning left into the same lane
- The main road has priority over the minor road

As I said, I was worried I wouldn’t make it, because I am a bit autistic and ADHD and frequently misunderstood what was asked. Pay extra attention to if they ask what you should do or what you shouldn’t do etc.

** Waiting and taking photo **

After I passed both tests, the time was only 10.30 or so and I went to the information desk and got a number. Then I had to wait for 1 hour or so until called up to confirm the info on the documents. Then I had to go wait 20 minutes or so in a line to take a photo. When I had the photo taken, I then got the printed driving license right, which was cool, but the license is kind of low quality plastic, but it was fast, so no complaining.

** Conclusion **

It was fairly stressful, mostly because I didn’t know the process, but overall easy. I will say though, you will NOT pass the theory test if you don’t study for it. The driving test is easy, but if you’re legit a noob at driving, then go practise that as well.

Overall as a foreigner I was treated well and they take care of you albeit in a brusque public employee way.

Experience was 9/10, can’t complain about a driving license for 105 baht (cost of photo) and in 2 days, sure beats the $3000 for one in my own country and months spent.

The 1/10 detraction is for the lack of food and water options. I highly recommend bringing water as the video room is hot. You can buy water and some coffee-ish drink in the parking lot as well as some deep fried sausages of a sort.

Then dry each nail to make sure no extra water. Make my coffee. Then dry hands again & buff nails. Do not brush , just blow any dust away. To me, the glue sticks better to the rougher nails. Choose each nail for each finger& lay aside. I use Ibd 5 second nail glue. Cover my whole finger nail with a touch extra in the middle. Press the nails going toward but not on the cuticle. Hold tight & rock pressure back n forth, for 20 seconds just to be sure. Then I add just a drop of glue in between my nail & press on. Hold 20 seconds again. Starting later at night, I add a drop of cuticle oil. And that’s all! Mine will stay on almost 3 weeks. I’m careful not to use nails to open things, extra pressure on them, etc. this also helps my nails grown out also. Maybe give it a try???

39/M/US here. Finding myself awake at a time much later than normal, and no…it isn’t because I ate Chipotle too late and I’m suffering the consequences. 

I’ve posted on this subreddit, and others like it, for several weeks to little fanfare. This doesn’t mean I haven’t had some great people reach out, it simply means I haven’t found the type of person I seek. 

I find the art of wordplay very romantic; finding new ways to convey thoughts, feelings, emotions, and make yourself stand out are all very important to me. I feel like I’ve shorted myself for nearly 40 years - not showing many people who I am and what I’m about. I genuinely want to change this. 

I’ve always been the “fun guy”. The best friend. The second lead male in all your favorite romance books. The guy who brings the comedic relief but also drops the nugget of wisdom that makes the MMC confess his true feelings to the coffee shop owner (our FMC). 
I’m more than that, though. I am far from the smartest or the most interesting man in the room but I feel I offer quite a bit. 
I can entertain you with tales of my days as a newspaper columnist, as a former stand-up comedian, or as the guy at work who impressed everyone with his ability to kick his leg far above his head. 

I’ve been accused of being AI…of using AI…of being a “bot”, but nothing could be further from the truth. 

Case in point? I’m awake contemplating the holidays. I lost my mom during this time of year 10 + years ago and though I have found that time does make things easier, I always miss her the most during the holidays. It’s far too easy to feel sorry for myself and really let all the ugly cries out when it’s late and quiet and I have nothing but memories to carry me to the daylight. 

Who am I? I’m a reader. A writer. A lover of laughs. A man who can probably eat an entire cake in one sitting (as long as it’s buttercream frosting and not that hippy dippy whipped crap). I’m a brother and a son to parents who are both no longer on this earth. I’m an uncle, a boss, a stranger, the guy you make eye contact with in line at the movie theater and look at your date and say, “that guys looks like he would know good movies”.

I’m looking for a friend. Someone to share wins and cry over losses with. Someone who can speak the language of humor, music, and stupid movie quotes. 

I’m complex. Emotionally intelligent. Self-aware. I have a billion ideas and not one single ounce of gumption to make any of those ideas a reality. I skate by with charm and charisma and lots of favors requested. 

Flawed. Nerdy. Heckin’ chonker. That’s me. I’ll turn you on to great life hacks, new hobbies, and kick-ass music. I’ll also listen to all your problems and carry your sadness as my own. I’ll make you laugh and think. I’ll make you wish you had some snacks. 

Come join me on something that I have a hard time describing - a friendship. A connection. A relationship. I can only sell myself so many ways (go check out the plethora of posts in my profile… I’ve tried it all).

I've hit the point on galleries where grinding for better artifacts is really starting to get diminishing returns (Like hunting for the exact same substats, but as a 4 liner instead of 3):

1psslh6,https://i.redd.it/smwoeoye9p8g1.jpeg,How I made my student accommodation feel like home as an international student,"Moving countries for uni is exciting, but also overwhelming. It’s not just lectures and deadlines. It’s figuring out how to feel at home with two suitcases and a heart full of hope 

A few small things genuinely helped me settle in:

**Personalise your space early-** Photos from home, my favourite bed-sheet, and my spider man mug made me feel less temporary.

**Build a simple routine-** Making your bed, morning coffee, regular meals, and short walks nearby create comfort when everything else feels new.

**Give yourself time-** Feeling “at home” doesn’t happen overnight. It took me months, and that’s completely normal. I acknowledged that deeply and embraced that rather than being hard on myself.

**Use social spaces-** Even short chats in shared areas help reduce loneliness and make the place feel more human. 

**Keep your room organised-** Clutter adds stress, especially in a new country. A tidy space really helps your headspace.

Choosing student accommodation isn’t just about location or price. Feeling safe and settled makes everything else easier.

I’m curious, what helped you feel less lonely when you first moved abroad as an international student? Or what do you wish you’d done sooner?

1psslfr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1psslfr,My Nelson & Murdock Modular MOC is finally complete!,"After tons of Bricklink orders, and hours of trial and error, I’m happy to say I’m finally happy enough with this build to put it in the city. I was heavily inspired by Tobi-casts amazing Nelson and Murdock, and took tons of design cues from it. 

I wanted to challenge myself to keep the height and shape of the OG Deli set intact, but add lots more detail. I managed to fit more shelves, and a drink cooler in, and still feel like there’s plenty of room to move around.

Challenge #2, incorporating the Homecoming Bank. Im sad I had to remove the exploding safe gimmick, but had to nix it for space. Added a bit more detail on the ATMs and tiled the floor. 

First floor is the lobby, deli, and bank. 2nd floor is Nelson and Murdock office and a New York apartment, and 3rd floor is Fogwells Gym (waiting on decals from Friendly Neighborhood crafts!)

This project has taken me weeks and I’m happy to finally put it to bed. This is my first full modular moc and I couldn’t be happier with the results. I hope you enjoy it too!

1pssiu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/1pssiu7/what_actually_makes_a_coffee_table_book_feel/,What actually makes a coffee table book feel minimal?,"I’ve been thinking a lot about coffee table book design lately, and how “minimal” can mean very different things depending on who’s looking at it.

Some books feel calm, intentional, and expensive with very few images per spread. Others use more photos but still manage to feel balanced and uncluttered. On the flip side, some books technically follow minimalist rules but end up feeling sparse or unfinished.

So I’m curious how people here think about it:

* Is minimal more about **page count**, **image density**, or **pacing**?
* Does white space always help, or can it sometimes work against the book?
* Are there coffee table books you think get this balance especially right?

1pssi4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/fican/comments/1pssi4h/some_tips_i_use/,Some tips I use,"Earlier this week I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/fican/comments/1ppi5dw/im_proud_of_my_unflashy_savings_journey_this_year/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) about how I was am a 40 year old tradesperson making 80-90k per year and I saved more this year than I ever have before. I had wanted to share as something different from all the posts that are totally out of touch with the average person like me. I have about 80k left on my mortgage and about 20k left on a car loan. Other than that I have no other debt. My wife makes a little less than I do and she saves as much or more than I do but this year I put almost 20k into RRSP and TFSA accounts. I wanted to share with all of you some of the tips and tricks we use to help save and keep our budget on track.

1. I don't buy large items on a whim. I take the time to research a little, look for deals, decide if it is something I actually need at all. When I decide it is something I need I wait for deals. I don't pay full price period. Wether it is a table saw or a TV or a new set of tires. I wait for deals.

  
2. To add to that, When the time comes that I am buying anything and they tell you something along the lines of ""hey, if you get another, you will get it for half price"" you aren't saving half the cost, you are spending half as much more than you intended. 

  
3. Find the best credit card you can with some sort of rewards on it and use that for your day to day purchases BUT make sure you pay it off in full each month. Currently I am using my Rogers World Bank mastercard which pays 2% cash back but if you use that towards your Rogers bill, they will make it 3%. This is saving me a nice amount of money monthly on my rogers bill.

  
4. Take a lunch to work. Admittedly, I do usually eat out on fridays but I save the rest of the time. To start, I brew my morning coffee at home. This saves $1.50 each morning. I drink the coffee at work and rarely go out to get another which is an additional $2 a day saved. I don't drink soda anyway but I do drink water. I never ever buy bottled water, I bring a water bottle I filled up at home and I will refill it out of the water cooler or fountain. This saves a lot especially when I watch my coworker drinking 2 or 3 redbull a day he buys for 5 bucks each at the gas station.

  
5. Along with bringing lunch each day, we usually look at the sales and plan out a weekly menu for supper that makes good on some of the sales. We rarely buy premade foods and we grow vegetables in the summer. We tend to eat vegeatarian 2 or 3 days a week which seems to be a bit healthier anyway. 

  
6. In my particular case, I have a vehicle for work and a gas card for it. I have a loyalty card and collect points on the gas my company pays for. In fact, I have loyalty cards for practically everywhere that I keep in my google wallet (I don't bother with the ones I have to carry a physical card for) Any chance I can earn points or cash back on things I have to buy, I do it. Renting hotel rooms when I am on the road, only where there is a loyalty program and I only rent rooms with kitchenettes in them so I can make my own food, avoiding eating fast food, and keeping most of my per diems which I usually put into rrsp and tfsa when I get them.

  
7. As I worked my way through the apprenticeship program, I got raises at each level. As I got each raise, I increased the percentage of my pay that went to retirement accounts. Now that I make more than I spend, if I get a raise, the entirety of it will go to retirement accounts. What I have learned is that if you make more money, you will find a way to spend it. I choose to spend it on my future, not my present.

  
8. We have an RESP set up for our daughter. The entirety of the child benefit we recieve goes into this account. This is around 2k. We always make sure to put in enough to top it up to 2500 annually as the government will pay 20% up contributions, up to $500 each year. Thats a lot of free money that will help your kid. Make sure you take them up on it.

  
9. I don't pay people to do things to my house I can do myself. I needed a new shed, I built it. I needed windows replaced, I replaced them myself. I've refinished doors, replaced doors, replaced flooring, insulated the attic, reshingled the roof, replaced the fence, replaced the front steps, drywalled, plastered, painted, built floating shelves, built ins, installed new shower surrounds, replaced a dishwasher and the list goes on and on. Each year we pick a few projects and do them outselves or with the help of friends and family. We haven't had to finance any of the things we have done and we have been able to do them affordably.

  
I still like to have fun and I defintely spend money on some hobbies and I like to have a few beer now and then but I prioritize paying for my future first. 



When we bought a house we found a little spot that the price was right. At the time we were preapproved for a much larger mortgage than we would have wanted to take on. We erred on the side of a smaller home that was a bit older. While lots of people we know sold their houses, some multiple times, each time basically restarting their mortgages, we kept ours and we will be mortgage free in 5 or 6 more years, having paid off our 25 year mortgage in 21 years. It helps to realize the difference between wants and needs and prioritize according to what is important to you. I hope there was some decent information in here for you all. Again, I can't say strongly enough, measure you success against yourself, not what everyone else is doing and appreciate your successes while being honest with yourself.

1pssgu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1pssgu7/clients_want_minimal_coffee_table_books_but_keep/,Clients want “minimal” coffee table books… but keep asking to add more photos. How do you handle this?,"I design coffee table books, and this keeps coming up again and again.

Clients say they want a *minimal, high-end, coffee table style book,* lots of white space, calm layouts, editorial feel. All good. That’s my preference too.

But once we start curating, it turns into:

* “Can we add just one more photo here?”
* “This one *has* to be included.”
* “What if we fit two images on this page instead of one?”
* “The book feels a bit short, can we add more?”

Before I know it, the minimal concept starts slipping into something much denser, and I’m stuck trying to protect the design without sounding stubborn or precious.

I’ve tried:

* Explaining pacing and visual breathing room
* Showing references of high-end coffee table books
* Doing side-by-side comparisons

Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t.

For other designers / photographers / print folks-how do you manage this? Do you set hard limits early? Let it play out and show why it doesn’t work? Or just accept that “minimal” means different things to different clients?",1,1766384509.0,photography,3,1.0,False
