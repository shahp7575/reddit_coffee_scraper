So I went home took a two hour nap woke up feeling refreshed still craving the nicotine but not nearly as bad as before. I feel like I got past the very peak of the withdrawals yesterday. I woke up this morning and I have a lot more sleep, my brain isn’t as foggy, I’m more alert, still have the cravings, but not nearly as strong. I am still using coffee pouches as a substitute but I will be cutting out those as well.

1lun23t,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1lun23t/when_did_you_realize_this_was_an_american_religion/,When did you realize this was an American religion?,"For me, it wasn't exactly a lightbulb moment, but rather a gradual progression. I grew up as a JW and in a country that was mostly Christian (even if many people didn't actually really go to church that much). Going out knocking on doors mostly had me come across people saying they were catholic or some form of protestant (JWism aside). However, it wasn't until I spent a good 10 years or so in two foreign language fields that catered to non-Christian populations that made me start to see this is an American religion.

First, our whole service approach falls apart when the person we meet at the door isn't a Christian (or coming from that kind of a background). I remember using the suggested presentations to read such and such a scripture and being met with a polite response and zero interest. At one point, people who were in the field in my circuits just thought it was because they had never heard of Jesus before, but when asked many said ""yeah, heard of him, seems like a neat story but I'm (buddhist/daoist/muslim). 

We'd do lots of research into the WT literature to figure how to approach the ministry better but it was never really that effective. The magazines just taught us to throw random scriptures at people and hope they made an impression. Sometimes it did, but it often never really progressed past ""neat"" for people in these fields. 

In the first field, we actually did have a lot of studies but basically all of them were ""interested"" in the religion beacuse it seemed exotic and because from their perspective, they were chilling with new friends. Like, you might invite someone out for coffee a few times before ever bringing up the Bible. Eventually when they were reeled in though, it often fell apart because again, the problems or questions they would pose were different than what the GB was prepared for. Or maybe an article touched on an issue they were having but again, because there wasn't a Christian background, the answers didn't really make sense to them. 

The second field was similar as well. We'd try reading say, Revelation 21:4 or Jeremiah 29:11, to them and they'd say ""yeah, I don't believe in Revelations"" and then it'd be like, crap what do I do? The WT just says to read this scripture and it will be a good result.  Then there would be the questions like ""why do important people for your religion all come from America if this isn't an American religion?"".

At first I ignored it, but then I heard a talk. The speaker was a local and he said ""In the East we tend to believe that people from stories are worthy of worship, but as God's people we know that is not something that Jehovah believes in. We know that only the Bible can be trusted"" and then all my service experiences started to click for me. Yes, the GB trains us to view other religions as a storybook, but most of our logic can be flipped back on us too. A Buddhist could easily call the Bible a storybook as well. Conversions are often low among people of other faiths for this reason I think. After all, 99% of our literature is aimed at correcting issues that the GB believes exists in other Christian sects, but they honestly have no idea what to do with people from non-Christian backgrounds. 

I think this is also why they shifted to the whole ""we don't need to talk about the Bible, befriend them, love bomb then, and then convert them"" approach. ",2,1751977085.0,exjw,0,1.0,False

Living with TBI means facing challenges that often don’t have easy fixes. The big stuff—memory, fatigue, identity—can feel overwhelming and out of reach.

But sometimes, it’s the small daily annoyances—the little things that pile up—that sap our energy. What if those had their own fixes? Maybe silly, maybe imaginary, but maybe they help us breathe a little easier.

Welcome to the **Department of Easy Fixes**, a playful look at the everyday problems that plague us, and the quirky solutions that might just make life less complicated.

Here are a few favorites:

* **One Standard Deviation™**: Smart devices that don’t make you feel stupid.
* **The Dishwasher Demystifier™**: A dishwasher that empties itself. No more wrestling wet dishes or playing kitchen Tetris.
* **The Spice Rack Simplifier™**: A spice rack where cinnamon isn’t hiding behind a dozen mystery jars.
* **The Smart Trash Sorter™**: Automatically sorts your trash—no guessing where the coffee filter goes.
* **The Tiny Print Repealer™**: Magic glasses that make tiny print instantly readable.

And for the days when nothing feels right:

* **The Existential Alarm Clock™**: Only wakes you for things that actually matter. Settings: “Today,” “Someday,” and “Never.”

Some days, no gadget can fix the big stuff. On those days, we honor the try — and each other.

Because sometimes, the smallest wins are the ones that keep us going.

1lumzms,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1lumzms/my_partner_wants_to_constantly_have_long_talks/,My partner wants to constantly have long talks about emotions and it is becoming exhausting,"I (32M) have been with my partner (25M) for about a year. Early on he let me know that he has suffered a lot of trauma, both physical and emotional from everyone around him - his parents, bullies, past friends, exes etc. Almost all our physical dates included long periods of him telling me about his bad experiences. I always felt horrible and tried to reassure him that I would never do those things and that my worst quality according to most is my stubbornness. I never get physical in arguments, I try to not be manipulative (some times I catch myself slipping), I am (almost brutally) honest and generally think that if you don't like someone, you should cut ties with them (which I have done with multiple people, friends and family).

After a while we had to go LDR because of my job in another country. When we facetimed, he'd often be in a bad mood. It was usually some argument with his parents, which ruined his mood for the rest of the day. As he was already distressed, he'd be more snappy with me, which resulted in a lot of arguments along the LDR months. After an argument, I noticed that he would always need long, exhausting conversations, which would go in circles in order to feel like the argument had been solved. Even if I told him I understood his perspective and I would try to improve my attitude, he'd still sulk and say he didn't feel satisfied and that he wanted the conversation to last longer.

Lately, it's become a bigger issue. We're currently non-LDR, as I've returned to my folks for the summer, and he will always try to be upset about something. The list of the triggers (in no particular order, non-exhaustive) of the past few months have been:

* Me not doing something minor he wanted in a video game we play together
* My mum's meal prep food tastes too ""frozeny"" and he'd rather starve
* Me telling him to prepare something else if he didn't like the existing food
* Me asking him to make me a coffee when he was making his
* My mum coming in the house (we live in the same building, but not apartment) to pick up something of hers
* The phone ringing
* My ex asking me something about work (we worked together in an ongoing project)
* My dreams
* His dreams
* Me telling him to stop wasting water/electricity (bills double when he's around, even though we're 3 and with him 4)
* The sea being kinda murky
* Soup too watery

One main issue is that whenever we talk, if I try to talk about my side, he will always try to inject something irrelevant about how my actions hurt him so that we never discuss my point. It has to be about him, it has to be him that has been mistreated, misjudged and attacked, and my experience is trivial in front of his insurmountable issues, such as his socks having a hole. It doesn't help that he's always misinterpreting my words because he's struggling with using and understanding language (he's told me it's because of his high school trauma). He's using wrong words and understanding my words incorrectly, but we've worked on that somewhat and I correct him so that our conversations make sense.

As you can guess, I have come to a breaking point regarding conversations about his feelings. They feel like punishment, since they must never be quick, the solution must not be provided early on and it needs to drag till Daylight savings time ends. As I mentioned earlier, even if I do everything right and I say all the right things, he will not be satisfied if it ends too quickly. Me trying to avoid the endless conversations has had some kind of conditioning effect on him, and even if we do talk he'll keep it in the back of his mind and he'll try to start a new conversation with the same issue when we are not in an argument, so that he feels satisfied with the length we've talked about the issue.

I've attempted to offer compromises, such as he can talk non-stop if he so wishes, but if I don't have something to offer I will just let him speak, or if I have an issue with something he does, I get to talk about it, but he can't bring up an irrelevant issue, so that our talk does not focus on him. He's been able to do this once or twice, but I can see from his attitude afterwards that he doesn't like not getting to do the talking. I know these are not ideal, but I am not a talker. For me an argument is solved when the initial problem is solved and the angry emotions subside. For him an argument is solved with at least 2-3 hours of talking, even if we are still angry and the issue persists.

Advice?

TL;DR: My boyfriend is always upset by something and wants to talk about it extensively. He struggles with expression and often misunderstands or miscommunicates, but it has become obvious that he wants the conversations to end only after he has been satisfied, and only if it means he was right. I am fed up with those conversations, he will not compromise with shorter ones or solutions.",1,1751976875.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **UEFA Champions League Qualification: FC Iberia 1999 vs. Malmö FF**  
**Date:** July 8, 2025 | **Time:** 16:00 UTC | **Venue:** TBC

---

### The Setup: A David vs. Goliath of Eastern Europe and Scandinavia

FC Iberia 1999 (Georgia) enters this clash as the plucky underdog, fresh off a **2024 Erovnuli Liga title**—a feat akin to a Georgia Bulldogs team winning the SEC in the 1980s. Malmö FF (Sweden), the defending Allsvenskan champions, are the seasoned veterans, but their Europa League struggles this season have left them with the swagger of a man who’s had one too many espressos.

The bookmakers aren’t pulling any punches: **Malmö is a -150 favorite**, while Iberia is a +500 underdog. That’s like betting on a man who once won a chess match against a tree. But hey, the tree had a good defense.

---

### The Numbers Game: Implied Probabilities vs. Underdog Rates

Let’s crunch the numbers with the precision of a spreadsheet-obsessed intern on Red Bull.

* **Malmö (-150):** Implied probability = **60%** (150/(150+100)).
* **Iberia (+500):** Implied probability = **16.7%** (100/(500+100)).
* **Underdog Win Rate in Soccer:** **41%** (per your data).

**Expected Value (EV) for Iberia:**  
EV = (Underdog Win Rate × Payout) – (Implied Probability × Stake)  
= (41% × 6.0) – (16.7% × 1)  
= **2.46 – 0.167 = 2.293** (per $1 bet).

That’s a **229% ROI** if Iberia pulls off the shocker. Malmö’s EV? A pedestrian **(60% × 1.6) – (40% × 1) = 0.56 – 0.4 = 0.16**. Not bad, but not worth the caffeine crash.

---

### Key Factors: Why Iberia Might Just Pull It Off

1. **Home Advantage?**  
Iberia’s home field is in Tbilisi, Georgia—population: 1.2 million. Malmö’s home field is in Sweden. Let’s just say the altitude in Tbilisi might give Malmö’s forwards the same energy as a gluten-free muffin.
2. **Malmö’s Europa League Blues**  
The Swedes have looked like a team that forgot to charge their laptops in European competitions this season. Their **Europa League record**: 1W-2L-1D in qualifiers. Not exactly inspiring.
3. **Iberia’s Title-Winning Edge**  
Winning the Georgian league isn’t just about skill—it’s about surviving ambushes by fans who throw pickled cabbage instead of confetti. That kind of mental toughness? It translates to European nights.

---

### The Playbook: Best Bets & Witty Recommendations

**1. Iberia 1999 to Win (+500)**

* **Why:** The EV is astronomical. At 41% chance vs. 16.7% implied, this is the equivalent of betting on a snowball to survive in a sauna. But hey, sometimes the sauna’s just not on.
* **Payout Potential:** A $100 bet nets **$500** if Iberia wins. That’s enough to buy a small Georgian wine cellar.

**2. Both Teams to Score (2.04 Odds)**

* **Why:** Malmö’s attack is inconsistent, but Iberia’s defense? Let’s just say they’re not the New England Patriots’ D-line. The **2.04 line** implies a 50% chance of both scoring. With Malmö’s shaky defense and Iberia’s title-winning offense, this feels like a coin flip with a 50% chance of landing on its edge.

**3. Avoid the Spread**

* Malmö is -1.0 in most books. That’s like betting on a Ferrari to beat a go-kart on a racetrack… but the go-kart’s driver is named *NASCAR*. Stick to the moneyline.

---

### Final Verdict: Bet on the Underdog, But Don’t Cry Over Spilled Coffee

While Malmö is the safer pick on paper, **Iberia 1999 offers the best EV** and a shot at glory. If you’re feeling spicy, stack it with **Both Teams to Score** for a 2.04× multiplier.

**Final Prediction:**

* **Iberia 1999 1-1 Malmö FF** (Both teams score, Iberia advances on aggregate).
* **Best Bet:** Iberia 1999 to win outright at +500.

*“In the end, it’s not the size of the dog in the fight, but the size of the fight in the dog. And Iberia? They’ve got the fight of a man who’s been told his Netflix is about to cut off.”* — *The Handicapper’s Guide to Eastern Europe* 🇬🇪🇸🇪

i'm going to list some things that she does because i can't really describe it without using examples:

every conversation has to come back to something about her. if i'm insecure about something then it's an insecurity i inherited off her and she talks about herself. if i'm worried about something then she'll ignore it and talk about a loosely related worry she's had. i told her i finished my book yesterday and instead of asking me if i enjoyed it or anything like that she just detailed the whole plot of the book she was reading. i said i was proud because ive read almost 20 books this year and she said ""i bet ive read more pages than you though"". i told her i was worried that my friend is moving away and i won't see her as much and she said that when she left uni she didn't stay in contact with any of her friends and that this was my dad's fault and then talked about her relationship with my dad. these aren't just one off examples, this is every conversation.

everytime she talks about work it's about how she is the best person at her job or how people tell her how amazing she is at her job. it seems like every day someone tells her that she is better than all her colleagues at her job. she's a doctor and thinks this demands more respect than other jobs. i'm at medical school and she often tells me that my grades (already pretty high) are lower than the grades she got. she did some volunteering work recently and got appointed team leader for a project and every conversation comes back to how everyone tells her she's the best team leader and how other people's ideas are wrong and her's are correct and that's why she's the team leader.

she is critical of Everyone. strangers are annoying and self centered. she assumes everyone has bad intentions and is judging her. her colleagues are irritating (for doing things like talking about their kids or holidays), people on the TV are unlikeable because of the way they dress, young girls are annoying and vapid. she criticised someone's body the other day and i asked her to please not. she apologised and then said ""but i do it because it's a trauma response because my brother called me fat as a child"" and then continued doing it again.

i have panic attacks (and have done since i was 11) and she used to be very good at handling these but now if they happen she says ""please don't do that it makes me feel bad, it makes me feel like i've done something wrong, i don't know how to deal with it.""

she doesn't listen to anything I say. the other day we went for coffee and i said ""let's go to coffee shop A"". she ignored me and looked at google maps and then goes ""how about coffee shop A. it gets better reviews than coffee shop B and C"". 

i'm back for summer break (6 weeks) and went to stay with a friend for a few nights as well as going away with my boyfriend for a week. she told me she never sees me so could i not arrange to see friends again.

i feel like im invisible and she doesn't care about me at all. she's impossible to criticise and will say things like ""well i'm just an awful person then"" or make an excuse about how she was traumatised by an event in her life and that's why she has to talk about herself/ put other people down. she won't take responsibility for any of her actions and makes excuses for everything. i do love her and we like doing things together. i feel guilty for feeling these things about her because i do believe that she cares about me. she calls me weekly at uni and we went on a nice holiday together this summer. i don't know what im meant to do. i can't really fathom bringing it up to her but it makes me not want to talk to her so i feel like im stuck. anyone been in a similar situation?

tldr: my mum makes everything about herself and is displaying self obsessive qualities. i feel like she doesn't care about me but don't know how to bring it up as i know she wont react well. need advice.",1,1751976641.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

**$650** **- VFC BCM Jack Carbine 16"" Custom AEG + extras -** [https://imgur.com/a/D2KSYFK](https://imgur.com/a/D2KSYFK)

* **Built by Dave at Airsoft Depot**
* **Newly added Haley Strategic & BCM HSP J8654B6 markings on front and back of receiver**
* **Newly added BCM markings on flash hider**
* ACM EO 552 and B5 crane stock included, what you see is what you get
* 16"" barrel with Prometheus 6.03mm inner barrel pre-installed
* 4uad bucking pre-installed
* Custom Disruptive Grey cerakote finish
* Deep engrave BCM receiver markings
* True 1:1 clone of BCM Jack Carbine, **one of a kind custom build**
* This is an AEG, eletric rifle with metal gearbox

**$350** **- Cyma Platinum MP5 AEG (CM041H) - Asia Model -** [https://imgur.com/a/CO2dBr6](https://imgur.com/a/CO2dBr6)

* Purchased back in 2021, has been used in a few games, wired to Deans
* FPS is capped at 370 FPS, perfect for indoor and outdoor games
* eShooter Kestrel V2 Bluetooth programmable mosfet installed, since the stock mosfet died after a year of use. Kestrel has been tuned by Dave from Airsoft Depot
* 4x additional plastic mags included + 1x original mag that came in the box
* Clone MS2 OD sling and RSA sling adapter included
* One metal M-lok rail adapter included
* The MP5 has a QD latched flash hider with a hidden 14mm CCW threaded barrel beneath it for tracer units or mock suppressors
* Original box and manual included

This rifle has been used in both indoor and outdoor games and has been well taken care of. It's a very snappy and responsive SMG with an impressive 50m effective range with 0.32g BBs. As with all programmable mosfets regardless of whether it's Kestrel, Gate, or Perun, please note it drains batteries fairly quickly. Around 450\~500 rounds in, you will have to plug in a new battery. Tested with HRG 11.1v 1100mAh LiPo.

Additionally, for some reason selector on full auto doesn't seem to register. Either the selector plate is misaligned or the Kestrel isn't intended for an MP5 shell. Regardless, I don't think this is a major issue since majority of fields enforce semi only anyway. You can program the SMG to shoot burst, binary, or full auto on the semi option if needed. I will also include the original packaging for the Kestrel upon selling.

Shooting video will be provided upon request.

**$15 - Czech ""Human Condom"" Rain Poncho - Size 2/XL, 1988 model -** [https://imgur.com/a/B31KGXL](https://imgur.com/a/B31KGXL)

1lumu1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1lumu1j/weight_loss_plateau/,Weight loss plateau,"Hi all,

Firstly I'd l like to state that I'm relatively new to weight loss. 

I'm not very active and I have adhd so it's difficult to focus on exercising. 

I started in May at 18st2 (254lbs) and am currently 17st0 (238lbs). My goal weight is 15st (210lbs). For the past two weeks or so I've not gone below 17st and my weight has remained around 17st0 and 17st2.

I am having meal replacement drinks (yfood/huel) for lunch and a normal dinner, plus banana, nectarine and orange as snacks. I have coffee, tea or low sugar squash as a drink. 

When I calculate my calories I'm below 1900 a day most days. A weight loss app tells me I am burning 2400 a day at my current weight. Yet I'm not actually loosing weight. I'm not sure what is happening. 
I have started to increase my movements by going for longer walks and aiming for 10k steps but often it's 5-7k. 

I also have quite a busy work and home life that reduce my availability to due set exercises. 

I know I need to move even more and be consistent but it has been difficult with events in my life. 

I'd like to know what else I can do to get weigh loss flowing again. 

Any advice is appreciated, thanks ",1,1751976403.0,WeightLossAdvice,0,1.0,False

Long story short, I have an issue with impulse shopping. I’ve racked up more debt than I could afford to pay in the past and am now so very close to paying it off. However, now that I’m almost there, I’m starting to slip again. By having to be disciplined for so long, I’m now “treating myself” with the extra money I have, though I should be saving it. 

I can recognize that I’m falling into old patterns and don’t want to jeopardize all of the progress I’ve made. I owe it to my husband (and myself!) to improve my financial habits so that we can work towards our mutual goals, one of them being saving for a down payment. Right now, I literally have 0 savings so I’m trying a no buy to hold myself accountable and kickstart a more frugal, intentional mentality.

Below is my outline. Starting tomorrow, I’m going to comment in this thread everyday confirming that I stuck to my goals and document my journey. Please feel free to interact or share your own check-ins and stories! 🤍

NO BUY JULY & AUGUST | July 9 - August 31

Personal Rules:
- No clothing, thrifting, jewelry, skincare/makeup/perfume, fast food, crafting or home goods purchases
- Reduce coffee runs to 1x a week 
- No online shopping, aside from groceries/essentials  

Exceptions:
- Experiences with friends and family. A lot of people in my life love to shop as an activity - if we’re doing that, I can spend a MAX of $50 for the day 
- Date nights / joint coffee runs with husband 
- Workout classes, health and wellness activities
- Hair and 1 summer pedicure 
- Groceries and replacements  

Goals:
- Pay off debt (roughly $2,500 remaining)
- Start building savings 
- Enjoy gratitude and appreciation for items I already have 
- Live more intentionally with less stress or personal pressure
- Support family’s mutual goals and growth
- Stop using store credit cards
- Prioritize health, wellness, learning and mindfulness
- Maximize time by reducing shopping and scrolling  ",3,1751976344.0,nobuy,1,1.0,False

The point of this is to either (re)learn tig on my old Harbor Freight special (220 machine) or buy a little 110 mig machine and learn with it. Goal is just piddling. Maybe some exhaust repair on my truck and making coffee tables etc....

Current setup:

* 100a service coming into the house, new panel, plenty of room there.
* 30a double pole breaker feeding shop sub panel.
* 50a double pole breaker in shop sub panel. Plenty of room here too. just one 15a for all lights and one 20a for all 110 outlets.
* Wire feeding the shop is #2 awg aluminum. Not sure of that matters, guess the contractor was cheaping out?  

Shop doesn't have a lot of draw. Not like I'd be using my table saw while welding and somehow drying my hair at the same time so I *think* it'll be OK but I wanted to ask the pros.

 Drop in a 20/30a double pole breaker in the sub panel and run a wire to a 220 plug then off to create some terrible welds?

Are there machines out there that get the milk hot/frothy enough for a true latte? Wife and I are not black coffee/espresso drinkers, for what its worth.

## Bahrain’s Business Environment in 2025: A Powerhouse for International Entrepreneurs

![Feature Image: Business environment in modern setting](https://images.pexels.com/photos/417332/pexels-photo-417332.jpeg)
*Alt text: Business environment in modern setting.**, Bahrain’s non-oil GDP grew by 5.1% over the past year, outpacing the GCC average. Forbes Business highlights the country’s ambitious 2025 Vision, with $45 billion in infrastructure and fintech development set for the next three years.

The Economic Development Board (EDB) reported over 1,300 new foreign companies registered in 2024 alone, a 17% increase year-on-year. Strategically located between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, with direct access to key Gulf markets, Bahrain’s pro-business environment features:

- **No personal or corporate income tax**
- A highly skilled, multicultural workforce
- World-class connectivity—think the new King Hamad Causeway project
- Transparent legal frameworks, with English widely used in business

The mood on the ground is energetic. In the Seef District, modern coworking spaces buzz with entrepreneurs. Bahrain Bay’s futuristic skyline is now home to regional divisions of Amazon, BNP Paribas, and new digital start-ups alike.

## Foreign Ownership Policies: 100% Foreign-Owned Companies in Bahrain

![Feature Image: Business structure and collaboration](https://images.pexels.com/photos/1181335/pexels-photo-1181335.jpeg)
*Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.*.* Regulatory reforms changed the scene—by 2022, Bahrain allowed 100% foreign ownership in most sectors, including trading, services, manufacturing, and technology.

### 2025 Policy Update: What’s New?

The Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Tourism (MOICT) announced in March 2025 that the list of “foreigner-friendly” business activities expanded again, now covering over 400 activities. [See the full list of 100% ownership allowed for foreigners.](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/)

However, some sensitive industries—such as oil extraction, certain telecoms, or media—still require Bahraini majority ownership or special approvals. Always check the **Sijilat** (the national company registry portal) for the latest status.

#### Best Bahrain Entity Types for Foreigners

Most foreign entrepreneurs choose:

- **With Limited Liability Company (WLL)**
- **Single Person Company (SPC)**
- **Branch of a Foreign Company**
- **Bahrain Free Zone Entity** (for 100% ownership with extra benefits)

Compare business types here: [Bahrain business type structures](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-business-type-structures/).

##### A Practical Example

When I set up my latest consultancy in the Diplomatic Area in late 2024, I registered as an SPC—enabling me to retain 100% ownership with a single shareholder structure. The online Sijilat portal recognized my activity code (consulting) as eligible for full foreign ownership. No local sponsor needed, and the process took only 6 working days.

*Note: If your planned business activity is still “restricted,” you may need a Bahraini partner ([read about 99% options and workarounds here](https://keylinkbh.com/99percent-foreign-ownership-in-bahrain/)), or consider a [local sponsorship](https://keylinkbh.com/local-sponsorship-in-bahrain/) model.*

---

## Bahrain vs. UAE & Saudi Arabia: Making the Winning Choice

A quick comparison with neighbors:

- **UAE:** Free zones offer 100% foreign ownership, but many “mainland” licenses still require a local service agent. Licensing costs and minimum office space requirements are usually higher in Dubai or Abu Dhabi.
- **Saudi Arabia:** Foreigners need a Saudi partner in most sectors, with high capital requirements and longer approval times.

Bahrain’s combination of *mainland* 100% foreign ownership, streamlined regulations, and flexible office solutions puts it ahead for many startups and regional HQs. And local business customs are refreshingly pragmatic: a handshake at a majlis can move things faster than a formal meeting (my favorite “insider” tip for real progress!).

## Business Formation Process: Step-by-Step, Insider’s Edition

![Feature Image: Business process and documentation](https://images.pexels.com/photos/3183170/pexels-photo-3183170.jpeg)
*Alt text: Business process and documentation.*:

### 1. Define Your Activity & Ownership Structure

*Check Sijilat for activity code eligibility ([or use Keylink’s free evaluation](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/)).*

**Tip:** Consulting, IT, trading, and most services qualify for 100% foreign ownership.

### 2. Prepare Your Documents

- Passport copies for all shareholders/directors
- Proof of address (utility bill or bank statement)
- CVs and educational certificates (for certain regulated professions)
- Business plan summary
- No Objection Certificate (if you’re already resident in Bahrain for another purpose)

*Shortcuts:*
- Pre-fill Sijilat online; avoid manual data re-entry.
- Upload high-resolution colored scans; blurry JPEGs will be rejected at MOICT counters.

### 3. Reserve Company Name via Sijilat

- Smartest to do this before 10am, especially on Sundays, to avoid application backlogs.
- Approved names are valid for 6 months.

### 4. Register at MOICT

- Submit application online via [Sijilat portal](https://keylinkbh.com/commercial-registration-in-bahrain/)
- Pay official fees (see cost breakdown below)
- Processing usually takes 5–8 working days
- Collect Commercial Registration (CR) certificate

### 5. Obtain Municipality Approval

*Depending on your office location (Seef’s new towers process permits faster than Manama’s historic souq blocks—personal lesson learned after waiting four extra days for a downtown address!).*

### 6. Register with LMRA & Open Bank Account

- Labor Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA) registration for work permits
- Open a corporate bank account (most banks require your physical presence)
- Some banks now offer expedited digital onboarding—ask at Bahrain Bay branches!

### 7. Additional Licenses

Sectors like finance, health, or education may need extra approvals. The EDB is extremely helpful—stop by their Diplomatic Area office for a quick coffee and guidance (they serve excellent cardamom-scented coffee and actually answer emails fast—a rarity regionally).

## Budget & Costs: What to Expect in 2025

![Feature Image: Financial planning and costs](https://images.pexels.com/photos/438637/)
*Alt text: Financial planning and costs.*

- **MOICT Registration Fees:** BHD 120–350
- **Name Reservation:** BHD 25–50
- **Municipality Fees:** BHD 100–200 (depends on office size/location)
- **Commercial Address (Virtual/Physical):**  *Virtual office options from BHD 350/year (Seef District); physical office spaces from BHD 1,200–5,000/year (high spec towers in Bahrain Bay)*
- **Professional Service Fees:** Starting from BHD 800–1,500 (for end-to-end setup via reputable agents)

A common entrepreneur mistake: under-budgeting for *municipality approval* delays or missing the extra stamps needed for regulated activities. *Avoid this by pre-checking all document requirements and using a trusted local agent.*

## Compliance & Post-Formation Essentials

![Feature Image: Legal compliance and documentation](https://images.pexels.com/photos/4427614/pexels-photo-4427614.jpeg,)
*Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation.*
- **Corporate Tax Returns/NIL Declarations** – Bahrain remains largely tax-free, but certain sectors must file VAT
- **Accounting & Bookkeeping:** Required by law, even for 100% foreign-owned startups
- **LMRA Reporting:** Mandatory for all companies with employees
- **Audit (if turnover > BHD 250k):** Hire a local, approved auditor

*Local tip: Ramadan business hours are shorter; plan all compliance filings outside holy month for smoother approvals.*

## Bahrain Free Zones: Special Perks for Foreign Entrepreneurs

![Feature Image: Business environment in Bahrain Free Zone](https://images.pexels.com/photos/325185/pexahrain’s)
*Alt text: Business environment in Bahrain Free Zone.* offer:

- 100% foreign ownership
- 0% corporate tax for up to 10 years
- Streamlined customs and import/export support
- No restrictions on capital repatriation or hiring

I set up a free zone trading company in 2023—my biggest challenge was the limited number of virtual office licenses available. *Best tip: Apply early in the year as free zone quotas fill up fast!*

## Insider’s Guide: Saving Time & Avoiding Mistakes

![Feature Image: Professional business support](https://images.pexels.com/photos/3184339/pexels-photo-3184339.jpeg)
*Alt text: Professional business support.* save days, if not weeks.

**Top Insider Tips:**

- **Best Application Times:** 8:00–10:00 AM, Sunday to Wednesday
- **Faster Municipality Approvals:** Choose offices in Seef or Bahrain Bay (newer buildings with digital submission)

## Tangent: Ramadan Timing, Coffee Rituals, and Why They Matter

Bahrain’s business pace shifts during Ramadan: office hours are shorter, but after-Iftar meetings blossom. I once sealed a multinational partnership at a majlis in Juffair, after the 10th cup of gahwa. These traditions may seem off-topic, but understanding them builds the rapport that can speed up everything from approvals to office searches.

## FAQ: Bahrain Company Formation & 100% Foreign Ownership

### Can I really own 100% of my business in Bahrain as a foreigner?

> Yes—if your business activity is on the MOICT’s expanded eligibility list (now more than 400 approved in 2025), you can own your company outright. [Check eligible activities here.](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/)

### Are there sectors where 100% ownership isn’t allowed?

> A few restricted sectors (defense, oil, specific telecoms) require Bahraini majority partners or special licensing. When in doubt, consult Sijilat or your corporate service provider.

### How much do I need to budget for company formation?

> Minimum all-in formation costs start from **BHD 1,000–2,500** for a basic SPC or WLL, exclusive of office rent and additional licenses. [Full cost details](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-cost/).

### Is a local sponsor or partner required?

> For most activities—no. But for restricted sectors, yes. [Understand local sponsorship here](https://keylinkbh.com/local-sponsorship-in-bahrain/).

### What are ongoing compliance requirements?

> Annual CR renewals, basic bookkeeping, VAT returns (if applicable), and labor reporting. [See Bahrain compliance services](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/).

---

> **Bahrain in 2025 is the GCC’s best-kept secret for foreign entrepreneurs.** With a little local insight and smart planning, full foreign ownership is not only possible but practical—opening doors to the Gulf and beyond.

My maintenance is about 1700 cal apparently and it feels very spartan - protein focused breakfast (400) protein focused small lunch (400), basic dinner at home - a protein, veg, serving of carbs (900). That does not leave any room for coffee shop, dining out or takeaway, ice cream/dessert/sweets of any type, or adult beverages.

I’m two months into my weight loss goals and have quite a ways to go. I think often about maintenance in the future because that will be the difference between gaining it all back again like I have so many times before.  It had been encouraging to think I might be able to be less restrictive on maintenance, but I really don’t think that’s true. 

This realization is frustrating and scary for me. I really enjoy dining out sometimes, I enjoy having adult beverages, and I enjoy baking and other things that it feels like the whole world is enjoying all the time all around me but how in the world are they doing that and not gaining? 

It feels like maintenance will not be worry free - it will be spartan 6 days a week, enjoy dining out or having drinks or baking something one day and spend the next 6 days getting back down to where you were

I can get them around 100€ price difference (950-1050€)

I did look into Gaggia Classic Pro but didnt want to tinker with the machine itself, when i am also learning how to make good espresso. So i settled for a machine a little pricier like the 3 mentioned.

Me and my girlfriend (who is willing to tolerate my espresso hobby) are drinking mostly cappuccino/lattes. When we have family over, they mostly drink normal coffee (so americano with an espresso machine?).

So normal usage will be 2 coffees after each other for me and my girlfriend, when family is over it could be 4-6 americanos/cappuccino/lattes.

So Dual Boiler/HX is the way to go, as far as i have researched.

I fear the Mara X is a little too manual for my gf, how is your experience?

  
I am planning to get a DF64 grinder to go with any of the machines.

1lumlwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/atlanticdiscussions/comments/1lumlwj/a_day_in_the_life_of_the_gen_z_worker/,A Day in the Life of the Gen Z Worker,"""That’s it! I loud quit! I have had it with these so-called workplace trends. First there was “quiet quitting,” when an employee … works only during work hours and puts in only the precise amount of work required to keep their job. And now there’s “micro-retirement,” a new trend of not working for a week or two weeks every 18 months, sometimes while employed, sometimes between jobs. Are you sure these are new workplace trends? Are you sure you aren’t just describing a routine phenomenon in an alarmed way? I took the liberty of recounting a typical workday in the language of workplace-trend pieces..........
The Gen Z worker awakes in the morning from her Microdeath (a new workforce trend where workers deliberately close their screens, repose horizontally, and are unavailable to respond to emails for up to eight hours) and dons her Whimsical Cloth Sheath (a new Gen Z trend where workers cover their body in colorful fabrics rather than sensible gray flannel).

Before arriving at her shared work location, the worker enters a crowded underground car to engage in a Tiny Detox, a new workforce trend where the worker’s phone or laptop fails to stay connected to the internet for the entire ride, giving the worker a refreshing break for sometimes the whole length of a tunnel! Many bosses frown on this trend, suggesting that it doesn’t really offer any mental-health benefits and the loss of productivity can be costly—as can its companion trend, the Mile High Detox (no internet on a plane). For the course of her Tiny Detox, the worker stares out the window.

After another Tiny Detox on the elevator up to her office, the Gen Z worker gets right to work until it’s time for her Microspa, a new workplace trend where workers visit a purpose-built room to excrete liquid and, in some cases, solid waste. Some employers advise against this! She flushes, emerging to a small area equipped with sinks and mirrors.
Her colleague Carla is giving herself a Hyper-Targeted Cleanse, a new Gen Z trend of using a special implement with stiff bristles to polish her teeth. “Hey, Carla,” the worker says.

Carla nods in greeting. “How was your weekend?”
“Great!” the worker says. “We had a barbecue. Yours?” (This is Voice Quitting, a new Gen Z workplace trend where colleagues use their voices during work hours to discuss nonwork topics instead of placing their voices into a seashell for the exclusive use of their employers. Some employers consider it a useful form of bonding, but many frown on it.)

She returns to her desk and types for three solid hours, occasionally stopping to Time Manage (a new trend where Gen Z workers glance at a personal timepiece rather than relying on their employer-supplied clocks) before getting back to work. Many Gen Z workers choose to Lung Bathe while in the workplace, and this worker is no exception, inflating not just one lung but both lungs. Decadent! This worker is also engaged in the new trend of Organmaxxing, where workers hoard both kidneys selfishly for themselves instead of offering one to their employers.
Finally, it is 1:50 p.m. Just 10 more minutes until her Microvacation! To participate in this new trend, she gets up from her desk to travel briefly to a second, more fun location—in this case, a coffee shop—for fewer than 30 minutes. Some workers take multiple Microvacations per week, and employers warn it can be addictive.

She returns to her desk and gets back to work. Fortunately, she did not engage in any Medical Malingering (a new workforce trend where doctor appointments are scheduled during the workweek rather than at night or on weekends), so she has the whole afternoon to produce value for her employer with her labor before she Silent Retreats (a new trend where workers, instead of opting to spend the night in the office, leave work to engage in Microdeath in another location, sometimes with roommates or cats).

1lumjxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheImprovementClub/comments/1lumjxo/how_i_stopped_being_a_complete_loser_and_actually/,How I Stopped Being a Complete Loser and Actually Started Winning at Life (After 3 Years of Being a Disappointment),"I was 23, living in my mom's basement, and hadn't left the house in 4 days straight. My friends were getting promotions, relationships, and respect while I was refreshing the same 3 websites for 8 hours daily.

I was the guy everyone felt sorry for. The one people stopped inviting to things because they knew I'd make excuses anyway.

Then I had a moment that changed everything. A moment so brutal it forced me to either change or accept being a failure forever.

My younger brother brought his girlfriend over for dinner. As we sat around the table, she asked what I did for work. The silence was deafening. My mom jumped in with some bullsh\*t excuse about me ""figuring things out.""

Later that night, I heard them talking in his room. She said, ""I feel bad for your brother. He seems so... lost.""

That word hit me like a truck. Lost.

I wasn't just lazy. I wasn't just going through a rough patch. I was lost, and everyone could see it except me.

Instead of wallowing (my usual move), I asked myself something different:

**""What kind of man do I want to be when I'm 30?""**

Not what I wanted to achieve. Not what goals I had. What kind of **person** I wanted to be.

The answer came immediately: Someone people respect. Someone who keeps his word. Someone who doesn't make excuses.

Then I asked the follow-up question:

**""What kind of man will I be at 30 if I keep living like this?""**

The answer made my stomach drop. I'd be the same loser, just older. Still making excuses. Still disappointing everyone, including myself.

Here's what I did (and why it works when everything else fails):

1. I picked ONE thing. Not a morning routine. Not 5 habits. ONE thing: Make my bed every morning. Why this works: Your brain can't argue with something so stupidly simple.
2. I made it non-negotiable. Bad day? Make the bed. Sick? Make the bed. Hungover? Make the bed. Why this works: Consistency builds identity. ""I'm someone who always makes his bed"" becomes part of who you are.
3. I celebrated small wins. Day 7 of making my bed? I bought myself a coffee. Day 30? New sheets. Just made me happy over all.
4. Added habits after a month 2: Bed + 10 pushups. Month 3: Bed + pushups + read 5 pages. Why this works: You build on success, not failure. Each habit makes the next one easier.
5. I wrote my ""anti-vision"". I wrote a detailed description of my life at 30 if I changed nothing. Reading it every morning. It was painful but sure did give me the drive to do hard things.

After 90 days of this system:

* People started treating me differently (with actual respect)
* I got offered a job through a connection who noticed my ""new energy""
* My family stopped making excuses for me (really happy about this one)
* I felt like a man instead of a boy for the first time in years

If I can do it so you too.

Ah, rugby!

Owen Doyle, ever the drama queen, is still salty about the Waratahs game’s refereeing. John O’Sullivan, meanwhile, is traipsing through Lisbon like a lost tourist, whispering, “Where’s my luggage?

All about speed and “running power”—because nothing says “premiership” like a bunch of sprinters with a caffeine addiction.  

**Brisbane Lions: Aging Star or Myth?**  
Coach Chris Fagan has officially shut down Joe Daniher’s comeback. “He’s on holiday in Europe, enjoying life,” Fagan says, as if Daniher’s idea of fun is sipping wine and avoiding 180kg forwards.

What are our options? I’ve thought of laying flooring over, trying to remove the paint, and various cleaning solutions/tools.

So I’ve been making creative classroom resources for a while—mostly things like paper crafts, themed templates, simple hands-on stuff that a lot of teachers seem to use, especially around the holidays or for fun lesson add-ons.

Lately, I’ve been toying with the idea of putting together a monthly bundle of these resources—just something small, useful, and easy to grab when you need it. The kind of thing I wish existed when I was digging through Pinterest at 10pm.

But before I do anything, I wanted to ask:  
Would this actually be helpful to you?  
What sort of resources do you often need but can't find?  
How often do you think you'd want new ones?

And if it were a paid thing, what would feel fair to you? Something like the cost of one or two coffees a month? Or honestly, would you rather not pay for something like this at all? Totally fine either way—I’d just really like to hear the honest version.

Thanks for even reading this far. Just trying to make sure I build something that’s actually worth it for teachers.",1,1751974915.0,ArtEd,2,1.0,False
1lumcrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lumcrc/did_i_36m_handle_secure/,Did I (36M) handle secure?,"Hi all,

Just had a situation with a girl I was dating. Know I can be quite direct and harsh, but for my future dates I wanna know whether I handled secure in this situation.

I (36M) matched with a girl (27F) on a dating app. First we had a great connection, talked really nice for 2 days and then suddenly she said the conversation is more friendly and that's not the idea. I only reacted with thumbs up and unmatched directly.

A couple of days later I saw she did like me again. I encountered her profile again a couple of days later and I liked her back. We re-started the conversation and it was flowing again. I also asked about her last message and she said she was new in the app, got overwhelmed, got panicked and wanted to go off the app. But she said it was not appropiate the way she reacted and said sorry. We talked further and got also into deep conversations, about our preferences, expectations, future, everything basically. And agreed on a coffee date.

Just before the date she sent she would be a bit later. I saw it, but could not respond given I was busy, wanted to respond in the car. Not even 15 mins passed and I wanted to react and saw she sent another message stating it was rude to left her on read on date day and if I wanted to blow off the date I could just say it and she would tgo into that direction anyway and it wouldn't matter. I reacted calm and said I was just busy and would see her there. She was more than 20 mins to late (but updated me) and I explained her when she texted I was busy and she should be more calm. The date was fine, after the date I told her I enjoyed and wanted to see her in a different setting. She gave me her number by herself. The message before the date was the first red flag I kinda ignored.

Then we continued on whatsapp. It was all fine, I set up a day for a dinner and told her I would like it if I could pick her up and drop her off (she is traditional and lives at home so she didn't want her parents to know but picking up around was fine). Then the second issue arised. We agreed on Monday but she said she hopes she can make it given she will go on a trip for work on Thursday and will miss 2 working days and overtime may be necessary. She communicated she will probably not make it, so I shifted my agenda given I was busy throughout the week and also mentioned another date on Friday and we agreed up on Sunday. She only told me that she would have a daily trip on Saturday, but will not sleep overnight and could be too tired on Sunday to dress up for dinner. I said I appreciate she lets me know and that we can see how she feels and can go for just a coffee or walk. She also asked me to let her know if the other date on Friday would go well and if I don't want to meet her. I said it's just a first date and I would never skip other dates due to another date but still I would net her know if it goes really well. On Saturday I did not app her given I was busy, she was on a trip and the date was set. I messaged her on Sunday first thing morning asking how she feels and what she would prefer. She said she did not arrange it at home given it was radio silence since my date on Friday and I did not app her on Saturday. I was surprised given the date was set (just not what and what time) and she especially said she would wanna see how she feels. And I explained her I did not contact on Saturday given she was on a trip, I was busy and the date was set. And it would be more logical on Sunday given she knows better how she feels. She said it was an ""international dating rule"" which I didn't understand. Normally yes I would arrange what to do and let her know before, but given the circumstances it was set. Eventually she backed off and she said she could still arrange it. Eventually she was again too late, in total around 20-30 minutes but still updated me. The date itself was fine, I picked her up, dropped her off and it was all good. She was very nervous given it was her third date ever (she never been in a relationship) and it was also the first time she was in the car with someone else than family) I told her after the date I enjoyed it, she looked beautifull and looking forward to more dates. She responded the feeling was mutual, she enjoyed it even more than the first date and she even has physical activities to do for the next dates. Given she has holidays soon I told her we should check soon what is possible and how to process. I also mentioned the issue we had, explained my view and why I didn't contact her on Saturday. Afterwards she said she was happy I brought it up given she found it difficult to discuss it but was happy we concluded. I also liked even though there was a misunderstand we could just discuss and go on a date without harsh feelings (healthy conflict resolution is really important for me).

Then some days passed. What bothered was that I was everyday the person checking in. After work I send her some apps and check in. She responds allways fast, enthousiastic and extensive but it all comes from me everyday. Then I decided to leave it one day, got no response from her then and I messaged her the day after. I tried to be as open and keen as possible. I told her I am very happy and feel a connection growing and also feeling the mutual interest from her side. However the fact that I have been checking in for 8-9 days in a row and not getting one conversation starter from her side bothered me a little bit and whether she could be attentive in the future. Totally not looking for an excuse, explanation, just an 'I feel you and it wasn't intentional, will account for' would be more than enough for me. Instead I got excuse after excuse and imo they were not right. First she said she was sad about a comment I made 2 days ago and she was busy the day she did not text. Then I asked her about the other 7-8 days. She first said I was just before her each day. And then she said she did not want to text double and it is not necessary for her to text everyday. When a conversation has ended she apparently checks who has sent the last message and if that's her she will not start a conversation according to her 'dating rules'. And she told me she did message first when we were chatting on the dating app (which is true), but I was talking about whatsapp since I got her number. And I checked and she still had 2 days I had the last 'message' and she said it is only 2 out of 5 days and I shouldn't make a point about it.

And relating to the comment. After the date I checked in and she said she was doing skincare. Her skin wasn't looking good the last days and she said 'you also should have seen that during the date'. I told jokingly even if I would I would not given I am a taurus and a real gentlemen. Her response was did you really say that? I said yes and the conversation ended there. She told me she found my comment insulting and offensive and I shouldn't react. I did let it there but she did not text me that day because she was not happy about my comment. She said I had not to react at all. Actually I told her she wanted a reaction given she said 'you should have seen that during the date' and that she should boost her self-confidence. She then said she maybe wanted some reassurance and some later she said she definitely wanted re-assurance given ""she's just a girl"". I told her that I want to give compliments when I'm in a relationship and I am convenient with it and I do not see it was my task as just dating guy to boost her self-confidence. Harsh, but I was triggered at this point. We eventually ended the conversation there.

In the morning I had a more calm mind and didn't want to give up due to a miscommunication. Especially because after the first two red flags she showed maturity. So I wrote her a message stating I don't want to leave things in the middle, I was not looking for an excuse (which I truly wasn't) and the past did not matter for me. I just wanted re-assurance for the future and if she agrees upon that that's good enough for me. And I ger her point not to text everyday which is fine for me. And that regarding the comment I was sarcastic but if she doesn't appreciate sarcasm in this stage because she doesn't know me very well I understand that and I can account for that in the future. But I still want to give compliments on my own idea and pace and I'm not keen on just giving compliments because she needs validation. And that if that is fine we can keep on going. She eventually directly starting arguing again and that was the moment I was done, wished her luck and she wished it back and we were done. My question is: did I act secure enough in these situations and did I dodge a bullet or was I too rational/direct/harsh/insecure and did I had to act differently?

Summary:  gone to 2 dates with a girl, had 2 red flags-ish situations imo which I ignored given we handled it maturely. Then I let her know I would appreciate if she would text first, it turned out to be a huge argument and I folded. Did I act secure or not given the circumstances?",1,1751974908.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

After hearing that, I excited ran to the door. Apparently the Cafe of the End has a delivery service, and after trying their coffee, I think I am addicted to coffee, so I ordered a while ago, and now it should be finally here. YAY!

However, when I opened the door, instead of coffee, it was a couple holding 2 toddlers. 

""Divination told us this would be a good place to bring our children. Could you help us, the compensation would be a sequence 6 characteristic. Please allow us a last chance to talk as humans."", the wife pleaded.

And apparently I am very easy to guilt trip, because I immediately agreed.

According to the parents, both toddlers are 3, saints of the mystic pryer and savant pathway, and are called paimon and cyrene respectively. I'm not exactly sure what is happening, but I am too scared to ask, so I invited paimon and cyrene into my house.

Cyrene waddled over to my work bench slowly, and every step she took gave me a minor heart attack. I would have loved to stop her from touching my thing, but unfortunately, my leg was being held be Paimon with enough force to crush a normal person's leg. 

As I pried Paimon off with one hand, my other was desperately waving at Cyrene to come back. Unfortunately for me, I watched as Cyrene forced her cute little ass (DONT TAKE IT WRONGLY) onto my bench, and started fiddling with a new weapon mechanism that I was trying to figure out.

And it turns out the most painful thing to hear is not, ""We are breaking up"" or ""XXX died"", it is when a literal 3 year old stares at you dead in the eye while pointing at your lives' work and says ""Human, stupid. I will fix"", and actually starts dismantling it correctly.

With my new found emotional distress, I decided to leave Cyrene alone and deal with Paimon, who looked like she was about to cry. 

""Human, I want food, give me food.... wuwuwuwuwu"", Paimon grabbed on my leg tearfully. *At least this is a normal child response, I can do that,* I thought to myself. I grabbed some bread, peanut butter, and jam, to make a pb and j sandwich, which should be universally accepted as food.

Luckily, Paimon did, and gobbled up the sandwich in 4 bites. As I watched her munch on it enthusiastically, i thought, *arent these children adorable.*

But after cleaning off the entire plate, Paimon looked at me in the eyes (they need to stop doing that its creepy), and said one singular word, 

# ""MORE""

*She must be quite hungry,* I think to myself, not knowing the fate that would soon befall upon me.

For the next 2 hours, I was stuck in a perpetual loop of making sandwiches, giving it to Paimon, praying that she would be satisfied, only for her to ask for more again. Every time I placed a new sandwich on her plate, I turned back, continuing to make more, and more, and more, and more......

How long has it been.

I don't know anymore.....

Perhaps I would be stuck in this perpetual cycle, forced to feed this child forever

I....

I don't even have anymore bread.... (blasphemous I know)

I used it all.....

All the 17 bags of bread i bought were gone....

Just like that........

WHEN WILL THIS END

""I guess I have to pull out my emergency food"", I mutter under my breath as I finished to last piece of bread.

As I turned to give the bread to Paimon, I saw her shriveled up in a corner, tears once again in her eyes, as she cried, ""Paimon is sorryy!!! Paimon won't eat anymore, please don't eat Paimon!!!"" 

I nearly lampooned, before i knelt down next to her, and comforted her (i cant really do this irl so im just not gonna write it). Somehow that worked, and Paimon jumped up and ran over to my book shelf, picked up a random book, and started reading.

Meanwhile, Cyrene looked at me, stumbled her way over, and gently dragged me to my work bench. She then showed me with more dexterity than any child should have, how to modify a machine gun round into a standard hand gun, increase the firepower, and reduce backlash from the gun (i forgot what its called lol). A child should not be this smart.

Luckily for me, they seems more than content to entertain themselves with my stuff, so at least I should get some peace. 

Approximately 2.4 seconds after that thought was formed, Paimon shit herself, and i spent 2 hours cleaning up her giant dook dook on the floor

PAIN

Somehow, that was the only main problem i faced. 

As night fell, both toddlers disappeared, smiling happily at me. For a second, I felt satisfied, happy, grateful for this chance, then I looked at my house. They might have left, but not the giant mess they made.

Looking at my house, I turned around, walked out, and headed straight to Cafe of the End.

""17 expresso shots please, and a latte"" I told the cashier, offering 10 more days of dishwashing.

But many of us walk in unsure of what to say or how to stand out — without sounding like we’re selling.

Here are 3 underrated strategies that work surprisingly well:

**1. Lead with curiosity, not a pitch**  
Don’t talk about yourself first. Ask questions. Be genuinely interested. That’s what builds trust.

**2. Follow up quickly (not a week later)**  
A quick LinkedIn message, coffee invite or even a voice note the next day can turn a casual chat into something real.

**3. Focus on quality over quantity**  
It’s not about collecting 15 contacts. One deep conversation can lead to long-term business, or even a partnership.

**How do you handle 5@7s?**  
Do you plan ahead or improvise? What’s worked for you?

Hey, fellow creators! Let’s get real for a second. How many times have you shelled out cash for tools, subscriptions, or courses, only to feel like you’re stuck in a never-ending loop of mediocre content creation? 🙈 Yeah, me too. 

The AI bubble might be on its way to bursting, and we don’t want to be the ones left holding the *""I just spent too much money on this tool that I barely use""* bag, right? Let’s chat about three beginner-friendly creator tools that are total game-changers. These will not only save you bucks but also unleash your creativity like a kid in a candy store. 🍭 

### 1. **Canva** 🎨
Seriously, if you're not using Canva, WHAT are you doing?! It’s like the Swiss army knife of design tools. 

- **User-Friendly**: No PhD in graphic design needed here. Just drag-and-drop! 
- **Templates Galore**: From social media posts to presentations, you get endless templates that look like a million bucks.
- **Pricing**: The free version is 🔥, but if you want more features, the Pro version is totally worth it for the price!

Imagine creating stunning visuals as you sip coffee, and not feeling like you need to sell a kidney to afford it. Ah, the dream!

### 2. **Descript** 📹 
Okay, confession time: I used to hate editing videos. I would spend ages trying to chop out awkward pauses or mistakes. 🙃 Enter Descript.

- **Transcription Magic**: Get your audio and video transcribed for free! Yup, no more painstakingly typing out what you said. 
- **Edit by Text**: Just highlight text and cut it like Word docs. No more scary timelines!
- **AI Voices**: Need to add or replace audio? Just type it out, and Descript will read it back to you. 

It’s like having a personal editing assistant who works 24/7 without complaining! 🙌

### 3. **Loom** 📽️ 
If you’re doing anything remotely requiring explanations, Loom is your best friend. 

- **Quick Screenshots & Recordings**: Share your screen and your charming personality all in one go. Capture your thoughts in seconds.
- **Easy Sharing**: Once you record, it’s just a click away from sharing. No more lengthy emails!

So, yeah, these tools are just **a fraction** of what’s out there, but they’re solid picks to get you rolling without throwing cash down the drain! 💪 And who doesn’t love feeling empowered and creative without needing a lottery win to fund our dreams?

When I entered, my boyfriend was already there with his friend or something sitting down on my couch. He has a key to my place, so I didn’t think much of it as he sometimes passes by even when I’m not there. Although I didn’t know that girl I still said “hi.” It’s a habit that I have, always being polite and what. I sat down and we chatted for a bit, basic conversation, which actually was just “yes” and “no’s” and nods from my side. She introduced herself, said she was his coworker and all. Tbh, I already didn’t like her just by looking at her face but I stayed pretty quiet the whole time cuz I was too tired to entertain anyone’s bullshit. She stayed for coffee then left, after that I just headed to the shower. 

When I came out of the bathroom, my boyfriend sat me down and told me he wanted an open relationship with that wicked bitch with a clearly messed up blonde coloration. I obv said no and kicked him out after some sort of argument, which really was just me sighing and yawning while he was trying to convince me. 

Today I received a text from him asking if we were good. I left him on read but idk. I obviously still like him, but I don’t want to share and felt pretty disrespected. I mean, am I too possessive or something? Should I let him open our relationship?

1lum7sz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1lum7sz/host_is_wanting_to_charge_additional_away_from/,Host is wanting to charge additional away from the platform [England],"Hi, apologies for format, I'm on my phone so will try be clear. 

Stayed in a large Airbnb property this weekend and had a very aggressive call from the host. 

- Apparently the house wasn't cleaned, we cleaned as much as we could with a 10am check out. All 20 beds stripped and towels in the bathrooms, rubbish cleared away. No room left in outside bins so left in bin bags inside as not to attract wildlife.

-Host has called me being very aggressive, threatening to charge my card £180 for further cleaning.

- We hoovered and mopped twice throughout our stay. We did leave 8, unopened beers in the kitchen and 1 coffee cup/teaspoon washed up.

-The host requested an additional £680 outside of Airbnb for additional 4 guests (Airbnb only allowed 16 when booking) this included £20 for private parking. 

-Private parking was at another one of their properties, on arrival to pick the car up at 9am, it was blocked in. Called the host 8 times in the space of half an hour to no response. Ended up having to knock on the door of this property to solve the issue. 

-Messaged host about showers not working, no response and no response to phone calls. 

-Host was pretty crap with responding throughout whole process, took over a week to reply sometimes. Also was late to our check in when confirmed multiple times. 

-Aggressive on phone call 2 days post check out. Swearing and threatening to charge my card. Asking me to transfer her money now. I said I was putting the phone down and she can take it through Airbnb. 

-Wants to charge for moving a chair down one floor. 

We stupidly didn't take pictures but we were wanting to be out by the stated check out time of 10am. Private carpark was half hour walk away and by 9am saw it was blocked in, spent 45 minutes trying to resolve so forgot to take pictures. No contact after check out to ask if we managed to get the car out.

Can she charge my card or is there a process through Airbnb? 

She is acting like we should have left it as spotless as we found it with not a trace of anyone staying (with the exception of stripped beds). It wasn't spotless but it was left in a much better state than when I used to clean large properties years ago.",2,1751974450.0,AirBnB,6,1.0,False

I've a complex situation and want to know how  to make the most of it. I don't necessarily want to be sold any financial products.

I've seen 3 highly recommended advisers and thry all go through a spreadsheet with my weekly expenses.. I can do this myself. 
Any interesting things I've ever heard were from people who were not financial advisors, just business owners or farmers ( I know, I know, I should have asked them who their financial advisor was) .

I'm not loaded , so I may not be of interest to the best advisors out there. 

Also wondering if there is a one stop shop for financial and tax advice together.. I was going over and back last year with each of them giving polar opposite advice.

Many thanks in advance

1lum0dh,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1lum0dh/i_dropped_everything_to_build_an_ainative_erp_and/,I Dropped Everything to Build an AI-Native ERP… and I Think i might drop out from uni,"A few months ago, I sat across from my co-founder in a tiny Dubai coffee shop, both of us surviving on 3 hours of sleep and a mountain of self-belief.

We are broke. We were exhausted.
And we had just committed to building something insane:
An AI-native ERP that could automate 60% of business operations.

Not “AI features” slapped onto an old system.
Not a prettier spreadsheet.
A full-stack ERP, built from the ground up to think, decide, and operate like a real assistant not just record-keeping software.


My Breaking Point

This started from pain.

I had run multiple small businesses before: dropshipping, marketing agencies, flipping cars you name it.

Every single one of them ran into the same wall:
Too many tools. Too much manual admin. Too little time to actually grow.

Inventory in one tab. CRM in another. Accounting software that I couldn’t understand .
And AI? Only good for generating blog posts or helping with copy. Nowhere near the backend of operations.

So i asked ourselves:

“What if AI could run the business not just help us write about it?”

That question turned into a rabbit hole that created doryo.ai


Building Doryo

I incorporated in Delaware handled all business aspects .
My co founder coded. And coded. And coded.

170,000+ lines of Django later, we had our first working prototype.

It could:

Connect to your sales, inventory, HR, and accounting systems

Read your entire business health in real time

Detect bottlenecks

And (this is the magic) start recommending and automating actions like reordering low stock or predicting payroll risks or literally anything about ur business while comparing it to real time market 

We named it Doryo.
Means “coworker” in Japanese. Felt right.

The Crazy Part?

We’re not some huge team.
It’s me (a CS student turned relentless operator) and my co-founder (a one-man tech army who wrote the entire codebase from scratch).

No funding. No rich uncle. No YC. Just a burning obsession and way too much caffeine.


Why I Think This Will Be Massive

Because AI shouldn’t just be a gimmick.
It should make small businesses operate like big ones.

Think:

A 3-person eCom brand running like it has a 15-person ops team

A local service business predicting and optimizing schedules without hiring more staff

A solo founder scaling without drowning in admin hell

We’re not here to build a tool.
We’re building a business brain one that understands, thinks, and acts.


What I’ve Learned (So Far)

Most people overestimate how hard it is to start and underestimate how hard it is to keep going

Launching a SaaS without capital is pure chaos but chaos builds clarity

The best products don’t start with market research, they start with personal pain

If you’re not embarrassed by your first version, you waited too long


We’re still early.
We have users testing.
We break stuff. A lot.
But I’ve never been more convinced we’re building something important.

If you’ve ever run a small business and wished there was a real assistant to run the backend, I think you’ll get why we’re obsessed.

Happy to answer any questions on building in this space, AI for operations, or just surviving as a SaaS founder without losing your mind.

1lulzpx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/1lulzpx/why_doesnt_india_produce_its_own_matcha/,Why Doesn't India Produce Its Own Matcha?,"India is one of the largest tea producers in the world, with regions like Assam, Darjeeling, and Nilgiri producing high-quality tea. We already have the suitable environmental conditions for growing the raw materials and the infrastructure for high-volume processing.

The method of processing of the tea leaves makes matcha distinct from ordinary black tea. Process of matcha making [here](https://youtu.be/sz2a7dtUEFs?si=h6WdnT573-wrUqeH).

Recently, I wanted to explore Indian Matcha brands after having tasted many overseas matcha brands. Overseas matcha brands are expensive in India due to import tax. I was surprised to find that there is no such option of a homegrown brand! 

Even [Mittal Teas](https://mittalteas.com/products/japanese-matcha?srsltid=AfmBOorZD-acyZDpYj5fOci3mJztkj6-wbjTaPUdXYPtSZuQGnpssAxn) that focuses on branding its tea as Indian Tea imports its matcha from Japan. For context, Mittal teas is a supplier for the Taj Group.

Granted, the tea and coffee sector in India is disorganised and matcha manufacturing requires expertise that Japanese and Chinese manufacturers have had from centuries as they traditionally drink matcha. 

But apart from R&D, is there a technological or equipment-related reason why matcha manufacturing might not be possible in India? For e.g, the matcha manufacturing machines and equipment from abroad is not sold in India?",1,1751973697.0,AskIndia,7,0.67,False

There are 6 of us total and we've been going since we turned 18. Last year we had to skip it because one of us got c*vid and we always stick together. My best friend has a 14 month old son. Since her son was born, we haven't had a day alone with her. I guess it's understandable because she is a new mum. We tried to include her in all the plans we had since she had her child, but noticed she would ask what the plan was to accommodate her baby coming too. This meant the plan was always a coffee shop. I genuinely didn't mind changing all of the plans to be more child-friendly. Just assumed that she couldn't get her man or parents to watch her baby for a while. I called her a few weeks ago and asked if she wanted to come to a club with us, and she asked if we can go to a coffee shop instead so she could bring her baby. I asked if there was no one who could watch her baby (she lives with her husband who works from home and her in laws) to which she replied that she'll feel insane mum guilt if she goes to a club and leaves her baby home. I said I understood but that I really need a night out, and we could do coffee day. She seemed disappointed but agreed. I went to bed that night feeling slightly guilty but mostly relieved. Despite my constant efforts to adapt our plans around her son she seemed unable to grasp my desire to just one adult evening. Her irritation was palpable, though she eventually dropped the subject. When our long awaited getaway approached, I deliberately avoided mentioning it, knowing her situation. Unfortunately, another friend let it slip. Her light-hearted inquiry about the missing invitation left me fumbling awkwardly before extending the customary welcome, hoping she understood the adults only nature. My optimism proved misplaced when she phoned about child-friendly amenities at our chosen resort. After explaining our preference for her nightlight venues, she declared the trip impossible without proper accommodations for her son. Her sister's furious call that evening, hurling accusations about my supposed childishness, left me reeling. Years had passed since we enjoyed uninhibited time together. either tending to her baby or dealing with pandemic separations. This reunion marked out first gathering since completing undergraduate studies and beginning graduate programs. After such demanding years, we craved one weekend of freedom. Previous attempts at adults-only celebrations had failed; my birthday requests much earlier met dismissal through jokes about their inseparable bond, followed by requests to limit alcohol consumption for her son's sake. These incidents extended beyond isolated occurrences. Shes grown resentful whenever we ventured out without her. She consistently proposing daytime coffee alternatives to evening plans. A simple Instagram post from a pub date prompted her bizarre message questioning my drinking habits. Discussions with our friend group revealed deeper patterns. She's been pressuring our coupled friends about marriage and children despite that their young age, while scrutinising my dating life. Her inability to accept different life choices became increasingly annoying. Following our incredible week away-our best since prependamic times-we postponed addressing  the situation until returning. My message offering to visit with gifts went unread for days. Her husband confirmed that she was struggling
but couldn't explain her silence. Her eventual response accused us of expecting her to abandon motherhood, revealing her true opinion of our lifestyle. She announced their plans another child, before cutting all contact through every platform. Our friendship since middle school ended abruptly, leaving confusion but maybe necessary closure. Her husband, whom we befriended separately, has repeatedly attempted arranging solo outings, offering payment for spa treatments, only to face arguments about leaving their child. Despite being financially supported as a housewife she'll be in constant physical presence as motherhood's only valid expression. She openly criticized any parent seeking childcare, planning to delay schooling indefinitely. Family offered babysitting that faced rejection. Even her mum had never watched her grandchild alone. Her rigid interpretation of parenting seemed unshakeable, regardless of support available. The months that followed brought unexpected clarity to their fractured dynamic.

But Maybe You’ll Make Me Inhale Sharply,"Look, I’ll be honest: this is basically my *Hail Mary pass* into the void. I’m 37, somewhere cold and suspiciously polite in Europe (yes, we have more than one IKEA), working in game dev — meaning I spend my days telling imaginary creatures exactly how to move, which is wildly more successful than trying to figure out real people.

I’ve pretty much accepted my destiny as a champion of solo coffee runs and late-night YouTube spirals. BUT — on the off chance there’s a woman out there who’s smart, a bit sarcastic, and thinks “getting to know someone properly” is more fun than doomscrolling… well, here I am, flailing enthusiastically.

Not looking for romance. Just someone who appreciates a solid back-and-forth of weird observations, deep dives into obscure topics, and memes that are too clever for the average group chat.

So if you’re also slightly weird, maybe a bit bored, timezone-aligned (Europe-ish), and willing to give my last-ditch post a chance, tell me:

They are dangerous because in a couple instances there are parts of large trees remaining that look like they could come down at any minute.   Also because the road is narrow the parts that are sticking out could damage a car if the car had to get over when passing another car.

**Yard waste collection**
Case 1354582
Still have large amounts of tree debris on my yard from the storm on June 26.  Last week the crews cut and removed branches back to about 3 feet from the road, but left the majority of the two trees that fell onto my property across Berea Road. 

Please send a crew to finish removing this material.  
My family spent Saturday cutting up the trees and consolidating and piling the brush to try to save as much of our grass as possible.   Broken down as it is, it should more easily fit in the truck. 

I have yard maintenance scheduled for Wednesday so I would really appreciate this material being removed by 5 PM Tuesday.

**This request involves maintenance needed to cut back invasive honeysuckle that is growing at the end of a street that is involving/affecting 1) storm drain, 2) street sign, and 3) park entrance.  On Becky Place there is residential access to Mount Tabor P**
ark. There are supposed to be 2 red diamond signs at the end of the street, indicating that the road ends. However, invasive honeysuckle that is overgrown from the park is coming onto the street. It is blocking and creating leaf and trash debris and buildup near the storm drains and is completely covering one of the road signs!! As one of the residents living at the end of the street, I have cut down a bunch an moved it into my yard (457 Becky Pl); however, it is exhausting work a bunch of overgrowth remains that continues to block the sign and cause issues for the drain. Despite having cut down a ton of this 2 years ago, it appears to have grown back with a vengeance! Can you please send people to come cut this overgrowth that is on public property and affecting public areas? The entrance to the park needs maintenance as well, and appears to have some rose/thorn bushes mixed in. This job will require a heavy duty mulcher, for certain.

When I finally got to the counter, I asked for my muffin, but somehow, it got lost in translation, and the barista handed me a bran muffin with a confused look. 😅

Cue my bewilderment: 'Wait, I ordered a chocolate one, right?' I asked, chuckling a bit. He smirked and said, 'Oh, so you're the one trying to be healthy with the bran surprise!' We both laughed, and I couldn't help but tease back, 'Healthy? With this coffee habit? Yeah, right!'

He winked and replied, 'Well, I'm saving you from too much chocolate...' handing me my rightful muffin at last. To my surprise, as I turned to leave, he called out, 'Next one's on me for the mix-up. Maybe next time, you can brave the bran!' 

Just a simple mistake turned into a fun little exchange...and a free coffee. I guess misunderstanding occasionally pays off, eh? 😂",1,1751973226.0,nicenewcontact,0,1.0,False

1lultog,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/1lultog/how_to_fix_messed_up_family_situation/,How to fix messed up family situation?,"Kia ora. Hope I don't get doxxed for this but I need serious help. Basically I live with my grandparents in a 3 bedroom house. I've been here all of my life so they're essentially parents to me. They're now pensioners in their mid 70s. 

One of my aunts was struggling over in aus as an nz citizen single mother. She has 5 kids (3 in school, 2 adults). We went over there in 2023 and they were in a pretty rough living situation. My family decided to help them move back to NZ at the end of 2023 where they could get more welfare support (in addition to the child support) and family help instead of being basically on their own. They were going to live with my grandparents and I for a couple of months until they got on their feet here.

The problem is that it's been a year and a half and they're still living with us. 

We don't always get on very well. I feel like my aunt gaslights us a lot and has traits of narcissism maybe? It feels like most of the time she has to be correct and everyone else in her life such as friends or other family who go against her (such as by telling her to move out) are ""two faced"" or wrong or whatever. 

For example: I paid her and her kids airfares here on the expectation they'd pay it back as soon as possible when they got here (such as with the funds from selling their car as they left aus). This didn't happen for like 3-4 months until one day my grandparents blew up at her for not paying me among other reasons (I have never seen my grandparents so angry before). She blew up at my grandparents in return and started saying stuff like her and the kids would go and live on the street if they had to. She & co then went and stayed at another family members place for a night... before coming back and not really saying much. Oh yeah and she returned the money to me by throwing it onto my bed during her outburst. I also paid for her boxes to be moved here free of charge (as in I didn't expect/want that money back).

Ever since then my grandparents have been like very placid and don't blow up anymore. I know my grandma doesn't like the living situation but grandpa is very withdrawn I guess? Often if I stand up to my aunt he will go off at me for ""starting shit"" and have an argument with my grandma. I'm fairly certain he is depressed or something. They both don't want their grandkids (who they love and get on well with most of the time) to live on the street so kicking them out isn't an option but I am done with dealing with this for over a year and a half. My grandma also admitted to me a few weeks ago that none of them pay rent/board. I'm on studylink and pay my grandparents.

Admittedly I'm not perfect either. I have gotten angry with them a few times but I feel like that's natural in a 3 bedroom 1 bath house with 9 people? One time I smelled my aunts coffee a bit close and she flipped out at me and tipped it in the sink. Probably was a bad idea on my part admittedly. I told her to fuck off once when we were building a shelf. I also pushed (not physically) in the shower before her one time because I got annoyed at struggling to get the bathroom.

When we ask when they're moving out it's always an excuse like ""oh we're waiting for kainga ora"" or ""we've been looking"" etc. Whenever she is upset she says she is moving out but she first said that over a year ago. She owns a $10,000+ car. I don't know what to do without upsetting my grandparents but at this point it feels like borderline elder abuse and something needs to change. I am desperate. There are so many other things going on in this house I could rant about. Am I irrational or is this fucked? Do I just weather the storm with my grandpa and start more shit so they leave? At this point I am happy to destroy my short term mental health with fights if it helps long term. My grandma made me promise not to move out because if they had 2 bedrooms it would be another excuse to stay.",4,1751973133.0,newzealand,7,1.0,False

# Not Just Design for Design’s Sake:

We don’t believe in applying the same template to every home. Noida is full of variety, compact studio flats, sprawling builder floors, rental homes, and everything in between. So we begin by listening. Really listening.

Maybe you need a study corner that doubles as a vanity because space is tight. Maybe you want a wardrobe that doesn't just look good but stores your chaos neatly. Maybe your kitchen needs to keep up with your cooking marathons. We don’t guess, we ask.

# Furniture That Doesn’t Waste Space (Or Time):

We take into account the fact that every home has different priorities. We'll figure out a way to fit a shoe rack with seating in your hallway. We'll find a solution if you detest overhead cabinets. We'll work with you to determine your style if you're not sure what it is.

We’re known for:

* Modular kitchens that make the morning rush bearable
* Wardrobes that store more without taking over the room
* TV units that aren’t bulky or boring
* Beds with storage that actually hold more than just winter blankets
* Custom pieces that don’t scream “modular” but quietly work  

You don’t have to know what “laminate finish” or “PU shutters” are, that’s our job. We’ll explain what matters and leave the rest out.

# What Makes Us the “Best”? 

# We don't claim to be the best because of ostentatious numbers or large honors. Getting it right for you is our main goal. This entails posing pertinent queries, being forthright about what will and won't work, and presenting solutions rather than merely mood boards. We don't care about making an impression. It all comes down to designing areas that are easy to love, easy to live in, and difficult to leave.

1lulrq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/1lulrq0/im_even_more_done/,I'm even more done,"Roughly 2 weeks ago, I complained about some of the creative ways RA has found to screw with me. I thought that would be it, but alas, I'm back with part 2. This is partly to vent and partly because some of this is actually funny and I know you all can relate and get a chuckle out of this. 

I was at the rheums last week for my regular recap and review of the blood tests I failed and got some good and bad news. The good news? While the numbers aren't ideal, my kidneys are mostly fine so I don't have to worry about them. The bad news? My white blood cell count is not. Our pathology labs don't often use the red highlighter for bad results but they dug it out of the archives for me. So even though I don't have to have my kidney tests redone, I have to go draw more blood in 4 weeks anyway and hope the problem disappears between then and now. 

On to the funny stuff:
- Despite having objectively moderate winters, my dumb meat suit has decided to object to the cold in the worst way possible. Just to highlight the absurdity of this, our day temperatures range around 16-21°C (which is roughly 60-70°F) while our nights are around 3-6°C (or 37-43°F). So really not that cold. So why is my body blessing me with chilblains bad enough to warrant a 10 day prednisone trial from hell? My toes turn into neon orange stuffed sausages that get so swollen they can't bend while some people in my neighborhood are legit still wearing tshirts. My fingers have a less dramatic reaction but they are also acting up because of it. Which takes us to my next complaint. 

- To supplement the steroids, I am under doctor's orders to, and I quote, ""get warm and stay warm."" My doctor wants me to roll my stiff, groggy butt out of bed and straight into a warm bath with minimum 2 cups of hot anything first thing in the morning. After the bath, I am to wrap myself in as many layers of everything as I can. The layers of winter clothing has upgraded me from sparking static to full on shock therapy. The last time I accidentally touched the sink, my whole hand went numb from the resulting violent discharge of whatever unholy current I'm generating. So I now resemble a mummy who has to vigorously rub down all their clothes before doing anything to avoid electrocuting themselves. 2/10 would not recommend.

- The unholy combination of cold, dry air and flu season fuckery has also made my asthma worse. As we all are painfully aware, RA and its hell spawn meds mean we are every virus's favourite incubators. Apparently, if you're really lucky, that can mean near constant inflammation in your bronchial whatchamacallits (yes, that is the anatomically correct term) which, when combined with mild asthma, results in near constantly narrowed airways. In short, I vacilate between breathing like a person and a steam train. So I've been upgraded from acute relief inhalers to a preventative inhaler. Here's the problem. I have to take two puffs of the thing twice a day and it tastes like a sweaty gym sock that grew fungus. It tastes like how it feels to step in a puddle of lukewarm water while wearing socks. Whoever made this godawful medication better hope I never learn their name and address because I will make them taste it. It's simultaneously spicy and bitter and just as the cherry on top of this screw you cake, it causes headaches and a dry mouth because why the hell not. Why would you do this to people? Seriously, screw everyone involved in making, approving, and distributing this hot garbage of an inhaler. I hope their pillows are flat and that traffic lights always turn red just as they get to them.

- On a positive note, I'm using all this bs as an excuse to make myself birthday brownies as a consolation prize. My dad is diabetic so I usually try not to tempt him with sugary options because I got my absolute lack of self control from him. But I have officially reached the ""fuck it"" stage this week and he will just have to cope. I plan to put both sugar and chocolate in these brownies because life and the universe can suck it. On top of that, my sister is coming over this weekend with the chocolate coffee monstrosity I call the best cake ever. I am fully planning to be in a chocolate induced state of bliss (or a coma, I'm not picky) by the end of this week and god help anyone who gets in the way of that.",2,1751972943.0,rheumatoidarthritis,3,1.0,False

My best friend, who's sorta like a sister to me, kept dropping by unannounced. I love her to bits, but sometimes I just need a little ""me time"" without feeling guilty about it. After a lot of back-and-forth in my head (and a couple of pints of cookie dough ice cream), I finally mustered the courage to bring it up.

We were chatting over coffee, and I casually mentioned how much I appreciated her visits but that I needed a bit of a heads-up. At first, I worried she'd feel offended or take it the wrong way, which is usually what stops me from speaking up. Surprisingly, tho, she was super understanding and said she'd totally get it. 😊

I'm curious if anyone else has had to set boundaries with a friend or family member and how you managed it without feeling like a total jerk. Any tips for making it feel natural? And also, any advice on handling the guilt that sometimes comes with it?

Might not be a huge deal in the grand scheme of things, but standing up for my own needs felt like a mini-victory to me. 💪",9,1751972864.0,HiddenStrength,2,1.0,False

1lulpy2,https://i.redd.it/zn6w71adumbf1.jpeg,“Anxiety Owned Me for Years. Here’s What Finally Helped,"**I Tried Everything for Anxiety — Here’s What Finally Helped**

I spent years in a loop: spiraling thoughts, chest tightness, random mood swings, and feeling on edge for no reason. Meditation apps, journaling, even meds — nothing gave lasting relief.

Eventually, I stopped chasing hacks and got real about what was making things worse (and what actually helped). If you're where I was, maybe this saves you some time 👇

 **This isn’t expert advice — just real talk**

I’m not a therapist, just someone who’s been through the fog of anxiety and slowly figured out how to breathe again. What worked for me might not work for you — but it’s honest, and it’s what finally made a dent.

 **Anxiety is more than mental**

Your brain doesn’t just “think” anxiety — your body *feels* it. Studies show anxiety is deeply tied to:

* **Gut health**
* **Sleep quality**
* **Blood sugar crashes**
* **Breathing patterns**

It’s not all in your head. And you’re not broken.

 **3 things no one told me**

* **Shallow breathing makes it worse** I didn’t realize I was chest-breathing 24/7. Learning to breathe deeper (through the nose) was a game-changer.
* **Caffeine = gasoline on fire** I loved coffee. But I didn’t realize it was spiking my cortisol and mimicking panic. Switching to low-caf or herbal teas helped *a lot*.
* **Blood sugar matters** Skipping meals or eating sugary stuff led to crashes that felt like panic attacks. Balanced meals with protein every few hours helped stabilize my mood.

**What actually helped long-term**

* Morning sunlight (10–15 mins outside every day)
* Walking without my phone — just walking
* Magnesium glycinate before bed
* Less scrolling, more sleep
* Naming the anxious thought instead of fighting it

Anxiety didn’t disappear overnight. But once I stopped trying to *outthink* it and started supporting my body too — it got quieter.

Was watching a coffee shop dude fumble this morning and it was really bothering me. I really didn't want to embarrass him in front of his colleagues so I said nothing and waited patiently. This was a grown man. And it happens so often.

So, small coins first and work your way up rounding up as you go. This is what I've taught my young children to do when they make purchases (the local sweet shop) and need to check their change. It's helped them immensely with their confidence in handling money.",0,1751972718.0,LifeProTips,8,0.31,False

Someone at the bar called him about his car, so he went and took that back home the next day. He was slowly starting to get comfortable again, even though the hair on the back of his neck stood up whenever he thought of that godforsaken night. Memories linger. That's what they do best. He eventually convinced himself that he was just a bit too drunk that night and none of it actually happened. Someone could've spiked his drink, even! Interesting, the capacity to trick oneself, isn't it? And so his days went on. Until a day came— a day that was bound to come, one could say—when he was in his kitchen, grabbing a quick coffee before leaving to go to the club, and suddenly felt like he saw something in the backyard. A pair of eyes staring from deep in the treeline. Now this has happened before, feeling like seeing that creature. Like a shadow in the corner of his eye that disappears when he turns. Like a daymare that haunts his waking hours constantly. But this time, he knew it wasn't paranoia. Because the thing was still there when he looked right at it, its eerie wide eyes looking directly at his face and the long hair covering its body almost completely. The sky was dark. The wind slow. And time unbeing. He stood still, trying to track every small movement of it. The figure slowly retreated into the treeline after a few minutes of nerve wracking staring. Is this how the men who looked at Medusa must have felt?


He finally exhaled, very slowly, scared to even move. He cautiously took a few steps towards the kitchen door. Maybe he shouldn't have been so foolishly slow with each step, because as he reached the door, he heard a scratch. The door creaked. He froze mid-step. Is it too late to lock it? One could say— judging from the horrifying and unfortunately familiar figure that emerged the very next second from the slit of the door— it very much was.


It stood by the kitchen counter like a statue in stone. Seeing it in daylight somehow made it much more unsettling of a vision. He could see the long claws in its wholeness, the locks in the hair, mud all over the body, and the fangs that peaked out now and again as the creature breathed in with widened nostrils. Ryan swallowed with a shudder even though his mouth was dry. The creature smiled with a tilted head. God, that smile is the most terrifying thing in the world. Without a single second spared for him to think, the creature pulled him by his shoulders and started sniffing around. He felt the fangs gracing his skin. He stayed still, not even daring to breathe. It growled hungrily, but the perfume on his clothes seemed to throw it off again. He felt grateful for that. It's the only thing keeping him alive right now. 


The creature cocked its head and hissed in distress and anger. Ryan was mentally paralyzed and fully frozen in place until this very moment. The hiss snapped him back to reality. He tried to shrug himself off the grip of the creature but he couldn't even budge. It was strong. In a wild way. But then the grip loosened. It started sniffing the air. As Ryan watched in slight relief after being released from the claws, the creature sniffed around his kitchen and ended up in front of the fridge. Not understanding how to access it, it started clawing and scratching it. Ryan's muscles started relaxing and his mind got filled with curiosity. Is it hungry? Could he help it? After a few moments of internal conflict, he got himself to slowly approach the fridge. Something (probably not his brain) told him that's a good move. The creature cocked its head towards him.


He froze in place once again, but this time, not as scared as he was before. He watched closely as the creature tilted its head to the sides. It almost looked like a dog trying to understand its master. He took a deep breath. Maybe it's not a mindless monster. Maybe. He wanted to work with that maybe. ""You... You understand things, don't you?"" He spoke slowly. It sniffed the fridge and clawed on it. Then it looked at him again. He slowly reached out and grabbed the fridge handle, then pulled it open gently. The creature sniffed and located some leftover beef he had in the fridge and pulled it out. Then it started eating it. Ryan stood frozen, not wanting to see it eat the raw meet but also unable to rip his eyes off of the scene. The creature accidentally ate the plastic wrap over the beef in its frantic rush and got it stuck on its teeth. That's when he heard the creature make a nonthreatening sound for the first time— a whimper of distress and confusion. He took a cautious step forward. He slowly took his hand to his mouth to mimic the action of pulling something off of the teeth. The creature only whimpered more and retched. He had to make a hard decision. Something not to be made in a hurry— but too late, the man has already put his hand into its mouth. He carefully reached in and pulled out the plastic wrap. He tossed it aside and gently ran his finger along the creature's teeth and gums to check for any more remnants. A trusting sun was dawning in both of their dark eyes.


The creature hissed and went back to eating. Ryan found himself softly laughing at that sight. It finished the beef within minutes and sat down on a chair looking satisfied. It smiled. Again. Why does it keep doing that. He hesitantly sat down across from it, eyes fixed on the little smile on its face, looking content and dangerous at the same time. ""Do... You..."" He started, then stopped as the creature leaned forward a slight bit with wide eyes. He steered himself, scared but comparatively more comfortable in the creature's presence now. He decided to try again, slower. He pointed at the empty beef package, then at the creature. ""Do you... want more?"" He asked with his voice as nonthreatening and friendly as possible. It looked away, as if uninterested. Then it got up and walked to the door.


Ryan's heart was racing in his chest with a mix of emotions. He wasn't sure what to do. Which isn't much of an issue— to be fair— if he knew what he wanted to do. But he didn't know what he wanted to do either. A part of him wanted to stop the creature, keep it there. But another part was terrified of what might happen if the wild side of it came out again. This is what happens when naive men experience one moment of safety with something that could kill them. Humans are cursed with empathy sometimes. As soon as it stepped outside, Ryan let out a shuddering sigh of relief mixed with disappointment. The trees in his backyard swayed, as if calling the creature back home. He had questions. Questions he didn't know how to ask. Questions that even if asked, couldn't be answered. Not in his language anyway. And he didn't know the language of fangs and claws. looked around the room, at the mess the creature had left behind. The beef package, the plastic wrapper on the floor, some dirt, hair... He shook his head and started cleaning up. He was afraid he wouldn't see it again. Little did he know, he would— just not how he wanted to.",1,1751972695.0,u_Razmik_raz,0,1.0,False

1lulnml,https://youtu.be/v5n35qThRHM,3 Very Scary TRUE Off-Grid Texas Farm Horror Stories,"# ""Silent Fields"":

I was 10 years old, living on our farm in Pampa, Texas, when everything I knew was taken away. Our house sat alone in the middle of endless fields, with golden wheat stretching out as far as I could see. The house was old, its white paint peeling, and the wooden floors creaked with every step. At night, the walls seemed to hum with secrets, but I always felt safe with my family—Mom, my stepdad Brian, and my brother Zach. That night, though, safety disappeared like dust in the wind.

It started like any other evening. We were gathered around the kitchen table, eating spaghetti. The smell of tomato sauce filled the air, and Mom had sprinkled extra parmesan on my plate, knowing it was my favorite. The table was covered with a checkered cloth, and a single bulb hung above, casting soft shadows on the walls. Brian was talking about his day at the oil rig, his voice loud and cheerful. “This new pump they brought in, it’s a monster,” he said, leaning back in his chair. “Took me and two other guys all morning to figure out why it kept jamming.”

Zach, who was 14 and always trying to sound grown-up, smirked. “Bet I could’ve fixed it in half the time,” he said, twirling his fork in his noodles. I giggled, kicking him lightly under the table. His sneakers nudged me back, and I stuck out my tongue.

“Both of you, settle down,” Mom said, but her eyes were warm, crinkling at the corners. She reached over and tucked a strand of my hair behind my ear. “You’re getting sauce on your chin, sweetheart.”

I wiped my face with a napkin, feeling a little embarrassed but happy. “Can I have seconds?” I asked, holding up my plate.

“You’re a bottomless pit,” Brian teased, but he scooped more spaghetti from the pot and plopped it onto my plate. “Eat up, kiddo.”

After dinner, I helped Mom with the dishes. The sink was full of soapy water, and I stood on a little stool to reach the counter. The plates clinked as I dried them, and Mom hummed a tune I didn’t know. “You’re getting so good at this,” she said, handing me a wet glass. “Pretty soon, you’ll be running this kitchen.”

I grinned, feeling grown-up as I stretched to put the glass in the cupboard. “Maybe I’ll make dinner tomorrow,” I said.

“Oh, really?” Mom laughed. “What’s on the menu?”

“Pizza!” I said, and she laughed again, her voice soft and warm.

When we finished, I went to my room at the end of the hall. My bed was pushed against the wall, covered with a quilt Mom had made, all patches of blue and yellow. I climbed under the covers with my favorite book, a dog-eared copy of a mystery story about a girl detective. The words blurred as my eyes got heavy, and I fell asleep with the book open on my chest, the lamp still glowing on my nightstand.

I don’t know what time it was when I woke up, but the house was quiet—too quiet. Then came my mother’s scream, sharp and raw, slicing through the darkness. It was followed by a sound I’ll never forget: a loud *boom*, like thunder trapped inside the house. Then another. And another. Gunshots. My heart slammed against my ribs, and I sat up, clutching my blanket so tight my knuckles hurt. My room was dark except for the faint glow of the lamp, and shadows danced on the walls like monsters.

I wanted to run to Mom, to find out what was happening, but my body wouldn’t move. I just sat there, frozen, listening. The house was old, and every sound carried—creaking floorboards, the faint groan of pipes. But now, I heard something else: heavy footsteps, slow and deliberate, coming down the hall. Each step made the floor squeak, getting closer and closer to my room.

I slid under the covers, pulling them over my head like they could hide me. My breath was loud in my ears, and I tried to hold it, to make myself small and silent. The footsteps stopped outside my door. I heard the doorknob rattle, then a loud *bang* as the door flew open, slamming against the wall. I peeked out from under the blanket, just enough to see.

A man stood in the doorway. He was tall, dressed in dark clothes—a black jacket and jeans that looked dirty. His face was hard, his jaw tight, and his eyes were empty, like he wasn’t human. He held a big gun, the kind hunters used, its barrel glinting in the lamplight. He looked at me, his head tilting slightly, like he was deciding something. I didn’t think—I just acted. I let my body go limp, falling back onto the bed, my eyes half-closed. I held my breath, praying he’d think I was already gone.

He took a step closer, his boots loud on the wooden floor. I could smell him now—sweat and something sharp, like gasoline. He stood over me, so close I could hear his breathing, rough and uneven. My heart pounded so hard I was sure he’d hear it. I kept my eyes slitted, watching his shadow loom over me. Then he raised the gun.

The shot was deafening, a roar that made my ears ring. The bullet tore through the air, missing my head by inches and hitting the wall behind me. Plaster dust sprinkled onto my face, but I didn’t move. I didn’t blink. I stayed still, my body stiff, pretending to be dead. He stood there for a long moment, his shadow blocking the light. I thought he’d shoot again, but he didn’t. He muttered something under his breath, too low for me to hear, and turned away. His footsteps echoed as he walked out, the floor creaking under his weight.

I didn’t move, not even when I heard him rummaging through the house. Drawers slammed, glass shattered, and something heavy thudded to the floor. Every sound made me flinch, but I stayed still, my muscles aching from holding the same position. I kept thinking he’d come back, that he’d know I was alive. The house felt alive with danger, every creak and groan making my stomach twist.

Finally, I heard the front door slam shut. The silence that followed was worse than the noise. It was thick, heavy, like the house was holding its breath too. I waited, counting to a hundred in my head, then two hundred, just to be sure he was gone. Slowly, I opened my eyes and sat up, my whole body trembling. My room looked wrong in the dim light—my book was on the floor, the lamp casting long shadows that twisted like fingers.

I slid out of bed, my bare feet cold against the floorboards. They creaked under me, and I froze, terrified he’d hear. But the house stayed quiet. I tiptoed to the hallway, my nightgown brushing against my legs. The air smelled wrong, like metal and something bitter. I didn’t want to know what it was.

I went to my parents’ room first, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. The door was half-open, and I pushed it gently, the hinges squeaking. Inside, I saw them—Mom and Brian, lying on the floor near their bed. Blood was everywhere, dark and shiny, pooling around them like spilled paint. Mom’s eyes were open, staring at nothing, her hand stretched out like she’d been reaching for something. Brian was slumped against the wall, his head tilted at a strange angle. I wanted to scream, to run to them, but my legs wouldn’t move. I just stood there, tears burning my eyes, my breath coming in short gasps.

“Mom?” I whispered, even though I knew she couldn’t answer. “Brian?”

No response. Just silence.

I backed away, my hands shaking, and ran to Zach’s room. His door was closed, and I pushed it open, praying he was okay. “Zach?” I said, my voice small. He was in his bed, his blanket pulled up to his chest. For a second, I thought he was sleeping. Then I saw the dark stain spreading across his shirt, soaking the fabric. I touched his shoulder, shaking him gently. “Zach, wake up,” I said, louder now. “Please.”

He didn’t move. His face was pale, his eyes closed. I sank to the floor beside his bed, sobbing, my hands covering my face. My family was gone. All of them.

I don’t know how long I sat there, but I knew I had to get help. I forced myself to stand, my legs wobbly, and made my way to the living room. The house felt different now, like it wasn’t mine anymore. The furniture was the same—the old couch, the coffee table with Zach’s comic books scattered on it—but it all felt wrong. I stepped in something wet and looked down. Blood. A trail of it led from the hallway to the front door. I gagged and looked away, my stomach churning.

I grabbed the phone from the coffee table, my fingers fumbling with the buttons. I dialed 911, the beeps loud in the quiet house. A woman answered, her voice calm but urgent. “911, what’s your emergency?”

“There’s a man,” I said, my voice shaking so bad I could barely talk. “He had a gun. He… he shot my family. I think they’re dead.”

“Okay, honey, stay calm,” she said. “Can you tell me your address?”

I told her, my voice cracking. “It’s 1234 County Road, Pampa. Please, you have to come quick.”

“Are you safe right now?” she asked.

“I don’t know,” I said, looking around the dark living room. “He left, but I’m scared he’s coming back.”

“Help is on the way,” she said. “Stay on the line with me, okay? Can you find a safe place to hide?”

I nodded, even though she couldn’t see me. “Okay,” I whispered. I didn’t want to stay in the house. It felt like the walls were watching me, like the man was still there, hiding somewhere. I grabbed the phone, its cord stretching as I walked to the front door. I stepped outside onto the porch, the wooden boards cold under my feet. The fields around the house were dark, the wheat swaying like ghosts. I sat on the steps, pulling my knees to my chest, still holding the phone.

“Are you still there?” the woman asked.

“Yeah,” I said, my teeth chattering. “I’m outside.”

“Good,” she said. “The police are almost there. Just stay with me.”

Every sound made me jump—the rustle of the wheat, the creak of the porch swing moving in the breeze. I kept imagining the man’s face, his cold eyes, the way he’d looked at me. What if he was still out there, watching? What if he knew I was alive?

“How far are they?” I asked, my voice barely a whisper.

“Two minutes,” she said. “You’re doing great, honey. Just hold on.”

I clutched the phone tighter, my eyes scanning the darkness. The fields seemed to stretch forever, hiding who-knows-what in their shadows. I thought about Mom’s laugh, Brian’s silly jokes, Zach’s teasing. They were gone, and I was alone. The thought made my chest ache so bad I could hardly breathe.

Finally, I saw headlights in the distance, cutting through the dark. Police cars pulled up, their lights flashing red and blue, painting the house in eerie colors. Officers jumped out, some running inside with their guns drawn, others shouting orders I couldn’t understand. A woman officer came to me, her face kind but serious. She knelt down, her badge glinting in the light. “You’re safe now,” she said, wrapping a blanket around my shoulders. “We’re here.”

I wanted to believe her, but I didn’t feel safe. My family was gone, and the house that used to be home was now a place of nightmares. I looked back at it, its windows dark and empty, and I knew I’d never feel safe again.





# ""The Phantom Strikes Again"":

In the spring of 1946, Texarkana was a town under siege. A killer the newspapers called the Phantom stalked the night, targeting young couples parked on quiet lovers’ lanes. He wore a white mask with holes cut for eyes and mouth, carried a pistol, and left death or devastation behind. Three attacks had already happened, leaving four dead and two barely alive. The town was paralyzed with fear—folks locked their doors, kept lights burning all night, and carried guns everywhere. Whispers of the Phantom filled every conversation, from the general store to church pews.

I lived on a small farm a mile outside Texarkana, Texas, near the Arkansas line, close to Virgil and Katie Starks’ place. Their farmhouse sat at the end of a dirt road, surrounded by fields of corn and soybeans, with a single oak tree in their yard casting long shadows at dusk. I’d known them for a decade. Virgil was a reserved man, broad-shouldered from years of plowing fields, always ready to lend a hand with a broken fence or a stubborn tractor. Katie was warm, her laughter contagious, often bringing over a basket of fresh-baked cornbread when she visited. We weren’t just neighbors; we were friends who shared Sunday dinners and stories about the war’s end.

That night, May 3, 1946, I was restless in my living room. The radio played softly, some big band tune, but I couldn’t focus. My old wooden chair creaked as I shifted, trying to read a worn copy of a farming almanac. The Phantom was all anyone talked about. The first attack, back in February, left Jimmy Hollis and Mary Jeanne Larey beaten and shaken but alive. The second, in March, took Richard Griffin and Polly Ann Moore, found dead in their car. Then, in April, Paul Martin and Betty Jo Booker were killed, their bodies left in Spring Lake Park. Each time, the killer struck under moonlight, vanishing without a trace.

I’d taken to keeping my shotgun propped against the wall, a box of shells nearby. My windows were locked, curtains drawn, but every sound outside—a branch snapping, a dog barking—made my heart skip. That night, around 9 p.m., I heard two sharp cracks split the air. Gunshots weren’t rare these days; folks were so scared they’d shoot at anything moving in the dark. I stood, peering through a gap in the curtains, seeing nothing but the black fields stretching toward the Starks’ place. I told myself it was probably just a hunter or a nervous neighbor.

Then came two more shots, closer together, unmistakable in their sharp, deadly rhythm. They came from the direction of Virgil and Katie’s farm. My stomach twisted. Something was wrong. I grabbed my shotgun, my hands sweaty, and stood frozen, debating whether to check on them. Their house was a ten-minute walk across the fields, and the thought of stepping into the night, with the Phantom out there, made my mouth go dry.

Before I could decide, a frantic pounding shook my front door. My heart slammed against my ribs as I gripped the shotgun tighter, edging toward the door. “Who’s there?” I called, my voice cracking.

“Help! Please, it’s me, Katie!” The voice was desperate, choked with pain.

I flung the door open, and there she was—Katie Starks, her face a mask of blood, her nightgown torn and stained. Her eyes were wide with terror, her jaw hanging wrong, like it was broken. Blood dripped from her nose and mouth, pooling on my porch. She swayed, clutching the doorframe, then collapsed into my arms.

“Katie, oh Lord, what happened?” I eased her to the floor, my hands shaking as I propped her against the wall. Her breathing was ragged, and I saw two bullet wounds—one near her cheek, another at her jawline—oozing blood.

She tried to speak, but her words were slurred, barely audible. “Virgil… he’s… he’s gone…”

“Stay with me, Katie,” I said, my voice trembling. I ran to the kitchen, grabbing a clean dish towel, and pressed it to her face to slow the bleeding. The cloth soaked through almost instantly. “What happened? Who did this?”

She winced, her eyes glassy with shock. “We were in the living room… Virgil was reading the paper by the lamp. I was sewing. Then… a noise outside, like someone stepping on the porch. Before we could move, shots came through the window. Glass everywhere. Virgil fell, and I felt pain in my face, like fire. I saw him… not moving… blood on the floor. I ran out the back door, through the fields, to you.”

Her words hit like a punch. The Phantom had come to their home, not a lovers’ lane. He’d shot through their window, bold as death itself. I glanced at my own windows, my skin crawling at the thought that he could be out there, watching, waiting.

I stumbled to the telephone, my hands fumbling with the receiver. “Operator, get me the sheriff, now!” I shouted. “There’s been a shooting at the Starks’ farm. Katie’s hurt bad!”

The operator’s voice was calm, maddeningly slow. “Connecting you now, sir.”

When Sheriff Max Tackett picked up, I didn’t wait for him to speak. “Max, it’s the Starks’ place! Katie’s here, shot in the face. Virgil might be dead. Send help quick!”

“We’re on our way,” Max said, his voice tight. “Stay put and keep her safe.”

I hung up and knelt beside Katie, holding her hand. Her fingers were cold, trembling. “The police are coming, Katie. You’re going to be okay.”

She nodded weakly, tears cutting tracks through the blood on her cheeks. “I didn’t see him,” she whispered. “Just the shots… and Virgil…”

I wanted to ask more, but her pain stopped me. I kept pressure on the towel, my mind racing. The Starks’ house was so isolated, surrounded by fields and darkness. How had the killer known they were there? Had he been watching them, planning this? The thought made me feel exposed, like my own walls were paper-thin.

Minutes later, sirens pierced the night, growing louder as red and blue lights flashed through my windows. Two deputies burst in, followed by a medic. The medic knelt beside Katie, his face grim as he examined her wounds.

“She’s lost a lot of blood,” he said, working quickly to bandage her face. “We need to get her to the hospital now.”

The deputies helped lift Katie onto a stretcher. One of them, a young man named Roy, turned to me. “You hear anything else out there? See anyone?”

“Just the shots,” I said, my voice hoarse. “Came from their place, four in all.”

Roy nodded, his jaw tight. “We’re heading over there now. Stay here, lock your doors.”

As they carried Katie to the ambulance, she grabbed my hand, her grip weak but desperate. “Don’t let him come back,” she whispered.

I squeezed her hand, my throat tight. “He won’t get you, Katie. I promise.”

But as the ambulance sped away, I wasn’t sure I could keep that promise. I locked the door, checked every window, and sat with my shotgun across my lap, staring into the dark. The killer was still out there, maybe hiding in the cornfields, his masked face grinning in the moonlight.

The next morning, word spread like wildfire. Virgil was dead, shot twice in the back of the head while sitting in his armchair. The bullets had come through the living room window, shattering the glass and leaving holes in the wall. Katie had been shot twice in the face but managed to crawl out the back door, stumbling through the fields to my house. The police found blood on the porch and a trail leading into the woods, but no footprints, no shell casings, nothing to identify the killer.

At the general store a few days later, the air was thick with fear and rumors. I overheard two farmers talking by the counter, their voices low.

“Heard they found a flashlight near the Starks’ place,” one said, adjusting his hat. “Think it’s the Phantom’s?”

“Could be,” the other replied. “But what good’s a flashlight if he’s a ghost in the night?”

I joined them, unable to stay quiet. “It’s no ghost. It’s a man, and he’s still out there.”

They nodded, their faces pale. The store clerk, an older woman named Clara, chimed in. “My cousin in Arkansas says folks are sleeping with rifles now. Some are leaving town altogether.”

That afternoon, I visited the sheriff’s office to check on the investigation. Max Tackett was there, papers scattered across his desk, his eyes red from lack of sleep.

“Any leads, Max?” I asked, leaning against the doorframe.

He sighed, rubbing his temples. “We’ve got nothing solid. Questioned over a hundred people, checked every car on the road that night. We found that flashlight you heard about, but no one’s claimed it. Could be the killer’s, could be a kid’s. We just don’t know.”

“What about Youell Swinney?” I asked. The name had been floating around town—a local thief suspected of worse crimes.

Max leaned back, his chair creaking. “We’ve got him in custody for stealing cars. His wife says he was with her during the attacks, but she’s changed her story twice. Without evidence, we can’t hold him for murder.”

I left the office feeling heavy. The Phantom had struck four times, and we were no closer to catching him. The town felt like it was holding its breath, waiting for the next attack.

Weeks turned into months, and the murders stopped as suddenly as they’d started. Some said the Phantom had fled Texarkana, maybe to another state. Others thought he’d been jailed for some petty crime, or maybe he’d died. But no one knew for sure. The police questioned nearly 400 people, followed every lead, even printed a picture of that flashlight in the newspaper, hoping someone would recognize it. Nothing came of it.

Katie survived, but her life was never the same. Her jaw was shattered, her face scarred. After Virgil’s funeral, she sold the farm and moved to live with family in Louisiana. I saw her once before she left, at the church where we used to share potlucks. Her eyes were hollow, her smile gone.

“I can’t stay here,” she told me, her voice soft. “Every time I close my eyes, I see him falling, hear those shots.”

I hugged her, wishing I could say something to ease her pain. “You’re strong, Katie. You’ll find peace.”

She nodded, but I could tell she didn’t believe me.

I still live on my farm, though I’ve added locks to every door and window. The fields around my house, once a place of comfort, now feel like a trap waiting to spring. At night, when the wind rustles the corn or a branch taps the roof, I grip my shotgun, my heart racing. I think of Virgil, slumped in his chair, and Katie, running through the dark, her face torn by bullets.

The Phantom was never caught. His shadow lingers over Texarkana, a ghost we made real with our fear. Sometimes, in the quiet, I swear I hear those gunshots again, echoing across the fields, reminding me that some nightmares never end.





# ""The Poisoned Calves"":

I heard the cow’s cry that afternoon, a sound that chilled me to the bone. It was a wail of loss, of grief, that only a mother can make when her calf is gone. I was in the barn, fixing a fence, when it reached me—a deep, mournful moan that I knew all too well. I dropped my tools and ran toward the pasture, my boots crunching on the dry earth. As I crested the hill, I saw her by the pond, standing over something. I quickened my pace, and as I got closer, I saw it—the body of her calf, lying still on the ground.

I knelt beside it, hoping against hope that it was just sleeping, but I knew better. Its eyes were open, lifeless, and there was no sign of what had killed it. No blood, no wounds, just death. I called the vet, Dr. Spencer, who came out that same day. He performed a necropsy and found something alarming—grains of toxic fertilizer in its stomach. Someone had poisoned my calf.

That was February 2014, the start of a nightmare that wouldn’t end. Over the next four years, I lost 18 more calves, all in the same way. Each time, I’d find them dead, with no explanation, until the vet confirmed the same poison. The sheriff’s office, game wardens, even a special ranger from the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association—they all came, took samples, asked questions, but no one could find who was doing this or why.

I started to feel like I was being watched, like someone was out there, in the shadows of my own land, waiting to strike again. I’d walk the perimeter at night, my flashlight cutting through the darkness, listening for any sound that didn’t belong. But there was nothing—no footprints, no tire tracks, no broken fences. It was as if a ghost was haunting my ranch, but I knew better. This was no ghost. This was human, and that made it worse.

My daughters were worried. One evening, as we sat on the porch watching the sun set over the hills, Emily spoke up. “Dad, maybe you should sell the place,” she said, her voice trembling. “This place—it’s not safe anymore.”

I shook my head. “This is our home, Emily. Your great-grandfather built this ranch with his own hands. I can’t just walk away.”

“But at what cost?” she asked, her eyes filling with tears. “Your health, your peace of mind? It’s not worth it.”

I didn’t have an answer for her. All I knew was that I couldn’t give up, not yet.

This ranch, 112 acres of rolling hills and pine trees in the heart of East Texas, had always been my sanctuary. My family had owned this land for over a century. I’d grown up here, learned to ride horses and rope cattle here. My grandfather and great-grandfather worked this soil, raised cattle here. Now, it felt like a battleground, tainted by an unseen enemy.

Every night, I’d patrol the property, my old dog, Rusty, by my side. The moon cast long shadows across the fields, and every rustle of the grass made me jump. I’d shine my flashlight into the darkness, half-expecting to see a figure darting away. But there was never anyone there.

One night, I thought I saw something—a shape, moving near the barn. I called out, “Who’s there?” but only silence answered. I approached cautiously, my heart racing, my hand on the rifle I now carried everywhere. When I got there, it was just a plastic bag caught in the wind. I laughed at myself, but the laughter was hollow. The fear was real, and it was growing.

The next morning, I found another calf dead. Its mother was nuzzling it, trying to get it to stand, but it was no use. I could see the foam around its mouth, the telltale sign of the poison. I felt a rage build inside me, a helplessness that I couldn’t protect my own animals on my own land.

I went to the sheriff’s office again. Deputy Johnson was handling the case. He was a young guy, eager, but I could see the frustration in his eyes.

“Buck, we’ve checked all the usual suspects,” he said, leaning back in his chair. “No one’s talking, and there’s no evidence. It’s like this person’s a ghost.”

“I know,” I replied, “but someone’s doing this. Someone hates me enough to kill my livestock, slowly, one by one.”

He sighed. “We’ll keep looking. Maybe set up some cameras, see if we can catch this person in the act.”

But deep down, I knew that might not help. Whoever was doing this was careful, too careful.

As I left the station, I saw Tommy, a guy I’d fired a few years back for slacking off. He was sitting on a bench outside, smoking a cigarette. Our eyes met, and for a moment, I thought–

I saw something—guilt, maybe, or defiance. But then he looked away, and I kept walking. I couldn’t accuse him without proof, and I had none. But the thought lingered in my mind. Could it be him? Or was it someone else—a neighbor I’d argued with over a fence line, a parolee who’d moved nearby, or just some stranger with a grudge I didn’t even know about?

Christmas that year was tough. My daughters and grandkids came over, and we tried to make it joyful, but the shadow of the dead calves hung over us. My grandson, wide-eyed, asked, “Grandpa, why are the cows dying?”

I struggled to answer. “Sometimes bad things happen, son. But we’re working on it. The police are trying to find out who’s doing this.”

Later, Emily pulled me aside. “Dad, maybe it’s time to think about selling. This place—it’s not safe anymore.”

I shook my head again. “This is our home, Emily. I can’t let some coward drive me off my land.”

“But at what cost?” she asked, her voice breaking. “Your health, your peace of mind? It’s not worth it.”

I didn’t have an answer for her. All I knew was that I couldn’t give up, not yet.

One evening, as I was feeding the cattle, I noticed something odd—a fresh set of tire tracks leading to the back of the property. They didn’t belong to any of my vehicles. My heart skipped a beat. Finally, a lead.

I followed the tracks, which stopped near the fence line. There, half-buried in the dirt, was a small bag. I picked it up carefully—it was filled with the same toxic grain that had killed my calves. My hands shook as I held it, hope and fear mixing in my chest. This was it, I thought, the clue we’d been waiting for.

I rushed to the sheriff’s office, my heart pounding with anticipation. But when they analyzed the bag, they found no fingerprints, no DNA, nothing that could point to a suspect. It was as if the bag had appeared out of thin air.

That night, I sat on the porch, staring at the stars, wondering if I’d ever know the truth. The ranch, once my pride and joy, now felt like a prison, trapping me in this endless cycle of death and mystery. Every creak of the house, every howl of the wind, made me wonder if the person responsible was out there, watching, waiting for the next chance to strike.

I thought about the possibilities. Was it Tommy, seeking revenge for being fired? Was it my neighbor, bitter over our old property dispute? Or was it someone I didn’t even know, someone who hated me for reasons I couldn’t fathom? The not knowing was the worst part. It gnawed at me, kept me awake at night, made me question every shadow, every sound.

On Christmas Eve 2017, I found another dead calf. I posted about it online, and the story spread—thousands shared it, offering help, theories, even wild ideas about cults or vandals. But still, no answers. The mystery grew, and so did my fear.

Sometimes, I’d sit on the porch at night, looking out over the land I loved—the rolling hills, the old oak trees, the pond where I used to fish as a boy. It was all tainted now, poisoned by this unseen enemy. I wondered if I’d ever feel safe again, if my family would ever know peace.

But I won’t let this person win. Whoever is doing this, they want me to give up, to leave this land. But I won’t. This is my home, my legacy, and I’ll defend it, even if it means living with this shadow over me. Maybe one day, the truth will come out. Until then, I’ll keep watching, waiting, hoping that justice will prevail.",1,1751972558.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

Think superwoman for a month, super fast blah blah and then the comedown is a b*tc. 

TLDR: Went on vacation out of state to meet my brother in his new house previously I had spent weekends and 4-5 days with his parents and sister and her family. He never stays over although my parents are local, has some weird excuse all the time. Whatever, moving on.

Background: I’m 99% sure the 5+ grand mal seizures with no common thread, all while He has having low blood sugar (fasting not eating til midday), low blood pressure (60s/brachyardia?) lack of electrolytes pumped with IV (sodium chloride stuff) to flush out excess lactic acid to avoid kidneys from malfunctioning at 50% of hospital stays. I felt empathy and offered to call doctors, make appts, find a better neuro, offer my network of best friends~doctors  and rush to help him with referrals and advice saying they don’t think he has jaundice, usually only babies get that, is it possible it’s leftover coffee from when you woke up chugged 2 coffees and decided not to eat your first meal til 2pm? Fast forward to a month ago, he’s acting dopey and depressed and feeling this “KEPPrA RAGe” that I keep reading about on peer reviewed literature. I’m not trying to be his psychiatrist / neurologist / therapist but trying simply to allow to help navigate the stupid US medical system. I think he might be taking too high of a dosage since follow up after hospital stay takes forever to get the RXs sorted out and continued on new dosage which not only doubled but almost tripled, XR to IR and dosage change was insane, what happened to titration !?

Question/End Rant; We had finally discussed things, I was planning our wedding for 2026 solely by myself (~family/friends offered to help honestly I’ve been dreaming of this my whole life and I love making lists and checking things off so happy to actually do it and pay for it entirely no questions asked. Hard work pays off. #blessed  

After a weekend of my manic symptoms lasting a little over a month ~ 7 days no sleep for conditions I don’t need to justify| my ducks  are in order ) and him deciding after a year and a half he’s going to take it seriously ;!^but forgive me if I’m not going to listen to someone with binge drinking issues in the past /borderline addiction! And my previous (decade ago) professional b/g includes working with law enforcement + public health/policy + community outreach with residential treatment facilities + prescription overuse + workin with medical community to alleviate and reduce stigma but find a solution with all the players at the table..spoiler there is none or it’s “evolving”

If in fact he has been truly diagnosed with adult onset epilepsy for his tonic-clonic grand mal seizures cause unknown & lasting 5+ minutes all resulting in ICU + IVs + the fireworks, is there a chance in hell that ME and a guy with UNRESOLVED ANGER and constantly pointing finger at his partner not the people in his life that cause him hell and a manic person get their Disney story happy ending? 

Or should we move on and take it as a loss and split? 

Any advice/ rant/ support would be appreciated, thank you in advance if you read all this word 🤮 and decided to help 🙏

I’m livid 3 years later we are ending this when this is the second time he entered and exited and I saw the red ⛳️flags earlier (first time in ‘21) after losing my previous partner to cardiac arrest ❤️‍🩹 for too much binge drinking. Let’s see I have a type. I also like to self medicate to repress the 19399393 moving thoughts but do it to an effect where it numbs me and I can move on. I’ve always avoided living with or dating depressed ppl because it inevitably leads to mass volcano 🌋 cleanups or never speaking again. ❌

1lullet,https://i.redd.it/41warpj5tmbf1.jpeg,My Les Paul Standard '50s Faded,"A couple of months ago, I picked up a Gibson Les Paul Standard '50s in Faded Honey Burst from Thomann. It was listed as B-stock for €1999, a customer return. The guitar plays beautifully and I absolutely love everything about it. Obviously it didn't win the body lottery like some over the top beautiful Les Paul's but it's still a beauty❤️

I think the reason it was returned might be a small imperfection in the body — you can see it in the photo, there’s a subtle dark mark on the left side that looks like a hint of a branch or twig in the wood beneath the lacquer. Some people might see that as a flaw, but to me, it adds character. These little quirks make each guitar unique, and I plan to cherish every dent, scratch, and coffee stain this instrument picks up over the years.

Yesterday I decided to record something for the first time —two GNR covers using this beauty and my HX Stomp:

1lulkka,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lulkka/after_sight_unmasking_betrayal/,"After Sight, Unmasking Betrayal","Chapter 1

The early morning light streamed through the kitchen window, casting a golden glow across the countertop. I lifted the rose-print mug to my lips, my hand trembling slightly as the steam rose and momentarily blurred my vision. My newly returned sight.

I blinked, focusing intently on the delicate pattern adorning the ceramic surface. Red roses against a white background. The colors vibrated with an intensity that made my breath catch. Three years of darkness had made this simple sight miraculous.

'Red,' I whispered to myself, tracing a finger along the painted petal. 'White.'

The mug had been a wedding gift from Ryan's mother. I remembered her voice describing it to me after the accident: 'It has the most beautiful roses, Sarah. You'll have to take my word for it.' I had smiled and thanked her, never imagining I would one day see it for myself.

I set the cup down carefully, my movements still those of a blind woman—deliberate, measured, cautious. Old habits. The doctor had warned me that my vision would return gradually, that I shouldn't expect perfection. But even this blurry, overwhelming flood of colors and shapes felt like a miracle I couldn't quite believe.

I moved through our apartment with slow, reverent steps. Each object I had known only by touch now revealed itself to my hungry eyes. The leather sofa I had traced with my fingertips a thousand times. The bookshelf Ryan had described so meticulously. The framed photographs I'd never seen.

In the bathroom, I twisted the faucet and let cool water pool in my palms. Then, slowly, I raised my gaze to the mirror above the sink.

The shock of seeing my own reflection made me gasp. A stranger stared back at me—pale skin, dark curls framing a face thinner than I remembered. But it was my eyes that held me transfixed. Brown eyes, wide and uncertain, blinking back at me as if equally surprised by this reunion.

I recoiled slightly, then leaned closer, raising a trembling hand to touch my cheek. The woman in the mirror did the same. Me. This was me. After three years of darkness, of knowing myself only through touch and memory, I was visible again.

'Sarah,' I whispered to my reflection, testing the connection between name and image.

My heart pounded with a wild excitement. Ryan didn't know yet. He had left early for a meeting—or so he'd said when he kissed my forehead goodbye. I wanted to surprise him, to see his face when I told him the darkness had lifted. To finally see the man who had been my eyes, my caretaker, my entire world since the accident.

I left the bathroom without reaching for my cane, which stood propped in the corner where I always kept it. Each step without it felt like an act of rebellion against the blindness that had defined me for so long. My fingers brushed the wall occasionally, an old habit not yet ready to be abandoned.

The hardwood floor felt cool beneath my bare feet as I padded toward our bedroom. The door was ajar, and I could hear movement inside. Ryan must have returned while I was in the bathroom. My heart quickened with anticipation. This moment—seeing my husband's face for the first time in three years—would be perfect.

I reached for the doorknob, then froze.

Voices. Not just Ryan's. A woman's soft murmur responded to his low tone. My newly recovered vision sharpened on the scene through the gap in the door—Ryan's familiar silhouette entwined with another. Long blonde hair spilled across my pillow. Slender arms wrapped around my husband's neck.

'Four years at the Drake Hotel—our real anniversary,' the woman murmured, her voice silky with intimacy. 'I can't wait to celebrate properly, without her hanging over us.'

My chest tightened as if gripped by an invisible hand. The air seemed to vanish from my lungs. The world I had just rediscovered tilted violently as recognition dawned.

Victoria Hayes. The woman who had caused the accident that took my sight. The woman who was supposed to be in prison.

The woman in my bed, with my husband.

As betrayal flooded my vision, the colors of my newly reclaimed world darkened at the edges, threatening to plunge me back into darkness.

Chapter 2

I felt the world collapse around me as I stared at them through the crack in the door. My husband and Victoria Hayes—the woman who had taken my sight, who was supposed to be in prison—tangled in each other's arms on my bed. Their intimate whispers about anniversaries and celebrations echoed in my ears like cruel mockery.

Suddenly, movement. They were getting up. I stepped back silently, my newly recovered vision both a blessing and a curse as I watched them adjust their clothing. Years of navigating blindness had taught me to move without sound, and now that skill would serve a different purpose.

I retreated to the living room, positioning myself carefully in my usual chair, arranging my face into the neutral expression I'd worn for three years. My cane rested beside me, a prop in what was about to become the performance of my life. I closed my eyes just as I heard their footsteps approaching.

""Sarah?"" Ryan's voice carried that familiar gentle tone—the one I'd once found so comforting. Now it turned my stomach. ""Are you awake, sweetheart?""

I opened my eyes, staring vacantly ahead as I'd done countless times before. ""Yes, I'm here,"" I called, injecting warmth into my voice despite the ice forming in my chest.

Their footsteps drew closer. I could hear the soft rustle of fabric, smell a floral perfume that didn't belong in my home.

""Sarah,"" Ryan said, his hand touching my shoulder. I fought the urge to flinch. ""I've brought someone to meet you. An old friend of mine.""

I turned my face upward, careful to keep my gaze unfocused even as I took in every detail of the woman standing beside my husband. Victoria Hayes was more beautiful than I'd imagined during my years of darkness—tall and elegant, with long blonde hair cascading over shoulders draped in what looked like an expensive silk blouse. Her manicured hand rested possessively on Ryan's arm.

""Welcome,"" I said, my voice steady despite the fury building inside me. I extended my hand in the general direction of her voice. ""Please, come sit with me.""

Victoria's fingers were cool as they briefly touched mine. ""It's lovely to finally meet you, Sarah. Ryan speaks so highly of you.""

The audacity of her words nearly broke my composure. This woman had blinded me, and now she stood in my home pretending we were strangers. I smiled, channeling every ounce of acting ability I possessed.

""Any friend of Ryan's is welcome here,"" I said, gesturing to the sofa across from me.

They settled in, and I listened as Ryan spun elaborate lies about how he and Victoria had reconnected at a business conference. I nodded and smiled, playing the role of trusting wife while memorizing every word, every inflection, every pause that betrayed their deception.

After what felt like hours, Ryan mentioned needing to show Victoria some work documents in his study. The moment the door closed behind them, I reached for my phone in my pocket. My fingers, once clumsy with technology during my blindness, now moved with renewed purpose. I activated the voice recorder and placed it carefully on the side table, angling it toward the hallway where their murmured voices carried.

""...the anniversary party at the Drake will be perfect,"" Victoria's voice drifted clearly. ""Four years of waiting is long enough.""

""Just a little longer,"" Ryan replied, his voice low and intimate in a way it never was with me. ""Once everything's transferred, we'll be free.""

I saved the recording, labeling it ""wedding\_plot"" with steady fingers that belied the trembling inside me. This was just the beginning. I would need more—much more—to understand the full scope of their betrayal.

The next afternoon, I positioned myself strategically behind the living room curtains while Ryan believed I was napping. My phone camera focused clearly on the garden patio where he and Victoria had settled on the outdoor furniture—my furniture, bought with my money.

Click. Ryan's hand caressing her face.

Click. His lips on her neck.

Click. Their heads bent together, conspiring.

Each photo was a piece of evidence, each image a building block in the case I was constructing. With every snapshot, my resolve hardened. They thought I was helpless, dependent, blind to their betrayal.

They had no idea what was coming.

Chapter 3

I waited until Ryan's car disappeared down the street before moving. The moment the sound of his engine faded, I abandoned my blind woman's shuffle and walked with purpose toward his home office—a room he'd always guided me away from with gentle excuses.

'Too many stacks of papers, Sarah. I don't want you to trip.'

'Just boring work stuff, sweetheart. Nothing interesting for you there.'

Now I understood why.

The door opened silently under my touch. I stepped inside, inhaling the scent of his cologne mingled with leather and paper. My eyes, still adjusting to their newfound abilities, swept across the room. Dark wood desk. Leather chair. Framed diplomas on the wall—achievements I'd heard described but never seen.

I moved directly to the wall behind his desk, my fingers finding the slight indentation in the paneling that I'd accidentally discovered months ago while feeling my way around the room. Ryan had quickly redirected me, but not before I'd registered the metallic coolness of what I now saw was a small wall safe, cleverly concealed behind his Northwestern MBA.

The combination was our wedding date—a cruel irony that made my stomach twist as I turned the dial. 06-15-18. A date that had meant everything to me and nothing to him.

The safe door swung open. Inside, several folders, a small stack of cash, and what caught my eye immediately—a black USB drive labeled simply ""V\_Hayes"" in Ryan's precise handwriting.

My heart pounded as I slipped it into my pocket, replacing it with an identical drive I'd purchased for this purpose. I closed the safe, reset the frame, and retreated from the office, leaving no trace of my invasion.

In the kitchen, I connected the drive to my laptop—a device Ryan had set up with voice commands for my 'convenience,' never imagining I might one day use it to uncover his betrayal. The files opened, revealing hundreds of photos of Victoria—vacation snapshots, intimate moments, screenshots of text conversations spanning years. Including during our marriage.

I forced myself to look at each one, cataloging the evidence of their relationship. Then I copied everything to my secure cloud account before returning the drive to my pocket. I would replace it later, but first, I had more investigating to do.

I navigated to our joint bank account, entering the password Ryan had created for me—my name and birthdate, so 'easy to remember' for his blind wife. The statement loaded, and I scrolled through the transactions, my eyes narrowing as I spotted a pattern.

Every month, like clockwork, $50,000 transferred to an account listed only as 'Investment Holdings.' The most recent transfer had gone through just three days ago. I clicked on the transaction details and felt my breath catch as the full account information appeared: a Cayman Islands offshore account registered to Victoria Hayes.

My money—our money—funding her lifestyle while I sat in darkness, believing the lie that she was in prison paying for her crime against me.

""You bastard,"" I whispered, taking screenshots of everything before logging out.

The next morning, I called David Chen, the lawyer who had handled my case after the accident. Ryan had always been present during our meetings, guiding the conversation, speaking for me when questions became 'too stressful.'

""I'd like to update my will,"" I told David when he answered. ""Privately.""

Two hours later, I sat across from him in a quiet corner of Intelligentsia Coffee, my sunglasses and cane completing my blind woman costume.

""It's good to see you, Sarah,"" David said, his voice warm with genuine concern. ""How are you managing?""

""As well as can be expected,"" I replied, wrapping my hands around my coffee cup. ""David, I wanted to ask you about something that's been bothering me. The forgiveness statement I signed for Victoria Hayes—the one that reduced her sentence.""

David's pause was telling. ""Forgiveness statement?""

""Yes,"" I continued carefully. ""Ryan said it was standard procedure. That my statement helped reduce her sentence from ten years to seven.""

The silence stretched between us. When David spoke again, his voice had changed, taking on the careful precision of a lawyer who has spotted something very wrong.

""Sarah,"" he said slowly, ""there was no forgiveness statement. And Victoria Hayes never served a day in prison.""

My cup froze halfway to my lips as the final piece of the puzzle clicked into place.

Chapter 4

The morning light filtered through the café windows as David Chen's fingers tapped across his tablet screen. Across from me, his expression grew increasingly troubled, the lines around his mouth deepening with each swipe.

""Sarah,"" he said finally, his voice low and measured, ""according to.............

**Intro:** Raymond has been a bit tense since the events of last chapter, and although some time has passed, he feels that he needs to ensure Thyla’s well-being above all other things. Just one little thing is missing: I’m not sure if he’s asked Thyla for her opinion.

**Memory Transcription Subject: Thyla. Farsul Foster Child. Professional Burden.**

**Date: \[Standardized Human time\] February 12, 2137**

*The world is in balance. I am in the perfect mixture of warm sheets and cold air on my nose. There’s just one problem: something is disturbing me. No, wait, someone is disturbing me. What could they want? Do I have class today?* ***Her.*** *She’ll be mad if I’m late! I need to-*

“Thyla, kiddo, time to wake up.”

With great difficulty, I slowly open my eyes to see the partially fur-covered face of the human man I’ve been living with for a pawful of days now. He gently smiles in that human-snarl way before reaching out and slowly unraveling me from the blankets that I find myself trapped in. Like always, I stretch my arms and legs out, giving my tail a wag just to make sure it’s still there.

“Good morning, Raymond.”

“Good morning, Thyla. Get yourself ready, and then we can have some breakfast. Sound good?”

“I- yawwwwww, okay.”

“Good, see you in a bit.”

He then leaves me alone in the big room as the roller shades slowly let the endless sun of the Venlil planet in and assault my eyes. Despite the warm glow filling the room, him being gone makes me feel all cold again. I yawn again before taking a deep breath to brave the cold air of the room. My feet click on the hard floor as I slide off the bed and make my way over to the attached bathroom.

Inside, I turn the shower water on really hot and greedily breathe in the steam as it flows out of the cracked-open glass door. Satisfied it’s hot enough for me, I step in and quickly use the soaps that Miss Paly said I needed. Soon enough, I’m all clean, but I take another moment to turn my snout into the stream and clack my teeth at the water before turning it off and stepping out into the much warmer room. The dryer wall makes quick work of my damp fur, and I can then go to the sink and brush my teeth like Raymond asked me to.

*Up and down. Left and right. Little circles, big circles. Why didn’t I have to do this before coming here? I guess I did when the school made us every season check-up, but not every day…*

I spit out the paste and fight the urge to wash away all of the spicy, cool taste. Believing that Raymond will be satisfied, I exit the bathroom and make my way out to the main area of the apartment, where I instantly smell that burnt, acrid smell of the ‘coffee’ Raymond likes drinking so much. Just like every morning, Raymond is dancing by himself to the sound of [human music coming from his speaker](https://youtu.be/J-lohQ8w9EQ). He steps this way and that with the occasional spin. It takes Raymond a really long time to notice me, but when he does, he gives another smile, turns off the music, and heads over to the couch.

I quickly follow and sit in front of him on the footrest while he takes the brush also from Miss Paly off the side table and begins to sort through all of my tangles. The bristles of the brush feel like a relaxing paw stroking my fur as Raymond rapidly untangles any knots without hurting me this time. When he’s done, I nearly jump out of my seat, ready for breakfast, and he turns me around to give my head a pat. But it’s a trick; he scratches in my ear, which feels wonderful, but I see him make a scrunched face.

“Thyla, did you clean your ears this morning?”

“Yes?”

“Wrong. Stay there.”

He reaches again for the side table, but this time he grabs two little paper packets, which he holds in his hands to warm them up. He then rips open the first one, and I reluctantly raise my ears as high as they go so he can get into the inner creases. The chemically liquid is smelly and cold at first, but then the citrus smell comes as the wet wipe warms up. Soon the left ear is clean, and then the right is getting the same treatment. I let a small whine go as I lean into his hand and the warm cleaning wipe.

“There we go, nice and clean. For breakfast, I was thinking we could have that chocolate cereal you were excited about.”

*Chocolate… I haven’t had any since that one Founder’s Day treat they gave us at school.* ***She*** *~~Miss Betlen~~* *almost didn’t let me have any…*

“Yes, please, Raymond!”

“You really are excited about that stuff, aren’t you? Well, let’s get to it.”

I feel my face turn blue at the hunger for that food, but I can’t stop my tail from wagging as I follow Raymond into the kitchen. He grabs two bowls and the box of chocolate food. He opens the box and pours out rich, dark brown cereal. Putting the box away, he grabs a big carton of milk that’s very weak compared to the stuff that hospital used to have me drink. 

*Despite me not feeling any heavier, Doctor Seward had said that I could go back to eating solid foods, but I need to eat a lot to make sure I get better. It’s hard to eat so much.*

I head to the table and patiently wait as Raymond brings the two bowls and two spoons over. He sits next to me, and I happily start to scoop and eat the floating bits. Nearly nervous to try such a delicacy again, I savor the loud crunches as the nice bittersweet flavor of chocolate rushes from the grain circles. 

*This is* ***so*** *tasty, but Raymond probably can’t afford to get this too often. He said it wasn’t expensive, but I know better. I-I cost him a lot…*

We sit there quietly again while we eat, and Raymond looks at his work pad. I think of my pad over by the couch that Raymond has put a lot of shows on for me to watch. Some old ones, some new ones. Ones that are really silly and others that are really cool.

*Bark Bark Rollers is really fun; I wish Grandmother had let me watch it more often, but then again, they didn’t watch many shows anyway.*

After we both finish eating and I have drunk all of the chocolaty milk from the bowl, Raymond wipes my dripping chin with a napkin, and we both get ready to go to our destination for the day. 

An orphanage in Star Lake.

*I know why he wants me gone. I compared him to Mother. I even asked for her.* ***Anyone*** *would be mad about that.*

I grab my new bag and put my holopad inside along with a little bottle of water and a snack bar handed to me by Raymond. After he puts on his shoes, he grabs his own bag, puts on his mask, and we exit his apartment and head down to the lobby. Sadly, there’s no hovercar waiting outside for us today, as his work didn’t have one available. Instead, we walk out and head a short way down the street to the train station. Raymond buys two tickets, and perfectly on time, I hear an announcement for the train to Dayside City.

We get on the train, and I feel sick as I notice everyone taking wide paths around Raymond and me. One venlil stares really rudely, and I snarl my teeth at them, which gets them to look away, but not without a mean gesture from their tail. We walk up the aisle, and Raymond picks two seats and even lets me get the window seat to watch outside. Settling in, the train smoothly speeds up, and I take the time to stare out at Mirror Lake City as it fades away.

*I wonder how many times I’ll get to see it again? How long will he let me stay? What if he just leaves me there today? It’s not like I have anything besides this bag and pad…*

My breathing starts to become ragged as my heart rate soars. I close my eyes to try and calm down, but my spiral is stopped as I feel a warm hand rub the top of my head. I quickly lean over and into Raymond’s side as I successfully hold in my tears. I savor my time absorbing his warmth from his arms before he lifts my head up and pulls me back in, but this time I can feel I’m lying against a pillow now. I open my eyes to see him already staring back at his workpad.

*I hope whoever I live with next is as nice as him. Venlil aren’t safe, and I’m not sure even a gojid is. Raymond won’t leave me unsafe. He won’t…*

\------

Despite my short nap while leaning against Raymond on the train, I feel even more tired now as we roll into the town of Star Lake. Unsurprisingly, the large lake on the edge of town is visible from nearly every street corner, though the lake isn’t nearly as big as Mirror Lake back ~~home~~ by Raymond’s apartment.

The Venlil taxi driver has remained thankfully as quiet as Raymond and I have been since we’ve silently drawn nearer and nearer to our destination. One curvy street after another, and my twisting stomach thanks the timing as we finally stop at a large building surrounded by plenty of what look like toys and a big fenced-in yard. The Venlil man announces our arrival back to Raymond and me as Raymond opens the door and gets us out.

“Welp, this is Home for the Herdless. Tell Lox and Silna hello for me. Call me on that same number when you’re ready to head back out. Good luck, little girl; you’ll love it here.”

The door seems to slam like a bomb behind me as Raymond gives me a pat on the head, and we enter through the gate to the ‘Home.’ As we get closer to the front door, Raymond doesn’t even have to knock before it swings open to reveal two…

*Sivkits? Did Raymond say this was a Sivkit orphanage? At least it’s not Venlil, I guess?*

The male one comes off of his front paws and juts a paw out as he introduces himself. Raymond gladly takes his paw in both hands and gently shakes it. 

“Well hello there! I’m guessing you are Raymond, and you are little Miss Thyla? I’m Lox, and this is my lovely wife, Silna. It’s a pleasure to meet you both!

Raymond releases his paw and steps back while tipping his head down to the pair.

“You’d be correct. Nice to meet you, Mr. Lox and Mrs. Silna. Thank you two so much for arranging this on such short notice.”

“Oh, of course we take the care of any and all pups ***very*** seriously. Why, we even have our own pup visiting home today. He’s been very busy, but even a busy boy needs to spend some time with his parents. Now let’s get on inside and have a little chat, shall we?”

As we walk inside the building, I see a mess of toys and things scattered around the lobby but, surprisingly, see no one. Well, no one besides a tan-wooled and blue-eyed Venlil playing something on a noisy pad. His eyes dart up at us, and he nearly moves to get out of his chair but stops just short of standing entirely. Silna’s tail goes into a frenzy as she looks over at the venlil man.

“There’s our son Kailo now. Say hello to Thyla, Kailo; she might be a resident here soon.”

*Son? That’s their son? Oh! I guess this* ***is*** *an orphanage…*

Kailo offers a polite, human-like wave with his paw alongside the normal ear flick before settling back into his chair and shifting his attention back to his pad. I follow behind Raymond and the two owners, but Lox stops me as I try to follow them into what looks like a dining room. 

“Thyla, Raymond and us need to have a chat alone for a while. Now I’d normally say for you to go visit with the other pups, but they’re all at school right now. You can still go talk to Kailo, though; he’s pretty familiar with humans like you and has even been taking some human school classes. We’ll let you know when we’re done, okay?”

*I’m not allowed in? But this is about me…*

I look up at Raymond for help, but he just barely looks down at me.

“We won’t be too long now, kiddo, and it won’t hurt to talk to Kailo. He looks like a very nice young man.”

Accepting my defeat, I again prevent any tears from coming to my eyes, and I slide to the floor as soon as they close the door. I stay there to keep myself in earshot as I notice Kailo looking over at me. I huff as I turn away and raise both of my ears to listen in to their conversation in the room. Surprisingly, Kailo gets up and seats himself in the chair nearest to the door and, by extension, me. I do my best to greet him despite his appearance.

“Hello, Kailo, I’m Thyla.”

“Hey Thyla, nice to meet you,” bobbing his ears in greeting, his eyes flicker over to the door before shifting back to me. “Trying to listen in, huh?”

“Yeah? Why can’t I?”

His tail twirled reassuringly, a soft timbre carrying through his voice, “You can if you want, but it might not be the best idea. Adults tend to talk more openly when they think pups aren’t listening in.”   

“Jus-just go back to your pad.”

Kailo’s tail sagged for a moment before he nodded an ear, “Ok… well, I’ll be here if you need anything.” 

Ignoring the all-too-close man, I again focus my raised ears on listening in to what Raymond and the sivkits are saying. I can hear the sivkit lady Silna starting to ask Raymond questions.

*Questions about me…*

“So, Raymond, who is Thyla? Your email didn’t have much information about her? How did you come to be her foster parent?”

“So Thyla is actually from Talsk and a very recent arrival on Venlil Prime. She was evacuated off-planet during the Raid on the Archives and somehow was shipped here. Somehow she was lost track of, and I found her in very poor health in Mirror Lake City. She did some emergency recovery at the UN hospital there, as it was the only one that didn’t turn her away. When she came to, she asked for me, and I stayed with her during recovery. The hospital had trouble organizing with any orphanages or foster programs, so I was asked to watch her until something could be arranged, and she was okay with that.”

“Oh my, that’s horrible. A hospital turning away a pup in need? I-I guess it shouldn’t be surprising after the Archives Reveal. So many people have used that as an excuse to be so hateful to Farsul on this planet. What have you done since you’ve been taking care of Thyla? What are your living conditions like?”

“I’m currently in a one-bedroom apartment in a building converted for human military use by the UN-”

“Oh, are you in the military?”

“No, my wife is. She’s currently deployed, so it’s been just me there. With Thyla, I’ve given her the bed and bedroom, and I’ve been sleeping on the couch. Things we’ve done…hmm, I took her to Dawn Creek for fur treatment, and then we went shopping afterwards. We… were nearly attacked by a Venlil duo later that day when we got back to Mirror Lake City, and that really shook us both up, but especially her. Since then, we’ve taken it pretty easy. Just staying at the apartment mostly while I work and occasionally taking some walks around the nearby parks.”

*Me being there makes you sleep on the couch, like I should be doing. Maybe me being around isn’t fair.*

“Attacked by Venlil? Mister Raymond, I’m so sorry to hear that. Is there anything else you would like to tell us about Thyla?”

“Things about Thyla? Well, I don’t know her age or really where she’s from on Talsk since she won’t tell anyone. We learned from the hospital that she has a very rare genetic ability that allows her to consume milk without getting ill, and she allegedly has what your society calls Predator Disease.”

*I’m never going to tell anyone about my age or where I’m from. It’s only going to cause more trouble than I’m already in. Being visibly PD is bad enough.*

“Yes, we noticed the scars when you two arrived, but I’ll ask this again in a different way. What is Thyla like?”

“Thyla… Thyla is very sweet and curious and independent and strong. She seems happiest when someone is there to be close to her or talk with her. She likes to laugh when she can, and\*\*...\*\* she just loves to be happy.”

“She sounds like a wonderful pup, full of vim and vigor! Which brings me to my next question. You seem to enjoy Thyla’s company a great deal; why are you thinking about arranging her stay here?”

“I… I’m just not enough. She's really not any trouble at all, but she deserves better than what I can provide. I can tell she’s already been through so much, and I just want what’s best for her.”

*Better? But this is the best it's ever been...*

“Mister Raymond, home placement can be a very difficult and long process for pups, especially ones that are getting close to their teenage years, like I’m guessing Thyla is. How are you sure that you aren’t what’s best for her?”

“I-I’m just not. It’s like you said, being a Farsul is already tough enough as it is; having her raised by a human is just a whole other layer of stigma. If she’s stuck with me, then she’ll never fit in anywhere.”

*Never fit in* ***anywhere.*** *I can never be a real herd member.*

“Well… if you are so sure about it, then we can start filling out the appropriate forms starting this paw. Understand it might take most of a herd of paws for something like this to-”

Their conversation fades into the background as the gravity of the situation hits me again. I let my ears flop to my sides as I scoot myself back against the wall and stare blankly out into the room. The sounds from Kailo’s pad cease, and I hear a sigh.

“Are you alright, Thyla?”

*Alright? I feel even worse than I did before the hospital…*

“No.”

Kailo’s ears droop sympathetically, shifting in his seat to fully face me. “I’m sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?”

*Anything? He should know at least this.*

“A-are your parents nice?”

He seemed somewhat taken aback by my question but quickly rallied, a slight, almost humanesque smile tugging at the corner of his lips as he looked over at me, his ears picking themselves up in a happy waggle as his tail followed suit.

“The nicest, Thyla. If you come here, I’m sure you’ll love it. The other pups are all very kind as well.”

“But I don’t want to come here… I want to stay there…”

Once again Kailo’s ears slumped as he opened his mouth to speak, but the sounds of shuffling paws and Raymond’s boots got me to jump up and position myself in a chair to look like I hadn’t been spying on them. As I expected, the door opens and the three of them come out of the room. Raymond looks even more slouched than he did when we got here, but I can’t stop myself from getting up and walking over to him. I give in to the urge to give him a hug around his legs, and I breathe a sigh of relief as he gives one in return.

“Heya, kiddo. Did you take a look around? What do you think about the place?”

“It’s… okay.”

“Just okay? Well, think on it. For now we need to get going back.” He turns back to Lox and Silna and gives them a wave and a small bow. “Again, thank you two. Just keep me in the loop for this process. Have a good rest of your day!”

Lox and Silna stand up on their back paws as they return the wave as we leave the building. Kailo gives another cheery, yet noticeably meek, ear flick goodbye as Lox sends us on our way.

“Nice to meet you two! Thyla, I wish you all the best. Safe travels!”

As expected of Raymond’s planning, the Venlil man and his taxi are waiting for us at the end of the walkway. Raymond seems to powerwalk as he quickly gets to the door and ushers me inside the car as soon as it’s open. I clutch at my bag back on my lap as we speed off back to the train station for the return trip. Raymond gives my head another rub as I stare out of the window.

“Well, Thyla, I don’t know what food options we have around. How does the meal cart on the train sound? Whatever you want.”

*Whatever I want? I* ***did*** *smell bagged calo before we got off. Maybe they still have some?*

“Okay, that sounds good.”

“Perfect, try and hold your hunger till then, okay?”

“Okay, Raymond.”

\------

Long after we’ve arrived back at Raymond’s apartment and eaten dinner, I sit on the couch and  almost have the next episode of Rollers ready to go on the holowall when I notice him dancing like that again as he cleans what is left of dinner. The dance is similar to the last time but yet completely different. Straining my ears, I can nearly hear him hum an unfamiliar tune as he finishes cleaning up. He looks so much *happier* when he’s in that mode. I set down the remote and make my way back into the kitchen before he has the chance to stop. As he twirls around again, he finally sees me standing there.

“Hey kiddo, what’s up?”

“What’s that dance you’re doing? You do it differently each time. Are you messing it up?”

His eyes and face light up in a smile as he chuckles. “No, no, it’s called line dancing, and it’s different because each song has its own dance.”

*A different dance for each song? That’s too many… Well, figure this one out first.*

“Which dance was that?”

“That was ‘Waltz Across Texas,’ whose accompanying song is almost two centuries old now. Do you want to try?”

*I… I do, but…*

“I don’t know.”

“*You don’t know?* Well, how ‘bout this: I’ll dance, and you dance with me?”

*How does that work if I don’t know the song, let alone the dance?*

He pulls out his pad and is surprisingly quick as he finds the song and then clips the pad on his hip. He then turns to me, stretches his arms out, and makes a grabbing motion with both hands.

*He wants to pick me up? Why?*

Before I know what’s happening, he strides to me and scoops me up into his arms, then [starts the song.](https://youtu.be/Uod0TJCp_TU)

He stands still for a brief moment as the song starts up, but soon he begins to step back and forth, to and fro, while he sings with me in his arms.

>*“When we dance together, my world's in disguise*

>*It's a fairyland tale that's come true*

>*And when you look at me with those stars in your eyes*

>*I could waltz across Texas with you”*

Beyond stepping, he begins to also spin and turn to the soft, slow beat.

>*“Waltz across Texas with you in my arms*

>*Waltz across Texas with you*

>*Like a storybook ending, I'm lost in your charms*

>*And I could waltz across Texas with you”*

He and the song take a moment to breathe as his dance gets more twirly, and he looks down at me.

>*“My heartaches and troubles are just up and gone*

>*The moment that you come in view*

>*And with your hand in mine, dear, I could dance on and on*

>*And I could waltz across Texas with you”*

Whether from dinner or the dancing or the feeling of being held against his chest, I find myself becoming sleepier by the second. 

*I could be like this forever.*

>*“Waltz across Texas with you in my arms*

>*Waltz across Texas with you*

>*Like a storybook ending, I'm lost in your charms*

>*And I could waltz across Texas with you”*

He stops singing and moving as the song comes to a close. I can now barely hold my heavy eyelids open. Using what little energy I have left, I open my eyes as much as I can and look up into his.

“Can you *yawwwwww,* can you do that again?”

He doesn’t say a word in return as he reaches back down and restarts the song as well as his singing and dancing.

>*“When we dance together, my world's in disguise*

>*It's a fairyland tale that's come true*

>*And when you look at me with those stars in your eyes*

>*I could waltz across Texas-”*

His voice and the movement fade into the background as my eyes close again and I drift off to sleep.

*I think I’m already home Raymond…*

1lulgko,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1lulgko/bpd_abuseive_relationship/,BPD abuseive relationship,"I’m writing this because I need to get it off my chest and maybe find some perspective or support.

I’ve been with my partner, Helen, for over three and a half years. She has two daughters, Sarah and Rachel, and I have an 19 year-old daughter, Claire.

From day one, I’ve thrown myself into caring for Helen and her kids. I’ve done everything: been a carer, handyman, chauffeur, emotional support, and more. I’ve cleared her garden, built furniture, helped move house, driven countless miles, cleaned, cooked, fixed things, and stood by her during crises.

But despite all that, I’m always at the bottom of her priority list. For example, I need to register with a new doctor and am running out of medication in two days. I saw a psychologist after waiting four years for an appointment, and she didn’t ask me how it went or if I was okay—she just acted like it never happened. Instead, she needed to get a cake, coffee, and food shopping—things that could wait.

One of the reasons my sister doesn’t like Helen is because she overheard Helen say she would rather eat shit off her shoe than have sex with me. Helen doesn’t like my daughter Claire either—she calls her a “rude cunt.” Helen’s brother even told me Helen was nasty to her exes, especially the one who had a child, as she was female.

Helen is incredibly jealous and insecure. She has over 1,500 friends on Facebook, but I’m not allowed Facebook. She never says “you can’t have Facebook,” but constantly makes a big deal about it. She asks questions like, “Who’s that in that photo? Who are you talking to? Are you cheating on me? Why are you hiding your friends?” It’s exhausting.

Helen always complains when I try to joke or be funny. I used to have a great sense of humor—people told me I should try stand-up comedy. I used to sing around the house, go to karaoke. Now I have no sense of humor, no personality, no joy. My daughter asked me what I was doing earlier, and I said, “Cleaning carpets.” She asked why, and I felt pathetic because I had to say, “Because Helen told me to.”

We haven’t had sex in six months. When I bring it up, I’m told I’m “going on.” Helen says she doesn’t feel comfortable with how she looks naked, which I understand—but what I don’t understand is why we can’t be intimate in any way, and why I’m the one made to feel guilty for wanting to make love.

Everything I do is wrong. I can’t get anything right. She blames me for her eating disorder—even though it started ten years before we met—and for her BMI of 13 and being severely underweight. She needs someone to blame, and it’s always me.

Helen turns into the most evil person I’ve ever met. She says the most vile, horrible things about me when she’s angry—things that break me down.

She always puts on a show for everyone else. For example, yesterday we went for a lovely walk through the woods and had a nice time. But when her brother and sister-in-law arrived, she suddenly changed. She started missing all the things I did “wrong,” shouting, complaining, crying. It really bothers me because everyone just believes that version of her, the one acting like that’s what a relationship should be.

She has recorded me reacting to her abuse—slamming doors, “going a little bit insane”—because that’s what this has done to me. It’s made me very unhinged. I’m not me anymore.

She constantly calls me names like “useless,” “selfish,” “manipulative,” and worse. She blames me for everything that goes wrong but never takes responsibility for her own actions. She will tell everyone I’m a horrible person—how I react to her manipulation—and paints me as the villain.

My best friend and family don’t want me to be with her anymore. They’ve overheard phone calls and seen how she treats me. They see through the act she puts on for the outside world.

Even as I write this, I’m sitting in the car waiting for her. She always says “one minute”—the minute that never comes. If I ask her anything or want to say something, that’s the response I get.

All I’ve ever done is care for her and her kids. I’ve given my time, energy, money, and heart. But when I ask for help once, it’s dismissed. My doctor’s appointment isn’t happening because “there are more important things to do.”

I’m exhausted, hollow, and don’t feel like myself. I still love her and the little family we’ve created, but I don’t love myself anymore.

I’ve given everything to my partner and her kids, but I’m always blamed, insulted, and pushed to the bottom of the list. She manipulates, controls, and abuses me emotionally, yet puts on a sweet act for everyone else. I’m trapped, exhausted, and losing myself.


---

If anyone’s been through something similar, how did you cope? How did you find the strength to walk away when you still love someone who tears you down?

They will likely need to kill two hours after landing and before I arrive (which I feel guilty about but can't avoid unfortunately!).

*By Someone Who’s Lived It*

---

## ⚠️ Quick Disclaimer:

This is **not medical advice**. It’s built on experience, research, and what’s worked for me and others who’ve had to *figure it out alone* in India — a country where adult ADHD is often misunderstood, undiagnosed, and unsupported.

---

## 🔍 1. What Even *Is* ADHD?

Think of ADHD as a brain wired for **interest-based attention**, not importance-based. That means you can:
- Focus for hours (on things you love),
- But struggle to start or finish even simple tasks (that don’t excite you).

It’s not about willpower. It’s about **dopamine regulation**.

---

## 🏥 2. Getting Diagnosed in India (If You Can)

Yes, adults can have ADHD. No, it’s not just childhood hyperactivity.

**Where to try:**
- **NIMHANS (Bangalore)**, **AIIMS (Delhi)**, **PGI (Chandigarh)**
- Good private neuropsychiatrists in metros (but do your homework)
- Clinical psychologists offering **neuropsych assessments**


---

## 🧪 3. Can’t Get a Diagnosis? Here’s What You Can Do:

- Take the [ASRS v1.1 Self-Screener](https://add.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/adhd-questionnaire-ASRS111.pdf)  
- Journal your struggles: focus, memory, procrastination, impulsivity, mood swings  
- Watch trusted content like *How to ADHD* and compare your patterns

Knowing your brain is **step one to managing it**.

---

## 💊 4. Meds: What’s Prescribed in India (When You Actually Get a Diagnosis)

Here’s what psychiatrists in India *might* prescribe for ADHD:

### 🔸 Common Medications:
- **Methylphenidate** (Addwize, Inspiral, Concerta)  
  → Stimulant, improves focus. Schedule X drug. Hard to find.
- **Atomoxetine (Attentrol)**  
  → Non-stimulant. Takes time to work, fewer side effects.
- **Modafinil (Modvigil, Modalert)**  
  → Technically for narcolepsy, often prescribed off-label for ADHD.
- **Bupropion (Wellbutrin / Zyban)**  
  → Off-label. A dopamine-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (DNRI). Helps with focus, low mood, energy.

🧠 If a psychiatrist understands adult ADHD, you’ll likely find something that works — often a mix of meds and strategies.

Doctor may start you with bupuprion or atomoxetine first for atleast 6-12 months. No one will give you stimulants on day one.

Don't ask for it. You will come off as junkies.
---

## ⚡ 5. No Access to a Doctor? Read This Before You DIY

If you’re considering **self-medication**, I’m not endorsing it — but I know how hard it is to find proper care.
-- i have used this stack with noo tropic stack until i was able to get proper meds and care .
I still don't recommend it.
Get proper meds.
### ⚠️ Safe DIY Starter (What some use cautiously):
- **Morning:**
  - 50–100 mg **Modafinil**
  - Coffee or green tea (optional)
- **Evening:** No stimulants — or your sleep will be wrecked.

**Track your vitals, mood, anxiety, and sleep.** Start low. Avoid stacking multiple substances blindly.

---

## 🌿 6. Nootropic Stack (Natural Support That Can Help)

If meds aren’t an option or you’re just looking for support:

### 🌱 Natural ADHD-Friendly Stack:
- **🧠 Brahmi (Bacopa Monnieri)** – Memory & calm focus  
- **🌿 Ashwagandha (KSM-66)** – Stress reduction  
- **💊 Multivitamin** – With B-complex, Zinc, D3, Magnesium  
- **🍳 Omega-3 (high EPA)** – Focus & emotional regulation  
- **💊 L-Tyrosine (optional)** – May support dopamine production

Start one thing at a time. Don’t go full stack on Day 1.

---

## 🔧 7. Systems & Hacks That Work (When Your Brain Won’t)

- **Forest App** + **Pomodoro timer** = anti-distraction combo  
- **Body doubling** – Do tasks with someone, virtually or IRL  
- **Google Calendar EVERYTHING** – External brain  
- **Whiteboards / Sticky notes** – Visual memory  
- **Break tasks into micro-steps** – “Open laptop” is a legit task

---

## 😴 8. The Basics (That Make a Huge Difference)

- **Sleep**: No sleep = no dopamine  
- **Protein breakfast**: Fuels your brain better than sugar  
- **Move daily**: Even 15 mins of walking boosts clarity  
- **Water**: ADHD worsens with dehydration (seriously)

---

## 🧘 9. When You Feel Like Giving Up

You’re not lazy. You’re exhausted from trying to “act normal.”

I’ve been there. I’ve failed, crashed, learned, hacked my way through.  
This brain of yours? It’s difficult — **but it’s also powerful** once you understand it.

Start small. Track your patterns. Build a life that fits your wiring.

I could never find a Supplement Tracker that truly worked for me.  
So… I built one.

What I really needed was something smart — something that:

* detects **negative interactions** between supplements,
* adapts when I add or remove something from my stack,
* and places each supplement **at the optimal time** (morning, night, with food, without etc..)

That’s how the whole app started

**I just released a major update: ⏰ Timeline View**

You now get a full-day visual timeline with your supplements placed around smart anchors, like breakfast, lunch, bedtime, and soon even workout or coffee.

For each placement, you can tap and see **why** it’s there — based on its **ideal timing**, synergies, interactions, and your own fasting/eating windows.

We’ve done tons of testing, and the AI engine is getting pretty damn accurate.  
But if anything looks weird in your stack — please let me know.

# 🚀 Coming next:

**Correlations: supplements vs well-being**

Right now you can log your supplement intake.

Soon, you’ll be able to track things like:

*sleep, focus, energy, motivation, mood…*  
*…and see patterns emerge.*  
*Example: “On days with magnesium, your sleep score is 14% higher.”*

I'm also exploring syncing with Apple Health / Whoop — no promises yet, but I’d love to make it happen.

Also: the supplement database is growing fast (almost 100 now).  
If something you take isn’t in the app yet, just let me know — I’ll add it manually.

A bunch of you already helped — with ideas, feedback, and even early testing.  
So thank you 🙏

The app is 100% free **if you say you’re from Reddit** (just mention it during the onboarding).  
While I’m still building, everything will stay free for the community here.

If you have thoughts, ideas, or questions — I’d love to hear them!

Now I hate myself and don’t know what I should do.,"This all started because I offered my wife’s tombstone a tuna sandwich. That probably sounds insane, so here’s the backstory…

For our first date, Emma and I had a picnic on the beach. I’d asked if she liked tuna, she said ‘sure’, so I made sandwiches. We picnicked *a lot* during our first year together and tuna was on the menu 50% of the time.

For our first anniversary, we went to that beach spot again, but as I handed Emma her sandwich, she said, “I’ve gotta tell you something. Tuna? It’s REPULSIVE. I’d literally rather eat it *after* it’s gone through my digestive system. No offense.”

She’d assumed she’d like the taste before our date, but the second she took that first bite she wanted to bleach her tongue. The problem is when she saw all the love and care I’d put into the crusts and dill pickles, she felt too guilty to spit it out.

I just laughed. And for all future picnics, I *always* jokingly offered her the first bite of my tuna sandwich.

Last year, Emma died on Valentine’s Day. She was speeding home from work because I’d cooked a romantic dinner. For three months I barely climbed out of bed except to shit and eat, until one sunny afternoon when I randomly packed a picnic basket and jumped in the car.

Her grave sits at the top of a grassy knoll in the shade of an elm tree. There, I laid out a red blanket and food. Without thinking, I offered her headstone a bite of my tuna sandwich, and once I realized what I’d done, I laughed for the first time since the accident. So anytime the weather was decent, I went back. These ‘picnic dates’ really brightened my mood, and before long I got on a first-name basis with Harry the groundskeeper.

In August, as I unfurled the blanket, a gust of wind ripped it from my hands and swooped it across the face of a lady standing down the hill. I raced over as she clumsily tried freeing herself, then wrestled the blanket back. The woman underneath had real Disney princess energy, all blue eyes and curly black hair.

Her name was Ruth. She was visiting her late husband, Christian Merry, whose name stuck in my head because my first thought was: Merry Christmas. From then on, when I visited Emma’s grave, sometimes I spotted Ruth at that same spot.

We occasionally gave each other friendly waves. Then, one afternoon, she strolled along the path as I started packing up.

“Walk you to the gate?” she asked.

“Sure.”

On the way past, she touched Emma’s gravestone once and smiled at me. “So what’s with the sandwiches? Sometimes I see you and it’s like you showing off what you ate to the tombstone.”

When I explained the meaning behind the ritual, she said, “That’s so sweet. Christian loved tuna too.”

She faced me dead on, locked her eyes on mine, and said, “Do you ever think grief is…heavenly?”

“…Sure.”

Down the hill, there was a nasty gust of wind, and Ruth did a pretend-dive for cover as if another blanket might attack.

I burst out laughing. Then I asked her to coffee.

That night, the barbs of grief stung real bad. What sort of bastard asks for another woman’s number *within* earshot of his wife’s grave? My friends promised I hadn’t broken any rules, and even Harry encouraged me to put myself out there.

“That pretty lady’s been around here for years. You two would be good together.”

And so, over a series of coffee dates, I poured my grief into Ruth.

“I feel exactly the same,” she said. “I thought I was broken too when I lost, uh, Christian.”

She rarely talked about her late husband, and when she did, she kept the details vague. Some pain is just too raw to share, I figured.

The first night we spent together happened by accident--a dinner date that ran long. In the morning, after I kissed her goodbye, I threw my back against the door and slid to the ground, sobbing. Casual coffees were one thing, but this had morphed into a full-blown affair. I was terrified of visiting Emma’s grave again in case she rose from the dead to kick my ass.

Earlier this year, Ruth had problems with her asshole landlord, so I suggested she stay with me. *Temporarily*. And for a few months, I left the past in the rearview mirror. We even went on a few picnics, although I never made Ruth a tuna sandwich.

Things changed when she asked how we should celebrate Valentine’s Day. The first anniversary of Emma’s accident.

Lemme tell ya, that guilt swung back *hard*. The dirt around Emma’s headstone was still fresh, what sort of husband jumped into another relationship so fast?

In the end, I decided I needed to move on sooner or later, so I made a plan: visit Emma on Valentine’s Day morning, then spend the afternoon with Ruth. I just needed to break the news ahead of time rather than on her death-iversary. So, I pulled out all the stops for a killer picnic. Despite the crappy weather.

On the grassy knoll, I’d barely finished unscrewing the coffee flask when the tears came. I confessed all about my new relationship. About how I’d never *meant* to move on so fast. And how deeply, deeply sorry I was.

Emma’s grave took the news surprisingly well…

In all seriousness, deep in my gut I knew she would’ve wanted me to find happiness.

The only thing left to do was finish a quick side quest: visit Christian Merry’s grave. He deserved to know the new guy in Ruth’s life thought the world of her.

Past the tree, I checked the headstone she usually stood over. A married couple were buried there, the Presleys. I marched around, going in circles, widening my search every time. No Christian.

At the groundskeeper’s shack, I asked Harry about his grave. Harry consulted the notes and then walked me *past* the hill through an alley of trees. Christian’s resting place was further along I’d ever seen Ruth hang out. Weird. But not as weird as what I found next…

According to the inscription, he died on the 6^(th) of October. Two months *after* my blanket blew onto Ruth’s face. Which would’ve meant she’d hung around the grave *before* he died.

At dinner, I casually asked her, “Hey, so, I know this isn’t an easy topic, but…where’s Christian buried?”

She froze, a forkful of casserole halfway to her mouth. “Why?”

“Well Valentine’s Day is the anniversary of Emma’s accident so I was gonna pop by. I thought maybe I’d pay my respects to Christian too.” Keeping my voice casual, I added, “He’s on the far side of the tree, right? Just down the hill?”

“He’s…further down.”

“But then wh-”

“I didn’t like getting too close. Standing over his grave made me sick, okay?”

“I understand.” I waited a second. “By the way, when did he pass? March? April?”

“Why are you interrogating me?”

“I’m n-""

“Don’t you realize how hard this is for me?” With that, she carried her plate and glass into the kitchen.

After Ruth went to bed, I googled Christian Merry and combed through an article about a freak sailing accident.

*The body of Mr Merry, 34, was recovered from the water near a jetty off the coast. Ruth Merry said her husband fell into the water while on deck to check a fishing line.*

The date? August 6^(th). Two months *after* our cute meeting.

Something didn’t add up. But over the next few days, anytime I broached the subject with Ruth, the waterworks started straight away, and then she’d ask me to hold her while she cried, or accuse me of interrogating her. How was I supposed to get answers?

Ruth still visited the graveyard, so the next time she set off I tailed her disguised in a trench coat and sunglasses. I expected her to make for the hill, but instead, she went around the valley and past a lake. In a completely different section, she sat alone on a wooden bench.

I felt like a rotten turd. Maybe visiting the actual grave WAS too painful for her.

As I turned to leave, a man with a scraggly beard sat beside her for a chat. Now and then, they touched each other’s arms or threw their heads back laughing. Obviously they knew each other well.

After twenty minutes, they both stood, and then they shared a weird, awkward kiss. Unplanned, judging by how neither of them knew what to do with their hands afterwards. Part of me wanted to run up for a big, dramatic bust-up, but there was too much racing through my mind. I bolted out of there instead.

What did this mean? Did she lose interest in me? Was that why she never talked about Christian? Because this other guy was a better listener? As strange as this sounds, a massive sense of relief washed over me. It felt like I *deserved* to be cheated on for betraying Emma.

Back home, Ruth came through the door and kissed me as if her graveyard romance never happened.

In the end, I decided the affair needed to wait. Valentine’s Day had almost arrived, which meant I had enough problems to deal with. Hell, maybe explaining the situation to Emma would help me straighten the mess out.

On the morning of the big day, I wrapped two tuna sandwiches and slipped them into a basket, along with a thermos of coffee and some iced buns. I got halfway out the door when Ruth asked me to go upstairs. Said there was a giant spider in the tub.

The bathroom was pest-free…

“Must’ve scurried off,” she said as I came back down. Then she smiled and handed me my keys.

At the graveyard, my heart cracked in half before I even laid out the blanket. I confessed everything to Emma: how I’d met another woman, how *that* other woman met *another* man, and that the whole mess felt like a punishment for moving on too soon.

Unloading my problems made me feel fifty pounds lighter. I wiped away the tears and finished laying out the picnic. Then, like always, I offered Emma’s headstone the first bite of a tuna sandwich.

Since she wasn’t hungry, I helped myself. But that first bite seemed off. Not in taste, just…wrong. My chest tightened. I reminded myself how to breathe. I went to wipe away sweat but my arms grew heavy. I grabbed the thermos and by now my hand was trembling. It’s like I could only suck oxygen through a straw.

I thumped my chest, gasped for air, and finally spat bread all over Emma’s grave. Part of me screamed, *you’re dying*, but a louder part screamed: *you just disgraced your wife’s grave you prick.*

I remember rolling onto my back and seeing her standing there. Ruth. I clawed at the air above my chest pleading for help, and when that didn’t work, I gestured at my throat. Then I noticed the remains of my sandwich in her hand.

Without warning she straddled me and forced more tuna into my mouth. The taste of mayo and pickle made me gag even harder. I needed to stop her. I bit down on her fingers until she ripped her hand away. She didn’t scream or yelp or cry out, just narrowed her eyes at me.

Next thing I knew, she clamped my nostrils shut. In her free hand, she had a clump of tuna, poised and ready for the second my mouth opened.

“You’re not the first, you know,” she sneered. “But you were the sweetest. The tuna thing? That really touched me. Most men can’t love dead women like you do.”

*Dead woman*. I craned my neck back and looked straight up. Emma’s grave was only a few feet above my skull.

I bucked my hips. Ruth flew forward, slamming her forehead straight into Emma’s tombstone with a dull thud. A trail of blood trickled down right above the point where it said ‘beloved wife’, then Ruth rolled onto her side, groaning.

My body wouldn’t quit shaking. I felt like I was drowning as I rolled down the hill, then I crawled right through a funeral procession. A group of mourners, each dressed in black, screamed in alarm. A priest threatened to have me arrested until he saw the shade of blue my face had turned.

The ambulance ride was a blur. My first clear memory: waking up with an IV. The nurses said the first thing I asked was if they thought Emma might ever forgive me.

A blood test revealed that my tuna sandwich had been laced with fentanyl. Inside the picnic basket, they found an envelope addressed to Emma in my handwriting. In it, I ‘confessed’ how no woman could ever replace her, so I was committing suicide via poisoned picnic to honour her memory.

The man Ruth met on the bench, Gavin, said she told him her most recent boyfriend committed suicide, and she went there to visit his (my) resting place. Said they bonded over their mutual grief.

Ruth is denying all of this, obviously. Says I’m nuts. So far as I can tell she’s some kind of black widow who has a fetish for bereaved husbands. The police are still trying to make sense of this mess.

1lul3k6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1lul3k6/should_you_buy_the_zojirushi_micom_water_boiler/,Should You Buy the Zojirushi Micom Water Boiler CD-WCC30 for Your Kitchen?,"I’ve had the chance to use the Zojirushi CD-WCC30 daily for a couple of weeks now, and I must say, this little marvel has revolutionized the way I prepare hot beverages and instant meals. As someone who thrives on morning coffee and late-night ramen, having a water boiler and warmer that delivers precision and convenience has been a game-changer. The Zojirushi CD-WCC30 is not just a kitchen gadget; it’s more like an efficient assistant with features that cater to both practicality and luxury.

**Design That Fits Any Kitchen**

I’ll start with the design because, let’s face it, we all want something that looks good on the counter. The polished, brown finish is sleek and modern, blending effortlessly with various kitchen styles without being an eyesore. Its compact dimensions (11.25"" x 8.25"" x 11.5"") make it easy to find a cozy corner for it, even in smaller kitchens. The wide-window water level gauge is a subtle touch but incredibly useful when you’re in a rush to see how much water is left. It feels like Zojirushi put real thought into designing something that looks good but doesn’t skimp on functionality.

**Ease of Use**

Navigating its features has been simple. The one-touch electric dispensing system is a blessing during busy mornings, offering hot water in mere seconds. And the micro-computerized temperature control system? Let me just say, being able to select between 160, 175, 195, and 208 degrees Fahrenheit has made my tea game unbeatable. Brewing specific types of tea feels like a luxury when you can hit the right temperature every time.  

[Check Zojirushi CD-WCC30 price on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b01m04lr6p/)

Another feature I didn’t realize I needed? The sound indicator that alerts you when the boiling process is done or when the water level is low. Yes, sometimes I get so engrossed in work that I completely forget I had water boiling. This little beep has saved me more times than I can count.

**Quick Temp Mode: A Hidden Gem**

Speaking of features, the Quick Temp Mode deserves its own spotlight. If you’re anything like me and often use bottled or pre-filtered water, this option heats the water straight to the desired temperature without boiling it first. It’s energy-efficient, quicker, and reduces unnecessary steam. I particularly like this feature for its convenience when I’m rushing to prepare an instant meal or brew coffee without waiting for the entire boiling process.

**Energy Efficiency**

Another standout aspect for me has been the energy-saving timer function. You can set it anywhere between six to ten hours, ensuring you’re not consuming unnecessary power. This function, paired with its insulation technology, makes the Zojirushi water boiler feel eco-friendly yet highly efficient.

**Maintenance and Cleaning**

Cleaning this water boiler has been relatively fuss-free thanks to the nonstick interior. I can rinse and wipe it down without breaking a sweat. However, I did notice that occasional mineral build-up can be tricky to deal with, especially if you’re in an area with hard water. Nothing that a good descaler can’t fix, but it’s something to keep in mind.  

**Favorable Aspects**

• Four precise keep-warm temperature settings for versatile use  
• Quick Temp Mode saves time and energy  
• Compact design fits neatly in small spaces  
• Easy-to-operate one-touch dispensing system  
• Energy-saving timer for efficient daily use  

**Drawbacks that Caught My Attention**

Using the Zojirushi CD-WCC30 hasn’t been without its hiccups. While minor, here’s what stood out:  

• Despite the sound indicator, the beep can be a tad too soft for noisy environments.  
• Mineral build-up may require a more frequent cleaning routine if you’re in a hard water area.  
• The exterior, while polished and sleek, tends to show fingerprints more than I’d like.  

These aren’t dealbreakers by any means, but they do temper the otherwise outstanding experience slightly.

**Product Competitors**

In comparison with similar products like the Panasonic NC-EG3000 or the Tiger PDU-A40U, the Zojirushi CD-WCC30 holds its own impressively. The Panasonic model does have a larger capacity, catering to larger families, but it lacks Zojirushi’s precise temperature control and Quick Temp Mode. On the other hand, the Tiger water boiler offers similar features, though its control panel can be less intuitive for first-time users. Zojirushi just manages to balance functionality and user-friendliness better, making it a standout for everyday use.

**Cost-Efficiency of the Zojirushi CD-WCC30**

Pricing always plays a role when investing in kitchen appliances, and this water boiler stands firmly in the mid-to-high range compared to its competition. Is it worth it? Absolutely, especially if you value advanced features like precise temperature control and energy efficiency. For me, it’s been about spending a little more now for a product that simplifies daily routines and adds an unmatched level of convenience.
