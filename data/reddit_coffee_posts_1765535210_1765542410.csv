I look at all these profiles with amazing yet normal people putting in the hard work and getting the results that make the dream before and after. To everyone who has done it please understand you are an inspiration! So firstly thank you all 

Which is why I am here, for inspiration, but that doesn’t get you very far… I know it’s discipline & putting in the work. 

So questions for all; 

what was your key that unlocked your potential? 

Was it all at once or baby steps? 

Did you plan or just do? 

How did you speak to your significant other about starting your journey? 

How did you start?

How did you keep going?

Did you have many false starts and feel like a failure? 

About me for context, and any specific advice that may be out there.

I am early 40s (m), half time dad to a Tween and full time to a new born (comes with a significant lack of sleep and an amazing new partner) 

Work a ridiculously stressful, high pace job as a Senior Manager in Construction Management but still manage to sneak in school pickups/ dad taxi for sports & scouts and helping to maintain a household. 

Also have a touch of ADHD (this can be a superpower or the biggest anchor, think 10 tasks at once but it’s a lottery if they get finished and you a) win or b) have your partner walk in with all cupboards open, pans burning, fridge open whilst you’re cleaning a coffee machine and listening. To a podcast)

I have a good enough home gym set up and understand programming (used to be mad into lifting) but now I just can’t stick to anything, even a 1 lift per day programme gets only 3 solid weeks before it tapers off 😬  

Also love to cook and go through meal prep phases… but the kicker is I have been a heavy evening drinker for probably 15years, usually wine and beer but walk the line of high functioning  hangovers most days (I do track LFT / ALT sometimes great sometime terrible) 

Obviously weight is up and down along with alcohol consumption having good and bad months.

This should be simple right? 

So sorry for the many questions and many words for a first post and thank you all again for sharing your experience.

All and any advice is greatly appreciated.",1,1765542252.0,stopdrinkingfitness,0,1.0,False

1pkqgms,https://www.reddit.com/r/shayy/comments/1pkqgms/captured_by_batlike_cryptids_an_agent_carries/,"Captured by bat-like cryptids, an agent carries their brood. As they grow within her, so does her outlook.","She could feel them *writhing* in her. 



Agent Owens glared down at her abnormally swollen, vast gravid belly. “Little freaks,” she swore. “Let me fucking *rest* already…”



The agent leaned back against the redwood tree, cradled by its vastness. The Pacific Northwest was as cool and misty as the stereotypes indicated, though the vast growths shielded her from the worst of the weather. As for the rest, her bureau’s survival training had kicked in. Even while pregnant, Owens could rely on the bureau’s instructions for survival in the wild. 



Though this was hardly a *usual* pregnancy…



*You should go back*, Owens thought miserably as her brood continued to toss and turn inside of her. Barely two and a half months after the incident and she already looked well overdue, as if she had been expecting twins a week ago… *Surrender to the bureau. They can cut these things out of you. Return you to normal. You can be a woman again, not this… this incubator…*



But she knew better than that. The bureau wouldn’t just send her on her way. It’s why she had resisted returning even after they’d initially rescued her. Best case scenario they’d shutter her in a room for observation for years to ensure she hadn’t been compromised by the creatures. Perhaps they’d never let her out. Perhaps they’d dispose of her just like the monstrosities she carried. 



Another part of her, deep in the recesses of the mind, whispered that the *real* reason she wasn’t going back was because she *was* compromised. Though the things that had gotten their claws on her (their claws… and much more besides) were by all appearances dumb beasts, little more than cryptids, the bureau had several records of seemingly harmless or simple things having effects on human mentality. And the fact that they could impregnate humans clearly gave some link to humanity that went unexplored…



The dark thoughts in Owens’s mind left her shifting back against the gnarled root of the tree and she gasped at a thin, sharp pain on her arm. Trembling, the agent lifted her forearm to see a long, shallow cut gently oozing blood over her flesh. 



Blood… fresh blood…



Her reservations against this strange new behavior had long since been subsumed by the realities of her new life. How much blood had she partaken of? How much more would she continue to?



*This is your own blood, Agent Owens. It won’t add anything you haven’t already lost…*



And yet it didn’t change anything. The scars on her neck, they *itched…*



With hungry fervor, Agent Owens licked the blood off her arm. It tasted sharp, metallic, clean; the brood in her belly lurched harder than ever. *More*, *mother*, they seemed to croon at her. *More…*



*I’m not your mother*, she thought, a notion as desperate as it was factually incorrect. But regardless of her higher feelings on the matter, Owens had no choice to obey. 



She fixed her mouth on her cut and sucked the blood out. She could feel it splashing against her gums and mingling with her saliva; it wormed its way into the cracks between her teeth, staining them penny red. Awash in the sensation of the sharp iron kiss, she gulped it down, feeling it trickle down her esophagus. When she was finally spent, Owens leaned back with a groan. As they always did when she gave them nourishment, her offspring were active beyond words, agitating her stomach to the point where a staccato of bumps showed themselves on the sphere of her belly. 



“Please… just let me rest…” she whispered. Her eyes fluttered. “Please just… let me wake up from this nightmare…”



\---



*”We’ve had reports of several deaths by exsanguination in rural Oregon and the coastal regions of Northern California.” The director sipped coffee as he rapped his knuckles against a projected map of the region. “Reports line up with monsters from local folklore resembling bats the size of large dogs.”*



*“So what, boss, are you saying that there’s giant vampire bats in the region?” The rookie agent who spoke up was cocky and sardonic.* 



*In response, the director wordlessly clicked to the next slide. The blurry photo showed two gargantuan, brown-black furry figures silhouetted against rich-barked trees. Though the photo was not exactly high-quality, it was obvious what they were looking at.* 



*“Yes, agent,” the director said, “that is what we’re saying.”*



*The girl who would grow into the woman known as Agent Owens had always excelled. In school she’d been a sporty athlete at the top of her class academically, earning a full ride scholarship. In university she’d been scouted by the FBI, and from there to the nameless bureau that handled “supra-natural” incidents on U.S. soil. She’d excelled in her training and had quickly been appointed the leader of a small strike squad.*



*“Attacks have mostly been on large livestock like horses and cattle,” the director had told her. “But attacks on humans have been reported and are trending upwards. Confirm the existence of the anomalies and, if necessary, eliminate. Lethal force pre-approved.”*



*Owens had nodded. Giant bats were freaky enough, but still just animals. This was going to be a simple one. Done like dinner. First things first? Commandeer a large ranch that had been abandoned due to activity. Set up a dummy target in the nearby barn, a well-hidden observation post, and a base in the secure ranch house.* 



*Foolishly, she hadn’t bothered to check the house’s attic. None of them had. Why would they? There were no reports of the beasts invading domiciles and no sign of broken windows or any other entry. No one had any reason to believe they had made their way inside.*



*At least not until they swooped down in the dark.* 



*God, how many had there been? The roar of gunfire and the gust of flapping wings had woken Owens from her slumber. By the time she grabbed her sidearm they’d already broken down the unlocked bedroom door. They weren’t just the size of large dogs, they had the strength to match.* 



*In the darkness they were like churning shadows, visible as vague umbral shapes rushing through the night. Owens shot once, her bullet ripping through one’s wing membrane; the muzzle flash momentarily lit the room, displaying a pair flat-nosed visages like hellishly large rodents gifted the worst aspects of porcine features. The bats bullrushed her, pinning her onto the bed with limbs far stronger than they had any right to be and the weight of two combined. Owens struggled to free herself and tried to angle her gun at the creatures, but she could get no good shot; she inadequately opened fire widely, her bullet smashing through the glass-paned window. Then one of them pressed its weight against her forearm and she inadvertently dropped it.* 



*She could hear the other two members of her squad crying out from other rooms amidst the sound of more activity. One was clearly screaming in fearful anger, the other was moaning in what sounded like pain and sounded weaker by the minute.*



*The foremost of the bats pinning her leaned its head over her, its ugly squat nose snuffling. It opened its mouth and in the dim light Owens saw the gentle glint of white teeth, a mouthful of them as long and pointed as human’s incisors. It lowered its mouth to her face and she smelled its breath, like a day-old abattoir; she felt sick. Perversely, it was like the beast was going in for a kiss…*



*But it wasn’t. Instead the bat nipped the crook of her neck, the spot where it met her shoulder. It was a shallow bite and one that thankfully didn’t endanger her jugular or other arteries, but the blood still flowed fresh and clean and the beast eagerly lapped it off her skin.*



*Its tongue felt perversely like that of a dog; long and broad and flat and warm, and positively oozing with saliva. As part of the pre-mission report, Owens had read that vampire bat saliva possessed an anticoagulant effect that kept the blood flowing. But she never could have anticipated that these beasts’ saliva had another quality as well; it was paralytic and fast-acting. Owens wheezed as her whole body seized up. She could feel everything that was happening to her, but could move nothing more than her eyes and expel weak, groaning cries. By now the noise of her two agents had quieted as well. The bats were going to feed…*



*Except she had no clue what else they had in store for her. While one lapped her blood, the other would indulge a different form of hunger. With strong claws, the lower of the two bats scrabbled angrily at the dark black trousers Owens wore as part of her typical “government MIB” look. Finally the button snapped off and the beast managed to yank down her trousers and underwear.*



*Even here, Owens hadn’t figured out what was about to happen to her. She thought it would go for the artery in her thigh; when it snuffled close to the fork of her legs she assumed this must be the end.* 



*But then something entirely unexpected happened: a mysterious, foreign warmth touched her womanhood.* 



*Owens’s eyes widened and even paralyzed as she was she managed a singular, shocked wheeze.* 



*Oh God. It was… they were…*



*“Nnnnnn—“ she moaned, unable to articulate anything more. Fear and desperation braided together in her alongside a new sensation, wholly unwanted: arousal. Her body didn’t understand that it was a beast, a cryptid, that was doing this to her. All it knew was that it felt good.* 



*Treacherous. That was the word for it. As the foremost of the beasts continued to lick at her throat, drinking her lifeblood eagerly, the one below licked at her womanhood. A broad, warm tongue flashed across her labia and kneaded pleasure into her. It radiated out of her groin and into the rest of her, riding her veins like highways. Her muscles tensed and sweat headed on her skin; her hearteate quickened, and not just from fear.* 



*This couldn’t be happening.* 



*After a few minutes of lapping at her, the lower cryptid lifted its head from her muff. Its muzzle was slick and wet from her own juices and its eyes searched her body, questing with lustful hunger. Its gaze lingered in places it shouldn’t have—the flush of her cheeks, the swell of her breasts. Fear whipped through Owens’s mind. This was just an animal, right? Then why was it looking at her like this? Why was it…?*



*The creature lifted its body a little higher and the bitter truth revealed itself. Sprouting between its hind legs was a vivid cock, so deeply red it was almost purple. Canine in shape and size, complete with a fat knot near the base, thin liquid was trailing out of the tip.* 



*As the beast lined up with its prey, Owens wanted to scream—DON’T! YOU CAN’T! YOU MUSTN’T! But all that emerged was quiet, pathetic whimpers. She was pinned and paralyzed and weak from blood loss. She could do nothing but… but watch as the creature had its way…*



*And have its way it did. It plunged inside, uncompromising as only a beast could be; uncaring of foreplay or the ideas of Owens’s readiness.* 



*Oh God, she ached to take it. The massive shaft pressed against her and then forced her to part. With paralysis still whipping through her body, she had no control over her response. Her body reacted on autopilot. She clenched and squeezed, making the massive invader stand out that much more against her; the beast chirred pleasantly, happy to feel her body rewarding it. Bracing itself around her, it bucked again, harder; the pressure was so ferocious that it caused the ranch bed’s backboard to clatter against the wall. The beast at her throat had stopped licking and was watching the tryst unveil with interest; in the other room, the voices of Owens’s two agents had stilled forever. Both male, they were useful to the beasts for nothing but blood, and had already been exhausted of it.* 



*With bestial energy, the cryptid had its way. Paralyzed, Owens could do nothing but take it. Her cunt ached and her flesh shivered, and despite herself there was a quickening of the pace and a blooming of the flesh that betrayed her. She didn’t want to like this, but her body gave her no choice. The repeating sense of the beast thrusting into her melted from a distracting soreness to something deeper, a low burning feeling of enjoyment that made her flesh tingle and her fingertips burn. Oh God. Was she really going to orgasm from being used, being raped by a beast?!*



*“Nnnnn!” Owens murmured incoherently, tears flecking her eyes. She wanted this to end. For the beast to satisfy itself before her body betrayed her utterly. She couldn’t cum from this… she mustn’t. Anything but that.* 



*But it was not to be. The throbbing cock plunged deep into her and the fat knot knocked against her. Woth trepidation, Owens realized it was going to push in—tying them together. The beast snarled triumphantly and bucked in again, and again—and then the knot sank home.* 



*The spread, larger than anything she’d ever taken, was enough to break her. The strain snapped through her, accompanied by the sharpest orgasm of her life. A split second later, the monster’s shaft throbbed inside and she felt hot, wet seed spilling into her most intimate reaches. The beast held against her, panting, and then slumped, tied to its mate by its still-pumping knot. Finding the trickle of blood at her throat, her violator lazily lapped at her. From the other room, more beasts emerged, their snouts and muzzles splashed crimson with the blood of Owens’s fallen comrades. They were male too, as evidenced by the lengths between their legs, and were clearly also interested in their catch.*



*As the newly-applied paralytic sensation of venom seized her body up, Owens realized that her ordeal was only just beginning. The beast tugged at her and its knot yanked her womanhood. She whined. It was too big to leave, but the beast still wanted to. It yanked again. She whined. As soon as it was out, its cohorts would take sloppy seconds.* 



*This she knew.*



\---



Down below, a doe tracked through the ravine. Owens waited above and dropped the heavy rock with perfect timing. The deer went down immediately, a fast and clean death. 



The smell of blood danced through the air. It made her salivate. 



Carefully, the pregnant woman clambered down the side of the ravine. Her vast, gravid stomach was an obstacle, but one that had become second nature to her in recent weeks. In quieter times when she had her thoughts to herself, the realization of how familiar her status had gotten horrified her. Now, however, she was just hungry—hungry for blood to energize herself and her brood. 



She alit on the ravine floor with a *whuff* of breath. Not only was her stomach larger, but her breasts were sore and milk-heavy, and even her hips had become rounder. She was the very image of a mother-to-be. 



Never mind that her children were bestial monsters, just like their sire. 



Owens made her way to the fallen doe and quickly slurped up the blood. She would eat the meat too, of course, but the blood—raw fluid, nourishing and lifegiving—called to her. Her body spiked with triumph as she gulped it down, and her brood churned and tumbled and maneuvered sharp in her womb at it. They stole most of what Owens ate; the umbilical was a chain that meant she couldn’t escape them. Whatever blood she swallowed was siphoned to them, and they writhed within her, energized. Her only purpose was to shield and nourish them. 



After what had to be a liter or more of blood, the pups in her belly finally quieted, satisfied, and Owens turned her attention to the meat. She used a survival knife pilfered from one of her ‘rescuers’ to slice ribbons of flesh and gulped them down. Raw meat was supposed to be bad for humans but she digested it no problem. But with the brood in her belly and her new sanguine appetite, did she really count as human anymore?



Flashes of recollection tramped through her mind as she ate. The weeks she’d spent as those creatures’s plaything, constantly paralyzed from their attentions and servicing them a half-dozen times or more a day. Being force-fed prey they hunted from the nearby farms or forests, granting her a taste for raw meat. 



The horror, the *horror* of noticing the impossible—of seeing her belly swell in a fashion that couldn’t be blamed on her new diet, compounded with the stirrings of the new life within. Pregnant with more of these *things.* Reduced to an incubator, a living cradle for a brood of cryptid pups. 



Oh, how fast she’d grown. 



Rescue had come far too late. A month into her captivity at least, by which time she was visibly pregnant and could feel the weight of her litter nestled behind her navel. She still recalled the looks of shock and disgust on her fellow agents when they’d found her; nude, swollen, debased. That night, not trusting her treatment at the hands of the bureau, she’d escaped. She told herself it was for her own good, not because the creatures had compromised her. She’d only partially believed it then. She barely believed it now. 



Finished with the doe, Owens carved bones out of the carcass and snapped them to suck the marrow clean. The rest she’d leave for scavengers to pick through. As she ate, she rested one hand on the curve of her stomach. The pups within pushed back against her, the movements like tiny quakes against her palms. 



The feelings they instigated in her were indescribable. The sensation of fierce protectiveness—her young, her offspring, her *brood—*were counterbalanced by remembrance of how, exactly, they’d arrived to be there. She vividly recalled the sensation of taking monster cock. Of despairing at the breedings. The rapes. 



What a melange of emotion. Maternal, violated, maternal *because* violated. Deep down Owens knew she ought to be horrified. That she ought to find the agents who were doubtless still searching for her in the forest. (They’d never find her. She was the best in the bureau’s history at wilderness survival, and that was before she had maternal instinct demanding perfection of her.) 



She knew that the things she carried inside of her were abominations. If brought to term, if birthed, they would prey on livestock and people. Her sons might well find another human just like their mother and rut her full of pups. She was *compromised.* She had to accept it. 



But she couldn’t act on it. Her instincts, the wordless impulses that drove her onward, were too powerful to shake. She was a slave to them, now. A slave to the beasts. A slave to her brood. 



The scar on her neck, the place where her feral violators had kissed her, itched. She rubbed a finger against it. The healed skin was thinner and she imagined that she could feel the lifeblood pulsing underneath. When it grew hard to hunt, she could always find more blood to nourish the pups in her belly. 



Oh yes.



\---



Three months and change after the disastrous night at the ranch house, Owens’s hunt for more prey was interrupted by a sharp twinge in her belly. She hissed in surprise. Was it happening? Was it—



The twinge returned, stronger and more insistent, and she groaned as she felt herself slipping into the thrall of instinct. Labor was upon her. 



Okay. Okay. 



Half-waddling, half-limping from her hunting spot, Owens returned to the shelter she’d made for herself—a hollow on the bank of a stream, covered with overhanging roots of a streambank tree, the interior lifted up to avoid incursions from the water. She crawled inside; the interior was snug, warm, humid. Just like an amnion. They would find it comfortable and familiar. 



Instinct told her to rest on hands and knees and she obeyed, panting like a bitch in heat. Her belly lurched and she felt the first pup settle into her birthing canal. It was smaller than a human infant but still far larger than anything she’d experienced before, cock included. Grunting, gasping, the agent breathed hot and shallow breaths in time to her heartbeat and slowly squeezed it out, feeling herself part all the way. 



The beast broke free and plopped against the sandy floor of the den. A single umbilical connected it to her womanhood; she would sever this later with a stone or her knife. (Not teeth. She was no animal.)



Feeling the next pup settle in to be born, Owens grabbed her firstborn and cradled him (he was male; she suspected they all were, relying on other mammals, humans included, to nurture their brood) to her chest. 



He snuffled at her teat but did not take it in mouth. What he wanted was richer than milk. 



Of course. Her body had developed milk because that’s what a human child would need; it didn’t understand it would be made to serve something wilder. With one long fingernail, Owens scratched her breast near the areola. Thin blood began beading there. The pup squeaked and scrabbled and she held him up and he began to nurse, not milk but blood. Pressure rocked her body and she pushed as the next offspring began inching forward to be born. 



Already, Owens was planning the future. She would lead her brood in incursions against prey of the forest, against livestock and cattlemen, against the agents still hunting them. There were plenty of females for her offspring to sire their own brood upon. Cattle, does, ranchers’ wives… the possibilities were endless. And if her offspring failed to find a female when they matured? Well, Owens herself was still fertile. She would happily serve.



Once the thought would have repulsed her. Now it came to her as second nature. With every push and quake as her second pup inched to be born, any old reservations were quieted forever. This was what she was, now. A vessel for brood. A mother to cryptids. A warm pussy, a safe womb, and a spigot, as necessary, to provide blood.



The second pup plopped free. He too was male. She was already blushing at the thought of carrying his offspring. Her sons, her *sins*, they would define her. She didn’t mind. After all, there were plenty of other women to share them with. ",1,1765541850.0,shayy,1,1.0,False

when you buy a coffee, it says “each coffee gives you 8 more energy bars,” but we currently have a 5-bar energy system. does that mean the extra 3 bars are still added on top of the 5, since 5 is the new base?

another thing: if i use a coffee and get 8 bars, then spend a few (let’s say i’m down to 3) and use another coffee, does the energy stack (so i’d have 11 actions), or do the leftover bars get lost? and is there a limit to how many coffees you can use at the same time?

Finding a truly unique and original gift becomes a yearly challenge, but fear not—ADNTRO is here to make it effortless for you to dazzle and delight with something truly extraordinary: **a DNA test!**

Take advantage of our **20% discount** using the code **XMAS20**. Consider it our way of feeling a bit like Santa 🎅

# Gift a journey to the origins

If you've ever heard about DNA tests, it's likely been associated with discovering our [**origins and ancestry**](https://adntro.com/en/test-dna-genetic-report-origin/). Any of the [ADNTRO Kits](https://adntro.com/en/) allows you to find out what we're made of, our **connections with populations around the world** and discover which traits we share, among other interesting details. They don't tell us where we're going, but they do tell us where we come from.

Do your loved ones have **European, African, Asian**, or a unique combination of roots? A DNA test can unveil fascinating details about their genetic heritage.

# Gift a healthier lifestyle

Did you know that our genetics can provide valuable information about the **foods** that suit us best or worst, the **sports** most recommended for us, and even our specific needs for **vitamins and minerals**?

Our genes are responsible for controlling how we digest, absorb and use nutrients, that's why with our tests, we are able to discover **intolerances** genetically based (**lactose, gluten and fructose intolerance**), as well as **allergies** genetic basis.

The truth is, ADNTRO's nutrition section could fill many blogs, but let me summarize some of the most interesting aspects that we can uncover with just a saliva sample:

* Speed of **metabolism** compared to the population average
* Predisposition to **obesity**
* Recommended foods
* Recommended diet in case of wanting to **lose weight**
* Tendency to have appropriate levels of **cholesterol and triglycerides**

If, while reading this section, you thought of **that person who always has issues with their diet or is constantly seeking a change**, with our [Nutrigenetic Report](https://adntro.com/en/genetic-nutritional-test-report/), they will no longer have excuses for not nourishing their body as it deserves.

# Gift prevention

A healthy life is one of the most important things we can have, and we wish it not only for ourselves but also for our loved ones. We understand that these topics can be sensitive, but **in the case of many diseases, prevention can be the key to a successful outcome**.

With the **ADNTRO Premium Kit**, we provide access to genetic information related to **health**, analyzing risk variants to understand each individual's predisposition to different diseases compared to the reference population.

This report is particularly useful for understanding if we have a **high predisposition to certain diseases**, allowing us to take proactive measures by consulting a doctor for early detection. It can also help us determine if there's a predisposition to inherit a disease that is present in our family history.

Now, if you're thinking of gifting an ADNTRO DNA test for Christmas to someone who prefers not to know about diseases, don't worry, because **they can choose not to have access to this information if they wish**.

# Gift exploring personality traits

Have you ever been told something along the lines of ""that's just the way I am and I can't change""? Well... maybe they weren't entirely wrong. The **ADNTRO personality report** allows to know genetic information related to the personality of each of us.

While environment and personal work influence the way we are, genetics also plays a fundamental role in our personality. But how is it possible to have this information? Well, thanks to **studies with identical twins adopted by different families** (same genetics, different environment), which demonstrate the importance of genetics in a person's behavior.

In this section, we analyze intriguing aspects such as our **risk predisposition**, susceptibility to certain **addictions** (tobacco, cannabis, alcohol, coffee...), and **hormone levels** such as dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, and endorphins.

To define genetic personality, we rely on two models: the **NEO-FFI model** of the Big Five factors (agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, emotional stability, and openness to experience); and the **MBTI model**, which provides information about whether we are more or less leaders, charismatic, direct, and a myriad of other qualities.

We wanted to end with the most entertaining part of ADNTRO because we love being able to provide knowledge and prevention, but without forgetting the entertaining side of our DNA. Our innovative studies allow you to discover aspects that you would never think could define our DNA.

How does our body react to a **mosquito bite**? What is our **response to pain**? Are we more of a night or day person? Are we genetically predisposed to **snoring**?

That special person you care about and will receive our test will also have their own **Genetic Bonsai**, something entirely unique created from their DNA; enjoy **'The Game of Life by Conway'**, the world's first DNA-based game; and even **communicate with their own DNA through GeneAI** if they decide to join the ADNTRO Community.

1pkqdgx,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1pkqdgx/christmas_magic/,Christmas Magic,"Growing up, my house was not a peaceful place. It was the kind of chaos people lean in for when you talk about it. Holes punched in walls. Police cars flashing red and blue in the driveway. Fists colliding with noses. Hands tightening around throats until the room went dim at the edges. Tension clung to every surface, as stale and ever-present as the cigarette smoke that yellowed the walls. Long silences followed the shouting. Silences that felt heavier than the violence itself. The constant understanding that one wrong sentence, one poorly timed breath, could fracture everything again.

Except on Christmas. Christmas was different. Somehow, every December 25th, my parents called a truce. It was never announced. There were no apologies exchanged, no promises made. It simply arrived, quiet and fragile, like a ceasefire no one trusted but everyone obeyed. As if both of them woke up and remembered a version of themselves who once wanted a family, and decided to play that role for one full day.

That day felt magical.

I would wake so early not to rush to the tree like all of the other kids. No I would wake with my heart racing, and lie perfectly still in my bed… listening. Not for shouting. Not for the low, dangerous murmurs that meant something was about to explode. But for sounds that meant safety. The clink of coffee cups. The soft hum of Randy Travis’ Christmas album floating through the house. Footsteps that moved without rage in them. Even the air felt warmer, like the walls themselves had decided to rest.

We weren’t rich. The tree was never extravagant. But the number of presents was overwhelming… almost one for every punch thrown that year, as if guilt could be wrapped in shiny paper and stacked beneath pine needles. And I didn’t care. Christmas wasn’t about what was under the tree. It was about what wasn’t in the house.

No bloodshed. No 911 calls. No slammed doors. No bruises blooming by morning. No walking on eggshells so carefully you forget how to stand.

Just peace.

My parents spoke softly to each other, like strangers trying not to ruin a first impression. Their smiles were careful, brittle, like glass ornaments hung too close together. We sat at the table without my stomach knotting in anticipation. We laughed the real laughter, the kind that startled me every time it happened, like I wasn’t sure we were allowed to do that.

As a kid, I lived for that day.

I counted down to Christmas like all kids, but not for the same reasons. Santa wasn’t my favorite part. I treated it like proof that another life was possible. That this, this version of us could exist if everyone just tried hard enough. Every year, I believed maybe this time it would stick. Maybe the peace would last past midnight. Maybe love would outlive the holiday.

It never did.

By December 26th, the magic evaporated. The house slipped back into itself like a bruise darkening. Christmas became sacred because it was rare. Peace became something seasonal. Temporary. Something you learned not to trust.

And then I grew up.

I built a life that looks nothing like the one I came from. I chose calm deliberately. I chose stability with intention. I chose a home where voices don’t rise, where love doesn’t come with conditions, where silence feels safe instead of threatening.

Now, Christmas feels… different.

It’s still warm. Still cozy. Still full of good food and soft lights. But the anticipation doesn’t ache anymore. The desperation is gone. The hope that this one day will save me no longer lives in my chest.

And for a while, that made me sad.

I wondered if I’d lost something. I wondered if I lost that childlike magic people talk about. I wondered why Christmas felt so ordinary in my life now, why it blended into the rest of my peaceful days.

Then it hit me. Christmas feels ordinary because peace is no longer rare.

What once made December 25th shimmer wasn’t the holiday itself it was the contrast. The relief. The way calm felt miraculous because it was borrowed and brief. Now, calm is my baseline. Joy isn’t something I wait for once a year. It’s something I wake up beside.

The magic didn’t disappear. It expanded.

Christmas taught me what peace felt like long before I knew how to name it. It showed me what I deserved before I had the language to ask for it. And maybe that’s why I chased it so fiercely as an adult and why I refused to recreate the chaos I survived. So now, when Christmas comes, I don’t cling to it like a lifeline. I sit in the quiet I built, and I think gently of that child who listened for safety in the dark.

You were right to love this so much.

I’ve been brewing V60 and Chemex for a while using a standard borosilicate glass kettle (not a gooseneck). I stick with glass because I'm paranoid about plastic smells or metallic tastes in my water.

However, I know I’m holding my brews back. Trying to control the flow rate with a wide-spout glass kettle is a nightmare. I know I need to upgrade to a proper electric gooseneck.

The Dilemma: Since high-quality glass goosenecks don't really exist, I have to switch to stainless steel. I’ve narrowed it down to the Fellow Stagg EKG (the classic choice) or the Saki Baristan.

I’m leaning slightly toward the Saki because they explicitly advertise a ""zero plastic"" interior (no silicone ring inside the lid, etc.), which appeals to my ""purity"" preference coming from glass.

My questions for those who made the switch:

Coming from glass, did you notice a ""metallic"" taste with your steel gooseneck?

Does the Saki actually live up to the ""clean taste"" hype compared to the Fellow?

Is the flow control improvement worth the risk of losing that perfectly neutral glass taste?

I want better coffee, but not if it tastes like a penny.

I read some time ago about a man who wasn’t what he pretended to be. Several years ago, at the annual Marine Corps Birthday Ball, a veteran appeared in dress uniform, wearing a chest full of medals. He was impressive looking, for sure.

But when another Marine noticed that one of the man’s medals was upside down, he became suspicious. He snapped a photograph and sent it to the FBI. It turned out this man was an imposter who had been dishonorably discharged from the Navy many years earlier.\[1\]

Isn’t it terrible to pretend to be something you are not? The truth is, at heart we are all potential imposters. We can be quite good at acting like someone we really aren’t. Indeed, we can represent a spiritual life we are not really interested in living after all.

David wrote Psalm 139 to inform us that we are not going to get away with pretending. God knows who we really are, no matter how many medals we pin to our chest. This attribute of God—that He knows everything—is called *omniscience* – all knowing.

David writes about that in verse 1:“O Lord, you have searched me and known me!” This word, “searched,” refers to a diligent investigation. David is *not* suggesting God had to dig around to figure out who David really was. Rather, he’s saying here that God’s knowledge of him is comprehensive—past, present, and future.

Verse 2 expands on this:“You know when I sit down and when I rise up.” In other words, God does not miss one movement—from the moment we get up in the morning to the moment we go back to bed.

David then adds in verse 2,“You discern my thoughts from afar.” So, God not only sees our *movements*; He knows our *motives*.\[2\]

Then the psalmist writes in verse 3: “You search out my path and my lying down.” All day long, the Lord knows every detail of your path—whether you walked or drove to work and when you arrived. God knows when you took your coffee break. In fact, from the first step you took as a toddler to the last step you will take in life, you don’t take one step without God knowing about it.

David writes in verse 5:“You hem me in, behind and before, and lay your hand upon me.” The word translated “hem” is a Hebrew term used to describe a city that is under siege. All the escape routes have been cut off; the inhabitants are hemmed in. David is saying that His powerful God has surrounded him with care and concern.

This truth brings him delight. He writes in verse 6, “Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is too high, I cannot attain it.”

Instead of creating dread that God is watching him, David is joyfully saying here, “God knows everything there is to know about me, and this is wonderful news!” He knows the best about us, and—listen beloved—He also knows the worst about us.

One author wrote this:

There is tremendous relief in knowing that \[God’s\] love for me is \[totally and utterly\] realistic, based on prior knowledge of the worst about me, so that no discovery now can disillusion him about me.\[3\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

David now shifts his attention from the omniscience of God to the *omnipresence* of God—that He is present everywhere at the same time. Note verses 7-8:

*Where shall I go from your Spirit? Or where shall I flee from your presence? If I ascend to heaven, you are there!If I make my bed in Sheol \[the grave\], you are there!*

David is saying that if he goes all the way to the end of the universe, God is there.

Then he adds this:

*If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there your hand shall lead me, and your right hand shall hold me.* (verses 9-10)

To “take the wings of the morning” refers to going infinitely east, toward the dawning of the sun. And to “dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea” probably means to go infinitely west, toward the Mediterranean Sea. David is declaring that whether he goes east or west, God is there waiting for him to arrive.

But what if the lights of the universe go out? Can God see in the dark?

I am reminded of one summer evening when New York City had a power blackout due to a severe thunderstorm. All the lights went out. Tens of thousands of people poured into the streets to break into stores and steal whatever they could. When it was over, more than 2,000 stores had been plundered, and the loss and damages were estimated to be more than a billion dollars.\[4\]

Does God lose control if the lights go out? Well, David answers that God can see in the dark. He is an eyewitness to every crime and every scene. David writes in verse 12\*,\* “Even the darkness is not dark to you; the night is bright as the day, for darkness is as light with you.”

Now David moves on to describe God’s *omnipotence*, or infinite power. He begins in verse 13: “For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother’s womb.”

God’s sovereign design reaches into every mother’s womb at the moment of conception when life begins and a human being begins to develop. David says that God weaves together every fiber of your being; He crafts an original—with unique fingerprints and voice print and retinal shape. You are one of a kind. Every advantage and every ability, every disadvantage and every disability, is sovereignly designed by your Creator.

Whatever your condition might be today, surrender it to the Lord, and ask for His grace and His strength to take one day at a time in dependence upon Him. Such surrender to Him can make the most disabled among us powerful testimonies that God’s grace is sufficient and cause us all to anticipate with even greater joy our future, perfected body and our home in heaven.

Some time ago I read about a young man named Nick. Due to a rare genetic disorder, he was born without arms or legs. Growing up, he struggled emotionally and physically with his condition. But after he became a follower of Christ, he wrote this:

When people read about my life or witness me living it, they are prone to congratulate me for being victorious over my disabilities. I tell them that my victory \[is\] in surrender . . . when I acknowledge that I can’t do this on my own . . . Once I yielded \[to Christ as my Lord and Savior\], the Lord . . . gave my life meaning when no one and nothing else could provide it. \[And\] if God can take someone like me, someone without arms and legs, and use me as his hands and feet, He can use anybody. It’s not about ability. The only thing God wants from us is a willing \[surrendered\] life.\[5\]

That sounds like David, who writes here in verse 14:“I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.” That Hebrew word for “wonderfully” can be translated “uniquely.” David is declaring that he, like all of us, has been uniquely made by God. Let me tell you, this is an amazing statement of faith!

To accept God’s design for you is also a great statement of your faith and trust in Him. Surrender to your Creator and His design and His purposes for your life today, as you trust Him and point people to who He is—your omnipotent, omniscient Creator.

And here’s the good news for all of us who place our faith in Jesus Christ: God’s Word says one day we are going to get new, perfect brains and bodies—no more disability, only glorified ability to serve God and praise Him forever. What a glorious future God has planned for us.

**BLURB:**

God is omniscient—He knows all things. He is omnipresent—He is everywhere present. And He is omnipotent—all-powerful. These great truths are cause, not only for careful self-examination, but also for great comfort and encouragement for every follower of the Lord.

I walked to the coffee stall counter with my son. We ordered a coffee and a hot chocolate, except the teenage girl taking our order didn't speak english.

One of the men, the girl's dad I assumed, walked over to us and handed us our coffees. I said thank you and the man nodded as if he understood. The coffee smelled incredible and I could see two very clean stools and a bench, a few meters away.

I sipped my coffee and said to him we should sit down and wait for the line to shrink. He grabbed the small sack in his hand. He looked up at me and told me he had never liked coffee and that he had reminded me of the fact. I nodded and told him I was sorry.  
We sat on the stools I enjoyed the best coffee I had ever had in my life, while my son stared resentfully at the line. No matter how much I tried to comfort him, the contempt wouldn't leave his face.

I have to have coffee and it is here to stay in my life regardless of my profession.

When I drink a short burst of hot coffee, I feel better, more energetic, and I can focus more.  
However, iced coffee actually makes me **lose** concentration and makes me more jittery. Yes, you read that right! Many people I have met say hot coffee feels more intense or jittery.

What is the difference for me? Does my body process hot and iced coffee differently? (Also, I use the exact same coffee brand/blend for both hot and iced at home, but I have tried different hot and iced and it is the same result every time) 

Sometimes I wonder if the temperature  affects how fast the caffeine hits me. Hot liquids feel like they wake up my whole system, while cold ones almost shock it. Could that explain the focus vs jittery difference?

I also might tend to drink iced coffee **faster** without realizing it, regardless of how fast the body processes it. Maybe drinking it too quickly can cause a sharper caffeine spike and lead to the jitters. I am just thinking out loud.

If anyone else experiences this same hot vs iced difference, I would l've to hear what causes it for you.",1,1765540613.0,NoStupidQuestions,1,0.67,False

However over the last year I have been going to coffee festivals, markets, weeks a lot, and buying some really nice coffees (I like the one's with pronounced fruity notes, berry notes, natural or co-fermented), however when I brew the coffee at home the specific notes that I like are more muted, to almost of a level that I need to concentrate really hard to discern them.

I am using zero water filter with third wave water for my water.

I am usually following the recipe that the roaster recommends when buying the coffee, before defaulting to my regular recipe (20g coffee, 50ml, 30s, +70ml 30s, +90ml 30s, +90ml 30s).


I am thinking that changing the grinder to ZP6, might bring the notes that I really like forward.

I am here to offer up what knowledge I’ve gained with trial and error and what my clinical trial running RN mom taught me to best “advocate” for myself IN TERMS OF APPEARANCE & other tips. It’s hardly a cure all for the problems but how you look is one crucial and hopefully more doable corner of it. A very mild form of gaslighting them back if you will. This is strictly my own opinion and experiences. 



How you dress matters, the check in staff at the desk, the nurse that took your BP, and your doctor make a huge number of decisions about you in the first 10 seconds of looking at you. And they see more than you’d think. 



**I entirely understand if these are not feasible for you, if you can’t meet it it’s fine, look at this list as aspirational and adapt it to your own capacity on the day of your appointment.** I apologize if anything comes off as privileged or inaccessible. It is not my intent to sound privileged, but I own that I was lucky to be raised with it and I am doing what I can to use that privilege to give as much of it as I can to others. 



**Firstly, general tips for all contact with medical staff** 

* Adapt your pain scale to normal healthy people, give them 2 numbers (healthy & chronic pain for you) and/or compare to other types of pain such as more or less then broken bone, cut needing stitches, labor if you’ve had kids, stabbed for a shot etc. see image [https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibromyalgia/comments/yokogs/pain\_scale\_for\_chronic\_illness/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibromyalgia/comments/yokogs/pain_scale_for_chronic_illness/)
* Make a portable version of your medical info, well organized, in a tabbed binder if you can manage it. This will make your life easier in general. Keep it updated with any new lab results, CDs of MRIs/cat, and diagnosis. It is also an important accessory to your credibility, even if you don’t actually end up needing anything in it. 
* Nurses especially, can spot even the smallest stain from 20 ft or more away, inspect all clothing, even if it’s PJs to make sure it’s clean, they are using stains to evaluate your mental health. They will also note anything off in your complexion.
* Doctors do use their sense of smell, especially oncology and hematology, if you can, wash, if you can’t, use deodorant and body spray or perfume, especially on your hair which scent clings to. (If you suspect you have cancer and are seeing an oncologist do the opposite;; don’t wear perfume or body spray to an allergist’s office) 
* Take a moment between parking/ arriving and walking in the door to take a few deep breathes, calm yourself as much as possible and go in grounded. 
* Bring ID, Insurance card, & credit/debit card.



**Organized by trip** 

**Seeing a PCP for the first time**: This. Is. An. Interview. You are establishing a baseline precedent for the value they will assign to your future opinions, self evaluations, suspicions, and questions. 

* Confirm 2 weeks ahead that they have received your medical file transfer, including imaging if relevant, and “kindly request the Dr take a look at it if they have a moment” 
* Get as dressed up as you can possibly manage, business formal or casual (decide based on local culture, wear what an accountant in your city would wear). Seriously, something you would wear to an office job interview. I know its asking a lot of energy but this will likely cut down on effort and possibly number of trips in the future as they will take your word for things over tele health rather then needing to come in every time. 
* Brush and style hair, such as braiding for long hair or hair gel for men if it works with your cut, remove dander from the front as much as possible
* Woman/ those intending to present as female, wear makeup. Don’t go too crazy but put some concealer on those dark circles & acne, eye liner in brown or black or gray, mascara. Avoid bright eyeshadow. 
* Men/ those intending to present male, groom facial hair, be it a fresh shave or well cared for facial hair. 
* If you feel safe enough, take off n95 mask during one on one discussion in private exam room. Facial expressions matter. 
* Bring your medical info, well organized, in a tabbed binder if you can manage it. This will make your life easier in general. Keep it updated with any new lab results, CDs of MRIs/cat, and diagnosis. \*\* for first PCP keep this in a messenger bag or backpack until prompted or specific info is requested. Resist the urge to shove it at them, this will likely go poorly. 
* Bring ID, Insurance card, & credit/debit card.



**Follow up PCP trips once established:** 

* Confirm 1 week ahead that any new relevant labs and imaging have been received
* Dress like you would on the weekend if you were healthy, more “you”, jeans, clean t-shirt, casual summer dress. Inspect for stains and anything damaged. Smell nice as possible (no perfume for allergist offices). 
* Brush hair 
* Makeup optional, men should shave if quite scruffy
* **If going for a new issue, look up one of those “questions to bring up with your doctor”** lists and either print or take notes, bring to appointment. It makes you look more reasonable and gets their thoughts in order / refreshes them on symptoms. Look up ahead what is needed to diagnose for it so you can ask for that lab/test/etc. **The phrase “I know I shouldn’t diagnose myself, but I am concerned about x because y, would you be willing to go over it with me?”** is useful. Yes, it is fawning behavior, but fawning is actually rather effective especially on Dr egos. 
* Bring your medical binder, but to add to it or grab something if it comes up. 
* Bring comfort items (head phones, loops, sunglasses, sweater, water bottle, etc) 
* Bring ID, Insurance card, & credit/debit card.



**Seeing a specialist, getting a specialty scan, or infusion clinic:** 

* As soon as you know your going to see one, start a log of relevant symptoms and severity, this can prevent the wait for a 2nd follow up a month or two later while they wait for data. Also have the reception desk pass a message to the dr requesting that any labs they know they will want be ordered ahead. 
* Confirm 2 weeks out that all relevant medical info has been received, and ask for any intake paperwork to be emailed to you so you can fill it out and send it back in advance.
* Bring your medical binder, prominently and proudly carried in your arms 
* On a first visit dress I’d call it nice-ish casual, not interview level, but meeting up with people you care about for a nice brunch, like a notch or two down from “sunday best”. Jeans are fine, button up casual shirt for guys, decent blouse for women. Follow up visits casual is fine. Unless you are anticipating a specific activity; ex if your doing a cardio evaluation then work out type clothes are a better idea, if its an EKG i recommend women wear an unwired bralette or crop top so you can keep it on under the paper garments without issue, if its an MRI or other scan no mettle anything, if a part of your body will need to be examined then make it as accessible as possible. 
* **If you have ports or other cyborg-esq things that need to be accessed** or are going in for IV treatments, and you anticipate needing to have this type of appointment regularly, consider investing in specialty clothing that allows access to it or having some clothing altered. Most any dry cleaner level seamstress service can take a hoodie or other clothing you provide and add zippers or make flaps with snap closures or buttons where you need them, its unlikely to be break the bank and you can go in with a budget and ask what can be done. This is especially valuable if you anticipate regular infusions of any kind. 
* Come prepared with questions and/ or a list of “questions to bring up with your doctor”, and a timeline list of symptoms especially the first visit. Show them you value their time and they’ll value yours. Try to stay on topic for the specialty rather than a full life story unless they’re asking for it or you think a certain event/ symptom is relevant. 
* Bring ID, Insurance card, & credit/debit card.



**Urgent care:** 

* Before you go, call and ask wait times at multiple places if possible. Confirm who has x-ray, lab, ability to process things like covid tests in house, etc to ensure they have what you need. If possible, find one with hospital admitting/ transfer privileges or one inside a hospital. 
* Avoid weekends and after work hours when possible i.e. times regular doctors are open is best time to go for shortest wait. If it’s a holiday, try and go right at opening or an hour before closing. 
* If you know what it is and what you need, only bring up relevant info, don’t distract them with a life history or you may not get what you need. 
* Get dressed if you can, jeans/yoga pants and t-shirt, if coming from work what you have on is probably fine. PJs discouraged. 
* **Magic words for antibiotics: “I first got sick x day, then I felt way better Y days, then I got sicker again z day”.** Try not to outright lie, but this is the classic pattern for viral infections turning bacterial, it can be subtle if already chronically ill. If your hacking up a lung and they don’t want to give you opiate cough control ask for Benzonatate, or ask for it first then let them decide to give you an opiate one rather then asking for the opiate first. 
* If you are needing **pain control** look as put together as possible, tell them what your current pain is (see general tips) and what you need it to be and why you need it there ex **“I feel A, I need it to be B, because I need to be able to C”**: (make it to work, get to the bathroom on my own etc)”. Try to heard them toward the answer you want with leading questions rather then asking for it directly. 
* Bring ID, Insurance card, & credit/debit card.



**ER trip:** 

* Bring comfort items (head phones, loops, sunglasses, sweater, water bottle, stuffy, eye mask, socks etc) 
* Bring medical binder, including any hand outs for hospitalization with your particular constellation of issues
* Notebook & pen, because who can remember anything while in an ER? 
* Bring ID, Insurance card, & credit/debit card. Also phone charger. 
* Wear: 
   * **For infections**: look abjectly miserable as possible, no makeup, scruffy, pajamas, look like you’ve barely hauled yourself off your death bed. See “magic words for antibiotics” above
   * **For pain control**: I know it’s nearly impossible, but do what you can to appear clean, functional and sane. Take whatever OTC or pain control you have to arrive as clear headed as possible. If you can bear it, change into something more like yoga pants or athletic shorts and a clean shirt to make any scans easier. Looking too close to unhoused raises the risk of being labeled as “drug seeking”. Try and explain what happened as clearly as possible, if you can write it out ahead of going so you can just hand it to anyone who asks, do so. I know the repetitive name, birthday, what happened is absolutely aggravating, but try to be calm and keep breathing through it to answer, they keep asking to see if any answers change or if your coherency drops screening for drug use and OD. **Bring pain scale image for communication** [https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibromyalgia/comments/yokogs/pain\_scale\_for\_chronic\_illness/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibromyalgia/comments/yokogs/pain_scale_for_chronic_illness/)
   * **For cardiac event, severe injury or suspected neurological**: Grab medical binder, wallet, phone, earplugs if siren sound will cause distress & women (if possible) grab an unwired bralette or crop top & **GO NOW**. Have a support person gather the rest of your comfort items and meet back up with you at the hospital. While in transit take off any jewelry, piercings, watches, any metal including wired bra and store securely. Women put on bralette / crop top underneath shirt or sweater to make leads easy to attach without having to flash anyone. Pull out ID & health insurance cards to have in hand on arrival. If you’re not running out the door: Put on pants without metal buttons. Make arms accessible for IV and any ports or other relevant parts of you easily accessed. All this will make rushed EKG, MRI, x-ray, etc faster & as dignified as possible. 



**Other** 

* *therapist/psychologist:* dress as you do most days even if its PJs, be the most authentic version of yourself, they can’t help as well if your trying to be someone else. 
* *psychiatrist:* see first PCP visit for first appointment, fallow ups use your judgment on subsequent visits based on doctor’s resistance to prescribing, some will give more validity to those dressing well while others would rather you dress as you do most days 
* *phlebotomist aka blood draw lab:* save your spoons, they will likely forget you existed as soon as you leave. Ask them to mail you a copy of the results directly as well as to the dr that requested them.
* *scheduled surgery/anesthesia:* generally come with their own prep list, have a list of meds you took in the last 48 hours handy, and any relevant conditions (ex heart issues are important, drug allergies & opioid reactions). Plushies / teddy bears are generally welcome to come with you to surgery no matter your age :) but don’t be shocked if you wake up and your little buddy has a matching bandage.
* *dentist:* generally doesn’t care what you look like. Remove and secure necklaces, ear rings, and lip or other facial piercings if having a pano x-ray. I recommend sunglasses to not be blinded by overhead lights. remember to bring dental appliances every time (ex retainer, night guard, etc), you can request them to be sonically cleaned and make sure they fit right after a filling if a cavity is found. Earplugs can actually make drilling louder, do not recommend. 
* *Physical Tharapy:* water bottle & workout clothes, if you have something you want to or need to use for your PT bring it such as a walker for training to properly use it, stretchy bands to learn how to anchor them in a door, canned food that your using instead of buying expensive weights
* *chiropractic*: athletic wear that allows full range of motion. Dresses can be problematic unless wearing leggings underneath. 
* *gynecologist:* comfy clothes, dresses can work well. Bring a liner or pad for the lube goop to put on when you get dressed again. Bring comfort items as needed. Bring medical binder & “list of questions for your doctor” if having a more in depth discussion about something more than annual poke and prod. 
* *eye doctor:* do what you can to be as cognitively aware as possible ahead of appointment (ex, pain meds on board, cup of coffee, no stressful or too much activity ahead of time), some of the vision tests require you to press a button for each light and being slow cognitively can give bad results. No eye makeup. Wardrobe matters little. Bring binder if you have vision related health issues to discuss, including drug side effects. If you have blood pressure or circulatory issues be sure and keep them informed. 
* *allergist:* casual clothes, no perfume, no drinks other then water, mask encouraged to show care to prevent any infection being passed to asthmatic patients
* *cardiologist:* athletic clothes, especially for any kind of stress test, nothing resticitive on chest area. EKG i recommend women wear an unwired bralette or crop top so you can keep it on under the paper garments without issue.



**I welcome any feedback!** What has worked for you? What would you recommend for other types of trips or specialties? Especially if anyone has been to pain clinics (I have not), what would you wear for the best outcome? Did I miss anything or something need to be more clear? ",4,1765539919.0,ChronicIllness,1,0.83,False

From the moment we draw our first breath, a fundamental need for sustenance and comfort ignites within us, evolving over time into an intricate web of aspirations, cravings, and longings that define our journey. We desire love, success, belonging, wealth, knowledge, peace, and even things as ephemeral as a fleeting moment of joy or the perfect cup of coffee. But what exactly is desire? Is it merely a conscious wish, a simple preference, or something far more profound, rooted in the deepest strata of our psychological makeup? The answer, as we shall explore, leans heavily towards the latter. Desire is not a superficial whim; it is a complex, multi-layered psychological phenomenon, intricately shaped by biological imperatives, cognitive architectures, emotional landscapes, socio-cultural imprints, and even the very neurochemistry of our brains. Understanding these forces is not just an academic exercise; it is a profound journey into self-awareness, enabling us to navigate our own motivations, make more informed choices, and ultimately, sculpt a life aligned with our deepest values rather than being perpetually driven by unseen currents [MFN1].",1,1765539831.0,philosophiii,0,1.0,False

We woke up early that next day, around six in the morning as the rising sun lit the horizon ablaze. We shared a coffee as we packed our gear into Steph’s small, red Hyundai i30. The cool morning breeze further waking us up before dissipating quickly as we finished our bacon and eggs, got dressed and headed down to our local dive shop. On the way over, Mat attempted to call us, leaving a voicemail asking us if we would like to help search for Stephen Preston on the mountains again. He seemed tense, and mentioned he found a number of possible locations he intended to search, including the area we fell into as kids on Mount Osborne. I quickly turned my phone off after he mentioned it, and the rest of the drive to the dive shop was silent.

“Hey girls! We looking for two twelve liter tanks today?” Despite Heather’s dark, gothic appearance, her bubbly demeanor rose our spirits as we signed our liability forms once more. The usually busy dive shop was quiet today, painted baby blue with a vast assortment of dive gear and underwater photography on display. Atop the glass counter showing an array of dive knives and gloves was an old, yellow-paged textbook that Steph was skimming through, *Cryptic Marine Life of Australian Waters* by Wanda Cui, one of our lecturers and head of the research department at the university.

“Yeah- though is there something on today? There isn’t anyone out here-“ I asked, I checked my surroundings just to make sure. Besides Steph, Heather and myself, there was no one else here. In addition, our tanks were the only ones taken out from storage.

“Not sure to be honest, probably just a slow start. I’m sure it’ll pick up later.” She filled our tanks up, the loud screech of air escaping in addition to the mechanical whirling of the large air compressor drowning our thoughts as we picked up our tanks. Though it was hard to hear her, we could faintly make out Heather asking us to stay safe as we left for Cale Point.

Cale Point had quickly became our favourite diving spot, a marine reserve that housed endangered Rockfish, Grey Nurse sharks and Cuttlefish, just to name a few of our personal favourites. Cale Point has multiple bays and sights to see, on the left side there was the abandoned gravel loader, a mountain of metal held up by gargantuan supports that sits long abandoned on the rocky shore. Along the southern headland was The Gutter, the most popular dive spot where there are many distinct underwater landmarks, such as The Nursery where most of the endangered fish reside, Blue Devil Cave where the Blue Devil fish reside, and The Graveyard, where divers lay rocks atop one another, forming a small mound where octopi and cuttlefish protect their young. The road to Cale Point was littered in potholes, since council barely takes care of those old roads, becoming almost untraversable as you reach Rangers Bay. The bay was unique in that it was almost two bays merged into one, forming an hourglass like shape when viewed from above. It was said to be a sanctuary for Grey Nurse sharks and their young, we had dived there a couple times already looking for them, we figured today wouldn't be so different.

We had over thirty dives under our belts, so what could go wrong? Overconfidence is a slow, insidious killer…

When we got to the designated parking lot past the meandering road, we noticed that we were the only ones there. While we noted it as odd, we were distracted by the fact that we could get the best park in the reserve with no hassle. The benefits of diving with a friend far exceeds the burden of hauling over twenty kilograms of equipment between the two each of us. We would go over some of the many hand signals to use underwater, thumbs up for ascent, thumbs down for descent, crossing our arms and rubbing our shoulders for cold water. All of it proving useful for each of our dives. We made our way to the gravel beach, as a foul odour wafted in from the shoreline.

“Guh- That’s- so fucking foul.” I gagged.

“Ugh- Maybe a fisherman left their bait behind.” Steph added, doing her best to not to cough.

We quickly put on our wetsuits, eager to get into the water, followed by our dive boots, before helping zip the other up. We strapped our air cylinders into our buoyance control packs and attached our hoses and tubes, testing our masks while looking at our gauges.

Starting bar: 242.

We would check our gear for damage, as we could not afford an incident like last time. Our rig consisted of the main black and backup yellow regulators, along with a wireless device that sent data to our dive computers. Attached was a pressure gauge and compass that swung loosely from a thin cable and tube. Both of which worked perfectly still. The Buoyancy Control Device, or BCD for short, would articulate to the rig through a thick, dark hose which followed an inflator. The inflator has a button in addition to a mouthpiece, if ever in an emergency where air flow needs to be delivered manually. Everything would connect to a large, heavy air cylinder, small ones sit around ten to twelve kilograms while larger ones can be as heavy as twenty. If you were to dive solo, you would be wise to bring a backup tank. That can weigh around five to eight kilograms, in addition to your main tank. This excludes the lead weights you need to insert in your BCD, your suit or your accessories like torches, knives or cameras.

When I first learned about all the equipment that we had to haul from our beater to the beach. I immediately considered dropping the course, but Steph assured me that it would be worth it. Helping me overcome my fear of the water bit by bit, we trained in the pool first in the quiet hours of the morning. Working our way up to snorkelling in a small bay. To diving in the open ocean. The bay was eerily quiet, and despite the lack of cars in the car park, we both could vaguely make out the silhouette of a person at the outermost bay. We just assumed it was a rock fisher; you see a lot of them around this time of year. We got into the water, slowly, gently swimming out further before putting our fins and giving the all clear to submerge.

The first bay is dominated by brown algae of various species, Neptunes Necklace mostly. Sea Urchins lie in wait of the unwary in the nooks and crevices of rocks. There were few Rock-Cale and Red Morwong that were most commonly seen here, we both saw a large Rockfish which was a good sign, but we wanted to see the Grey Nurse Sharks, so we went further into the second bay.

Current bar: 211.

There is a small plethora of fish and the occasional octopus that resides there. But that day it was mostly desolate. At this point, a steep drop of twenty metres below sea level connects to the adjacent landmarks. The second bay lead to a number of sea-urchin barrens, composed of small boulders with many sea-urchins filling the cracks and crevasses. Grey-Nurse sharks could be seen occasionally out this far, though they preferred a small bay nestled further South. Further than that, an empty abyss of flat, desolate sand and endless ocean. The Grey Nurse sharks here usually reside along a large central boulder at the centre, which Steph and I dubbed The Meteorite. However, we saw no signs of Grey Nurse sharks, though we chalked that up to being so early into the dive. So, we pressed further, our visibility that day being around six to eight metres in-front of you, turbidity at this level means things can just appear out of nowhere, like the first time Steph and I encountered a cute Grey Nurse shark that appeared behind us.

Past the second bay lead to the open ocean, where we have only visited briefly on previous dives. Before today, we had always turned back at that threshold. Today though, Steph was the first one to start swimming out further, which I found odd since she was always the first to turn back. I followed her, at least I tried to, she seemed to be swimming faster than usual. I had guessed she wanted to skip gym later with how fast she was moving herself. It almost gave us no time to look around us.

Current bar: 153 bar.

I saw Port Jackson Sharks below us, they seemed timid, more so than on our other dives. I saw some Leatherjackets as well, though they seemed to stay away from us. Above us, the sun could be seen dimming as we were going deeper, oxygen is used up much faster the deeper you are, and I was eating through mine fast. That was when I started hearing strange noises. Judging our distance from the second bay, I assumed it was the distant, rumbling calls of a whale. Their large, majestically dark presence rarely seen as they approach the bay. Providing a breathtaking, ominous experience, as they are much eerier in person. Deep, guttural vibrations that shake you to your core. Though this sounded different, it was more like - a hum, or a rhythm. It sounded melodic, lasting only a few seconds before the sound of the ocean came back. The silence deafening. There is something eerie about the sounds you hear underwater, the occasional vibrations of the waves above, all of it making you feel like an intruder. Combined with the sense of weightlessness you have, the lack of communication and limited visibility all contributes to the feeling of isolation.

100 bar left.

I felt that we were going very far out to sea, much farther than we have ever gone before. The reefs began to recede, until in front of me was the dim sunlight above me, the ocean floor below me, and the gnawing abyss surrounding me from all sides. In the water, you feel much more vulnerable than on land, you cannot hear as well as those around you, you cannot see as well as them, and they can surround you from above and below. I grabbed my knife from its holster on my thigh and tapped my tank, trying to get Steph's attention. I thought she simply could not hear me, so I tapped louder, I stopped swimming so I could hit my tank as hard as I could to get her attention, only to see her form disappear into the murk. I looked around and I had to guess I was three-hundred meters out at sea. I could feel the immense currents moving around me, pulling me as panic began to set in. I was cursing Steph in my head, what was her plan? Did she want us to get pulled into a rip? I looked around for any kind of landmarks, but there was nothing to help direct me back, nothing except my compass. If I head 210-220^(o) SW from my current location, then I was sure to hit land, hopefully avoiding the strong currents and drift since we were exposed, outside the protection provided by the headlands.

The waters around me became dark, I was completely alone as the abyss had now swallowed me whole. I tapped on my oxygen tank with the hilt of my knife, calling out to her desperately while feeling blindly around my waist for my torch. The memories from the mountain came flooding back. The fear, the dread, the insufferable isolation in the desolate void. I needed a way out. It was then I could hear the hum again, much louder this time. I could even swore I heard it coming from my own throat as I hummed it unconsciously.

Turning on my torch revealed a large congregation of fish. As I illuminated the mass, I began picking up on the strange behaviour they were exhibiting, refusing to disperse from their tall, cylindrical formation. I noticed their numbers would stretch to a trough, seemingly made by the flow of currents caused by the behaviour. I would then notice something at the base of the congregation. Becoming transfixed by something glimmering within the very centre of the aquatic abnormality. It was just far enough that the depth would pose a considerable hinderance. Yet despite this, I felt a strange desire from the glimmer. It brought me comfort in a way, as my fear slipped away, as I swore that I could feel something emanating from it. Now utterly engrossed, I would begin my slow descent, careful not to exceed comfortable equalisation depth. The object in question sat just slightly beyond my usual depth limit. I could feel the pressure mounting as I attempted to retrieve the item that had suddenly seized my curiosity.

50 bar left.

The speed of the mass accelerated towards the base of the cylindrical formation. Towards the bottom, a ring of starfish could be seen at the very bottom. Their appendages joined together in unison, along with a number of sea slugs and urchins to form a sort of barrier on the sea floor. Further out I could just make out the distant shapes of grey-nurse sharks and larger parrot fish circling the central formation. Just then, a loud, violent ping shot through my ears as they started ringing. The water around me pulsed and vibrated as sharp pains began to arise within my nose. Despite equalizing continually, I had managed to rupture something in my nasal cavity, as my head pounded madly as if my brain was going to outgrow my skull. The rich metallic smell combined with the blood staining the inside of my goggles was unable to dissuade me as I excavated the object. First with my dive knife, before hastily digging with my bare hands. I had little time to properly observe the thing, as the danger grew exponentially with every second spent digging, under the layers of murk and sediment. My head was throbbing, though it discouraged me little. During my brief and rapid dredging, I would notice that the mass of fish would disperse, quickly fleeing into the dark. The pain and dread that once lingered pensively now dissipating as I ascended to safer depths. The dim rays of sunlight starting to return as waves could be seen underneath the water. The thing shone of an extravagance unlike anything rendered from hand; its smooth finish, sharpened edges and bizarre engravings intrigued me immensely.

40 bar left.

As I carried the thing with me, I saw nothing around me, no fish, not the seafloor. Nothing. I was alone amidst the infinite ocean, surrounded by all sides. I floated listlessly, my head throbbing, the pressure mounting. I followed my compass and started heading to where I estimated the entrance to the bay was. I kicked with all the strength that my legs could muster. I could vaguely see the reefs beginning to come into view, I was getting closer. But I heard it again, the melody. It was like a choir, who's voices were drowned in decades of sodden sorrows. It rang in my ears, I could feel them following me, I kicked faster.

30 bar left.

My mind began to falter; time seemed to pass by faster as I slowed. My legs were giving out on me, but I persisted though. I felt vulnerable and exposed; I barely see the rocky seafloor below me as I approached what looked like the second bay. I kicked harder now, the end so clearly in view.

20 bar left.

The hum was still audible, I could feel it ringing in my ears. If I had to rise now, the current would pull me back out. I had to keep going, there was no other way.

10 bar left.

I was so close, I could taste blood in my mouth. I could see crimson. That hum, it was coming from the thing, I could feel it. It vibrated in my hand, a resonance hard to describe or decipher.

0 bar left.

“Claire! You’re bleeding! Are you okay? I’m so sorry, It got so dark, and I was signalling for ages. I just assumed you’d swim up if-“ I hugged her with my free hand, my forehead resting softly against hers as the waves bobbed us up and down. We both calmed down as we approached the entrance of the first bay, climbing out and laying down on the gravel beach as I presented the thing I had recovered.

“Steph, I- I watched you swim out passed the second bay. Why…?” I coughed.

“Pass the second bay? No- no I was still in the second bay, looking for sharks. Maybe there was another diver?” She replied.

Had there been another diver? Unless they were swimming from near the loader, there was no one at the bay when we started, I checked afterwards and we were still the only ones there that day. That awful stench was still present as we unclipped gear.

“I found- I found this down there...” I said weakly, I felt winded and my joints started aching as the pain slowly returned. Steph looked at it curiously, before putting it on the ground to tend to my injuries. Her voice a low whisper as my head throbbed from the pressure. My vision became blurry as an intense ringing begun in my ears. 

“Claire! Are you okay? Here, lay your head to the side, alright?”

“Steph- I’m fine, really-“

Despite my clear disapproval, I agreed, laying my head down as she took off my dive gear and cleaned my nose. The blood would continue gushing from my nose. I would cough lightly, lightly spraying the object and ground.

“Rest now, you’ve pushed yourself too far.” She said softly. Her words came to me muddled and deafened, as I would stretch my arm out to reach for the thing from the sea. It had a magnificent lustre, and was peculiarly round. It was a dark, gem like disc, with lustrous reflective threads of metal stretching around its surface. I held it up to her in my blood-soaked hand.

“What do you think it is..?” I asked faintly. She looked it, spinning it around and observing the light reflecting off its surface. She cleaned it in a shallow rock pool to cleanse it, only to see her freeze and stare obliquely into the water.

\-

I could not help but think back to our first swim together here. We saw little during our snorkelling trip, but I felt more comfortable being in the water. Steph held my hand throughout the entire experience, comforting me at every moment. I remember how sore I was after our first proper dive, but how amazed I was with the variety of sea life that dwelled down there. We came across a diverse array of life, from Cuttlefish to Grey Nurse sharks; jellyfish to a variety of coral.

“Steph, I don’t think I can do this…”

She hugged me tightly and held me by my shoulders, looking at me with strong conviction and confidence.

“You *can* do this, I know you can.”

“But… What if I freak out again, or- or drown or…”

She rested her warm palm on my cheek, before placing two of her soft fingers on my lips. All of my worries washing away as warmth enveloped me.

“Shh... it’ll be okay Claire, I promise…”  

She pulled me close, and there I knew that she felt the same for me, as I had for her. There was always a spark between her and I. But for the longest time, I had just chalked it up to a fantasy, that my feelings would be unreciprocated. If only I knew that she had felt the same way for all of these years, I would have saved myself a lot of trouble. Looking back on it, all of the signs were there.

\-

Steph was quiet for an uncomfortably long time. The pain starting to subside as I managed to get up and take off the remainder of my gear. We both looked at each-other, knowing exactly what the other was about to say.

“We’re taking this to the University, and Claire-“ She stopped, handing me the thing.

“I want you to turn it in, to be remembered. You’re the one who found it.”

I looked down at it, holding it with both hands. Was this really it? The breakthrough we’ve both been looking for? It felt like a distant dream, but the pain was still there. It was real. How much I wish now that it was just fantasy.  

“Steph, I can’t just, take all the credit for this, you were here with me!”

“I know! I know. But don’t you think you deserve this? I’m already content with what I have, I got you, my family. I’m at Uni, which was a huge part of my bucket list. But you wanted this.”

I started to tear up, I do not know whether because of what I was hearing, or the small dose of adrenaline starting to wear off. I had always felt it was the former though. I hugged her, like I never have before. Crying softly on her shoulder.

“Steph… thank you…”

She patted my back as she picked us up off the rocky platform, the tide starting to rise and swell once more. From the corner of my eye, I see the figure from earlier standing by the shores edge. Though it could have been my eyes playing tricks on me, I swore they carried yellow fins with them…

Steph took me to the doctors despite my disapproval. They concluded that while I am fine to go about normal, day to day activity, but pressure related activities, such as scuba and free diving, were off limits until I healed fully. Though I was relieved that I did not require medical attention like when I was younger, I was struck by guilt knowing that Steph and I could not go diving together anymore. Though, I would be lying if I said I was not relieved to be away from the water for a little while. That being said, for the following week, I dreamt of being stuck underwater. I could not see the seafloor or the surface, but a saw a figure floating in front of me. It was just on the edge of the murk, its yellow fins showing that it was vertical, its legs and arms pointed down. I could faintly tell that it was facing me. I heard it again, stronger this time, a murderous melody, a siren's call. The thing floated closer to me, as chills ran down my spine. I could make out more details, the wetsuit was ripped, the gear old, worn and growing algae. Dark liquid leaked from open holes, something bulged and squirmed underneath in a parasitic manner. The thing that haunts me still about it was the head. There was nothing within, just endless blackness, reflecting dark seas of infinity.

“Claire! You okay?”

I awoke in a cold sweat in our bed, my body shaking as I looked over at Steph. She was holding me tightly under the covers and I almost shoved her away with how close her eyes were to mine.

“MM don’t do that! You’re *right* in my face.”

She scooted back a bit and covered her mouth with some of our blanket.

“I’m sorry, you woke me up with all of your tossing and turning…”

“I did? Fuck, I’m- I’m sorry Steph. I really- I didn’t mean to wake you...”

“It seemed like a bad nightmare…”

“It was…”

We both looked up at the ceiling, I felt unable to go asleep after that. I wanted company so I would feel less alone. I figured Steph would want to go back to sleep soon anyway, but then she asked me-

“What was it about..?”

I told a white lie, but one that conveyed the weight of the dream. On the bedside table closest to me, I saw the thing we pulled up from the sea earlier that day. I saw her shudder and hold onto my arm subconsciously at the very mention. We agreed never to mention it again that night, but that dream. It felt so real. Like I was back there once more.

1pkpojq,https://www.reddit.com/r/shiftingrealities/comments/1pkpojq/expectations_of_whats_possible_with_shifting/,Expectations of what's possible with shifting,"Crossposting this. I think I shifted last night. I did my meditation, felt my awarnes pulsate for a few seconds, and I was hit with this knowing that ""oh SOMETHING shifted"". Woke up in my CR today. Went out to get my morning coffee, as per usual, and the coffee shop I'm a regular at has a new chair. I DIED laughing, because it was placed at the table I usually sit at, and people often end up asking for an extra chair. It's a really nice shade of blue, by the way. Anyways, I found it hilarious that THAT'S what shifted in my reality.

Naturally,that got me thinking about my own expectations and how they might be limiting. I am definitely a ""step by step"" kind of person, while I do believe shifting is real, I do doubt my own ability to do it, if that makes any sense. I definitely have this limiting belief that I need to take this entire journey one step at the time, that I need small successes to come first in order for me to be convinced I can do this.

All that to say, that's my personal experiance, and that's the way I stand in my own way - by needing proof that I am capable of getting what I want. Not really sure what to do with that realisation, or how to approach it, but I do hope someone can give me advice, and I would hope me posting about this might find someone else who needs to hear it as well. 

Anyways, very grateful for that blue chair. That's my second ""proof"" of shifting in a very short amount of time. Well, chair is DEFINITELY not what I expected, but I am happy to take it.

It’s funny and infuriating at the same time.

I'm very much a beginner when it comes to espresso making, but I do love myself a good cup of coffee. My last trip to Japan really cemented the idea of opening up a small shop of my own in the next few years, so I was looking at different machines to get started out with so I can start practicing. 

So far I've picked out: 

\- Gaggia RI9380/46 E24 Espresso Machine as the starter since it looks like the tinkering process would be fun to mess around with

\- LAGOM P80 grinder - seems like a solid prosumer buy(?)

  
Would this be a good place to get started? Should I go after something different for a better experience? I'm not tied to a budget per say - I can spend more if its really worth it, or I can downsize if spending the $2-3k is a little excessive when I'd get better practice working with other machines for less.

Context: My life has been pretty dark. Grew up in a dysfunctional family with an alcoholic and drug addict dad who would regularly beat my mom up, threatened to kill us, and then squandering his entire savings on vices. As young as 3 years old I saw my dad choking the hell out of my mom and throwing hot coffee on her. This went on for 8 years. At the same time, my parents' went bankrupt. My mom would take me and my sister on hotels whenever my dad would go crazy. Eventually we left him and separated. But the past hurts meant my sis was pretty unstable, and conflict never left the home. She eventually grew to be rebellious and then got married abroad leaving my mom feeling betrayed and full of resentment. I was then sexually abused by another kid.

My mom, had to work for my grandparents at their hardware store (Chinese kami kasi), while also becoming the caregivers of my relatives, so she'd be very busy. Oft times she'd rant to me. 

Incoming third year na sana ako ngayon kaso I did not enroll this year, because again I was hit with a bad episode of depression, not being able to sleep early at night, just staring at the stars crying and wishing I was never born.  My depressive episodes have been going on for 4 years now, lasting from days to weeks, up to a month, with my daily living impacted so much as i don't have the energy to just do anything or face people. I've been seeing a psychiatrist, occupational therapist, and psychotherapist regularly and I was diagnosed with PTSD. I will be taking escitalopram SSRI's for 6 months.... I want to deal and fix myself at this time. 

Now second semesters enrolling period is about to end and I want to transfer to a state university for free tuition, but I couldn't because one of my minor subjects has no grade because my teacher suddenly resigned to deal with her son having cancer. Now I'm waiting for the school admin to fix my grades..... which would be done after the enrolling period... I would have to spend another 6 months unschooled. 

Another reason for stoppiing is that I do not know what course to take. Maybe it's a factor of my experiences, but whenever I try to plan my life, I overthink, get paralyzed, and have this sense of dread overcoming me. Initially I took up accountancy because my mom pushed me because she wants me to takeover the family hardware store because there are no successors. I had a mixed feeling about this idea because I'm not even business-inclined. And it's the typical traditional Chinese business with them working till Saturday. My uncle who manages it would stay up past midnight everyday because everything is done manually and has no life outside the hardware. However, inheriting it would mean I don't have to start from scratch, have the advantage of our connections. Well, I found out the hard way that accountancy was brutal, and I did not make the cutoff grade because of one subject. out of 270+ students in our batch, only 20 nalang natira ngayong third year. The only thing motivating me was so that I could pass. But had no interest in it. I regret not thinking deeply of what I wanted to do back then.

I'm just lost right now, I'm so sorry my post is not orderly. I'm typing this in a Starbucks, afraid of going home because I had just failed myself, my mom, etc. I'm so ashamed. (The uni I want to transfer to said they won't accept a transferee with a missing grade and the deadline is next monday na.... And here I am still waiting for my grades.)I feel I am going behind in life. I was consistently in the top 3 in highschool, now I'm at rock bottom. I don't know how I even got this far considering I have extreme anxiety, lack of planning and decision-making skills, procrastination, this stupid PTSD. Now I am here, 21 already...

Please bare with me since english isn't my first language. 
I've been on the pills since I was 15 (35 now). About three years ago I changed my pills that made me sick for about a year before I realised it was them. 
I gained about 10 kg, even though I ate as usual and worked out. Started to get more tired and had high blood pressure. 

I started my ADD-medc (started with concerta, changed to medikinet and now on Elvanse) around that time too and could feel it helped with the focus but not the tiredness.
 
My contact nurse at the ADHD-clinic said that the medicine was working but that I was probably depressed even tho I told her I was not feeling depressed. She made me do CBT. When I was done with it I told her that the psycologist even said I wasn't depressed. She then pursued I was burnt out even tho I told her I'm not stressed. She made me go to the burn-out clinic. And even they agreed with me that I wasn't depressed or burnt out.

But then I realised it was probably the birthcontrol that made me sick. So I stopped using them and wanted to ""know my body"" since I've been on the pills for so long.

I was losing the weight and started to feel myself again. I was ok with getting pimples again since I knew it would just be the phase for the body to adapt. I stopped drinking alcohol around this time and later even coffee since it doesn't work on me and made me more nauseas.

I tracked my period and started to up and lower my ADD-medc depending where I was in my cycle.

But then I started losing my hair and started to feel like shit during luteal. The fucking pain when I had my ovulation.. and then the sickness started. The feeling of being nauseas and the feeling of I am going to faint everyday until my period. My hands were shaking and I got pale. I had to eat more often to ease the nauseasness.

I found this thread and found about Famotadine <3

I said to myself, fuck this shit, I don't want to know my body at all and started using my old pills again (YAZ). The skin and hair was getting better, but still after 3 months without a break with the pills I was feeling shit during ""luteal"". I'm on 6th month now with the pills.

I went to a private doctor and asked her if I have diabetes 🤪 she said I would feel more shit if I had it. But how more shit could one actually feel!? She did all the bloodwork and said it all looked perfect. She prescribed me some medicine for the stomach even if I said I tried everything and it's just famotadine that works. I had to take them before she could refer me to a gynecologist. 
I didn't want to take more medicine.

I asked a chinese medicine lady about my problems and asked if she think she could help me. And she said yes, that it sounds like my livermeridian was blocked and that's why my birthcontrol isn't working properly.

So I googled what herbs could help my livermeridian.
I bought all the herbs that could help and some tea with the herbs in it.

Let me say.. if you're gonna try this cleanse, I recommend you get up an hour earlier cause you'll have to run to the bathroom a few times in a row. I thought I was gonna get so skinny because of this. But nope.. hehe

I asked chatgpt how I would do this cleanse. 
It said to drink everyday for three weeks. To take it before bedtime since the liver works at the most at night.
The first week will be rough with running to the bathroom all the time, but that was normal since it's the toxins in the body  leaving. It said I could get rashes and breakouts and get more tired (!! Ughh). But it didn't for me.
On the second and third week i only had to run to the bathroom once in the morning.
The tea made me sleep better aswell..
Anywho..

When my luteal phase started I was feeling anxious. I had my famotadine prepared in my bag. 
But nope.. not nauseas at all! I'm getting my period on sunday and still haven't used any famotadine at all. I am so happy!

I'm still tired as fuck and still have to up my dose. But i can defenitly live with that. And I probably need to meditate more because of my angry-mood. 

It's just my first luteal since the cleanse, but I'm so excited and wanted to share with you and hope it can help some of you if you want to try it.

As others have said, it feels like a slightly different type of concentration, less urgent.

1pkp3g4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pkp3g4,Kokuyo FitCurve,"Started out well, but...

* **MODEL:**

Kokuyo FitCurve – model **PS-300B**  
0.5 mm *(available only in 0.5 mm)*    

* **MATERIALS:**

Other than the silicone rubber grip and metal cone tip, the FitCurve is all plastic, including the pocket clip. Inside, hydrocarbon chains reign supreme – only the spring (stainless-steel) and the collet of the clutch are metal.

* **ERASER:**

You can say it has a BIG chunk of an eraser – 35 × 7 mm rod of *blue* latex rubber. First time I see a blue eraser, and it works very well. To use it, you have to screw the eraser out, just like a [TK-Fine](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalpencils/comments/1l40763/fabercastell_tkfine_vario/) from Faber-Castell.

* **MEASUREMENTS:**

The FitCurve has 147 mm from tip to top, with the center of mass located at 69 mm from the (extended) tip. As the name implies, it has a curvy body – fatter on the extremities and slimmer in the middle. Right below the pocket clip it is 11.8 mm wide, and that tappers to 10.8 mm right above the grip. It flares up to 12 mm at the grip’s widest part, tapering down again to 10.4 mm immediately above the cone tip. Putting it on my coffee scale, I got 18.87 g - quite heavy for a plastic mechpen.

* **FEATURES:**

Kokuyo’s marketing appeal for the FitCurve is centered on the pencil’s curvy form, that supposedly makes it more comfortable to use. And of course, it’s a budget model. However, to my surprise, only after I got it that I discovered that you can retract the tip! Just knock the top and press the lead sleeve against the body and it becomes 100% pocket-friendly.

* **AESTHETICS:**

Not bad! Though I’m not partial to that milky-white look of the grip, overall, it looks nice. *In theory* you can have the FitCurve in blue, black, pink, white, green, purple and light green and light blue. I wrote *in theory* because I only found photos of the blue (mine), pink and light blue. So, is it out of production 🤔?

* **ERGONOMICS:**

All in all, the FitCurve feels great in my hand. The grip is very comfortable and has a great size, and the pencil also has a nice weight. The only issue is the clutch: first knock, from zero, advances 0.5 mm of lead. But the second knock, when you already have some lead sticking out, pushes out another 1 mm of lead. So, unless you use the lead to the point that the tip is scrapping the paper, the second knock will deliver too much lead.

* **MY THOUGHTS:**

In terms of ergonomics, the FitCurve gets very close to me calling it GREAT, with its fantastic grip, and nice weight. Moreover, it also has an awesome eraser. Honestly, I didn’t expect a budget model to feel so good. However, when you actually use it, two flaws show up. First and foremost is the bad clutch. Does it behave like that because the chucks are plastic? Whatever the reason, it’s a far cry from the precise clutch that you see on a Sharp P205, for instance. And secondly, the clutch is located 17 mm from the tip. What that means is that, with a 60 mm lead rod, you will have to throw out 1/3 of it, because the clutch won’t hold anything less than 20 mm long.

Well, I know it is a budget model, and right after I got it, my hopes soared… Until I actually used it 😖. Therefore, I would say that the FitCurve is only *kind of nice*.",8,1765537102.0,mechanicalpencils,1,0.91,False

to rearrange your thoughts

to let you believe it was your idea.

behaving god knows why optimistic.

I was wondering what the embark program is really like, they told us we would have one week in each field (feels kinda short), but what should I expect? Also what can I really do to stand out? I’ve been told to reach out to people and try set up coffee chats but I can’t imagine who would wanna take an hour out of there day to eat lunch with an 18 year old (probably overthinking it). 

Also after going to talent sync in lakehouse, I meant so many people in advisory it got me wondering what’s so special about it? A lot of people told me they transferred from audit into it. Is it because of the exit opps, workload, etc. 

I know these might be some silly questions, but I’m curious and wanted some honest opinions. Cheers! ",1,1765535915.0,KPMG,0,1.0,False
1pkos33,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1pkos33/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1pkormd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1pkormd/aitj_for_refusing_to_do_family_secret_santa/,AITJ for refusing to do family Secret Santa because my sister turned it into a “brand wishlist” thing?,"My family does a big get-together every year (usually 12 to 16 people, depending on who brings a partner). For the last 6-ish years we’ve done Secret Santa because otherwise it gets expensive and chaotic. The “rules” were always simple: pick a name, spend around $40-50, bring one wrapped gift, done. It was actually kinda fun because people would do thoughtful stuff like a cookbook with sticky notes, a cozy blanket, a weird local coffee sampler, that sort of thing.



This year my older sister “Kate” (32F) volunteered to run it and immediately made it… a lot. She made a Google Sheet with everyone’s names and then a separate tab where everyone has to put a wishlist with links. She set a hard cap of $60 (fine), but then she started messaging people like “make sure your list is realistic” and “please include at least 8 options.” When I opened the sheet, most people had stuff like skincare sets, AirPods cases, branded hoodies, specific candles, etc. Kate’s list was basically Sephora and Lululemon. My mom texted me like “just fill out the sheet so Kate stops stressing.” So I did, and I put normal things: a basic electric kettle, a nice chef’s knife, a bookstore gift card, a warm beanie. Kate replied in the group chat with “can you add some actual items not just gift cards” and then DM’d me that the kettle I linked was “kinda boring” and I should add “something fun.”



Then she sent another message to everyone saying gifts must be from the wishlist, no “random stuff,” and to “avoid generic gifts.” She also said we have to include a gift receipt and “please don’t do bargain versions” because it’s “not fair.” That last part hit a nerve because I know what she means by bargain. I’m not broke, but I’m also not out here buying brand name things just because they have a logo. Also, the whole point of Secret Santa (to me) was thoughtfulness, not shopping off a spreadsheet like we’re doing office HR gifts.



So I said in the group chat, pretty politely, “Hey I’m going to sit out this year. I’d rather just bring appetizers and hang out, the wishlist rules stress me out.” Kate immediately called me selfish and said I’m “ruining the tradition.” My mom called me and did the whole sigh thing and said I’m making things difficult and that people already drew names. I offered to just buy a $60 gift card for whoever has my name and be done with it, but Kate said that’s “against the rules.” My dad said I’m being stubborn and it’s “not about money.” But it literally is about money and control, at least partly. Also I don’t love being told that my gift ideas are boring.



Now my sister is telling everyone I’m trying to cheap out and “protest Christmas,” which is not even true. I already bought cookies ingredients for the party and I was planning to bring a nice bottle of something for my parents (not for the exchange, just for them). I just don’t want to participate in a gift exchange that feels like shopping for approval. My aunt texted me “just do it for family peace,” and my younger cousin joked that I’m the Grinch. I’m honestly considering just not going at all, because it’s turning into A Thing and I hate being the center of it.



AITJ for refusing to do Secret Santa unless we go back to the old casual rules?



TL;DR: Sister made Secret Santa strict (wishlist only, no gift cards, no “bargains”), I opted out, family says I’m ruining it.

(Yes I’ve been to all of these states)

WORST 8-ACT pointless state with bugger all going on and even worse no beaches plus… Parliament House…

7-Victoria I very much dislike Victoria especially Melbourne (yes I live in NSW, why?) but seriously: cold, and way too unaffordable for most Australians, politics don’t give a crap about farmers. One the positive side - has great coffee, food and access to events and education.

6-Northern Territory not much going on, scorching hot and the most dangerous state in Australia. Has beautiful scenery though and a great relaxed lifestyle (outside of Alice Springs)

5-Tasmania beautiful state with amazing scenery and beaches and a lot of… isolation..?

4-NSW has grown a lot on me since moving here. Sydney is way too overcrowded and a proper sh*thole especially in the last 2 decades or so. Inland NSW is beautiful though and has a great sense of community and culture.

3-QLD the state I was born in. An incredible state with amazing sports culture and drinking. Pair that with beaches and a tropical climate and you have one of the best states in Australia. Brisbane feels more like a big town, and often promoting a very relaxed and healthy lifestyle.

2-South Australia what a beautiful state. I have travelled all of South Australia’s coastline and a lot of the inland area areas. Beautiful beaches with incredible people and a relaxed lifestyle that comes with the semi isolation from the Eastern States. Great sports and vibe.

BEST 1-Western Australia Living in this state for 13.5 years (outside of Perth) was incredible. Even though it’s the most isolated state in Australia, you don’t feel like you need to leave as artists still come here, the education system is incredible and has major sports teams from multiple leagues. The state has beautiful scenery and landscapes. From desert to the south western wine region. Perth doesn’t feel crowded. Sunsets on the beach. All this creates a super chill lifestyle that promotes getting outside, love it.

im someone who LOOOVES playing (literally all sports, chess, fps games, etc.) and reacting in the moment and im also obsessed with visuals, aesthetics, music, all the typical Se stuff. i could move for hours and never get tired if im having fun, and i would much rather do that than sit down and talk, however interesting the topic may be

but at the same time when im alone i find myself in my head, thinking, dreaming, replaying the past to deduce things from it and imagining the future, finding deeper meaning and symbolism in the mundane - which is an Ni realm.

BUT then also when in discussions i tend to offer different perspectives and explanations for things (e.g. when my friends jump to conclusions or fail to see behind the scenes of situations) so if someone says ""this person spilled their coffee so they must be clumsy"" im gonna be like ""no, what if theyre sleep-deprived, what if they're multi-tasking, what if something else fell and caused the coffee to spill?"" just an example, that causes people to label me as argumentative --- which you can argue is Ti but it could very well be Ne

HOWEVER im also frequently nostalgic and attach sentiment to memories (even though my memory is garbage) and i like to organise sensory information (like sticking to a certain monochromatic aesthetic or a procedure for doing things) which is Si at play
