I am regretting life decisions right now. I have been on maintenance for about 4 months and over the last month I have been able to eat whatever I want and not feel sick. Well today I was stupid and had coffee and half a donut. Then a few hours later I had spicy food. For the last 4 hours I have had such bad nausea, I can't even stand up straight. My stomach is killing me! I took antacids and that helped a tiny bit. Now I have given in and just took a zofran to see if that will help.  I wanted to ride out the nausea as long as I could without zofran just in case my poor stomach needed to empty.  Take it from me, don't eat like crap! Thanks to the delayed emptying I don't know when this misery will end.   ",1,1735452548.0,Zepbound,3,0.99,False
1hopq7j,https://i.redd.it/6rtasyz3bq9e1.jpeg,"[DAV Spoilers] Finished Veilguard, got the platinum, and my overall thoughts. The most disappointed I‚Äôve ever been with a game","Lots to talk about with this one. I had a lot of issues with the narrative in this game, both with story and characters. 

First issue is when the story starts. I feel like we start about 1/3 into the actual story where disrupt Solas‚Äôs ritual, just feels we‚Äôre rushing into it and it would‚Äôve been better in my eyes if we had start with more of a build up

I really don‚Äôt like how much of lore uncovered in this game just boils down to ‚ÄúThe Elves did it‚Äù just makes the world less interesting for me .
Some lore inconsistencies that bother me. We hear so much about Tevinter being the place where magic rules and slave runs high, yet we don‚Äôt get a clear indication of either of those. At the end of the Trespasser DLC, a cut of Elves flock away to join Solas, yet there‚Äôs nothing of them in this game

I also had much issues with the villains, they‚Äôre kinda just a slightly better version of Corypheus(he really sucks as a character). They‚Äôre just not very compelling, interesting, or threatening really. I would‚Äôve preferred if we just had Solas as the main villain.

The cast of companions were rough this time around. 

Neve is now the worst companion in the franchise in my eyes, she‚Äôs Mass Effect Jacob Taylor levels of boring and I don‚Äôt what the hell was going on with her voice actress, but she sounded like a fucking robot the whole game.

Taash is not very good. I feel like I would‚Äôve liked them better if BioWare didn‚Äôt botch and fuck around with the message of their personal quest and gave them a better personality than that of a 16 year old moody teenager.

Lucanis is very one note. His only noteworthy traits is his love for coffee and how Spite is an inconvenience every once in a while. Plus the e whole Spite storyline was just so underwhelming.

Harding was alright, she‚Äôs kinda the representative of just OK.

Davin is pretty good, I enjoyed him Assan. And his storyline of deciding the fate of the Griffons was solid

Bellara is pretty good as well. She was sort of another version of Merrill but amped up to 11, gets a little annoying at times but I can deal with that

Emmrich is the one true star of Veilguard, loved him and Manfred is my fucking boy. He was the only storyline I was fully invested in.

With other characters, Varric I saw the twist from about 20 miles away. Solas was another diamond in the rough for this game, characters returning from past games don‚Äôt really have any emotional impact for me, it‚Äôs just kinda ‚ÄúOh, they‚Äôre here.‚Äù

And then there‚Äôs Rook, such a nothing character. It‚Äôs possible to have a protagonist in an RPG with a set up backstory, but BioWare botched it here. Rook is not even really a character, they just move the plot forward. And it doesn‚Äôt help with the dialogue wheel where every option in dialogue says pretty much the same thing in a slightly different tone(They Fallout 4‚Äôd it). Seriously BioWare needs to ditch the dialogue wheel.

Overall the game was underwhelming, disappointing, and just not very good. 3/10",0,1735452439.0,DragonAgeVeilguard,1,0.4,False

I'm open to all locations, relationship statuses, employment statuses, native languages, ages, ethnicities, religions, etc. As long as we can hold a good conversation and vibe well, that's all that matters. A big plus would be if we share the total despise for ghosting too üëª

Hey everyone.

So I‚Äôm a bearded and tattooed guy that is also a dad. I‚Äôm married and living a life most would be envious of.

But I‚Äôm also lonely and mostly tired.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes I travel, most times I find. But my life is basically just meetings about meetings and it‚Äôs exhausting. I play some music while working. I play guitar and piano, neither one very good but I think they‚Äôre decent at least. I read a lot which makes me write a lot. I write mostly poetry and short stories. Nothing longer has lived up to my expectations. 

I‚Äôm a coffee snob that loves concerts. If you like a band I let have already seen them live. I love it. I love to cook, and I really enjoy nerdy things like making spreadsheets for everything. Both arms are covered in ink and I plan to get many more.

You? Just be cool. I don‚Äôt have stipulations other than you at least try to have convo. I want to be seen and heard and I want someone I lol forward to talking to.

1hopnpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hopnpo/curious_on_thoughts_from_the_ladies_on_my/,Curious on thoughts from the ladies on my thoughts on how long to wait for initiating some super light form of physical touch and all that which comes after/ later,"Ex: just small/ simple hand touching, or light playful shoulder slap if like a arcade machine she gets the prize and i didn't get one when I tried

I'm of the opinion (as an introverted leaning person with a degree or two of shyness) that I wouldn't want to do any form of super light touching at all on a ""pre date"" (over coffee) and not on a ""first real date"" either. Maybe 3rd date if positive vibes. 

I have yet to get that far but just my mind at this time is so tired and it's been a nagging thing in my mind these past days.

Suppose for example more sensual flirting is going on and it's getting blush territory but not actually all that physical (e.g. innuendos, ideas stated, playful word use). Wouldn't this be best after being clear RE: being exclusive and not seeing anybody else?

And that which comes after: getting into each others pants. In my head I never put it much thought but this winter season has made me realize I think I should pay some mind to it...how much time before sex is subjective isn't it? Like some say 6 dates, some say 3 dates, others I think believe it should be saved until you're both saying ""i'm your bf/gf"". 

But at the least after 6 dates say over the course of 1.5-2 months be too soon? I feel like I'd be ""just another guy"" who's after her body.  From what I recall talking with an older lady some 6yrs ago, according to her some guys are only able to really get off and/or enjoy sex with a woman when they're more invested mentally and emotionally. And I think there's something there, and that it makes sense to me. Because I enjoy deep bonds more than cheap things with fake people. So in the end, investing in the relationship feels like the better way of thinking about when to start handsy before even reaching below the belt.

1hoplq4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hoplq4,"Advice on dressing for my new unique proportions? Brands, layers, cuts, tailoring? During my wife‚Äôs pregnancy, I (M31) gained 130lbs in 9+ months, all in my belly‚Äînow stuck with a 67‚Äù gut, looking overdue with quadruplets. Doctors say it‚Äôs the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome they‚Äôve ever seen. ","Over the past 9+ months, I‚Äôve experienced a truly surreal transformation due to an extreme case of Couvade Syndrome, or ‚Äúsympathetic pregnancy.‚Äù I (M31) have gained 130 pounds‚Äîall in my belly‚Äîduring my wife‚Äôs pregnancy, leaving me with a 67-inch waistline and a silhouette that looks more overdue with quadruplets than any standard body type. While I‚Äôve come to terms with the medical side of this condition, one of the most frustrating aspects of my transformation has been figuring out how to dress myself with any sense of style, comfort, or dignity.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/a/1XUx2qQ) are some photos and videos of me before versus me now in the last couple months of this transformation. 

My body has outgrown nearly every piece of clothing I own, and I‚Äôm at a loss for what to wear. Button-up shirts pull so tight that they gape open, and even the largest sizes I‚Äôve tried seem to ride up over my belly whenever I move. Pants are just as difficult‚Äîthey constantly dig into the underside of my belly or refuse to stay up without a belt, which only emphasizes how far my stomach pushes out. Most of the time, I feel like I‚Äôm one wardrobe malfunction away from total embarrassment, and it‚Äôs only added to the already overwhelming stares and comments I get in public.

I‚Äôm hoping this community can offer some guidance on how to dress for my unique proportions. Are there certain brands or cuts that might better accommodate a large, round belly? Should I prioritize oversized fits, stretchy materials, or specific types of tailoring? I‚Äôd also love tips on colors or layering techniques to downplay the size of my belly and create a more balanced look. Any advice on how to make my wardrobe functional, flattering, and comfortable would be incredibly appreciated.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

For context, I‚Äôll include the details of my transformation and condition below. Feel free to AMA if you‚Äôre curious‚Äîthanks so much for your help:

I never thought I‚Äôd be writing this, but after what‚Äôs happened to my body over the past 9+ months, I feel like I‚Äôm living in a surreal medical case study. My wife and I (both 31) are expecting our first children‚Äîtwins!‚Äîand her pregnancy has been going as smoothly as possible. But for me, things took a very bizarre turn. Early in her pregnancy, I began experiencing symptoms of what‚Äôs called Couvade Syndrome, or ‚Äúsympathetic pregnancy,‚Äù where men mimic some of their partner‚Äôs pregnancy symptoms. At first, it was funny‚Äîme complaining about morning nausea and intense cravings while my wife teased me for being dramatic. But as the weeks went on, the symptoms became extreme.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/a/1XUx2qQ) are some photos and videos of me before versus me now in the last couple months of this transformation. 

Within 9+ months, I‚Äôve gained over 130 pounds, and it‚Äôs all gone to my belly.  Doctors have tested me for every possible condition‚ÄîCushing‚Äôs syndrome, hypothyroidism, ascites, insulin resistance, and a laundry list of rare disorders. They ran metabolic panels, hormone tests, and even MRIs to rule out anything that could explain this transformation. Everything came back normal. After countless appointments with endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, and dietitians, the consensus is unanimous: this is the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome they‚Äôve ever seen. My body has gone into a hyper-sympathetic state, mimicking my wife‚Äôs pregnancy so intensely that I now look more pregnant than she does.

Here‚Äôs the wildest part: my belly has grown to an unbelievable 67+ inches in circumference. It‚Äôs perfectly round, heavy, and tight‚Äîso much so that doctors have compared it to an overdue pregnancy with triplets or even quadruplets. I‚Äôve been experiencing cravings, hormonal changes, and even bizarre moments of arousal that have made this entire experience surreal and difficult to process.

The public‚Äôs stares reactions to me have been nothing short of overwhelming. Everywhere I go, people treat me like a walking sideshow attraction. Strangers constantly stop me on the street to ask, ‚ÄúWhen are you due?‚Äù or ‚ÄúAre you having twins‚Äîor is it triplets?‚Äù Sometimes, people assume I‚Äôm joking when I say I‚Äôm not pregnant or assure them that my belly is real, even, and not a costume. One particularly embarrassing encounter happened when a man followed me in his car, yelling ‚ÄúHey, heifer! How‚Äôd you get so huge, fatass!‚Äù and filming me as I struggled to walk. He kept shouting out the window, ‚ÄúWhen are the babies due?‚Äù and even taunted me to run, laughing as I awkwardly waddled down the street. 

Another time, a homeless man trailed me for blocks, loudly asking, ‚ÄúAre you sick? What happened to you? You can still fix this. You look like you‚Äôre about to pop!‚Äù His comments drew stares from others, and the whole experience left me humiliated. Once, at a grocery store, I reached for something on a high shelf, and the movement caused my shirt to ride up, exposing my belly. A woman nearby loudly gasped and asked if I was okay, or pregnant, and when I assured her I wasn‚Äôt pregnant, she looked me up and down in disbelief before walking away, shaking her head.  Thankfully, some guys are entertained or supportive, and say things like ‚ÄúDamn, bro, that‚Äôs the most impressive belly I‚Äôve ever seen. Take care of yourself. That‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù

Our small town caught wind of what was happening to me and even ran a story in the local paper. They did a photo shoot with me and my wife, documenting what they called ‚Äúthe most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome on record.‚Äù The article focused on the medical mystery and included photos of me standing next to my wife, both of us cradling our bellies. At one point, they measured my stomach circumference on camera, which was mortifying. The reporter joked that I looked more overdue than my wife, and the whole experience left me red-faced, especially when people in town started recognizing me from the article and stopping me to ask questions.

Family and friends have been equally baffled. My wife‚Äôs parents were initially concerned and suggested I get immediate medical attention, while my own family didn‚Äôt believe it at first and thought I was exaggerating. Now, it‚Äôs become a mix of humor and genuine concern. Even at work, my coworkers started a playful due date countdown for me, marking it on the office calendar alongside my wife‚Äôs.

Despite the jokes, I feel terrible that my transformation has overshadowed my wife‚Äôs pregnancy. What should have been a time focused on her and the excitement of our twins has turned into a community spectacle about my bizarre condition. She‚Äôs been incredibly supportive and laughs it off, joking that I‚Äôm taking some of the heat off her by becoming the bigger attraction. But I can‚Äôt help feeling guilty‚Äîthis was supposed to be her moment, and instead, I‚Äôm the one everyone‚Äôs talking about.

Meanwhile, I‚Äôve struggled to maintain a sense of normalcy. My shirts don‚Äôt fit anymore, riding up over my belly and exposing the lower half every time I move. I‚Äôve tried buying larger sizes, but even those don‚Äôt last long before I outgrow them. Just the other day, I bent down to tie my shoe at work, and the strain caused a button to pop off my shirt, shooting across the office like a missile. Everyone heard it, and I had to awkwardly laugh it off while turning red. Another time, I stretched to grab something at a 711, and the seam of my shirt tore open right down the side, leaving me scrambling to cover myself. My pants aren‚Äôt any better‚Äîthey‚Äôre so tight under the curve of my gut that I‚Äôve split the seams more times than I care to admit.

At work, I‚Äôm required to wear a uniform‚Äîa button-up shirt, no less‚Äîand squeezing into it has become a nightmare. The buttons pull so tight that I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll pop, and they often do‚Äîsometimes in front of coworkers or even clients, which is humiliating. I‚Äôve started bringing safety pins to hold my shirts together in emergencies, but even those can barely contain the strain. Each week, I‚Äôm outgrowing something else, to the point where I‚Äôm running out of options entirely.

Getting dressed in the morning has become a daily battle. Pulling my pants up under the massive curve of my belly feels like trying to fit into a sausage casing. The waistband digs into me so tightly that it makes my gut stick out even more, exaggerating its size and making me look even more absurdly pregnant. My belt creaks and groans whenever I sit down, and I constantly worry it‚Äôs going to snap. Even sitting in a chair has become a spectacle; I have to ease myself down slowly to avoid bursting buttons or causing the furniture to creak under my weight.

Movement is an entirely different challenge. I can barely bend over to tie my shoes without my belly pressing hard against my thighs, forcing me to hold my breath just to reach the laces. I‚Äôve started wearing slip-ons to avoid the embarrassment. Getting in and out of my car is another ordeal‚Äîit feels like I‚Äôm wedging myself into a tight space, my belly brushing against the steering wheel no matter how far back I push the seat. Walking down the street, my belly bounces and jiggles with every step, drawing stares from passersby. Sometimes, I even catch people filming me.

Everyday tasks that used to be simple now feel monumental, and I‚Äôve stopped pretending I can blend in. Despite my best efforts to maintain normalcy, my transformation has made me impossible to ignore.

Doctors have been fascinated by my condition, describing me as a medical anomaly. They‚Äôve even suggested publishing my case in a medical journal, as they‚Äôve never seen anything like it. While I understand their excitement from a scientific perspective, it‚Äôs hard not to feel like a sideshow. I‚Äôve been poked, prodded, and measured so many times that I‚Äôve lost count.

As for other symptoms/side effects, there‚Äôs a lot more to this experience than just the abdominal growth. Early on, we thought it was kind of adorable how in sync my wife and I were during her pregnancy. I‚Äôd wake up nauseous when she did, I‚Äôd have random cravings, and we joked about how empathetic I was being when I‚Äôd have morning sickness. But as things progressed, it became clear this wasn‚Äôt just harmless sympathy symptoms. My body‚Äôs hormonal changes went into overdrive. Alongside the weight gain, I‚Äôve dealt with intense mood swings, exhaustion, and an unsettling sensitivity to smells. Even little things, like the scent of strong coffee, can send me running for fresh air.  The exhaustion hasn‚Äôt helped with me also not being very active during this time. 

Unlike my wife, I‚Äôm not growing two babies, so everything I eat is turning directly into fat, and unfortunately, it‚Äôs all going straight to my belly. The uncontrollable cravings have been a big part of this. I naturally eat more than her as it is, but the hormonal changes I‚Äôve been experiencing‚Äîlike elevated prolactin and cortisol levels‚Äîhave completely derailed any sense of self-control. It‚Äôs as if my body is craving the transformation itself. There have been times I‚Äôve gone on insane binges, eating until I physically couldn‚Äôt anymore‚Ä¶ Even when I wanted to stop, it felt impossible, I was still hungry, like my body was demanding more fuel to keep growing.

Doctors think my body is in a kind of ‚Äúhyper-storage mode,‚Äù where every calorie is being stored as fat, specifically in my abdomen, almost as if it‚Äôs mimicking a pregnancy. Some specialists believe my fat cells in this area might have become overly sensitive to insulin, leading to the rapid, disproportionate fat accumulation. Others suggest that elevated prolactin levels, typically associated with lactation and maternal behaviors, might be affecting how my body stores fat and retains fluid. Combined with some fluid retention in my belly, it‚Äôs created this bizarre, ballooning effect that feels completely out of my control. It‚Äôs crazy to outgrow a shirt in a matter of a couple weeks. 

One of the more difficult‚Äîand frankly embarrassing‚Äîsymptoms has been this bizarre hormonal arousal.  Sorry if it is TMI to share all of this, but it‚Äôs such a large part of the psychological side effects I‚Äôve been dealing with that it would be hard not to include it. My doctors have explained that the surges of prolactin, cortisol, and other pregnancy-related hormones in my system seem to be ‚Äúconfusing‚Äù my body, tricking it into thinking this transformation is something I‚Äôm meant to desire or enjoy. It‚Äôs almost as though my body is trying to gaslight me into embracing the changes so it can continue expanding. They‚Äôve told me that this is likely part of a feedback loop‚Äîmy body experiences embarrassment or awkwardness from how big I‚Äôve gotten and the trouble I have maneuvering or drawing attention, and that stress triggers a hormonal response that leads to an unexpected surge of arousal. That sensation then clouds my judgment, making me crave situations where I feel even more self-conscious, which leads to choices‚Äîlike overeating or not avoiding tight clothes‚Äîthat exacerbate the growth.

This feedback loop is one of the hardest aspects to navigate. It‚Äôs created a cycle where I feel like I‚Äôm feeding into my own situation, literally and figuratively. The arousal itself feels like my body‚Äôs way of pushing me to keep going, even though I logically don‚Äôt want to get bigger or draw more attention. And yet, I‚Äôve found myself leaning into these situations, almost unconsciously seeking out moments that leave me even more embarrassed or humiliated. It‚Äôs such a strange and difficult headspace to be in because I know it‚Äôs my hormones playing tricks on me, but in the moment, it‚Äôs hard to fight against. The doctors are optimistic that these reactions should subside once my wife gives birth and my hormones stabilize, but until then, I‚Äôm doing my best to stay mindful and not let this cycle get even more out of control.

At the end of the day, I‚Äôm still at a loss. My body feels alien to me, and every day brings new challenges. I‚Äôve started wondering if this condition will reverse after my wife gives birth‚Äîor if this is something I‚Äôll be living with for the rest of my life.

For a second, I wonder if I'm going insane. But insane people don't think that they are going insane, right? Everybody knows that. Is it natural to wonder if my existential dread is triggered by reliving a series of stupid mistakes I made when I first stepped into independence and adulthood? Or is it from repeating these same mistakes knowingly and willingly? It makes me wonder if I‚Äôm some sort of emotional masochist.

The inability to change myself, combined with anxiety and self-awareness, is a sinister mix and the root of my dread. Sometimes, I wonder if it‚Äôs easier to live in denial rather than be self-aware. It‚Äôs time to embrace my feelings instead of bottling them up and projecting a tough exterior. Maybe that‚Äôs the only way I can break out of this vicious cycle of fear and loathing.

I‚Äôm at that phase in life where all my friends have moved on or settled down with family and kids. Being single and pushing 30 is not an ideal place to meet new people or make new friends. I hope to find something real‚Äîcould be a friend, could be something more. A deeper connection and meaningful conversation. Is that too much to ask for? I really hope not.

 - An airport that‚Äôs easy to get to other countries from - we‚Äôd love to travel a bit on weekends 
- We also like city life, including going out for coffee or beers. We're not big clubbers or anything but enjoy live music, particularly indie, so a place where we can go out to gigs would be ideal.  
- A place with lots of young(ish) people is a must for us, we're in our mid to late 20s, so cities with lots of others that range with groups or clubs that are easy join
- would like a city that has some good options for eating out for vegetarian/vegan food too.  
- we're pretty left-wing, so some like-minded people in more of a city that has an artsy vibe would be cool too.

Wala namang maisha-share na big time wins, but this isn't really a rant about the bad sides of the year. For me, 2024 isn't much of a great year, definitely not my best year, but at least not really a bad one.  A fair share of ups and downs, there are good memories, and there are moments of problems and challenges, and times of failure and shortcomings. Di ko exactly alam ano pa masasabi ko sa nagdaang taon. Whatever that is, ang mahalaga ay nakaraos.

Coming from a decision to leave my 1st job, and a week after na-stroke daddy ko late last year, I see this having an effect on how part of 2024 would go. Expected it would be some sort of a challenge, knowing of the uncertainty sa job hunt that I put off until late January-February, para mag focus sa pag-alalay namin ni mommy kay daddy. Sinamahan muna siya sa condo unit ng tita ko sa Pasig, since ung talagang bahay namin na malapit lang doon ay di conducive for his condition that time, and eventually would need repairs if ever gustuhing bumalik. At the time I got my 2nd job, minsan doon muna sa condo tumutuloy para malapit since sa Megamall ako nagwo-work noon. Mabuti na bumubuti agad unti-unti ang lagay niya...fast forward to now he's in better condition though hindi pa 100% fully recovered. Thank God kahit paano naagapan at buhay pa si daddy, at umaayos na talaga lagay niya.

Things started to be a bit complicated ba pagdating sa ugnayan sa pamilya. Ung ate ko na sumagot sa hospital bills ni daddy, unti-unting di na nagpaparamdam sa amin after 2 months since Christmas. Understandable na may work pa siya so weekends lang sila with asawa papalit samin ni mommy sa pagsama kay daddy, para makapahinga kami at makapagpalit ng sets of damit sa Antipolo, since di kayang dalhin lahat and temporary lang naman. Pero unti-unting di nasusunod ang usapan, with my ate no longer showing up, especially after some argument with mommy, kaya limited chances lang makauwi ng Antipolo especially her, unless pumayag tita ko na dun muna siya sa bahay nila sa Cainta lalo na if may lakad kami. And things are turning sour sa ugnayan ng mga parents ko, triggering mommy's anxiety disorder with manic episodes due to stress habang inaalagaan si daddy...though no need for me to dwell much on the issue. So around midyear, just sometime after father's day and saktong kakaalis lang from my 2nd job, mommy decided na iwan muna si daddy sa tita ko. Though he understands na may kundisyon mommy ko, this move including anumang napost niyang some kind of rant didn't sit well with my tita, di na siguro macontrol ung emosyon niya kaya nauwi sa ganun - she even went on a solo Baguio trip. So ayun, dito muna kami sa Antipolo habang marelax at ayusin niya condition nya. Binlock namin asawa ng ate ko, and it seems ate already blocked all of us, not sure sa ibang kamag-anak at pinsan ko, as it seems they're ungrateful dahil tingin nila di namin na-appreciate effort nila to save daddy. While ate seems to already cut us off, it would seem that mommy would do the same for now. So expected na hanggat di sila in good terms with my tita, joining in father's side family gatherings would be out of the question. Even Christmas sa Tagaytay di kami sumama. Kahit ako I was asked not to join them bilang support daw kay mommy while she manages her condition, slightly disagreed on this idea since ako mismo wala namang issue with my relatives eh. So kinukundisyon na sarili namin na focus on staying on mother's side muna. So less family ganaps to look forward to even until this coming year...hanggat hindi pa sila nagkakaayos. Pwede naman if dadalaw kay daddy pero ako lang.

When it comes to my career, halos parang walang nangyari, other than gain some added experience kahit paano. Medj matumal sa umpisa, until I got interviewed for a barista position sa isang upscale coffee shop at their Makati branch around March, na eventually after a month nabalitaang di ako tanggap. Then finally after 5 months job hunting natanggap ako as a barista/dining staff sa isang Singaporean concept cafe/resto, training sa isang mall sa Ortigas with dry run on another nearby upscale mall, supposedly for Antipolo branch na soon-to-open pa lang that time. Thought na all goods na, but even before I actually started in May, a health related issue came from my xray sa part of medical requirement: a suspected pulmonary disease called Koch's Infection, which is related sa TB. So need to do the extra work and gastos para ayusin at ma-clear - from sputum tests to pulmonologist check ups, and was advised na lumiban muna sa duty, uminom na rin ng gamot na nasayang lang din eventually, repeated xray sa reputable hospital. At ayun, cleared naman pala talaga ako at walang sakit, then getting my pulmonary clearance na hiningi din sa akin ng company. But within over a month, I was let go due to mostly that health issue, isama na ung namarkahang AWOL kahit nagpaalam naman tsaka ung physical fitness ko na maaring may konek sa supposed sakit. Despite that, thankful pa rin kay God na cleared ako of disease. Would have been another major plot twist what if, totoo palang may sakit ako? Things would have changed while living a bit isolated from the others (considering TB related so maaring nakakahawa), and we're talking about a disease na hindi biro. Again, salamat Lord wala akong sakit. Even if the unfortunate termination happened after working 1 1/2 months, thought to be an answered prayer I would be thankful for, pero hindi pala para sa akin.

Moving on, as the midyear happens, shortly natanggap agad ako as a store crew for a dessert shop. May rotation ng branches, initially assigned sa Antipolo, then hinihiram sa Marikina, and then napunta sa Cubao, in a span of around over 4 months. Aminadong di pa ako gaano kapulido but I'm trying my best naman and ready namang matuto, but it seems the chances to try and learn are limited, alongside set standards about to be a bit more strictly imposed, especially with an employee checklist in effect to evaluate mga bago if they're good enough para tumagal.  Unfortunately, after Undas at saktong day-off, nakatanggap ako ng memo from management - I got the boot, I'm out. Thought as a blessing pero it looked like as if it was taken away from me. I was like, ano at saan ba ako nagkulang? What if I strived and worked a bit harder, what if mas ginalingan ko pa? Again, I think I did my best, but would have I been better? Pagkukulang ko lang ba talaga or di lang masyado nabigyan ng pagkakataon? Were the chances really there pero di sinamantala masyado, or sadyang hindi sapat? Kung kailan malapit na mag-Pasko and the company was still hiring lalo na kulang sa tao. Easy magtanggal at maghire, pero di gaani kadali tumagal? Well...time to move on. Pahinga muna hanggang kapaskuhan siguro, yun unang nasa isip ko after returning my uniforms, and a month after ay na-claim na ang final pay.

Ganaps sa buhay? Sakto lang. Family gatherings making some good memories. From simple Valentine's day with parents kasabay ng Ash Wednesday at ganap/interview sa ospital where daddy wss invited with incentives. Then my old relative's birthday. Tapos birthday ni lola. Pamamanhikan ng isang pinsan ko. Birthday ni tito na nahati sa dalawang magkahiwalay na araw, una ay simpleng lunch sa bahay nila, then swimming sa weekend. Then Semana Santa sa Antipolo, dun na rin visita iglesia. Nag-summer outing sa Bataan during mother's day weekend, while actually being out from work as per pulmo advise na pinaalam ko pero naging AWOL - being in a situation na di dapat alam ng kamag-anak na may suspected sakit ako, as well as workmates and company not knowing na nag-beach sa kasagsagan ng ""pahinga"" na iyon. Then mother's day catch up night and next day with mommy and lola. Celebrated my birthday a day before actual  day since may duty on the weekend. Then used my 2 hr break para makasama saglit sa birthday dinner ng pinsan in the same mall as my work. Nag-advance father's day during day off, days before being let go sa 2nd job. Fast forward to October 3 requested day offs sa magkahiwalay na araw: kasal ng isang pinsan, fiesta sa Binangonan, then advanced Undas celebration. Then after mawalan ng work, nagkita lang kami ni daddy for a simple birthday treat for him. December may house blessing ung pinsan kong ikinasal. Then sa bilis ng panahon nagPasko na nang simple sa bahay, 2 days before ay simpleng birthday celebration ni mommy. Yun ay ilan sa mga ganaps sa family na still worth looking forward to ngayong 2024. Proof that life goes on, family is love, mahalaga pa rin na may time para sa kanila, sa kabila ng busy lives natin.

And this year, worked on my fitness na rin. Started with daily walks around the subdivision or sa open space sa condo. Then midyear decided to enroll sa gym, pars mapaigting pa ang fitness and health ko. Napagtanto na mahalaga rin talaga ito. Para less risk ng sakit at mas maging fit especially for work. Good thing nakabawas ako ng timbang, from 107kg ay naibaba ko to 89kg. Pero patapos na ang minimum contract na 6 months membership hanggang katapusan ng taon, maintaining near 90-91kg. Part ng sahod ko sa 3rd job ko sa gym napupunta. Medj worth it pa rin. Nakakapaglaan pa rin ng oras for workout bago mag-duty pag masipag, at para di sayang. Goal ko na rin this year maayos ang fitness ko.

So...a balance of good stuff and not so good ones this 2024, not a perfect year. Pero mahalaga ay nakaraos. Got myself a bit more fit. Gained some experience sa 2 work ko kahit hindi nagtagal, sana may natutunan and mag-improve pa. May mga ilang bagong nakilala though di naging close. Despite some family issues na nabanggit, hopefully we're all fine and sana maging maayos na rin eventually. Wala mang spectacular na ganap or big time achievement, basta makaraos at makasurvive.

Still thankful to God for this year 2024. Thankful sa family na naririyan para sa bawat isa, through gatherings and achievements to small wins and stuff worth celebrating. Thankful sa mga nakilala ko sa mga work ko, hindi man naging close na kaibigan, at least feel ko naging parte pa rin ng buhay ko, kasama na mga naituro nyo sa akin sa trabaho.

And now, what am I looking forward to this 2025? Ano na ang sitwasyon pagpasok ng bagong taon. Eto, limitado na lang funds from savings at paubos na final pay. Wala pa ring work pero nagjo-jon hunting na - at may interview ako after new year tapos waiting sa interview results sa nauna pa, along with several pending applications pa. Expecting this year na maaring simpleng buhay lang, maybe a bit boring dahil di na rin masyado nakakalabas o gala, taong bahay lang habang wala pang work - hati ang oras sa job hunt, paglalaro ng games, at magsingit ng exercise, aside sa eat-sleep-repeat routine. Lalabas lang pag may interview or may asikasuhin nang requirements, aside sa pagsisimba every Sunday, or any other essentisls gaya ng grocery, or pag nadaan o nagawi lang somewhere. May civil service exam pa sa March, might need to prep as well. Dadalaw pa rin paminsan-minsan kay daddy sa Cainta pag may chance or if feel or need pumunta. Despite expecting some challenges and a bit of pressure na sana magka-work na soon, I'm still hopeful na makakuha na ng mas matinong trabaho, looking forward to such new beginnings, para patuloy na makaraos nang maayos at eventually umasenso na.

Hello, 2024, goodbye. Eto na naman tayo this week...hello, new year, again. Magsisimula uli. Back to square one ika nga.

Pasensya na kung mahaba. Just wanna unload all my thoughts on how this year 2024 went. Kayo ba, how did your 2024 went by?

Anyway...salamat pa rin 2024! Salamat sa Diyos sa taong ito, hindi man perpekto, pero ang mahalaga ay nakaraos. Praying for hope (and new job) and a better 2025.

**Two things:** 

* Would your vote be for Richmond or Denver area? 
* Is there another city that you think would work for me? I've done so much research but would love help from internet strangers :). 

**The stats:** 

* I'm 35F, single, and mom to two adorable dogs.
* I am from Florida (hate it), have lived in Tennessee (liked it), and lived in Arizona (LOVED it). 

**Seeking:**

* Outdoor adventures are important to me. While my ideal situation is easy access to hiking trails, mountains, etc., I can absolutely compromise with green spaces, biking trails, rivers, etc. My main issue with Florida is it's a fucking peninsula and I like to explore other states and it takes me FOREVER to get out of the state (driving). Would like to be 3-4 hours from mountains.
* I need the sun! I can totally do four seasons but dreary weather (think PNW) or winters filled with temps in the teens (think the Dakotas) are absolute no's for me.
* More progressive. Just wanna be around open-minded people.
* Moderate COL. I'm going back to school for my masters in social work so I'll be on a limited budget. I could top off at $1700 for a studio or 1BR. 
* DOG FRIENDLY
* Solid community of single, young professionals in their 30-40s
* Arts/Museum/Culture, please 
* Local coffee shops, thrift stores, plant nurseries, good food are clutch. Do not care about partying and I don't drink anymore.
* Mid-size city
* Airport is ideal, at least within an hour's drive of one

1hopcg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/tinnitus/comments/1hopcg3/how_ayurveda_helped_me_overcome_tinnitus_and/,How Ayurveda Helped Me Overcome Tinnitus and Reclaim My Life,"I wanted to share my experience with overcoming tinnitus in the hopes that it might help someone else. Tinnitus can feel like a never-ending battle, and Western medicine often focuses only on mitigating symptoms rather than addressing the root cause. Hearing aids and similar solutions didn‚Äôt work for me and even made things worse. What finally helped was Ayurveda, an ancient science that‚Äôs been practiced for over 5,000 years.

Ayurvedic doctors are highly trained, studying traditional medicine alongside Ayurveda-specific practices. Their approach is holistic and homeopathic, meaning the treatments use natural herbs without any harmful side effects. One core aspect of Ayurveda is¬†**Panchakarma**, a therapy designed to detoxify your body deeply. It‚Äôs a rigorous process where they tire your body out and put you in a state of deep detox. This allows your body to heal itself‚Äînot just from tinnitus but from other underlying health conditions as well.

I‚Äôve been to a few Ayurvedic retreats, and while it wasn‚Äôt a quick fix, I‚Äôm now 90% better. It takes commitment‚Äîa minimum stay of 7 nights is required for your body to get into a detox state, though I recommend staying up to 10 days if you can. These retreats are located worldwide, and the Ayurvedic doctors you‚Äôll consult with will also provide tailored lifestyle recommendations.

Here‚Äôs what worked for me, in addition to the treatments:

* No alcohol, no coffee, no stimulants of any kind.
* Sleeping 7‚Äì8 hours a night, consistently.
* Eating clean, healthy food, avoiding fried foods and sugar as much as possible.
* Staying away from Bluetooth devices near my ears.

Healing takes time, and you have to trust the process. When you‚Äôre at these retreats, disconnect from technology, meditate, and fully commit to your recovery. It takes a couple of days for your body to enter the detox state, and that‚Äôs when the real healing begins.

For me, this wasn‚Äôt just about curing tinnitus‚Äîit was about resetting my entire body and mind. I went in feeling hopeless, battling depression and sadness, but Ayurveda gave me my life back. My sister introduced me to this, and I‚Äôll forever be grateful.

I highly recommend giving this a try if you‚Äôre suffering from tinnitus or other chronic conditions. The retreats I visited include:

1. The Ayurveda Health Retreat (Florida)
2. The Raj (Iowa)
3. Ananda in the Himalayas (India)

These places are life-changing, but you have to go in with patience and an open mind. This isn‚Äôt a quick-fix solution‚Äîit‚Äôs a science and methodology that works if you let it.

I‚Äôm now living (mostly) tinnitus-free and enjoying life again. Stay hopeful and take this as a sign to give yourself the gift of healing. ‚ù§Ô∏è",1,1735451004.0,tinnitus,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1 
Arthur Johnson is a cowboy who travels across the country in rodeos and gunslinging events. He holds the world record of fastest draw with a 0.205 second draw. Arthur always wears his dad's cowboy hat he gave him on his deathbed. Throughout his time of traveling, he had made some attachments to the hat. He added a rattlesnake skin brim across his hat that he shot outside his house, an eagle feather that an Indian friend of his gave him in Texas during a tournament in which he got second place, and his world record scorecard, stuffed under his brim. 

 He wore rugged Levi jeans that are covered in dirt and a plain gray shirt with a hole on the left shoulder blade when a bull almost gored him in a rodeo. His boots were leather and shining. His hair was a rich, dark brown, flowing river of chocolate.He stood at 6 '6 and had scars all across his body from the rodeos and broken bones he has been through. During time in his trailer he loved to turn on his radio and play Marty Robbins, or George Strait, an up and coming song writer with his first hit ‚ÄúUnwound‚Äù His trailer was full of trophies from his tours and contests between gunslinging and rodeos, All 1st and 2nd place. He turned to his bed which was half made, and had his dog Bella laying on it. Bella was a german shepherd that fought in vietnam with his dad. Bella was 16 years old and gray hair was covering her body like an abandoned coral reef. ‚ÄúHey Bella,‚Äù Arthur said in his deep southern accent, ‚ÄúHow ya doing?‚Äù Bella said nothing but tilted her head and licked him. ‚ÄúI'm about to shoot, wish me luck‚Äù Arthur said.

 Arthur opens his trailer door after petting Bella and hops on his horse, Dan. He reaches into his pocket and grabs some of the apple slices he cut up ‚Äúhere ya go buddy‚Äù Arthur said while feeding him. His horse neighed in excitement as Arthur whips the horse softly with the reins. As he reaches the contest. The man holding the competition showed the main prize, ‚ÄúA .41 caliber Colt Thunderer from 1877‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthe same one Billy The Kid used until his death.‚Äù The sounds of shocked people filled the room. Arthur knew he needed that gun.

 As everyone lined up,  3 loud beeps played at the beginning of a higher pitched beep, initiating it was time to shoot, BANG! Multiple shots rang out at the timed targets that stopped when hit. 0.204, Arthur broke his old world record and achieved a new time. The crowd was ecstatic, screaming and whistling erupted. Arthur was celebrating and was yelling and whooing. He walked to the podium where the event holder was waiting. As Arthur shook his hand multiple flashes of cameras erupted blinding him faster than he could shoot. He grabs the .41 and carefully examines it. 21 notches were engraved on the gun marking the men that Billy killed.

 After the celebrating and shooting Arthur got home and showed the gun off to Bella. ‚ÄúLook, the gun Billy the kid used!‚Äù Arthr said enthusiastically to bella.. Again she tilted her head saying nothing. In the morning, Arthur got up early to go shoot the gun. He cracked some eggs into a pan and cooked them with cheese to make an omelet. He then sat by Bella and pets her old scruff. He hops onto Dan and rides. He puts in a .210 round and looks down the sights, as he pulls the loosened hammer back, finally, the gun of the legend himself, not fired nor touched since 1881. He shoots.

 As he pulled the trigger the bullet escaped the iron chambers firing true to its target, but everything slowed down, The gun glowed brightly and lifted Arthur into the air. Arthur, afraid for his life, didn't let go and was screaming so loud, gunslingers shot off 2 miles away thinking it was the machine beeps. As he looked down he saw the earth tilting the opposite way going 100s of lightyears faster. It all stopped. As he floated down to the ground, A sign on a saloon said ‚Äúfounded 1855-1881‚Äù

Chapter 2
Arthur looks around huffing and puffing, his hand trembling as he grabs for his gun, and is still thinking ‚Äúwhat the hell just happened.‚Äù As he surveys his surroundings, he sees people with wagons whipping at their horses as the wheels creak and groan on every turn. He sees animal pelts and deer being carried by strong thoroughbred horses that were kicking up dust from every step their homemade horseshoes took. As he turned around he saw a young man petting his horse. Arthur pulls his gun and aims down range at the man ‚ÄúW‚Äìwho are you?‚Äù Arthur said in a trembling voice. 
‚ÄúMy name is Billy, Billy The Kid.‚Äù At that moment, Arthur  froze. Is this the real Billy, or is he just imagining it? After a lot of thinking, Arthur lowered the gun and swiftly holstered it.


‚ÄúWhere am I?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou are in the ‚ÄúWild West‚Äù as y‚Äôall call it‚Äù Billy says, throwing up finger guns. ‚ÄúAnd it seems you have my weapon.‚Äù Billy continues ‚ÄúOnce I died, I knew whoever shot this gun next, would be a master‚Ä¶ so I cursed it. Whoever shot the gun, comes back to my time and will kill the man who killed me.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd that was Sheriff Pat Garret?‚Äù Arthur wondered.

‚ÄúYes it was.‚Äù Billy said.

‚ÄúYea‚Ä¶ no, I'm going back.‚Äù Arthur grabbed the gun, and in a smooth motion, he shot it. He closed his eyes and awaited the gun lifting him in the air.
‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù Billy tried speaking through laughter.

‚ÄúI'm trying to get out of here.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt aint that easy son, here follow me.‚Äù As Billy walked to his horse, he hopped on, ‚Äúwell, you gonna get on yours?‚Äù as Arthur looked around, he saw his horse ‚ÄùDan!‚Äù Arthur runs to his horse and brushes his coat. To the side of Dan, was his dog Bella. ‚ÄúOh my god, Bella, how'd you get here?‚Äù Bella jumps on him, licking his face, still not talking.
‚ÄúYour most beloved objects or animals will get transferred over here with you.‚Äù Billy said. 
After the greetings Arthur finally accepts the challenge and hops onto Dan.As they walk on the trails he sees everybody looking at him in a different way, he wondered if it were his horse, but looking down he saw it. His bright ‚Äúgold‚Äù belt buckle. ‚ÄúDo‚Ä¶do they think my buckle is real gold?‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, yea, you should probably take that off before you get robbed. We are going through El Paso.‚Äù After riding for a few hours they set up camp and grabbed dry wood to set up a fire. As Billy closes his eyes, he cocks the hammer of his gun back, and tells Arthur to do the same.

 Late at night, Arthur woke up to gunshots whizzing past the camp, still in a daze, he aimed and fired. He heard fleeing in the distance as he got up, he saw Billy standing over where he shot. ‚ÄúWhat did I shoot Billy?‚Äù
‚ÄúYou shot a thief.‚Äù Arthurs mind was racing, did he really just kill a man trying to survive out here? Will this affect the future? He looks down at his hands, trembling. After all the time he has hunted, shot revolvers, and even rifles, His hands have never felt this way. His heart drops down to his stomach as he throws up on the ground. ‚ÄúShot him good too‚Äù Billy laughs it off and goes back to bed. Arthur did not sleep that night.

 In the morning Arthur and Billy saddled up and continued down the trail, Arthur passed by cottonwood trees through towns with nooses, towns with gunshot holes through banks and saloons, sherrifs with their eyes on a swivel making sure gangs didn't come by. After another long day of riding, Billy stopped to show him a blind beggar, ‚Äúthese guys are common ‚Äòround here, some fake, some not.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow can you tell?‚Äù 

‚ÄúLike this‚Äù Billy pulled his gun out and hid it behind his horse, As they got closer, not saying a word, he pulled the gun on the man. The man fled from the ground and started yelling and running away begging for his life ‚Äúdon't never trust no man who says he's blind‚Äù Billy exclaimed.

Chapter 3

As Billy and Arthur continue on the trail, they pass numerous travelers and even see a Conestoga wagon heading to Idaho, the license plate was I3d-e3, He looked up at the people and threw them a glass cup , they nodded as a thank you. They were used to support troops during the American-Indian War. Arthur And Billy set up camp 15 miles away from El Paso. This time, Arthur and Billy set up camp 15 miles from El Paso. This time, Arthur cocked his revolver, gripping it tightly as he surveyed the flat but concealed landscape.

 Dan was tied around a tree branch with Arthurs riata, and Bella was snuggling up to him sniffing the ground. Billy was next to the fire cooking some veil he kept in his horse bag. The smell of fresh food kept Arthur tired. Gunshots rang out, 15 men surrounded the position, Arthur shot off a round into the dark, hearing a thud. He looked to his left, he saw Dan lying lifelessly and Bella in his arms not moving. At that moment Arthur was shot. ‚ÄúAGH‚Äù Arthur screamed as he awoke from his bag pointing the gun into the night. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù Billy said half awake carrying his revolver. Billy looked through the trees making sure not the slightest of movements happened. ‚ÄúNothing, just a bad nightmare is all.‚Äù Arthur sounded tough, but he was holding onto Bella while shaking vigorously under the bag.

 In the morning, They untied the horses and rode them through El Paso stopping at a saloon to grab a drink and some food. As they walked in, The doors creaked open. As they walked in, they heard the sounds of music playing from the piano, and people chattering talking about their lives. They order some sausage and eggs and a cup of coffee.

 At this point, Arthur had his belt buckle in his bag making sure nobody would see it. After breakfast they get out of El Paso quickly and head up to Fort Summer, New Mexico. Billy told Arthur that this journey would take 7-10 days, ‚ÄúI shoulda died closer to here huh‚Äù Billy laughs as he says this. Arthur ignores this as he scans the openings. ‚ÄúShh,‚Äù Arthur whispered. ‚ÄúI see something.‚Äù Suddenly, five Native Americans emerged from the grass, aiming shotguns and rifles at them.

 Arthur looks closely at Billy, As Billy nods, Arthur whispers to himself Hoping this is right. He pulls his revolver on the men, Thanks to the loosened hammer, he shoots the man quicker than one could blink, He pulls the hammer back once again and shoots the one behind Billy. Billy then pulled his gun and shot 2 of the others Who still didn't move not knowing what happened. The last one ran away saying he's telling the Sheriff. Arthurs heart rate increases to an incredible rate, his eyes locked onto the men laying before him. ‚ÄúWHOO! Nice shooting kid!‚Äù Billy kneels down, ripping out golden teeth from the men. Hopping on his horse, Billy continues.

 For the Past Few days, they rode and camped until they finally got to Billy‚Äôs friend's house, Peter Maxwell. On July 14, 1881 Billy was in the room sitting on the couch. ‚ÄúThis is it son. Avenge me.‚Äù There was a knock on the door. ‚Äú¬øQui√©n es?‚Äù Billy asked. Arthur heard whispers saying ‚ÄúThat's him‚Äù A gun cocks and fires. Billy falls to the ground lifeless, Blood dripping from his wound. Arthur Is frozen. He is shaking and scared for his life. He pulls his gun on Pat Garret,  ‚ÄúI declare for a duel‚Ä¶ Right now!‚Äù Arthur said

‚ÄúSon, You don't know who I am, You don't want this.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you are backing down, sheriff?‚Äù Arthur says in confidence.
‚ÄúFine, At the end of 10 more clicks, we shoot.‚Äù Arthur leans backwards, keeping his eyes slanted, he hovers over the revolver that his friend gave him. 5 clicks pass, As he gets ready, he thinks to himself, A rodeo and gunslinging sport cowboy cant do this. But he has no time to think. 8 clicks pass now, He looks garret in the eyes and aims for where he wants to hit him. 10 clicks are heard. In an instant Arthur slides the revolver back into his hand, lowering down the hammer, with an instant boom. The sheriff didn't even have time to pull his gun.

Chapter 4
After Arthur Shot Pat Garret. He looked at Billy, Billy was still breathing as he saw Arthur win the duel. Arthur rushes over to him and says ‚ÄúI did it, I killed him, Now what.?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnce I die Your adventure will be fully Completed and the gun will bring you back to where you were.‚Äù

Billy whispers, ‚ÄúI'm glad you got my revolver. In return I will Let you go and let you keep it, Not like I'll need it anyway‚Äù Billy laughs as he coughs, he slumped over to his side and let out the last breath he would ever have. At that moment, The gun lit up brighter than ever before, He lifted up, coming through the roof of the house where two bodies lay, Time started moving faster, But this time, Arthur did not close his eyes or scream, He held on and watched as streaks of light pass near him zooming quickly like the shot of a bullet. As he looked up, he saw stars dying in front of him and new ones being reborn. The stars' bright lights slowly turned darker and the lights slowed down. He starts his descent and lands back at the shooting range.
 Arthur gets shocked, After all that time gone, and everything is the same, The same birds flying above him, BANG, the same gunslingers shooting at targets. He looks at the gun, magically 6 more notches appear on the gun. Marking the people he killed, The thief in the beginning, the 4 Indians that had him and Billy at gunpoint, And finally, Sheriff Pat Garret. 
After reminiscing on what just happened, He hopped on Dan and reached for his gold buckle and putting it back on, He gave Dan Some sausage he saved from the breakfast and trotted back home. Keeping his eyes peeled, he makes it back home to ‚ÄúBella!! How you doing, baby?‚Äù Bella continues looking at him, Licking at his face not saying anything.

 In his next contest up north in idaho He stops at a museum where he sees a conestoga wagon with the same license plate as the one he saw. It said on the pamphlet it was the main reason America won the war. It was carrying Cannon balls and gunpowder, And a single glass cup. As a faint smile appeared on Arthur's face. 

He walked out in front of the crowd. Cheering and yelling everywhere at once. He went to the microphone and said. ‚ÄúThank you all for coming out to this event,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI want to say one thing before we start this, Gunslinging ain‚Äôt just a sport, It isn't just a competition or a game, It is history, Without this america would not be shaped into what it is today, Many outlaws, or sheriffs used the technique to help each other out. We need to remember that this used to be used for killing, now we need to use it as comradery and remembership of those who died and made this such an amazing event.‚Äù Hundreds of people started screaming, applauding, and cheering at his speech. He lifted his finger to shush everyone and said, in his deep and rugged voice. ‚ÄúLet's get this show on the road!‚Äù

  CHAPTER 10: The Final Price
Arthur stood at the edge of the canyon, his boots sinking into the dry dirt. The wind howled through the rocky landscape, kicking up dust as the sun dipped low behind the jagged mountains. His Colt Thunderer was heavy in his hand, its worn handle comforting but cursed. He could feel the weight of all the lives it had taken. Each notch on the barrel was a reminder of the path he had walked, a path filled with violence and regret.
Across from him stood the man he had come to kill, a figure from Billy the Kid‚Äôs past, a man whose betrayal had shattered the fragile alliances of the Old West. This man, now the leader of a ruthless band of outlaws, had been the true architect of Billy‚Äôs death‚Äîand now he was the last obstacle standing between Arthur and peace. The final ghost from the past had come to claim him.
Arthur‚Äôs heart raced as he gripped the Colt tighter, the memory of his fallen friends and all the bloodshed fresh in his mind. He had been running from this moment since he first held the cursed gun, but now, there was no turning back. This was the end.
The outlaw leader sneered, a wicked grin spreading across his scarred face. ‚ÄúSo, it‚Äôs come to this, huh? You think you can end it all with a bullet?‚Äù The man‚Äôs hand hovered over the holster of his own revolver, but Arthur didn‚Äôt flinch.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù Arthur said, his voice low and steady, ‚ÄúThis ain‚Äôt about you or me. It‚Äôs about what I‚Äôve become. It‚Äôs about the price I‚Äôve paid.‚Äù
With a sudden motion, the man drew his gun. A flash of steel, a split second in time, and the crack of gunfire echoed across the canyon.
Arthur felt the bullet tear through his side, the searing pain igniting his body. He staggered, dropping to one knee, the Colt Thunderer slipping from his hand. His vision blurred as the blood soaked through his shirt, but through it all, he kept his gaze fixed on the man who had condemned him to this fate.
The outlaw stood over him, a mocking laugh escaping his lips. ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt it fitting, Johnson? You were always fast with that gun, but you couldn‚Äôt outrun your own demons.‚Äù
Arthur‚Äôs chest heaved, his breaths shallow. He knew his time was up. The life he had led‚Äîfull of blood and vengeance‚Äîhad finally caught up with him. But in his fading consciousness, one thought remained clear: I did what I had to do, not for revenge, but to end the curse.
His hand reached for the Colt Thunderer, his fingers brushing against the cold metal as the world around him began to fade. He couldn‚Äôt pull the trigger. He wasn‚Äôt sure if it was because he was too weak or because, in the end, he had made his peace.
And then, just as the darkness claimed him, a strange warmth filled his chest. The gun‚ÄîBilly‚Äôs gun‚Äîglowed faintly, just like it had when he first fired it, sending him back in time. But this time, it wasn‚Äôt a portal to the past. It was a final reckoning.
As Arthur slipped into unconsciousness, he felt something he hadn‚Äôt felt in a long time: peace. The curse had come full circle. He had avenged Billy, confronted his demons, and paid the price for his actions. The cycle was broken. There would be no return, no time travel, no more running.
Arthur Johnson, the world‚Äôs fastest draw, closed his eyes for the final time, a quiet smile playing on his lips.
The End

1hopadr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SupportforBetrayed/comments/1hopadr/i_think_i_am_finally_healing/,I think I am finally healing.,"For the longest time I was so pathetic.  I thought I was the problem. I spent seven years trying to be good enough.  

He spent seven years constantly fucking prostitutes and coworkers and literally anyone who would respond or tolerate him.  He lied, he stole from me, he nearly gave me STDs, he constantly encouraged my eating disorder because a healthy BMI is ‚Äúfat‚Äù, he scared the shit out of me by screaming and smashing things, and he berated me for the last two years about how I was financially irresponsible when it turns out the entire reason we are always broke is that he is paying $300/hr to fuck whores.

Something snapped in me for good I think.  Maybe one time I could accept is a mistake.  Seven years of this (plus paying for it, pathetic) means this is who he is and he will never change.  It has been a painful three months of coping through the holidays. 

Except something changed this week.

I don‚Äôt think I need to cope anymore.  

Maybe he has finally crushed all of the romantic love out of me.  I‚Äôve spent three months being numb, and in retrospect that was my brain adjusting to the new reality.  Now for the first time in seven miserable years I have felt a spark of hope because I realize I am finally ready to give up on him and love myself instead. 

I am slowly realizing that everything I loved in him was really a projection of my own goodness.  And that is making me appreciate myself for the first time.  Christ, I am an objectively amazing person when I look at me from the third person.  What was I ever thinking settling for someone like him? 

I even still love him in a platonic way.  Isn‚Äôt that funny?  He couldn‚Äôt break me.  I am 30 but still the same idealistic teenage girl on the inside who truly believes within every single person is a spark of pure divinity and every interaction is ultimately a lesson and a blessing, no matter how painful. Maybe this is what forgiveness feels like.  I do not hold it against him that he abused me; he is not capable of being anything better.  I can still love him from a distance and wish him the best despite everything.  It is far more painful to be someone like him than it is to be someone like me.  Maybe that was the lesson. 

The next year is going to suck hard.  He is like all abusive spouses in that he goes nuclear when he thinks I might leave.  When he found out I was speaking to OBS he attempted to fake a DV accusation to get a TRO against me + hiring a PI to follow me around and report back. Insanity. I have finally been forced to accept he is dangerous.  I hate that the person I loved never really existed. I hate that I had to ask one of his friends to remove all the guns from the house so he wouldn‚Äôt try to kill me.  But nevertheless ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm okay?  Weird. 

I‚Äôm forcing myself to do the right thing.  I found all the necessary divorce papers and am saving up for the filing fees.  I downloaded Tinder, Hinge, and Bumble if only to prove to myself that other men do in fact find me attractive.  I‚Äôm not ugly and worthless like he thinks I am. He hates being seen with me so we never really did date type stuff.  I‚Äôm actually kind of giddy at the idea of going on a date for the first time in my entire life (at age 30 lmao), even if it‚Äôs just getting coffee and walking through a park with some hot guy.  I think I would really really love that. 

But I‚Äôm gonna be single and fall in love with myself first.  And I‚Äôm gonna be okay.

1hop880,https://www.reddit.com/r/bartenders/comments/1hop880/concentrated_cold_brew_for_the_bartenders_working/,Concentrated Cold Brew! For the bartenders working on a budget.,"So I work at a bar that has an unwillingness to order certain things that I, or a customer, might want. It's strictly ""what's on the menu"" (despite us handling 1400 customers at a time on certain days). I'm sure most of us have dealt with something similar. My recent issue was having some regulars that wanted to be able to order espresso martini's. I've made thousands of these, just at bars that were prepared to make them. I like to make the people that pay my bills happy, so I started doing my research.

The easiest solution I could think of was a cold brew. I've never had to make one, because I've always just had real espresso or an alternative that was regularly ordered by the bar. The only thing I could find online was recipes saying that I needed a darker roast grinded into a coarse grind. The more I read, the more I had this thought. What if I don't have a grinder? What if I don't have coffee beans? What if I just work at a local crapplebees and just want to make a couple regulars happy? I was determined to find a solution, even though I never drink coffee nor make it. I guess I'm just weird like that. So I started experimenting.

My initial thought on this was as follows:  I wanted a solution that would cost very little to no money for me. It had to be with the most basic of supplies that every bar had. The recipe I used for the cocktail has Vodka, Kahlua, Simple, and Espresso in whatever ratio you prefer. I usually use around 1.5oz of espresso in mine. So I'm assuming that almost all bars have some form of Vodka, simple, and Kahlua. The end product doesn't have to be ""the best"" like every recipe says for cold brew, I just wanted it to be passable. The customer didn't have to say it was the best espresso martini they ever had, as long it was a decent enough cocktail for my standards. Last note that I thought of while starting the experiment was I wanted the brew process to take around 14 to 24 hours. Any quicker/later, and any bartender probably wont make it back to the bar in time to filter it themselves.

The only coffee I have that I can get regularly are those cheap silver and orange bags that most common restaurants have. The really cheap, nasty ones that don't usually have a brand name or even a description on what the coffee was. After some online searching, I had to make the assumption that it was a medium roast with a medium grind. The recipe I started with that I used as a baseline was 25g coarse/dark coffee to 1 cup of water for 18hours in the fridge.

So I started the experiment. Online, it said that I should avoid using a medium grind, and it had to be a dark roast to get the full flavor. I ignored this. I did find a helpful side note mentioned on reddit that someone said they make a regular cold brew with cheap coffee. They just did it for 12 hours sitting on the counter. It also had a discussion on how if it brewed any longer, the caffeine content would get really high. This initially made me cautious. 12 hours isn't long enough for me to make it back to the bar, so I stuck with the fridge. I figured since it was a medium grind, the surface area would be so significant that if I followed that exact recipe, it was going to kill someone. I did eight different variations, starting with the original as a base. All other seven were slight reductions in the ratio leading down to 12g of coffee to 1 cup of water. I put all of these in plastic Pepsi cups that you get in bulk at restaurants (don't ask why I had them). I left these in the fridge for 16 hours (I was really nervous I was going to kill someone with a caffeine overdose). The idea was when these were done, I was going to taste test all of them and decide which one I liked best. Continue experimenting if I need to. I filtered them all with a random nut milk bag I happened to have and made that as a mental note on costs. They filtered almost instantly. I noticed they were still slight murky, So I decided to filter them through a coffee filter as well. This took about 3 min on each batch. Then I was ready.

I made a quick trip to my local coffee shop and asked her if I could get two shots of espresso in a cup. She looked at me really weird. I then let that chill for a while in the fridge and sat down with all my coffee to taste test. My initial thought was that the espresso was much thicker than any of my coffees. All of my concentrated cold brews were at least slightly see-through. I tasted the base recipe and noticed that it was much stronger than a regular cup of coffee, but was still not that close to the level of what my espresso was.  I felt a little defeated. I thought ""If I take this recipe any further, it might be way too caffeinated to serve someone. I went ahead and made the cocktails out of both to see. The espresso was obviously beautiful, and tasted great. The foam held sitting there for an hour. The cold brew foam lasted for almost 10 min, which is plenty long enough for it to hit a table. I was not too disappointed in the taste either. The coffee definitely could be stronger though. I was just slightly disappointed with it enough to say I wouldn't serve it. I thought I was done.

I then realized that I had a couple friends that work at a coffee shop that I could ask some of my weird questions to. They reassured me that because of the lower roast, the ability of the caffeine to get that high is very low. Might even be impossible. I can also make an assumption that as long as a customer didn't drink too many, they would assuredly be fine. Nobody orders a full cup of espresso for a reason. With that assurance, they helped me work out a new recipe to try. I went from 25oz to 35oz of coffee to 1 cup water for 18 hours in the fridge instead of 16. I actually made this one in a larger batch to fit a 1000mL bottle. The result was...adequate. Which was exactly what I was going for! It had a dark color very similar to the espresso. The boldness of flavor almost matched, though not necessarily the goodness of flavor lol. The resulting espresso martini had a good enough coffee kick that I was satisfied with. I plan to continue to slightly adjust as I strive for the best, worst concentrated cold brew I can make.

The resulting solution can be made with the simple cost of a nut milk bag. This is assuming that your bar has cheap coffee, a funnel, several weirdly shaped containers, coffee filters, vodka, coffee liqueur, and simple syrup. I wanted to post this to see if anyone else wanted to experiment and give input as well.

TLDR: I made cheap Cold Brew with crappy restaurant coffee. The recipe was 35g of coffee to 250mL in the fridge for 18 hours. Its barely passable, but I'm happy with the results. I did this for all you struggling crapplebees bartenders out there (I used to be one, rock on).",3,1735450561.0,bartenders,1,1.0,False

Adam was sitting in the office when Doc knocked on the door, which confused him for a moment. Evelyn was back at the military base and had not told him about Doc's visit.

‚ÄúCome in, Doc. That can't be your name. Should I just call you Doc?‚Äù Adam said as he let him into the office. The man smiled as he indicated to the chair to ask if he could sit. Adam nodded.

‚ÄúEverybody calls me Doc, but my name is David O‚ÄôConnell.‚Äù And Adam chuckled.

‚ÄúDoc, yeah, I get it, and you‚Äôre a doctor on top. No wonder. ‚Äú He said as Doc sat down. ¬†

‚ÄúSo, let's get it over with. Who did you marry?‚Äù Adam asked, and Doc looked at him a little surprised.

‚ÄúHer name back then was Lisa Chiba, and she was from the Asian division. She wanted to be a lawyer,‚Äù Doc replied; he felt slightly uncomfortable about bringing it up. Adam just smiled.

‚ÄúShe changed her name to Kiko But kept her last name, and she got into Oxford in London, right? Or did she graduate?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHow? Did you?‚Äù Doc was confused, and Adam shrugged. It was my job from when I was fourteen, and the oldest of us was forced to step into the real world. I wrote recommendation letters for everybody who wanted. ¬†We had a forum where anybody could ask for help and guidance on how to get a job, like 'I want to be a lawyer, what schools and grades I need?' that kinda stuff. One guy wanted to know how to be a big bug exterminator. Who in their right mind wants to be one of those guys?‚Äù Adam asked, and Doc just stared at him before snapping out of it.

‚ÄúYou wrote her a recommendation letter? ‚Äú

‚ÄúI wrote tons of those letters, and I even worked as an intern for a judge to learn more about it. Hell, I almost became a lawyer myself. I didn‚Äôt aim for Oxford, I thought. I went to Luna. Three years. ‚Äú

‚ÄúWow, her mind would blow if she found out. Ehh. There is one thing I want to talk to you about. Something that Doctor Hara said. She said she had fixed you, that you‚Äôre no longer sterile.¬† I hope I‚Äôm not overstepping my boundaries here, but you know. ‚Äú Doc was getting even more uncomfortable now. ‚ÄúThe one thing most of you guys want is that fixed. We have been thinking about how to get around it, we already adopted two, but I know she ... fuck.. ‚Äú He was clearly feeling uncomfortable, yet Adam could see that Doc felt this was so important that he would endure the embarrassment of asking.  
  
‚ÄúI will talk to Hara about it; maybe she can train you in how to fix it; if not, then just have her visit, and we will fix it here,‚Äù Adam said with a smile.

‚ÄúBut, I thought you didn‚Äôt want any of yours to know where you are. ¬†You wanted privacy, right?‚Äù Doc replied as he was getting over his embarrassment.

‚ÄúLook, I can‚Äôt hide forever; the universe won't let me, so let's just get this over with. Yes, you can tell her I‚Äôm here; just don‚Äôt tell her about the recommendation. The last thing I need is more people thinking they owe me something. Okay?‚Äù Adam said, and Doc nodded, a bit relieved. Then he looked at his pad and took a deep breath.

‚ÄúUnfortunately, there is more. The Brass wants an accountant of the planet and you. Normally, they want us to do this clandestinely, but honestly, I think I can get a better overview by simply asking if you don‚Äôt mind. You, being a marine, know how the brass is and the politicians.‚Äù

Adam chuckled. ‚Äúyeah. Okay, I‚Äôll order coffee for us, and we can start.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWait, let me see if I get this straight.¬† Besides the whole system, you have a mining company that is going to the nearby system to mine as it‚Äôs open, as well as the asteroid field. Then you get the Nitrogen project and a transport company and waste company? And we haven‚Äôt even started on Dirt?‚Äù¬† Doc looked over the files.  
  
‚ÄúYou are forgetting the Mudskin maid-droids, and there are a few more investments, ‚Äú Adam said, and Doc looked at him.

‚ÄúGod damn it, man? How much are you worth? No, don‚Äôt tell me. All of this has already classified you as a megacorporation. ‚Äú Doc said, and Adam was about to laugh but stopped.

‚ÄúShitt‚Ä¶ Not what I planned. Okay, let's get to the planet. Let's see. We have a few M-polo bases. We can start with Piradas, which is also my home and now functions as the administrator of Dirt. Then we got Mordor near the volcanic site; they are working on removing volcanic ashes and gasses. It‚Äôs a nice project. Then there is Maranda, where we do most oceanic research. There are also twenty small oceanic bases spread across different ocean floors. They all work with spreading aquatic flora and fauna like algae and fish. Then there is the Zoo. That‚Äôs the second M-polo base that was built. It's now the Vorts office, then the university asked for a place, so we built another for them. ¬†I have three more licenses, but I think I will try something else.¬† And, of course, we had new Macau and Hades. ‚Äú

‚ÄúHades?‚Äù Doc asked, confused.

‚ÄúA factory city will be a holding area if we get too many immigrants and don‚Äôt have a place in the cities or the villages.

‚ÄúVillages?‚Äù Doc said, and Adam pulled up a live feed of villages. It was a small dome about 500 meters in diameter, and attached to it were seven large greenhouses about a kilometer long and a hundred meters wide.

  
‚ÄúWe had three. Now, we have fifteen; these are fully automated, but we are looking for farmers. We are self-sufficient with food now; well we just got as of last week.‚Äù Adam said, ‚ÄúMostly, I just make planes now, and Jork and Vorts magically make it happen. I suspect they have some bureaucracy they are hiding from me.‚Äù

‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt you deal with it?‚Äù Doc was surprised, and Adam laughed and pressed a button that showed an office with three aliens working. A butler droid aided them.

‚ÄúNaw, as you can see. They are working hard. That‚Äôs how we do it here. Jork And Vorts are playing a game. How can we surprise and impress Adam? I play the game of finding out all their hidden projects and checking if they are doable. ‚Äú

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre crazy,‚Äù¬† Doc said, and Adam chucked as he saw Evelyn entering the administration and heading towards the office.

‚ÄúYeah, I will make it official once we really need them. Besides that, we have a shipbuilding company that mainly produces haulers, transports, and exploration ships.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd a new fighter. I‚Äôm looking forward to that one,‚Äù Doc said as Evelyn entered and stopped.

‚ÄúAm I disturbing?‚Äù She asked, and Adam got up.  
‚ÄúNaw, just helping him with the report for the Brass. He is smart; sometimes, it‚Äôs better to ask than sneak around. I was happy to help.‚Äù Adam replied, and Evelyn looked at Doc.

‚ÄúOkay. I guess you‚Äôre finished. You need to go over the other reports and send them as well, as well as the request list.‚Äù Evelyn told Doc, who got up.

‚ÄúOf course, sir. Oh, last thing. Did you ask him about what we discussed last night?‚Äù the doctor asked her, and she looked at Adam.

‚ÄúI was about to bring it up. They are wondering how many civilians you are allowed to move here.¬† With an outpost, some hoped they could bring family here while they served. Might help with speeding the colony process.‚Äù ¬†¬†She said, and Adam laughed.  
‚ÄúYou think you had to ask? They can all come. Look, it‚Äôs a pretty big planet, and if we need to build a new city, then we do just that.¬† Just do the minimum of vetting, okay?‚Äù

Doc smiled, saluted Evelyn, and nodded to Adam. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs all I needed to hear. Thank you so much.‚Äù Then he left, and Evelyn looked at him. ‚ÄúLunch?‚Äù  Adam nodded as a message came in, and he read it.

‚ÄúWow, damn.‚Äù He said, and Evelyn looked at him in confusion.

‚ÄúGood or bad news?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs from the university. They have over a thousand applications for the University department here. They asked if we could build more dorms. The first thousand and staff will arrive next month.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought you already had students here?‚Äù

‚ÄòYeah, but we build them an M-polo base to use as a department from the university, with a dorm for a thousand.¬† They just filled it up. What the hell is so important about Dirt that they  all want to come here?‚Äù Adam asked.

1hop7lo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1hop7lo/stressing_over_mil/,Stressing over MIL,"I‚Äôm a little over 12 weeks pregnant after a 3 year stretch of infertility. Before my husband and I got married, my mother in law gave my husband his unused college fund to purchase a home. She does a lot of stuff like this to hang it over his head, and reminds him constantly when his family business can‚Äôt afford to pay him, she does it out of her own bank account. She moved to a different state this past year and comes down frequently to visit, always staying with us. I love her, and am thankful for what she has provided him. But truthfully she can be quite overbearing, and tends to make things about herself. 

When we found out we were pregnant, we ended up having to tell them way before I would have intended to. They came down for a wedding and my husband and we knew they‚Äôd know by the fact that I stopped drinking. She basically announced it to other people at the wedding by telling them the fake drink I was sipping on was only Club soda and lime.

For Christmas, they came down and have been with us for two weeks. I have been allowing myself to have a small bit of coffee each morning. The other day she said I needed to watch my intake and should stop completely. She‚Äôs very pushy and a bit condescending about what I should and shouldn‚Äôt do‚Ä¶ for another example, I started taking Pepcid before 12 weeks because I was having terrible acid reflux and tums were not helping. She went on to say that I shouldn‚Äôt be taking anything (even if that means not being able to eat). Tonight we went to a Christmas party and while I have been casually announcing, she is very quick to do the announcing for me. It‚Äôs not something I can just mention in passing. She had to start every conversation with ‚Äúso guess what‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to be a grandma‚Äù. 

A few days ago, I mentioned my disdain with certain vaccines based on very good research and she scolded me. I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs excited but also can‚Äôt help but feel like she is ruining my experience of becoming a mother and will very likely intrude on my parenting choices. 

She is planning to come down and stay for an entire month after the birth. I work for a small law firm and will not be paid for my maternity leave - and so I am saving my own money to be able to afford 6 weeks off to heal and bond my MY child. I DO NOT want her staying at the house and do not want visitors during that time for more than 1-2 hours max, including her and my own family. But I have this terrible feeling she is going to force her way in and try to overstay, give nonsolicited and unwanted advice, and be pushy about how we are choosing to learn how to care for our newborn. 

I tried to mention this very lightly to my husband about how it was making me feel. He had nothing to say really. I think he is scared to stand up to her based on the amount of money she spends on him and her propensity to storm off and cry when people point out that she is being invasive. Last time she was here, she threw a bottle of makeup remover away that wasn‚Äôt fully empty when she cleaned our bathroom. I told my husband I didn‚Äôt want her going in our room but she took it upon herself. When I gently mentioned that it was missing, she accused me of being messy and stormed into the bathroom to look for it only to prove that it was truly gone. Then she burst into tears and it felt like she was trying to make me the bad guy. She is extremely defensive and sensitive when you prove her wrong or state your opinion differs from hers. 

I‚Äôm really beginning to worry about this and not sure what I need to do to 1) get my husband to listen to my concerns / help me calm them and 2) have an adult conversation with her about boundaries when the baby comes. The control of my parenting skills and my baby‚Äôs life cannot be the source of her happiness or easing her anxieties.

1hop6g1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransLater/comments/1hop6g1/the_difference_a_year_makes/,The difference a year makes ,"12 months ago I was sitting here, MTF, 61, been on HRT about 6 months, I'd just had a second set of piercings done on my ears, hair to my shoulders and with only my SO, my doc and my brother/SIL (told them last Sept) knowing about the real me.  I had no plan, the thought of somehow becoming public and living my best life was inconceivable with the (perceived) hurdles I had in my way.  

Fast forward to today and I'm fully me since mid Oct when the dam wall broke.  The world hasn't stopped and I'm having a wonderful life, one that I couldn't ever have believed was possible.

Looking back the catalyst was a change in legislation where I live (Australia) which allowed a legal name change in an incredibly straight forward way.  Historically the system was draconian and talked of 'surgeries' and doctors letters.  Now I had to submit some forms and then less than two weeks later the new name and gender marker was real.  This happened in mid Aug.  I then updated every ID form including bank and car license details which, again, was ridiculously straight forward.  The only outstanding doc now is my passport due to flights being booked in my old name.  That will get updated in Feb 25.

At this point I was living two lives and finally bit the bullet at the beginning of Oct.  The week before it was due to be announced where I work (two different companies), I had conversations with about 25 people who I've known and, in many cases, worked with for up to 20yrs.  Every single conversation was incredibly understanding and supportive - in most cases these are senior level execs.  What was also interesting was the number of times I came across people who directly or indirectly knew of other transgender people.

I don't have a big friendship network but I do have a group of people who I see most mornings for coffee before work.  These people would be in that 50-78yr old age category, both cis male and cis female - and without exception, everyone took it in their stride.  Some were inquisitive but I'm absolutely fine with that as I would be the first transgender person they knew. To me this has completely destroyed the myth that the older generation should be given some form of special leeway because 'their generation wouldn't understand' what was going on.  I have an 89yr aunt who when I messaged her on my name change and plans sent through the most amazing note congratulating and supporting me.

So the day it was announced

\- I flew interstate for a conference as me (first time out in public, no going back!)

\- Sat on an industry panel with 5 other panelists answering questions

\- Attended a dinner with an investment bank

\- Update my LinkedIn profile including an updated photo a week or so later - lots of unexpected hits on that!

I was as nervous as anything but the key reminder from my SO in my head was that this was all my work world, to focus on that and not to think about female me and what others might think.

Since then as me I've

\- attended Board meetings

\- had a large number of external business meetings

\- traveled interstate a lot

\- traveled to Europe and had business meetings there with no problem.  My only challenge has been traveling on my old passport and getting pulled up 3-4x with 'excuse me ma'am, this isn't your passport' from customs :).  I do now have to pay the transgender tax because I won't fly through the middle east for safety reasons and flights via Singapore or Hong Kong are always higher.

\- and just lived as me, everywhere. I've worked out it's definitely all or nothing.

To date, I haven't had a single bad experience.  I'm sure that will happen at some point but what I do know is that there are some absolutely wonderful people out there who have my back.

I know it's incredibly hard for some people and I'll reiterate, this is my experience and I'm sure it wouldn't be everyone's. But hopefully it does show that it can work out,",3,1735450369.0,TransLater,0,1.0,False

Hydration and Its Impact on Physical and Mental Health
------------------------------------------------------

Water is essential for life, shaping our physical and mental well-being. Understanding how hydration directly impacts your health can lead to better lifestyle choices. Every cell in your body relies on water to function properly, making it crucial to drink enough throughout the day.

When you stay hydrated, your body can regulate its temperature more effectively. Water helps sweat, which is how your body cools itself down during physical activity. This is vital whether you're working out at the gym, playing sports, or simply enjoying a sunny day outside. Dehydration, on the other hand, can lead to overheating, fatigue, and even dizziness.

Furthermore, adequate hydration is linked to better physical performance. Whether you're an athlete or someone who occasionally exercises, drinking enough water can help you maintain stamina and reduce the risk of injury. Proper hydration keeps your joints lubricated, allowing for smoother movement and less discomfort during workouts.

On a mental level, hydration plays an equally important role. Studies have shown that even mild dehydration can affect your mood and cognitive functions. You might feel irritable, unfocused, or fatigued. Drinking enough water can help improve your mental clarity and keep your spirits high throughout the day. Don‚Äôt overlook how hydration can impact your concentration, memory, and overall mood.

Recognizing Signs of Dehydration and When to Increase Water Consumption
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is vital for maintaining good health. When you don't drink enough water, your body may start showing signs of dehydration. Recognizing these signs early is essential for taking action and adjusting your water intake accordingly. This way, you can maintain optimal health and energy levels throughout your day.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Dehydration can occur for various reasons. Factors such as hot weather, vigorous exercise, illnesses like fever, or even simply forgetting to drink water can lead to a reduction in your body‚Äôs fluid. Here are some common signs that you may need to increase your water consumption:

### Common Signs of Dehydration

- **Thirst:** This is the body's way of signaling that you need more fluids. If you're feeling thirsty, it's a sign that your body is already a bit dehydrated and needs water.
- **Dark Yellow Urine:** If your urine is dark yellow or amber, it likely means you are not drinking enough water. Ideally, urine should be light yellow or clear.
- **Fatigue:** A lack of hydration can lead to fatigue and a general feeling of tiredness. If you‚Äôre feeling unusually sluggish, you may need to drink more water.
- **Dizziness:** This can occur when your body doesn‚Äôt have enough fluids, which can affect your blood pressure and make you feel lightheaded.
- **Dry Skin:** Your skin is composed of cells that need hydration. If it feels dry or looks flaky, this could indicate you need to boost your water intake.
- **Headaches:** Dehydration can sometimes cause headaches or migraines. If you find yourself with a persistent headache, drinking water might help alleviate that pain.
- **Infrequent Urination:** If you're not urinating often, or if the quantity is small, it‚Äôs a clear sign you should drink more.

Besides these symptoms, certain conditions and activities make it crucial to increase your water intake:

### When to Increase Your Water Consumption

Understanding when to drink more water can help you sustain energy and prevent dehydration. Here are some situations where you should consider increasing your fluid intake:

- **During Exercise:** If you're engaging in physical activity, especially in hot weather, it's essential to drink water before, during, and after to prevent dehydration.
- **In Hot Weather:** On hot days, you're likely to sweat more, so drinking extra water can help replace the lost fluids.
- **When Feeling Unwell:** If you're feeling sick, especially with a fever, your body loses fluids quickly. Drink more water and consider electrolyte drinks as well.
- **During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding:** Women who are pregnant or nursing have increased hydration needs. Ensure you drink plenty of water for both your health and your baby's.
- **High-Protein or High-Fiber Diet:** If your diet is higher in protein or fiber than usual, drinking more water can help facilitate digestion and reduce strain on your kidneys.

A routine of regular water consumption can significantly impact your overall well-being. A good habit is to drink a glass of water first thing in the morning. Carrying a reusable water bottle can also serve as a reminder to drink throughout the day.

It's important to listen to your body and adjust your water intake based on your needs. Making a conscious effort to drink water not only hydrates your body but also supports various bodily functions, such as digestion and temperature regulation.

Another effective strategy is to set reminders on your phone or use apps designed to track your water intake. This way, you can ensure you‚Äôre staying on top of your hydration goals.

The stranger (assumed to be a contractor or delivery person for a neighbor) saw me going into my car and when I quickly jumped back out to move my trashcan he made that comment.

During my wife‚Äôs pregnancy, I (M31) gained 130lbs in 9+ months, all in my belly‚Äînow stuck with a 67‚Äù gut, looking overdue with quadruplets. Doctors say it‚Äôs the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome they‚Äôve ever seen. ","Over the past 9+ months, I‚Äôve experienced a truly surreal transformation due to an extreme case of Couvade Syndrome, or ‚Äúsympathetic pregnancy.‚Äù I (M31) have gained 130 pounds‚Äîall in my belly‚Äîduring my wife‚Äôs pregnancy, leaving me with a 67-inch waistline and a silhouette that looks more overdue with quadruplets than any standard body type. While I‚Äôve come to terms with the medical side of this condition, one of the most frustrating aspects of my transformation has been figuring out how to dress myself with any sense of style, comfort, or dignity.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/a/1XUx2qQ) are some photos and videos of me before versus me now in the last couple months of this transformation. 

My body has outgrown nearly every piece of clothing I own, and I‚Äôm at a loss for what to wear. Button-up shirts pull so tight that they gape open, and even the largest sizes I‚Äôve tried seem to ride up over my belly whenever I move. Pants are just as difficult‚Äîthey constantly dig into the underside of my belly or refuse to stay up without a belt, which only emphasizes how far my stomach pushes out. Most of the time, I feel like I‚Äôm one wardrobe malfunction away from total embarrassment, and it‚Äôs only added to the already overwhelming stares and comments I get in public.

I‚Äôm hoping this community can offer some guidance on how to dress for my unique proportions. Are there certain brands or cuts that might better accommodate a large, round belly? Should I prioritize oversized fits, stretchy materials, or specific types of tailoring? I‚Äôd also love tips on colors or layering techniques to downplay the size of my belly and create a more balanced look. Any advice on how to make my wardrobe functional, flattering, and comfortable would be incredibly appreciated.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

For context, I‚Äôll include the details of my transformation and condition below. Feel free to AMA if you‚Äôre curious‚Äîthanks so much for your help:

I never thought I‚Äôd be writing this, but after what‚Äôs happened to my body over the past 9+ months, I feel like I‚Äôm living in a surreal medical case study. My wife and I (both 31) are expecting our first children‚Äîtwins!‚Äîand her pregnancy has been going as smoothly as possible. But for me, things took a very bizarre turn. Early in her pregnancy, I began experiencing symptoms of what‚Äôs called Couvade Syndrome, or ‚Äúsympathetic pregnancy,‚Äù where men mimic some of their partner‚Äôs pregnancy symptoms. At first, it was funny‚Äîme complaining about morning nausea and intense cravings while my wife teased me for being dramatic. But as the weeks went on, the symptoms became extreme.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/a/1XUx2qQ) are some photos and videos of me before versus me now in the last couple months of this transformation. 

Within 9+ months, I‚Äôve gained over 130 pounds, and it‚Äôs all gone to my belly.  Doctors have tested me for every possible condition‚ÄîCushing‚Äôs syndrome, hypothyroidism, ascites, insulin resistance, and a laundry list of rare disorders. They ran metabolic panels, hormone tests, and even MRIs to rule out anything that could explain this transformation. Everything came back normal. After countless appointments with endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, and dietitians, the consensus is unanimous: this is the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome they‚Äôve ever seen. My body has gone into a hyper-sympathetic state, mimicking my wife‚Äôs pregnancy so intensely that I now look more pregnant than she does.

Here‚Äôs the wildest part: my belly has grown to an unbelievable 67+ inches in circumference. It‚Äôs perfectly round, heavy, and tight‚Äîso much so that doctors have compared it to an overdue pregnancy with triplets or even quadruplets. I‚Äôve been experiencing cravings, hormonal changes, and even bizarre moments of arousal that have made this entire experience surreal and difficult to process.

The public‚Äôs stares reactions to me have been nothing short of overwhelming. Everywhere I go, people treat me like a walking sideshow attraction. Strangers constantly stop me on the street to ask, ‚ÄúWhen are you due?‚Äù or ‚ÄúAre you having twins‚Äîor is it triplets?‚Äù Sometimes, people assume I‚Äôm joking when I say I‚Äôm not pregnant or assure them that my belly is real, even, and not a costume. One particularly embarrassing encounter happened when a man followed me in his car, yelling ‚ÄúHey, heifer! How‚Äôd you get so huge, fatass!‚Äù and filming me as I struggled to walk. He kept shouting out the window, ‚ÄúWhen are the babies due?‚Äù and even taunted me to run, laughing as I awkwardly waddled down the street. 

Another time, a homeless man trailed me for blocks, loudly asking, ‚ÄúAre you sick? What happened to you? You can still fix this. You look like you‚Äôre about to pop!‚Äù His comments drew stares from others, and the whole experience left me humiliated. Once, at a grocery store, I reached for something on a high shelf, and the movement caused my shirt to ride up, exposing my belly. A woman nearby loudly gasped and asked if I was okay, or pregnant, and when I assured her I wasn‚Äôt pregnant, she looked me up and down in disbelief before walking away, shaking her head.  Thankfully, some guys are entertained or supportive, and say things like ‚ÄúDamn, bro, that‚Äôs the most impressive belly I‚Äôve ever seen. Take care of yourself. That‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù

Our small town caught wind of what was happening to me and even ran a story in the local paper. They did a photo shoot with me and my wife, documenting what they called ‚Äúthe most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome on record.‚Äù The article focused on the medical mystery and included photos of me standing next to my wife, both of us cradling our bellies. At one point, they measured my stomach circumference on camera, which was mortifying. The reporter joked that I looked more overdue than my wife, and the whole experience left me red-faced, especially when people in town started recognizing me from the article and stopping me to ask questions.

Family and friends have been equally baffled. My wife‚Äôs parents were initially concerned and suggested I get immediate medical attention, while my own family didn‚Äôt believe it at first and thought I was exaggerating. Now, it‚Äôs become a mix of humor and genuine concern. Even at work, my coworkers started a playful due date countdown for me, marking it on the office calendar alongside my wife‚Äôs.

Despite the jokes, I feel terrible that my transformation has overshadowed my wife‚Äôs pregnancy. What should have been a time focused on her and the excitement of our twins has turned into a community spectacle about my bizarre condition. She‚Äôs been incredibly supportive and laughs it off, joking that I‚Äôm taking some of the heat off her by becoming the bigger attraction. But I can‚Äôt help feeling guilty‚Äîthis was supposed to be her moment, and instead, I‚Äôm the one everyone‚Äôs talking about.

Meanwhile, I‚Äôve struggled to maintain a sense of normalcy. My shirts don‚Äôt fit anymore, riding up over my belly and exposing the lower half every time I move. I‚Äôve tried buying larger sizes, but even those don‚Äôt last long before I outgrow them. Just the other day, I bent down to tie my shoe at work, and the strain caused a button to pop off my shirt, shooting across the office like a missile. Everyone heard it, and I had to awkwardly laugh it off while turning red. Another time, I stretched to grab something at a 711, and the seam of my shirt tore open right down the side, leaving me scrambling to cover myself. My pants aren‚Äôt any better‚Äîthey‚Äôre so tight under the curve of my gut that I‚Äôve split the seams more times than I care to admit.

At work, I‚Äôm required to wear a uniform‚Äîa button-up shirt, no less‚Äîand squeezing into it has become a nightmare. The buttons pull so tight that I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll pop, and they often do‚Äîsometimes in front of coworkers or even clients, which is humiliating. I‚Äôve started bringing safety pins to hold my shirts together in emergencies, but even those can barely contain the strain. Each week, I‚Äôm outgrowing something else, to the point where I‚Äôm running out of options entirely.

Getting dressed in the morning has become a daily battle. Pulling my pants up under the massive curve of my belly feels like trying to fit into a sausage casing. The waistband digs into me so tightly that it makes my gut stick out even more, exaggerating its size and making me look even more absurdly pregnant. My belt creaks and groans whenever I sit down, and I constantly worry it‚Äôs going to snap. Even sitting in a chair has become a spectacle; I have to ease myself down slowly to avoid bursting buttons or causing the furniture to creak under my weight.

Movement is an entirely different challenge. I can barely bend over to tie my shoes without my belly pressing hard against my thighs, forcing me to hold my breath just to reach the laces. I‚Äôve started wearing slip-ons to avoid the embarrassment. Getting in and out of my car is another ordeal‚Äîit feels like I‚Äôm wedging myself into a tight space, my belly brushing against the steering wheel no matter how far back I push the seat. Walking down the street, my belly bounces and jiggles with every step, drawing stares from passersby. Sometimes, I even catch people filming me.

Everyday tasks that used to be simple now feel monumental, and I‚Äôve stopped pretending I can blend in. Despite my best efforts to maintain normalcy, my transformation has made me impossible to ignore.

Doctors have been fascinated by my condition, describing me as a medical anomaly. They‚Äôve even suggested publishing my case in a medical journal, as they‚Äôve never seen anything like it. While I understand their excitement from a scientific perspective, it‚Äôs hard not to feel like a sideshow. I‚Äôve been poked, prodded, and measured so many times that I‚Äôve lost count.

As for other symptoms/side effects, there‚Äôs a lot more to this experience than just the abdominal growth. Early on, we thought it was kind of adorable how in sync my wife and I were during her pregnancy. I‚Äôd wake up nauseous when she did, I‚Äôd have random cravings, and we joked about how empathetic I was being when I‚Äôd have morning sickness. But as things progressed, it became clear this wasn‚Äôt just harmless sympathy symptoms. My body‚Äôs hormonal changes went into overdrive. Alongside the weight gain, I‚Äôve dealt with intense mood swings, exhaustion, and an unsettling sensitivity to smells. Even little things, like the scent of strong coffee, can send me running for fresh air.  The exhaustion hasn‚Äôt helped with me also not being very active during this time. 

Unlike my wife, I‚Äôm not growing two babies, so everything I eat is turning directly into fat, and unfortunately, it‚Äôs all going straight to my belly. The uncontrollable cravings have been a big part of this. I naturally eat more than her as it is, but the hormonal changes I‚Äôve been experiencing‚Äîlike elevated prolactin and cortisol levels‚Äîhave completely derailed any sense of self-control. It‚Äôs as if my body is craving the transformation itself. There have been times I‚Äôve gone on insane binges, eating until I physically couldn‚Äôt anymore‚Ä¶ Even when I wanted to stop, it felt impossible, I was still hungry, like my body was demanding more fuel to keep growing.

Doctors think my body is in a kind of ‚Äúhyper-storage mode,‚Äù where every calorie is being stored as fat, specifically in my abdomen, almost as if it‚Äôs mimicking a pregnancy. Some specialists believe my fat cells in this area might have become overly sensitive to insulin, leading to the rapid, disproportionate fat accumulation. Others suggest that elevated prolactin levels, typically associated with lactation and maternal behaviors, might be affecting how my body stores fat and retains fluid. Combined with some fluid retention in my belly, it‚Äôs created this bizarre, ballooning effect that feels completely out of my control. It‚Äôs crazy to outgrow a shirt in a matter of a couple weeks. 

One of the more difficult‚Äîand frankly embarrassing‚Äîsymptoms has been this bizarre hormonal arousal.  Sorry if it is TMI to share all of this, but it‚Äôs such a large part of the psychological side effects I‚Äôve been dealing with that it would be hard not to include it. My doctors have explained that the surges of prolactin, cortisol, and other pregnancy-related hormones in my system seem to be ‚Äúconfusing‚Äù my body, tricking it into thinking this transformation is something I‚Äôm meant to desire or enjoy. It‚Äôs almost as though my body is trying to gaslight me into embracing the changes so it can continue expanding. They‚Äôve told me that this is likely part of a feedback loop‚Äîmy body experiences embarrassment or awkwardness from how big I‚Äôve gotten and the trouble I have maneuvering or drawing attention, and that stress triggers a hormonal response that leads to an unexpected surge of arousal. That sensation then clouds my judgment, making me crave situations where I feel even more self-conscious, which leads to choices‚Äîlike overeating or not avoiding tight clothes‚Äîthat exacerbate the growth.

This feedback loop is one of the hardest aspects to navigate. It‚Äôs created a cycle where I feel like I‚Äôm feeding into my own situation, literally and figuratively. The arousal itself feels like my body‚Äôs way of pushing me to keep going, even though I logically don‚Äôt want to get bigger or draw more attention. And yet, I‚Äôve found myself leaning into these situations, almost unconsciously seeking out moments that leave me even more embarrassed or humiliated. It‚Äôs such a strange and difficult headspace to be in because I know it‚Äôs my hormones playing tricks on me, but in the moment, it‚Äôs hard to fight against. The doctors are optimistic that these reactions should subside once my wife gives birth and my hormones stabilize, but until then, I‚Äôm doing my best to stay mindful and not let this cycle get even more out of control.

At the end of the day, I‚Äôm still at a loss. My body feels alien to me, and every day brings new challenges. I‚Äôve started wondering if this condition will reverse after my wife gives birth‚Äîor if this is something I‚Äôll be living with for the rest of my life.",2,1735449084.0,LooksmaxingAdvice,0,1.0,False
1hoot4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hoot4i/i_love_my_gf/,I love my GF,"I recently started my new job which gave me the biggest opportunity to buy a car that was a dream the moment I saw it. It was a 2 week process of buying it because it was from another state. Everyone was supportive of my decision because they knew I was able to do it on my own. I did get the little talk from everyone, if I was sure I wanted the car because it is a little older and is a little used up but they knew I did my research. 


Anyways, the time comes where I sign the documents and its officially my car. I got the car delivered a couple days later. I get my Temp tags and I pick up my girlfriend that same day to take her out to get coffee before I go to work just as a little gesture to be one of my first passengers. A couple minutes pass by after I picked her up, and I notice she went silent. I look over to my girlfriend and I see that she's silently crying. I wanted to pull over but I had no where to go so I hold her hand and start asking her what's wrong. And she starts telling me how she's so proud of me for doing it and working hard to get my car. Because she knew it was a dream and she was just so happy and proud of me to say I was going to buy a dream car, to actually buy my dream car. 

It was just a wholesome moment for me. I didn't expect her to get emotional or anything but I just love her so much for being there through the whole process. But we finish our little evening coffee date and she is still a little emotional but I tell her it's okay, and I wasn't able to do it without having her on my side, and how she's going to be my passenger princess from now on. ((I've been here passenger princess for the past 3 years)) she made me happy and I almost shed a tear too but I had to be there for her first before myself. ",3,1735449051.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1hoon95,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hoon95/we_broke_up_a_year_ago_and_i_still_cant_move_on/,We broke up a year ago and I still can't move on. Today I found out she's in a new relationship and I'm heartbroken.,"We were together for four years. We broke up a year ago, and a few months into remaining friends she decided to block me on everything without warning.

I've been the bigger person every step of the breakup. From helping her move out, to mailing her stuff to her when I came across it, to checking in to see if she's OK. I also have sent her letters expressing my regrets and actions during our relationship.

She took months to return things of mine, insulted me, didn't apologize for anything, including sexting other people during our time together.

I still think about her **multiple times a day**, even though she's got me blocked on everything. Even though I haven't seen her in a year. Even though she still has stuff of mine she refuses to look for. I'm smitten, and haven't been able to meet anyone since her. I've gone on a few coffee dates with people, but it's never amounted to anything.

Tonight I found out she's in a new relationship. I'm devastated. She's truly never coming back to me. She'll be happy with someone else, and I'll continue to sit here rotting and thinking about her.",1,1735448480.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1hoon3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1hoon3r/decor_essentials_for_small_spaces_maximizing/,Decor Essentials for Small Spaces: Maximizing Style and Functionality,"Designing a small space can be a challenge, but with the right decor essentials, you can transform even the tiniest area into a stylish and functional haven. From clever storage solutions to eye-catching accents, the right [home decor items](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration) can help you make the most of every square inch. Whether you‚Äôre looking for [decorative items for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration), a stunning [ceramic big vase](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/ceramic-beige-vase-l), or wondering, ‚ÄúWhere can I find a great [home decor shop near me](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/)?‚Äù‚Äîthis guide has you covered.

# 1. Start with Multi-Functional Furniture

In small spaces, every piece of furniture should serve more than one purpose. Look for:

* **Ottomans with Storage:** Great for storing blankets, magazines, or even board games while doubling as extra seating.
* **Expandable Tables:** A must-have for compact dining or workspaces that can adapt to your needs.
* **Wall-Mounted Shelves:** Free up floor space while providing a place to showcase your **decorative items for the living room** like photo frames, books, or small sculptures.

# 2. Incorporate Decorative Items That Add Height

Adding vertical decor can make a room feel more spacious by drawing the eye upward. Here‚Äôs how:

* A **ceramic big vase** filled with tall branches or dried pampas grass creates a stunning focal point without taking up too much floor space.
* Use tall bookshelves or ladder-style shelving units to display your favorite **home decor items**.
* Hang long curtains close to the ceiling to give the illusion of taller windows and higher ceilings.

# 3. Choose Compact and Versatile Decorative Items

Small spaces call for curated, purposeful decor. Consider these ideas:

* **Decorative Items for Living Room:** Opt for small, eye-catching accents like candle holders, trays, or table sculptures that don‚Äôt overwhelm the space.
* **Mirrors:** A well-placed mirror can make any room feel larger by reflecting light and creating an open feel.
* **Wall Art:** Instead of bulky decor, choose framed prints or a gallery wall to add personality without taking up valuable floor space.

# 4. Maximize Style with Statement Pieces

While small spaces require minimal clutter, a few bold items can elevate the room‚Äôs aesthetic.

* A **ceramic big vase** in a striking color or design can serve as a conversation starter in your living room or entryway.
* A single statement lamp or pendant light can act as both a functional and decorative piece.
* Rugs with bold patterns or textures help define areas in open-plan spaces and make the room feel cohesive.

# 5. Declutter with Stylish Storage Solutions

Clutter can quickly overwhelm a small space. Keep your essentials organized and hidden with stylish storage options:

* Use decorative baskets or bins to store smaller items.
* Trunks or storage benches can hold seasonal items while doubling as seating or coffee tables.
* Built-in shelving or floating shelves provide storage and display space for your **home decor items**.

# 6. Add Greenery and Natural Elements

Plants can breathe life into small spaces without taking up too much room.

* Place small potted plants on shelves, countertops, or coffee tables.
* Use a **ceramic big vase** to display fresh or dried flowers.
* Hang planters or use wall-mounted pots for a touch of greenery without sacrificing floor space.

# 7. Where to Find Home Decor for Small Spaces

If you‚Äôre searching for a **home decor shop near me**, look for stores that specialize in versatile, stylish, and compact designs. Many shops in your area likely offer a range of **home decor items** perfect for small spaces, including vases, mirrors, and compact furniture. Online shopping is also a great option, as you can easily filter by size, style, and function.

# 8. Layer Lighting for Depth

Small spaces often benefit from layered lighting to create depth and ambiance.

* Use floor lamps to brighten dark corners.
* Add string lights or wall sconces for a cozy atmosphere.
* Pair your lighting with reflective surfaces like mirrors or metallic decor to amplify the brightness.

# 9. Personalize with Meaningful Accents

Your decor should reflect your personality, even in a small space. Incorporate:

* **Decorative Items for Living Room:** Showcase items with sentimental value, such as framed photos, travel souvenirs, or handmade crafts.
* **Functional Decor:** Look for pieces like stylish clocks, bookends, or organizers that are both beautiful and practical.

# Final Thoughts

Decorating a small space doesn‚Äôt mean sacrificing style or functionality. With the right mix of thoughtful furniture, bold statement pieces like a **ceramic big vase**, and well-chosen **decorative items for the living room**, you can create a space that feels both spacious and inviting. Start by finding your favorite **home decor items**, and don‚Äôt hesitate to explore local options by searching for a **home decor shop near me** for personalized finds.

1hoomp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/IUEC/comments/1hoomp6/faqs_for_those_looking_to_get_started_and_brand/,FAQs for those looking to get started and brand new probies,"There is a ton of good info on this subreddit. It‚Äôs easy enough to search each question, but I figured I‚Äôd put all the questions I wanted answered or would‚Äôve wanted answered in one spot. I‚Äôve read a ton of posts on this subreddit over the last year and have accumulated some (hopefully) accurate answers to reoccurring questions. Just for reference I‚Äôm currently 2 months into working as a probie. I'm aware I still know next to nothing, but I do know some about the ""getting started"" bit, and since it's still pretty fresh I figured I'd get it all down. 

Please feel free to add anything I missed or correct anything I screwed up.¬†

**How do you get in?**¬†

Go to¬†[https://www.neieprecruitment.org](https://www.neieprecruitment.org/)¬†and check if your local is hiring. If they‚Äôre not, then you can call the hall and see when they are likely to open up applications. Typically, it‚Äôs every 2 years. If they just finished a hiring cycle, it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôll be waiting a good 2 years to even apply. You can also check¬†[https://www.neiep.org/elevator-apprenticeship-recruitment-opportunities/](https://www.neiep.org/elevator-apprenticeship-recruitment-opportunities/)¬†

Keep in mind some application windows fill up fast. There are a limited amount of applications they'll take so I recommend being ready to apply the morning that the application window opens up. 

**Military/Veteran?**

If you‚Äôre currently in the military or a veteran, look up helmets to hardhats. They can potentially get you on a hiring list even if there isn‚Äôt an open application at the moment.¬†¬†

**What are the steps after applying?**

If your application is accepted then you take the EIAT test. If you pass the test they approve you for an interview. After the interview they combine your interview score, test score, and any extra points from certifications you have. I‚Äôve heard/been told that CPR, OSHA 10 or OSHA 30, Military experience, and college degrees all count as bonus points. Having actual experience in the trades also helps but I‚Äôm not sure if that counts as points towards your ranking.

**How to prepare for the exam?**

The exam is fairly simple; it‚Äôs composed of grammar, math, and mechanical aptitude

Everyone learns differently, but getting a good score on the test matters if you want to rank well. For me it was worth it to pay for some test prep. I used [jobtestprep.com](http://jobtestprep.com) and I felt confident for the test. I recommend it. Also, there are tool knowledge questions on the exam, and they test you on reading a tape measurer.¬†

**What questions do they ask at the interview?**

I wasted time because I prepped for the interview like any other job interview. What are my strengths, weaknesses, why would I be a good fit for the role? Stuff like that. They didn‚Äôt ask any of that. It‚Äôs an interview to make you think on your feet and to see how you‚Äôd react to certain situations and/or what you‚Äôve done in the past. Just try and relax and answer honestly.

**Is there a drug test?**

Yes. Everyone who gets the call gets a drug test. If this career is important to you, give up the weed.¬†

**When will I get the call?**

This is probably the most commonly asked question. The disappointing truth is no one knows. It depends on lots of variables. Typically, big locals will hire more people faster. I‚Äôve read that some small locals will only hire 3-5 people in a 2-year cycle. Some big locals hire hundreds in a cycle. And each 2 year hiring cycle is different. If your local hired roughly 5 people/month last cycle, don‚Äôt bank on that being the same this time. You can tell your employer about your situation if you want to, but a lot of people don‚Äôt. Typically, when you get the call, they want you to start the following Monday, maybe even the very next day. This means quitting your current job on the spot for most people. But this career is highly sought after and most companies can and will replace you pretty quick, so don‚Äôt feel bad about quitting on the spot. One more time, in case it wasn‚Äôt clear enough, no one knows when you‚Äôll get the call. Some locals have an updated number on their website stating where they‚Äôre at on the list. Some locals you can call the hall and they‚Äôll tell you. Some won‚Äôt. But even if you know you‚Äôre next on the list, it could be a week or it could be 10 months until you get the call. It sucks, but don‚Äôt be waiting and anticipating it every day. It‚Äôs gonna be a looooong wait that way.¬†

**How are the pay/benefits?**

They‚Äôre good. Every local is a little different. You start out at making 50% of full mechanic‚Äôs rate which is a pay cut for some people in the beginning, but it's gonna be worth it in the long haul. 

**Should I quit my current job to join the IUEC?**

Obviously, that depends. Do your own research into the elevator trade and see if it interests you enough to make a career switch. There are tons of people trying to get a job as an elevator mechanic, so if you‚Äôre on the fence about it, most people would say just stay where you‚Äôre at and let those who are stoked to get started have their chance. It‚Äôs highly competitive but that doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt try. The only way to guarantee you won't get in is by not applying. ¬†

**Do I need to know somebody to get it?**

Not anymore. From what I‚Äôve read it sounds like nepotism was almost the only way to get in for the longest time. But now it‚Äôs all based on how you rank on the exam and interview.¬†

**How to do well as a probie?**

There‚Äôs a lot of variables here, specifically based on which company hires you and who your mechanic is, but from what I‚Äôve read some things ring true across the field.¬†If you do get the call, don‚Äôt blow it by doing something stupid. 

Always be on time, which means beat your mechanic to the job site by at least 5 minutes. Stay off your phone. Bring a small notepad to write things down. There‚Äôs a ton of info being thrown at you and it‚Äôs easy to forget. Writing things down helps. Always be aware of your surroundings. That means know where all the tools are so when your mechanic asks for something you‚Äôre not scrambling looking around like an idiot for 20 seconds. Try to always be doing something. Sometimes there really is nothing to do except watch what your mechanic is doing so try to soak it in and learn. Be a sponge. Most times though you can prep for whatever task is coming up next or sweep or take out trash. Keeping the work area neat and tidy is huge. If you feel like you‚Äôre genuinely out of things to do, ask your mechanic if there‚Äôs anything you can help with. Don‚Äôt ask stupid questions just for the sake of asking questions. For the most part it‚Äôs better to keep your mouth shut, help when/where you can, and don‚Äôt be an idiot. Also, it‚Äôs not necessary but it‚Äôs nice to buy your mechanic coffee once in a while.¬†¬†

**Can I switch mechanics?**

From what I‚Äôve read, a lot of mechanics can be real dicks, especially to the probies. Stick it out. As a probie, you pretty much have zero pull or say in anything and asking to switch mechanics probably won't go well for ya. Sounds like it can almost be a right of passage to make it through the getting treated like garbage phase of being a probie. Not all mechanics are like that, but if they are then just take it as an opportunity to get thick skin and it‚Äôll make it that much sweeter once you make it through.¬†¬†

**How much traveling is there?**

It‚Äôs gonna depend on your local and where the work is. Just plan to travel a bunch and then if you don‚Äôt have to, that‚Äôll be a nice perk. Some people stay in hotels during the work week if the job site is far enough away and then drive home on the weekends. Some drive 1-3 hours each way every day. It all depends, but you go where the work is.¬†

**What tools do I need?**

I‚Äôm pretty sure each company does things slightly different, but for the most part your mechanic will provide all the tools. I bring a folding ruler, electrical tape, sharpie, notepad, and pen every day. The company and/or mechanic will likely provide the rest and/or tell you what you need. Ask your mechanic what you need when you start.",10,1735448438.0,IUEC,2,1.0,False

I just need to vent/advice because my heart is all over the place.
I just got out of a long-term relationship (was 13 years) to my ex husband. I mourned the relationship long before he broke up with me, as I‚Äôve been wanting to separate for the longest. He finally came to his senses this last September. Long story short, we still ‚Äúlive together‚Äù but he sleeps in a different room and leaves early/ comes home late from work so I hardly see him and have the place mostly to myself. I‚Äôm moving into my new place (by myself) this February.

When we moved to this new city and I started working with my dad at his job, I met someone who worked in the same department with me at the time and we became great friends over the course of the next few years. When my relationship with my ex started to fall apart, I started to grow feelings for said work friend. My ex ended up telling him without telling me and so when I confronted him about it, he started pushing me away and acting weird/differently (the work friend)
Anyway, said work friend moved up in our job and is now considerably my boss, I‚Äôve realized my unrealistic fantasy/feelings over him and we managed to say good friends.

BUT, in the end process of that happening, I moved to a different department as well and started shadowing someone. We became really close, and talk about pretty much everything. Now looking back, I think I was too vulnerably honest and being myself too comfortably, in which I told him a lot of things. He makes me coffee or buys me snacks, or looks for me all the time. He asks me daily how everything is and try‚Äôs to cheer me up when I‚Äôm sad. On Christmas Eve we both worked and I left earlier than him, so he promised to save me some free food and bring it to me somewhere later. He ended up giving me his dad‚Äôs address and I picked up the food. he spontaneously asked me to stay because they were having a Christmas party and wanted me to meet his whole family. 
IT WAS THE BEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE. Not even with my ex of 13 years had I‚Äôve had a night like that.
But it was during the whole night where I felt the shift. Of me starting to look at him differently. And now I‚Äôm looking back and hyper analyzing everything he‚Äôs ever told me, missing the hints or sly remarks.

Fuck.

And now my heart is flipping backwards like a gymnast, because I can‚Äôt help but to find him attractive and love how his brain works. 
He‚Äôs everything I want in a man, but I just can‚Äôt get over how he‚Äôs younger than me (23, im 28) and shorter. But also because he‚Äôs the second guy Ive (semi, I still can‚Äôt decide) had a crush on.
He asked me if I was doing anything for New Year‚Äôs Eve and has apparently planned something for us, and I CANT WAIT.

But whyyyyyyyyyyy, I just can‚Äôt get over why I feel this way.

After moving to the South Seattle area in 2013 and buying some rugs in 2014 at Sears Seattle and Sears Bellevue-Redmond we bought a Shark vaccum at this Sears department store sometime in 2015. 

At the Downtown Seattle location I remember looking for some USB cable for a transfer and migration from Windows XP to the latest operating system in the early 2010s decade when we had plans for an upgrade to Windows 7, 8 and possibly even 8.1, with software called Laplink PCmover Express for Windows XP. We also bought a Kenmore coffee maker here at this Sears. Along with a Hamilton Beach toaster oven at the Sears between Bellevue and Redmond that was shutting down in 2018. 

Back in 2023 and again this year in 2024, this was the very last Sears and Roebuck department store in my home state of Washington that shut down recently. The very first Sears store in Washington, in Downtown Seattle, that shut down back in June 1 2014, opened in 1925.

I do hope someone with retail experience will buy out this truly historic and unique retailer like what happened to a few others that previously closed up shop 

With that being said, as we are at the end of 2024, Sears department store is near its 100th year  (its almost 2025)

We just love it here. It‚Äôs the only other place we‚Äôd move too, but not sure we‚Äôll get the chance before aging parents etc. probably take us back to the UK. Maybe at some point in our future, I‚Äôd love to spend a couple of years here. Not sure what it is, but the vibe, the outdoor spaces, the weather, it really has just captured our hearts. I laugh when I see all the negative comments. We have all these problems in Vancouver, and any other city I‚Äôve visited, but at the end of the day this is a really really beautiful place. I find people more approachable than in Canada, having a dog definitely helps, but more people just seem open to strike up a conversation. 

Any recommendations on last minute things we could do? We‚Äôre staying at a hotel near Marina district, we have our dog so tend to do coffee shops and walks during the day, then leave her in the evening while we do our own thing.

I just need to vent/advice because my heart is all over the place.
I just got out of a long-term relationship (was 13 years) to my ex husband. I mourned the relationship long before he broke up with me, as I‚Äôve been wanting to separate for the longest. He finally came to his senses this last September. Long story short, we still ‚Äúlive together‚Äù but he sleeps in a different room and leaves early/ comes home late from work so I hardly see him and have the place mostly to myself. I‚Äôm moving into my new place (by myself) this February.

When we moved to this new city and I started working with my dad at his job, I met someone who worked in the same department with me at the time and we became great friends over the course of the next few years. When my relationship with my ex started to fall apart, I started to grow feelings for said work friend. My ex ended up telling him without telling me and so when I confronted him about it, he started pushing me away and acting weird/differently (the work friend)
Anyway, said work friend moved up in our job and is now considerably my boss, I‚Äôve realized my unrealistic fantasy/feelings over him and we managed to say good friends.

BUT, in the end process of that happening, I moved to a different department as well and started shadowing someone. We became really close, and talk about pretty much everything. Now looking back, I think I was too vulnerably honest and being myself too comfortably, in which I told him a lot of things. He makes me coffee or buys me snacks, or looks for me all the time. He asks me daily how everything is and try‚Äôs to cheer me up when I‚Äôm sad. On Christmas Eve we both worked and I left earlier than him, so he promised to save me some free food and bring it to me somewhere later. He ended up giving me his dad‚Äôs address and I picked up the food. he spontaneously asked me to stay because they were having a Christmas party and wanted me to meet his whole family. 
IT WAS THE BEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE. Not even with my ex of 13 years had I‚Äôve had a night like that.
But it was during the whole night where I felt the shift. Of me starting to look at him differently. And now I‚Äôm looking back and hyper analyzing everything he‚Äôs ever told me, missing the hints or sly remarks.

Fuck.

And now my heart is flipping backwards like a gymnast, because I can‚Äôt help but to find him attractive and love how his brain works. 
He‚Äôs everything I want in a man, but I just can‚Äôt get over how he‚Äôs younger than me (23, im 28) and shorter. But also because he‚Äôs the second guy Ive (semi, I still can‚Äôt decide) had a crush on.
He asked me if I was doing anything for New Year‚Äôs Eve and has apparently planned something for us, and I CANT WAIT.

But whyyyyyyyyyyy, I just can‚Äôt get over why I feel this way.

I purchased the Dental Pod Pro ultrasonic cleaner just like anybody else would. I thought I‚Äôd give a review because it‚Äôs pricey and I, for one, was really put off by the price at first. I thought others would appreciate an honest review to help decide if the $100-$140 is the right choice for them. 

I originally bought a $30 ultrasonic cleaner off Amazon. It said it had 45,000hz which was higher than the Dental Pod at 42,000hz. I was really put off by the high cost of the Dental Pod even though people had good things to say, I just couldn‚Äôt imagine the extra cost being worth it. I started realizing that brushing my aligners 2x/day was going to be necessary with my Amazon cleaner. I noticed film build up after a few days, in some spots, rather thick. I will say I do drink coffee with my aligners in so I‚Äôm sure that contributes, however, I would notice the build up even after I had cleaned my aligners but not had coffee. This is when I started wondering if the Dental Pod was worth it and dove in. 

I got it today and have been geeking out and definitely noticed a difference! My current aligners were stained after I had some turmeric ginger tea. Two cleanings made a significant difference in removing the staining. The Pro version only differs by having a second, more intense cleaning setting. I‚Äôve tried it with the Dental Pod brand cleaning tabs and my own and both have performed well.

Overall, if the cost of the Dental Pod wouldn‚Äôt put you out, it‚Äôs worth it especially if staining bothers you, you drink things that aren‚Äôt water with your aligners, and/or have a history of gum recession/periodontal disease. I think the base line version would suffice for most. I‚Äôm not sure the additional cleaning cycle on the Pro is worth the extra money, especially since it means having your aligners out for 15 mins. 

TL;DR: the Dental Pod is worth the money if you can swing it. I would suggest the base line version.

During my wife‚Äôs pregnancy, I (M31) gained 130lbs in 9+ months, all in my belly‚Äînow stuck with a 67‚Äù gut, looking overdue with quadruplets. Doctors say it‚Äôs the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome they‚Äôve ever seen. ","Over the past 9+ months, I‚Äôve experienced a truly surreal transformation due to an extreme case of Couvade Syndrome, or ‚Äúsympathetic pregnancy.‚Äù I (M31) have gained 130 pounds‚Äîall in my belly‚Äîduring my wife‚Äôs pregnancy, leaving me with a 67-inch waistline and a silhouette that looks more overdue with quadruplets than any standard body type. While I‚Äôve come to terms with the medical side of this condition, one of the most frustrating aspects of my transformation has been figuring out how to dress myself with any sense of style, comfort, or dignity.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/a/1XUx2qQ) are some photos and videos of me before versus me now in the last couple months of this transformation. 

My body has outgrown nearly every piece of clothing I own, and I‚Äôm at a loss for what to wear. Button-up shirts pull so tight that they gape open, and even the largest sizes I‚Äôve tried seem to ride up over my belly whenever I move. Pants are just as difficult‚Äîthey constantly dig into the underside of my belly or refuse to stay up without a belt, which only emphasizes how far my stomach pushes out. Most of the time, I feel like I‚Äôm one wardrobe malfunction away from total embarrassment, and it‚Äôs only added to the already overwhelming stares and comments I get in public.

I‚Äôm hoping this community can offer some guidance on how to dress for my unique proportions. Are there certain brands or cuts that might better accommodate a large, round belly? Should I prioritize oversized fits, stretchy materials, or specific types of tailoring? I‚Äôd also love tips on colors or layering techniques to downplay the size of my belly and create a more balanced look. Any advice on how to make my wardrobe functional, flattering, and comfortable would be incredibly appreciated.

For context, I‚Äôll include the details of my transformation and condition below. Feel free to AMA if you‚Äôre curious‚Äîthanks so much for your help:

I never thought I‚Äôd be writing this, but after what‚Äôs happened to my body over the past 9+ months, I feel like I‚Äôm living in a surreal medical case study. My wife and I (both 31) are expecting our first children‚Äîtwins!‚Äîand her pregnancy has been going as smoothly as possible. But for me, things took a very bizarre turn. Early in her pregnancy, I began experiencing symptoms of what‚Äôs called Couvade Syndrome, or ‚Äúsympathetic pregnancy,‚Äù where men mimic some of their partner‚Äôs pregnancy symptoms. At first, it was funny‚Äîme complaining about morning nausea and intense cravings while my wife teased me for being dramatic. But as the weeks went on, the symptoms became extreme.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/a/1XUx2qQ) are some photos and videos of me before versus me now in the last couple months of this transformation. 

Within 9+ months, I‚Äôve gained over 130 pounds, and it‚Äôs all gone to my belly.  Doctors have tested me for every possible condition‚ÄîCushing‚Äôs syndrome, hypothyroidism, ascites, insulin resistance, and a laundry list of rare disorders. They ran metabolic panels, hormone tests, and even MRIs to rule out anything that could explain this transformation. Everything came back normal. After countless appointments with endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, and dietitians, the consensus is unanimous: this is the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome they‚Äôve ever seen. My body has gone into a hyper-sympathetic state, mimicking my wife‚Äôs pregnancy so intensely that I now look more pregnant than she does.

Here‚Äôs the wildest part: my belly has grown to an unbelievable 67+ inches in circumference. It‚Äôs perfectly round, heavy, and tight‚Äîso much so that doctors have compared it to an overdue pregnancy with triplets or even quadruplets. I‚Äôve been experiencing cravings, hormonal changes, and even bizarre moments of arousal that have made this entire experience surreal and difficult to process.

The public‚Äôs stares reactions to me have been nothing short of overwhelming. Everywhere I go, people treat me like a walking sideshow attraction. Strangers constantly stop me on the street to ask, ‚ÄúWhen are you due?‚Äù or ‚ÄúAre you having twins‚Äîor is it triplets?‚Äù Sometimes, people assume I‚Äôm joking when I say I‚Äôm not pregnant or assure them that my belly is real, even, and not a costume. One particularly embarrassing encounter happened when a man followed me in his car, yelling ‚ÄúHey, heifer! How‚Äôd you get so huge, fatass!‚Äù and filming me as I struggled to walk. He kept shouting out the window, ‚ÄúWhen are the babies due?‚Äù and even taunted me to run, laughing as I awkwardly waddled down the street. 

Another time, a homeless man trailed me for blocks, loudly asking, ‚ÄúAre you sick? What happened to you? You can still fix this. You look like you‚Äôre about to pop!‚Äù His comments drew stares from others, and the whole experience left me humiliated. Once, at a grocery store, I reached for something on a high shelf, and the movement caused my shirt to ride up, exposing my belly. A woman nearby loudly gasped and asked if I was okay, or pregnant, and when I assured her I wasn‚Äôt pregnant, she looked me up and down in disbelief before walking away, shaking her head.  Thankfully, some guys are entertained or supportive, and say things like ‚ÄúDamn, bro, that‚Äôs the most impressive belly I‚Äôve ever seen. Take care of yourself. That‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù

Our small town caught wind of what was happening to me and even ran a story in the local paper. They did a photo shoot with me and my wife, documenting what they called ‚Äúthe most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome on record.‚Äù The article focused on the medical mystery and included photos of me standing next to my wife, both of us cradling our bellies. At one point, they measured my stomach circumference on camera, which was mortifying. The reporter joked that I looked more overdue than my wife, and the whole experience left me red-faced, especially when people in town started recognizing me from the article and stopping me to ask questions.

Family and friends have been equally baffled. My wife‚Äôs parents were initially concerned and suggested I get immediate medical attention, while my own family didn‚Äôt believe it at first and thought I was exaggerating. Now, it‚Äôs become a mix of humor and genuine concern. Even at work, my coworkers started a playful due date countdown for me, marking it on the office calendar alongside my wife‚Äôs.

Despite the jokes, I feel terrible that my transformation has overshadowed my wife‚Äôs pregnancy. What should have been a time focused on her and the excitement of our twins has turned into a community spectacle about my bizarre condition. She‚Äôs been incredibly supportive and laughs it off, joking that I‚Äôm taking some of the heat off her by becoming the bigger attraction. But I can‚Äôt help feeling guilty‚Äîthis was supposed to be her moment, and instead, I‚Äôm the one everyone‚Äôs talking about.

Meanwhile, I‚Äôve struggled to maintain a sense of normalcy. My shirts don‚Äôt fit anymore, riding up over my belly and exposing the lower half every time I move. I‚Äôve tried buying larger sizes, but even those don‚Äôt last long before I outgrow them. Just the other day, I bent down to tie my shoe at work, and the strain caused a button to pop off my shirt, shooting across the office like a missile. Everyone heard it, and I had to awkwardly laugh it off while turning red. Another time, I stretched to grab something at a 711, and the seam of my shirt tore open right down the side, leaving me scrambling to cover myself. My pants aren‚Äôt any better‚Äîthey‚Äôre so tight under the curve of my gut that I‚Äôve split the seams more times than I care to admit.

At work, I‚Äôm required to wear a uniform‚Äîa button-up shirt, no less‚Äîand squeezing into it has become a nightmare. The buttons pull so tight that I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll pop, and they often do‚Äîsometimes in front of coworkers or even clients, which is humiliating. I‚Äôve started bringing safety pins to hold my shirts together in emergencies, but even those can barely contain the strain. Each week, I‚Äôm outgrowing something else, to the point where I‚Äôm running out of options entirely.

Getting dressed in the morning has become a daily battle. Pulling my pants up under the massive curve of my belly feels like trying to fit into a sausage casing. The waistband digs into me so tightly that it makes my gut stick out even more, exaggerating its size and making me look even more absurdly pregnant. My belt creaks and groans whenever I sit down, and I constantly worry it‚Äôs going to snap. Even sitting in a chair has become a spectacle; I have to ease myself down slowly to avoid bursting buttons or causing the furniture to creak under my weight.

Movement is an entirely different challenge. I can barely bend over to tie my shoes without my belly pressing hard against my thighs, forcing me to hold my breath just to reach the laces. I‚Äôve started wearing slip-ons to avoid the embarrassment. Getting in and out of my car is another ordeal‚Äîit feels like I‚Äôm wedging myself into a tight space, my belly brushing against the steering wheel no matter how far back I push the seat. Walking down the street, my belly bounces and jiggles with every step, drawing stares from passersby. Sometimes, I even catch people filming me.

Everyday tasks that used to be simple now feel monumental, and I‚Äôve stopped pretending I can blend in. Despite my best efforts to maintain normalcy, my transformation has made me impossible to ignore.

Doctors have been fascinated by my condition, describing me as a medical anomaly. They‚Äôve even suggested publishing my case in a medical journal, as they‚Äôve never seen anything like it. While I understand their excitement from a scientific perspective, it‚Äôs hard not to feel like a sideshow. I‚Äôve been poked, prodded, and measured so many times that I‚Äôve lost count.

As for other symptoms/side effects, there‚Äôs a lot more to this experience than just the abdominal growth. Early on, we thought it was kind of adorable how in sync my wife and I were during her pregnancy. I‚Äôd wake up nauseous when she did, I‚Äôd have random cravings, and we joked about how empathetic I was being when I‚Äôd have morning sickness. But as things progressed, it became clear this wasn‚Äôt just harmless sympathy symptoms. My body‚Äôs hormonal changes went into overdrive. Alongside the weight gain, I‚Äôve dealt with intense mood swings, exhaustion, and an unsettling sensitivity to smells. Even little things, like the scent of strong coffee, can send me running for fresh air.  The exhaustion hasn‚Äôt helped with me also not being very active during this time. 

Unlike my wife, I‚Äôm not growing two babies, so everything I eat is turning directly into fat, and unfortunately, it‚Äôs all going straight to my belly. The uncontrollable cravings have been a big part of this. I naturally eat more than her as it is, but the hormonal changes I‚Äôve been experiencing‚Äîlike elevated prolactin and cortisol levels‚Äîhave completely derailed any sense of self-control. It‚Äôs as if my body is craving the transformation itself. There have been times I‚Äôve gone on insane binges, eating until I physically couldn‚Äôt anymore‚Ä¶ Even when I wanted to stop, it felt impossible, I was still hungry, like my body was demanding more fuel to keep growing.

Doctors think my body is in a kind of ‚Äúhyper-storage mode,‚Äù where every calorie is being stored as fat, specifically in my abdomen, almost as if it‚Äôs mimicking a pregnancy. Some specialists believe my fat cells in this area might have become overly sensitive to insulin, leading to the rapid, disproportionate fat accumulation. Others suggest that elevated prolactin levels, typically associated with lactation and maternal behaviors, might be affecting how my body stores fat and retains fluid. Combined with some fluid retention in my belly, it‚Äôs created this bizarre, ballooning effect that feels completely out of my control. It‚Äôs crazy to outgrow a shirt in a matter of a couple weeks. 

One of the more difficult‚Äîand frankly embarrassing‚Äîsymptoms has been this bizarre hormonal arousal.  Sorry if it is TMI to share all of this, but it‚Äôs such a large part of the psychological side effects I‚Äôve been dealing with that it would be hard not to include it. My doctors have explained that the surges of prolactin, cortisol, and other pregnancy-related hormones in my system seem to be ‚Äúconfusing‚Äù my body, tricking it into thinking this transformation is something I‚Äôm meant to desire or enjoy. It‚Äôs almost as though my body is trying to gaslight me into embracing the changes so it can continue expanding. They‚Äôve told me that this is likely part of a feedback loop‚Äîmy body experiences embarrassment or awkwardness from how big I‚Äôve gotten and the trouble I have maneuvering or drawing attention, and that stress triggers a hormonal response that leads to an unexpected surge of arousal. That sensation then clouds my judgment, making me crave situations where I feel even more self-conscious, which leads to choices‚Äîlike overeating or not avoiding tight clothes‚Äîthat exacerbate the growth.

This feedback loop is one of the hardest aspects to navigate. It‚Äôs created a cycle where I feel like I‚Äôm feeding into my own situation, literally and figuratively. The arousal itself feels like my body‚Äôs way of pushing me to keep going, even though I logically don‚Äôt want to get bigger or draw more attention. And yet, I‚Äôve found myself leaning into these situations, almost unconsciously seeking out moments that leave me even more embarrassed or humiliated. It‚Äôs such a strange and difficult headspace to be in because I know it‚Äôs my hormones playing tricks on me, but in the moment, it‚Äôs hard to fight against. The doctors are optimistic that these reactions should subside once my wife gives birth and my hormones stabilize, but until then, I‚Äôm doing my best to stay mindful and not let this cycle get even more out of control.

At the end of the day, I‚Äôm still at a loss. My body feels alien to me, and every day brings new challenges. I‚Äôve started wondering if this condition will reverse after my wife gives birth‚Äîor if this is something I‚Äôll be living with for the rest of my life.",1,1735446539.0,DadAdvice,1,1.0,False

It started with small things and has now escalated to outright taking my belongings. I‚Äôm writing this not just to vent but also to get advice because confronting her has been so frustrating and unproductive.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happened so far:

1. Coffee Pods: I had been saving stronger coffee pods for finals season, but when I went to get them, they were gone. We don‚Äôt share cabinets, and I later noticed her drinking coffee even though she doesn‚Äôt own any pods herself. I started counting my pods and confirmed she was taking them. Only after this did she finally buy her own.

2. Tuna Incident: I noticed my tuna was missing from the pantry. It wasn‚Äôt my other housemate because she has her own, and when I confronted the housemate in question, she denied it outright. I let it go to avoid more conflict, but I felt so disrespected.

3. My Missing Skirt: This was the breaking point for me. I was packing for the holidays and couldn‚Äôt find a black skirt I know I left in my room. After turning my room upside down and asking around, I decided to check her closet, and there it was‚Äîright there. We don‚Äôt share bedrooms, laundry, or storage, so the only way it ended up there was if she took it.

When I confronted her via text, she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just as surprised as you are to find that in my closet.‚Äù We sat down the next day, and while she apologized for ‚Äúeverything,‚Äù she still denied taking my skirt, insisting she‚Äôd never go into my room.

I feel stuck. She lies so easily, and it‚Äôs impossible to have an honest conversation with her. I want to believe people can change, but this behavior is beyond frustrating. I‚Äôve started locking up my stuff, but I hate that I have to live this way.

Has anyone else dealt with a housemate like this? How did you handle it? Would it be worth addressing this publicly or involving a landlord/or even the school? We‚Äôre NYU grads and it sucks that I have to deal with this when I just want to focus on my studies as well. I just feel so disrespected and defeated.

1honxmr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1honxmr,"This $3.99 CyberPowerPC Nohi 01 backlit keyboard, before and after cleaning","Went looking for a Dell stock keyboard and mouse for a Dell system I‚Äôm gifting to a friend as their first PC.

I instead got a $3.99 backlit CyberPowerPC keyboard and a $1.99 T-Dagger mouse (pretty sure it‚Äôs new). 

Unfortunately, tho, the keyboard was fairly used and had a lot of crud buildup caught in the backlight diffuser, so a full teardown and scrub-down was in order. Luckily, no evidence of liquid spills, just plenty of dust and crumbs.

The external housing as well as the backlight diffuser were washed with hot water, Dawn dish soap and a Brillo scrub brush. 

The PBT key caps were placed in a Gatorade bottle along with Comet Cleaner with Bleach and hot water, then shaken vigorously, left to sit, then shaken again on loop for nearly 30 minutes before a hot water rinse, a second hot agitation, then a cold water rinse. 

After sufficient time to dry, the keyboard was reassembled and fully functional. 

I‚Äôve only spent $42 on the entire system; the tower was pulled from a dumpster and similarly disassembled, hand-scrubbed and reassembled. It‚Äôs 4 years old but doesn‚Äôt have a speck of dust on (or in) it now.
