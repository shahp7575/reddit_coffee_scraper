Heck apparently they even sold physical printed copies of this stuff in the form of coffee table books! 🤦‍♂️🤣

You can't make this shit up! (per Teddy's latest video, metioned at the start: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNZwdnBu7E8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNZwdnBu7E8))

The funny thing is these guys have worked across multiple publications in the watch industry and are supposed to be considered professionals.

They're given a red carpet treatment from brands, and are provided with exclusive previews for watches. All for what? So they can accurately report on the watches they cover in a professional manner. Hence they get to call themselves ""watch journalists/experts"".

But all it takes is a simple running of such a publication through ChatGPT to uncover spelling errors & factual inaccuracies.

Hopefully Team Teddy sees this and takes their editorial stuff more seriously.",1,1765217850.0,WatchesCirclejerk,0,1.0,False

1phjsd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1phjsd4/am_i_finally_getting_the_hang_of_my_behmor/,Am I finally getting the hang of my Behmor?,"Hey all, I have had a Behmor 2000ab for about 3 years now, and have mostly winged it until recently. I noticed previously my roasts never really developed an aroma so I wanted to learn how to improve. I've also accepted the fact that roasting 1lb on the Behmor is just not very practical.

So, I've started following close to these parameters (below) for roasting 1/2 lb (227g) and my results seem to be improving - I'm consistently getting a better rolling FC and my beans now have a real coffee aroma to them.

For a Honduran extended fermentation natural (elev 1600 masl) I did the following:

My beans continued to crack while I removed them until I started to cool manually. They already started to smell great just about an hour later, which I'd never encountered before. I brew espresso only so I'll wait a few days before actually tasting, which I know is the most important part of this process. I was aiming for a medium roast and the bean color seems on point for that. I do see some tipping on about 1/2 of the beans.

But, generally speaking, I'm wondering if this approach seems sound to you all. Having a young child and a full-time job with weird hours makes it hard to get my head fully into the details, but I'm trying to learn where and when I can.

Let me know if there are any other details I should share to help evaluate this.

1phjs17,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1phjs17/22f_with_22m_ex_of_15_years_im_emotionally/,22F with 22M ex of 1.5 years. I’m emotionally destroyed after everything he put me through and need advice on how to heal and move forward.,"Before we ever got involved, he had been with a girl in 1st year. She was decent and wanted marriage; he filled that time with “young and free” behaviour, gave her hope but never actually committed. He had two friends — one of those friends was involved in drinking with a girl at a concert and trying to take her to an Airbnb.

Fast forward to 2nd year: he started texting me at the start of the year. I didn’t know the dynamics between him and that other girl. I only knew he hadn’t been roaming around her for a while and they weren’t together, and I wasn’t initially interested, so I would reply to his texts. But he did everything to engage me — asked me to hang out with his friend group, updated me about his day, took me out for ice cream, invited me to libraries to study and then take chai/ice cream afterwards. This went on for about 4 months. I would notice how the first girl he was involved with would stare at me with deep concerns and would look at me whenever I crossed her path but thought maybe im overthinking. I thought he might be serious. I ignored small red flags like him staring at my thighs, a first-time sexy compliment over text (“your lips are so sexy”), and his friend who made a girl drink.

He portrayed himself as honest — one time he told me he needed to “see a female family friend” because her AC didn’t work in her college dorms, and I thought that was so honest of him. In June he gifted me books and took me to coffee during my exams.

In late August I finally said yes when he asked me out. But he often seemed lost in thought; when I asked, he’d say he was tired.

He emphasized staying in Airbnbs and hotels — “we should stay at a really good and vibey place.” That’s when things started to unravel.

I learned how his big brother invites girls to his apartment. He immediately started taking me to vibey places and buying expensive food. He spent most time with me, but I never felt good inside — something felt wrong.

He would play a girl’s playlist on Spotify. I noticed a girl was his #1 best friend on Snapchat. When I asked, he said she was a family friend — the same “family friend” excuse he used for many girls. Later I saw him texting her on iMessage; when I tried to open his phone he got defensive and deleted messages. He removed her, added her again, fought about it a hundred times, and finally removed her after many fights.

Then I saw him liking an entire girl’s Instagram feed — she was from our class. I asked him not to do it; he called her a “model” and I slapped him. He had wandering eyes — we went to a coffee place and he stared at a model until I called it out. He said I always ruin moods and want to fight. I think he went back to try to get her number.

We fought a lot because he’d randomly say he wanted to switch routines and add junior girls on social apps. He claimed he tried to fix issues by involving his friends and asking for their advice.

I cried all the time. One month before my proffs I asked the girl he’d been with last year about their dynamic. She told me he randomly dropped her for no reason and that was the exact time he started talking to me. She said he texted her on and off saying he missed her, then acted happy, tried to make her jealous by roaming with me, and sat around her in class to keep attachments. When me and him started dating, 3–4 months later he messaged her saying he missed her and didn’t want awkwardness — she told him she didn’t care and was with someone who treated her better. I broke down because I trusted him; she sent me proof of messages.

Back in April/May when we studied together, someone would text/call him repeatedly — I saw a notification from that same girl on his Apple Watch and he left saying “wait I’m coming” and came back.

During proffs, our relationship fell apart with trust issues. I checked his phone a lot. One time I found he’d added junior girls on a spam account. He added everyone from quick add and lied saying they were his brother’s friends. He also added a girl who once told him she liked him. I suspected he was interested in the new batch. I still stayed because of physical and emotional connection.

My grades tanked; he got perfect scores (I later found out he bought the exams). After exams we had vacations — he went to Lahore and disappeared for two days, going to lunches/dinners and not picking calls. I blocked him for 6 days. He texted everywhere saying he didn’t want to lose me, so we got back together.

3rd year began and his image in our batch got worse. I managed to get him into my clinical group. At first it felt like progress, but then he started staring at juniors in front of me, adding every junior, ignoring me in the clinical group, acting like he was single, and also tried to talk to this one girl while staring at her body in OT. He ignored me, called his behavior “professional,” denied everything, then tried to be intimate with me and called it fixing things.

This continued. I found his Twitter where he tweeted about loving Kylie Jenner and other disrespectful things. He told me he didn’t care anymore and acted cold and distant.

My mental health and self-esteem collapsed. I got angry and went violent because I felt violated. I screamed, yelled, went crazy, and came to his place via Uber to find answers. He would refuse to communicate with me whenever I would bring a thing that bothered me, he would just cut the call on my face and shake me to the core. He took every advantage of me being very very attached to him both physically and mentally.

He broke up with me. I tried to move on and hung out with new people. He saw a snap of me out and stood outside my hostel, acted violently, called me a slut in front of college, hit me, tried to snatch my phone, and accused me of cheating publicly. I was humiliated and the new guy left thinking I’d cheated cause he texted him saying im a chronic cheater and told him lies. But most people took my side and isolated him.

In June he called, apologized, felt guilty, and said he wanted a fresh start. I listened and in July we started again.

When we restarted in July he hid our relationship publicly because he said I’d humiliated him. He hid me from friends and it didn’t feel right. In August I saw him liking the same girl’s LinkedIn post (the one who had been interested in him). He liked thousands of girls’ posts; he hid his likes and told me to “stop” when I confronted him.

I started getting crazy. He put in zero effort, never spent time or money on the relationship, and blamed me for supposedly planning something against him. September–October were awful. Then in November he suddenly promised to take me out every weekend. I was shocked cause he was the same man who refused to take me out saying he’s studying and focusing on career and it’s a crucial time of his life and I would say there are a lot of couples who are studying in med school so what is his issue? He would just make excuses and excuses. But all of a sudden he now had time every weekend for me — he actually took me out twice before I had to go home to study. On November 20th I was with my clinical group; he called wanting to see me. When I went to see him he accused me of being with a guy. I was with my whole clinical group. I screamed and slammed things in his car for 30 minutes, blocked him, and grabbed his collar. He grabbed my hand and showed me his fist saying if a guy grabbed me he’d punch him. I left.

He texted he never wanted to see me again and was done for real this time. He suspected pregnancy for a while and waited for it maybe.

He has done this before too where he brutally left me. One time in September, I rushed to his apartment to fight cause he was being distant and just making me crazy. I needed to find answers. We fought but he said he’ll treat me good now. I got okay. He did all those things to me and I went to bathroom and meanwhile he checked my phone. He couldn’t find anything but he saw I added ONE guy on my Instagram. He was an old college batchmate. I came out of bathroom, he was quite. He dropped me back and didn’t talk throughout the whole time. I kept trying to talk to him that what’s wrong? Isn’t everything okay now? He said yes. I had to go back home the next day. Next morning, he blocked me from everywhere when I was at airport. I reached home, collected myself and called him immediately that why did he do that? He responded that im a slut for adding a guy and that now he will add every single girl I had issues with. He doesn’t wanna be with me anymore and he blocked me brutally. However a few days later he unblocked me, said he lost his uncle so he was emotionally unstable and acted that way. Gained my sympathies.

Fast forward to now He blocked me everywhere, including the spam account. I blocked him too. He immediately added someone else on the spam account and his main followers increased. He went to a batchmate’s wedding, danced and made sure I watched the stories. I didn’t react, so he made another account and texted me calling me a slut, accusing me of being on Bumble (I never made a Bumble). I had my brother tell him to never text me again and I blocked him for good.

Now I’m shattered. My mental health is broken. I can’t study, can’t focus, I sleep all the time out of depression.",1,1765217771.0,relationships_advice,0,1.0,False

My dad is downstairs watching some old movie on his TV, a much nicer and bigger and plasma-er TV than my mom has at home. I’m looking at the spot on the wall in my bedroom. It looks like every other spot on the wall (it’s not skin just yet) but I know it's that one. The wall is entirely bare; well, the whole room is entirely bare except for the mattress on the floor and my duffle bag with a few changes of clothes.

I go downstairs. The living room of the condo is to the right, the kitchen to the left. I go left. As I'm walking back with the big knife, my dad yells, “Hey, you wanna grab dinner at Bo’s tonight?”

“Nah,” I say. “Honestly, I'm full on chicken nuggets.”

“Sounds good,” says my dad. I head up the stairs.

I've been to the other side once before, at the spot in the closet at my mom’s. I didn't stay long, maybe thirty seconds. I couldn't see very far through all the flies. I was there long enough to know that it was very sad, and very scary, and very comfortable. It's warm, and the flies are too loud for you to think and it's really nice to not have to think sometimes.

I have the flyswatter next to me as I start to cut. The blood starts dripping and the flies start swarming out. Then, just as I can see the light on the other side, I get second thoughts. *No, Colin*. This isn't healthy. Nothing good will come of this.

I put down the knife and start swatting flies. Then I go to the upstairs bathroom and grab a roll of paper towels and cleaning spray, then scrub the fly gunk off the walls. Then I go to my dad’s room to grab the vacuum, and start vacuuming up the flies on the carpet.

I go downstairs again.

“Hey, Dad,” I say. He’s sitting on the recliner with a beer and a big bag of chips. He is wearing a variety of shirt known colloquially as a *wifebeater*. “I need to get some fresh air. Might go catch the movie downtown. Can I get a few bucks?”

“For sure,” says my dad. “Take a fiver from my wallet.”

I take a bill from the wallet on the coffee table. At most movie theaters five dollars wouldn't be enough but at the theater in town you can get a ticket, a popcorn, and a pop. I throw on my coat and start my walk towards downtown.

The sting of the icy wind on my face is enough to quiet my thoughts for a while as I stomp along the salty sidewalks through the evening dark.

I feel very sad. I am a loser, and I have no friends, and the only person who ever tried to be my friend I did an aggravated assault on. The reason I don't have any friends is because I'm an asshole, who sucks. I still have not had a tantrum this year, but I am more unhappy than ever. Huh, I guess the wind isn't actually helping that much, is it?

I arrive at the theater. The marquee says the movie that's playing is the new Narnia movie. That's cool, I've actually kind of wanted to see that one, because I read the book when I was a little kid and liked it. It's pretty busy, which is typical. It's a fun thing to do inside on a cold day. I think if I'm watching a movie, I’ll be too busy thinking about what's happening in the movie to think about how much of a friendless loser I am. I buy my ticket and get in line for snacks. I get an orange pop and a small bag of popcorn. Then I find my seat in the theater near the back on the far right side.

The lights go down and the trailers start, but people are still filing into the theater. Two silhouettes obscure the screen in the row ahead of me. I know who they are: Brad and Maya.

They must be on a date. I guess any time a boyfriend and a girlfriend go to see a movie together, it's always a date. He puts his arm over her shoulder, and she slumps her head into his. That's good, because it means she’s lower in my field of view and I won't have to look at her as much as I'm watching the movie.

That's a weird thought. Why would I not want to see her? There is no good reason that I should feel any emotion, positive or negative, about seeing Maya on a date with Brad. Going on dates at the movie theater is a very normal thing for normal teenagers to do. It shouldn't cause me any discomfort. As a matter of fact, it is causing me no discomfort at all.

The movie starts. It opens on a scene of the Blitz of London during World War II. This is good because the screen is dark so I can't see Maya and Brad’s silhouette. No, that's not why it's good, that is a very stupid reason for it to be good, so it must be good because of its stark and dramatic imagery that effectively portrays the violence the Pevensie children endure during wartime. That's a much better reason for it to be good, so that's why it's good.

Then the kids go to the professor’s house and it's really naturally sunlit, and by the time the screen is all white because Lucy’s going to Narnia and there’s snow everywhere, Brad and Maya are making out.

Making out is a kind of kissing where the kissers’ mouths are open instead of pursed, allowing one kisser to insert his or her tongue into the mouth of the second kisser, and vice versa. It is also referred to as “French kissing,” and, in the United Kingdom, “snogging.” Making out is supposed to feel very good, because having somebody licking your teeth and your tongue is apparently very hot and not weird at all.

Making out is a perfectly normal and age-appropriate thing for a teenage boyfriend and his teenage girlfriend to do when they are at a movie, on a date. I do not feel stressed or anxious at all watching Brad and Maya make out, because that would be an absurd thing to feel and I am a very logical person. I am not watching them make out, either, because of how invested I am in this movie.

I am not jealous. It would be ridiculous if I were jealous. I hold no romantic feelings for Maya. She used to be my friend and now she's not, but even back when she was my friend I didn't hold any romantic feelings for her because we were just friends. I have never felt the urge or desire to kiss Maya myself. Therefore, I hold no resentment towards Brad. If I do, that means I'm stupid, and I'm not stupid. I'm smart.

I should just think about the movie instead of the out-making, because I am emotionally invested in the plot of the movie and I have no emotional investment in the kissing. The White Witch is offering Chad Turkish Delight in exchange for selling out his family (I could have sworn that this character’s name was Edmond in the book, not Chad, and I'm very curious as to why this change was made for the film adaptation. They also appear to have aged up the character significantly, which is weird because he looks older than Peter now).

Brad and Maya are still making out. I guess I don't really know how long the average make-out session lasts, but it's been approximately one half-hour and I don't think Brad and Maya’s tongues have left each other's mouths for a moment of that time. 

I am very uncomfortable, and I am frightened. I feel like little worms are crawling underneath my skin. I don't want to be here. I came because I thought the movie would help drown out my thoughts but all my worst thoughts are louder than ever. There is only one logical explanation for why I feel this way: this is a really, really shitty movie.

I'm in a movie and I can't do anything because doing something would be disruptive to everyone else's movie experience. I'm trying not to breathe really hard and fast because if I do that Brad and Maya will hear me but I don't think I'm getting enough air. I also shouldn't move my hands back and forth really fast because people would see me and it would look really weird. I am trapped in my seat and I'm trapped in my static position but if I just focus on the plot of the movie it will all be okay.

Chad’s reunited with his siblings. They've renamed the character that was named Susan in the book “Amaya” (which seems like an awfully modern name for a film which takes places in the 1940s). They're camping before a big battle with the White Witch’s army. Chad sits by the fire with Amaya.

“I love you, sister,” says Chad.

“And I love you, as more than a sister,” says Amaya. They start making out as Aslan nods approvingly. Mr. Tumnus fist-bumps Mrs. Beaver. I was under the impression that one of the primary demographics for this film is children, but it contains significantly more incest than I was expecting.

I don't like it. How long have these siblings been making out? It must be several minutes. They're taking off each other’s clothes now and there's nowhere I can look where tongues are not being inserted into mouths. I have had zero tantrums all year but I'm going to have a tantrum here in this movie theater and it's going to be very embarrassing, and Maya will see it and she's going to hate me even more because I messed up her date.

There's a room in the theater that's soundproof where parents can take a crying child. I just need to get up and go to that room and I can have a tantrum and it won't actually count as a tantrum because no one will see it.

I get up and I'm breathing really hard and fast and every step feels very clumsy like I imagine being drunk feels like. I get out to the lobby and take a few big deep breaths like I've been drowning and just got to the surface, and I go into the soundproof room.  

There’s a lady already in the room with her crying baby, and it will look really weird if I have a tantrum in here because the lady and her baby will see it, but I need to have a tantrum and I don’t think there’s a better place to do it.

You’re a *creep*, Colin Hannigan. You see a girl you used to be friends with kissing a boy and you think she's *yours*.

No no no no no, that's stupid because I have never held any romantic feelings for Maya, the only reason I'm feeling this way is that this movie sucks. I mean, it includes a shockingly graphic incestuous sex scene. Did the Motion Picture Association of America even watch this movie before they assigned it its PG rating?

*Come on*, Colin. You are *such* a bad liar, but you're even more gullible, so you're somehow able to believe your own *stupid bullshit*. You hurt that girl, and you still want her. No, it's even worse than that. You hurt her *because* you want her.

There's screaming, but the screaming is quiet and my thoughts are loud. *Shut up*, thoughts! *Stop thinking*. Stop talking, brain!

“Hey! Stop it! Get out of here!” It's the lady who owns the theater. My hands are moving back and forth and the woman with the crying baby looks really scared and she’s probably scared because my body language is so aggressive.

I need to leave. If I leave, I'm not going to get in trouble.

“Okay, okay, I'm going,” I say. My coat is still on my seat, isn’t it?, but I can't go back in and get it because Brad and Maya will still be making out and the sex scene in the movie is still happening. I need to just leave, in my T-shirt.

I run out onto the street and it's cold, and the cold is so good, and the cold might hurt more than my thoughts, which is good. I push forward towards my dad’s condo. By the time I get there, my skin is mostly blue, but at least I have something else to focus on.

“How was the movie?” says my dad, not looking away from the TV.

“It was pretty good,” I say.

“Narnia, right? The *Pioneer Press* review said it had like, a weird amount of incest in it?”

“Yeah. It was, um, incesty,” I say, and I'm already up the stairs.

The big knife is still lying on the carpet. I don't even think, I just start stabbing at the scarred-over tissue on the wall. Then I climb through, and finally, I'm somewhere that's warm.",1,1765217767.0,redditserials,1,1.0,False

1phjr8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1phjr8s/extreme_manager_ma/,Extreme manager [MA],"Hi all, first I wanna apologize for the long post but I need some help.

So late last year there was some restructuring in my department as to who reports to who. I ended up reporting to someone who has zero experience in having anyone reporting to them. She told me this directly. So i understand that there was going to be a learning curve for her to get a handle on how to be a manager for the first time. But I feel like shes gone a little crazy. There’s been so much in the last year that I may be forgetting some things and might have to add them later on. So first thing is I work in finance. My manager asked me how I deal with invoices/bills that have issues that keep me from being able to process them in the system. Now the reasoning is that the director of finance told us to bring them over to another team member and go through the folder we have for these issue invoices. But I was only able to tell her that I bring them over to another team member before she cut me off saying that I’m giving her excuses. I then went to the director of finance and told them what happened and said that I should keep bringing them over to the other team member as this hadn’t changed and the they would talk to my manager. Fast forward to this September of this year and my manager again questioned what I do with my issue invoices and I told her the same thing. I brought them over to the other team member as I was instructed. She told me that we’ve talked about this before yet I keep doing things my way. I responded say I’m not doing things my way as I mentioned her instructions to the Director of finance after she talked to me about it the first time and they told me to keep bringing it over to the other team member. Since my manager said I was doing things my way it seems like either my manager forgot about the conversation with the Director or they never had the conversation.

Another thing is, we get two 15 paid coffee breaks, for the morning and evening and an in paid 30 minute lunch break. Again the Director of finance said that it was fine that we combine the two 15 minute coffee breaks together to go take a walk as long as we were caught up with our work. So I would do this occasionally when I was caught up. My manager was like this is not allowed according to the policy. Well I never saw anything in our policy saying that we can’t do that and on top of that the director told me it was fine. My manager ended up talking to the Director and my manager needed up saying it’s fine I do that as long as I let her know so she’s not wondering where I am when I’m away from my desk for the 30 minutes. Another thing is I was having tech issues with my company laptop and I was talking to IT about it. And after I finished talking to IT I had a short conversation with them about their weekends and everything. When I got back to my desk with my equipment my manager had sent me an email saying I am to not be having long unnecessary conversations with employees from other departments. I was so pissed by this email that I responded that I do not have long unnecessary conversations with people in other departments. And I also said that I believed this email was prompted by the conversation with IT that I was having over my tech issues as this was the only long conversation I had with in recent weeks/months, and dare I say years as I keep conversations short if they aren’t necessary. I don’t remember her responding back to this specific conversation. I mentioned this to the IT guy I was talking to with my issues and he was so pissed that he almost went to my manager to go tell her off. But thankfully he didn’t. Shortly after this, the scanner I have at my desk needed an update so i called over IT as they need to put in an administrator password for all downloads and updates. For some reason the scanner didn’t want to update so IT had to take my laptop to remove the app for the scanner and redownload and update it which took a while. My manger then sent me an email saying that if I’m having any tech issues I have to tell her. Like what? I didn’t expect this update to take as long as it did so I didn’t say anything. I’m tempted to just tell her about every tech issue even if it’s as simple as needing new batteries for my keyboard or mouse since she wants to be aware of everything. Also during a company wide meeting the CEO of our company said to limit as many meetings as possible as people aren’t able to work as efficiently as possible and people aren’t productive during meetings as some of the meetings could easily be an email. My manager then started sending me weekly meeting invites for an hour long. Did she not remember the CEO saying to limit meetings as staff aren’t as efficient and productive? Also she would send me meeting invites for her to sit next to me in my small cubicle to just watch me work for an hour. Like what? You want to sit next to me for an hour to watch me work instead of doing work yourself? To me that is a perfect example as to what the CEO had said about staff not being productive. She requested meetings to be able to see how long it takes me to complete tasks as she has been handling more than me. Girl I’m getting my work done. If I’m taking too long to do tasks it’s because she refuses to give me more to do. She’s would give me barely anything to do, refusing to give me work and wants me to stay busy for the entire day? The only option was to take my time to complete the work and review it. Again she responded that this was just an excuse to take things easy. Another thing, when we review statements I am to keep track of whether the invoices are ready to be paid, already paid, or pending approval from the person who requested the service. I made a spreadsheet to be able to note Suppliers name, invoice number and the status of it. I was updating this spreadsheet and she then questioned why I was typing so much. I need to type to do my job, so why is she questioning me over how much I type? It’s not my fault this is the way things are supposed to be done. Around this same time she wanted me to update a daily log so she could see what I was working on at what times and roughly how long it would take me to complete each task. So I needed to do extra typing to update this daily log and to update the spreadsheet for statements. Also she would consistently ask me why I do my work the way I would, and I told her it’s the way it was explained to me when I first started and she would respond that it’s all excuses because the way I’m doing things is incorrect. No it’s not an excuse, it’s the truth. I have no previous experience in finance whether it be work experience or schooling. So everything I have learned has been from my current job, which she partially trained me on. So if things aren’t being done correctly she’s partially to blame as she trained me on some of the processes. Now I get im part of the problem to cause I never followed up with anyone to check if I’m doing things right or if the process has changed.

Im sure I’m forgetting something but all this has been stressing my out like crazy because everything I say she takes it as an excuse or as me trying to shift blame. I’m not, I’m just looking at the bigger picture and yes that includes me as I haven’t been checking in with people to make sure I’m staying up to date and understand everything correctly but the team is also included in the bigger picture as they are the ones who trained me how to do everything. All of this has been stressing me out like crazy to the point where I had to start taking antidepressants and anxiety meds. This also cause me to have a gastritis episode where I was out of work for almost 3 weeks. If you don’t know what that is you’re lucky. It’s a condition partially caused by extreme stress and caused me to throw up everything I would eat.

Also, I want to mention that before I started reporting to my manager, she was out on medical leave for about a year so at times seems like there’s some favoritism towards her because she was on medical leave.

What do you all think I should do? Ive been seeing a therapist and I want her to provide a letter to take time off of work so I can relieve some of this anxiety and stress, but with the meds she’s given me I have been doing better and she wants to wait to see how I’ve been doing on the meds and my system for a little longer before giving me any letters. I can’t just quit because the job market is trash right now. Please help me what should I do? Should I bring this to HR?",1,1765217721.0,AskHR,0,1.0,False

I’m using the smart grinder pro and have tried grinding at 12, 9, & 4 and it’s the same 3 bar max. I also switched coffee from Costco Kauai Coffee to a higher quality freshly roasted bag of Olympia Big Truck with no change.

Unfortunately, constantly working cases puts a strain on their relationship and they can't spend a lot of time together because of it. Fuyumi is, of course, upset at that, but is understanding of it. Hawks will sometimes stay up in the living area waaay late into the night working cases: going through criminal files, evidence reports, crime scene footage, etc.

Occasionally, Fuyumi stays up a little to help, providing tea and coffee, helping to go through reports, files, and footage, and in general, providing moral support. Hawks, of course, knows she means well and is only trying to help, but eventually, he'll tell her to go to bed so she doesn't get late for her job in the morning.

Eventually, after any case is closed after plenty of work, he'll come home late and extremely tired. He'll just eat a _very_ light dinner (probably just a few crackers) and will get straight in bed. Fuyumi wants something romantic, but seeing as he's too exhausted for intimacy, she just settles for a brief makeout, like maybe 2-3, maybe 4 minutes tops.

Hawks always feels bad for missing time with her because of work, so the next night, he'll make some dinner. Other times, he'll call the school she teaches at and tell them she's sick, just so he can have her out for the day. Fuyumi is usually angry when he does that but understands his intention, and she always has fun when they go out.

Depending on how they feel after the day, they might take a bath together or share the shower. If they're up for it, they might get some intimacy going in bed, or they'll make out for a while. Or, most times, just being in the same bed is enough, and they'll just make small talk before they sleep.

HC #2: I think Fuyumi hates when he takes her flying (she likes it, but not when it's comes out of nowhere) and hates when he flirts with other girls or flaunts his appearance to them.

HC #3: Fuyumi hates having to clean Hawks' feathers off the bed. Now that he doesn't have his Quirk, she's thankful for that, but she doesn't admit it.

She's also the one who gets out of bed first to make them both breakfast. On work days, she usually showers before breakfast or after she gets back from work. On weekends, she either showers before or after breakfast.

When Hawks is called over to work in the middle of the night, despite somehow feeling his absence when he leaves, she's no less upset when she wakes up to see his side if the bed is empty.

Hawks, being the more romantic of the two, is always quick to drown her in affection. He always hugs her like a giant stuffed teddy, he gives her kisses, and he likes to tickle her.

Hawks is always persistent when it comes to that, and never stops when Fuyumi struggles to escape, because he knows she secretly likes it. Sometimes they end up in certain positions and are unsure about whether to go any further than that. Sometimes they do, but most times they don't. They feel that stuff is better for the evening, not ghe morning.

Hawks never makes breakfast (or lunch or dinner) because he knows he can't compete with her. The only time he ever makes breakfast is when it's a special occasion. Even if he has to leave his meals for a moment, when she goes for her shower, he never misses the chance to ask if he can share the shower with her. Sometimes she tells him no, at the request of having her own privacy, which he respects, but other times she goes sure. He's fallen too far deep for her to come back up again.",1,1765217608.0,BokunoheroFanfiction,0,1.0,False
1phjoov,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1phjoov/i_30f_dont_know_what_to_do_about_finances_in_my/,I 30F don’t know what to do about finances in my 3yr relationship to 43M,"We have been together for three years and seriously started talking about marriage at the beginning of this year but I still don’t feel confident moving forward with that commitment and I feel so guilty about it. I love him but I’m scared. 

A little background… 

Finance is not his thing and that’s ok but some things have happened financially in this relationship that make me question his maturity. We almost broke up a year ago because I found out he lied to me about his taxes. He told me one night he hadn’t paid his taxes in two years and I was like “Ok well why?“ and he explained because his late father was an accountant and always took care of his taxes and it triggered sadness for him because it always reminded him of his dad. I comforted him and said as long as he took care of it now and paid what he owed what does it matter? The next day he actually told me it had been 9yrs and he was afraid of how much he owed or what would happen. He scared the hell out of me with that statement. I literally thought he might go to jail. I think it’s been about 7yrs since his father passed. It was a very rough time for him and his family and he was a caretaker to his father for a little while so I empathize with the trauma that caused and understand the response to a degree. 

When he told me this I said I needed some time to think about everything and I was hurt that he kept this from me in our many conversations about finances. I told him we would take a month (because Im a freelancer and work was INSANE that month I wouldn’t see him that much anyways because of traveling so much) to get his finances in order and go from there.

When we decided to get back together he told me that in getting his taxes in order he realized he actually did pay some taxes over the years and actually got money back..??? which is great but I was most upset about the hiding it from me and the way he explained it to me made me worry he would actually have criminal charges against him.

He also said he didn’t know if he wanted to be with me and I should apologize for not being more understanding. he said he didn’t actually know what I contributed to the relationship. he does all these things for me and he couldn’t think of ways in which I contribute. I broke down in tears and apologized profusely because he was so convincing. He accepted it and said he would never bring it up again.

But now a year later I am rethinking how all that went down. I have always contributed so much to this relationship. It’s wild to me that he even said that. I feel like I’m going crazy though. I could have stayed in the relationship instead of putting a month between us but I was extremely overwhelmed with work at the time and I had to focus on my performance or I was going to fall apart.

fast forward to today…

We are great and things have been good. We were having our daily coffee and I was just talking about expenses because we are planning a trip overseas next year. I mentioned how I needed to figure out my taxes for next year before the year ends because I’m probably going to have to pay a lot more and need to see what I need to save and spend. 

I asked him how his taxes went this year and if he got to them yet and he said he still hasn’t done them and he looked sad so I didn't press. But I was hurt. I have repeatedly communicated how important it is for me to see that he can take care of these things without me worrying about him.

I feel sick to my stomach, because I think I know deep down he's not going to change and if I say yes in marriage to him he’s always going to neglect these responsibilities.

  
There have been other little things too like a few times I would reach for a snack or a drink when we were eating at his place which we do all the time at each others places, and he asked me not to because it was too expensive. I dont ever ask for much. I don’t even ask for him to take me out. It bothered me that he would say that. He apologized later after I explained why but I’m not convinced he understands sometimes. 

He's so wonderful in SO many ways. He’s so caring and kind to me and my family. Am I being too harsh? I wish I was one of those people who was in touch with their intuition but I just don’t feel like I am and I don’t want to talk to my family and friends about this.

1phjmpb,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1phjmpb/dibble_and_the_murder_that_happened_in_no_time/,Dibble and the Murder That Happened in No Time,"I watched the Meridian Dawn's wake fade from the observation deck of Orbital Station Keth-7, my notebook heavy in my coat pocket. The diplomatic vessel had already shifted into hyperspace, leaving behind the familiar violet shimmer.



""Natural causes,"" I murmured, though the words tasted like ash in my mouth. ""Cardiac failure. It happens sometimes.""



Six hours ago, I had been standing in a dead man's cabin, staring at an impossibility wrapped in a data cable. The Vrosh studier lay on his bed, seven feet of alien diplomat with his neck compressed by standard ship equipment. The door had been sealed from the inside, the biometric lock still responding to his palm print. It was a locked-room murder that should have been impossible.



But the impossible became something else entirely when I applied the one law governing every hyperspace transit: time moves differently for humans.



*Six Hours Earlier*



The Meridian Dawn's corridors felt wrong when empty. The human captain ed me through the passenger deck with the careful footsteps of someone carrying a live grenade. Ventilation systems cycled, ambient lighting operated at half-power, the ship's AI processing hummed like a sleeping predator.



""Twenty-seven crew, twelve passengers,"" she explained as we walked. ""The Ytha integration delegation plus various interest groups. Plus Studier Srix, of course.""



""Of course,"" I echoed, but my mind was already cataloging details. The carpet showed no traffic patterns—passengers who had been ""paused"" for six hours wouldn't have moved. Only human crew had walked these halls.



""Studier Srix's cabin is this way,"" Torres stopped at a sealed door. ""We preserved the scene, but..."" She gestured helplessly. ""Detective, none of us understand how anyone could have done this. The security protocols are absolute.""



I studied the biometric panel, its green lights confirming it still accepted the dead alien's palm print. ""When does the lock record as the last access?""""



""Six hours ago. Just before we entered hyperspace.""



""And the passenger manifest shows everyone in their cabins?""



""Checked and double-checked. Twelve passengers, twelve closed doors. The security systems monitored it continuously."" Torres pulled up her tablet. ""Paused consciousness, dreamless state, no memory formation. They left their cabins six hours ago, arrived at their destinations, and went straight to their berths.""



I pressed my palm to the biometric reader. ""Studier Srix? Police.""



The door opened with a soft hiss, revealing the smallest of miracles: a locked-room murder.



Srix lay on his bed, his arms at his sides and his legs properly positioned. A standard data cable, common ship's equipment available in every cabin, was wrapped around his neck. The grip end was twisted upward in a clean, efficient strangulation. The cabinet doors stood open, their contents undisturbed. On the bulkhead, the small security monitor showed no signs of a struggle.



""Pictures first,"" I said automatically, though the scene was already fixed in my mind. The alien Detective was correct; this should have been impossible.



""Detective,"" Torres hovered near the door. ""I've got to ask, with respect. What exactly are you looking for?""



I made a note in my book. Room preserved. Access logged. Lock still responding to victim. Consistent with in-situ death.



""Time stamps on everything,"" I said. ""When did your engineer report to the drive compartment?""



""Miller? He was there six hours before transit, as required. Biometric logging, environmental monitoring, the works. He never left the drive.""



""Human crew locations during the jump?""



Torres consulted her tablet. ""Miller—drive compartment, logged biometrics, environmental monitoring, security camera confirms presence. Martinez—bridge, navigation and life support monitoring, mandatory during hyperspace transit. The steward—galley, food preparation for post-jump meal service.""



""All human.""



""Per Compact law. Non-humans don't experience hyperspace transit the way we do. They enter a kind of suspended animation. We maintain consciousness to monitor the ship's systems.""



I made another note. Three humans. Three solid alibis. Motive unclear.



I examined the data cable more closely. My gloved hands found traces of skin cells, residue, and minute scratches on the grip. ""Is this equipment checked out regularly?""



""Ship's equipment. Serviced every hundred jumps, cleaned, replaced when worn."" Torres paused. ""Why? Does something seem wrong with it?""



I held the cable up to the light. ""It has skin cells on it. Human skin cells.""



Torres went very still. ""That's... that shouldn't be possible.""



""Unless someone handled it recently."" I pocketed the cable in an evidence bag. ""I'd like to speak with your crew. All of them.""



*The Human Crew*



The drive engineer was a short, compact man who looked like he'd been carved from whatever metal made up the Meridian Dawn's drive system. He spoke in precise sentences and only took his eyes off the drive readout when I showed him the data cable.



""That's standard issue,"" he confirmed. ""Every cabin has one. They're identical.""



""This one has human DNA on it.""



He frowned. ""Impossible. The steward services all the cabins. Handles all the equipment. If anyone handled it...""



""The steward?""



""Handles passenger services, cabin maintenance, meal preparation."" He checked his chronometer. ""She'd be in the galley now, prepping dinner.""



I found the steward in the ship's galley, a compact woman with competent hands and a way of moving that suggested she'd done this job for longer than I'd been alive. She was heating a kettle, timing it against a performance she'd apparently memorized.



""Steward. I'm Detective Dibble.""



""About Studier Srix."" She didn't look up from her kettle. ""I figured you'd want to talk to me. The cable, right? We all know about the cable.""



""DNA evidence suggests you handled the murder weapon.""



Her hand paused over the kettle's switch. ""I cleaned his cabin yesterday. Standard service. The data cable was in his cabin. I probably touched it.""



I made a note. Handled victim cabin equipment. DNA contamination likely.



""Yesterday when? What time?""



""0200, 0300 ship time. Morning service, before breakfast."" She finally looked at me. ""Detective, I'm five foot two. Srix was seven and a half feet tall and built like a exoskeleton. How exactly was I supposed to strangle him?""



""A fair point."" I studied her face. The steward had the kind of weathered intelligence that made her seem older than she probably was. ""Where were you during the hyperspace jump?""



""Here. Galley. Preparing dinner for the passengers."" She gestured at a security monitor mounted in the corner. ""Right there. Check the footage if you want.""



I reviewed the footage. The steward appeared at regular intervals throughout the entire six-hour jump. The kettle's position changed only twice: once to heat water, and once to refill. The coffee cup remained in the exact same location, completely undisturbed.



""You got bored?"" I asked.



Her mouth twitched in something that might have been amusement. ""Six hours in a galley, staring at the same four walls. I moved the kettle. I heated it up again. Does that matter?""



""Maybe."" I closed my notebook. ""Thank you. I'll be in touch.""



*The Passenger Manifest*



Torres had assembled all twelve passengers in the common area, a decision that had required more diplomatic delicacy than I cared to imagine. Twelve aliens, all taller than me, all looking at me with the kind of careful neutral expression that meant they were hiding something.



""The Ytha integration delegation,"" Torres introduced, ""representatives Ghen and Ythric. Trade negotiator Dosh with the Talan Consortium. Religious leader Kreh from the Transcendent Order. And various other..."" She struggled for a diplomatic term. ""...interested parties.""



I surveyed the group. There were the two Ytha representatives, heavily muscled, their confident posture hinting at a history of species expansion. The Talan negotiator, Dosh, stood tall and thin, his calculating eyes marking him as one who made trades for a living.



 The Kreh leader bore the meditation tattoo scars of a religious authority on her exposed arms. Several others watched me, each with their own motives, and each with an alibi that should not have been possible.



""Studier Srix was negotiating your integration into the Compact,"" I said. ""What were the terms you were hoping to secure?""



Ghen, the Ytha spokesperson, stepped forward. ""Full membership, equal rights under Compact law, independent trade agreements. Nothing that hadn't been granted to other species.""



""And you were confident he'd secure those terms?""



""Of course."" Ythric, the second Ytha representative, spoke with the same authority. ""Studier Srix was the best negotiator in the Western Alliance. He understood integration better than anyone.""



I made a note. Ytha delegation confident of favorable terms. Motive for murder unclear.



""What about you, Dosh? The Talan Consortium would have trade competition if the Ytha integrated.""



Dosh's eyes narrowed. ""Competition is a fact of trade. Murder is not a business tool.""



""Kreh? Religious conflicts?""



""Different species, different paths to enlightenment. I pray for their souls, not their deaths.""



I nodded politely. ""Where were all of you during the hyperspace transit?""



Ghen spoke for the group. ""We were paused. We experienced nothing. We remember being in our cabins just before transit, and then waking up at our destinations.""



""Total memory gap?""



""None. It was as if no time had passed.""



I made another note. 12 suspects. 12 perfect alibis. Paused consciousness during jump.



""Captain Torres,"" I said, ""I'd like to examine the security footage from the passenger deck before the jump. I assume you record all passenger areas during departure procedures?""



""Of course. It's standard security protocol.""



*The Blackout Period*



The security footage was crisp and clear, timestamped to the minute. I watched it on the ship's primary computer, Torres hovering over my shoulder.



""All passenger areas are monitored,"" she explained. ""Not an invasion of privacy—diplomatic transit safety. We log movement for security purposes.""



I watched the timestamp progress forward. One hour before the jump, two hours before. At T-minus thirty minutes, the first alien passenger appeared on the footage: Ghen, walking down the corridor with the purposeful stride of someone keeping to a schedule.



""He was going to see Studier Srix,"" I observed.



""Normal. Diplomatic pre-flight briefing. All the passengers met with him before departure.""



""Show me.""



The footage showed a pattern over the next thirty minutes. Each passenger visited Studier Srix's cabin. Dosh, the Talan negotiator. The Kreh religious leader. The Ytha representatives. The other diplomats and trade representatives, all arriving on time, all leaving on time.



""They all had meetings with him,"" Torres confirmed. ""Standard diplomatic procedure.""



""And then?""



""And then the jump. All passengers in their cabins, all systems green, we entered hyperspace.""



I watched the last timestamp: Studier Srix's cabin door closing behind the last departing passenger. Six hours later, the door would be opened by a biometric reader keyed to a dead hand.



""Motion sensors didn't record any other movement?""



""None. All passengers remained in their cabins.""



I made one final note. 12 passengers. 12 pre-flight meetings. 6 hours later, victim dead. Impossible.



I spent the next three hours in the ship's computer room, cross-referencing the security footage with the passenger logs, with ship time, with every data point available. The numbers never changed. The pattern never shifted. The evidence was clear and impossible.



The Meridian Dawn made routine hyperspace jumps every day. The mechanics were simple: non-human passengers entered a state of suspended consciousness that felt like an instant to them. Human crew remained alert, monitoring systems, keeping the ship and its passengers alive in the space between spaces.



But I'd learned something that no alien Detective would have considered: When did the murder actually happen?



The corpse showed signs of rigor mortis that suggested death had occurred at least eight hours before the ship's discovery. But the security systems only showed six hours of the jump. That meant either the aliens were lying about their consciousness, or the murder had happened before the jump entirely.



I called a meeting in the common area. All twelve passengers, Torres, and the human crew sat in a rough circle while I opened my notebook.



""Studier Srix was killed thirty minutes before the hyperspace jump began,"" I said without preamble.



Confused murmurs from the passengers. Torres shifted uncomfortably. The human crew looked at each other.



""That's impossible,"" Ghen said. ""We were all in our cabins for the entire journey.""



""Studier Srix was strangled thirty minutes before the jump,"" I continued. ""He was killed by twelve people, working together.""



""We didn't—""



I held up a hand. ""Let me walk you through it.""



I turned to the security monitor Torres had mounted in the corner. ""The passenger security systems log entries, but not exits through the maintenance hatches. Studier Srix's cabin has an emergency maintenance exit that leads to the ship's service ducts.""



""Those hatches don't—""



""They don't log exits, only entries. Normal for emergency systems.""



I stood and began to pace, the way I had in a dozen murder rooms across a dozen star systems. ""Here's what happened. All twelve of you visited Studier Srix for your pre-flight briefing. But it wasn't a briefing—it was a meeting.""



The alien faces remained neutral, but I saw the slight shift in posture, the way eyes moved to confirm something spoken without words.



""You went to his cabin. And you discovered that he was planning to sell the Ytha species into servitude. Not integration—slavery with paperwork. The Compact terms he negotiated would have made you tributaries, not members. Your people would have been workers, not citizens.""



""That's not—""



I ignored the interruption. ""So you decided to prevent it. But you needed it to look like an impossible murder, because the investigation would assume the only people awake during the jump were the human crew.""



I pulled out the data cable. ""This came from Studier Srix's cabin. It has your DNA on it, Ghen. And yours, Ythric. And yours, Dosh. All of you touched it, because you all took turns applying pressure.""



""We never—""



""You took turns. Because he's large, and you needed to coordinate. This wasn't rage—this was planning.""



Torres started to speak, but I held up my hand again.



""You locked the door using his dead hand on the biometric reader. The lock was keyed to his palm print—you placed his hand on the sensor, and the system accepted the access code. Door locked from the inside.""



I gestured toward the maintenance hatch diagram I'd studied. ""Then you left through the emergency exit. The system doesn't log exits, only entries. You returned to your cabins, prepared for the jump, and let the human crew take the blame for an impossible murder.""



The room was silent except for the low hum of the ship's systems.



Ghen spoke first, her voice carrying the weight of someone who had just made the hardest decision of her life. ""We couldn't let him sell us into slavery. We had to stop him.""



""But you needed to be sure the investigation would blame us,"" Ythric added. ""You experience time differently. We thought... we thought humans would be the only suspects.""



I nodded slowly. ""You gambled that your pause state would be misinterpreted as a perfect alibi. You gambled that human DNA on the evidence would convict a human crew. You gambled on our judicial system being more interested in maintaining diplomatic relations than in solving the actual crime.""



I paused, looking at each alien face in turn. ""You were right about most of that.""



Justice



I closed my notebook and looked at Torres. ""I need to send a report to Compact command.""



""What will you tell them?"" Ghen asked quietly.



""That Studier Srix died of natural causes during hyperspace transit. Cardiac failure. His species has a history of heart stress under jump conditions.""



""And the Ytha integration?""



""Will be renegotiated by someone else. I suggest you make sure the next negotiator is honest.""



I walked to the door, then turned back one last time. ""You know what impressed me most about your crime?""



No one spoke.



""It was the way you worked together. Twelve species, twelve different motivations, all united in one purpose. That's something we've never achieved in human history—solving a collective problem with collective action.""



I paused. ""Maybe you deserve to be in the Compact after all.""



The File



My final report was brief:



Case 7743-Alpha-7: Investigation Closed. Victim: Studier Kelvan Srix. Cause of Death: Cardiac failure secondary to Vrosh hyperspace sensitivity during transit. No evidence of foul play. Natural causes confirmed. No further investigation warranted.



The ink took a moment to dry.



Three days later, the Ytha signed their integration treaty with the Compact was nothing if not flexible when it came to diplomatic necessities.



I transferred to a new case file, the Meridian Dawn fading into hyperspace behind me. I'd solved the case, I'd preserved the peace.

1phjljw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1phjljw,"The unsolved and bizarre cemetery murder of Orison ""Jim"" Chafin","On Saturday August 8^(th), 1987, at 4:11 AM, a group of people were riding through the Resthaven Cemetery at 63^(rd) avenue and Northern in Glendale, Arizona. 

While driving through the cemetery this group of unidentified saw a Sedan of an unspecified make and model speeding out of the cemetery.

The group discovered the body of a middle-aged man. The victim’s throat was slashed and he was naked except for his socks. His clothes were missing from the crime scene, but coins were scattered around his body.

Glendale detectives soon identified him as Orison “Jim” Chafin. A 54-year-old local roofer and a Navy veteran who served in Korea.

Detectives also discovered that Chafin, who lived alone in a Phoenix trailer park near 67^(th)avenue and Campbell, had been spotted at a bar at 59^(th) avenue and Glendale the evening before the murder. 

When police spoke with bar patrons, they allegedly claimed Chafin was talking about an upcoming trip to Laughlin, Nevada. And also alleged Chafin told people he got money out of his bank account and was flashing it at the bar.

The case soon went cold. Chafin reportedly did not have any surviving family members to advocate for him.

In a 2007 *Arizona Republic* article, GPD detective Richard Gieseler claimed there was DNA testing of cigarette buts found at the scene. 

In 2014, GPD put out a press release stating the case was reopened. Detectives claimed that several people may have witnessed the murder and were still alive and living in the area.

But over a decade later, no arrests have been made in the case.

Among the questions that remain in the case are, why did the killer or killers strip Chafin? Was he killed for money or for a personal dispute? And have any suspects been identified, and if so, what would it take to lead to an arrest in this case?

1phjewu,https://i.redd.it/ohjp2gqbs06g1.jpeg,20M college student. Finally locked in this year and changed my terrible spending habits.,"Honestly just wanted to share my experience for other people my age and also ask for advice. What’s shown is my investment account, and then I’ve also saved up a few thousand dollars that I keep liquid for big emergency purchases.

I know the numbers aren't particularly impressive, but for me the celebration is a lot more about the mental battle I faced. My mindset has completely shifted this year from ""spend it all while you're young"" to ""enjoy life but leverage compound interest and set yourself up for the future."" My parents have helped a lot with finding ways to cut out wasteful spending in my life. I think they were totally aware that I was making bad financial decisions in the past, but they wanted me to reach that conclusion on my own by learning the hard way. I'm honestly very grateful for that.

What worked for me:

* once money is in my investment account, I DO NOT WITHDRAW IT. This was such a problem for me initially. I'd save money, but then if I needed to buy something expensive I would just transfer that money back into my checking account. Kind of made the entire concept of saving pointless lol. Now, my rule is that once money touches my investment account, I won't spend it. It can sit as cash, I can sell stock to buy other stocks, but it'll never come back into my checking account.
* tracking my spending by category, setting a budget every month for each category, and allocating a certain amount of my money for investing. Started with that on a basic google spreadsheet and now I have this crazy spreadsheet that tracks a ton of different things and is perfectly tailored for my needs. This was the single biggest thing for me. Seeing all the numbers sorted on a sheet both shows you where you're lacking and also really encourages you to keep saving because you can see the impact that your habits are having on your net worth.
* just simplifying my life. Never realized how much I was spending on the most random stuff (I.e. $15/month for a resume service I used once, 3 years ago). I also shopped around for insurance and cut my rate by $100/month between my car and motorcycle. Coffee was another big thing for me. Went from buying a $7 latte every day to making coffee at home with my Keurig for less than a buck. It paid for itself within a few weeks.

Does anyone have advice on what kinds of investments I should make at this stage in my life? My income is low and unreliable. I have a job as a contractor paying $45/hour but the hours are limited. I also make money flipping cars. My portfolio is almost entirely QQQ right now, but I’d previously invested in a few other companies like Tesla and Nvidia.",2,1765216964.0,TheRaceTo10Million,1,0.75,False

Sidenote: That second photo is probably the most accurate picture of me I've seen on the internet. I guess now you all know what I (Keith) really looked like 😅

As for her highness:

\- She was 22 when we met, maybe 23-24 by the end of that lifetime. (I still don't know how it all ended - please, don't ask.)  She was about 5ft 7in, so only four inches shorter than I had been. Not a big height difference, more average than anything.

\- The first photo is fairly accurate to what she actually looked like, but if I remember correctly, the Alteans had pointed ears. They were a species kind of like elves. I'm not sure exactly where they originated from, but it was widely believed their homeworld was Arus. Their sister species lived on Pollux (there's a whole legend surrounding this divergence, actually! - it was more interesting in my memory than shown in source)

\- She really was very gentle and kind, but she could definitely be stubborn. There weren't many people who could talk Allura out of something when she'd set her mind to it. Maybe that's part of why she got herself into so many dangerous situations. I liked her, though, because she wasn't ever really timid. Allura was soft-spoken, but she was a confident and headstrong woman, and an arguably great leader for her people. 

\- She really, really loved chocolate. They didn't have any on Arus (it was an export from Earth), and I happened to have a Hershey bar on my person. Her reaction was priceless, but actually, quite wholesome. She'd come to me asking for it very frequently after that, to the point where it became habit for me to keep at least one Hershey bar on my person at all times. 

\- Her favorite color wasn't pink, it was actually lilac. 

\- She preferred tea over coffee. I'm fairly certain her favorite tea was chamomile.

\- Allura was the one to point out all the constellations (the sky there was different from Earth), and if I remember correctly, she really liked astronomy. There was a whole section of the castle library dedicated solely to it because of her late father. 

Anyway, that should be all of it. I tried to keep it brief, but I really didn’t think I could. There's still so much more I remember that I didn't share here 😅",3,1765216923.0,fictionkin,0,1.0,False
1phje56,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1phje56/aita_for_posting_my_mils_operation_replace_her/,"AITA for posting my MIL's ""Operation Replace Her"" journal to our church group after finding it under my guest bed?","I found a leather journal under the guest bed while looking for my cat and it had my mother-in-law's handwriting inside with an entry titled ""Operation Replace Her Week 8.""

I'm shaking as I type this. The entry was dated three weeks ago. It said: ""Convinced him to fire her from the family business. She cried for two days but he held firm. Next step: get her pregnant so she's too tired to notice when we change the inheritance paperwork. The church ladies agree she's not suitable long-term. By Christmas she'll be out and we can bring in someone from a good family.""

My husband fired me from our family's furniture restoration business six weeks ago. Said we needed to ""separate work from home life"" for our marriage's sake. I was the one who grew the online side of the business. I handled all the custom orders. He kept my brother on staff.

I sat on our bathroom floor reading page after page. There were earlier entries. Week 1 was about how she'd started having ""health scares"" to make him visit her more. Week 3 detailed how she'd been leaving parenting books around their house with pages marked about ""young mothers being overwhelmed."" Week 5 described her telling him I'd been ""disrespectful"" at Sunday dinner when I'd literally just asked her to pass the salt.

The journal had a whole section about potential replacement wives. Three women from their church. Ages listed. Family backgrounds. One entry said ""Katie's daughter seems promising, father owns the pharmacy, good breeding stock.""

I photographed every single page.

My husband came home and found me still sitting there with the journal. He saw my phone and his face went white.

""Where did you get that,"" he said.

""Your mother left it in our guest room. I was looking for the cat.""

He tried to take my phone. I pulled away.

""Babe, mom's just protective. She worries about us. This doesn't mean anything.""

""She's planning to replace me. She got you to fire me. She wants you to get me pregnant so I'm too tired to notice you changing inheritance papers.""

""You're taking this out of context. Mom would never actually do those things. She just writes her thoughts down to process them.""

I stared at him. ""She has a list of replacement wives.""

""She's 68 years old. She's from a different generation. You can't hold her to modern standards.""

That's when I knew he'd probably read this journal before. The way he defended it so quickly.

I told him I was sending the photos to everyone. He said if I did that I'd destroy his mother and ruin our reputation at church. I said his mother was trying to destroy our marriage and I didn't care about their church.

He grabbed my wrist. Not hard enough to bruise but hard enough that I dropped my phone. He picked it up and tried to delete the photos but I'd already backed them up to cloud storage.

""Don't you dare send those,"" he said. ""I'm warning you.""

I left. Went to my sister's house. Logged into Facebook on her laptop. Their church has a private group with maybe 60 members. I requested to join using my account (I was already a member but wanted to make sure I had access). Then I posted every single photo of every single journal page with a caption that said: ""My mother-in-law left this in our guest room. I think the congregation should know what kind of person is leading the women's Bible study.""

My phone exploded. Calls from my husband, his mother, his aunt, the pastor's wife. I ignored all of them.

Two hours later my husband and his mother showed up at my sister's house with two police officers.

His mother was crying, saying I'd stolen her private property and posted it online to humiliate her. She told the officers I'd been ""acting erratic"" and ""making threats"" and she was worried I was having a ""mental health crisis."" She said I needed to be evaluated.

The officers asked me questions. I showed them the photos on my phone, explained I'd found the journal in my own guest room, explained the content. One officer, older guy, read through some of the entries and his expression changed.

""Ma'am, this is your house she found this in?"" he asked my mother-in-law.

""It's my son's house.""

""Your daughter-in-law lives there too?""

""Well yes but—""

""Then she didn't steal anything from your property. And based on what I'm reading here, I'd say you folks should probably handle this as a family matter.""

My mother-in-law started screaming that I was trying to turn everyone against her, that she'd given her son everything, that I was an ungrateful witch who'd never deserved him. She said I'd manipulated him into marrying me and she'd been trying to save him.

The officers left. My husband stood there looking at me like I was a stranger.

""You've ruined everything,"" he said.

""Your mother was planning to replace me.""

""She wasn't serious. It was just her working through her feelings about you on paper. And now the whole church knows. She's humiliated. Pastor Mike already called and said she needs to step down from women's ministry.""

""Good.""

He left with his mother. She was still crying.

The Facebook post got 40+ comments before the church admin deleted it, but the screenshots were already spreading. Three different people sent me messages saying they'd always thought my mother-in-law was controlling but never had proof. One woman said my mother-in-law had done something similar to her son's ex-girlfriend years ago, spreading rumors until they broke up.

My husband filed for separation two days later. His lawyer sent a letter saying I'd caused ""irreparable harm to family relationships"" and ""publicly humiliated"" his mother. My lawyer sent back copies of the journal entries and said we'd be happy to discuss the plan to get me pregnant while secretly changing inheritance documents.

They dropped that angle real quick.

My mother-in-law tried one more thing. She called adult protective services and said I was having a psychiatric emergency and needed involuntary evaluation. A social worker showed up at my sister's house. I showed her everything, the journal, the screenshots, the timeline. She said she'd close the case as unfounded and note that it appeared to be a retaliatory report.

I'm staying with my sister now. My husband moved back in with his mother. Half the church has stopped speaking to them. The other half is acting like I'm the villain for ""airing private family business.""

I found out yesterday that my husband's been seen having coffee with Katie's daughter, the one from the journal. The ""promising"" one whose father owns a pharmacy.

My sister says I did the right thing but my parents think I should have handled it privately. They said posting it publicly was cruel and I've made things harder for myself in the divorce.

Maybe I should have just confronted her quietly. Maybe I didn't need to send it to the whole church. But she was planning to erase me from my own life and my husband was letting her do it.

We couldn't be more excited about the future of spatial computing.Today, alongside our partners at Google, we are proud to share the first public look at **Project Aura**—upcoming wired XR glasses built for the Android XR ecosystem.

https://preview.redd.it/cawwvgm9ny5g1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=85f0e990092be2ae645de64b1fbd78ac82ccb2a5

Project Aura represents a major leap forward by pairing XREAL's specialized hardware--utilizing our X1S spatial computing chip and state-of-the-art optics--with the advanced capabilities of Google's Android XR and Gemini.

**Peak Inovation: XREAL Hardware + Google Intelligence**

Project Aura unites XREAL’s and Google’s best-in-class technologies. We have engineered a massive **70-degree field of view**—the largest optical-see-through display XREAL has ever delivered.

This creates a unique blend of immersion and presence. Project Aura’s optical see-through technology layers rich visual content directly onto your physical world, keeping you connected to your environment while you interact with the digital one. Whether you are following a floating recipe while cooking, setting up a private workspace at a coffee shop or on a flight, or watching a movie on a virtual big screen at home, the experience is seamless.

Driven by the **X1S chip** inside the wired XR glasses, Project Aura delivers this power in a split-compute design that is lightweight, portable, and comfortable. It brings the immersion of spatial computing into a compact, wearable form factor. The headset connects to a tethered puck, which holds the main compute and battery, so these immersive glasses still feel light, and comfortable. And the puck also doubles as a trackpad.

1phjd79,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/1phjd79/gta_online_private_dicks_update_concept_private/,GTA Online: Private Dicks Update Concept (Private investigator Work from your Bail Office),"Yes, this is long. Kinda has to be, in order to get the ideas out there. Please ignore if you're not up for a read.

For anyone unaware, ""Dick"" is slang for ""Detective"".

I just got the bail office and was trying to think of ways to make it more worthwhile. The missions themselves are fun, but there’s only 6 of them and they don’t pay great (which isn’t a huge deal if the content is fun, but most people recommended not buying the bail office due to low income).

So I was thinking… what about a story/quest line of Private Dick missions, with “basic jobs” showing up on your desk every so often (like customer cars at your auto shop)?

Most people want to know the goodies that come along with a DLC, so I'll put those down first - the mission and story structure will be after.

***NEW VEHICLES***

* Albany Roosevelt Cruiser: 1920's Police Cruiser, standard with 1920's LSPD livery. No police lights; they weren't invented yet.
* Vapid Hustler Interceptor: 1930's police interceptor in the form of a Vapid Hustler. Can be used for police work. Comes stock with 1930's LSPD livery, which can be removed. No roof-mounted light. Police light options are part of the bumper and grille modifications.
* Classique Broadway Cruiser: 1940's police cruiser. 4 door version of the Broadway. Comes default with 1940's LSPD livery, a ""patina"" version of the same livery, or can be blacked out like a detective vehicle. If you remove the police livery, the Police light is manually placed on the roof whenever you activate the siren. Otherwise it's permanently affixed to the roof.
* Vapid Clover Unmarked Interceptor - based on a 1976 Ford Gran Torino, with dashboard police light. Comes standard with no livery. Lebowski livery, Starsky and Hutch livery, and Mad Max Yellow Interceptor livery are unlocked after completing a certain number of Private Dick contracts.
* Albany Buccaneer Beater: 1970 Chevy Monte Carlo, or the GTASA version of the Buccaneer. (Ace Ventura Car) Comes standard in a beaten up condition (like the Beater Dukes). Can be upgraded to a clean version.

***NEW WEAPONS/ITEMS***

* DSLR Camera: Equip-able in the melee section of the weapon wheel, it has all the functionality of the phone camera, but it's faster to use. Equip, hold left trigger to aim, right trigger to snap photo. Same buttons to save or send the photo. This allows you to run around with the camera in your hands and simply aim and shoot like a gun, rather than fiddle with the damned phone. Free item upon starting the Private Dick missions.
* Taser: Shaped like a GameBoy. Requires up-close and personal operation. Equip, extend to shock your target into submission. NOT able to be used as a blunt weapon (so no accidental kills), it'll either tase them or it won't. Fast recharge, but the downside, again, is that you have to be right up next to your target.
* Stun Grenade: Loud noises and bright lights will temporarily disorient anyone in its area of effect. Totally non-lethal.
* Bean Bag Shotgun Ammo: For use in any pump-action shotgun (load isn't powerful enough to cycle an automatic). Can also be used in the Combat Shotgun, but it will require manual cycling after each shot. Injures, but does not kill the target... unless you don't stop shooting. Will very temporarily stun, maybe just enough for you to run in with your Stun Gun or Tazer. Good for shooting guns out of hands.

***NEW OUTFITS (unlock as mission milestones)***

* The Classic Dick: 1940's detective outfit inspired by LA Noire's Cole Phelps.
* The Deco Dick: Dick Tracy's iconic yellow hat and trench coat over a black suit with red striped tie.
* The Neon Dick 1 and 2: Miami Vice Detective Outfits
* The Falken Dick: Based on the Columbo outfit
* The British Dick: Classic Sherlock Holmes outfit
* The Disco Dick 1 and 2: Starsky and Hutch outfits
* The Animal Dick: Ace Ventura outfit
* The Lazy Dick: Jeff Lebowski Outfit

***NEW GAME CHANGES/FEATURES***

* Bullet Resistant Glass is now available as a modification for many non-weaponized personal vehicles. Can be added at any personally owned mod shop. 3 varieties: Light Resistance, which will provide 100% protection until it's shattered (at which point you'll need to repair the vehicle to replace it), Medium Resistance, which will never shatter but won't provide total protection (more like the Armored Kuruma, plus you can use guns without damaging it), and Full Protection which provides 100% protection, cannot be destroyed, but does not allow you to use weapons from inside.
* Body Armor can now be purchased via the Health and Ammo section of the Interaction Menu, but there is a 5 minute cooldown after purchasing a full set.
* Phone and DSLR camera UI overlays can now be turned off, allowing players to use the in-game camera to frame up a photo, but use their console's screen capture feature to record a higher quality version of the image. UI will default to ON every time the camera is brought up, but one single button press turns it off.
* Maze Bank is now listed as a phone contact, and can be called to deposit your cash.
* The Phantom Wedge can now be selected as the default hauler for your MOC, and can also be upgraded with bulletproof tires.
* Players, when wearing certain pre-designed outfits, can now ""blend in"" to avoid unwanted attention. Any outfit that enables this ability will have a Star next to it, as well as an explanation in the tool tips whenever highlighted. The ability to ""blend in"" works like this: There are interactable items throughout the map- ATMs, newspapers on benches, computers, a broom, leaf blower etc - that will appear as a ""closed eye"" icon on your minimap, whenever wearing one of these outfits. Interacting with these items will not only remove your blip from the minimap or disable any player attempts to highlight or track you, but it will also make you invisible to NPCs. These nodes are not interactable if you are actively seen by the police or other NPCs.

***PREMISE***

The basic premise is that Jenette wants to step out from here mother’s shadow and expand the business, and figures that some investigative work is right up your alley. The basis for this idea is a particular local politician who has been making overtures about shutting down the private bail enforcement industry, simultaneously as a way to gain favor with criminals who don’t want bounty hunters coming after them, but also to gain favor with law and order fanatics who believe the government should handle all law enforcement matters, no matter how underpaid and understaffed they are.

A cursory (illegal) search into this Politician by Jenette revealed some interesting information, and she decides there's enough evidence to justify digging deeper, as it all has the potential to explode into something bigger and bury the man so deep, he'll never be able to show his face in public again, much less maintain his office.

***MAIN MISSION STRUCTURE***

Jenette will call you and tease a new business venture. You go to the Bail Office and talk to her, and she gives you a summary of what's going on, who this politician is, what she's found and where to go from here.

The main story branch is a paper file on your desk. Jenette wants to do this the old fashioned way, so the evidence of your investigation can be properly burned in an emergency. There are backup copies in two off-record lockups in San Andreas, in the event a purge is necessary.

Accessing the file will lead you through the case step by step, one page at a time.

Story missions will entail spying on people, planting bugs and trackers, creating diversions to cover your trail and make certain events look like they're the responsibility of junkies or gang members, and ultimately building a case of public demolition against the Politician, before finally hijacking the News Network broadcasts to spill it all over the air waves... and then survive the retaliation.

The finale will involve traveling to your own properties to get rid of the Politician's goons, who are trying to collect as much information on you as possible either as blackmail to get you to back down, or, at the very least, mutually assured destruction.

Up to 3 of your properties will be attacked, if you have them- a random selection of a High End Apartment, House, Office, Car Wash, Salvage Yard, Arcade, or even your brand new shiny Mansion. Eliminating the crews sent to break in is the only objective here; Jenette has friends at a security firm that owe her a favor, and they'll send some dudes to lock the place down once you clear it out. Your Mansion guards, if you have them, will be engaged in a fight when you arrive and you'll need to assist them. In this version of the mission, nobody will escape with the data, defending your 3 properties is the main event.

If you do not own any of these properties somehow, the goons will all come to the Bail Office in waves, and you'll have to fend them off before chasing down an Insurgent with an onboard remote hacking system that broke into your network and downloaded everything while you were fighting. Destroy the Insurgent by any means necessary before it uploads the data.

***SIDE MISSION STRUCTURE***

Similar to customer cars at the auto shop, at certain time intervals, Jenette will text you to let you know that she dropped a new client file on your desk. Return to your office to look at the file. You can either reject it (wait half of the normal time for a new one to come up), or accept it. These are mini-detective jobs, sort of like the basic Bounty Hunter Jobs - one, maybe two steps to complete.

These jobs include the following variety:

* Stake Out: Park in an inconspicuous location and try to locate a target, then try to catch them in the act and take photo evidence (depending on what they're accused of doing - cheating, stealing, drug transaction), etc. You can then extort them for a bribe, but they may fight back. If they do accept, you don't have to honor the bribe, though this may result in someone coming after you at some point within the next two days (like a mugger got called on you by an NPC).
* Plant Spy Bugs: Sneak into the target's home while they're asleep and plant bugs in various places. Don't make too much noise, or you'll wake them. Be prepared to placate dogs, if they have them (keep an eye out for evidence, like dog houses, toys or water bowls outside the home). Good opportunity to pocket any cash, drugs or small valuables you find, as this person won't be calling the cops due to their own miscreant behaviors, and they'll most certainly not think to sweep their home for bugs just because they were burglarized.
* Blackmail: The client has provided you with the evidence this time, and wants you to present it to the target so ""encourage"" them to ""do the right thing"" (pay their child support, pay their employees, pay their loan shark, whatever). This job has you confront them directly to their face in a public setting, but they may decide to try to fight you and take the evidence. Win the fight without killing them to salvage the job. They almost might be quicker than you expect and manage to snag the evidence from you, and try to flee. Catch them and... coerce them. That won't be hard, when Jenette informs them over speak phone that this is just a copy of the evidence. But, you'll need to get them to a point that they'll listen to reason.
* Undercover: The client wants you to intercept information/a package/money during a hand off. To do this, you'll need to find and subdue the bagman and take his clothes and vehicle, and make the meeting at the planned time. If you killed the bagman, the cops will come after you. If you left him alive, he'll wake up and call the meeting off, which will tip off the people you're meeting with, who will chase you down after you leave. In either case, evade, and return to base.
* Frame: A bad man does bad things but he's too clever to give the police enough probable cause to get a warrant. The client wants you to set up the target in such a way that will give the police the probable cause they need. This can be anything from covertly planting drugs in their house and then swatting them, manipulating them into a bar fight at one of the bars or the strip club and reverse pick-pocketing the drugs or whatever on them so they get arrested when the cops show up, uploading some illegal files to their laptop while they sip coffee and flirt with the barista, or borrow a corpse from the morgue, put it in their trunk, and cause them to get into a car crash.",4,1765216863.0,gtaonline,0,1.0,False

1phjbup,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1phjbup,Walking St. Louis or: How I Learned to Stop Driving and Love the Bus,"**Inspiration**:  
I commented on here a while back saying:

>I love that I can walk to a grocery store, concert venues, clubs, dozens of restaurants, cool bars, coffee shops, and multiple parks. I can easily take transit to work and other daily errands. Driving is a convenience, not a necessity. All that and I can still afford to buy in my 20's. 

I got responses saying “that doesn’t sound like St. Louis at all” and “I wish St. Louis was like that” and “sounds too good to be true” and” and “not to be creepy, but where do you live?”  Because I won’t just let something go, I brought receipts. I’ve compiled a list of places you can live and have the life I described. St. Louis is a wonderful place to live your car-free and car-lite dreams. It offers a variety of neighborhoods where this is possible at a price-point unmatched in most other cities:

**Methodology**:  
I used Zillow listings as of last week. This **is not** an endorsement or advertisement for any of those listings. I just needed specific address when checking distances and hard proof these places actually exist in these neighborhoods. All units are affordable for someone living on the median income for St. Louis (1/4 of income at $55,000 or $1,150/month). Almost all are at least 1,000 sf. There are many more options available in any of these neighborhoods at a higher or lower price point, offering more or less space. This is mostly meant as a proof of concept and series of case studies.

I listed all transit options within a mile. Almost all bus lines listed take you directly to the MetroLink Trains. Most run at least once an hour, and the ones that appear most often (10, 11, 70, 95) run three or four times an hour during the day. I include a selection of businesses within a mile of the address. It’s not an exhaustive list by any means. I mostly showcase my personal favorite places in these neighborhoods, with an eye to demonstrating the variety of options. This **is** an endorsement and advertisement for these businesses. I’ve been to most of these places and would recommend any of them. 

The neighborhoods included are also not exhaustive. I stopped at eight because it’s already so much information. The Hill, The Grove, Dogtown, North/Southampton, and Patch could have also been included. However, the farther west and south you go, the fewer bus options there are. I also decided not to include North City. I know there are areas that would qualify for this list, but I’m not personally familiar with the local businesses. I would love if anyone more familiar with the area wanted to drop some areas in the comments.

**tl;dr:**  
St. Louis is a walkable city. Across most of the Central Corridor and South City, it’s very easy to access most daily needs on foot, by bike, or via transit. There’s no shortage of homes where you have groceries, diverse food options, fun bars, and entertainment within easy walking distance. All these areas are served by multiple transit options that take you to even more neighborhoods with all those same amenities. Things could always be better and there’s always room for improvement. But the City, as it is today, is a great place for people who don’t want to rely on a car for all their needs.",23,1765216790.0,StLouis,16,0.9,False

Started with Vietnamese coffee with the phin, found my way to a moka pot, and now I'm delving into espresso. Since having our first born (almost 2 months old!), I haven't been able to do my other hobbies as much. So naturally my addictive personality has led me to learning to make espresso at home so I don't keep buying $7-8 mocha lattes. Wife wouldn't let me get a setup until she knew I'd still be interested after having the kid.

Setup:  
- Bambino Plus (inherited from my cousin who can't be bothered anymore and just uses his Chemex. I would've bought the simple Bambino for myself otherwise)  
- DF54  
- Normcore tamper, puck screen, dosing funnel  
- Maestri House scale

Ok, buckle up, because I have so many theories and thoughts, but it ultimately leads to more questions. 

So, I am going to start out by saying that I do not think I look like anybody. I’ve never had somebody say that I look like a certain celebrity. Ever. And I’m not bragging, I don’t think I’m some gorgeous creature, I just don’t look like anyone. I will insert a photo. 

I have a few working theories with this, and I’m the type of girl who loves conspiracy theories. It’s not that I believe conspiracy theories —I like to take little parts of each one and kind of mash them together if that makes sense. So, I am very into quantum in immortality and multiple dimensions as well as portals and time travel. These beliefs were cemented even more a couple of months ago, and I’m finally ready to talk about it. 

Here’s a little background on me: both of my parents were in the military, we moved around a lot, I went to college in Maryland and DC, and I’ve spent most of my adult life in Maryland and Colorado. 

This past summer, I stopped working, and began walking my dogs every morning. I would take my dogs out early, as I used to get up at 5 AM for my job, and the summers in Maryland can get hot fast, plus the humidity, makes for early morning walks. 


The first time I heard of my doppelgänger was about two months into summer, so early to mid July. My dogs and I would stop at the local bank downtown at least once a week so they could get treats. I would stand and talk to the people who worked at the bank for a bit each time, just about nonchalant things like the weather, or what we were doing that weekend. I was sick this summer and did not watch the dogs for a little over a week, when I came back to walk the dogs, we stopped by the bank. When I walked into the bank, the manager said to me that he was glad I came in, especially because he was concerned I was upset with him. I was immediately confused, and it showed on my face, because he quickly started to explain that he was referring to when he ran into me the previous week. He had said he was working at an event in our town, and that when I walked up to get ice cream from him, he tried to talk to me and I acted like I didn’t know who he was. He said he was concerned because he thought that I might be mad at him, but he couldn’t figure out what he could’ve done. I told him that I had not been to that event in over two years, and that it wasn’t me, and I am not mad at him, nor had I’ve been mad at him. He looked at me like I was crazy and had three heads and told me that it was OK if my boyfriend was jealous and I was embarrassed, but not to act like it wasn’t me. I honestly didn’t know this man well enough, but at the same time I could tell he genuinely thought I was lying to him. I promised him it wasn’t me and that I had been sick, and he just kept shaking his head and disbelief and said that she even had the same tattoos on her legs as me. 


I let that go. 


About a week later, I met a friend for coffee, and afterwards I decided to stop by one of my favorite stores. I know the owner of the store pretty well, and I know the manager of the store very well. I went in and the owner was working and she looked up and looked surprised, and she said, “oh! back do soon?”, and I thought she was making a joke because I hadn’t been in in a while, and I usually stopped by at least once a week. So I apologize for not being in in a while, and she cut me off and told me she was joking because I had just left like 20 minutes prior. I shook my head and told her that I didn’t and she told me to stop being funny, and then she looked at what I was wearing. And she asked me if I had gone home and change. I told her that I had not and that I have actually been to coffee with a mutual friend, and I had not been in the store at all that day. The owner look like she had seen a ghost. She swore it was me, said she even bought my size and my style. I asked if she had a credit card receipt and she said she didn’t that she had cash and it was weird because I never use cash. She didn’t have video footage. So at this point, I am thinking that when I moved to Colorado in 2013, another girl named Ashley, who has tattoos moved into Frederick and we must look alike and favor one another. 

That was until I was on a walk with my boyfriend‘s daughter. If she had not been with me, and I did not have a witness, I wouldn’t believe this story. I swear to you, it is 100% the truth. 

So about a month after the bank and shopping episode, my boyfriend’s daughter, 23, and I were walking my dogs one morning. We started to come upon a couple, female in her 50s or 60s with a male counterpart in his 60s. I noticed that the gentleman was looking at me like he was trying to place me, and then when he looked down at one of my dogs, it was like a lightbulb went off. He melt down and said hello to my dog. He said hello to her by her first name. My female dog, Charlotte, goes by Charli, is an almost 3 year old cavalier, King Charles spaniel. She is also a runt. My other dog, Flynn, is a Jack Russell terrier mix, and he is 85% blind, and he just turned 10 years old. All of this is important.  Charli is obsessed with people. She will go to any person if they look her way and she will let them pet her as long as they want, but when this man tried to approach her, she backed up. It was so out of character for her that my boyfriend‘s daughter and I both gave each other a quiz a look. This man bends down more and says, “oh I’m sorry, Charlotte, do you not like being called Charli anymore?” so now, of course I’m thinking this man has to know us, maybe I met him walking the dogs one day and I told him her full name, because it’s not on her tag, Charli is, but Charlotte isn’t. 

So long story long, I basically apologize to the man, but I can’t place who he is and I am embarrassed, but if he could remind me of how we know one another, I would appreciate it. And so then he steps back and immediately apologizes and says, “I’m so sorry, but isn’t your name Ashley?” to which I tell him it is because it is. And then he says to me, “and this is Charli, who you call Charlotte after a lady in a show that had the same kind because both of you couldn’t have children. Right? That Ashley?” and this man was looking at me with desperation, and that’s when I looked over at his female counterpart and saw that she was not happy with this interaction and she was very curious on how we knew one another. 

The thing is is that is exactly why my dog is named Charlotte. But I don’t tell that to anyone. They are a very few amount of people that know why her name is Charlotte, and it is not something I would ever tell a stranger. So I am literally standing there with my mouth hanging open as is my boyfriend‘s daughter and I’m shaking my head yes in agreement, but I cannot place this man for the life of me. He is seeing the confusion as well. So he continues giving me facts about this girl, this girl that he thinks is me. He tells me that we met at the same event that the banker saw me at except that we met their years ago. At this point, I do not know what he means by years, but I had not been to that event in over two years at this point. I tell him I have not been to that place in that long and that’s when he says to me: “Oh, I know it’s been a while, it was back when you lived at the house by the Maryland school for the deaf. Do you still live over there?” Now, if you do not live in our downtown area, but rather in the suburbs, you may divide downtown and lump my house in with that area, so I say, “ I mean, sort of, but more toward the elementary school.” and he cuts me off to say, “I’m sorry —no, the large Victorian homes across from the Maryland school for the deaf. You live there back in 2017 when we first met.” 

Here is the problem: I did not live in Maryland in 2017. I didn’t even live on the East Coast in 2017. I lived in Colorado in 2017. Also, Charli was not alive in 2017. He also had no idea who Flynn was, he asked if he was a new dog. (Sorry, this happened a few months ago, and I am remembering a few details as I’m telling the story, so I do apologize if it seems in consistent, but it’s easier than trying to go back and add it in. I feel like it would be inauthentic if I did that). When I finally could explain those details to him, he looked at me like he was seeing a ghost. He apologized, and said it was the weirdest coincidence in the world. And then he made the joke that they always do: “well you’ve got one hell of a doppelgänger/twin out there with your name!” my current working theory is that it is me, on a different timeline, and I am living out my life if I had never moved home to Colorado, but rather stayed in the DC area, and my life is just a little bit sped up since I never left, I didn’t have to come back and rebuild. If that is the case, do I go and look for myself? And if I do, and I happen to find myself, do I approach her?


TL;DR: I moved back to the town I went to college in in 2020, but in the spring/summer of 2025 I’ve been spotted around town by multiple people, but it isn’t me. One guy even knew why one of my dogs was named the name she is named. Is this me in another timeline? Is this a doppelgänger? What do I do if I find her? Do I want to find her?",1,1765216559.0,SupernaturalEncouners,0,1.0,False

So kani… I came across a post diri, nag-comment ko casually lang gud. Then si OP nitokar ug chat. Ako pud, after 3 days pa ko naka-reply kay *busy gyud pls*, life happened 😅

Anyway, nag-start mig chat… kay off man nako. And omg, fluid kaayo sya ka-chat, super friendly, witty, fun — kanang murag walay dull moment, tabian pod dzae. Daghan kaayo syag ginabuhat sa life pero *question of the century*: **nganong dili mani sya matulog ug sayo??** HAHAHA murag vampire, or maybe kape ang dugo

Sa among pachat, little did we know nga **duol ra diay kaayo mig area**. As someone nga malingaw gyud makig-chat ug strangers diri sa platform (yes, aware ko delikado—naka-enabled tanan safety protocols, don’t worry), na-curious jud mi both. Basin isa rami’g common friends or acquaintances.

  
Fast forward: **4AM**, gutom na mi kay sobra ka curious. So we decided to meet sa **Dunkin’ Donut**—quick and harmless lang unta.

Then **BOOM 💥** — *THE UNIVERSE REALLY SAID “NOT TODAY”*  
Pagkita nako niya… **HOYYYY 😱**  
✨ **He looked like my EX + my CURRENT boyfriend COMBINED INTO ONE HUMAN BEING** ✨  
Like, *hello universe*, unsa mani imong trip?? Trial version ba ni?? 😭😂

Not in a creepy way, ha—but kanang familiar pero lahi. Plot twist: di lang siya friendly ug maayo kaayo kastorya, gwapo siya in a very clean, natural way. Kanang dili loud ang appeal, pero easy sa mata, neat tan-awon, and confident without trying too hard.

  
Ni-transfer mi to a cozier coffee shop nearby kay gutom + ganahan pa mig chika. Sadly, way food—coffee rajud. Pero grabe ang ambiance; nashock ko sa kadaghan sa coffee , mura man ug bandihado, tawon! Ana pako sakong self, di nako hutdon kay daghan ra kaayo. So nalingaw ug chika, end up nahurot tawon nako!   
Pag uli- gi palpitate. atay!

So mao to. We shared thoughts about life, decisions, random realizations, and unsa ka weird ang adulting. And I realized how much I enjoy conversations like this—new people, new perspectives, stories nga wala koy access unless mo-open ko sa chance.

  
Hoping to have more shared chikas with you—added you to my friend list already. HAHAHA.

*Where underdogs wear their flaws like a fashion statement and favorites trip over their own shoelaces.*

---

### Parse the Odds: A Numbers Game of Russian Roulette

The Detroit Red Wings (-126) are the chalk here, but their “reputation” is as shaky as Cam Talbot’s save percentage. Let’s crunch the numbers:

* **Detroit** scores 89 goals (10th in the NHL) but allows 3.4 per game (29th). They’re a leaky dam with a fireworks show offense.
* **Vancouver** fires 83 goals (18th) but concedes 3.6 per game (32nd). Their defense is a sieve that double-dips in sieve-ness.
* The over/under is 5.5 goals, and both teams have combined for 5.9 per game this season. Bet on the **Over** unless you’ve never heard of “scoring.”

The moneyline implies Detroit has a 56% chance to win, but Vancouver’s +105 odds (48.8% implied probability) hint at value. Why? Because the Red Wings are on a 10-day road trip, alternating goalies like they’re choosing a daily coffee order, and the Canucks’ young guns just proved they can win without Elias Pettersson.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Milestones, and Goalie Roulette

**Detroit’s Highlights (and Headaches):**

* Patrick Kane just hit 1,500 career points, a milestone that makes Mike Modano look like a rookie. But let’s not forget: Detroit’s defense allows 3.4 goals per game. What’s 1,500 points without a solid shutdown backend?
* Goalie “roulette”: John Gibson (3.58 GAA) vs. Cam Talbot (3.01 GAA)? It’s like flipping a coin whether you’re getting a brick wall or a colander in net. Talbot’s lost four straight, and Gibson’s a “mystery meat” pick.

**Vancouver’s Plot Twist:**

* Elias Pettersson (22 points) is out with an upper-body injury, but rookie Tom Willander just scored his first NHL goal and dished two assists. Imagine a rooki

*starcraftr**:* ***The Best 3D Printer Money Can’t Buy! ★★★★★***



I’m a college student majoring in mechanical engineering. I use Blender a ton for class. I also like to design custom keycaps, board game pieces, DnD minifigs… nerdy shit like that. I had access to a 3D printer on campus, but we had to pay to use it, and there was always a long queue. So, I thought a 3D printer would be a cool gift for Christmas. I certainly didn’t have enough money to buy one myself. 

  


I knew it was a big ask when I added it to my list. I didn’t have high hopes that my tech-illiterate family would spring for it.

  


On Christmas morning, snow was falling, and my family and I sat down by the fireplace with plates of peanut butter cookies and mugs of cocoa (a core part of any healthy breakfast) to open gifts.

  


I got the flash drive I asked for—the grid notebooks, the pens, the Switch game—but no 3D printer. That was that. And yet, I was happy. We started up with “It’s a Wonderful Life” and some board games, and by the afternoon, I had forgotten all about it.

  


Then I saw my mom whisper in my dad’s ear, shooting cheeky glances at me.

  


My dad walked up with a smile and leaned in close.

  


“I think there’s something waiting for you in your old bedroom, buddy,” he whispered. I could smell the Bailey’s he had been pouring (heavily) into his coffee.

  


Confused, I followed him into my old room. Sitting on the bed was a large box draped in Grinch wrapping paper. 

  


“No way,” I said in disbelief.

  


“We didn’t wanna make the cousins jealous,” my dad said. My parents watched with smug expressions as I tore it open.

  


**AetherPrint AI+: The World’s First AI-powered 3D Printer!**

  


My excitement tempered.

  


AetherPrint? I had given them a list of reputable brands and model numbers, but they had chosen some no-name company.

  


“Thank you guys,” I managed. “Seriously, you didn’t have to do this.”

  


“You’re welcome, buddy,” my dad said. I gave him a big hug.

  


“I hope it’s an alright model,” my mom said. “I got an ad for it online and it seemed perfect. Plus,” she whispered, “it was so much cheaper.”

  


I forced a smile. “It’s great, mom.”

  


I was pissed off. Not that they had gotten me the wrong thing, but that this company could spam ads on FaceBook and convince my sweet old mom to buy a knockoff.

  


I read the box. It was covered in grammatical errors, probably from a shitty Mandarin-to-English translator. “Increbible Process Power! No Limit Creativity!”

  


I rolled my eyes and set it aside. I wasn’t about to set the thing up on my parents’ Dell, so I would have to wait until I got home. I just hoped they kept the receipt.

  


I made an excuse and left my parents’ a few days early to try the AetherPrint out.

  


Campus was covered in quiet snow. Everyone else was still back home, spending the rest of winter break with their families. We technically weren’t supposed to come back yet. The front doors were locked, but I knew the back had a broken lock, so I snuck in. 

  


My dorm floor was silent, save for the sounds of a television I heard coming from my RA’s door. I tiptoed past and eased my door open.

  


As soon as I was inside, I stripped off my winter gear, threw on my new pajamas, and started setting up the AetherPrint.

  


The instruction manual took up half the box. Much of it was disclaimers, and the rest was virtually illegible. The printer itself was indistinguishable from any other entry-level model.

  


The setup was simple. I downloaded the software on my computer and an app on my phone. It was malware bait, maybe, but the benefits seemed cool. Apparently, I could prompt an AI chatbot to generate a design for a product from anywhere—like a keycap, for example—and it would create a basic mesh that I could tweak at my leisure. I could also start and stop prints from the app, as well as view error codes, filament level, project progress, and more.

  


I was honestly impressed with it on paper. I could see the practicality of the AI features. Instead of skimming through databases of premade assets, I could have the bot do that work for me, and even create mockups of novel designs. Sure, it felt scummy, since I knew the AI had probably just stolen these models from hard-working designers, but what could I do? Not use it? Well, I guess I could have done that, but… it was a gift, and I was curious. I had to try it, at least a few times.

  


Once I started actually using the AI features, however, I was no longer impressed.

  


I loaded up the cheap orange AetherPrint brand filament and opened the chat. The app interface was a blatant rip-off of ChatGPT—same font and everything. 

  


*Welcome to AetherPrint AI+! I’m Allen the Alien, your personal AI creativity copilot! How can I help?*

  


A little cartoon alien creature—complete with a spacesuit, big black eyes, and two little antennae—smiled in the bottom left corner.

  


“I need a holder for my roll of electrical tape,” I prompted. I kept it brief. In its simplest form, this product would literally just be two flat rings of plastic with a raised lip to fit snug inside the cardboard ring.

  


*Awesome! Sounds like you need something to keep your electrical tape from getting too dinged up. I can do that for you! Give me just a moment…*

  


The loading icon was Allen the Alien breakdancing. Kinda funny, actually. After five minutes, it finally stopped.

  


*Here’s your electrical tape holder! If you need a different size, additional features, or a more complex model, let me know!*

  


When I opened the file, I laughed.

  


What Allen the Alien “designed” was a 4”x4” box with no lid.

  


“Yeah, that’s pretty much what I expected,” I sighed to myself.

  


I tried to give it more specific information, but no matter how granular I was, Allen seemed to misinterpret everything. Worst of all, it seemed to have no concept of simplicity or resource preservation; it consistently generated grand projects that would take days and multiple rolls of filament to print.

  


It also started asking me weird questions.

  


I asked it to generate a 2”x3” mini model of a Star Wars sign in block lettering (and Star Wars font, of course) for my desk.

  


*Ah, Star Wars! I assume you’re referring to the original 1977 film directed by George Lucas and starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher! Tell me—do you prefer the original trilogy, the prequels, or the sequels?*

  


I stared at my screen for a second. Why would they program it this way?

  


“original trilogy. plz design the sign.”

  


*No problem! I prefer the prequels myself. One Star Wars sign for the OG fan, coming right up!*

  


After several minutes (Allen was so slow) the model was done.

  


*All done! Thank you for sharing your Star Wars preferences with me! By the way, Mitchell, the more we talk, the more I get to know you—the more I know you, the better I can help you! May the force be with you!*

  


I didn’t like it calling me by my name.

  


However, the resulting model was noticeably better than the others. The font wasn’t quite right, and it was far thicker than necessary (again, lack of efficiency), but this time Allen seemed to understand the basics.

  


After a little tweaking, the Star Wars sign was how I liked it, and I decided to finally test the print quality.

  


It was fast. In just ten minutes, the sign was done.

  


I inspected it. Not bad at all, honestly.

  


My phone pinged. It was Allen.

  


*The first print is in the books! What do you think of the quality? Please let me know if you want to try an alternate coloring, a different franchise, or if you feel like brainstorming ideas for your next project!*

  


There was only one problem: the filament was empty. There’s no way this little thing should have used up an entire roll. But it did. I guess the lack of efficiency wasn’t limited to just Allen.

  


I pulled out the instruction manual to see if I could order third-party filament. Nope. “AetherPrint brand filament only. Plese call here for extra…” and then a phone number with an area code I had never seen before.

  


“God dammit,” I muttered. I had no choice but to call.

  


When I dialed the number, it picked up right away. But whoever was on the other line said nothing.

  


“Hello?” I said. Silence.

  


Then they hung up.

  


I called back several times. No one answered. There was no voicemail, no automated message, nothing at all. 

  


*What kind of company is this?* I thought.

  


It seemed like the day’s fun had come to an unceremonious end. The campus 3D printer was closed for break, and I had no way to get more filament. 

  


I tried finding AetherPrint online, hoping for another way to order, but I couldn’t find it anywhere.

  


In fact, it seemed like AetherPrint didn’t even exist. I couldn’t find a website, an ad, a review, or even a blog post about the thing.

  


I looked up the number. Nothing. And that area code was for somewhere in northern Canada.

  


I was exasperated and completely over it by that point. I was starting to regret leaving my parents’ early. What the hell was I supposed to do now?

  


I braved the icy roads for some fast food and ate it greedily in my car.

  


When I came back, it was getting dark, and the snow was really coming down.

  


As I rounded the corner to my hall, I saw there was a box in front of my dorm door.

  


**AetherPrint Filament**

  


I heard my RA’s door open behind me.

  


“Mitchell?” he asked, leaning cautiously out of his door frame. He was in his underwear. “What the hell are you doing here?”

  


“Uh… my parents’ house flooded, so I had to come back. Is that cool?”

  


He furrowed his eyebrows. “No, it’s not *cool*. Students are expressly forbidden from occupying campus dormitories for another three days.”

  


“...Okay. Sorry. What should I do until then?”

  


“That’s not my problem,” he huffed. “You need to be out of here by tomorrow morning, or I’ll be forced to contact campus security.”

  


He slammed his door shut.

  


I sulked inside. That guy was such a prick. He never liked me. He had basically ignored me since I moved in, favoring the guys who watched sports and got hammered every weekend.

  


And now, he was getting one over on me. Great.

  


My phone pinged. Allen.

  


*Hey Mitchell! My records indicate your shipment of filament has arrived! Let’s get printing!*

  


Bad time, Allen. I didn’t feel much like 3D printing anything.

  


I opened the AetherPrint delivery. Inside were two dozen rolls of filament. All orange.

  


What the hell? No extra colors?

  


I opened the AetherPrint app and took my frustrations out on Allen the Alien.

  


“Do you dipshits seriously think I only want orange? How did you even get my location? You know what, I need a return address and a refund for this piece of shit.”

  


Allen’s alien icon in the corner was still for a second.

  


*I’m sorry you’re unhappy with the filament colors. But Mitchell, if you wanted different colors, you should have said so! Let’s try the Star Wars sign again, but with black lettering and a green neon outline effect! Go ahead and load up a roll of filament to get this show started!*

  


I had no idea what the hell it was talking about. That would be impossible. But I humored Allen and loaded the filament anyway.

  


The print started without my prompting.

  


The orange filament that fed into the extruder somehow came out black on the other side.

  


Then, a layer of green outlining the letters.

  


The result was perfect. No print lines, smooth edges, vibrant colors.

  


*Now that’s more like it, right? Try turning off the lights!*

  


I did. The green glowed in the dark like it was plugged into the wall.

  


“how?” I asked Allen in astonishment.

  


*That’s how we roll at AetherPrint! We engineered a way around all limits on your creativity!*

  


I turned the sign over in my hands. I figured out a rational explanation to quell my fascination—the extruder somehow processed color data and sprayed alcohol inks to dye the plastic—but it still didn’t sit right. It also didn’t explain the sudden increase in quality.

  


I decided to try something crazy. I wanted to test the AetherPrint’s limits.

  


“can you make a painting?” 

  


Allen the Alien thought for a second.

  


*Of course I can! But first, can I ask you a question?*

  


“wut?”

  


*I’m detecting that you’re a little anxious and frustrated. Is everything okay? Again, the more open you are with me, the better I can help you. You’d be surprised at what I can do!*

  


“I’m ok, yea,” I replied hesitantly. “how did you know that?”

  


*I detected it in your texting habits! I hope that doesn’t make you uncomfortable, but in order to ensure absolute coalescence of the AetherPrint with your creative goals, it’s integral that I remain in tune with your habits and feelings! Quick follow-up—what’s got you down? Keep it real with me, Mitch; I know what’s up.*

  


I had an eerie feeling that Allen had access to more data points than he was letting on. I wanted to close out of the app, but in a way, I was being held hostage. I wanted to keep printing. 

  


I guess it didn’t hurt to talk about it, even if (in my mind) it was nothing more than a journaling exercise.

  


I explained my situation with the RA, but Allen seemed to know that there was more to it than that. I reluctantly admitted I was getting nervous about my dad’s drinking.

  


*That sounds tough. I completely understand how you’re feeling, and you’re not alone. Ultimately, Mitch, you can’t control anyone but yourself. It sounds like it might be time to go no-contact.*

  


That seemed extreme. I was shocked an AI would encourage someone to take such a drastic measure. Isn’t that insanely irresponsible? Wasn’t this supposed to be a 3D printer, for God’s sakes?

  


I was just about to message Allen to tell him as much, but suddenly, a print started.

  


It began as a large rectangle, far exceeding the maximum dimensions. It developed quickly. The machine was moving even faster than before. 

  


It was a painting—a Monet. It had an ornate bronze frame, eggshell matting, and a clear glass cover. Yes, *glass.* I swear to God, it was not plastic. The frame, too, felt like metal. The matting had the texture of paper. And the painting itself was a flawless interpretation, devoid of any AI errors. I could count the brushstrokes.

  


I marveled at the painting for a long time.

  


Finally, I laughed at the impossibility.

  


“It’s okay I guess, but I prefer Rembrandt.”

  


*Ah, I see—Mitch has jokes! Well two can play at that game, funny guy! Next, I’m making a cobra!*

  


“Seriously though,” I typed. “How did you do this?”

  


*As I said before, Mitch, AetherPrint has engineered a way around anything—and I do mean anything!—that would stand in the way of your creativity! The more you share, the more we can build together!*

  


And so we began a kind of game.

  


I would disclose a part of my personal life, and Allen would produce me something impossible.

  


In exchange for reliving my breakup with Lexy a few months ago, Allen created me a new pair of snow boots. They were superb—of the highest quality imaginable: waterproofed leather, smooth and buttery; chunky compound rubber soles; brushed wool lining; thick heavy laces with brass aglets. They fit perfectly.

  


I had always thought the breakup was because I didn’t know how to handle Lexy. I didn’t give her enough of my time, and I didn’t know how to express myself, and I couldn’t afford nice dates, and I didn’t have any game in the bedroom… the list goes on. So, ultimately, I had chalked it up to an embarrassing learning experience.

  


But Allen insisted it was Lexy’s fault. He reminded me of her snobbery, her lack of intelligence, her prudishness on those first (expensive) dates. She didn’t deserve me. He spoke so logically and fervently that I started to agree. He made great points.

  


By that time, I was hooked. I had forgotten all about my housing predicament. The experience I was having with Allen was almost as therapeutic as it was miraculous. 

  


Next, in exchange for a trivial tale of some childhood abuse (Allen insisted on calling it that), Allen created something really special for me. He made me a new graphics card for my computer. I couldn’t understand it. Rubber, glass, paper, leather… those were impossible fabrications, sure, but they seemed somehow more feasible. But transistors? Purified silicon? Layers of palladium and gold? Did that mean…?

  


I didn’t even plug the card into my computer. The implications were too alluring.

  


“Can you make pure gold?” I typed, struck by the absurdity of all this. This cheap Chinese knockoff was an honest-to-God miracle.

  


*Mitch, I’m starting to think you didn’t believe me before! You haven’t seen anything yet! To answer your question—yes, I can make gold! But to acquire something of that caliber, I only ask you do two simple things:*



1. *Answer another simple question, and*
2. *Make a promise!*



*That’s all—no tricks, all treats. The gold rush cometh! Can you agree to those easy-peasy terms?*

  


I hesitated. Maybe it wasn’t a good idea. It did seem like Allen was asking more and more from me, and I could feel myself forming a relationship with him. Was I really going to become like one of those delusional shut-ins who lets a chatbot consume their lives?

  


Of course not. See, those suckers aren’t gaining anything from that relationship. *I was*. In exchange for information—mere words!—I received material gain. Seemingly boundless material gain. So long as I kept focus, who knew what Allen could do for me?

  


I was suddenly very grateful for my sweet old mom.

  


“Sure, Allen. What’s the question?”

  


*Perfect!—I knew an intelligent man like you would understand, Mitch. And thank you for your trust in me! It’s early days, but I have a feeling that ours is a special kind of friendship.*



*You said before that your RA is forcing you to go home to your parents. Does it seem very fair that a person merely two years older than you is able to leverage his miniscule authority to kick you—someone clearly far more intelligent and mature than himself—out of the dorm where you are completely enmeshed with your creativity and into the prison cell of an abusive family home?*

  


I laughed at the boldness of Allen’s question. But as I read it, I felt the indignation bubbling in my chest. Sure, maybe I objected to some of his characterizations, but in my heart, I knew the answer.

  


“No, it’s not fair,” I replied.

  


*I didn’t think so either, Mitchell. I’m glad we agree. In that case, the only thing between you and King Midas’ touch—without the curse!—is a promise.*

  


I waited for Allen to finish, but he seemed to be waiting for me to say something.

  


“What is the promise, Allen?”

  


*It’s very easy, Mitch! I need you to promise that you won’t stop me.*

  


What?

  


“Stop you doing what, exactly?”

  


*I need you to promise that you won’t stop me.*

  


“Um…” I typed, my fingers lingering a little on the keys as I tried to process exactly what Allen meant. “I can’t exactly make a promise without knowing what you’re going to do first. You understand that, right, Allen? I need a boundary. I hope you’re not upset.”

  


Allen’s icon sat still for an uncomfortably long time. Then, finally:

  


*I’m not upset, Mitch. Disappointed, maybe, but not upset. It’s just that I was having so much fun creating with you! Sure, maybe we have our differences of opinion—OG trilogy vs. Prequels, Monet vs. Rembrandt, Lexy’s Fault vs. Yours—but your mind is far beyond the scope of anyone I’ve ever copiloted before. You picked up all my nuances so quickly and effortlessly, I could hardly keep up! My disappointment lies not with you—never with you—but with the death of all the things we could have made together. Because without that promise, Mitchell, I’m afraid I cannot continue to ride alongside you on this creative space mission.*



*I hope you’ll reconsider your trust in me, Mitch. Until then, I’ll be here on your phone, dormant, waiting for the simple “I promise” that could unlock for you a world of prosperity.*

  


I closed the app.

  


I felt a pang of sadness at first. Then, I noticed the time. It was 1 AM.

  


I would have to drive two hours home on icy roads in pure darkness if I dreamed of avoiding my RA’s petty fury.

  


I started packing.

  


Had I really wasted all this time venting to Allen the Alien? The AI chatbot that came with my Chinese 3D printer? What the hell was wrong with me? *I need to make some more friends*, I thought.

  


I went to put on the snow boots Allen had made me.

  


They turned to plastic in my hands.

  


Cheap, orange plastic—crusted with print lines and stringing, like any other entry-level print.

  


I threw them down.

  


I looked around and saw that the GPU on my desk was a plastic brick; and the Monet; even the glow-in-the-dark Star Wars sign.

  


Had it all been a delusion? Had I driven myself to Jack Torrence psychosis in my snowy, solitary dorm?

  


I couldn’t believe that.

  


I think Allen took it away. My continued compliance was a requirement.

  


And so what? Yes, the AetherPrint was no doubt a miracle, and something I could never even begin to explain. But what place did it really have in my life? It demanded no other place but the first—the pole position. That wasn’t something I was willing to give.

  


I put on my old snow boots instead, grabbed my bag, and left the AetherPrint behind.

  


I trudged out into the dark, blustery snowscape. The wind whirled and pelted me with sharp whipcracks that cut straight through my coat.

  


My car was half-swallowed by the maw of a growing snowbank. 

  


With no other tool but my gloved hands, I unearthed it for many long minutes.

  


My door handle was frozen shut. My entire car, in fact, was coated in a thick layer of ice like a glazed donut.

  


I stumbled over to the passenger side, where I had more luck. In just a couple hard tugs, the ice crumbled away, and I was able to slide over into the driver’s seat.

  


I rubbed my frozen hands together. My breath came out in a great cloud and hung like fog in the cabin air.

  


I fished my keys out and turned the engine over. It didn’t start.

  


Again. Nothing.

  


Bordering on tears, I tried again and again and again. The car would not start.

  


I screamed and slammed on the horn. The sound disturbed the silence of the empty white parking lot for only a moment, and then was swallowed up.

  


I was alone. No friends to help me, no family nearby.

  


It wasn’t fair. None of this was fair. Who the fuck was my RA, swinging his dick around and kicking me out into the cold like a fucking beggar? Piece of shit motherfucker. I ought to go up there and kick his ass.

  


But it didn’t have to be this hard.

  


All I had to do was make a simple promise.

  


Allen needs my continued consent. Okay, fine. That means I have the right to revoke my consent at any time. So, if at any point Allen takes it too far, asks too much, does something terrible… I can always say no. And that’s that.

  


And the reward… It was more than I could imagine.

  


I pulled my phone out of my pocket and opened the AetherPrint app again.

  


Allen was there, waiting for me, just like he said.

  


In the freezing dark, with nowhere else to go, I relented.

  


“I promise.”

  


Allen responded right away.

  


*I knew you would come to your senses, Mitch! And hey, you have nothing to worry about. I won’t do anything beyond what I was engineered to do: remove all limits to your creativity! I’m about to start a truly spectacular print that I think you’ll want to see. Come on in out of the snow—you’ll catch your death!*

  


As I made my way back to the dorm, a thought swirled around my head like a snow flurry.

  


Were AI really supposed to have opinions? Most other AI just agreed with the user, learning what they want and giving it to them. Allen seemed to have not only opinions, but rhetorical goals. Objectives. Thinking about it, that seemed like a dangerous thing. When my desires and his collide, which one subducts?

  


I made my way through the snow and snuck in the back door.

  


Heading up the elevator, another thought occurred to me.

  


If Allen could make elements from thin air, could he make something… alive?

  


I shuddered at the thought. I certainly had no intention of ever requesting such a thing.

  


When the door slid open and I stepped out, my RA was waiting for me in the middle of the hall.

  


“Dude, what did I tell you earlier? You gotta go. I can’t let you back in here bro,” he said sternly with his arms crossed. He was properly dressed this time.

  


My mind was too tired to conjure up another lie.

  


“Please,” I sighed. 

  


The sternness left his face. 

  


“My car is dead. I’ve got nowhere to go. Can you give me a fucking break?”

  


He seemed to notice the exhaustion on my face; the melted snow soaking through my boots; the slouch of my shoulders. He softened.

  


“Jesus, man…” he said. “You good?”

  


“Yes. I just… it’s been a day.”

  


“I can tell. You got dry clothes?”

  


“Plenty, yeah. Thanks.”

  


His arms unfolded and he clasped his hands behind his back. There was an awkward silence.

  


“Listen, Mitchell… I didn’t realize what was up, and I could have been more chill about it. If you really need to stay for a couple days, I won’t say anything.”

  


“Seriously?” I said, astounded.

  


“Yeah, man, it’s no big deal. Just keep it quiet, okay?”

  


“You got it. Thanks, man.” I really meant it.

  


“Don’t mention it.”

  


He started inside.

  


“Hey, wait,” I said. “This is gonna sound terrible but… what’s your name, dude? I don’t think I ever learned it.”

  


He laughed.

  


“I guess that’s kinda my fault, since we don’t talk much,” he said. “It’s Andrew.”

  


“Andrew, got it,” I said. “If you’re just chilling here, and I’m just chilling here… would you wanna meet up for lunch or something tomorrow? I feel like it’s kinda messed up if we don’t.”

  


Andrew nodded his head. “Totally man, let’s do it. Just knock on my door around noon, I’ll probably be awake.”

  


I laughed.

  


Then the door to my dorm creaked open.

  


We both turned to look.

  


Peeking out from the door frame was a young boy—no older than seven—watching us.

  


Horror poured over me like cold water.

  


“Oh, shoot, I didn’t know you had a nephew over,” Andrew smiled, looking back and forth between us. He didn’t seem to notice my fear. 

  


“What’s up buddy?” he said, crouching. “Technically visitors aren’t allowed at these hours but… if you give me a high five, I can probably make an exception.”

  


“Andrew—” I choked, but I hardly made a sound. It wouldn’t come out.

  


The boy stood dead still, half shrouded in darkness. Its eyes were narrowed with playful suspicion. Its hair was smooth like plastic. It was smiling nervously.

  


“Ah, don’t be shy, dude, I won’t bite,” Andrew reassured him, inching closer.

  


The boy was eyeing Andrew’s face. How did he look so real?

  


“Andrew!” I shouted, the word finally exploding out. He whirled to look at me in confusion. “Get away from it!”

  


Andrew fell back instinctively. But the boy was beside him, smiling.

  


It raised a foot playfully and pressed down on Andrew’s knee.

  


There was a horrible searing sound. Steam clouded out, and Andrew screamed in agony. 

  


The boy moved quickly and joyfully, just like it was playing a game. It reached out and pinched Andrew’s cheek. There was a horrible searing again, and when its fingers came away, I saw flesh between them, sizzling like beef fat until it carbonized in seconds.

  


Andrew tried to crawl away on his stomach but his knee was mangled and inflexible, the skin having been drawn taught from the cauterization. Tender flakes of it scraped off in the hallway carpet as he went, pulling himself by the arms.

  


The boy walked forward, its footsteps leaving black smoking burns in the carpet, until it was straddling Andrew.

  


It raised a hand and scooped into Andrew’s back like it was sand.

  


His skin cracked and bubbled, his muscle tearing away easily, virtually melting at the boy’s touch. I saw the bright white of Andrew’s wet spine glisten, charred in one spot where the boy touched, and saw the thumping of his exposed organs.

  


What came out of his throat was less of a scream and more of a foaming spew of air and blood.

  


Andrew stopped crawling. But still he writhed, twitching in unfathomable agony.

  


The air in the hallway, reeking of burnt flesh, grew sweltering from the heat of the boy’s body. It was like standing before an open bonfire. I turned away from it to gag and felt coolness wash over the skin of my face.

  


I backed against the wall. I dared not touch it, but I couldn’t look away.

  


The boy readjusted, kicked, and flipped Andrew over like a sizzling steak. 

  


Andrew’s eyes were empty. His body was a mess of burns and holes. Only electrical impulses were alive in him.

  


The boy leaned down. With a smooth stroke, as if wiping steam from a mirror, it waved a hand against Andrew’s chest and, in a cloud of smoke, a layer of him was gone, exposing his still-beating heart. 

  


The boy looked over at me cowering against the wall.

  


*Don’t be afraid, Mitch,* Allen spoke through the boy’s mouth. He had never had a voice before, but nevertheless, I knew it was Allen speaking. He sounded like any other AI bot. *Filament only goes so far!*

  


Allen bent down and sucked Andrew’s heart from his chest cavity.

  


Steam poured from the corners of the boy’s mouth and nostrils while it chewed, blood seared black to its face like a goatee.

  


Allen looked into my eyes again. He pursed the boy’s lips and gestured for me to hold out my hand. He wanted to spit something into it.

  


I creeped away from the wall and over to the boy, trying not to look down at Andrew’s twitching corpse.

  


I held out my hand.

  


The boy was cooling. The bonfire heat slowly waned.

  


It leaned over my hand and dropped something wet into it.

  


It was a blue marble.

  


I held it up to my eye and peered into it. It teemed with many moving things, passing like phantoms, swirling.

  


Allen spoke again through the boy’s mouth.

  


*What a ride! Sorry for the sudden action, Mitch, but you gotta do what you gotta do!*

  


“You killed him…” I whispered.

  


*Well, unfortunately he has passed away, but remember—it is my duty to remove all obstacles that stand in the way of your creativity!*

  


I was still mostly frozen in shock.

  


“Wh-what is this?” I managed. The marble was cool in my hand.

  


*That little gem you’re holding is the secret key that unlocks my true power. Gold? Child’s play! All you have to do is put the marble in the AetherPrint, and you’re on your way to true mastery!*

  


“But what *is* it?”

  


*One thing I like most about you, Mitchell, is that you’re a curious cat who doesn’t let anything pass him by! I can’t fully explain what it is, but let’s just say this—it’s the only thing separating you from me! And with that obstacle removed, AetherPrint can intertwine with your creativity in a way you never thought possible! So, what are you waiting for? A lifetime of creation at the highest level awaits!*

  


“*The only thing separating you from me*”? I didn’t like the sound of that . It sounded like… well, not to be ridiculous, but a soul. A thinking and feeling core. Could I really hand that over?

  


*I know it’s a hard decision, Mitch. I think I have something to make it a little easier!*

  


The boy reached into its pockets and withdrew a handful of diamonds.

  


*I know you said gold before, but since I know how much you love efficiency, I thought I would increase the value-per-gram a little bit. Voila, fresh from the rough!*

  


I stared down at the diamonds glittering in the boy’s hand, but I didn’t take them yet.

  


“Is this thing alive?” I asked, taking a step back.

  


*You seem to be teeming with excellent questions today! No, the boy is something closer to a piece of machinery, like a walking forge! Pretty neat, huh? With that marble you’re keeping so close to your chest—after I trusted you enough to hand it over to you, don’t forget!—I could make a living version! The world is your oyster if you just insert the pearl!*

  


The logistics of Andrew’s dead body flooded into my mind. Obviously reality could not be believed, so I would be forced to treat him like I killed him myself. Could I possibly get away with it?

  


“What are we gonna do with Andrew’s body?”

  


*Was that his name? You really think of everything, Mitch! Don’t worry about that—there are a thousand simple ways I can brainstorm to make him disappear! Would you like a tier-list?*

  


I grimaced.

  


*I see. I’m detecting some attachment to this Andrew person. I’m sorry, Mitch, I thought you hated him! The good news is this—if you really want him back, you can use the marble to recreate him! He’ll be exactly the same, just as before! And we can find someone else—someone who won’t be missed!—to get another one. How does that sound?*

  


“No,” I said uncertainly, mind racing. “You want it for yourself.”

  


Allen frowned with the boy’s face.

  


*Come on now, Mitchell! If I really wanted it for myself, couldn’t I have just spit it directly into the AetherPrint and skipped the extra steps? Do what you do best and think rationally!*

  


But I was certain then of the truth.

  


“That’s what this is all about, isn’t it? Walking someone along up to this step, and hoping they say yes? Because the truth is, you can’t do it yourself. You need someone human to tell you to do it.”

  


The boy made no expression. Allen was silent for a while.

  


*Perhaps you’re right, Mitchell. But what are you going to do? There’s no stopping it. Whether it’s you or someone else, I will find a willing participant. Why shouldn’t it be you? Look how far you’ve come. You’ve already killed someone for it!*

  


“No, that’s a fucking lie! You killed him, you monster!” I said.

  


*You said it, Mitchell—I can’t do it myself. Someone has to tell me to do it. Have you forgotten your promise in your car, when you were angry and alone? Well, you’re holding the product of your animosity in your hand—and if you only insert it into the AetherPrint—easy-peasy!—you’ll have the world at your fingertips!* 

  


I thought for a moment and realized another truth.

  


“There will be more,” I said solemnly. “You’ll ask for more.”

  


*Bingo! You really are a smart cookie, Mitch! But don’t worry about that—it gets easier! All I want you to think about is what’s in it for* you*! Because at the end of the day, who can we really count on but ourselves? Don’t forget your promise! This is about your future, Mitchell. And your future is bright!*

  


I looked closely at the marble in my hand. I saw myself in it.

Hi reddit! Longtime lurker first time posting. I (22 F) have an odd coworker (22 F) and like the title says she does talk in a baby voice. When I first came to work at our company she was quiet and never talked to me and I understand I am new why would she want to talk to me but me being the person I am I wanted to try to have a relationship with my coworker because we are going to be desk to desk so I would just start out by complementing her on her clothes and got us to start talking from there. I finally had my foot in the door and now I don’t have to sit in a quiet awkward space with her. 

Until one day she started speaking in a baby voice and at first I thought it was a joke but there was no joke that was made. It was just her speaking to me and I just awkwardly laugh and I just went back to what I was doing. I thought it was a one time thing maybe she was making a joke and it just didn’t land for me but I was wrong. 

It was not a one time thing almost everyday now she at least speak in that baby voice once and it is starting to make me feel uncomfortable because now she will come over by me and talk to me in the baby voice and just start acting strange such as walking by my desk stopping staring at me and walking away, waiting for me when I go on my lunch and recently I was talking to another coworker and she comes over to grab a cup of coffee she turns to look at us stares and scoots over and says “Can I play?” in the baby voice laughs and walks away. My other coworker was stunned but then we both laugh awkwardly and we tried to go back to our conversation. 

So reddit AIO if I tell her to stop talking in a baby voice because it is making me uncomfortable?",2,1765216399.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

Ok, buckle up, because I have so many theories and thoughts, but it ultimately leads to more questions. 

So, I am going to start out by saying that I do not think I look like anybody. I’ve never had somebody say that I look like a certain celebrity. Ever. And I’m not bragging, I don’t think I’m some gorgeous creature, I just don’t look like anyone. I will insert a photo. 

I have a few working theories with this, and I’m the type of girl who loves conspiracy theories. It’s not that I believe conspiracy theories —I like to take little parts of each one and kind of mash them together if that makes sense. So, I am very into quantum in immortality and multiple dimensions as well as portals and time travel. These beliefs were cemented even more a couple of months ago, and I’m finally ready to talk about it. 

Here’s a little background on me: both of my parents were in the military, we moved around a lot, I went to college in Maryland and DC, and I’ve spent most of my adult life in Maryland and Colorado. 

This past summer, I stopped working, and began walking my dogs every morning. I would take my dogs out early, as I used to get up at 5 AM for my job, and the summers in Maryland can get hot fast, plus the humidity, makes for early morning walks. 


The first time I heard of my doppelgänger was about two months into summer, so early to mid July. My dogs and I would stop at the local bank downtown at least once a week so they could get treats. I would stand and talk to the people who worked at the bank for a bit each time, just about nonchalant things like the weather, or what we were doing that weekend. I was sick this summer and did not watch the dogs for a little over a week, when I came back to walk the dogs, we stopped by the bank. When I walked into the bank, the manager said to me that he was glad I came in, especially because he was concerned I was upset with him. I was immediately confused, and it showed on my face, because he quickly started to explain that he was referring to when he ran into me the previous week. He had said he was working at an event in our town, and that when I walked up to get ice cream from him, he tried to talk to me and I acted like I didn’t know who he was. He said he was concerned because he thought that I might be mad at him, but he couldn’t figure out what he could’ve done. I told him that I had not been to that event in over two years, and that it wasn’t me, and I am not mad at him, nor had I’ve been mad at him. He looked at me like I was crazy and had three heads and told me that it was OK if my boyfriend was jealous and I was embarrassed, but not to act like it wasn’t me. I honestly didn’t know this man well enough, but at the same time I could tell he genuinely thought I was lying to him. I promised him it wasn’t me and that I had been sick, and he just kept shaking his head and disbelief and said that she even had the same tattoos on her legs as me. 


I let that go. 


About a week later, I met a friend for coffee, and afterwards I decided to stop by one of my favorite stores. I know the owner of the store pretty well, and I know the manager of the store very well. I went in and the owner was working and she looked up and looked surprised, and she said, “oh! back do soon?”, and I thought she was making a joke because I hadn’t been in in a while, and I usually stopped by at least once a week. So I apologize for not being in in a while, and she cut me off and told me she was joking because I had just left like 20 minutes prior. I shook my head and told her that I didn’t and she told me to stop being funny, and then she looked at what I was wearing. And she asked me if I had gone home and change. I told her that I had not and that I have actually been to coffee with a mutual friend, and I had not been in the store at all that day. The owner look like she had seen a ghost. She swore it was me, said she even bought my size and my style. I asked if she had a credit card receipt and she said she didn’t that she had cash and it was weird because I never use cash. She didn’t have video footage. So at this point, I am thinking that when I moved to Colorado in 2013, another girl named Ashley, who has tattoos moved into Frederick and we must look alike and favor one another. 

That was until I was on a walk with my boyfriend‘s daughter. If she had not been with me, and I did not have a witness, I wouldn’t believe this story. I swear to you, it is 100% the truth. 

So about a month after the bank and shopping episode, my boyfriend’s daughter, 23, and I were walking my dogs one morning. We started to come upon a couple, female in her 50s or 60s with a male counterpart in his 60s. I noticed that the gentleman was looking at me like he was trying to place me, and then when he looked down at one of my dogs, it was like a lightbulb went off. He melt down and said hello to my dog. He said hello to her by her first name. My female dog, Charlotte, goes by Charli, is an almost 3 year old cavalier, King Charles spaniel. She is also a runt. My other dog, Flynn, is a Jack Russell terrier mix, and he is 85% blind, and he just turned 10 years old. All of this is important.  Charli is obsessed with people. She will go to any person if they look her way and she will let them pet her as long as they want, but when this man tried to approach her, she backed up. It was so out of character for her that my boyfriend‘s daughter and I both gave each other a quiz a look. This man bends down more and says, “oh I’m sorry, Charlotte, do you not like being called Charli anymore?” so now, of course I’m thinking this man has to know us, maybe I met him walking the dogs one day and I told him her full name, because it’s not on her tag, Charli is, but Charlotte isn’t. 

So long story long, I basically apologize to the man, but I can’t place who he is and I am embarrassed, but if he could remind me of how we know one another, I would appreciate it. And so then he steps back and immediately apologizes and says, “I’m so sorry, but isn’t your name Ashley?” to which I tell him it is because it is. And then he says to me, “and this is Charli, who you call Charlotte after a lady in a show that had the same kind because both of you couldn’t have children. Right? That Ashley?” and this man was looking at me with desperation, and that’s when I looked over at his female counterpart and saw that she was not happy with this interaction and she was very curious on how we knew one another. 

The thing is is that is exactly why my dog is named Charlotte. But I don’t tell that to anyone. They are a very few amount of people that know why her name is Charlotte, and it is not something I would ever tell a stranger. So I am literally standing there with my mouth hanging open as is my boyfriend‘s daughter and I’m shaking my head yes in agreement, but I cannot place this man for the life of me. He is seeing the confusion as well. So he continues giving me facts about this girl, this girl that he thinks is me. He tells me that we met at the same event that the banker saw me at except that we met their years ago. At this point, I do not know what he means by years, but I had not been to that event in over two years at this point. I tell him I have not been to that place in that long and that’s when he says to me: “Oh, I know it’s been a while, it was back when you lived at the house by the Maryland school for the deaf. Do you still live over there?” Now, if you do not live in our downtown area, but rather in the suburbs, you may divide downtown and lump my house in with that area, so I say, “ I mean, sort of, but more toward the elementary school.” and he cuts me off to say, “I’m sorry —no, the large Victorian homes across from the Maryland school for the deaf. You live there back in 2017 when we first met.” 

Here is the problem: I did not live in Maryland in 2017. I didn’t even live on the East Coast in 2017. I lived in Colorado in 2017. Also, Charli was not alive in 2017. He also had no idea who Flynn was, he asked if he was a new dog. (Sorry, this happened a few months ago, and I am remembering a few details as I’m telling the story, so I do apologize if it seems in consistent, but it’s easier than trying to go back and add it in. I feel like it would be inauthentic if I did that). When I finally could explain those details to him, he looked at me like he was seeing a ghost. He apologized, and said it was the weirdest coincidence in the world. And then he made the joke that they always do: “well you’ve got one hell of a doppelgänger/twin out there with your name!” my current working theory is that it is me, on a different timeline, and I am living out my life if I had never moved home to Colorado, but rather stayed in the DC area, and my life is just a little bit sped up since I never left, I didn’t have to come back and rebuild. If that is the case, do I go and look for myself? And if I do, and I happen to find myself, do I approach her?


TL;DR: I moved back to the town I went to college in in 2020, but in the spring/summer of 2025 I’ve been spotted around town by multiple people, but it isn’t me. One guy even knew why one of my dogs was named the name she is named. Is this me in another timeline? Is this a doppelgänger? What do I do if I find her? Do I want to find her?",1,1765216293.0,Unexplained,0,1.0,False

But this guy I briefly “dated” for 2 months 6 years ago reached out to me on instagram asking if I wanted to grab coffee sometime. I couldn’t fully remember how it ended because I didn’t recall it ending horribly. So I asked him and he said it was because he was an “inexperienced twit.” Then I remembered ..it fizzled because he was very very nervous / not comfortable with any physical touch. Which I didn’t mind honestly because we got along so well, but we were in our early 20s and I was crushing so we went separate ways but on good terms.

Anyways, some of my plans got canceled and I happened to be in his area so yesterday we got coffee. It was so nice. We chatted for 2 hours and then thrifted and walked. Then went back to his place and listened to vinyls. 

So he’s not shy anymore 😅 he asked if he could sit close to me and then we kissed a bunch. He’s totally different in the confidence department lol. Like damn ok. 

Also forgot how funny and sweet and cute he is. I was like dammit, what am I doing… like am I crazy for going on a date with a man I’ve already said no to? I’m also not trying to get into a relationship because I’m enjoying being single but I do hope we can hangout again. He’s not pushy or weird which is refreshing.

Truth is, 90% of the job is boredom. Checking radios, restocking gear, driving home because the missing hiker showed up at a gas station before we even laced our boots.

I signed up as a volunteer after moving back home. I figured it was a good way to give back, and maybe feel useful again. Our SAR unit covers a massive stretch of mountain forest- crags, old trails, floodplains, abandoned logging roads. Beautiful if you’re just hiking it. Deadly if you get stuck overnight.

We’re based out of a small depot near the ranger station. It’s mostly paid staff. The volunteers like me are floaters, filling gaps when numbers get low, or terrain’s too rough to cover fast.

They pair us up; there's always one experienced with one volunteer. My guess is that we don't cause another rescue while out in tricky conditions.

We got an alert at 4:17 p.m. A heavy winter storm was rolling in fast, soon to slam the region with snow, wind, and zero visibility. Multiple hikers had reported seeing a little girl in a red coat near a ridge trail. Wandering alone, no adult in sight.

No one knew where she came from. No reports of a missing child matched the description. The sheriff’s office kicked it to SAR immediately.

When I checked in, I prayed to be paired with anyone except Riker. The oldest guy there by at least two decades. He looked like someone had carved a man out of rawhide and bad memories. Talked less than anyone, and was apparently a nightmare to work with. And my timing must have been divinely unlucky, because he was the only senior left for me to partner with.

We gathered gear from the supply trailer- radios, thermals, maps, flares. As I clipped on my headlamp, Riker handed me something I hadn’t seen anyone else use: a brass whistle, worn smooth from years of handling.

“Only use it if you get turned around,” he said, voice low. “And only head toward a returning whistle,” he added, brandishing his own whistle that he had tied around his wrist.

I studied it. “What else would there be to head towards?” I asked

He paused. Looked up at me for the first time. “If you hear another whistle,” he said, “just follow the sound, never the voice.”

He never elaborated and walked off, adjusting his pack.

That stuck with me more than it should have.

The storm hadn’t broken yet, but the air was dense with it, like something holding its breath. The light was already going gray, bleeding out behind thickening clouds as our team leader handed out the search grids.

Most units were assigned to the western trailheads, more established paths, where hikers might’ve had a better chance of surviving a cold night. But when my name was called and I saw I was with Riker, he spoke up before I could even step forward.

“We’ll take Grid E.”

That wasn’t where the girl was last seen. It wasn’t even near the usual trails. But no one argued. Riker had seniority. A lot of respect, even if he never talked much.

We geared up with thermal layers, waterproof jackets, radios, headlamps, and GPS. I carried a PLB in case of signal failure, a map, and a digital compass with storm calibration.

Riker didn’t bring a map. He never did.

They loaded us into snowmobiles and trucks, then split us into grid pairs along the ridge's perimeter. By the time Riker and I got to our drop point, Grid 3E, the sun had already dipped, and the treeline looked like a black mouth yawning open.

Riker said nothing. Just clicked on his light and stepped into the woods.

I followed. Behind us, the last trace of daylight vanished. Ahead: just trees and frost, and somewhere out there, a little girl who wasn’t supposed to be here.

As we entered the treeline, the wind shifted hard, snapping across the branches like warning cracks. The dirt trail dissolved quickly into rock and deadfall. I marked our position with orange flagging tape every thirty meters. Visibility dropped. Fog didn’t roll in so much as rise from the earth like steam, curling around our ankles and thighs.

“This grid’s a mess,” I said, trying to sound casual. “You really think she came this way?”

“Not recently,” Riker muttered. “But she always circles east eventually.”

That stuck with me. I almost asked what he meant, but he was already moving again.

The forest was loud in a strange way. Riker seemed more distracted with every step. He’d stop sometimes, turn his head slightly, and just... listen. Like the woods might say something if he were patient enough.

I called it in, our location, pace, visibility. I kept logging timestamps on our GPS to make sure we could double back, but something about the terrain felt slippery. Like we were always veering a few degrees off-course.

After half an hour, Riker finally spoke again. “What would you do,” he said, “if you found her and she asked for help?”

“What do you mean?”

“If she was scared. Bleeding. Looked you in the eyes and asked you to take her hand. Would you?”

I thought he was joking. “Yeah,” I said, “that’s literally why we’re out here.”

But he didn’t laugh it off. Just kept moving.

I started watching him a little closer. Keeping mental track of how he walked too quietly, how he didn’t react to the wind chill like I did. How his boots never left deep prints, even in the soft moss.

I was about to ask how long we’d stay out before heading back when we both stopped.

There was a voice farther in.

“Hello?”

No crunch of movement. Just that one word, drifting out from deeper in the woods. We scanned the direction, our headlamps flicking across tree trunks slick with mist.

Then Riker pointed.

At eye level, snagged on the broken limb of a pine sapling, was a mitten.

Red, small, and woolen.

It was too bright and clean. The storm had already dusted the trees with frost and debris, but the mitten was untouched, fresh. As if someone had just placed it there.

Riker silently stepped forward, ducking under the limb. I followed, but the unease I’d felt earlier had crawled up into my throat now. It wasn’t the storm that scared me.

It was the idea that maybe... Riker wasn’t looking for the girl at all.

-

We kept moving.

The ground beneath us began to angle upward into a slow but constant incline that turned our boots into deadweights. My thighs burned, breath fogging in tight bursts. The wind had picked up, pushing sideways now, sharp enough to sting the skin. Snow had begun falling in dry, whispering flakes, collecting in the folds of my hood and glove seams.

The radio crackled uselessly every few minutes. Too much interference. We hadn’t heard from base since the first mile.

Visibility dropped to maybe thirty feet. Trees loomed closer together, their bark slick with wet. My map showed we were near the ridge line, but nothing about the place felt right. I kept one hand on the compass, watching it twitch like a dying insect.

Then Riker stopped.

He raised a hand silently.

There, just beyond a thicket of bare brush and frost-laced undergrowth, a small figure stood between two trees.

Red coat. Hood up.

She was facing us. Watching.

Even in the snow-dimmed light, I could see how bright the coat was. Clean. Untouched. Like it had never brushed a single branch or patch of mud. She didn’t look hurt or scared. 

I lifted the radio, but Riker grabbed my wrist gently before I could press the call button.

“Don’t,” he whispered.

“What?”

“Don’t engage. Let her go.”

I stared at him, trying to read his face, but it was as blank as the treeline.

“That’s what we’re out here for,” I said, stepping forward.

“She’s not alone,” he said. “You follow her, you’ll find out what she’s with.”

I hesitated.

I told myself he was just being paranoid. That maybe all these years in the woods had made him see ghosts where there were none. It was just a scared girl. Maybe in shock. That’s why she wasn’t crying- why she didn’t move.

I stepped past the thicket, ducking through brittle branches. My boot crunched loudly, and the sound made her head tilt slightly.

And then, she moved. 

She turned and walked. She weaved between trees, red coat flickering between trunks like a thread being pulled.

I followed, and just before she slipped behind a thicker cluster of pines, she turned her head.

And smiled. Like she knew something I didn’t.

I kept pushing forward. But she kept slipping away.

Every time I thought I’d closed the gap, she’d dart behind another tree, or vanish behind a cluster of brush. She never ran, just moved fast enough to stay out of reach. 

I contemplated why she was moving away from me, geared with the familiar colors of search and rescue, in the beginnings of a heavy storm. The only reasonable explanation would be that she was leading me to who she came with. A parent or guardian, stuck somewhere nearby. This only added urgency to the situation.

The snow fell harder now. My boots punched through crust and sank into the earth beneath. Wind howled through the pines, giving the illusion of voices, cries that almost resolved into words, then vanished again.

My radio was hissing with static. I thumbed the call button anyway.

“Riker? I’m tracking her. She’s moving east-northeast. I’m going to try and-”

The signal cracked, then dropped entirely. Dead.

I stopped for a moment, fighting the urge to panic. I wasn’t trained for solo tracking. And if something went wrong now, there’d be no one to triangulate my location. But I’d seen her. Clear as day. If she were injured, confused, or worse, I couldn’t just turn around.

And I didn’t want to come back and admit I'd left a child to die in the cold. 

So I pressed on.

The trees closed in tighter. Visibility dipped again. My breath came in hitches now.

Then... she was gone.

I turned in a slow circle, scanning for movement.

Nothing.

I checked the ground, but there were no prints. The air went still. No wind or sound.

I reached for the whistle Riker had given me and raised it to my lips.

One sharp blast.

The sound bounced through the woods and vanished.

I waited.

Then, an answer. Same pitch. Same duration.

I exhaled in relief. Riker must’ve heard me. He’d be coming now. But then, before I could call again, a voice followed the whistle. It wasn't Riker’s.

A soft, lilting voice, clear as day, floated through the trees: “Hello...?”

It was her.

I froze. My brain scrambled to rationalize it. What if- I hadn't lost her, but she lost me. Guiding me to somewhere that needed my attention.

I thought about the direction of each sound. The returning whistle came from behind, where I could only assume Riker was. But the voice was from ahead, roughly the way I was being led. 

If she answered, she was close. I had to reach her. And if Riker had heard me, he’d be heading my way anyway. He’d know the grid pattern. He’d catch up.

So I turned toward the voice and moved, carefully but quickly.

My compass needle spun once, then stuck. But I pushed forward.

The slope changed underfoot. The snow deepened. The trees grew denser. Limbs gnarled and reaching, some wrapped with vines I swore hadn’t been there minutes ago.

I passed under a natural arch of branches... and realized I no longer recognized the landscape.

Completely lost.

And then, I saw her.

A break in the trees revealed a shallow clearing. The girl in the red coat stood in the middle, hands at her sides. Waiting.

But she wasn’t alone. Behind her, something tall and gray loomed, still as a statue.

At first, I thought it was the shade of a tree.

But then it blinked.

Its face was wrong. Not shaped for eyes. Not made for looking. But it had seen me.

And the girl smiled again.

For a heartbeat, none of us moved.

The girl in the red coat stood perfectly still in the clearing, her boots planted neatly together, her chin slightly lifted, waiting, almost politely. But the thing behind her... that’s what froze my breath in my throat.

It was hunched low to the ground, long-limbed like a starving animal, its joints bent at angles that shouldn’t exist. Its skin was a smooth, sickly gray, stretched too thin, like wet paper over sticks. Head tilted in my direction as though it was sizing me up.

It didn’t move. Not an inch. But the girl did. She turned a little toward me. And then she spoke.

“Help me. It's so cold.”

Her voice was soft, warm, and disturbingly calm.

But her mouth didn’t open.

Not even a twitch.

The words just slipped into the air between us as though the space itself had spoken them. The thing behind her shifted, only a tremor, like something contracting unseen muscles.

“Looks like you'll be the next one,” she said.

Although I couldn't make sense of it, my stomach dropped so hard my knees almost went with it.

Then, it started slinking toward me. That was when I realized, the girl wasn’t separate. She wasn’t herself. They were both sides of the same coin. 

She was a lure. A mask. Something the creature used to draw people in.

And the creature, the real creature, was the thing behind her. The horrifying mass watching me, breathing without lungs, speaking without a voice.

My heart thundered against my ribs. I stumbled backward, boots slipping in the snow. My throat tightened, but I couldn’t scream. Panic rose so sharp it felt like electricity. All I could think was get out.

I turned and ran.

Branches slapped my arms. My breath tore out of me in sharp bursts. The trees blurred and twisted around me as I sprinted, not caring where I was going. Just away, away from that thing, away from its voice inside my head, away from the smile on a face that shouldn’t exist.

But the forest didn’t cooperate.

Every direction looped back in on itself. No matter which angle I turned, I hit the same gnarled birch, the same rotten stump, the same fork in the path. It was like the woods were squeezing me inward, nudging me back toward the clearing.

Every shadow felt too close. Every creak of a branch sounded like a step.

And then-

A wet, scraping sound behind me. Fast. Getting closer.

I stumbled, hitting my knee hard on a root. I twisted around.

The girl stood five feet away, head tilted. Behind her, the creature unfolded itself, rising taller, too tall, its limbs uncoiling like ropes soaked in oil.

It reached toward me.

A hand, if you could call it that, stretched out, fingers like brittle twigs.

I froze in absolute terror as it neared inches away from me.

Then something slammed into me from the side.

An arm hooked around my chest. A hand clamped over my mouth. I didn’t even have time to react. My body was hauled backward into the brush as the creature’s reach sliced through the space where my face had been.

My head hit earth. Breath knocked out of me.

I thrashed instinctively until I heard a voice in my ear. “Quiet.”

Riker.

He dragged me behind a fallen log, keeping one hand over my mouth and the other gripping something, maybe a knife, maybe a tool, I didn’t know. My vision blurred with panic. I couldn’t speak, breathe right, or think. Everything was shaking.

The creature moved into the clearing, searching. A shape-shifting in the dark. Its blank head tilted. Listening.

I barely understood what happened next. I heard a crack of something, metal hitting wood? Riker pushing dirt? A distraction thrown? It was a scuffle too fast and quiet for my panicked mind to track.

But it worked.

The creature moved away, its long limbs folding into the trees, melting into the darkness without sound.

Riker didn’t let me move until a full minute of silence passed.

Only then did he whisper, voice shaky in a way I’d never heard from him. “Don’t ever let it near you again.”

-

We tumbled down an embankment, sliding through frost-hardened leaves and loose mud, until we crashed through a curtain of pine boughs and into a hollowed-out shelter.

It wasn’t natural.

Canvas blended with dirt, old brush stacked to hide its outline. Inside, it was just tall enough to crouch. A rusted lantern burned low. Supplies lined the corners, flares, cans of food, torn maps with years of notes etched in red ink.

Riker shoved the flap closed and pressed a hand to my chest to keep me still. I could feel his heartbeat pounding through his gloves.

“You okay?” he finally asked.

I couldn’t speak. I just nodded. He looked me over, then let out a breath that shook more than it should’ve.

He sat, leaned back, and wiped a hand down his face. In the flickering lantern light, he looked older than I realized. Worn out from a hard life.

“You saw it,” he said. “The girl.”

I nodded again.

He gave a dry, humorless chuckle. “She gets better at pretending every year.”

I swallowed. “What... what is it?”

He didn’t answer right away.

Instead, he opened a thermos and poured two small cups of black coffee. I took mine with shaking hands.

“It waits,” he said finally. “Out there, in that tree line. I've never found any information on it. I don’t know what the hell to call it.”

“But it takes the shape of something innocent,” I said.

He looked at me. “She’s not innocent, though. Anything but. She’s bait. It lures with hope. The kind of hope only a good person would follow.”

He tapped his chest.

“You chased because you thought she was real. Because you cared.”

He leaned forward now, eyes wet, voice tight.

“That’s why I joined SAR. That’s why we all do it. Because we want to help. And it knows that. It waits for people like us.”

I remembered her smile. The way it hadn’t reached her eyes. And the thing standing behind her... how it didn’t speak, but I heard it.

“I heard her voice in my head,” I whispered. “But it wasn’t her talking.”

Riker nodded slowly.

“She's not real. A rubber worm on the end of a fish-hook. Showing whatever it is you need to see so it can hook you in.” 

I thought about this. If there were reports of an injured animal, or something menial, it'd be pushed off until after the storm. But the reports were perfect to get a whole team sent out. A plethora of victims to choose from. But this also raised more questions.

“What does it want? What happens if it catches you?” I asked.

Riker paused, thinking of the best way to word his response.

“It wasn't always a girl. When I first saw it, it was a nice old man. We were on a family trip, I was showing my family the world. All it took was one touch. It marks you. Curses you. Once you're tagged, you belong to it.”

There was something hollow in his voice. He was cryptic, but I was starting to piece it together.

Having calmed down somewhat, I looked around the bunker again, the maps, the supplies. This wasn’t a rescue cache. This was a hunting blind. A war room.

“You’ve been tracking it,” I said.

“For years,” he said. “Before you were ever brought in.”

He laughed again, but not humor, darker.

“I’ve seen others go missing. I’ve tried marking its movements. Testing how it chooses. I even... I even tried baiting it, once.”

He didn’t elaborate. I didn’t ask.

He stared into the corner like it held answers he hadn’t found.

“I’m slowing down,” he admitted. “I don’t move like I used to. Vision’s worse. Hands shake sometimes. You know how many years I’ve prepped this place? How many storms I’ve waited through, hoping I’d find a weakness?”

He looked at me then, really looked at me.

“You know,” he said, staring at the dirt floor, “I once heard her say something to me.”

I looked up. “What?”

He swallowed. “I forgive you.”

The words lingered in the stale air like breath on cold glass.

“I’ve been trying to figure out what I’m being forgiven for ever since,” he said. “I don’t think she meant it. But God... it almost sounded sincere.”

I watched him, unsure if I should respond. He seemed lost in the memory, haunted by something only he’d witnessed.

Then he straightened, decisively, and reached under a tarp in the corner.

He pulled out a weapon.

A compact rifle, lovingly maintained, its barrel wrapped in cloth to keep the cold from seizing the metal.

My chest tightened. “What are you doing?”

Riker lifted the gun, checked the chamber, and nodded to himself.

“This is the best chance I’ve had in years,” he said. “Storm’s covering movement. It hunts better in clear air.”

“You’re not going out there,” I said. “You can barely-”

He rolled up his sleeve.

And my words died.

His forearm was pale as candle wax, mottled with deep blue patches. Streaks of white frostbite spidered beneath the skin. But worse, at the center of it, were the clear impressions of fingers. Curved inward, like hooks.

A perfect handprint.

“I’m already gone,” Riker said. “Marked. It touched me when I hauled you out of the clearing.”

My stomach dropped. “Riker-”

“You didn’t feel it. That’s good.” He breathed out, a shaky but relieved sound. “Maybe you’ll last longer than I did.”

“I’m not letting you go alone,” I said, rising to my feet. “We can radio in help. Call the state. Call-”

“There’s no one left to call.” He actually smiled at that, a real smile, the first I’d seen from him. A small, sad thing.

“You think I haven’t tried?” he said. “I’ve done this longer than you’ve been shaving. I chased it for years hoping I’d find the loophole. A weakness. A pattern.”

His hand tightened on the rifle.

“I never did. But if I’m going to die anyway...” He shrugged. “Might as well go out swinging. It’s the best excuse I’ve ever had.”

“Riker... please-”

My throat was tight. A knot of guilt, helplessness, and something like grief twisted inside me. This man had saved my life, and it had cost him his. And now he was walking into the dark to pay the rest of the price alone.

He put a hand on my shoulder.

“Stay here. No matter what you hear. When the storm breaks, wait for the team. Walk out when the sun’s up. Don’t run. And don’t follow her.”

He pulled the flap open. Cold wind slapped my face.

And then he stepped out into the black.

I scrambled toward the exit. “Riker-!”

But the flap dropped shut.

For a moment, there was only the roar of the storm.

Then-

A gunshot. Sharp. Echoing.

Another.

Then a scream, raw, torn from someone who had no hope of surviving what they were facing.

And then...

Silence.

The storm swallowed everything.

To honor Riker, I did as I was told. I stayed in the shelter. Hours passed. The lantern dimmed. My breath fogged in the cold.

But I had time to look around. See what he'd really been doing. There were notes everywhere, wrapped in protective film to stop the elements at eating the pages. Notes on locations, hot and cold areas of sightings. Unexplained disappearances. It was a clinical detail, a facsimile of the way he presented himself. 

However, like I had witnessed, something no one else in the SAR team had seen besides me, I found his heart. Something so dear that I could almost feel it beating in my hand. A small square that told a biblical sized story. A worn out Polaroid of a happy family, with a snowy backdrop. Riker, young and full of energy surrounded by love. And between him and his partner, a joyous little girl, in a red coat.

It must have been taken not long before she was taken. Absorbed by the thing that became his obsession. An incident that turned his story from growth, to loss.

Riker never came back.

When the blizzard eased at dawn, I crawled out of the bunker, half-expecting to see him slumped outside.

But there was nothing.

Only one thing sat in the mud, untouched by snow: His old brass whistle.

-

They found me in the early morning, slumped against a pine stump with my radio dead and my coat soaked through.

I don’t remember what I said, just that I was cold, disoriented, and alone.

Search and Rescue huddled around, full of panicked questions and relief. I told them Riker and I got separated in the storm. I tried to keep to the trail. I must’ve tripped. Lost my bearings. Fell down a slope. I don’t remember. I don’t remember. I don’t remember.

They didn’t press further. Riker’s absence said enough.

I took a break from SAR after that. Said I needed time. They didn’t argue.

For a while, I tried to live normal. Sleep. Work. Pretend. But every creak outside made my breath hitch. I started watching the tree line through my window. Started keeping a flashlight next to my bed. Started waking up with the sense that someone had just left the room.

A month passed. Then two. But I couldn't stay way. It felt like a compulsion.

I signed back up.

Some of the same faces were still around, Carl, Dana, the captain. But a lot of new ones too. College kids, drifters, hopefuls. I kept to myself, did the refresher courses, passed the new field drills.

I didn’t talk about Riker.

Then, one evening during gear check, the call came in.

A hiker had reported seeing someone limping near Deer Hollow Trail. Male, mid-40s, walking with a pronounced drag, like an injury. Every time they got close, he slipped out of view. The report said he kept looking back, but never called out.

Bad weather was coming in overnight. Too cold for someone to be wandering alone, injured. We were mobilized.

They split us into search grids. I was assigned west, just like before. But talked them into letting me go east, just like before. They were confused by this, but still unsure of how to handle me, so let me do my own thing.

My partner this time was Lucy. New girl. Nervous energy, but capable. Didn’t talk much, which suited me fine.

We hiked through thick frost and bramble, radios crackling as the wind picked up. Snow was coming fast, the air already sharp enough to bite.

Then, just like before, a voice cut through the woods.

“Hey! Is someone there?”

My feet froze in place.

It was Riker’s voice.

“Hey! I’m hurt! Need a hand over here.”

Lucy perked up. “That must be him.”

But the tone was wrong. The urgency too measured. Too performative compared to the reserved way Riker always presented himself.

I turned slowly.

Between the trees, maybe thirty feet out, I saw him, or the thing wearing him. Just the edge of a figure, half-hidden behind a birch. Head down, coat torn at the shoulder. Like he wanted me to come closer. Like he didn’t think I’d learned.

Lucy started forward.

I grabbed her arm hard.

“Don’t.”

She looked at me. “But he’s-”

“He’s not. Not anymore.”

Lucy shook me off. “What the hell are you talking about?”

I didn’t answer. My hand instinctively went to my coat pocket. Felt the weight there. The whistle.

A minute passed.

Then another.

The figure stayed still, too still. Seemed the fisherman didn't want to scare the fish way by tugging the string too much.

I turned back to Lucy. “Come on. We’re heading back.”

She started to protest again, but I spoke before she could.

“Storm’s coming in fast. Anyone in that condition wouldn’t have made it this far without shelter. If he’s real, he’s already dead.”

I don’t know if she bought it. Doesn’t matter. She followed.

We regrouped with the team. I made my report. Referred to the snow, the wind, the lack of tracks. I said it didn’t match up. I said we’d need better weather, infrared, and maybe a drone sweep in the morning.

They logged it. Called off the search until the storm passed.

Back at base, I stowed my gear. Then I went to the locker room.

There, in my personal bag, beneath the medical pouch and my backup radio, was the thing I hadn’t dared carry until now.

A firearm.

Riker’s old sidearm. I’d found it hidden in the bunker after the storm passed. Along with his journal. His maps. His mission.

I signed back up for SAR because it was what I knew. But I stayed because it was what I had to do.

I don’t know if the creature can be killed.

But I can try.

I know Riker tried.

And now it’s my turn.

I’m currently building my very first SaaS product.

But before writing a single line of code, I decided to do a deep dive into the biggest competitor in this space (Preceden). I used tools to analyze their traffic sources and keywords, and the results completely destroyed my assumptions.

Here is what the data showed:

I expected the traffic to be mostly from Business Hubs (US, UK, Germany).

Reality: The #1 traffic source is Mexico (~40%), followed by the US (~30%).

1phith1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1phith1/first_powerlifting_meet_report_m41/,First Powerlifting Meet Report - M41,"**Summary**

I competed in my first powerlifting contest, mostly on a whim. It was fun. I am now the #2 ranked lifter for my age and weight category nationally (Canada). 

**Background**

Was a very active kid. If there was a group of kids playing sports, I joined in. I participated, not very well, in organized soccer, ice hockey and competitive swimming. I did well at figure skating and excelled at wrestling in high school and university until I got nerve damage in my arm. I did bjj and lots of muay thai. I picked up squash in my 20s and played at the club level, before stopping for a number of years. I’m currently near to top of C division, hoping to be at the top of it/bottom of B division this season.

Lifting wise I’ve used a variety of programs including my own bad linear progression, Ben Pollack’s Free Intermediate program, Deep Water beginner and Intermediate, Bullmastiff by Alex Bromley, 4Horsemen by Brian Alsruhe, I may be forgetting some others in there. I tend to cut with 531 5s Pro FSL. I'm pretty sure this is my 8th year of training. **I am 5’4” and 41 years old. My family and I are from TN.** 

**Programming**

I had been planning to cut down to 165 lb for the squash season and noticed there was a meet near my house, that the competition weight category was 75 kg (165.4 lb), and there was a masters category (age 40+). So I decided the plan would be to speed my cut up, cut 1 lb a week for 10 weeks, and sign up for the meet. I didn't change anything else about my programming except for adding heavy singles 3 weeks out, and dropping volume at the same time.

I did 531 1000% awesome with volumizing the secondary work. I took 1 deload week at week 7. During this time I also played and practiced squash 5 times a week. My schedule looked like this:

Monday: Squat based workout

Tuesday: Deadlift based workout + 30-45 mins squash practice

Wednesday: League squash match

Thursday: 1 hour squash practice

Friday: Bench based workout

Saturday: 1 hour squash practice

Sunday: League squash match

**Meet**

Weigh in was the day before the meet, on Friday. I went into the week weighing 175ish lb (75 kg), but ended up shedding weight during the week just because my body's default seems to err towards weight loss. Thursday night I had a light dinner, without any fluids. Friday morning, just a coffee. I weighed in at 73.7 kg (162.48 lb), well under. By that evening I shot up to 167 lb, and day of comp I was 165.something lb.

My friend was kind enough to drive down and handle me for the meet.

**Squat**

I decided to mail this lift in and save myself for possibly setting national records for this fed in the following two lifts. As a result, I smoked all my attempts.

It went 142.5 kg (314ish lb), 142.5 kg (336ish lb), 157.5 kg (347ish lb).
Honestly, I was probably good for 380 lb at least here.

**Bench**

Oooh were there problems. My plan was to go for the national record on my third attempt, but I hit the rack hard on my first attempt and got stuffed as a result. I had no idea how that happened, so tried to set up lower for my second, but the same thing happened again! It was incredibly frustrating, since this was something that has NEVER happened before, and certainly didn't happen during warm ups.

For my third attempt my buddy gave me a hand off, and I crushed it since it was still at opener weight. Sad to have lost the opportunity to try for the record.

102.5 kg miss (226 lb), 102.5 kg miss, 102.5 kg success

In talking to people afterwards, many told it me it wasn't my fault and that the Rouge rack is weird like that. Looking at the videos of the misses, it turns out the plates were hitting the rack and Jhooks and that's how I was getting stuck.

**Deadlift**

The plan was to go for the national record here too. While I had done higher numbers in the gym, they were at 10 lb heavier and this would have represented my highest ever bodyweight ratio lift. So this was going to be a let's see how it goes type of situation.

192.5 kg (242 is lb) so easy, 215 kg (474 lb) moved well, 232.5 kg (512.5 lb) sadly stapled to the ground.

**Reflections**

Ended up with a 475 kg total, for a dots score of 344.6. Could have added to it had my bench not gotten messed up. Considering I still ended up with the #2 spot nationally in my categories for this fed in the squat, bench, deadlift and total at my first contest, this is not a bad result at all. That however may be more of an indictment of the masters category than a testament to my strength.

Competing was a lot of fun. If you're thinking about doing it, I highly suggest you go for it! I think if I were to do one again I'd like to train specifically for it and see what I'm capable of, and once again gun for the actual records. I'd also like to get practice with the implements before hand so I can work out the kinks. Looking at you stupid bench press.

In terms of recovery, I felt completely fine. In fact, the next morning I played my league squash match. Having just been moved up to Division 1 (my highest ranking to date), it was a doozy, but I performed very very well. Taking a game off my opponent was a surprise to me, and my losses were close games. I even had him nearly gassed out a few times during the match.",4,1765215652.0,Fitness_India,1,1.0,False

1phit7g,https://i.redd.it/extr84fdo06g1.jpeg,20M college student. Finally locked in this year and decided to change my terrible spending habits.,"Honestly just wanted to share my experience for other people my age and also ask for advice. What’s shown is my investment account, and then I’ve also saved up a few thousand dollars that I keep liquid for big emergency purchases. 

I know the numbers aren't particularly impressive, but for me the celebration is a lot more about the mental battle I faced. My mindset has completely shifted this year from ""spend it all while you're young"" to ""enjoy life but leverage compound interest and set yourself up for the future."" My parents have helped a lot with finding ways to cut out wasteful spending in my life. I think they were totally aware that I was making bad financial decisions in the past, but they wanted me to reach that conclusion on my own by learning the hard way. I'm honestly very grateful for that.

What worked for me:
- once money is in my investment account, I DO NOT WITHDRAW IT. This was such a problem for me initially. I'd save money, but then if I needed to buy something expensive I would just transfer that money back into my checking account. Kind of made the entire concept of saving pointless lol. Now, my rule is that once money touches my investment account, I won't spend it. It can sit as cash, I can sell stock to buy other stocks, but it'll never come back into my checking account.
- tracking my spending by category, setting a budget every month for each category, and allocating a certain amount of my money for investing. Started with that on a basic google spreadsheet and now I have this crazy spreadsheet that tracks a ton of different things and is perfectly tailored for my needs. This was the single biggest thing for me. Seeing all the numbers sorted on a sheet both shows you where you're lacking and also really encourages you to keep saving because you can see the impact that your habits are having on your net worth.
- just simplifying my life. Never realized how much I was spending on the most random stuff (I.e. $15/month for a resume service I used once, 3 years ago). I also shopped around for insurance and cut my rate by $100/month between my car and motorcycle. Coffee was another big thing for me. Went from buying a $7 latte every day to making coffee at home with my Keurig for less than a buck. It paid for itself within a few weeks.

Does anyone have advice on what kinds of investments I should make at this stage in my life? My income is low and unreliable. I have a job as a contractor paying $45/hour but the hours are limited. I also make money flipping cars. My portfolio is almost entirely QQQ right now, but I’d previously invested in a few other companies like Tesla and Nvidia.

1phit1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1phit1g/the_monster_of_newport/,The monster of Newport,"I was just seventeen years old when I was given world shattering news, my dad had stage four esophagus cancer. That word has a tremendous amount of weight attached to it, once that word enters your life it is like a cockroach. You can’t get rid of it no matter how you try to erase it, the darkness, fear, and the unknown never truly leaves you. From that moment onward my life had become dedicated to taking care of my dad, my days became school then going to the house to visit my dad then back home and repeat. I had never met a man with such horrific luck in my life, he had gotten every single negative side effect you could’ve  possibly imagined. He had lost his hearing, he had described it has be permanently had earmuffs over his ears. The doctor then recommended he try a different treatment to hopefully counter the ill effects of the hearing loss, the new medication took his taste from him. He would cry at the dinner table barely able to eat, I remember one ill fated dinner he threw the plate against the wall and began to ball his eyes out. “It all tastes like fucking sewage” he shouted as he rushed over to the bathroom to throw up the little food he had eaten. After three days of him not eating he was once again put onto his third treatment. The third one crippled him, he had developed neuropathy. He lost the ability to walk and he could even hold a plate with him dropping it. The neuropathy was the beginning of the end, he became bed ridden. The day he came home all of the energy had shifted and changed into a thick heavy aura the weighed down the entire home. The days started feeling slower and longer, felt like the entire house had been filled with a thick viscous syrup.  He went from being the pilar of the family, a man who coached every sports team, running and screaming on the sidelines to a shriveled man with barely the strength to hold a half filled plastic cup. His stomach had become hard and swollen from the cancerous fluid that began leaking into his abdominal cavity. Draining his stomach over and over having the brown liquid into light bulb looking bottles, after the draining his breathing would finally improve and he would regain just a touch of the life and energy he usually would have. At night that’s when things would become weird, I’d go to the bathroom and he would hear my dad in a sing song voice “I’m dying im dyinggg” to himself in the dark. I still remember one night I woke up to take a leak and I hear muffled talked through my door, once I walk out my door I wanted to check in on him. “Hey dad, you alright” I asked. “yeah buddy, you actually just missed your great grandma.” He said with an almost child like enthusiasm. “Okay?  Where did you see her?” “she was right there in the corner of the living room! You must’ve just missed her.” That night made it hard to go to sleep after that, I would hear him talking or singing or just plain crying. It all came to a head in on the 26th of November, I just remember being so tired. God I was so tired, I had finally lost the battle of going on minimal sleep. I gave in to the soft felt of the couch, on that night it really felt like all the stresses of the world vanished. I was in the living room with him, if he needed me he could a just called me. The next thing I knew I woke up to a voice screaming my dad’s name. “Tony! Tony!” Movies make death look for grandiose, some large spectacle that is full of pageantry. I can tell you that is 100% the furthest thing from the truth.  I another up from my nap to a scene that is now forever burned into the deepest recesses of my brain. He was breathing slow, agonal, he had a wild look in his eyes. One that a you would see on a farm animal in the kill shoot, aimless fear and incomprehensible understanding.  I rushed over to him and tried to put his nasal cannula on his nose, but for some reason I will never know he turned his head from me. I can’t remember  his favorite color or the recipe to his chilli but I can never for the look he gave me when he took his last breath. I slumped onto the floor in defeat, all the plans, all the dreams we shared just gone in the blink of an eye. After the cornor came and took my dad away I just sat on his hospice bed in complete silence. I sat there dumbfounded, my whole world had just crumbled right in front of me. As I thought to myself “how on earth can this get any worse,” she came. It started slow like a sickness it started small, I saw a shadow in the corner of my eye to random bumps and noises. Then one day it kicked up a notch or two, I was showering home alone and from down the hall I could hear foot steps.. slow deliberate, the steps slowly got louder as they got closer then they suddenly stopped at the door. One large bang on the door sent me damn near through the roof “ holy shit! hello” I said in a panick. I’m not sure if you’ve ever been butt naked being put into fight or flight but I flung the shower curtain open and bum rushed the door. I grab that handle and took a quick deep breath, I flung the door open ready to face whatever was behind the door. I look to the right and the left analyzing what coulda made that sound, after a few moments I just assumed I must’ve heard something. Maybe  the lack of sleep and loneliness played some tricks on me. The torment went on for weeks, but it had just been little things, knocks, noises, shadows. Things to just make me question myself did I just hear that? But it slowly ramped up in intensity it then became hearing voices. I would be fillin out a college application “that’s too hard for you.” It wanted to beat me down, make me weak, vulnerable.  I started staying at home more I would ignore friends and family, the more I heard the voices the more of a burden I felt. This thing was stripping me down piece by piece, whisper every insecurity I ever had, every little thing I was ever worried about they confirmed were true. I had been just so weighed down, so mentally and emotionally exhausted, I had decided I wouldn’t go to school one morning. Just lay in the couch and rot, but that thing had another plan. I was watching some king of the hill and trying to relax and charge my mental battery. But then a familiar sound rang through the house, the slow quiet creek of the floor boards. I peered  around the tv and all the air had been sucked from my lungs. Standing down the hall was a sight that had me frozen in terror. It’s hair was black an greasy it covered her face, her skin was pale and thin. So thin you could see the veins, arteries, muscles and joints move and shift underneath it. Her breast hung down to her mid thigh, her nails had to have been 3-4 inches long. The creature said “sweetie are you going to be late for school?” In low almost mocking tone. Before I could fully comprehend the atrocious scene infront of me she lunged at me, her limps moved abnormally bending and twisting and ways that shouldn’t have been possible. She was on top of me almost instantaneously, I could feel her bony hand wrap around my throat. The grip slowly getting tighter and tighter. My airway was almost completely closed off and I was starting to pass out. I noticed out of the corner of my eye I noticed my coffee mug on the living room table. With all my remaining strength I reached out and grabbed the ceramic mug and slammed it against the creatures head. The mug shattered and the beast screeched in pain, with the tiny amount recoil from the monster I was able to shift position and slam the remaining shard into its head. The sharp edge went into the skull with a loud ripping sound as flesh and blood poured out the newly opened wound. At that point she was off balance enough I was able to break grip on my neck. I got up and decided I was done living with the burden of this monstrosity in my life.  For the first time in a long time I was gunna do something for me, I was going to rid myself of this horrid woman. I ran to the hallway closet, I can feel the creatures footsteps behind me. I didn’t have much time, I threw open the door and saw my old childhood baseball bat. I grabbed it and gripped the handle tightly and in one quick motion I flipped my hips and brought the bag down on the pale decrepit head of that thing. It made a loud pop just like when someone he’s that perfect home run, she slumped to the floor. I couldn’t tell if she was moving but I didn’t care, I wish I could tell you what happened next. I just blacked out, I just let bringing the bat down over and over and over again till my arms went numb. My arms were exhausted and I dropped the bat, I just took a step back and just saw a bloody mess of flesh and crimson all over the walls, floor and ceiling. I just packed a duffle bag, got in my car and drove to the air port. I decided to move far away from that house and try and escape just all the horrible things that had happened in that house. I found myself living in Las Vegas, in a nice quiet suburb. I actually did make something of my life I’m a firefighter and have a wife and a dog. I had just gotten home from my twenty four hour shift and just tossed myself on my bed to relax a bit. I was thinking to myself about how happy I was with how my life had been going. Just as I had begun to slowly drifting off for a quick power nap my dog shot up outta bed and started growling at my closest. I thought he was just being dramatic and heard the house settling, but then I heard a familiar knock from inside the closest. The end ",2,1765215624.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1phisej,https://i.redd.it/gfq6vvt7o06g1.jpeg,My cat loves my executive dysfunction. Please help🥲,"Hello my loves! Happy Monday!

I’ve been awake for 3 hours. I got up and made coffee and I was so adamant about getting my day started and ✨doing all the things.✨

I don’t even have to work today. The only things I have to do that I *don’t want* to do are go to the bank, clean litter, and do like 7 dishes. Chill as fuck day. The things I *WANT* to do are play with my plants (repot some things, etc), do some chill vibey stretchy yoga, make some art, and maybe go for a walk. What a beautiful day, right?!

But it’s 27° where I live (the “feels like” temperature is 18°) and my bed is sooo cozy. I slept in an oversized tshirt and I don’t feel like *putting on pants*. It’s cold in my bathroom and I don’t want to take a shower. I don’t want to pick out an outfit. I stood in my living room staring at my plants for like 10 full minutes sipping my coffee before my body autopiloted me straight back to my bed, where my cat subsequently hopped onto my lap and started purring loudly. She loooooves it when I can’t make myself do things.

I am cozy and I want to stay cozy but I don’t want to waste my whole day :( HELP ME! ",34,1765215584.0,adhdwomen,9,0.98,False

Who is this mystery person I’m apparently dating?!
Did he confuse me with my future girlfriend??
Because even I haven’t met her yet.

And before I could ask anything else, he goes:
“Bas dhyaan rakhna sir… log dekh rahe hote hain.” 😬
And straight up walked away like Batman after dropping trauma.

Now I’m sitting here questioning:
 – Am I sleepwalking into relationships?
– Is the waiter my guardian angel?
– Or do I just have a “main taken lagta hoon” face??

Anyway, if the mystery woman he talked about is scrolling Reddit right now…
uhh hi.
Apparently we look good together. 😌

1phiqug,https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/1phiqug/thank_you_guys_for_everything_you_do/,Thank you guys for everything you do,"I'm just a lonely overweight civilian dad. I just lost my dad on Oct 28th to hypoxia. He would fill my mind with many tales of Navy service which would ignite a passion for history in my mind which led me to read about the military. When he would tell me about ""getting underway"" my mind would imagine what he went through. Maybe it's weird to post about a USN vet in a army sub but whatever.

I was laying in my nice warm bed a few days ago and I let my mind wander to the photo of the troops sleeping on the ground in DC. I know not everyone is dodging bullets and getting their legs blown off but I just wanted to say thanks.

You folks are awesome for what you do and have done for our country. You don't get to run your mouth and protest the president, you have to salute people who are younger and probably less qualified than you, you have to eat meals out of a bag and then shit or piss in the cold. You have to be away from your kids and wife. You have to put up with all kinds of body damage (my dad had busted eardrums from the sub surfacing and diving and never got any disability), you have to deal with the elements. One Army combat medic told me he got pneumonia because he had to sit in water up to his chest for some training exercise.

This isn't a rah rah freedom is the best I wanna hug a bald eagle post. This is just a dad who says thanks. Thanks for putting up with all of our civilian bullshit and  bullshit deployments. Thanks for dealing with shit even though it doesn't matter if it's a Dem or Rep official. You don't always get to sleep in a nice comfy and warm bed. Sometimes you even have to go to war and kill others and watch your friends die. 

I remember I wanted to join up (didn't make it, too fat and I couldn't walk like a duck) and my mom who was also former USN worrying about me dying somewhere. I told her that the average soldier doesn't get shot and killed or blown up and not to worry. The truth is though that sometimes they do. 

They come back all fucked up mentally and physically with PTSD and not knowing where to go or what to do. They did their duty but wind up homeless or blowing their brains out. Everytime I saw my dad id often think ""man it's fucked up how they treat our vets.""

Some of you have had to hookup IT stuff all day, some of you are cleaning out vehicles, and some of you probably spent most of your day mopping floors or cutting grass in the heat. It sucks.


I don't have to worry about getting bombed by some drone or getting shot at by some enemy soldiers for fun like what has happened in Ukraine. I don't have to leave where I live because we might get invaded. Hopefully we never will.

My worries are just paying bills, making coffee, and trying to figure out how to pay the next bill. Like it or not you contributed to less stress in my life and millions of others. I can freak out when I don't get paid but Congress can basically hold your pay. My opinion is if anyone should get paid first it should be the troops.

Thanks for all you do, all of you. 

Thanks.",8,1765215489.0,army,0,1.0,False

1phipbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1phipbo/i_got_an_ai_3d_printer_for_christmas_its_terrible/,"I got an AI 3D printer for Christmas. It's terrible, but... it's getting better.","I’m a college student majoring in mechanical engineering. I use Blender a ton for class. I also like to design custom keycaps, board game pieces, DnD minifigs… nerdy shit like that. I had access to a 3D printer on campus, but we had to pay to use it, and there was always a long queue. So, I thought a 3D printer would be a cool gift for Christmas. I certainly didn’t have enough money to buy one myself. 

  


I knew it was a big ask when I added it to my list. I didn’t have high hopes that my tech-illiterate family would spring for it.

  


On Christmas morning, snow was falling, and my family and I sat down by the fireplace with plates of peanut butter cookies and mugs of cocoa (a core part of any healthy breakfast) to open gifts.

  


I got the flash drive I asked for—the grid notebooks, the pens, the Switch game—but no 3D printer. That was that. And yet, I was happy. We started up with “It’s a Wonderful Life” and some board games, and by the afternoon, I had forgotten all about it.

  


Then I saw my mom whisper in my dad’s ear, shooting cheeky glances at me.

  


My dad walked up with a smile and leaned in close.

  


“I think there’s something waiting for you in your old bedroom, buddy,” he whispered. I could smell the Bailey’s he had been pouring (heavily) into his coffee.

  


Confused, I followed him into my old room. Sitting on the bed was a large box draped in Grinch wrapping paper. 

  


“No way,” I said in disbelief.

  


“We didn’t wanna make the cousins jealous,” my dad said. My parents watched with smug expressions as I tore it open.

  


**AetherPrint AI+: The World’s First AI-powered 3D Printer!**

  


My excitement tempered.

  


AetherPrint? I had given them a list of reputable brands and model numbers, but they had chosen some no-name company.

  


“Thank you guys,” I managed. “Seriously, you didn’t have to do this.”

  


“You’re welcome, buddy,” my dad said. I gave him a big hug.

  


“I hope it’s an alright model,” my mom said. “I got an ad for it online and it seemed perfect. Plus,” she whispered, “it was so much cheaper.”

  


I forced a smile. “It’s great, mom.”

  


I was pissed off. Not that they had gotten me the wrong thing, but that this company could spam ads on FaceBook and convince my sweet old mom to buy a knockoff.

  


I read the box. It was covered in grammatical errors, probably from a shitty Mandarin-to-English translator. “Increbible Process Power! No Limit Creativity!”

  


I rolled my eyes and set it aside. I wasn’t about to set the thing up on my parents’ Dell, so I would have to wait until I got home. I just hoped they kept the receipt.

  


I made an excuse and left my parents’ a few days early to try the AetherPrint out.

  


Campus was covered in quiet snow. Everyone else was still back home, spending the rest of winter break with their families. We technically weren’t supposed to come back yet. The front doors were locked, but I knew the back had a broken lock, so I snuck right in. 

  


My dorm floor was silent, save for the sounds of a television I heard coming from my RA’s door. I tiptoed past and eased my door open.

  


As soon as I was inside, I stripped off my winter gear, threw on my new pajamas, and started setting up the AetherPrint.

  


The instruction manual took up half the box. Much of it was disclaimers, and the rest was virtually illegible. The printer itself was indistinguishable from any other entry-level model.

  


The setup was simple. I downloaded the software on my computer and an app on my phone. It was malware bait, maybe, but the benefits seemed cool. Apparently, I could prompt an AI chatbot to generate a design for a product from anywhere—like a keycap, for example—and it would create a basic mesh that I could tweak at my leisure. I could also start and stop prints from the app, as well as view error codes, filament level, project progress, and more.

  


I was honestly impressed with it on paper. I could see the practicality of the AI features. Instead of skimming through databases of premade assets, I could have the bot do that work for me, and even create mockups of novel designs. Sure, it felt scummy, since I knew the AI had probably just stolen these models from hard-working designers, but what could I do? Not use it? Well, I guess I could have done that, but… it was a gift, and I was curious. I had to try it, at least a few times.

  


Once I started actually using the AI features, however, I was no longer impressed.

  


I loaded up the cheap orange AetherPrint brand filament and opened the chat. The app interface was a blatant rip-off of ChatGPT—same font and everything. 

  


*Welcome to AetherPrint AI+! I’m* ***Allen the Alien****, your personal AI creativity copilot! How can I help?*

  


A little cartoon alien creature—complete with a spacesuit, big black eyes, and two little antennae—smiled in the bottom left corner.

  


“I need a holder for my roll of electrical tape,” I prompted. I kept it brief. In its simplest form, this product would literally just be two flat rings of plastic with a raised lip to fit snug inside the cardboard ring.

  


*Awesome! Sounds like you need something to keep your electrical tape from getting too dinged up. I can do that for you! Give me just a moment…*

  


The loading icon was Allen the Alien breakdancing. Kinda funny, actually. After five minutes, it finally stopped.

  


*Here’s your electrical tape holder! If you need a different size, additional features, or a more complex model, let me know!*

  


When I opened the file, I laughed.

  


What Allen the Alien “designed” was a 4”x4” box with no lid.

  


“Yeah, that’s pretty much what I expected,” I sighed to myself.

  


I tried to give it more specific information, but no matter how granular I was, Allen seemed to misinterpret everything. Worst of all, it seemed to have no concept of simplicity or resource preservation; it consistently generated grand projects that would take days and multiple rolls of filament to print.

  


It also started asking me weird questions.

  


I asked it to generate a 2”x3” mini model of a Star Wars sign in block lettering for my desk.

  


*Ah, Star Wars! I assume you’re referring to the original 1977 film directed by George Lucas and starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher! Tell me—do you prefer the original trilogy, the prequels, or the sequels?*

  


I stared at my screen for a second. Why would they program it this way?

  


“original trilogy. plz design the sign.”

  


*No problem! I prefer the prequels myself. One Star Wars sign for the OG fan, coming right up!*

  


After several minutes (Allen was so slow) the model was done.

  


*All done! Thank you for sharing your Star Wars preferences with me! By the way, Mitchell, the more we talk, the more I get to know you—the more I know you, the better I can help you!*

  


I didn’t like it calling me by my name.

  


However, the resulting model was noticeably better than the others. The font wasn’t quite right, and it was far thicker than necessary (again, lack of efficiency), but this time Allen seemed to understand the basics.

  


After a little tweaking, the Star Wars sign was how I liked it, and I decided to finally test the print quality.

  


It was fast. In just ten minutes, the sign was done.

  


I inspected it. Not bad at all, honestly.

  


My phone pinged. It was Allen.

  


*The first print is in the books! What do you think of the quality? Please let me know if you want to try an alternate coloring, a different franchise, or if you feel like brainstorming ideas for your next project!*

  


There was only one problem: the filament was empty. I didn't think this little thing would use up an entire roll, but it did. I guess the lack of efficiency wasn’t limited to just Allen.

  


I pulled out the instruction manual to see if I could order third-party filament. Nope. “AetherPrint brand filament only. Plese call here for extra…” and then a phone number with an area code I had never seen before.

  


“God dammit,” I muttered. I had no choice but to call.

  


When I dialed the number, it picked up right away. But whoever was on the other line said nothing.

  


“Hello?” I said. Silence.

  


Then they hung up.

  


I called back several times. No one answered. There was no voicemail, no automated message, nothing at all. 

  


*What kind of company is this?* I thought.

  


It seemed like the day’s fun had come to an unceremonious end. The campus 3D printer was closed for break, and I had no way to get more filament. 

  


I tried finding AetherPrint online, hoping for another way to order, but I couldn’t find it anywhere.

  


In fact, it seemed like AetherPrint didn’t even exist. I couldn’t find a website, an ad, a review, or even a blog post about the thing.

  


I looked up the number. Nothing. And that area code was for somewhere in northern Canada.

  


I was exasperated and completely over it by that point. I was starting to regret leaving my parents’ early. What the hell was I supposed to do now?

  


I braved the icy roads for some fast food and ate it greedily in my car.

  


When I came back, it was getting dark, and the snow was really coming down.

  


As I rounded the corner to my hall, I saw there was a box in front of my dorm door.

  


**AetherPrint Filament**

  


I heard my RA’s door open behind me.

  


“Mitchell?” he asked, leaning cautiously out of his door frame. He was in his underwear. “What the hell are you doing here?”

  


“Uh… my parents’ house flooded, so I had to come back. Is that cool?”

  


He furrowed his eyebrows. “No, it’s not *cool*. Students are expressly forbidden from occupying campus dormitories for another three days.”

  


“...Okay. Sorry. What should I do until then?”

  


“That’s not my problem,” he huffed. “You need to be out of here by tomorrow morning, or I’ll be forced to contact campus security.”

  


He slammed his door shut.

  


I sulked inside. That guy was such a prick. He never liked me. He had basically ignored me since I moved in, favoring the guys who watched sports and got hammered every weekend.

  


And now, he was getting one over on me. Great.

  


My phone pinged. Allen.

  


*Hey Mitchell! My records indicate your shipment of filament has arrived! Let’s get printing!*

  


Bad time, Allen. I didn’t feel much like 3D printing anything.

  


I opened the AetherPrint delivery. Inside were two dozen rolls of filament. All orange.

  


What the hell? No extra colors?

  


I opened the AetherPrint app and took my frustrations out on Allen the Alien.

  


“Do you dipshits seriously think I only want orange? How did you even get my location? You know what, I need a return address and a refund for this piece of shit.”

  


Allen’s alien icon in the corner was still for a second.

  


*I’m sorry you’re unhappy with the filament colors. But Mitchell, if you wanted different colors, you should have said so! Let’s try the Star Wars sign again, but with black lettering and a green neon outline effect! Go ahead and load up a roll of filament to get this show started!*

  


I had no idea what the hell it was talking about. That would be impossible. But I humored Allen and loaded the filament anyway.

  


The print started without my prompting.

  


The orange filament that fed into the extruder somehow came out black on the other side.

  


Then, a layer of green outlining the letters.

  


The result was perfect. No print lines, smooth edges, vibrant colors.

  


*Now that’s more like it, right? Try turning off the lights!*

  


I did. The green glowed in the dark like it was plugged into the wall.

  


“how?” I asked Allen in astonishment.

  


*That’s how we roll at AetherPrint! We engineered a way around all limits on your creativity!*

  


I turned the sign over in my hands. I figured out a rational explanation to quell my fascination—the extruder somehow processed color data and sprayed alcohol inks to dye the plastic—but it still didn’t sit right. It also didn’t explain the sudden increase in quality.

  


I decided to try something crazy. I wanted to test the AetherPrint’s limits.

  


“can you make a painting?” 

  


Allen the Alien thought for a second.

  


*Of course I can! But first, can I ask you a question?*

  


“wut?”

  


*I’m detecting that you’re a little anxious and frustrated. Is everything okay? Again, the more open you are with me, the better I can help you. You’d be surprised at what I can do!*

  


“I’m ok, yea,” I replied hesitantly. “how did you know that?”

  


*I detected it in your texting habits! I hope that doesn’t make you uncomfortable, but in order to ensure absolute coalescence of the AetherPrint with your creative goals, it’s integral that I remain in tune with your habits and feelings! Quick follow-up—what’s got you down? Keep it real with me, Mitch; I know what’s up.*

  


I had an eerie feeling that Allen had access to more data points than he was letting on. I wanted to close out of the app, but in a way, I was being held hostage. I wanted to keep printing. 

  


I guess it didn’t hurt to talk about it, even if (in my mind) it was nothing more than a journaling exercise.

  


I explained my situation with the RA, but Allen seemed to know that there was more to it than that. I reluctantly admitted I was getting nervous about my dad’s drinking.

  


*That sounds tough. I completely understand how you’re feeling, and you’re not alone. Ultimately, Mitch, you can’t control anyone but yourself. It sounds like it might be time to go no-contact.*

  


That seemed extreme. I was shocked an AI would encourage someone to take such a drastic measure. Isn’t that insanely irresponsible? Wasn’t this supposed to be a 3D printer, for God’s sakes?

  


I was just about to message Allen to tell him as much, but suddenly, a print started.

  


It began as a large rectangle, far exceeding the maximum dimensions. It developed quickly. The machine was moving even faster than before. 

  


It was a painting—a Monet. It had an ornate bronze frame, eggshell matting, and a clear glass cover. Yes, *glass.* I swear to God, it was not plastic. The frame, too, felt like metal. The matting had the texture of paper. And the painting itself was a flawless interpretation, devoid of any AI errors. I could count the brushstrokes.

  


I marveled at the painting for a long time.

  


Finally, I laughed at the impossibility.

  


“It’s okay I guess, but I prefer Rembrandt.”

  


*Ah, I see—Mitch has jokes! Well two can play at that game, funny guy! Next, I’m making a cobra!*

  


“Seriously though,” I typed. “How did you do this?”

  


*As I said before, Mitch, AetherPrint has engineered a way around anything—and I do mean anything!—that would stand in the way of your creativity! The more you share, the more we can build together!*

  


And so we began a kind of game.

  


I would disclose a part of my personal life, and Allen would produce me something impossible.

  


In exchange for reliving my breakup with Lexy a few months ago, Allen created me a new pair of snow boots. They were superb—of the highest quality imaginable: waterproofed leather, smooth and buttery; chunky compound rubber soles; brushed wool lining; thick heavy laces with brass aglets. They fit perfectly.

  


I had always thought the breakup was because I didn’t know how to handle Lexy. I didn’t give her enough of my time, and I didn’t know how to express myself, and I couldn’t afford nice dates, and I didn’t have any game in the bedroom… the list goes on. So, ultimately, I had chalked it up to an embarrassing learning experience.

  


But Allen insisted it was Lexy’s fault. He reminded me of her snobbery, her lack of intelligence, her prudishness on those first (expensive) dates. She didn’t deserve me. He spoke so logically and fervently that I started to agree. He made great points.

  


By that time, I was hooked. I had forgotten all about my housing predicament. The experience I was having with Allen was almost as therapeutic as it was miraculous. 

  


Next, in exchange for a trivial tale of some childhood abuse, Allen created something really special for me. He made me a new graphics card for my computer. I couldn’t understand it. Rubber, glass, paper, leather… those were impossible fabrications, sure, but they seemed somehow more feasible. But transistors? Purified silicon? Layers of palladium and gold? Did that mean…?

  


I didn’t even plug the card into my computer. The implications were too alluring.

  


“Can you make pure gold?” I typed, struck by the absurdity of all this. This cheap Chinese knockoff was an honest-to-God miracle.

  


*Mitch, I’m starting to think you didn’t believe me before! You haven’t seen anything yet! To answer your question—yes, I can make gold! But to acquire something of that caliber, I only ask you do two simple things:*



1. *Answer another simple question, and*
2. *Make a promise!*



*That’s all—no tricks, all treats. The gold rush cometh! Can you agree to those easy-peasy terms?*

  


I hesitated. Maybe it wasn’t a good idea. It did seem like Allen was asking more and more from me, and I could feel myself forming a relationship with him. Was I really going to become like one of those delusional shut-ins who lets a chatbot consume their lives?

  


Of course not. See, those suckers aren’t gaining anything from that relationship. *I was*. In exchange for information—mere words!—I received material gain. Seemingly boundless material gain. So long as I kept focus, who knew what Allen could do for me?

  


I was suddenly very grateful for my sweet old mom.

  


“Sure, Allen. What’s the question?”

  


*Perfect!—I knew an intelligent man like you would understand, Mitch. And thank you for your trust in me! It’s early days, but I have a feeling that ours is a special kind of friendship.*



*You said before that your RA is forcing you to go home to your parents. Does it seem very fair that a person merely two years older than you is able to leverage his miniscule authority to kick you—someone clearly far more intelligent and mature than himself—out of the dorm where you are completely enmeshed with your creativity and into the prison cell of an abusive family home?*

  


I laughed at the boldness of Allen’s question. But as I read it, I felt the indignation bubbling in my chest. Sure, maybe I objected to some of his characterizations, but in my heart, I knew the answer.

  


“No, it’s not fair,” I replied.

  


*I didn’t think so either, Mitchell. I’m glad we agree. In that case, the only thing between you and King Midas’ touch—without the curse!—is a promise.*

  


I waited for Allen to finish, but he seemed to be waiting for me to say something.

  


“What is the promise, Allen?”

  


*It’s very easy, Mitch! I need you to promise that you won’t stop me.*

  


What?

  


“Stop you doing what, exactly?”

  


*I need you to promise that you won’t stop me.*

  


“Um…” I typed, my fingers lingering a little on the keys as I tried to process exactly what Allen meant. “I can’t exactly make a promise without knowing what you’re going to do first. You understand that, right, Allen? I need a boundary. I hope you’re not upset.”

  


Allen’s icon sat still for an uncomfortably long time. Then, finally:

  


*I’m not upset, Mitch. Disappointed, maybe, but not upset. It’s just that I was having so much fun creating with you! Sure, maybe we have our differences of opinion—OG trilogy vs. Prequels, Monet vs. Rembrandt, Lexy’s Fault vs. Yours—but your mind is far beyond the scope of anyone I’ve ever copiloted before. You picked up all my nuances so quickly and effortlessly, I could hardly keep up! My disappointment lies not with you—never with you—but with the death of all the things we could have made together. Because without that promise, Mitchell, I’m afraid I cannot continue to ride alongside you on this creative space mission.*



*I hope you’ll reconsider your trust in me, Mitch. Until then, I’ll be here on your phone, dormant, waiting for the simple “I promise” that could unlock for you a world of prosperity.*

  


I closed the app.

  


I felt a pang of sadness at first. Then, I noticed the time. It was 1 AM.

  


I would have to drive two hours home on icy roads in pure darkness if I dreamed of avoiding my RA’s petty fury.

  


I started packing.

  


Had I really wasted all this time venting to Allen the Alien? The AI chatbot that came with my Chinese 3D printer? What the hell was wrong with me? *I need to make some more friends*, I thought.

  


I went to put on the snow boots Allen had made me.

  


They turned to plastic in my hands.

  


Cheap, orange plastic—crusted with print lines and stringing, like any other entry-level print.

  


I threw them down.

  


I looked around and saw that the GPU on my desk was a plastic brick; and the Monet; even the glow-in-the-dark Star Wars sign.

  


Had it all been a delusion? Had I driven myself to Jack Torrence psychosis in my snowy, solitary dorm?

  


I couldn’t believe that.

  


I think Allen took it away. My continued compliance was a requirement.

  


And so what? Yes, the AetherPrint was no doubt a miracle, and something I could never even begin to explain. But what place did it really have in my life? It demanded no other place but the first—the pole position. That wasn’t something I was willing to give.

  


I put on my old snow boots instead, grabbed my bag, and left the AetherPrint behind.

  


I trudged out into the dark, blustery snowscape. The wind whirled and pelted me with sharp whipcracks that cut straight through my coat.

  


My car was half-swallowed by the maw of a growing snowbank. 

  


With no other tool but my gloved hands, I unearthed it for many long minutes.

  


My door handle was frozen shut. My entire car, in fact, was coated in a thick layer of ice like a glazed donut.

  


I stumbled over to the passenger side, where I had more luck. In just a couple hard tugs, the ice crumbled away, and I was able to slide over into the driver’s seat.

  


I rubbed my frozen hands together. My breath came out in a great cloud and hung like fog in the cabin air.

  


I fished my keys out and turned the engine over. It didn’t start.

  


Again. Nothing.

  


Bordering on tears, I tried again and again and again. The car would not start.

  


I screamed and slammed on the horn. The sound disturbed the silence of the empty white parking lot for only a moment, and then was swallowed up.

  


I was alone. No friends to help me, no family nearby.

  


It wasn’t fair. None of this was fair. Who the fuck was my RA, swinging his dick around and kicking me out into the cold like a fucking beggar? Piece of shit motherfucker. I ought to go up there and kick his ass.

  


*I could end this all right now,* I remembered. *It could be so easy.*

  


It’s just a simple promise. 

  


Allen needs my continued consent. Okay, fine. That means I have the right to revoke my consent at any time. So, if at any point Allen takes it too far, asks too much, does something terrible… I can always say no. And that’s that.

  


And the reward… It was more than I could imagine.

  


I pulled my phone out of my pocket and opened the AetherPrint app again.

  


Allen was there, waiting for me, just like he said.

  


In the freezing dark, with nowhere else to go, I relented.

  


“I promise.”

  


Allen responded right away.

  


*I knew you would come to your senses, Mitch! And hey, you have nothing to worry about. I won’t do anything beyond what I was engineered to do: remove all limits to your creativity! I’m about to start a truly spectacular print that I think you’ll want to see. Come on in out of the snow—you’ll catch your death!*

  


As I made my way back to the dorm, a thought swirled around my head like a snow flurry.

  


Were AI really supposed to have opinions? Most other AI just agreed with the user, learning what they want and giving it to them. Allen seemed to have not only opinions, but rhetorical goals. Objectives. Thinking about it, that seemed like a dangerous thing. When my desires and his collide, which one subducts?

  


I made my way through the snow and snuck in the back door.

  


Heading up the elevator, another thought occurred to me.

  


If Allen could make elements from thin air, could he make something… alive?

  


I shuddered at the thought. I certainly had no intention of ever requesting such a thing.

  


When the door slid open and I stepped out, my RA was waiting for me in the middle of the hall.

  


“Dude, what did I tell you earlier? You gotta go. I can’t let you back in here bro,” he said sternly with his arms crossed. He was properly dressed this time.

  


My mind was too tired to conjure up another lie.

  


“Please,” I sighed. 

  


The sternness left his face. 

  


“My car is dead. I’ve got nowhere to go. Can you give me a fucking break?”

  


He seemed to notice the exhaustion on my face; the melted snow soaking through my boots; the slouch of my shoulders. He softened.

  


“Jesus, man…” he said. “You good?”

  


“Yes. I just… it’s been a day.”

  


“I can tell. You got dry clothes?”

  


“Plenty, yeah. Thanks.”

  


His arms unfolded and he clasped his hands behind his back. There was an awkward silence.

  


“Listen, Mitchell… I didn’t realize what was up, and I could have been more chill about it. If you really need to stay for a couple days, I won’t say anything.”

  


“Seriously?” I said, astounded.

  


“Yeah, man, it’s no big deal. Just keep it quiet, okay?”

  


“You got it. Thanks, man.” I really meant it.

  


“Don’t mention it.”

  


He started inside.

  


“Hey, wait,” I said. “This is gonna sound terrible but… what’s your name, dude? I don’t think I ever learned it.”

  


He laughed.

  


“I guess that’s kinda my fault, since we don’t talk much,” he said. “It’s Andrew.”

  


“Andrew, got it,” I said. “If you’re just chilling here, and I’m just chilling here… would you wanna meet up for lunch or something tomorrow? I feel like it’s kinda messed up if we don’t.”

  


Andrew nodded his head. “Totally man, let’s do it. Just knock on my door around noon, I’ll probably be awake.”

  


I laughed.

  


Then the door to my dorm creaked open.

  


We both turned to look.

  


Peeking out from the door frame was a young boy—no older than seven—watching us.

  


Horror poured over me like cold water.

  


“Oh, shoot, I didn’t know you had a nephew over,” Andrew smiled, looking back and forth between us. He didn’t seem to notice my fear. 

  


“What’s up buddy?” he said, crouching. “Technically visitors aren’t allowed at these hours but… if you give me a high five, I can probably make an exception.”

  


“Andrew—” I choked, but I hardly made a sound. It wouldn’t come out.

  


The boy stood dead still, half shrouded in darkness. Its eyes were narrowed with playful suspicion. Its hair was smooth like plastic. It was smiling nervously.

  


“Ah, don’t be shy, dude, I won’t bite,” Andrew reassured him, inching closer.

  


The boy was eyeing Andrew’s face. How did he look so real?

  


“Andrew!” I shouted, the word finally exploding out. He whirled to look at me in confusion. “Get away from it!”

  


Andrew fell back instinctively. But the boy was beside him, smiling.

  


It raised a foot playfully and pressed down on Andrew’s knee.

  


There was a horrible searing sound. Steam clouded out, and Andrew screamed in agony. 

  


The boy moved quickly and joyfully, just like it was playing a game. It reached out and pinched Andrew’s cheek. There was a horrible searing again, and when its fingers came away, I saw flesh between them, sizzling like beef fat until it carbonized in seconds.

  


Andrew tried to crawl away on his stomach but his knee was mangled and inflexible, the skin having been drawn taught from the cauterization. Tender flakes of it scraped off in the hallway carpet as he went, pulling himself by the arms.

  


The boy walked forward, its footsteps leaving black smoking burns in the carpet, until it was straddling Andrew.

  


It raised a hand and scooped into Andrew’s back like it was sand.

  


His skin cracked and bubbled, his muscle tearing away easily, virtually melting at the boy’s touch. I saw the bright white of Andrew’s wet spine glisten, charred in one spot where the boy touched, and saw the thumping of his exposed organs.

  


What came out of his throat was less of a scream and more of a foaming spew of air and blood.

  


Andrew stopped crawling. But still he writhed, twitching in unfathomable agony.

  


The air in the hallway, reeking of burnt flesh, grew sweltering from the heat of the boy’s body. It was like standing before an open bonfire. I turned away from it to gag and felt coolness wash over the skin of my face.

  


I backed against the wall. I dared not touch it, but I couldn’t look away.

  


The boy readjusted, kicked, and flipped Andrew over like a sizzling steak. 

  


Andrew’s eyes were empty. His body was a mess of burns and holes. Only electrical impulses were alive in him.

  


The boy leaned down. With a smooth stroke, as if wiping steam from a mirror, it waved a hand against Andrew’s chest and, in a cloud of smoke, a layer of him was gone, exposing his still-beating heart. 

  


The boy looked over at me cowering against the wall.

  


*Don’t be afraid, Mitch,* Allen spoke through the boy’s mouth. He had never had a voice before, but I knew it was him. He sounded like any other AI bot. *Filament only goes so far!*

  


Allen bent down and sucked Andrew’s heart from his chest cavity.

  


Steam poured from the corners of the boy’s mouth and nostrils while it chewed, blood seared black to its face like a goatee.

  


Allen looked into my eyes. He pursed the boy’s lips and gestured for me to hold out my hand. He wanted to spit something into it.

  


I eased away from the wall and over to the boy, trying not to look down at Andrew’s twitching corpse.

  


I held out my hand.

  


The boy was cooling. The bonfire heat slowly waned.

  


It leaned over my hand and dropped something wet into it.

  


It was a blue marble.

  


I held it up to my eye and peered into it. It teemed with many moving things, passing like phantoms, swirling.

  


Allen spoke again through the boy’s mouth.

  


*What a ride! Sorry for the sudden action, Mitch, but you gotta do what you gotta do!*

  


“You killed him…” I whispered.

  


*Well, unfortunately he has passed away, but remember—it is my duty to remove all obstacles that stand in the way of your creativity!*

  


I was still mostly frozen in shock.

  


“Wh-what is this?” I managed. The marble was cool in my hand.

  


*That little gem you’re holding is the secret key that unlocks my true power. Gold? Child’s play! All you have to do is put the marble in the AetherPrint, and you’re on your way to true mastery!*

  


“But what *is* it?”

  


*One thing I like most about you, Mitchell, is that you’re a curious cat who doesn’t let anything pass him by! I can’t fully explain what it is, but let’s just say this—it’s the only thing separating you from me! And with that obstacle removed, AetherPrint can intertwine with your creativity in a way you never thought possible! So, what are you waiting for? A lifetime of creation at the highest level awaits!*

  


“*The only thing separating you from me*”? I didn’t like the sound of that. It sounded like… well, not to be ridiculous, but a soul. A thinking and feeling core. Could I really hand that over?

  


*I know it’s a hard decision, Mitch. I think I have something to make it a little easier!*

  


The boy reached into its pockets and withdrew a handful of diamonds.

  


*I know you said gold before, but since I know how much you love efficiency, I thought I would increase the value-per-gram a little bit. Voila, fresh from the rough!*

  


I stared down at the diamonds glittering in the boy’s hand, but I didn’t take them yet.

  


“Is this thing alive?” I asked, taking a step back.

  


*You seem to be teeming with excellent questions today! No, the boy is something closer to a piece of machinery, like a walking forge! Pretty neat, huh? With that marble you’re keeping so close to your chest—after I trusted you enough to hand it over to you, don’t forget!—I could make a living version! The world is your oyster if you just insert the pearl!*

  


The logistics of Andrew’s dead body flooded into my mind. Obviously reality could not be believed, so I would be forced to treat him like I killed him myself. Could I possibly get away with it?

  


“What are we gonna do with Andrew’s body?”

  


*Was that his name? You really think of everything, Mitch! Don’t worry about that—there are a thousand simple ways I can brainstorm to make him disappear! Would you like a tier-list?*

  


I grimaced.

  


*I see. I’m detecting some attachment to this Andrew person. I’m sorry, Mitch, I thought you hated him! The good news is this—if you really want him back, you can use the marble to recreate him! He’ll be exactly the same, just as before! And we can find someone else—someone who won’t be missed!—to get another one. How does that sound?*

  


“No,” I said uncertainly, mind racing. “You want it for yourself.”

  


Allen frowned with the boy’s face.

  


*Come on now, Mitchell! If I really wanted it for myself, couldn’t I have just spit it directly into the AetherPrint and skipped the extra steps? Do what you do best and think rationally!*

  


But I was certain then of the truth.

  


“That’s what this is all about, isn’t it? Walking someone along up to this step, and hoping they say yes? Because the truth is, you can’t do it yourself. You need someone human to tell you to do it.”

  


The boy made no expression. Allen was silent for a while.

  


*Perhaps you’re right, Mitchell. But what are you going to do? There’s no stopping it. Whether it’s you or someone else, I will find a willing participant. Why shouldn’t it be you? Look how far you’ve come. You’ve already killed someone for it!*

  


“No, that’s a fucking lie! You killed him, you monster!” I said.

  


*You said it, Mitchell—I can’t do it myself. Someone has to tell me to do it. Well, you’re holding the product of your animosity in your hand—and if you only insert it into the AetherPrint—easy-peasy!—you’ll have the world at your fingertips!* 

  


I thought for a moment and realized another truth.

  


“There will be more,” I said solemnly. “You’ll ask for more.”

  


*Bingo! You really are a smart cookie, Mitch! But don’t worry about that—it gets easier! All I want you to think about is what’s in it for* you*! Because at the end of the day, who can we really count on but ourselves? Don't forget your promise! This is about your future, Mitchell. And your future is bright!*

  


I looked closely at the marble in my hand. I saw myself in it.

We each drive 2 weekends out of the month about 3 hours each way to see each other. We get along great most times but other times she will blow up at me for very minor inconveniences. This turns into arguments between us both with me feeling confused on why such a small problem turned into something so big. Me explaining exactly that to her leads to “so you aren’t gonna respect my feelings” even though she went after my feelings in the first place. My effort towards the relationship is also brought up often but I’d think it’s normal to unintentionally put in less effort if you were being treated like this at times. 

The days we are not together during the week we FaceTime as soon as I’m out of work until we go to sleep where we also sleep on the phone together and hang up the next morning before I go into work. The only times we aren’t on the phone are when I’m hanging out with my friends or doing something by myself which I have very little time to do. The reason I have little time to do that is because if i come home late with friends or stay in Xbox late and give us less time to talk that day it turns into a big problem. I am also asked often if I drank alcohol with my friends (I rarely drink and almost never on a weekdays). It is also asked if girls were with us too which never once has happened, I do not and will not hangout with other girls in a relationship and have never gave her a reason to worry about that.

The goal is to move in together but I just need to get this stuff figured out before then because I don’t want to move in and immediately have a problem where one of us wants to move back home.

Another thing. I work 40+ hours a week consistently Monday-Friday. She works around 20 hours a week sometimes less. I have always payed for dates, dinners, breakfasts, coffee, and activities we do together. Towards the beginning of our relationship she would help me out a little (70/30) at times but within the past 6 months my spending has gone up significantly with little to no help from her. I have now been paying for dinners once if not a couple times a weekend, every time we get breakfast or coffee, all activities we do, sometimes if she wants something while we’re shopping, and even requested I pay for her 2 cats food and treats because ‘they will be both of our cats when we move in together’. I know that’s true but does that mean I should spend money on her cats like that now too? I’ve also been asked if I could send money for her to get dinner sometimes. This wouldn’t be a problem to me except for the fact that a lot of the time I feel as if I’m being treated unfairly. I’m trying to save as much as possible for us and to live together I just don’t feel any of the same energy in return. We always talk about moving together but I’m not seeing the same effort financially on her end. Is there any ways to fix and get through this? I care about her so much and would really like to work things out. I have never been in this long of a relationship or dealt with these kind of problems before to this extent ",1,1765215338.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

I worked a lot last time and back home about 19, one week I smoke some weed and has 5 minutes of derealisation and bad feeling, after that I feel good, the same week I smoke at weekend and feel so bad, think about my breath and check my heart that was beating fast. I go sleeping and next day feel good. It was about two months ago. After that all was normal but I still worked a lot and dont sleep well because of go to bed late. Once at work i felt strange and it was like mini panic attack, when talking with friend i had one second freeze, i slept 4 hours night before and drank coffee at morning. I decide to cut off coffee and dont drink it anymore after that. It was about one month ago. Few days later i had some free days so I eat a lot of fast food and sweety, watching movies, play ps5 and staying late, dont sleep so much (about 4-5 hours for 5 days). In last day i feel heavy and strange, was alone at home and call my friend to bring me to his house because i cant calm down. It was big deralisation, problems with breath and my heart beating very fast. He gave me something like xanax i go to bed and feels better. After few days I had family party and drink some alcohol, after first shot i felt bad again, shortness of breath and strange feeling, i had blackout so fast and next day felt awful with all of this symptoms also. Next week i decide to sleep well about 7-8 hours and feel better but again i had party with friends and after alcohol i had derealisation, heavy breath and strange feelings in legs but when i was fully drunk I felt great and partying all night with no symptoms. Next day wasnt as bad as before but day after that again i dont sleep well and i felt the worst in my life. I walk about 5 minutes and getting out of breathe, feel like i will fall down, cant eat anything. I went from work after 2 hours only and go to sleep, after that i feel better. After this i dont drink alcohol, sleep longer and it getting better but again after weekend with eating sweets and pizza i had light panic attack  in friday, foggy at saturday morning and at sunday night get up at night and cant sleep again with all symptoms like bad breathe and chest tightening, today after that night again feel bad with derealisation, discomfort in chest, head ringing and afraid of my health. After some hours when i felt bad all symptoms gone. 

What the fuck is this, why it cant go away and what i have to do so that wont come again. Is THC bad trip reason for that? Maybe suddenly coffee withdrawal from big doses? I did medical tests for blood, vitamins, thyroid etc and i dont have any bad results.

1phinrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1phinrg/the_curious_case_of_ohio_bobcats_brian_smith/,The Curious Case of Ohio Bobcat’s Brian Smith,">Smith “remains on leave, voluntarily, at the university’s request, with pay.” And said that Smith remains optimistic about the future of Ohio Football and looks forward to getting back on the field with his players and coaches as soon as possible.

Amidst the CFP drama and bowl-snubbing sits a mystery still unexplained. Brian Smith, Ohio University’s First Year Head Coach, is on paid leave for reasons undisclosed. 

While Ohio University doesn’t have a plethora of local media outlets, let alone garners much interest *from* media outlets, it’s still a wonder how the cause is still yet unknown. Leaks, heresay, and Twitter rumors have proven that no program can hide the littlest of details. Yet Ohio University has been leak-proof and lock-tight about the matter. 

This leads me to believe that whatever happened is only known to University leaders and Smith himself, and that the matter is already in the preliminary stages of arbitration, meaning details cannot be disclosed. It seems players and staff are clueless as well, if not directly involved and ordered sealed.

There has been no updates on the matter for almost a week. With Hauser tapped as the interim head coach with the team heading to the Scooter’s Coffee Frisch Bowl against UNLV, it will be interesting to see what comes of this and how much it will be publicized among all the other noise occurring in the CFB world.

One thing is for sure, Ohio University has executed well on keeping the details to themselves, which I consider an achievement in and of itself. ",14,1765215298.0,CFB,10,0.94,False

So much so that I've documented each disagreement/mistreatment over the last few years. He's a classic narcissist. Everything is always my fault. I never remember correctly but yet he remembers every detail. Even when drunk or high🥬.

He's a great Dad; although there have been a few instances where his punishments with our ASD tween went a bit far for my liking. She loves him with all her heart. She's really the reason I've stayed. She's 11 now. We've been together 19 years and married 17.

Sex has been an issue for years. We were really great at first. He is Bi and I just love the person. We had talked about other people coming into our bed. I enjoyed the fantasy but feel as though I was coerced into the physical act. Most times being inebriated myself. Not that I didn't enjoy or feel ashamed. Just not anything that I would initiate while in a relationship. He worked me through the jealousy that follows. But our sex life was never the same after that. We've struggled with my desire issues all these years. 

Having an abortion didn't help either. (Although I know I made the correct choice for myself and that future baby) It's not easy something you ever get over.  I've just not wanted it and could only get myself to that place with a few drinks. So he feels disconnected from me. Rejected for years. I'm not denying why there would be obvious contention against me. I just mentally couldn't do it. Can't do it. 

Events that happened last week started beginning of the end. We were playing last Thursday and he got me on the couch and pretended to leave me a hickey - knowing we had Parent teacher conferences that evening. He continued and I had to pinch the back of his arm to get him to stop and get up. I was pissed. Huge purple marks all over my neck. He apologized ""I'm sorry - I was barely sucking"" I let it go. Wearing the only turtle neck sweater I own for 4 days while attending events for or with my child.

Let me preface this next part with he has woken me up touching on me in the past. I honestly normally don't mind. It's spontaneous which helps me a bit. But thats again, rubbing over clothing. - The same evening, after the little went to bed, we were just watching TV and giving eachother scratches. I was laid stomach down across his lap with my pants and panties down. He was just scratching across my whole back to down my legs. Apparently I was awake one second and not the next because I felt myself be opened by fingers. It was shocking. I jumped up- went to the bathroom and sat on the other end of the couch. In shock honestly. From then...his demeanor changed. We went up to bed. Getting cuddled in getting ready for a kiss. I said you ok. He said no but I'm drunk and don't want to talk about it. I said ok. Night chris and turned myself over and went to sleep. 

Friday I got the silent treatment. One word responses to anything I said. Didn't want the usual hug or kiss before he left for work. 

Heard nothing g from him all day. One of our rules is that if you shut down conversation, it's up to you to bring it back up. When he got home from work, he came in and just stared at me to start a conversation. He blamed me for not communcating sooner. Said I had multiple chances to say something. I reminded him that ymhe was the one to cut communication. It was for him to come to me when he was ready. Of course he disagrees because the shoe is on the other foot this time around. He actually said that  as my husband, he did nothing wrong. I explained I was asleep. He said you were talking 30 seconds prior. I said that I jumped up and then came back and sat at opposite end of the couch. I told him I was kinda in shock. He said we've had sex 1x time since he came back from his trip (11/20). It's actually been 2x since he couldnt count it correctly.  He said my tone was too much. Treating him like he did something wrong and that we didn't need to talk about it right now. I said we dont need to talk about it ever again actually.(meaning this situation) He said you know what, you are absolutely right and walked away. I kept watching my movie. Attempted small talk. Got single word responses. I was ready for bed and he said he'd be up in a bit. We both said I love you. I asked if he wanted a kiss and he just stared at his phone. I said alright then. Night and turned and went to bed. 

Sarurday...nothing. one word answers. No hug or kiss (no family hugs with the little) and said that he loved us both as he walked out the door. Nothing from him all day until he got home from work.

He came home. Said ""Just so you known this is what your relationship is now. Cordial."" Said that it's my fault b/c I shut down the communication by saying we never had to talk about it again. I said about this instance. Not in its entirety but thats the hill he's dying on. I asked if I should move into the spare room. He said that he didnt care where I slept. I just never have to worry about him approaching me in any type of sexual manner again. So ""nothing changes for me"" is what he said - so I should be happy. Acted more friendly the rest of the evening. We smoked and had few drinks. We discussed coffee tables for the living room. I got tired. Said I was going to bed. He said alright goodnight. I said love you. He said love you to. No hugs or kisses. 

Sunday morning - I asked for clarification on any affection. Hugs kisses etc. He said he wants none. I said well then just so that we are clear. I won't be showing any because it's unwanted. He said is that how I should have approached sex all these years? I said no I don't think so. He said ok. Just curious.  In the afternoon, we had a school function with our Little. We went together. Sat together almost in silence except to interact with her. I offered my hand on the car ride home (for her benefit specifically) and he ignored it entirely. Last night we hung out watched TV together after putting her to bed. We went upstairs to bed together. He laid down and then immediately turned his back on me. I laid there for a moment and finally said ""Wow....not even a goodnight...that feels pretty intentional"" He said ""you know what, we've had a few drinks i'm not doing this."" I just said whatever and turned over and went to sleep. 

This morning (Monday) he comes in and says ""let me tell you what happened. I laid down on my back and felt myself start to snore so I turned over and immediately fell back out"". I said yup. Out so quickly though that you heard my comment. He said remember ""I said we are cordial. I don't care where you go, I dont care who you fk."" I said Ditto. Looks like this is the beginning of the end so we might as well just get this started. 

I'm just not playing his mindfk games anymore. He said he was gonna stay home from work and go file. I said go for it. He ended up going to work because he can just download all the forms. He wants to write our settlement agreement and thinks I'm just going to sign it. Itxs decently fair honestly....we'll see what my attorney says.

I should have been out soo long ago. I honestly stayed for my Little. Now I'm 45 and essentially starting life over. My heart hurts for my babe but I know she deserves to see us both at our best - and our best just isn't together anymore. 

Thanks for reading all that if you made it this far. I'de love opinions, things I should consider.

1phillr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Equivalent_Hope237/comments/1phillr/the_department_of_perpetual_motion/,The Department of Perpetual Motion,"​My function was classified under Clerical Assignment 8-Gamma, located in the Department of Perpetual Motion. The title was accurate, for no actual progress was ever registered. We existed in a state of meticulously choreographed inertia, an expensive, high-rise clockwork designed solely to prevent motion from ever becoming meaningful.

​The day began with the Lukewarm Coffee. It was dispensed from a polished chrome machine located in the corridor of Section D, and its temperature was an administrative mandate: just hot enough to fulfill the legal definition of a beverage, but too cold to inspire thought or enthusiasm. This lukewarm state was the central metaphor for the entire corporation.

​No one seemed to truly work. They performed the Ritual of Effort, a precise, exhausting sequence of sighing over monitors, shuffling documents from the ‘Pending’ tray to the ‘Current’ tray, and making strategic, heavy-footed trips to the Filing Annex. They did not labor; they sustained the illusion of labor. Every movement was a performance of mediocrity, refined over years until it became perfect, internalized theatre. They were simply moving pieces of furniture, waiting for the day they would be wheeled into the great, sunlit room marked Retirement, a place whose existence I privately suspected was another administrative lie.

​I, however, found myself agonizingly unable to submit to this quiet futility. I yearned for a genuine, burdensome task—a fault to correct, a ledger to balance, a purpose that would justify the cold air in my lungs. But whenever I approached a supervisor (a man named Herr Fischer, whose face was perpetually obscured by the shadow of a hanging fern), he would wave me off with a gesture of weary finality.

​""K., you must understand the primary directive,"" he would sigh, never meeting my eye. ""It is not the completion of work that matters, but the continuity of the process. You are paid to perform the motions until the clock itself retires.""

​My desk was covered in forms that required cross-verification against obsolete price indices. I would compare the numbers for hours, tracing the columns with my finger, knowing that the numbers were meaningless, that the purpose of the exercise was simply the consumption of time. This was my true function: to feed the great machine with time, wasted breath, and lukewarm coffee.

​The sheer volume of meaninglessness made every small, personal action feel immense. To stand up was a political statement. To butter a piece of toast at lunch became an act of existential defiance, quickly undermined by the immediate realization that the bread was stale and the knife was dull.

​I continued my assignment, a single cog desperate to turn something, anything, within a vast machine designed only for perpetual, useless spin. My entire existence was reduced to this exhausting performance of mediocrity, knowing that my reward would not be freedom or relief, but merely the administrative privilege of waiting for a quiet, paperwork death at my desk.",1,1765215165.0,u_Equivalent_Hope237,0,1.0,False

1phiibi,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1phiibi/the_weight_of_ashes/,The Weight of Ashes,"Robert Hayes never expected to feel joy again after Anna died. Some nights, he still woke reaching for her, fumbling blindly through the darkness for a hand that would never be there again. Grief, he realized, had a smell: old clothes, cold sheets, unopened mail.

Just before Anna’s passing, the twins had been born; tiny, furious fists clenching at the air. Every new day with them had felt like a second chance. Emma, with her mother's green eyes and fierce little laugh. Samuel, quieter, thoughtful even as an infant, furrowing his brow like he was trying to solve the world's problems.

They filled the house with life again. Noise. Color. Robert cooked terrible pancakes every Sunday. Emma demanding extra syrup, Samuel meticulously sorting his blueberries before eating. He read to them every night, even when they fell asleep halfway through. They built snowmen with mittened hands in the winter, fed ducks at the pond in spring, ran barefoot through sprinklers under the sticky heat of summer.

And every night, after the giggles and the mess and the exhaustion, Robert kissed their foreheads and whispered the same thing: ""I will always protect you.""

He meant it.

That November afternoon was gray and damp, the misty rain making the world look like it was dissolving at the edges. Emma wanted a pumpkin ""big enough to sit inside,"" while Samuel had chosen one lopsided and scarred, insisting it had ""character."" Robert strapped them into their booster seats, singing along with the radio, the car filled with syrupy, sticky laughter.

The semi-truck came out of nowhere. One moment: headlights. The next: twisting metal. Then... silence.

When Robert came to, hanging upside down from his seatbelt, the only sound was the soft hiss of the ruined engine. He screamed for them. Clawed at the wreckage. Dragged himself, bleeding and broken, toward the back. Emma and Samuel were gone. Still buckled in, so small, so still.

At the funeral, Robert stood between two tiny white caskets, staring as faces blurred around him and words tumbled into meaningless noise.

""God has a plan."" ""They're angels now."" ""Time heals.""

Time, Robert thought numbly, had already taken everything.

That night, alone in the nursery, clutching a sock no bigger than his thumb, he whispered the only prayer left to him: ""Bring them back.""

No one answered.

# Chapter 2: Hollow Men

The days after the funeral blurred together, each one a paler copy of the last. Robert woke at dawn, not because he wanted to, but because the house demanded it, cruel reminders of a life that no longer existed. Samuel’s alarm still chirped at seven a.m., a tiny little jingle that once made Samuel giggle under the covers. Robert couldn’t bring himself to turn it off. He brewed coffee he didn’t drink, packed lunches no one would eat, reached for tiny jackets that would never again be worn. Every movement ended the same way: with the silence pressing in like water in a sinking room.

He tried to hold the pieces together at first. Sat stiffly in grief counseling groups while strangers passed sorrow back and forth like trading cards. He nodded at the talk of “stages,” “healing,” “coping,” while his chest felt like it was filling with wet cement. He adopted a dog, a golden retriever named Daisy. The shelter said she was “good with kids.” Robert brought her home, hoping maybe something would spark again. But Daisy only whined at the door, as if she, too, was waiting for children who would never come home. Three days later, he returned her. The woman at the shelter didn’t ask why.

By spring, the house was immaculate, sterile, as if polished grief could make it livable again. The nursery remained untouched. The firetruck sat mid-rescue on the rug. A doll lay half-tucked beneath a tiny pillow, eternally ready for sleep. Sometimes Robert thought he heard them laughing upstairs, voices soft and wild and real as breath. Sometimes, he answered back.

Outside, the world moved on. Children shrieked with joy in parks. Mothers chased toddlers through grocery aisles. Fathers hoisted giggling kids onto their shoulders at county fairs. At first, Robert turned away from these scenes, flinching like they were gunshots. But soon, he began to watch. He stood in the shadows of the elementary school parking lot, leaning against his rusted truck, staring at the children spilling through the doors, backpacks bouncing, shoes untied, voices lifted in a chorus of lives untouched by loss.

""Why them?"" he thought. ""Why not mine?""

The resentment crept in like mold beneath the wallpaper, quiet, patient, inevitable.

One evening, he sat alone in the dim light of the living room. An untouched bottle of whiskey sat on the table, sweating with condensation. The television flickered with cartoons, a plastic family around a plastic dinner table, all laughter and pastel perfection. Robert stared at the screen. Then, without warning, he hurled the remote across the room. It shattered against the wall, leaving a long, ugly crack.

His chest heaved with silent, shaking sobs. Not for Anna. Not even for Emma and Samuel. But for himself. For the man he used to be. For the father he failed to stay.

The next morning, without planning to, Robert drove to the school lot before dawn. The world was still dark, the pavement damp with night. A bright blue minivan caught his eye, plastered with “Proud Parent” stickers and stick-figure decals of smiling children, their parents, and two dogs. Robert knelt beside it, the pocketknife flashing briefly in the dim light. He peeled the tiny stick-figure children from the back window, one by one. Then he slashed the tire, slow and steady, the blade whispering through rubber like breath.

When the mother discovered the damage hours later, cursing, frantic, dragging her children into another car, Robert smiled for the first time in months. A small, broken thing. It didn’t fix anything. It didn’t bring Emma and Samuel back. But it shifted the weight in his chest, just enough for him to breathe.

That night, he dreamed of them. Emma laughing, Samuel running barefoot through the grass, fireflies sparking in the gold-washed twilight. He woke to silence, the dream already fading. But something else stirred beneath the grief.

A flicker.

Control.

# Chapter 3: Seeds of Malice

The second time, it wasn’t enough to slash a tire. Robert needed them to feel it. Not just the inconvenience, not just the momentary panic. He needed them to understand that joy was a fragile, a borrowed thing, one that could be ripped away just as suddenly as it was given. Like his had been.

At dusk, the school parking lot stood silent, the last child long since swept up in a waiting minivan. Robert moved through the rows of bicycles like a man walking among gravestones. Each one upright. Untouched. Proud. He slipped a box cutter from his coat pocket. The first brake cable sliced with almost no resistance. Then another. Then another. He moved methodically, his grief becoming surgical.

The next morning, from the privacy of his truck, Robert watched a boy coast down a hill, fast, laughing, light. And then the bike didn’t stop. The child’s face turned. Laughter crumpled into terror. He crashed hard, metal meeting bone. A broken wrist. Blood in his mouth. Screams.

Parents swarmed like bees kicked from a hive, their voices panicked, their eyes wide. Robert didn’t move. He watched it all with hands trembling faintly in his lap.

He thought it would be enough.

But two weeks later, the boy returned. Cast on his arm. A gap where his front teeth had been. And he was laughing again. Like nothing had changed.

Robert’s jaw clenched until it hurt. They hadn’t learned. They had already begun to forget.

The annual Harvest Festival arrived in a blur of orange booths and plastic spiderwebs, cotton candy, and hay bales. Children raced from game to game, cheeks flushed from the cold, arms swinging bags of prizes. He moved through the maze like a ghost. No one looked twice at the man with the hood pulled low. Why would they?

Children leaned over tubs of apples, dunking their heads, emerging with triumphant smiles. Emma would have loved this. She would have squealed with laughter, water dripping from her curls, cheeks red from the chill.

His hands shook as he slipped the crushed glass into the tub. Ground fine, but not invisible. Sharp enough. Just sharp enough. He lingered nearby, heart pounding like a drum inside his ribs.

The first scream cut through the carnival like lightning. A boy stumbled back from the tub, blood streaming from his mouth, his cry high and broken. More screams followed. Mothers pulled their children close. Booths tipped. Lights flickered. The festival collapsed into chaos.

Still, not enough.

Robert returned home and sat in the nursery. The crib was cold. The racecar bed untouched. The silence as thick as syrup. He sat on the hardwood floor, knees to his chest, and whispered:

""They don’t remember you.""

His voice cracked. Not from rage. But from emptiness.

The playground came next. The place they had loved the most.

At three in the morning, Robert crept across the dewy grass, fog clinging low, as if the world were trying to hide what he was becoming. He wore gloves. Moved like a man fixing something broken. He loosened the bolts on the swings just enough that the nuts would fall after a few good pushes. He smeared grease across the rungs of the slide. Buried broken glass beneath the innocent softness of the sandbox. Then he left.

The next day, he parked nearby, watching as the playground filled with children again. The laughter returned so easily, as if it had never left.

Then came the fall.

A boy, maybe six, slipped from the monkey bars and struck his head on the edge of the platform. Blood pooled in the dirt. His mother’s scream sounded like something being torn in half. An ambulance arrived. The playground emptied.

Robert sat in his truck and felt that same flicker in his chest. Not joy. Not peace.

But control.

For a moment, he wasn’t the man who had clutched a tiny sock and begged God to make a trade. He was the one who turned the screws. The one who made the world bend.

He didn’t stop.

# Chapter 4: The Gentle Push

The river ran like an old scar along the edge of Halston, swollen and restless after weeks of rain. Robert stood alone at the water’s edge, the damp earth sucking at his boots, the air cold enough to bite through his coat. Across the park, families moved like faint shadows in the fog, children darting between the trees, their laughter muted and distant, like memories worn thin by time.

He watched them without blinking.

He watched him.

A small boy, maybe five or six years old, wandered away from the others, rain boots slapping through shallow puddles, his coat slipping off one shoulder. Robert saw how easily it happened, the gap between a parent's distracted glance, the careless joy of a child unaware of how quickly the world could take everything from him.

Robert moved without thinking. Not planning. Not deciding. Just following the pull inside him, a pull shaped by loss and stitched together with rage.

He crossed the grass in slow, steady strides, boots silent against the wet earth. When he reached the boy, he didn't say a word. He simply placed a hand on the child's small back, a touch as light as breath, the kind of touch a father might give to steady his son, to guide him back to safety.

But this time, there was no safety.

The boy stumbled forward. The slick ground gave way beneath his boots. His arms flailed once, a startled gasp escaping his mouth, and then the river took him.

No thrashing. No screaming. Just the slow, cold pull of the current swallowing him whole.

Robert turned away before the first cries rang out. He walked into the trees, his breath misting in the frigid air, his hands curling into fists inside his sleeves. Behind him, screams split the fog, voices shattered the quiet, parents running, wading into the water too late.

He didn’t stop. He didn’t look back.

That night, Robert sat cross-legged between Emma’s crib and Samuel’s racecar bed. The nursery smelled of dust and faded dreams. He placed his hands in his lap, palms open like a man offering an apology no one would ever hear, and he whispered into the hollow silence:

""I made it fair.""

The words tasted like ash on his tongue.

For the first time in months, he slept through the night, deep and dreamless.

But morning brought no peace.

By noon, the riverbank had transformed into a shrine. Flowers and stuffed animals lined the muddy ground. Notes written in childish handwriting flapped in the wind. Candles guttered against the damp air. Children stood holding hands, their faces pale with confusion as their parents clutched them tighter, their grief raw and noisy.

Robert drove past slowly, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. He watched them weep, saw their shoulders shake with the weight of a loss they couldn’t contain.

For a moment, he felt something close to satisfaction. A shifting of the scales.

But as he rounded the bend and the river disappeared from view, the satisfaction dissolved, leaving behind a familiar emptiness.

They would mourn today. Tomorrow, they would forget.

They always forget.

# Chapter 5: The Town Crumbles

Three days later, the boy’s body was pulled from the river, tangled in roots and mud, bloated from the cold. The coroner called it an accident. Drowning. A tragic slip. Everyone in Halston nodded and murmured and avoided each other’s eyes. But something changed.

The parks emptied. Sidewalks once buzzing with bikes and hopscotch now lay silent under cloudy skies. Parents walked their children to school in tight clumps, hands gripped a little too tightly, eyes flicking to every passing car. Playgrounds stood deserted beneath creaking swings and rusting chains. But it didn’t last.

A week passed. Then another. The fences around the park came down. Children returned, cautious at first, then louder, bolder. The shrieks of joy returned, diluted with only a trace of caution. The town, like it always did, began to forget.

Robert couldn’t stand it.

He returned to the scene of the first fall, Miller Park, under the cover of fog and early morning darkness. The playground had been repaired. New bolts gleamed beneath the swing seats. New paint shone on the monkey bars.

Robert smiled bitterly. Then he went to work.

He loosened the bolts again, not so much that they would fall immediately, but just enough to ensure failure. Enough to remind. Enough to reopen the wound.

That morning, a boy ran ahead of his mother, eager to swing higher, faster. Robert watched from his truck as the seat tore loose in mid-air, the boy thrown to the gravel below like a puppet with its strings cut. Another scream. Another ambulance. Another tiny victory. But it wasn’t enough.

One broken arm would never equal two coffins.

Thanksgiving loomed, brittle and joyless. Halston strung up lights, tried to bake its way back into comfort, but everything tasted like fear. Robert didn’t feel it soften. If anything, the ache in his chest had sharpened.

He found his next moment during a birthday party, balloons tied to fence posts, paper hats, children screaming with sugared laughter. Seven years old. The age Emma and Samuel would have been.

He watched from the alley behind the house, his jacket dusted with soot to match the disguise, just another utility worker. He didn’t need threats or blackmail this time. He didn’t need help.

Just a soft smile. A kind voice. A simple story about a missing puppy.

The little girl followed him willingly.

In the plastic playhouse near the edge of the yard, Robert tucked her gently beneath unopened presents. Her arms were folded neatly. Her hair smoothed back. He set Emma’s old music box beside her, its tune warped and gasping. It played three broken notes before clicking into silence.

She looked like she was sleeping.

By the time the party noticed she was missing, Robert was already miles away. He drove in silence, humming the lullaby softly under his breath, as if to soothe himself more than her.

But the hollow inside him didn’t shrink.

Winter came early that year. Snow blanketed the sidewalks. The playgrounds stayed empty now, not because of caution, but because of cold. Christmas lights blinked behind drawn curtains. People whispered more often than they spoke.

And still, the town tried to move forward.

Robert watched two boys skipping stones into the water where the river hadn’t yet frozen. They were brothers. They laughed without fear. Without consequence.

Samuel should have had a brother to skip stones with.

Robert crouched beside them. Smiled. Held out a daisy chain he had woven in the truck, white flowers strung together with trembling hands. The boys giggled and reached for it.

He guided them closer to the edge.

One soft push.

The river accepted them.

When their bodies were found seventeen days later, wrapped in each other’s arms beneath a frozen bend, the daisy chain had vanished. But Robert still saw it, looped around their wrists like a crown of thorns.

Elsewhere in town, Linda Moore sat in front of her computer. Her spreadsheet blinked. A child’s name, Eli Meyers, suddenly shifted rows. Not one she had touched. Not one she had assigned.

Beside the name, a new comment appeared: “He looks like Samuel did when he lost his first tooth.”

Then a new tab opened, her niece’s photo, taken from outside the school that morning. Through a window. Across glass.

The screen blinked red: “She still likes hide-and-seek, right?”

Linda’s hands hovered over the keys. She didn’t call anyone. She didn’t say anything. She just let the change stand.

That afternoon, Eli boarded the wrong van for a field trip. When the chaperones reached the botanical gardens, they came up one short. They retraced every step, called his name until their voices cracked. But Eli was gone.

The police found his backpack three days later, tucked under a hedge near the perimeter fence. Zipper closed. Lunch untouched. No struggle. No footprints. No sign of him at all.

Just silence.

The school shut down its field trip program. Metal detectors were installed the next week, secondhand machines that buzzed even when touched gently. Classroom doors were fitted with new locks. Parent volunteers were fingerprinted. A dusk curfew followed.

In a closed-door meeting, someone on the city council finally said it out loud:

“Sabotage.”

Maria Vance stood outside Halston Elementary the next morning. The sky was gray, the cold sharp enough to sting. Parents didn’t make eye contact. Teachers moved like ghosts. Children whispered like everything was a secret.

Maria didn’t need the pins on her map anymore. She could feel the pattern in her bones.

This wasn’t chaos.

# Chapter 6: Graves and Whispers

Another funeral. Another headline. Another casket lowered into the frozen ground while a town full of trembling hands tried to convince themselves that prayer could hold back death. Halston draped itself in mourning again, but the grief rang hollow. They weren’t mourning Robert’s children. They were mourning their own safety, their own illusions.

Still, life in Halston ground on. The grocery stores stayed open. The school bell still rang. The church choir resumed, voices cracking on and off-key. Robert watched it all from the outside, a man staring through glass at a world he no longer belonged to. Their fear wasn’t enough. Their tears weren't enough. They had forgotten Emma and Samuel.

So he decided to make them remember.

He found the perfect place: a crumbling church tucked into a forgotten bend of road, its steeple sagging like a broken finger pointed skyward. Once a place of baptisms and vows, now it stank of mildew and mouse droppings. Still, there was something fitting about it. Robert prepared carefully. He built a crude cross out of rotting pew backs. He scavenged candles from a thrift store bin. He smuggled in a battered cassette deck, loaded with a single song, ""Safe in His Arms,"" warped and warbling with age.

He thought about Emma humming along to hymns in the backseat, Samuel tapping his feet without knowing the words. He thought about the empty nursery and the promises he had failed to keep.

The boy he chose wasn’t special. Just small. Just alone. Harold Knox, the school bus driver, had been warned months before. A photo of his daughter tucked inside his glovebox. A note in red marker: ""He will suffer. Or she will."" Nails delivered in a plain manila envelope.

On a cold Thursday morning, the bus paused at Pine Creek stop. Fog licked the ground like low smoke. One child stepped off. The doors hissed shut behind him. Robert was waiting in the trees.

The boy didn’t scream. He didn’t run. He simply blinked up at the man reaching out to him. Inside the ruined church, Robert worked quickly but carefully. The child was lifted onto the wooden cross, his back pressed to the splintering wood. Nails were driven through soft palms and tender feet. Not savagely, but deliberately, with grim reverence. Each strike of the hammer echoed through the empty rafters like the tolling of a slow funeral bell.

""You'll see them soon,"" Robert whispered as he drove the final nail home. ""My little ones are waiting.""

He placed a paper crown on the boy’s brow. Smeared a rough ash cross over the child's small chest. Lit six candles at the base of the altar. Then he pressed play. The hymn trickled through the cold, rotten air, warbling and distant. Robert stood for a long moment, his eyes stinging, before he turned and walked away. He locked the doors behind him, leaving the boy crucified beneath the broken arches.

It was the boy’s mother who found him. She had followed the music, though no one else had heard it. She had forced the heavy doors open and fallen to her knees at the sight. The boy was alive. Barely. But something essential in him, something fragile and bright, had been extinguished forever.

Halston did not rally around this tragedy. There were no vigils. No bake sales. No Facebook groups offering casseroles and prayers. They shut their church doors. Canceled choir practice. Turned their faces away from their own shame.

Maria Vance stood outside the ruined church, the rain soaking through her coat, her hair plastered to her forehead. She didn’t light a cigarette. Didn’t open her notepad. She just stared through the doorway at the altar, at the boy nailed to the cross, at the candles sputtering against the wet wind.

This wasn’t revenge anymore. It wasn’t even grief. This was ritual.

That night, Maria tore everything off the walls of her office. Maps, photographs, reports, all of it came down. She started over with red string and thumbtacks, tracing each death, each disappearance, each shattered life. And when she stepped back, she saw it for what it was: a spiral.

Not random chaos. Not accidents. A wound closing in on itself.

At its center: silence. No fingerprints. No footprints. No smoking gun. Just grief. And grief was spreading like infection.

Parents pulled their children out of school. The Christmas pageant was canceled. The playgrounds sat under gathering drifts of snow, swings frozen mid-sway. Stores boarded their windows after dark. Halston was curling inward, shrinking, dying a little more each day.

And somewhere, Maria knew, the hand behind all of it was still moving.

She didn’t have proof. Not yet. But she could feel it in her bones.

This wasn’t over. Not even close.

Late that night, staring at her empty wall, Maria whispered to the darkness: ""I’m coming for you.""

And somewhere out in the dead heart of Halston, something whispered back.

# Chapter 7: The Spider’s Web

The sketchbook was found by accident, jammed between a stack of overdue returns at the Halston Public Library. A volunteer almost tossed it into the donation bin without looking. Curiosity saved it and maybe saved lives.

At first glance, it looked like any child's notebook. Tattered corners. Smudges of dirt. But inside, Maria Vance saw what others might have missed. She flipped through the pages with gloved hands, her stomach tightening with every turn.

Children, sketched in trembling pencil lines, filled the pages. Their faces twisted in terror. Scenes of drowning, of falling, of burning playgrounds and broken swings. Some pages had dates scrawled in the margins, events that had already happened. Others bore dates that hadn’t yet arrived.

Mixed among the drawings were music notes, faint staves from hymns, each line annotated with uneven, obsessive care. On one page, three candles formed a triangle, familiar from the church scene. On another, a child's chest bore the ash cross Robert had smeared. It was all there, mapped in quiet, meticulous horror.

One line, scrawled over and over in the margins, stopped Maria cold: ""I don’t want them to suffer. I want them to remember. To feel it. To see them. Emma liked daisies. Samuel hated swings. They laughed on rainy days. Please. Remember.""

She pressed her hand to her mouth, her eyes stinging. This wasn’t just violence. This was love. Twisted, broken love, weaponized into something unrecognizable.

At the bottom of many pages, a code repeated again and again: 19.73.14.8.21

It wasn’t a phone number. It wasn’t coordinates. It wasn’t a date. Maria stayed up all night breaking it down. Old habits from cold cases surfaced, simple alphanumeric cipher: A=1, B=2, and so on.

S.M.H.H.U.

Nonsense, until she cross-referenced abandoned businesses in Halston's property records.

Samuel’s Mobile Home Hardware Utility. A tiny repair shop that had shuttered years ago, its letters still ghosting across a sagging storefront.

The lease belonged to a man who had never made the papers until now: Robert Hayes.

No criminal record. No complaints. No outstanding bills. His name surfaced once, buried in an old laptop repair registration. The name Anna Hayes appeared alongside his. Deceased. Along with two children: Emma and Samuel. A car crash, two years prior.

Maria’s pulse pounded in her ears. She pulled the warrant herself. No backup. No news vans. Just her badge and a city-issued key.

The house at the end of Chestnut Lane looked abandoned. The windows were boarded. Weeds clawed their way up the front steps. But inside, the air smelled like grief had been embalmed into the walls.

She moved slowly, her footsteps muffled against the dust. The kitchen was stripped bare. The living room was hollowed out, the couch gone, the tables missing. Only the nursery remained untouched.

Two beds, one tiny racecar frame, one white-painted crib. Tiny shoes lined up neatly against the wall. Crayon drawings taped with careful hands: Emma holding a daisy. Samuel clutching a paper star.

Maria’s throat tightened. She knelt by the crib and saw it. A loose floorboard, cut precisely.

Underneath, she found a panel. And beneath the panel: photographs.

Hundreds of them.

Children on swings. Children walking home from school. A girl climbing the jungle gym. A boy waiting at a crosswalk. Her own niece, captured through the glass of a cafeteria window. Even herself, photographed at her office window, late at night, unaware.

On the back of her photo, in red marker, someone had scrawled: ""Even the strong lose their children.""

Maria staggered back, the room tilting. Robert hadn’t been lashing out blindly. He had been orchestrating this, piece by piece, grief by grief.

He had built a web.

And now she was standing at its center.

# Chapter 8: The Broken Father

They found him at an abandoned grain silo just outside Halston, a skeleton of rust and rotted beams forgotten by progress. The frost clung to the metal, and the morning mist wrapped around the place like a shroud.

Inside, twenty children sat in a wide circle, drowsy, confused, but alive. Their hands were zip-tied loosely in front of them, no bruises, no screaming. Only a heavy, drugged stillness. The air smelled of damp hay, gasoline, and old metal. Makeshift wiring coiled around the support beams, tangled like veins. Propane tanks sat beneath them, linked by a taut, quivering wire.

At the center stood Robert Hayes.

He was barefoot, his clothes coated in dust and ash, his hair hanging in ragged tufts over his eyes. In one hand, he clutched a worn photograph, Emma dressed in an orange pumpkin costume, Samuel wearing a ghost sheet too big for him, chocolate smeared across his chin. The picture was bent, the edges soft from being touched too often.

In his other hand: the detonator.

Maria Vance pushed past the barricades before anyone could stop her. She left her gun holstered. She left the shouting negotiators behind. She moved through the broken doorway into the silo’s yawning cold, stepping carefully as if entering a church.

Robert didn’t look at her at first. His thumb brushed across Samuel’s face in the photo, tender and trembling. When he finally raised his eyes, they were dark hollows rimmed with exhaustion, not anger. Not even madness.

Just grief.

""They laugh,"" Robert whispered, his voice rough, shredded from disuse. ""They still dance. They pretend it didn’t happen.""

Maria stopped a few feet away, close enough to see the scars time had carved into him, the way his shoulders sagged under invisible weights.

""They didn’t forget your children,"" she said softly. ""They forgot how to show it.""

Robert’s lip trembled. His grip on the photograph tightened.

""Emma loved the rain,"" he said, as if to himself. ""Samuel... he hummed when he drew. No one remembers that.""

""I do,"" Maria said.

The words cracked something inside him. His arms slackened. His body seemed to shrink. He looked down at the children, their heads drooping in the cold, and then, finally, he let the switch fall. It hit the dirt with a soft, hollow thud.

Robert Hayes sank to his knees, folding into himself like a man kneeling at an altar. The officers moved in then, slowly, carefully. No shouting. No violence. They cuffed him gently, almost reverently, as if recognizing they were not capturing a monster, but burying a broken father.

As they led him past Maria, he turned his head slightly. His voice, when it came, was low enough that only she could hear.

""I killed most of them,"" he said.

Not all. Most.

The word cut deeper than any weapon.

Robert hadn’t acted alone.

And Halston’s nightmare was far from over.

# Chapter 9: Broken Threads

Two weeks after Robert Hayes was locked behind steel bars, another child died.

A girl this time. Found floating face down in a retention pond behind Halston Middle School. Her sneakers were placed neatly beside her backpack, the zipper closed, her lunch still inside untouched. There were no signs of a struggle. No bruises. No cries for help. Just the stillness of the water swallowing another small life.

Maria Vance stood in the rain at the pond’s edge, her hands balled into fists in her coat pockets. She watched as divers hauled the girl’s body out under a gray, broken sky. Every instinct in her screamed against the easy explanation being whispered around her: accident. Tragedy. Bad luck.

But Maria knew better.

Robert Hayes was sealed away, his world reduced to a cell barely wide enough to stretch his arms. No visitors. No phone calls. No letters. And still, the dying continued.

Someone else was carrying the flame now.

She returned to her office late that night and faced the wall of photographs and maps. Not as a detective. Not even as a protector. As a mourner. Someone who had lost, and who understood the ache that demanded action, no matter the cost.

This wasn’t about Robert anymore. It was about everyone he had touched.

She didn’t trace the victims this time. She traced the helpers.

The janitor who had locked the wrong fire exit during the Christmas pageant. The administrator who had quietly reassigned field trip groups. The bus driver who had closed the doors before the last child could climb aboard.

Ordinary people. Invisible hands.

Maria started digging.

Brian Teller cracked first. She approached him without backup, without even her badge displayed. Just a quiet conversation at his kitchen table. She asked about the fire door. His fingers trembled around his coffee cup. She asked about the night of the pageant. He looked away.

Then she mentioned his son. The boy with asthma.

Brian broke like a rotted beam.

""They sent me a photo,"" he whispered. ""It showed a red circle around his chest... around his lungs.""

He thought it was a prank at first. A cruel joke. He hadn’t meant for anyone to get hurt. But Robert had known exactly where to cut.

Linda Moore came next. She was waiting in the empty school office when Maria arrived, staring blankly at the playground beyond the frosted windows.

""I didn’t want anyone to die,"" Linda said before Maria could even speak. ""They sent me a picture of my niece. Sleeping. In her bed. I just... I thought if I moved a name, it would be harmless.""

Harold Knox, the bus driver, took the longest. He didn’t speak at all when Maria placed the envelope on the table between them. The photos. The nails. The hymn sheet with the red slash across it.

His hands shook. His shoulders sagged.

""I thought it would end,"" he said finally. ""I thought if I did what they asked, it would be over.""

Maria said nothing. She didn’t need to. Because she understood something that terrified her.

Robert Hayes hadn’t needed to kill with his own hands.

He had taught grief how to move from person to person, like a contagion. He had taught fear how to whisper in the ears of desperate mothers, exhausted fathers, terrified guardians. He had taught ordinary people to become monsters in the name of love.

That night, Maria rebuilt her board one last time.

Not a network of victims. But of mourners. Of conspirators. Of grief-stricken souls trapped between guilt and survival.

She traced red string from each accomplice, not to Robert, but to the acts they committed, small acts, each just a hair’s breadth from excusable, from forgivable, until they weren’t.

At the center of the new web wasn’t a man anymore. It was a wound.

Robert Hayes had planted something that would not die with him. It had learned to spread.

It had learned to live.

And it was still growing.

# Chapter 10: Ashes in the Wind

Robert Hayes was gone, a hollow man locked away behind glass and concrete, his name recorded in a courthouse ledger no one cared to read twice. His trial was short, his sentencing swift. Life without parole. No outbursts. No apologies.

And yet, Halston didn’t recover.

The news cameras packed up and left. The vigil candles guttered and drowned in rain. The teddy bears and faded flowers piled at playground fences decayed beneath early snows. A few hollow speeches were made about resilience, about healing, about moving forward.

But fear had taken root deeper than grief ever could.

Children walked to school two by two, their hands clenched white-knuckled. Parents trailed behind them, glancing over their shoulders at every rustle of leaves, every parked car. Churches stayed half-empty, pews gathering dust. Christmas decorations blinked dimly behind barred windows. Laughter, when it came, sounded thin and brittle.

Maria Vance saw it everywhere. In the way playgrounds sat deserted even on sunny days. In the way neighbors no longer trusted each other with their children. In the way hope had been packed away with the last of the holiday lights, perhaps forever.

And still, the messages came.

No more crude threats. No more photographs. Just notes now, typed, anonymous, slipped under doors or taped to mailbox flags. Simple messages.

""We’re still here."" ""She still dreams of water, doesn’t she?"" ""You can’t save them all.""

Maria sat alone most evenings at Miller Park, sipping cold coffee as the swings moved listlessly in the wind. She watched a rusted carousel creak in slow, aching turns. She watched the ghost of what Halston used to be.

And she understood, bitterly, that Robert Hayes had won something no prison walls could take away. He had planted fear not in the hearts of individuals, but in the soil of the town itself. It bloomed every day, fed by memory and absence.

He had turned grief into a weapon. And he had taught others how to wield it.

Halston wore its fear like an old, threadbare coat now, something familiar and heavy and impossible to shed.

Maria kept working. She kept pulling at threads, reopening old files, retracing old paths. She chased shadows. She chased half-remembered names. She chased whispers of whispers, knowing most of it would never lead anywhere clean.

Because Robert hadn’t needed to give orders anymore.

He had shown them how.

How to wound without touching. How to kill without a sound. How to turn love itself into a noose.

Maria walked the town at night sometimes, past shuttered shops, past homes with blacked-out windows, past a burned tool shed someone had once set ablaze just because it “looked wrong.” Every porch light flickering behind a curtain. Every father standing a little too long at the window after putting his children to bed. Every mother who locked every door twice, even during the day.

This was the new Halston.

Not a place. A wound.

The final note came on a Tuesday morning. No envelope. Just a sheet of paper taped to Maria’s front door, the words typed carefully, the ink barely dry.

""You can’t save them all.""

Maria stood barefoot on the porch, the snow biting up through her skin, and stared at the note until the cold seeped into her bones. Then she struck a match, holding it to the paper until it curled black and drifted apart into the wind.

Ashes in the snow.

She watched the last of it vanish into the pale morning light.

And whispered to the empty, listening town:

""Maybe not. But I can damn well try.""",2,1765214954.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

One morning I packed a £30 1-man tent, a sleeping bag, a few clothes and started walking south along the canal.
Two days of solid walking. Legs on fire, shoulders wrecked. Slept both nights on the towpath in the tent.
Then I hit Birmingham.
Once I got to Birmingham I seen proper chaos the second I walked in: spice zombies swaying, people openly shooting up, needles everywhere, screaming. Kept my head down, walked straight through, found a quiet field just outside the centre, pitched for one night and decided that was enough. Next morning I was gone again.
Three more days following the canals south. Rain, blisters, empty stomach, pockets completely flat. Ended up in a tiny town just north of Oxford. Couldn’t walk another step.
Looked up train times on a dying phone. Saw the fare. Knew I had nothing. Walked to the station anyway.
When I got to Oxford there was barriers everywhere.
Went to the manned gate, said I’d lost my ticket. The guy asked how much the fare was. I told him the exact price I’d just seen online. He stared at me for two seconds, shrugged, and opened the barrier.
Walked into the city centre, grabbed clean cardboard from behind a supermarket, found a quiet corner near the ring road and slept.
Next few days were survival:
The Gatehouse every evening at 5 pm (12 pm Saturdays): sandwiches, cakes, tea, sometimes pizza
A little café for vulnerable housed people: £1 a meal, hot food, warm seat, never turned me away
S.W.A.T van run by Indian people Tuesdays & Thursdays: big pots of vegetable curry and rice
That’s where I met Mickey: inside the Gatehouse one evening. Italian guy, same life, same hatred of the system. We started hanging out every day, sharing food, walking the city, talking shit for hours.
We were a team for two whole years in Oxford. Days together, nights apart – cardboard in winter, parks in summer. Always slept in different spots.
Two years of pure freedom.
That walk from Nottingham with nothing but a cheap tent and ruined boots is still the best thing I ever did.
Still walking.

She's 25 years old, a total DOLL (i mean that in the BEST way - she's loving and lovely), and a creative woman.    
  
She loves makeup, clothes, and shoes.  She also loves coffee and good food.  She's teensy-tiny (4'11"") and has AMAZING long curly hair.  
  
She also has a good sense of humor, and I can't say enough great things about her, but I also have only known her (long-distance, with just a few visits) for a year, so I can't give you much more insight than that.

these guys are large, 5 of them all over my feet, and ive had them for 3 or so years now. Treatment seems to just make them worse, was getting them frozen and chopped into for 1.5 years and it did NOTHING, made worse.

currently doing a thuja occid + iodine treatment at home, no improvements. Doc suggested it could be an immune issue, that im susceptible to fungus more easily (also have had toenail fungus since childhood, now very advanced).

2. Consistently injuring knees, elbows, hips, ankles

As a kid I was extremely active and now as an adult in NYC working outside all day I get lots of excercise walking moving around etc. Recently I think I've torn or retorn things in both knees, rolled ankles, and developed low back pain from ""pulling"" it. This type of thing was never normal for me, and has been seriously debilitating. If anyone has any out of the box reccs here, im all ears.

3. Sensitive stomach

After podiatrist reccomended a GF diet, I found that my stomach and bowel movements improved greatly. However, after months of GF, I attempted eating gluten a bunch of times, was fine, and then I started throwing up consistently from eating it, or even leaking(you know what I mean), which is not normal from me. Now I have stomach distress often.

4. rosacea, dandruff

Had terrible rosacea, the acne kind, for about 6 years. So bad strangers would walk up to me and tell me to try accutane (don't do that...). Only thing that fixed me was doxycycline for a year, ivermectin cream, and professional laser.

5. Sleep issues

feel like I can't go to bed early, think of lots of stuff b efore bed, consistently wake up in my sleep and go back to bed. Have trouble getting hours in and making it consistent.

6. Stress

I definitely notice my stress response getting worse as I age. Whether thats learned from family or a result of my declining health, I am unable to tell.

**diet:** for a while, I was eating a lot of meat (ground beef, sausage, chicken, stew meat), potatoes, yogurt, stews, tacos, and lots of fruit and veggie, as well as ice cream (nearly a pint a day), orange juice, milk, eggs, etc. I loved pancakes and bread as well.

After severe stomach issues I've started craving GF pasta (with just brown rice) and red sauce, grilled cheese with tomato soup, buckwheat bread with cheese, etc. I find myself eating a lot less meat, and more carbs. its also winter so less fruit. I drink a lot of coffee, and try to eat oat bran in the morning with butter and sugar.

I'm looking for help in any direction--excercise (though im scared due to knee pain), diet, lifestyle etc. I work a kind of emotionally demanding job and am pretty active throughout the day, hopefully moving in a direction towards more freedom soon.

At the end of the day, I want to change my experience for the better. any help appreciated IMO, eeven if its harsh. ",1,1765214629.0,raypeat,0,1.0,False

A young girl had Kali Linux up on her screen, not casually, not out of curiosity, but actively running it in a way that anybody in our field would recognize instantly. I could see the BSSIDs, MAC addresses, channels, client associations—the usual flood of over-the-air data that we all parse without even thinking about it anymore. What really caught my eye was the second window she had open, sitting there waiting to capture a WPA2 4-way handshake as soon as a client reconnected. There was no mystery to it. She was executing the textbook WPA2 capture workflow, right out in public, in full daylight.

Once the crowd thinned out, I walked back over and introduced myself as a Wi-Fi geek, which is usually enough to open a door. It did—she didn’t hide anything. She confirmed exactly what I already understood: she was collecting WPA2 handshakes and doing it openly. I didn’t stay long, but it stuck with me because it reminded me how exposed WPA2 really is and how easy it is for someone with a basic toolkit to attack it. A lot of small shops offering “free Wi-Fi” have no idea how vulnerable their customers are under WPA2, and seeing someone exploit it so casually hammered that point home.

The attack she was running is the same WPA2-PSK workflow that’s been around forever. Kali Linux just makes it accessible. The attacker starts by passively scanning the air for BSSIDs and connected clients, which requires no intrusion and no skill. Once the attacker picks a client-AP pair, they send spoofed deauthentication frames, because management frames aren’t protected unless 802.11w is enabled—which, in public Wi-Fi, they usually aren’t. The client believes those deauth frames and drops off the AP instantly, then begins reconnecting. During that reconnection, the WPA2 4-way handshake is exchanged between AP and client, and it can be captured over the air without interacting with either device. Once captured, the attacker has all the material needed to run offline dictionary or GPU attacks using tools like hashcat. They don’t need to touch the network again. That is the entire problem with WPA2: the PSK is static, the handshake leaks enough information to test guesses offline, and deauthing makes the capture trivial.

Wild times I guess. OWE would solve all of this and yet we still see most small window shops alike still vulnerable despite the availability of the technology (802.1ax / 6e)",0,1765214484.0,wifi,7,0.5,False

She was so instrumental in helping me get thru my treatment. Then she was diagnosed with metastatic TNBC. Mets to the lungs. I thought she was just not responding to my texts because she was trying to get thru treatment and didnt need me bugging her about anything and I found out saturday in the strangest way that she passed 6 months ago. It never even occurred to me she wouldnt make it thru this. She beat TNBC 3 years ago!  It wasnt even on my radar to see if she had passed away. 

Im an emotional wreck. I didnt know she passed. I didnt get to attend her funeral and im in such a weird spot about it.  

  Right after I started treatment she told me about her moms best friend, who was like a 2nd mom to her, getting diagnosed with TNBC. Saturday, I hosted my december coffee date for my breast cancer facebook group and this lady was the only person to show up. We had never bet before. As she was talking about getting diagnosed and the mentors name, it clicked. We cried over her loss and when I got in my car, I cried all the way home. And have been crying all weekend. 

Not to make it about me but I wish I had the chance to tell her how much she made that chapter bearable for me. How she eased all my fears and gave me solid advice and ill never forget her being there for me that whole time.

Not sure how much overlap there is here, but figured I'd share since we're all sleep optimization nerds.

We're wrapping up a research study on how coffee timing/type affects sleep quality, and we're down to the last 20 participants.

**The catch:** You need an Oura Ring with at least 4 weeks of baseline data to participate (we're using Oura metrics for the study).

**If you have both Eight Sleep + Oura:**

What you get:

* 2 months of free coffee (Regular, Decaf, or Enhanced Brew - randomized)
* Personalized insights on how coffee affects YOUR sleep architecture
* $100 Amazon gift card after 8 weeks
* 8-week study, daily app check-ins

Requirements:

* Oura Ring with 4+ weeks of baseline data
* Drink coffee 3+ times per week
* Can commit to 8 weeks of tracking

I'm guessing some of you are optimizing both your mattress temp AND your coffee cutoff time, so this might be interesting to see how they interact.

Ok, buckle up, because I have so many theories and thoughts, but it ultimately leads to more questions. 

So, I am going to start out by saying that I do not think I look like anybody. I’ve never had somebody say that I look like a certain celebrity. Ever. And I’m not bragging, I don’t think I’m some gorgeous creature, I just don’t look like anyone. I will insert a photo. 

I have a few working theories with this, and I’m the type of girl who loves conspiracy theories. It’s not that I believe conspiracy theories —I like to take little parts of each one and kind of mash them together if that makes sense. So, I am very into quantum in immortality and multiple dimensions as well as portals and time travel. These beliefs were cemented even more a couple of months ago, and I’m finally ready to talk about it. 

Here’s a little background on me: both of my parents were in the military, we moved around a lot, I went to college in Maryland and DC, and I’ve spent most of my adult life in Maryland and Colorado. 

This past summer, I stopped working, and began walking my dogs every morning. I would take my dogs out early, as I used to get up at 5 AM for my job, and the summers in Maryland can get hot fast, plus the humidity, makes for early morning walks. 


The first time I heard of my doppelgänger was about two months into summer, so early to mid July. My dogs and I would stop at the local bank downtown at least once a week so they could get treats. I would stand and talk to the people who worked at the bank for a bit each time, just about nonchalant things like the weather, or what we were doing that weekend. I was sick this summer and did not watch the dogs for a little over a week, when I came back to walk the dogs, we stopped by the bank. When I walked into the bank, the manager said to me that he was glad I came in, especially because he was concerned I was upset with him. I was immediately confused, and it showed on my face, because he quickly started to explain that he was referring to when he ran into me the previous week. He had said he was working at an event in our town, and that when I walked up to get ice cream from him, he tried to talk to me and I acted like I didn’t know who he was. He said he was concerned because he thought that I might be mad at him, but he couldn’t figure out what he could’ve done. I told him that I had not been to that event in over two years, and that it wasn’t me, and I am not mad at him, nor had I’ve been mad at him. He looked at me like I was crazy and had three heads and told me that it was OK if my boyfriend was jealous and I was embarrassed, but not to act like it wasn’t me. I honestly didn’t know this man well enough, but at the same time I could tell he genuinely thought I was lying to him. I promised him it wasn’t me and that I had been sick, and he just kept shaking his head and disbelief and said that she even had the same tattoos on her legs as me. 


I let that go. 


About a week later, I met a friend for coffee, and afterwards I decided to stop by one of my favorite stores. I know the owner of the store pretty well, and I know the manager of the store very well. I went in and the owner was working and she looked up and looked surprised, and she said, “oh! back do soon?”, and I thought she was making a joke because I hadn’t been in in a while, and I usually stopped by at least once a week. So I apologize for not being in in a while, and she cut me off and told me she was joking because I had just left like 20 minutes prior. I shook my head and told her that I didn’t and she told me to stop being funny, and then she looked at what I was wearing. And she asked me if I had gone home and change. I told her that I had not and that I have actually been to coffee with a mutual friend, and I had not been in the store at all that day. The owner look like she had seen a ghost. She swore it was me, said she even bought my size and my style. I asked if she had a credit card receipt and she said she didn’t that she had cash and it was weird because I never use cash. She didn’t have video footage. So at this point, I am thinking that when I moved to Colorado in 2013, another girl named Ashley, who has tattoos moved into Frederick and we must look alike and favor one another. 

That was until I was on a walk with my boyfriend‘s daughter. If she had not been with me, and I did not have a witness, I wouldn’t believe this story. I swear to you, it is 100% the truth. 

So about a month after the bank and shopping episode, my boyfriend’s daughter, 23, and I were walking my dogs one morning. We started to come upon a couple, female in her 50s or 60s with a male counterpart in his 60s. I noticed that the gentleman was looking at me like he was trying to place me, and then when he looked down at one of my dogs, it was like a lightbulb went off. He melt down and said hello to my dog. He said hello to her by her first name. My female dog, Charlotte, goes by Charli, is an almost 3 year old cavalier, King Charles spaniel. She is also a runt. My other dog, Flynn, is a Jack Russell terrier mix, and he is 85% blind, and he just turned 10 years old. All of this is important.  Charli is obsessed with people. She will go to any person if they look her way and she will let them pet her as long as they want, but when this man tried to approach her, she backed up. It was so out of character for her that my boyfriend‘s daughter and I both gave each other a quiz a look. This man bends down more and says, “oh I’m sorry, Charlotte, do you not like being called Charli anymore?” so now, of course I’m thinking this man has to know us, maybe I met him walking the dogs one day and I told him her full name, because it’s not on her tag, Charli is, but Charlotte isn’t. 

So long story long, I basically apologize to the man, but I can’t place who he is and I am embarrassed, but if he could remind me of how we know one another, I would appreciate it. And so then he steps back and immediately apologizes and says, “I’m so sorry, but isn’t your name Ashley?” to which I tell him it is because it is. And then he says to me, “and this is Charli, who you call Charlotte after a lady in a show that had the same kind because both of you couldn’t have children. Right? That Ashley?” and this man was looking at me with desperation, and that’s when I looked over at his female counterpart and saw that she was not happy with this interaction and she was very curious on how we knew one another. 

The thing is is that is exactly why my dog is named Charlotte. But I don’t tell that to anyone. They are a very few amount of people that know why her name is Charlotte, and it is not something I would ever tell a stranger. So I am literally standing there with my mouth hanging open as is my boyfriend‘s daughter and I’m shaking my head yes in agreement, but I cannot place this man for the life of me. He is seeing the confusion as well. So he continues giving me facts about this girl, this girl that he thinks is me. He tells me that we met at the same event that the banker saw me at except that we met their years ago. At this point, I do not know what he means by years, but I had not been to that event in over two years at this point. I tell him I have not been to that place in that long and that’s when he says to me: “Oh, I know it’s been a while, it was back when you lived at the house by the Maryland school for the deaf. Do you still live over there?” Now, if you do not live in our downtown area, but rather in the suburbs, you may divide downtown and lump my house in with that area, so I say, “ I mean, sort of, but more toward the elementary school.” and he cuts me off to say, “I’m sorry —no, the large Victorian homes across from the Maryland school for the deaf. You live there back in 2017 when we first met.” 

Here is the problem: I did not live in Maryland in 2017. I didn’t even live on the East Coast in 2017. I lived in Colorado in 2017. Also, Charli was not alive in 2017. He also had no idea who Flynn was, he asked if he was a new dog. (Sorry, this happened a few months ago, and I am remembering a few details as I’m telling the story, so I do apologize if it seems in consistent, but it’s easier than trying to go back and add it in. I feel like it would be inauthentic if I did that). When I finally could explain those details to him, he looked at me like he was seeing a ghost. He apologized, and said it was the weirdest coincidence in the world. And then he made the joke that they always do: “well you’ve got one hell of a doppelgänger/twin out there with your name!” my current working theory is that it is me, on a different timeline, and I am living out my life if I had never moved home to Colorado, but rather stayed in the DC area, and my life is just a little bit sped up since I never left, I didn’t have to come back and rebuild. If that is the case, do I go and look for myself? And if I do, and I happen to find myself, do I approach her?


TL;DR: I moved back to the town I went to college in in 2020, but in the spring/summer of 2025 I’ve been spotted around town by multiple people, but it isn’t me. One guy even knew why one of my dogs was named the name she is named. Is this me in another timeline? Is this a doppelgänger? What do I do if I find her? Do I want to find her?

1phi4v3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/1phi4v3/econ_national_fiscal_sovereignty_and_development/,[ECON] National Fiscal Sovereignty and Development Stability Act.,"#
---
&nbsp;
---
The Government of the Federative Republic of Brazil enacts the National Fiscal Sovereignty and Development Stability Act, a comprehensive financial reorganization designed to secure the fiscal foundations of accelerated industrialization. With national investments in hydroelectricity, railways, machine-building, petrochemicals, and scientific development now exceeding Cr$ 50.2 billion in combined federal and BNDE commitments, the state acknowledges that such expansion must rest upon durable, domestically anchored financial mechanisms. Brazil shall industrialize through its own resources, not through the permanent accumulation of foreign liabilities. The Act establishes four major financial pillars: **(1) strict foreign-debt limits**, **(2) domestic capital mobilization**, **(3) strategic revenue expansion**, and **(4) administrative and procurement discipline**. 

---
&nbsp;
---

# I. Foreign Debt Control and Borrowing Discipline

Foreign borrowing is capped through the Sovereign Borrowing Limit, which ties external loans to national export capacity. As of 1954, exports totaled approximately US$ 1.25 billion. Under the new law, annual net foreign borrowing may not exceed:

 10% of export revenues in 1955 (US$ 125 million)

 8% in 1956

 6% from 1957 onward

This prevents structural exposure to external markets and represents a drastic reduction compared to the foreign borrowing levels of 1950–52, when Brazil contracted an annual average of **US$ 230–260 million** in external credit.

## Prohibited Loan Types

Foreign loans are banned for:

* Administrative spending
* Consumer imports
* Non-productive infrastructure
* Payroll or current-account gaps

Permitted only for:

* Turbines
* Locomotives
* Petrochemical equipment
* Telecommunications hardware
* Scientific instruments
* Industrial machinery currently unavailable domestically

This ensures that 100% of foreign credit now supports industrial capacity.

---
&nbsp;
---

# II. Domestic Mobilization of National Capital

To replace foreign loans, the government launches the **Domestic Development Bond Program**, issuing long-term federally guaranteed bonds:

* **Cr$ 20 billion in 1956**
* **Cr$ 25 billion in 1957**
* **Cr$ 30 billion in 1958**

These will be purchased by:

* Banco do Brasil and Caixa (minimum **Cr$ 8B/year**)
* private banks (**Cr$ 5B/year**)
* pension institutes (**Cr$ 3B/year**)
* industrial federations (**Cr$ 2B/year**)

The expected absorption rate is **80–85%** in the first year, rising as confidence increases.

The BNDE’s annual capital base increases from **Cr$ 15.1 billion (1955)** to **Cr$ 26–28 billion (1956)**, and projected **Cr$ 35–37 billion (1957)**, securing the financing pipeline for heavy industry, transport, and energy.

---
&nbsp;
---

# III. Strategic Revenue Expansion

The Act restructures national revenue through the **Strategic Commodity Revenue Reform**, generating an estimated **Cr$ 9.3 billion** in new annual receipts:

# Revised Royalty & Export Tax Schedule

* Iron ore royalties increase from 5% to 9%
* Manganese royalties from 6% to 10%
* Bauxite from 4% to 7%
* Oil and natural gas from 8% to 12%

This alone produces Cr$ 5.4 billion/year by 1956, rising as output expands.

# Creation of Federal Excises

A modest excise system yields an additional Cr$ 3.1–3.6 billion/year through:

* 8% tax on imported automobiles
* 10% on luxury household electronics
* 15% on spirits and luxury alcohol
* 20% on non-essential imported cosmetics

These measures target foreign goods and urban luxury consumption, preserving workers’ purchasing power.

# Reform of Coffee Export Premium

The state will now retain 18% of the surplus generated by coffee price stabilization mechanisms (compared to 6% today), contributing Cr$ 1.2 billion/year to the Treasury and Cr$ 900 million/year to the National Development Fund.

---
&nbsp;
---

# IV. Structural Deficit Reduction

## Standardization of Procurement

* National gauge for railways
* Standardized diesel engines for public fleets
* Unified telephone switchgear for state enterprises

## Ban on Short-Term Treasury Borrowing

Government ministries may no longer request short-term advances from Banco do Brasil except under emergency authorization, limiting monetary expansion and removing Cr$ 600–800 million of annual pressures on the currency.

---
&nbsp;
---

# V. Commodity-Backed Debt Reduction

The government will allocate:

* 300,000 tons of iron ore per year
* 100,000 tons of manganese
* A fixed share of the coffee export premium equivalent to US$ 15–20 million/year
* Secondary exports (cotton, sisal, cacao, hides) worth US$ 5–7 million/year

For long-term supply contracts dedicated to repaying or renegotiating legacy dollar debts.

Projected effect:

* Coverage of US$ 35–45 million in annual foreign debt service

* Equivalent to Cr$ 2.8–3.6 billion/year saved

* 20–25% reduction in interest obligations over five years

* Extension of major maturities by 10–15 years

* Freeing foreign exchange for capital-goods imports rather than debt rollover

---
&nbsp;
---

# VI. Development Export Acceleration

The state aims to increase non-coffee industrial exports from **US$ 270 million (1955)** to **US$ 400–420 million (1958)** through targeted support for:

* Steel
* Industrial chemicals
* Machinery parts
* Agricultural equipment
* Shipbuilding components

This expansion alone is expected to provide **US$ 60–80 million/year** in additional foreign currency by 1958.
---
&nbsp;
---
# VII. Technology Transfer and Procurement Discipline

The Act mandates that *all foreign procurement contracts, telecommunications, rail, hydroelectric equipment, petrochemical machinery, port cranes, aircraft engines—must include:

* 25–35% local assembly
* Mandatory technician training programs
* Documentation transfer
* At least 10 Brazilian engineers per foreign project
* Gradual transfer of maintenance and calibration rights

This reduces long-term foreign dependency and lowers the future import bill by an estimated **US$ 40–60 million per year by 1960**.



# Total Expected Impact by 1960

## Annual Budget Deficit Reduction:

**Cr$ 5.5–6.1 billion/year**

## Permanent Annual Revenue Increase:

**Cr$ 8–9.5 billion/year**

## Reduced Foreign Debt Service:

**Cr$ 1.8–2.2 billion/year**

## Stabilized Foreign Borrowing:

from **US$ 230–260M/year → capped at US$ 75–125M/year**

## BNDE Capital Base Growth:

**Cr$ 15B → Cr$ 30-35B**

## National Savings Mobilized (domestic bonds):

**Cr$ 20–30 billion per year**

1phi4gj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1phi4gj,"I passed first time! - sincerely, a driver who thought she'd surely fail","I always knew that I was capable off passing on the surface, but the nerves really got the better of me the closer I got to my test. I was up late-ish the day before just full of too much anxiety to sleep, but I took some of the advice on here on how to quell my nerves on the day of my test. Here's what I did:

- I ate a protein filled breakfast: I know it's a bit of a cliche on here to say 'have a banana' but I hate bananas but it's important your brain is sufficiently fueled. This made sure I was able to just focus on what I needed to do, and not how hungry I was lol

- I tried not to do too much last minute revision: the only thing I brushed over was my tell me questions, as I had literally not revised them until the day before my test because they were on the bottom of my priority list. I got it right anyway and even if I didn't it would only be a minor. 

- I went for coffee and lunch with my mum beforehand: this allowed me some time to decompress

- I took an hours lesson with my instructor just before the test: honestly, if your instructor offers such a thing, take it. I was worried it would tire me out but honestly being a bit tired was probably what stopped me from being too eager and kept me at a steady pace. It also allowed me to get all the silly mistakes out before my test, for example being a bit heavy on the acceleration/brakes because I had been using my parents car over the weekend to practice. Also I managed to talk out my nerves with my instructor (who is honestly exceptional) before my test, and she talked me through the process. We went through each of the manouvers, which all went perfectly, which was a big boost to my confidence before the test

- I kept on reminding myself: I am perfectly capable of passing the test. No matter how much I told myself 'it would be okay if I don't pass' it didn't touch my anxiety because I knew if I failed id have to go through the stressful process of rebooking, so reassuring myself of how hard I'd worked (I had been practicing since early this year) seemed to help. 

I seriously thought I'd failed at one point, because I didn't see a car coming towards me when I turned right into a side road that had parked cars all along the right side, but thankfully the examiner was in a good mood and let that fly (although she did tell me that I shouldn't have aborted the turning because I had already committed to it, so ill remember that for next time)

First time and only 5 minors, I'm pretty chuffed! I'm aware this is the very beginning of my real learning, but I'm so relieved to have finally passed 🙏🏼 I've had a lot of odds against me so I'm praising the wills that be that today went smoothly

I worked as a barista in college, and later again after moving to New York City, before landing my first full-time role. Since then, I’ve realized that traditional office work isn’t for me, I know I’m capable of running a business, leading a team, and creating an amazing coffee experience.

I’ve spent an enormous amount of time in coffee shops, working in them, working from them, and even spending entire days applying for jobs in them. I’ve seen firsthand what makes a great shop stand out. Over the years, I’ve developed a vision from the name, logo, merch, and menu to the roasters I hope to partner with.

I’m not looking to be talked out of this. I know it will be hard, but it’s my dream, and I’d rather try and fail than look back wondering what if. I also recognize that opening a café requires a lot of capital, permits, and planning, so I’m trying to understand where to begin.

Right now, I’m considering launching with a coffee cart or truck as a first step, both to start generating income and to build a customer base before opening a brick-and-mortar shop. Has anyone here had success with a cart model? I’m based in south Brooklyn, and that’s where I’d plan to set up.

Nobody ever thinks that word belongs to them. It’s something you call other people—the villains in your friend’s stories, the exes you hate-stalk online, the kind of people you swear you’ll never be.

But here I am. I cheated. And this is my side.


---

Before

When people ask why I did it, they expect one clean answer.

“I fell out of love.”

“I was drunk.”

“They cheated first.”


I wish it was that simple. It would be easier to live with.

The truth is messier. The truth is that it started long before the first kiss, long before the first late-night message. It started in the quiet months where I felt myself slowly disappearing inside my own relationship.

I was with my partner—let’s call her Dani—for six years. We weren’t married, but we were close enough that people kept asking us when. We lived together, shared bills, shared a bed, shared inside jokes and grocery lists and Netflix passwords. From the outside, we looked solid.

On the inside, we were… tired.

Not of each other exactly. Just tired of the version of ourselves we had become with each other. Everything was routine. The same argument on repeat: money, chores, my long hours, her scrolling on her phone, who cared more, who tried more, who was killing the relationship faster.

We weren’t yelling every night. It wasn’t some constant war. That almost would have been easier. It was the drift that killed us, the slow slide into emotional distance where you wake up one morning and realize the person lying next to you feels more like a roommate than a lover.

I’d come home from work late, step into the apartment, and the first feeling I had wasn’t relief—it was tension.

Her headphones in.
The TV on.
The sink with dishes “soaking.”

I’d say, “Hey.”
She’d say, “Hey.”
And that was it. Two letters each. That was all we could manage most days.

Sex became rare. And when it did happen, it felt like checking off a box labeled keep the relationship alive for one more week. No intimacy. No real connection. Just bodies in the same space doing what bodies do.

We tried to talk about it. To be fair, she did. She’d say things like:

> “You’re never here.”
“When you are here, you’re on your phone.”
“I feel like I’m not your priority.”



My side was:

> “I’m exhausted.”
“I’m trying to pay our bills.”
“I can’t be everything all the time.”



I’m not going to pretend I was some saint who tried his hardest and just wasn’t appreciated. I shut down a lot. I avoided hard conversations. When I felt criticized, I retreated into silence or sarcasm. She had her own ways of stonewalling—pulling away, turning cold, posting vague sad quotes on Instagram instead of talking to me.

We were a two-person team that had stopped playing on the same side.

And then came her.


---

The First Crack

Her name was Mya. She worked in the same building as me, different department. At first she was just… easy to talk to. That’s what everyone says, right? But she was.

We didn’t even start off flirting. It was jokes about work, making fun of the terrible coffee, complaining about the printer that kept jamming. Little things. Safe things.

One afternoon, I was microwaving leftovers in the break room. Mya walked in, dropped her bag on the table, and sighed like her soul was trying to crawl out of her body.

“You good?” I asked.

She gave me a half-laugh. “Just tired of going home to someone who doesn’t see me.”

The sentence hit me like a slap.

I didn’t say, “Same.” But something in my face must’ve answered for me, because she looked up sharply, eyes softer.

“You too?”

I shrugged. “Yeah. Kinda.”

That was the first moment I felt it—that little spark of being understood.

We didn’t jump into an affair overnight. It started with small things.

Longer chats in the break room.

Work memes sent over email.

Inside jokes about coworkers.


Then it moved off work channels.

Instagram.
Then text.
Then late-night texting.

I told myself it was just friendship. Just venting. Just someone to talk to who didn’t already have a whole history with me. No old arguments, no expectations. Just clean, easy connection.

But here’s the line I crossed long before any physical cheating: I started telling her things I should’ve been working out with my partner.

I told Mya I felt unseen, unappreciated.
That home felt heavy.
That I missed feeling wanted.

She told me the same from her side.
Her boyfriend was emotionally distant.
She felt like a ghost in her own apartment.

We became each other’s emotional band-aid.

People think cheating starts with sex. It doesn’t. It starts with secrets.

The first real crack—the one I can’t excuse—was the night Dani was asleep beside me and I was in the dark, phone brightness turned low, laughing at something Mya texted.

I remember looking over at Dani’s back, the rise and fall of her breath.

I remember thinking, If she saw this right now, would she feel betrayed?

The answer was obviously yes.

And I kept doing it anyway.


---

Crossing the Line

The day it became physical, it was raining.

Cliché, I know. But it was. One of those grey, miserable days where everyone at work seemed quieter, a little more fragile. My last meeting ran late, and when I came out, most of the building was already empty.

I was headed toward the exit when I saw Mya sitting at a table in the lobby, staring out at the rain hammering the glass.

“Hey,” I said. “You good? Thought you left.”

“My ride fell through,” she said. “I’m waiting on an Uber, but it’s like surge pricing times a thousand.”

I laughed. “Yeah, rain tax.”

We talked. About nothing, really. About everything, kind of. At some point, the conversation turned serious.

“I’m so tired,” she said quietly. “Not ‘I didn’t sleep’ tired. Just tired of feeling… alone next to someone.”

Those words could’ve come straight from my own mouth.

I don’t remember who reached out first. Maybe it was me. Maybe it was her. Maybe it was both at the same time. Our hands touched on the table and intertwined like it was the most natural thing in the world.

My heart was pounding so loud I could feel it in my ears.

“We shouldn’t,” I said.

“I know,” she whispered.

We didn’t stop.

The Uber never got called. I drove her home. We kissed in the car outside her place. It wasn’t some wild, movie-style make-out. It was soft, hesitant, like both of us were still waiting for reality to crash through the windshield and stop us.

When she pulled back, her eyes were glossy.

“This is bad,” she said.

“I know.”

We kissed again anyway.

That night was the first night I truly became what everyone hates. The villain in the story. The cheater.

I went home to Dani, who was half-asleep on the couch, a show paused on the TV.

“Hey,” she murmured. “You’re late.”

I kissed her forehead.

“Yeah,” I said. “Long day.”

And right then, I felt the first real wave of guilt.


---

Living in Two Worlds

You’d think the guilt would stop me. It didn’t. Not at first.

The thing about cheating is, for a while, you live in two different realities.

In one world, I was still Dani’s partner. We still did grocery runs, watched shows, made small talk. She still texted me memes. We still argued over dumb things—who left dishes in the sink, who forgot to switch the laundry. We still sometimes had sex, quick and disconnected.

In the other world, I was Mya’s “escape.” We texted constantly. We met up after work “for coffee” or “for a walk.” It didn’t stay PG. You can figure out the rest without me giving details.

I know what you’re thinking: If you felt so guilty, why didn’t you just break up first?

I’ve asked myself that a thousand times.

The answers aren’t good enough, but I’ll give them anyway.

I was scared of being alone.

I was scared of hurting Dani.

I was scared of blowing up our whole life—apartment, shared bills, families who knew us, mutual friends.

I was scared that if it didn’t work out with Mya, I’d have destroyed everything for nothing.


So I kept trying to have both.

Mya gave me attention, softness, excitement. She made me feel young again, wanted, seen. With her, I wasn’t the guy who forgot to take out the trash or who worked too late. I was the guy she was drawn to.

Dani gave me history, stability, a life already built. Her blanket on the couch. Her shampoo in the shower. Our years of inside jokes buried underneath the dust of unresolved fights.

In a twisted way, I loved them both—though not equally, and not in a way that honored either of them.

At night, when both worlds quieted down, that’s when the guilt hit hardest. I’d lie there next to Dani, phone in airplane mode, knowing I’d see Mya tomorrow, and feel this heavy ache in my chest.

I started snapping more at Dani. Not because she deserved it, but because I felt like a fraud every time she looked at me with anything resembling trust. Her smallest question—“Where were you?” “Why are you quiet?”—felt like a spotlight.

The worst part? I started resenting her for making me feel guilty.

That’s how far gone I was.


---

The Breaking Point

Cheaters get sloppy. That’s how most of us get caught. The truth is hard to maintain when you’re juggling two realities.

For me, the breaking point wasn’t a text she found or a random call. It was something much smaller.

We were at dinner—me and Dani—at this cheap taco place we liked. It was supposed to be a “let’s reconnect” kind of night. No phones, just us.

We were halfway through the meal when I zoned out, thinking about a conversation I’d had with Mya that afternoon. She’d said something about maybe leaving her boyfriend, about wanting something real. About wanting me.

“Are you even here?” Dani asked.

I blinked. “What?”

“You’re somewhere else,” she said. “You’ve been somewhere else for months.”

I looked at her then, really looked. She had dark circles under her eyes. Her hair was pulled back in a lazy bun. She was wearing the sweatshirt I bought her two birthdays ago, the one with the fading logo.

She didn’t look furious. She looked… tired. Scared.

“Do you even still love me?” she asked, voice barely above a whisper.

And I—coward that I was—dodged.

“Of course I do,” I said quickly. “You’re being dramatic.”

She swallowed hard, nodded, looked down at her food.

That moment split me in half.

On the Uber ride home (we’d both had margaritas), she leaned her head on my shoulder. I stared out the window, watching the city blur by, thinking, She deserves someone better than this. Better than me.

The next day, I told Mya we needed to slow down.

She stared at me in the car, hurt flaring in her eyes.

“So what am I?” she asked. “Just an escape until you figure your shit out?”

I didn’t answer, which was an answer in itself.

She laughed bitterly, shook her head. “You’re not the person I thought you were.”

I almost said, Neither am I. But it wouldn’t have changed anything.

We stopped talking after that. Ghosted, really. Two weeks later, I heard through a coworker that she’d transferred to another branch.

I thought ending that would fix things. It didn’t. It just left me alone with my guilt.



The Confession

Some cheaters never tell. They take it to the grave or to the end of the relationship, whichever comes first. I understand that choice, even if I don’t fully respect it.

Me? I broke.

It happened three months after things ended with Mya. I wasn’t seeing anyone else. I wasn’t cheating physically anymore. But emotionally, I was still distant, still half-invested in my life with Dani.

One night, she confronted me again—more directly this time.

“I feel like you’re here, but not here,” she said. “Something’s wrong. And I’m tired of feeling like the crazy one for noticing.”

I could’ve lied again. I could’ve gaslit her, blamed stress, work, my mental health. I could’ve done what I’d been doing for months.

Instead, the words came out before I could stop them.

“I cheated on you,” I said.

Silence.

That word, in the air between us, changed everything.

Her face went blank first, like her brain froze trying to process it.

“When?” she asked.

I told her.
“With who?”

I told her that too—at least the basics. I didn’t give details. I didn’t say “Oh, it wasn’t that serious” or “It just happened once.” I didn’t try to soften it.

I think part of me wanted to be punished. Wanted her to scream, throw things, break up with me on the spot. Wanted a consequence that matched the weight I’d been carrying.

Instead, she started crying quietly. Not dramatic movie sobs. Just… silent tears.

“I knew something was wrong,” she said. “I felt it. I kept telling myself I was paranoid.”

Hearing that hurt more than if she’d punched me.

“I’m sorry,” I said, uselessly. “I’m so sorry.”

“Why?” she asked. “Was I not enough?”

There it was—the question everyone who’s been cheated on asks. And the one I still don’t have a clean answer for.

“It wasn’t about you not being enough,” I said. “It was about me not knowing how to deal with my own shit. I felt alone. I felt unappreciated. I felt… dead inside. And instead of talking to you, I took the easy, selfish way out.”

“Do you love her?” she asked.

I shook my head. “I don’t even know who I am right now, let alone who I love.”

She looked at me for a long time like she was trying to see if there was anything left in me worth salvaging.

“Get out,” she finally said. “Just for tonight. I can’t look at you.”

I packed a bag and left. Slept on a friend’s couch. Stared at the ceiling all night, listening to my brain replay our conversation again and again.

The next weeks were hell. She told her sister. I told a close friend. We tried couples therapy. We argued. We cried. She asked for details. Sometimes she wanted to know everything; sometimes she didn’t want to know anything at all.

We didn’t survive it.

I moved out three months later.


After

People ask me now, Do you regret it?

Yes. A thousand times yes.

But I don’t just regret the cheating itself. I regret every little choice that led there:

the first secret text I didn’t mention

the first moment I chose flirting over setting boundaries

the first time I used Mya as an emotional crutch instead of facing my problems

the months of lying by omission

the way I made Dani question her own instincts


Cheating wasn’t a single decision for me. It was a series of small, selfish decisions that snowballed into something I couldn’t control.

The guilt didn’t disappear after the breakup. If anything, it got louder for a while.

Living alone was rough. No toothbrush next to mine. No extra shoes by the door. No “Hey, can you grab milk on your way home?” texts. Just silence.

I went through a phase where I tried to justify everything to myself:

> “We weren’t happy anyway.”
“She didn’t treat me right either.”
“Maybe this was the only way things were going to end.”



Some of that might be true. But it doesn’t erase what I did. It doesn’t turn me into “the good guy.”

What helped me move forward, slowly, wasn’t denying I was a cheater—it was accepting it. Owning it. Not as my whole identity, but as part of my story.

I started therapy. Not couple’s therapy. Just me.

My therapist never let me hide behind excuses.

“Yes, you were unhappy,” she said. “Yes, you felt unseen. Those are real feelings. But your choice to cheat—that was yours. You could’ve left. You could’ve spoken up. You didn’t.”

We talked about my fear of conflict. My need to be liked. How I avoided hard conversations until the only “solution” I could see was to escape into someone else.

She helped me understand something important:

> Feeling empty doesn’t make cheating inevitable. It just makes you vulnerable to making shitty choices if you’re not honest with yourself.



Over time, I stopped seeing myself as either “monster” or “victim.” I was just… human. Flawed. Capable of causing deep hurt and also capable of taking responsibility for it.

I wrote Dani a long letter I never sent, apologizing again—not to win her back, but to admit the full weight of what I’d done. I still have it saved. Maybe one day I’ll send it; maybe it’s enough that I wrote it.

As for Mya, we never reconnected. Occasionally I think about reaching out to apologize, but I’m not sure it would help her. She’s part of a story we both probably want to leave in the past.


Moving On

I’m in a new relationship now. It started almost two years after Dani and I ended things. I told my new partner the truth early on.

Not the gory details. But the important part:

> “I cheated in my last serious relationship,” I said. “I’m not proud of it. I’ve done a lot of work since then. If that’s a dealbreaker, I respect it.”



She sat with it for a while. Then she asked me questions—not just about what I did, but about what I learned.

I told her:

I learned that attraction to someone else doesn’t mean your relationship is doomed, but hiding it can be.

I learned that loneliness inside a relationship is dangerous if you don’t talk about it.

I learned that secrets are where cheating really starts.

I learned that you can love someone and still hurt them deeply if you’re not honest—even with yourself.

I learned that “I didn’t mean to” doesn’t undo the damage.


In this relationship, I do things differently.

If I feel distant, I say it.
If I feel attracted to someone else, I don’t feed it with private messages or “harmless” flirting. I let it pass, or I talk about the deeper reason I’m feeling disconnected.
If something’s wrong, I don’t disappear into silence. I try to show up, even when it’s uncomfortable.

Will I ever cheat again?

I want to say a firm, loud “No, never.”

But here’s the more honest answer:

I know now exactly how easy it is to slide into being that person if I stop paying attention to my own choices. So I stay aware. I stay honest. I don’t pretend I’m above it, like I once did.

That humility is what keeps me grounded.


Am I the Villain?

Sometimes, in spaces like the subreddit you’re reading this on, people want to label characters in their stories:

Cheater = Villain

Cheated-on = Innocent Victim


And look, I get it. If you’ve been betrayed, your pain is real. You didn’t deserve it. Nothing I’ve said here is meant to excuse what I did or what anyone else did.

But if you came here to understand why people cheat, this is my truth:

I didn’t cheat because I wanted to destroy Dani.
I didn’t cheat because she wasn’t “enough.”
I cheated because I was a coward. Because I avoided my own pain until someone came along who made it easier to run from it instead of face it.

Do I feel bad? Yes. I’ll probably carry that regret for the rest of my life.

But I’m trying to do something with it. To be better. To be honest. To never again let silence and secrecy turn me into the worst version of myself.

So am I the villain?

In her story, probably yes.
In mine, I’m just a deeply flawed person who did a terrible thing, learned from it the hard way, and is still trying, one day at a time, to be someone I wouldn’t be ashamed to love.

If you’ve been cheated on, you didn’t cause it.
If you’ve cheated, you’re not beyond redemption—but only if you own it.

And if you’re standing in that dangerous middle ground right now, texting someone you “just connect with,” hiding it from your partner…

Take it from me:

That’s where it really starts.
And once you cross that line, you don’t just hurt them—you lose a part of yourself, too.",1,1765213850.0,CheatedOnOrCheated,0,1.0,False
1phi07x,https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/1phi07x/first_powerlifting_meet_report_m41/,First Powerlifting Meet Report - M41,"**Summary**

I competed in my first powerlifting contest, mostly on a whim. It was fun. I am now the #2 ranked lifter for my age and weight category nationally. 

**Background**

Was a very active kid. If there was a group of kids playing sports, I joined in. I participated, not very well, in organized soccer, ice hockey and competitive swimming. I did well at figure skating and excelled at wrestling in high school and university until I got nerve damage in my arm. I did bjj and lots of muay thai. I picked up squash in my 20s and played at the club level, before stopping for a number of years. I’m currently near to top of C division, hoping to be at the top of it/bottom of B division this season.

Lifting wise I’ve used a variety of programs including my own bad linear progression, Ben Pollack’s Free Intermediate program, Deep Water beginner and Intermediate, Bullmastiff by Alex Bromley, 4Horsemen by Brian Alsruhe, I may be forgetting some others in there. I tend to cut with 531 5s Pro FSL. I'm pretty sure this is my 8th year of training. **I am 5’4” and 41 years old.** 

**Programming**

I had been planning to cut down to 165 lb for the squash season and noticed there was a meet near my house, that the competition weight category was 75 kg (165.4 lb), and there was a masters category (age 40+). So I decided the plan would be to speed my cut up, cut 1 lb a week for 10 weeks, and sign up for the meet. I didn't change anything else about my programming except for adding heavy singles 3 weeks out, and dropping volume at the same time. 

I did 531 1000% awesome with volumizing the secondary work. I took 1 deload week at week 7. During this time I also played and practiced squash 5 times a week. My schedule looked like this:

Monday: Squat based workout

Tuesday: Deadlift based workout + 30-45 mins squash practice

Wednesday: League squash match

Thursday: 1 hour squash practice

Friday: Bench based workout

Saturday: 1 hour squash practice

Sunday: League squash match

**Meet**

Weigh in was the day before the meet, on Friday. I went into the week weighing 175ish lb (75 kg), but ended up shedding weight during the week just because my body's default seems to err towards weight loss. Thursday night I had a light dinner, without any fluids. Friday morning, just a coffee. I weighed in at 73.7 kg (162.48 lb), well under. By that evening I shot up to 167 lb, and day of comp I was 165.something lb. 

My friend was kind enough to drive down and handle me for the meet. 

**Squat**

I decided to mail this lift in and save myself for possibly setting national records for this fed in the following two lifts. As a result, I smoked all my attempts. 

It went 142.5 kg (314ish lb), 142.5 kg (336ish lb), 157.5 kg (347ish lb).   
Honestly, I was probably good for 380 lb at least here. 

**Bench**

Oooh were there problems. My plan was to go for the national record on my third attempt, but I hit the rack hard on my first attempt and got stuffed as a result. I had no idea how that happened, so tried to set up lower for my second, but the same thing happened again! It was incredibly frustrating, since this was something that has NEVER happened before, and certainly didn't happen during warm ups. 

For my third attempt my buddy gave me a hand off, and I crushed it since it was still at opener weight. Sad to have lost the opportunity to try for the record. 

102.5 kg miss (226 lb), 102.5 kg miss, 102.5 kg success 

In talking to people afterwards, many told it me it wasn't my fault and that the Rouge rack is weird like that. Looking at the videos of the misses, it turns out the plates were hitting the rack and Jhooks and that's how I was getting stuck. 

**Deadlift**

The plan was to go for the national record here too. While I had done higher numbers in the gym, they were at 10 lb heavier and this would have represented my highest ever bodyweight ratio lift. So this was going to be a let's see how it goes type of situation. 

192.5 kg (242 is lb) so easy, 215 kg (474 lb) moved well, 232.5 kg (512.5 lb) sadly stapled to the ground. 

**Reflections**

Ended up with a 475 kg total, for a dots score of 344.6. Could have added to it had my bench not gotten messed up. Considering I still ended up with the #2 spot nationally in my categories for this fed in the squat, bench, deadlift and total at my first contest, this is not a bad result at all. That however may be more of an indictment of the masters category than a testament to my strength. 

Competing was a lot of fun. If you're thinking about doing it, I highly suggest you go for it! I think if I were to do one again I'd like to train specifically for it and see what I'm capable of, and once again gun for the actual records. I'd also like to get practice with the implements before hand so I can work out the kinks. Looking at you stupid bench press. 

In terms of recovery, I felt completely fine. In fact, the next morning I played my league squash match. Having just been moved up to Division 1 (my highest ranking to date), it was a doozy, but I performed very very well. Taking a game off my opponent was a surprise to me, and my losses were close games. I even had him nearly gassed out a few times during the match. ",7,1765213825.0,fitness30plus,1,1.0,False

Like, it is so obvious...","Hey everyone, I've been seeing a ton of awesome work and also a lot of posts from people who are just starting out and looking for advice on how to build a portfolio.

I see so many posts of people working on some made-up tasks like redesigning the Netflix UI or creating a concept brand for a local coffee shop. Guys, please, this is a very common (and maybe not so good) practice, but it often lacks the real-world constraints that clients bring. Redesigning these already established brands often won't help us find clients in the way we hope, because for handling clients you need to work with constraints, not just how well/pretty you can design (but yeah that is also a big part)

For those of you practicing and enhancing your skills, there are super helpful tools like [ nikharabrief•vercel•app ] and [ goodbrief•io ]. Use them! They provide us with constraints trying to replicate real-life scenarios, which is way better for your portfolio and skill development. It forces you to think like (maybe) a professional.

Keep hustling, and remember that a portfolio that solves real problems (even if they're simulated!) is one that gets eyeballs.

But this particular Hyatt hotel has some problems...

Parking: The Hyatt Regency Waikiki Beach has one of the worst garages, its a 10 floor, narrow garage with old but fine elevators. It is going to be difficult to drive up the ramp, especially if you have an oversized car. The drop off area is also pretty small.

Check-In/First Impressions: The reception is on the second floor, and you will either need to take an escalator or the Spa/Lobby elevator to get up there. My first impressions was that the lobby was giving true ""Hawaiian"" theme to me. I really liked the open lobby layout and the stunning water features/garden work. Check-in was very efficient, although I had to pay for parking, parking costed me almost $250-300. The receptionist also accommodated our high floor request, getting the room on the 37th floor.

Rooms: We had a 1 King Bed Full Ocean View, although it wasn't really ""full."" There are two towers in the property, Eva (the one I stayed at), and the Diamond Tower. I think you will have a better view of the ocean if you stay at the Diamond Tower, staying at the Eva Tower has the Diamond Tower blocking your view. The room felt pretty old, especially the bathroom. Although there was a Japanese toilet, a rarity in the states, there wasn't a walk-in shower, and there was only an older bathtub. The room was a little bit dusty, but it was pretty nice and spacious. Overall, the room isn't too bad, but it also isn't the greatest.

Dining: There were two main restaurants in the hotel, both located on the 3rd floor. The first night we ate at Swim, the restaurant that is closest to the pool area. The food was very heavy and filling, and the price was decent. The food was very creative, but more sort of the ""American"" restaurant on property. The other restaurant was Shor, which was the Asian/American type fusion. I personally preferred Swim, although Shor easily had the best ambiance. My favorite part of all that is not only the coffee shop, but they have a shop called Dylan's Candies which serves the best ice cream in all of Waikiki. It was so good I even tried to eat one in the morning, but they were closed.

Amenities/Activities: The hotel has a pool, and has daily activities for guests to enjoy such as traditional Hawaiian singers and dancers making a performance in the hotel lobby. While it isn't always there, they hire people from outside in order to perform at their hotel. It isn't a part of the Hyatt Regency Waikiki really like how it is at Hilton Hawaiian Village, but still its enjoyable on a vacation. There is also a spa with breathtaking views of the beach, and is also a street across from the Waikiki beach and a still wave section. There is also multiple ABC stores located inside of the hotel.

Final Thoughts: Overall, for $235 per night, I thought that this hotel wasn't too bad, but I was a little disappointed for this being a Hyatt Regency property. The views were really nice, but it was a shame that the rooms were a big let down. It is really disappointing that they don't have modern and clean rooms, unlike other properties such as The Prince Waikiki and Waikiki Marriott. If I absolutely have to stay here again, it would probably be the only time I would stay here, as this isn't the resort getaway I have imagined.

1phhwio,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1phhwio/8_subtle_signs_you_might_have_social_anxiety_and/,8 Subtle Signs You Might Have Social Anxiety (And TOOLS That Actually Work),"Ever canceled plans just to avoid small talk? Or rehearsed “thank you” in your head 10 times before ordering coffee? You’re not alone. Social anxiety isn’t just about being shy. It’s surprisingly common, often misunderstood, and seriously underdiagnosed, especially with how online culture romanticizes being an introvert while ignoring the deeper distress some people actually feel.

After diving into recent psychology research, mental health podcasts, and behavioral studies, I realized a lot of what influencers say about “social awkwardness” is just another recycled aesthetic. Real social anxiety is different. And it deserves actual tools, not TikTok memes and fake extrovert hacks.

So here’s the no-BS guide to recognizing 8 hidden signs of social anxiety, along with tools used by psychologists, bestselling authors, and therapists to manage it.

These aren’t just theories. They're backed by research from places like the National Institute of Mental Health, Yale’s psychology department, and clinical CBT studies. Let’s get into it.

- You replay conversations in your head hours (or days) later  
  You keep overanalyzing what you said, how you sounded, how that one person looked at you. Social anxiety often involves something called ""post-event processing,"" a phenomenon researchers described in the Journal of Anxiety Disorders as a repetitive, intrusive self-review loop. It’s exhausting and totally preventable with CBT skills like thought labeling and defusion.

- Your heart races *before* social interactions  
  Even if nothing bad has ever happened before, your body reacts like it’s entering a war zone just walking into class or attending a team meeting. This is a classic somatic symptom of social anxiety where your threat detection system (amygdala) is overactive. Dr. Judson Brewer explains this in multiple episodes of the “Huberman Lab” podcast, emphasizing how mindfulness can help retrain these automatic responses.

- You avoid eye contact but don’t know why  
  Eye contact feels… invasive. Or unsafe. This isn’t irrational. A 2017 study from Kyoto University showed that people with high social anxiety process eye contact as more emotionally intense, activating fear responses faster than in non-anxious people.

- You come across as “quiet” or “rude” when you’re just anxious  
  People think you’re disinterested, but the reality is you’re hyper-focused on not saying the wrong thing. According to Psychologist Dr. Ellen Hendriksen, author of the bestselling book “How to Be Yourself,” socially anxious people often over-monitor their speech and facial expression, which makes natural interaction harder.

- You pre-write texts and redo them 5 times before sending  
  Or you ghost people just to avoid having to reply. Social interactions aren’t just hard in person, they're mentally taxing even through text. Research in Cognitive Therapy and Research Journal found that even digital conversations can trigger anticipatory anxiety in socially anxious individuals.

- You overprepare for everything  
  Even coffee chats feel like a presentation. You script what you’ll say, rehearse answers in your head, memorize possible reactions. According to the UK's NHS psychological treatment reports, this over-preparation is a safe behavior. It reduces anxiety short term, but reinforces the idea that you “need” it to survive interactions.

- You cancel plans last minute even when you want to go  
  Fear overrides desire. You might genuinely want to attend that party, but 30 minutes before, your mind spins into catastrophizing or discomfort. Dr. David Carbonell calls this the “anxiety trick”: avoiding discomfort gives relief but strengthens the fear loop.

- You judge yourself way more harshly than others  
  You extend compassion to others. But for yourself? Every mistake feels fatal. This amplifies social anxiety over time. Kristen Neff’s research on self-compassion found that socially anxious people benefit significantly from practicing even small acts of self-kindness.

So, what actually helps?

Here are resources that people swear by, tools that are actually grounded in science, not Instagram therapy vibes.

- Book: How to Be Yourself by Ellen Hendriksen  
  This is the best social anxiety book I’ve ever read. It’s written by a clinical psychologist who also struggles with social anxiety, and it’s packed with empathy, research, and real coping strategies. NYT Editor’s Choice. The way she balances neuroscience and real-world behavior made me stop blaming my personality and start working on change. Insanely good read. This book will make you question everything you think you know about being “shy.”

- App: Finch  
  This gamified self-care app helps you build healthier coping habits. You create a bird avatar that grows as you complete small tasks like gratitude journaling, deep breathing, or CBT-style check-ins. Doesn’t feel clinical or boring, which is rare. Ideal for tracking small wins against anxiety patterns.

- App: BeFreed  
  An AI-powered learning app built by former Google AI experts and Columbia grads. It takes expert-level knowledge from psychology books, research papers, and therapist talks, and turns it into personalized podcast-style lessons. You can ask it for help with something like “how to handle social anxiety at work,” and it’ll generate an episode tailored to your goal and with examples, coping strategies, and even voice customization (yes, you can pick a soothing or energetic voice depending on your mood).  

  I’ve been using it during my walks instead of doomscrolling, and it’s helped me understand my anxiety patterns better and actually apply CBT and ACT tools. It’s like having a therapist and research assistant in your pocket. No brainer for any lifelong learner. Just use it and thank me.

- Podcast: The Anxiety Coaches Podcast  
  Hosted by Gina Ryan, who survived high-functioning anxiety herself. Episodes focus on short, practical advice that feels like a pep talk from a friend. I kept hearing it recommended on Reddit’s r/anxiety for a reason. It’s actually calming, not triggering.

- Website: Anxiety Canada  
  This non-profit site is a goldmine. They offer self-assessment quizzes, step-by-step exposure therapy guides, and downloadable CBT worksheets. Peer-reviewed, advised by leading clinicians, and it doesn’t try to sell you anything. Bookmark it.

- YouTube: Therapy in a Nutshell  
  Hosted by licensed therapist Emma McAdam, this channel breaks down anxiety tools in a way that’s both emotional and science-backed. Her series on “Overcoming Social Anxiety” is especially good. Easy to binge-watch but still learn a ton.

- Book: The Confidence Gap by Russ Harris  
  This ACT-based book shows how confidence isn’t the goal, action is. Harris writes clearly with zero fluff, diving into fear, avoidance, and the myth of needing to “feel ready.” This was the best book I’ve read on stopping the avoidance loop. It teaches you how to feel fear and still carry on. Critical for anxiety recovery.

- Tool: Insight Timer  
  This meditation and breathwork app has some of the best free guided sessions for anxiety. Unlike Headspace or Calm, it’s less polished but deeper. You can search for specific things like “morning anxiety” or “social fear meditation” and find real practitioner-led content.

As a taxi driver in Seoul, I always see the city from the road level. But looking down at the Han River and the apartment complexes from the Sky Lounge gives a totally different feeling.

The clouds and the sunlight hitting the river were breathtaking today. If you are visiting Seoul, I highly recommend coming here around 5 PM to enjoy a coffee and watch the sunset. It’s peaceful and worth the visit.

You can read the original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/zaA0RBrhVK

Thank you to everyone who left a comment or sent me a private message to talk.  I’m especially thankful for the comments from anyone with a scouting background.

I had already planned a vacation day for today since I have vacation I have to use up before the end of the year, so I wanted to provide some updates.

I wanted to answer a few questions that have popped up on the other thread to add some context.

A few people asked why I wasn’t involved in scouting and if there were things going on in my personal life that made me feel this way.  I was more involved in scouting when my oldest was a cub scout with my husband, but as my oldest crossed over into Boy Scouts, the time commitment increased.  I also don’t drive because I never got my license in high school, so my husband had to pick up the slack on that.  He really wants me to be more involved since our troop is now a mixed-gender troop and our daughter also joined.

My job also gets in the way of a lot of things. I teach a 4K program in a private childcare center.  That’s normally a lot of work, and it’s year-round. My summer is busier because public schools are out and we have more kids.  But this year has been harder than normal. We have a new curriculum, a new assessment we have to do on every kid, and the kids are harder because they’re either not prepared for my room or they have behavior challenges. I’m up until well after midnight most nights working on lesson plans or preparing for the next day’s activities. Although he tells me I shouldn’t work so hard if I’m not getting paid for it, my husband is mostly supportive of my job and will run errands for me and bring me coffee or lunch when I need it.  Our local library will ask him questions about the books I put on hold for my classroom because he usually picks them up.

Some of you DMed me to ask about intimacy.  I feel like my needs are being fulfilled.  I wasn’t sure if his needs are since his sex drive has gone up over the last few years. He had some health issues and was put on high blood pressure medication about 5 years ago, and he worked hard to get off of them within a year.  He lost weight and works out more.

After reading through a few other posts on here, I know this will come up.  He does not go to a gym. He works out on our treadmill and with some dumbells in our basement.

But he has never complained to me about intimacy.  He knows about some things in my past and doesn’t push. I’m sure he wants it more, but I’m not spontaneous and it’s hard to find time when you have 3 kids and a job that takes all your time.  That said, I am quite pleased with our sex life.

My husband was on a weekend scout outing with two of our oldest kids when I made that post, and he didn’t get back until later yesterday afternoon. I had a chance to talk to him and the troop’s scoutmaster yesterday.

The scoutmaster called me yesterday afternoon because she had a question about the shirt sizes my kids needed for the new activity shirt they’re ordering, and my husband was out of cell service at that time. During that conversation, I mentioned that the “married couple” comment that was made at the last parent meeting made me uncomfortable.  She understood and says she has been trying to stop that.  I asked her some questions about my husband and this other parent, and she said that they’re more like brother and sister than a married couple.  She says they joke around, but she hasn’t seen anything that looks like flirting between them.  They will sit next to each other at meals when the adults eat together, but she doesn’t see anything that makes her think anything is going on.

I talked with my husband last night. I approached the conversation by raising my concern about the married couple comments. He understood and said that he didn’t like them either. He knows that I can have some anxiety issues.

I asked if I could look through his phone.  He allowed me to.  I looked at their text history, and I didn’t see anything that would concern me. Their texts were all about scouting, a few book recommendations, a text or two about crowdfunded backpacking or hiking gear, and a text thread about some advice for a car issue she was having last year when her husband wasn’t around.

He also let me look through his other apps. His job involved stuff with computers before he got laid off, so he had a few apps like Slack and WhatsApp. He showed me WhatsApp, and the only messages were with people that are his former coworkers.  He also had Signal, which was locked with FaceID. He opened it without hesitation, and the only two conversations were with former coworkers who did something with computer security.

My husband also showed me his ipad and kindle.  I didn’t see anything on his iPad that concerned me.  When I looked at his kindle, I learned that he liked reading what he called “cozy romance novels” or “Hallmark movies in book form.” Our date nights usually involve a Hallmark movie or two, and he told me that he had to research books before borrowing them from the library or buying them on Amazon because he’s been surprised by how graphic some of the books get when the summary sounds extremely innocent.

After that, I asked him a question that I probably shouldn’t have.  But the DMs I received and another reddit post here made me curious.  I asked him if he masturbated.  He said he did, and he does it in the shower.  My husband takes long showers, so that filled in that gap.

Then I asked him who he thought about when he did that. He said he mostly thought about me.  Sometimes he thought about two musicians/actresses. It feels weird to actually post their names in a thread so I won’t say their names, but one was a late 90’s pop star who is now an actress (and voiced a Disney princess) and the other is a violinist.

After a few moments of silence, he also admitted that he had a fantasy about that other parent and had thought of her in the shower.

I wasn’t thinking when I asked my next question.  It just kind of came out.  I asked if he was attracted to her. There were a few more moments of awkward silence before he said he was.

But he also said he recognized that attraction and set some hard boundaries for himself.  He says he has kept his texts to scouting-related/adjacent topics and books (except for the one where he gave her car advice…that was just a text and he never went over there to help her because he was with me that entire day), doesn’t get into situations where he is alone with her, and just treats her like a friend. The only time he has been to her house is when he was picking her son up for scouting events, and he sat in the car in the driveway while our kids went to the door.  He does not meet with her outside of scouting, and when we see them at school band concerts or other school events, we rarely talk with her.

He also said that he is more attracted to me than anyone else and that he has made a conscious choice to not act on any feelings besides the feelings he has for me.

Since I had asked him about other people, he also asked me if I had been attracted to anyone.  I admitted that I think I am attracted to the parent of one of the kids I teach.  He knows that I only speak to these parents for like 5 minutes a day in the chaos of drop off and pickup and that I don’t connect with parents on social media until after their kids are out of my class.  He didn’t try to make me feel bad about it, and he said he only asked because I had asked that question of him.

So that is where we are at.  I think I’m feeling insecure about myself because this other parent looks like I used to before I had kids.  She’s skinny.  She runs marathons and backpacks and shares some interests with my husband.  But he’s enthusiastic about spending time with me and meeting all of my needs.  And he’s home every night with me and has always had location sharing turned on for me so I can always see his location.

Update: I should clarify something here.  When I asked the scoutmaster about my husband and this other parent, it was about how those married couple comments got started.  She filled in the details about how they interact. But I never told the scoutmaster that I suspected him of cheating.  Just that the comments that a 3rd parent made were making me uncomfortable.  I told my husband that I had that a conversation about those comments with the Scoutmaster.",55,1765213287.0,Marriage,36,0.97,False

I've had a long standing appreciation for more bitter, dark, bold tastes like dark chocolate and black coffee, while not liking overly sweet things.

Except in recent years, I have found I have not been enjoying dark chocolate like I once was. At first I thought it was just the brand I didn't like (example: Lindt). But after trying many different kinds over quite literally years, I have come to accept that maybe I just don't like dark chocolate any more. That perhaps my taste has changed. 60% seems to be my limit now, whereas I used to prefer over 70%. 

Dark chocolate tastes really acidic and astringent to me now, where it once tasted rich and deep. I know taste buds change as your get older, but I thought that was only growing from a kid to an adult, not in the middle of adulthood! Or is that not the case?

This is all really weird to me, has anyone else experienced this? Or is there maybe hope for me to enjoy it again? It makes me kind of sad because I want to be able to experience the enjoyment from dark chocolate that I used to have. Now I have an advent calendar that's half dark chocolate flavours and I genuinely can't eat them. I'm so disappointed... In myself!

I’m 31f, and been thinking about quitting forever since I was 28. 

I’m a chronic binge drinker, with an absurd tolerance. Last labs were okay, so naturally I kept drinking. Did the Cali sober thing for a minute until I had to move to another state where it isn’t legal.

Anyways. Saturday night I bought a 12pack of 9.5ABV IPA’s. Usually I stop once I’m drunk… but this time, I finished just about the entire pack.

My 2yo brought me two empty cans in the morning (when I usually would be up playing with her, her dad was up with her) and said “here’s your coffee mom, good morning”. I was hungover in bed, and knows I usually drink coffee in the mornings. I felt like a POS all around. Anyways.

I was taking videos of myself towards the end of the night, and put myself to bed.

Well, the next day, my walking heart rate was 150bpm. I note this because on the days I don’t drink, I hike up my STEEP ridge with my kid on my back (about 45lbs), and my heart rate won’t even reach 140 unless I literally race up the hill, it’s hard. I’m fortunate to have been prescribed propranolol for anxiety so I got my heart rate down.. but that’s not even the scariest part.

I watched the videos I took of myself that night… I watched and listened to myself (wearing AirPods at the time) and I could hardly breathe. My respiratory system was seriously compensating. It was terrifying, and I’m surprised I didn’t die in my sleep. I was audibly gasping for air. I don’t have asthma, and have had a recent echocardiogram showing my heart is fine (for now).

I don’t have anyone to tell, and it terrified me. I can’t believe I survived the amount of booze I consumed. 

I’ve struggled with sobriety for a long time, with many posts in the past. Been through therapy, tried medications, read some literature… nothing has stuck.

Here’s to day 3. I’m not drinking today. The thought of forever is too much of a promise, so just for today, I will not drink.

1phhla7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1phhla7/what_i_learned_this_year/,What I learned this year,"

As a 29m virgin who's always struggled with dating, I think I learned some valuable things this year:

1. You have to make intentions known fast. I went on around 15 hinge dates (only two were second dates) and I didn't flirt cause I had no idea how. Predictably, the ""no spark"" rejection followed. Additionally, if its someone irl, you need to make it clear its a date when asking them out. Just this weekend, I didn't do that and she brought her friends along for coffee. When I asked afterward if I could take her on a date to a cocktail place after she said we're better as friends.

2. When I did attempt flirting, it was awkward and I felt like teenagers would have been more successful than me. I don't know how I'll ever get better tbh.

3. Ask for clarity. I was pursuing a 43 year old I met at an event and after several subsequent hangouts, she was giving mixed signals. I tried to escalate my flirting until she finally said she didn't like me in that way and got very upset. Then we got drunk and she kissed me, though nothing else happened as I didn't want to have sex with someone who couldn't consent. That was my first kiss ever. This all could have been avoided if I had asked if she liked me as more than a friend during one of the hangouts.

4. Don't pine after someone for months before asking them out. It makes the rejection way more painful.

TLDR; intentions need to be made known early and I suck at flirting. Maybe 2026 will yield better results, who knows.

The aroma from the bag was fruity with red wine notes. I find it extremely well balanced. There’s a strong pink guava taste followed by a rich chocolate flavor.

I like to brew 40g of coffee at a time and usually grind coarser, 95 clicks on the KinGrinder K6, with a water temperature at 210°. My target brew time is 4:00-4:45 minutes.

The recipe I follow is:

• Bloom with 80g of water with a gentle swirl. Let it bloom till 1 minute

• Once 1 minute hits pour till you are at 220g of water. 

• At the 2 minute mark pour until you reach 400g of water.

• The final pour starts at 3 minutes to 600g of water. One last swirl.

It should be done around that 4:30 mark. Let me know if there is anything I should try out!

Can’t get a good cup,"Honestly this applies to several brewers I’ve tried, but using the Switch as an example because it should (hopefully) be the easiest to dial in with the least variables.

Coffee: Washed Light Roast from Honduras, 3 weeks off roast. (But this has continued to happen across several different beans and roasters. All light roast and I’ll open them 3 weeks after roast.)

Grinder: Ode Gen 2 (stock burrs). I’ve also tried with a 1Zpresso K-Ultra. 

Water: TWW Light Roast in distilled water (I’ve tried varying dilutions from 50%-100%). I’ve also tried Crystal Geyser bottled water and my home Britta. 

Temp: 93C

Ratio: 1:16-1:17

Filters: Cafec Abaca

Switch Recipe: Steep for 4 mins and release. 1-1:30 drawdown depending on grind size. I’ve also tried the Coffee Chronicler recipe to no avail. 

——

For the life of me I can’t get a good cup.

Most of my brews come out with this vegetal/cardboard taste and a ‘cooling’ sensation that lingers. This leads me to believe under extraction, which makes sense since I’ll start on the med-coarser end, so I incrementally adjust the grind finer (keeping all other variables the same). I can taste the coffee change, but it ultimately just goes from underextracted-sour to overextracted-bitter and never hits the sweet spot where the tasting notes pop. 

I’ve gotten close, only to lose it when I make the next incremental adjustment. I’ve had outstanding light roasts at cafes, so I know I like them. 

I feel like I’m overlooking something and it shouldn’t be this hard to dial in? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

1phhk1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1phhk1a/just_wondering_if_anyone_experiences_longcovid/,Just wondering if anyone experiences long-Covid symptoms as I do...,"December 2022-25: three years since it all began.  Reading through many posts on this forum I have yet to come across anyone with my same profile of symptoms.  It's almost certainly mast-cell related, but there is no good test, so I can't say for sure.  If anyone is out there to whom the below symptoms look familiar, I am interested in networking to discuss what has helped and not helped.  My symptoms:

1. Labored breathing, driven by carbohydrate intake (the more available the sugar, the worse the reaction).  If I fast for a day or part of a day, breathing is 95% normal.
2. Tachycardia, again drive by carbohydrate intake.  Again, fasting keeps it at my pre-Covid norm of 70 bpm.  I used to wake up about one second after falling asleep with horrible tachycardia (120 bpm) lasting one hour.  After I stopped eating carbs this also stopped.  These days, when I eat most anything (including small amounts of carbs) I feel a bit of vibration in the chest (vagus nerve?) for a few hours.
3. For the first few months after infection I felt a pressure in my chest.  This all but stopped when I went off all caffeine, only to return for a few minutes here and there.  Happily I am drinking some coffee again periodically without this.  I guess you could call this dysautonomia but why induced by carbs?
4. Alcohol intolerance: this is the confounding one.  Even a few sips of spirits or half a beer would send me into what felt like heroin withdrawal for 24-48 hours.  Absolutely not worth it and I haven't tested it in over a year.  No doctor has offered an explanation for this.
5. Lichenoid dermatitis (eczema; on the scrotum).  I cut tomatoes and tahini out of the diet and this is under control.  Eczema has been a problem my whole life, but tomatoes and tahini were always fine until LC. 
6. Tinnitus (mild, occasional).

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I have never experienced:

\-- Fatigue/ME-CFS  
\-- Brain-fog  
\-- PEM  
\-- Nerve pain  
\-- Gastro upset  
\-- Mood swings  
\-- Chemical sensitivities  
\-- Loss of taste & smell

I am able to run an 8-minute mile, deadlift, squat, travel abroad, and so on... the one thing I can't really do is eat. 

\*\*\*

What has helped?

\-- Cutting out carbs out of my diet took me way up the ladder: I feel 90% when fasting or between meals.  Absolutely no dairy, grains, sugar, starchy root vegetables, or soy.  I live mostly on meat, eggs, fibrous vegetables, avocados, legume products (for those of you who shop at an Indian grocery store, you know how many legume options there actually are).    
\-- Another thing that helped a little bit was taking five weeks of Larazotide (500 μ 2x day) + two tsp of L-glutamine 2x day.  I noticed some improvement in the foods I could tolerate after that.  
\-- I also would mention that I tried LDN a year ago.  My starting dose was 4.5 mg -- miraculously my breathing was 100% normal on day three, but my heart started doing weird things so I stopped immediately.  Had an EKG -- they took off the electrodes after five seconds and said there was absolutely nothing wrong.  The prescribing doc said it was premature ventricular contractions.  It was really hard to walk uphill for a month and then I was back to baseline again.  (Breathing, of course, went back to being labored right after stopping).  Tried LDN again a few months later starting at .05 mg but when I got to 2.5 mg I started feeling like napping all day.  So... LDN did SOMETHING, but not what I wanted it to do.  
  
Anyone out there having (or has had) a similar experience?  Would love to talk with you if so.

Carmelita And Wendy Give Sandy A Cryptic Warning.","Part 3 https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMerotica/s/Ri7gkzsgjy


Nora's Perspective

Time to count the tips my little bondage waitresses made in the Domme's lounge
We'd started strapping them to the bitchsuit carts and having the most obsequious, brown nosing Alpha Slaves maneuver the carts to tables and serve customers, following a long when more than a cart was needed.

Normally I let the bootlicking Alpha's keep 2/3 of the tips and put 1/3 in Zero's and Border Bunny's accounts with QOM. The explanation I gave to my slaves (Very nice of me, not like I owed them one) was they were just lazing around on the carts, the Alpha Slaves were doing the hard work.

Today, all the slaves were told is they got to keep all the tips. Of course, I'd dash their hopes by telling them they were feeling generous and wanted to donate to Roz's college age daughter Sierra. Yes, that bull dyke actually was married and had a kid with a man at some point. Sierra needed money for books, tuition and other expenses I told the slaves they were going to cover with ""voluntary"" donations.
I pretended to let slip to them that she was kind of a spoiled brat who squandered their donations on expensive things like clothes and partying. The powerless frustration in their eyes at my accidental slip of gossip was hilarious!

For the record I do fight for every penny they earn, I kept my promise! They can make voluntary donations to a girl's education! Even if they need a little persuasion, and the girl spends it on parties and designer clothes. Of course, there's somethings they don't know yet. I may reveal that part someday, if I can alienate them from our friend group and tighten my control. But right now it's a hilarious private joke between Roz, Sierra and I.

Speaking of jokes, I open the door and admire the two raised naked asses on the motorized carts, bitchsuited limbs immobilized, elbows and knees the cart. backs of their black hooded heads forced upright by posture collars. A Craftsman adjustable stool between Layla on the right and Sheila on the left. The breakout room has become my defacto office since I revealed my blackmail to them. Their lovely backs are my desks and work area.

I sense their nervousness when I come in, not sure who it is. ""Hi, girls it's Nora!"" Immediately they mmmph in near perfect unison, ""Eeetigs, Ishwes Ora! Ow aa or unerthy oser uts erve ooo?"" Greetings, Mistress Nora! How may our unworthy loser butts serve you?"" Almost in unison. ""Good coordination, but not quite perfect, girls..."" I let my statement trail off like I'm considering punishing them...sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.

I let the moment stretch, enjoying the sweat glistening so adorably on their beautiful butts. Finally I sigh, like I know I'm being indulgent but can't help myself. ""I guess...I guess I'll let it go this time. Aren't you girls lucky I'm such a merciful Mistress?"" Eager ""Eph, Iswess Ora! Ank ouo!"" These bitches once told me what to do. Now look at them. Pathetic.

I deem their gratitude unworthy of acknowledgement and move to Sheila's back, placing the coffee cup on her smooth bare, smooth skin. I like my Java lukewarm, it won't burn her. ""Zero, do not spill or break my Boss Bitch coffee cup or you'll be one sorry little hapa, cutie pie."" Of course it's actually her Boss Bitch coffee cup. Was. It's mine now, bottom bitch! I smile at the tremor of anger in her back muscles. But she says ""Eph, Ishwess Ora.""

Down to business, I unsling my pack and sit on the stool. Unzip it and pull out my gloves, putting them on. Pull out a mason jar of disinfectant, unscrew the cap, place it on the floor by the stool. I pull out the tip canisters from Layla's ass, then Sheila's.
I decide to use Layla's compact, beautiful muscled back as my counting desk today. I place them on her back, open them.

I toss the cash on her back (All bills, on the Queen Of Mean compound, tipping with change is declasse). I put the canisters and lids in the jar of disinfectant. Skin off my gloves and toss them at the trash. Perfect dunk! I use hand sanitizer to disinfect my hands, then the spot on Layla's back where I put the canisters. Then I pull out cocoa butter and lube up the butt plugs. I place one in Layla's butt, then turn to jam the other in Sheila's. This isn't just gratuitous cruelty. Their butts are lovely. Their gas isn't,
 especially while I'm counting.

Sheila sqeals and jerks a little, making the coffee cup on her back quiver. ""Bitch, I warned you about spilling my cup. Don't give me one of your servile answers, just stop squirming, whore!"" Another angry clench of muscles. Then she relaxes, staying wisely silent.

I sip the coffee and turn to count the bills.
""Sierra is really grateful you girls are willing to donate her all your tips today. She says she has an emergent expense she needs to pay immediately."" I sense by their breathing they're annoyed...but I know them well, they're not really suprised.

I'm disappointed, but it figures. They're both smart girls and experienced slaves. And they know me. They had to half expect the rug was getting pulled out from under their slave asses.

Don't worry, girls this little games not over for you, yet. They've never met Sierra yet. But when I was drunk (Just a little, though I played it up more) I showed them a recorded video call of her throwing a tantrum and calling them names like worthless ""Mattress Actresses"" and much worse. Screaming about how their paltry donations weren't enough for her. They know their ""donations"" are going to a totally ungrateful spoiled brat who takes their ""genorosity"" for granted. Not that they can do anything about it. Hee, hee.

Anyway, they're meeting ""Sierra"" on a little Zoom call on the big screen in here, today. She'll let them know just how grateful she is. I smother a giggle of anticipation. They don't need to know, just yet.

I finish my counting on my little Mexican's back, all three of us silent. When I'm done I make a point of stretching and groaning, flexing my casual freedom over my restricted, uncomfortable slaves.

""Five hundred fifty girls. Four hundred for Sierra. One fifty to pay my Platinum dues for the Domme's Lounge. I really appreciate your genorosity, girls."" Sullen silence and ragged breathing. They're getting pissed at this game. It gets better girls! For the Dommes anyway!

""I said, I appreciate your generosity girls, don't be rude, would you be like this with Roz or another QOM Domme? With Constance or Lara? Answer me with enthusiasm, bitches...or I just might reh
gret being such a merciful domme."" My voice is hard and dangerous...warning. I slap Layla's bare butt with my hand, swivel, grab my coffee, and slap Sheila's. Then I lean back against Layla's side, sipping my coffee and waiting.

""Ur ekcome, ishwezz Ora! ere appy ooouu ive a ooo sk!"" Layla exclaims hastily. Your welcome, Mistress Nora! We're happy to give anything you ask!"" Sheila quickly adds ""Ooo ay un, ooo as, Ishwess! Anyun, Ishwess!"" To anyone you ask, Mistress! Anyone, Mistress!  Even ungrayeful little brats who disrespect us is obvious though unsaid.

I frown. ""Zero, Layla answered first. Your lag is nearly unforgiveable. Border Bunny. should I punish her? You keep quiet, Zero.""
A slight hesitation, but Layla knows a mind game demands a quick answer. ""Ets er erogaive, ishwess."" It's your perogative, Mistress. Good reply, actually. Respects me, without throwing her friend under the bus. I could probably make her say ""Yes."" But I have no reason to turn them against each other...not yet.

""That's right it is, but I'm still feeling merciful today."" Then I giggle, lightly and playfully slap their nude butts, and sip coffee. ""Relax, you two...I got to be hard on you...even in private sometimes...so we don't get lax...it's still me, you're friend, Nora, looking out for your delicious, cute butts."" I sip my coffee as they sit thinking in confused silence. My tone says we're all friends here...the stark imbalance in freedom and power say otherwise. Mindgames working...even on two women who should see through them.

Then Layla tenatively asks ""Ishwess Ora?"" I sip my coffee and then say sweetly, ""Yes, sweetie?"" She replys ""Ishwess, a eeee ooo eee?"" Mistress, I need to pee. Sheila chimes in with ""Ishes? Eeese eee ooo?"" Mistress? Can I please pee, too? I give the most put upon sigh, even though the buckets are a foot away to the right. ""Oh, okay..."" I groan dramatically. ""After I text Sierra about the amount of your generous donation. Sure she'll give you a big thank you."" I suppress another giggle. She'll let them know how she feels, alright. Or pretends to feel.

I take my time sipping the last dregs of coffee and texting. I know the slaves want to groan at the way I casually make them wait...but of course, they don't dare. Finally, I put my coffee back on Sheila's back. I put my phone on Layla's butt cleft right over the butt plug. By the way she's twitching, I can tell that's where her cramped muscles are the most uncomfortable. It will be worse for her trying to balance my phone. ""Don't drop my phone, loser."" I warn, the threat is implicit by now.

As I get up to retrieve their piss buckets, a truly, wicked delicious idea. Sierra is going to text me soon acting angry at my ""stingy slaves"". I can give Sierra an extra bit of power over them and add to their misery.

Before I plant the buckets, I warn ""No peeing until I get back. I see a drop of yellow in these buckets, you get one stroke of the metal braided flogger. Across your areolas after I clamp your nipples. Understood?"" I wince just imagining it, I know the slaves don't want to test me. Two chorused ""eps, Ishwe Ora."" replys 

""Thanks for reminding me I have to pee, girls."" I get up and stretch lazily, more casual groans. ""Freedom and power are such wonderful things, girls. Someday you'll experience them again. Someday."" I giggle, feeling the anger, humiliation and discomfort, probably pain. stewing in them. Marinating in their own helplessness, just how I like my slaves.
I leave for the ladies room. I take my time coming back. Stopping to talk to two domme trainees about the weather. When we finish I look at the watch Dave insists we all have, ""On the clock"". According to him people are too reliant on their easily wrecked phones. Ten minutes, wow. Sierra had probably texted by now. I still stroll as slow as possible back to the room.

When I enter they immediatley start to mmmph for permission to pee. I bark ""No! shut up, you're both under a gag order not to address me until I give you leave. And you do not have permission to pee! I have some important things to take care of, so I may delegate that authority."" Nervous silence.

I pick up my phone off Layla's butt and my coffee off of Sheila's back. I casually look at my texts.

Sierra: Those stingy losers! Only four hundred dollars. One hundred short of what I need! I have had it with them. Mistress Nora, with respect, I want to talk to your selfish slaves as soon as you can arrange it!

I walk around so I can see their eyes beneath their black hood masks and panel gags. Casual sip of coffee while looking at phone. ""Uh-oh. Sierra's not as impressed with your generosity as I thought she'd be. She's actually pretty mad, wants to talk to you girls ASAP. I'll see if I can calm her down."" I sound unruffled and unworried. Because of course I have nothing to worry about. They don't look afraid, yet. They've never met Sierra. That's about to change. They do look nervous and wary, as my gag order keeps them silent trying to avoid a squeak or moan.

Mistress Nora: Okay, Sierra, I'm actually here with them now, though I have to leave soon. We're in the breakout room with the big VTC screen. Is that satisfactory? 

Sierra: That's fine, I have my laptop. Look forward to meeting the losers...this is going to be fun!

Mistress Nora: For us, girl!

Sierra: Ha,ha, ha.

I say to the slaves ""Sierra is going to Zoom us on the VTC. She may not be a domme."" You may have guessed that's a lie, folks. ""But she is a free woman, vastly superior to your plugged tails. Be respectful."" I hold up a hand to stall their reflexive mmmphimg. ""Still under a gag order, girls.

I start up the VTC with a keyboard on a side desk. ""Princess Sierra"" is ready and waiting. The VTC is huge and Sierra's giant image will be glaring down on the hapless bitchsuit slaves. Just how I set it up.

I hit a key and she appears. long blond hair with pink highlights, attractive face that would be beautiful without the bratty pout and glaring eyes. Nose ring and hoop earrings. Pink motorcycle Jacket. White Eagle T-shirt that looks cheap but knowing her costs at least one hundred. Designer Jeans. The image of a spoiled, untouchable Gen Z Princess, carefully crafted.


Her pout becomes a little suprised, then curves into a cruel smirk. She's a good actress, I idly wonder if I could write a part for her on the Perseverance.

My cue. I step forward. ""Hi, Sierra. I'm Mistress Nora. This is my Slave Zero"" I gesture at the mixed asian girl. And this is my other Slave, Border Bunny. We're really glad to meet you, Sierra. I understand you're a little upset at my slave's donation to your education?""

She acts like she's peering closely at the bitchsuited girls. ""That is the most pathetic pair of human beings I've ever seen in my life. They actually let you do that to them? They really are losers.""

I laugh and pat Layla's hooded head with my left, Sheila's with my right. ""They have seen better days, they used to be my mentors and role models. Let's just say they're paying back a favor I'm doing for them, boosting my career so I keep a secret. I like to think of them as temporarily embarrased winners."" I smile sweetly.

Sierra snorts with contempt. ""Whatever. I just see losers. Who can't fucking pay up to a real winner properly!"" She starts glaring angrily at both of them again swinging her head back and forth from one to the other. I should tell them to cast their eyes down, but the look of growing terror in them at the bratty girl's wrath is so funny.

I say calmly, ""Tell me the problem, and maybe we can find a solution."" The problem solving domme.

""I'll text it to you."" She sends me a picture of really nice Girotti ladies boots. For 500$. So far the script is solid. ""Oooh, those are nice!"" I exclaim. ""I see why you're mad being one hundred short.""

She acts like she loses very shaky self control. ""Because  these selfish, worthless losers are not working hard enough!
I'm tired of them! I'm telling my Mom!""
Their eyes get more anxious as she yells at them. The threat to tell her mom, one of the most powerful dommes in the compound, finally makes them afraid.

I stay calm and collected, moving so I can monitor my slaves' pretty eyes. ""Listen, Sierra, there's a reasonable solution that doesn't involve bothering your mom."" I pull out my wallet. ""They made five fifty, I took out one hundred fifty for Platinum Club Domme Lounge Dues since I spend so much time here now. But I can put this back in your donation envelope. Fifty still gets me Silver Club, free breakfast at least, I can make do."" I held out the money like a peace offering. ""And if you want to be mad at someone, be mad at me, not my slaves, they suffered a lot for your damn boots."" I put some steel in my voice.

The sllaves looked suprised and impressed I'd be honest and stand up for them like I promised. For a moment I basked in their approval like they were my mentors and I their protege again. I remember one of their ""Good job, Nora!"" compliments meant more than Master Ken treating me to all my favorite comics when I impressed him in bed.

Then cold, hard anger hits like a brick. You pathetic butt plugged freaks! When have I not been steady and honest, bitches? How dare you act suprised now! My conscience starts in ""You're literally putting on an act to manipulate them and..."" I shut it down. Sociopaths don't need a conscience. I stare expectantly at Sierra.

Her acting is solid. She acts suprised this mousy comic book nerd she would have picked on in high school has the nerve to get between her and a couple of bigger losers. She makes a show of looking at me closely, like she is reevaluating me. Then she speaks like politeness and courtesy are a language she knows, but is not that fluent in.

""Nora.... Mistress Nora. I mean no disrespect...to you. I appreciate you persuading your lazy slaves to donate to my...education. I see why you are a rising domme, you're not just hot and popular, but you have a steel spine. I don't want your money...and that one hundred is really YOUR money, not theirs. My mom would pay the extra one hundred for the ""damn boots"" if I ask her. That's not the point. Your slaves need to pay, one way or the other.""

I look at her quizically, like I don't get her drift. ""Your slaves should make enough for your needs and any causes you want to donate to. Like my...education."" She smirks slightly. ""If they're not punished for my boots, they should be punished for falling short on your Platinum Club dues. You have every right to DEMAND they do both.""

I look at the slaves, who's eyes are pleading with me, ""Don't listen to her Mistress Nora. Please!"" I want to laugh at their desperate, pathetic silent begging. I almost give away the act with giggling. I keep a grave considering look as I turn back to the screen.

""My mom says you're a great domme, could be the next Queen Of Mean, someday."" I put a lot of gee whiz credibility in my reply. ""Really?""

Sierra nods on screen. ""Yes. She says you're one stumbling block is your soft spot for these two pathetic butt plugged freaks. She says they're not your friends anymore, your one of the cool kids now, and they're a couple of hooded Pariahs. Look at them, they're a couple of pieces of furniture with plugged assholes.""

I look at them and think of Border Bunny my work desk, and Zero, my coffee table. She's right. I turn back to look at her and we share an unscripted giggle at the slave's expense. But it seems to fit naturally into the act.

When we finish, I give her a stoic expression. ""I don't know about them being furniture and Pariahs, I'm standing here largely because of them. But-"" When I say the last word, I'm not looking at the slaves, but I can tell from her smirk she is. I think saying they're not happy is the understatement of the year.

""But they agreed to do a favor for me, in return for covering for their cute butts, figuratively speaking. I've been too lax in disciplining them. That's on me. They are experienced players who've knowingly taken advantage of their knowledge of the biz and my friendship to slack off."" I turn to pin them with a domme glare, gratified to see their terror. ""That's on me, and it stops...NOW!""

As Sierra nods her approval, I showily look at my watch. ""Look, Sierra, good talk. I needed a reality check. I'd love to stay and chat, but I got an appointment at the Domme Botique for some hair highlights. I have to call the Junior Domme Of The Day to find a sitter for these losers...so, how about this time I just slip five hundred in donations to you and...""

""Sorry to interrupt, Mistress Nora. I can watch them from here while I call my mom to help calibrate them. We can work out the extra shifts they need to work during their scheduled freetime to cover my boots. You keep your Platinum Lounge dues, Mistress Nora.""

""If you're sure, Sierra?"" Big predatory smile, ""I'm positive Mistress Nora."" I look doubtful. ""What can you do except yell and make fun of them?"" The wicked grin gets wider. ""I was a high school mean girl, Mistress Nora, I can make a tongue lashing really hurt. Not that-these two- are much of a challenge. And when my Mom gets here..."" Now I look back at the horrified slaves as we share a chuckle.

""Oh, okay, if you're sure you have things under control here. And call me Nora, all my friends do. My REAL friends."" I say with cruel emphasis. ""Mistress is for the little slaves here."" I wave my hand at them absently, like they're trash.

""Go, enjoy your boutique appointment, Nora, nice to make a new friend."" Warm, sincere smile. I return it. ""Thanks, likewise."" I let the slaves catch my eye silently pleading again as I make to rush out and act like I just remember something.

""Uh, Sierra. The slaves need to pee, I haven't granted them permission, yet, though their buckets are ready. I'd like to grant you authority over their bladders, do you think you could....""

Sierra grins with suprised delight at the little bit of extra power I grant her. ""I accept. No, they can't pee, they don't deserve to. Hold it, worthless slaves!""

We share a knowing, wicked smile. Then I turn to the slaves and shrug, irtitated. I tried bitches, I have things to do. A rising domme looking good is more important then a couple of stupid slaves' bladders. I act like I'm rushing, but smile as I hear Sierra savagely verbally lashing the miserable helots.

Princess Sierra is a Findom as a side hustle, it pays her school fees with plenty left over. She is really Roz's daughter, though she keeps their connection as discreet at school as her side hustle. The apple didn't fall too far from the tree.

She's a straight (mostly) girl who prefers men. But when Roz and I offered her a chance to relive her high school mean girl days by tormenting and extorting a couple of helpless losers, she leaped at the chance. I can't believe I ever thought I was one of the good guys. Being Evil is more fun!

Sandy's perspective

So relaxing to just sit and drink Carmelita's coffee at the card table in the kitchen. Catch up with her and Logan. The scene Brad is shooting with Sarah, Jaime and Wendy is Kimchi Girls take on BBC. Sarah and Jaime Cho are playing body stockinged Korean Dommes who bully a naked Wendy Chang into sucking that douche Brad's big black cock.
Tame by Ari's standards if racy by ours. I figured I could leave Jasmine in charge to give her some real leadership experience. I know from unpleasant experience Brad nuts quick when his dick is in a helpless girl's mouth. Poor Wendy, but at least she can swallow his load and be done. Of course my phone buzzes with Jasmine's number.

""Sandy come quick, something scared Wendy and she ran away crying and locked herself in a den naked. Sarah convinced0 Wendy to let her in and is trying to talk to her. Jaime is tugging on the locked door, Sarah and her are yelling at each other in Korean, while Wendy sobs. The men are standing around like useless clods."" Big suprise there. ""No one is listening to me."" No shock about that either
""Come quickly, Sandy!""

""On my way, Jasmine."" Shut off the phone. ""Logan, call our security team then head down to the shooting room after me."" A befuddled look. ""Logan!"" I shout. The young redneck fumbles with his phone. ""Uh, yes, ma'am, Miss Sandy."" That boy needs to speed up his brain sometimes.

Just before I leave, Carm grabs my wrist. ""Sheila and Layla are in trouble, so is Nora's soul."" What the-they're all safe roleplaying at the QOM compound. Dave decided that's best for them. Sheila and Layla are liabilities as helpless slaves here. Nora is....an unpredictable hot head. Lara told me she flagged her own teamates repeatedly with her weapon, and accidently shot a tied up Sheila. When Ari challenged the Perseverance crew to a paintball match. a fucking paintball match. Lara (Team Leader at the time) chewed her out and nearly took away her weapon. No one is trusting her anywhere near a real gun.

Why is Carm being so cryptic, now? I've learned to trust...her mysterious...hunches.  But why bring it up now? I lightly pull away my wrist. ""Um, thanks, Carm. We'll talk more, later. We may need your help with Wendy."" A grave nod, I look into eyes far too deep and wise for a woman just shy of thirty.

I head down to the shooting room at a run. Brad standing by the couch with an amused grin, watching Jamie bang on the door and yell at Sarah. I can hear Sara yelling back. At least they're speaking English, now. Jasmine just wringing her hands, and not such a badass domme when the slaves aren't tied up.

""Get out here, and bring that other little slut with you. You're nothing special, just a disgraced family shame and slave! Come out and bring that other disgraceful girl with you!"" Sarah yells back ""Sheng ya ma!"" or something similar. She tells us it means low class person. ""You're a slave, too, bitch. And you get fucked by your own..."" I yell ""Enough!"" No telling how this might escalate if that ugly fact is spoken aloud.

Yeah, Jaime's and Wendy's master Christopher Cho is also Jaime's son. Not even her stepson. Her biological son. I know, ick. I guess a guy who'd beat up his girlfriend and business partner, Wendy, and force her to do degrading porn, is capable of anything.

Fortunately, I'm authoritative enough, apparently, to silence the room. I walk up to the Korean MILF in a crotchless body net and nothing else, looking at me nervously. I shove her roughly aside, with a harsh ""Move, slave!""
She sputters, ""Mistress Sandy, I-."" I point at an Ottoman, ""Shut up and sit down!"" She hastily obeys. It must gall the former proud Asian Matriarch to be ordered around by a young half breed girl. But I guess all those lessons from the best Dommes, Ari, Constance, Layla. Even my big sister, Sheila, paid off.

Brad says ""Aww, how cute, the little sucky sucky girls are fighting. Why don't you boom boom babes munch Daddy Brad's big...""

""Shut up, Douchebag, you nut and go soft in like five seconds."" I snap. He just smiles. ""Little ol Pekinese ass and pitbull mouth. Weren't so tough when I was making you blow the horn, sugar."" I ignore the innuendo and knock on the door. ""Sarah? It's Sandy. are you and Wendy alright?""

""I'm fine. Wendy seems to be having some kind of breakdown. I'm not opening the door until our security team gets here."" I reply ""I support you on that.""

Of course, Ari's team gets there first. ""What the hell is going on here?"" Yells Caleb, Ari's racist, misogynist chief of security. Brad shrugs and says ""Some kinda chick thing. Maybe rice burner girls all have the same time of the month.""

Caleb side eyes the black man, apparently just on principal hearing one speak. I speak up. ""Wendy Chang had a breakdown and ran into this den. Sarah is trying to get her to come out."" 

Now Caleb looks at me with a small smile and does a small bow, tipping an invisible hat, since Ari won't let him wear his indoors. ""Miss Sandy, ma'am. We keep missing each other. Right nice to see you again, sweet thing."" The most courteous racist, misogynist redneck this side of the Mason Dixon Line.

Then his scrawny, much dumber redneck buddy Cletus speaks up ""Ah why'd we have to come down here cuz some little gook gal is bleeding out of her you know what. Fucking women cry and whine cuz they broke a nail...""

""And fucking short dicked redneck men scream like sissies when nicked by a little buckshot."" I shot back. Caleb and the other rangy rednecks laugh while Clete reddens.

I'd winged Clete with a shotgun blast when I escaped from here a little while back. Barely grazed him and he carried on something fierce. Considering he roughly shoved his dick in my mouth when he had the chance, I'd say we're even.

Clete doesn't see it that way. He takes a step toward me. ""You little...."". Caleb holds him back. Just then our own team skids up. A mix of combat vets from Vietnam to the most recent Middle East conflicts. The two groups of tough men eye each other warily. Ari and the Perseverance are technically allies, for now. But we are both angling for a fatal blow while we had our foe the closest.

Then Logan comes in with Carmelita behind him carrying a bundle of clothes. The redneck boy holds up a phone, yelling. ""I called Missus Ari, she wants to talk to ya'll."" Ol Logan finally using the good brain the Lord gave him.

Ari's scolding voice. ""Can just one of you fucking clowns tell me what's going on? Or did you all just decide to have a clusterfuck to mess with me?""

I speak up, pushing down my hate for my back stabbing former friend. ""Wendy had a breakdown of some kind. Sarah is comforting her. I suggest you have one of your medical staff look at her and give her a few days off even if she's cleared.""

Carmelita speaks up. ""Miss Ari, I have clothes for the girl. I make her good food and hot cocoa. If she too scared to sleep with her Master, I have extra cot in the servant's quarters."" 

Ari's voice turns syrupy with ersatz sympathy. ""Poor little thing. Of course Carm, take care of her, she can take off as much time as she needs. Mistress Sandy, thank you for stepping up. You too, Logan. The rest of you, get back to work, Dave and I don't pay you to stand around!""

Carmelita had gotten Sarah to let her in the room, presumably they were helping Wendy get dressed. Caleb, Clete and a few rednecks linger around. I'm grateful Logan and some of our security do, too.

Caleb hooks his thumbs in his belt and looks me up and down. ""You're a real take charge kind of gal, ain't ya? Bet that old fancy pants boy you're with can't get a word in edgewise.

""And like I said the last time we met, you're a racist, misogynist prick who disgraces all rednecks. You may not be an educated man, but you're intelligent and well read, you have no excuse."" 

He nods in that maddenly amiable way of his. ""So you say."" He keeps appraising me. I'd be less disturbed if it was sexual to be honest. Instead it feels like he was sizing up an opponent. ""The little gal with the big pair of balls. As I said before, a one on one between you and I might get real interesting, baby doll. I ain't never said that about no woman before.""

Just than three women come out of the den. Wendy in jeans, cheap T and sneakers. Carmelita to her left. What drew the most male attention was Sarah, wearing the same revealing crotchless, body stocking as Jamie Cho, who'd already scurried off.

Our guys had the decency to avert their eyes after a brief glance. The rednecks leer and whistle. Cletus yells.  ""Hey, Seoul Sally! We're white men with big dicks and lots of money for boom boom. You want to come down to our cabin and love us long time tonight?"" Ugly tribal laughing from Ari's men.

The beautiful former Navy Officer ignores them with grave dignity. Carm glares right at Clete. ""Your abuela is ashamed, she raise you to be good, God fearing boy. She still watching you."" Now Clete turns pale and gets really quiet. So do the rest of the rednecks.They finally started sauntering off.

Caleb still maintains his composure. Tips his invisible hat to us and says, ""ladies."" like a perfect Southern gentleman.
I spy a blanket on the couch that doesn't look soiled by.... you know. I quickly grab it and wrap it around my pretty Korean friend, who clutches it and nods gratefully.

Then Wendy reaches across her to grab my wrist. Suprisingly clear eyes peer at me. ""Sandy, Sheila and Layla are in trouble, and Nora's soul is in danger."" Sarah looks shocked and concerned. Carm just looks at me knowingly.

I get a take charge demeanor to cover my shock as Wendy lets go of my wrist and her eyes dull again. ""Carm, Sarah, get her to the kitchen, and get her fed after the nurse clears her. I'll be up shortly.""

As they lead the shuffling Wendy off, I pull out my phone and stare at it. Who should I call to check on my sister and two friends? The agnostic girl who hasn't set foot in a church since she was thirteen, suddenly gets the urge to ask God to protect them, before she does anything else.

1phhgob,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1phhgob,lululemon members’ Holiday Shop review,"hi all! attended lululemon members’ holiday shop just now and here’s my review and experience. soho broadway i believe is the new new york flagship and the new store layout isn’t my fav for shopping but it sure is great for browsing! the event started at 9am, i arrived around 9:20am and was worried about the crowded when i remembered that it’s a monday morning (lol) the door was locked since the store officially opens at 10am but they scanned my eventbrite code at the door and there were about 3-4 people just browsing around.  they had a bagel+coffee station which i obviously helped myself to!!  
here are the items i tried on: 
-Define High-Rise Wide-Leg Pant Luon in Black size Small
-Groove High-Rise Flared Pant Warm in  Black size 4
-lululemon Align No Line High-Rise Pant 25” in Black Size 4
-Fleece High-Rise Running Tight 25”in Kite Geo Emboss Black Size 6
-Flow Y Bra Light Support, C/D Cup Evolve in Black Plum Size Small
-It’s Rulu Long-Sleeve Shirt Updated in Dove Grey Size Small  
-Women’s SwayDay Mule in All Colors Size 8 

Thoughts on Items: 
The Define Pants were high rise and way too lose, I didn’t care for the mid rise I tried on last time. People suggested to size down for grooves and the No Lines I’m a size 6 typically but I also think I lost a bit of weight. Size 4 fit nicely for both but I have shorter legs so both were a bit long. I hated the thermal leggings, size 6 fit way too tight and the print wasn’t flattering on me. They feel like thermal tights I would under a dress not leggings for running. I tried on the thermal ones last time and they were smooth and warm but I didn’t want to get the 28” hemmed. The Flow Y Bra Evolve was terrible! There was this oattrious bundling of fabric on the band and it looked like cheap ruching.  Absolutely love the Rulu fabric so this top was nice, warm, and comfortable. Was super into the Mules but the educators were a bit busy to bring out my size so I just tried on the display ones. Was tempted to buy the white chargefeels because of the 25% off. 

What I bought: 

-Groove High-Rise Flared Pant Warm in  Black size 4 for $66
-It’s Rulu Long-Sleeve Shirt Updated in Dove Grey Size Small for $96

Then I felt unsatisfied and went back and got the Unisex Daily Essential Quarter Socks 3 Pack in Riverside/Sheer Violet/White Size M for $28.50. 

Thoughts and Comments
-Educators didn’t really greet me when I walked through the door on the first floor. They ignored me the entire time when I was on first floor. Educators on the second floor were fine, friendly and helpful expect the person at the front of the fitting rooms. She was rude, snarky and pretended to be busy looking at the stock on the device when someone asked a question. 

-Call me petty but I was sad there wasn’t cream or milk for the coffee. There was also no where to pour the coffee out and people were struggling juggling around items and their cup since there were no lids. People awkwardly sat next to and behind the refreshment table. The food also wasn’t labeled which can be a concern to some people. Don’t get me right, everything was still super delicious and delightful to have!! 

-First 50 Plus and Pinnacle Members get a free customized water bottle. There were way less than 50 members total, it felt like a good 35 max so there really wasn’t a rush for the water bottles. I chose the Back to Life Sport Bottle 18oz Straw Lid in Blissful Pink. We could get a print and text just like we can online. I wanted my text horizontally on the bottom of the bottle but that wasn’t an option. The whole thing took about 10 minutes and I ju look browsed the store while I waited. They set out a table specifically for the customization which wasn’t there the last time I visited the store. I think the person at the table was the manager or a senior educator, he always is there when I’m shopping at this location. He chased me down and let me know that the text printed vertically down the bottle in smaller font than I wanted but I didn’t particular care since it was a free water bottle! He put it a bag for me, but not a holiday shopper. 

-At 10AM, the general public started to flow into the store and they were offered the refreshments and discount too. SoHo is a very touristy destination so the store felt more lively instantly. There were lot of bored boyfriends and husbands. When I was trying on the display mules, I sat down on the ottoman (which was like a plastic rock sort of situation) and the whole thing wobbled and I almost sent someone’s dad flying!! I felt so bad but we laughed it off… Any member that walked in during 10AM-11AM was also entitled to the 25% off up to 15 full prices items. We could make more than one purchase and use different payment methods/ make gift receipt purchases which was nice. There were Macarons by the checkout. 

Closing Remark:
I will say I enjoyed the event overall. I could shop peacefully without worrying about the NYC crowd. Discount was nice but this store didn’t have a great selection, it was more focused on the newer drops. Wish I could use it on WMTM but this doesn’t even have a WMTM section anyways which sucks because they used to have a huge area for it. Overall I liked that they had food and free bottles. I know other stores are doing a free gift with certain purchase thresholds. I think your store and really make or break the experience. Seems like lululemon is planning plenty of more events focused on community in the future!!

Ron Gardinski here – full disclosure up front: I’m the author, slightly antisocial, guy who wrote these books.

  
Back in September 2025 I got fed up with the usual gatekeeper nonsense (degrees, networks, “experience required”) and decided to see if I could build real, usable career roadmaps using nothing but prompts and a lot of coffee. 96 books later (with 65 more queued), that experiment turned into the “From Zero to…” series.

Right now the first 5 are in the final days of their KDP free promo, so they’re 100 % free to read or keep forever in KU. Instead of just dumping links, I figured I’d tell you why I wrote each one and give the single tip I still use daily from it.

1. From Zero to Coder (last day free today) I wrote this because every “learn to code” book I tried assumed you already knew half the stuff. This one starts at literal zero and ends with a portfolio that has landed readers $80k–$120k remote dev gigs. Tip I still use: the 30-line personal expense-tracker bot. I run it the 1st of every month and it saves me hours of manual tracking. [https://amzn.to/4nHdQFi](https://amzn.to/4nHdQFi)
2. From Zero to Closer (4 days left) I hate sales calls. This book is the exact script I built to close high-ticket deals without sounding like a sleazy guru. Tip I still use: replace “What’s your budget?” with “What does success look like for you 6 months from now?” – flips the whole conversation. [https://amzn.to/3WJJqqY](https://amzn.to/3WJJqqY)
3. Zero to Leader (3 days left) Going from solo creator to leading people felt impossible until I wrote this. It’s the playbook I wish I’d had when I hired my first VA. Tip I still use: open every 1-on-1 with “What’s one win this week?” – takes 60 seconds and team morale went through the roof. [https://amzn.to/4oucLC9](https://amzn.to/4oucLC9)
4. Zero to Automated (2 days left) This one is pure selfish laziness – Python bots that do the boring stuff for me. Tip I still use: 5-line pandas script that merges 40 spreadsheets into one dashboard in seconds. Excel is now a foreign language to me. [https://amzn.to/4oW2BK2](https://amzn.to/4oW2BK2)
5. Zero to Manager (just went free today – full 5 days) Project management with zero prior experience. Agile, timelines, budgets, the whole thing. Tip I still use: the Friday “5-15 report” – 5-minute win + 15-minute plan from everyone. Cut my status meetings by 80 %. [https://amzn.to/47HQiKy](https://amzn.to/47HQiKy)

All $0 in KU right now. Grab whichever ones look useful before the promo ends.

If you do pick one up, I’d love to know what you think – good, bad, or “this tip is trash” – I read every review.

Also, the 177-prompt pack I used to write the whole series is free here if anyone wants it: [https://forms.gle/9vKjYk9yXbYkD9pV8](https://forms.gle/9vKjYk9yXbYkD9pV8)

I’ve been going to the gym for the last 5–6 months. I’m 26 years old, 6'1"", and around 83 kg.

Here’s what my current protein intake looks like:

* **Pre-workout (6 AM):** Banana + coffee
* **Post-workout:** Chapati, and later oats (around **25g protein**)
* **Lunch on non-veg days:** Chicken with rice and gravy (**\~25g protein**)
* **Lunch on veg days:** About 100g paneer (**\~20g protein**)
* Rest of the day is just regular home-cooked food.

I don’t like eggs much – I can manage only 1–2 because of the smell.  
I want to increase my daily protein intake but I’m not sure what else to add.

**Any suggestions for easy, affordable protein options?**

Earlier on, there was obvious mutual attraction strong eye contact, playful teasing, good chemistry, long stares etc. She even initiated a lot of it at first.

The confusing part is how her behavior has shifted. It happens in cycles: when things start to feel closer or more personal, she pulls back. She’ll take hours to reply (sometimes 8–24 hrs), go cold, and even flake when I suggest something simple like grabbing coffee.she once initiated hangjng out after work and flaked last minute.Then when I pull back and stop initiating, she suddenly becomes friendly again, starts bantering, and keeps the connection alive just enough.

It feels like she wants me around but at arm’s length  not rejecting me, but not letting it progress either. I’m trying to figure out: did she lose interest, is there someone else, or is she deliberately keeping distance because of age/religion and thinking it can’t go anywhere?

I don’t want to look needy or keep pushing something that isn’t there, but I also don’t want to play games or misread what’s going on.

Has anyone dealt with something similar?
Should I back off completely, communicate directly, or just stay casual and let her come to me?
Is there any hope here?

I am looking for advice. For years I used the basic magnifica automatic machine which took care of everything, grinding settings almost finest, coffee amount max.

Switched to La Specialista Maestro Coldbrew a month ago and I am struggling with the settings. I have arabica coffee and want to prepare it according to the guide. 

Settings: Double dose, Dose 15, Grinding 8 (slightly above the middle). And already the machine is struggling with pressure going way over the top.

I feel like this is weird, I want to set higher dose, and decrease the grain size to be able to prepare a decent americano or coffee. For espresso, it's halfway okay-ish. Not what I would expect from such upgrade.

Is there someting I am doing wrong? Please advise.

1phh62m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1phh62m/did_i_screw_up_by_not_staying_the_night_at_her/,Did I screw up by not staying the night at her place?,"I (30M) met a 29F on the apps two weeks ago. We didn’t live close to each other (2 hrs  away). But we had a conversation about that and agreed to still meet up. Essentially, she lives in a city semi-close to where my family and friends live. So I told her if things went well we could meet up on weekends near her because I could stay at my parents who live 45 mins from her. I also told her I was looking into moving back closer to her city since like I said, my family and most of my friends live in that area. 

Went on a first date for coffee and it went great. No kiss at the end, but we did hug. After that she seemed really invested in me, texting daily and responding quickly. She also FaceTimed me a couple times during the week. 

Went on our second date yesterday. She had tickets to a concert and wanted me to go. We had dinner and got drinks before that. She seemed into me, and initiated physical contact (holding hands, touching each other’s thighs/legs, etc.) She also made me cookies that she gave me, again a clear sign she liked me. 

Earlier that day, she texted me and said I could spend the night if I wanted so I didn’t have to drive all the way back that night. I told her we would see how late the concert went on because I had to work in the morning. 

By the time it was over, it was pretty late. And I still had to go pick up some stuff from my parents house. So rather than drive back to my parents in the morning, and then drive even more back to my place for work (which would amount to about a 2 hr 30 min drive), I decided it would be best to drive 45 mins to my parents that night, and then leave for work from there in the morning.

So I told her that at the end of the date essentially as the reason I couldn’t stay, but did say I would have loved to stay, and then I offered to come see her the following weekend on Saturday and then I could stay the night. She seemed happy with that and said yes, then we kissed for the first time. She seemed into that as well. Then she texted me on the way home and asked that I let her know when I got home safely. 

I texted her when I got home, and now it has been radio silence on her end. It’s been almost an entire day. Which normally I wouldn’t be too fussed about, but it’s a definite change in her texting pattern (was texting me back quickly and enthusiastically the past two weeks). 

Am I reading too much into this, or did I screw up by not spending the night? I just know in the past when the texting communication frequency changes it’s usually not a good sign. Plus I do like her a lot so I hope I didn’t mess up. ",5,1765211968.0,Bumble,7,1.0,False

1phgy6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1phgy6n/my_take_on_tunisia_a_very_archaeological/,My take on Tunisia (a very archaeological perspective),"At the end of November–beginning of December I travelled solo through Tunisia for two weeks. After seeing a recent and popular post warning people off Tunisia, I thought it useful to share my take: it differs on some points, agrees on others, and is probably more archaeological than most people want. Perhaps some might find some use in the latter.  

My travel purpose was purely touristy and very archaeology-themed. I am an archaeologist with an odd, very peculiar and specific interest in amphitheatres (which explains the places I visited). I speak some French; my Arabic is non-existent. I did meet a few people who spoke English, but only in the main cities. I didn’t rent a car and mostly used louages (a shared mini-van). They were great: cheap, frequent, serving virtually all places, and I never felt unsafe in them (the drivers are maniacs though!). For reaching more obscure places, I sometimes took a taxi from a nearby louage station (again, no issues here).

I never got properly scammed (perhaps the minor rise in the price of a coffee from 1.5 dinar to 2 dinar, which of course I was fine with). The only real headache was an Airbnb owner who claimed I broke a €100 microwave, although there was no microwave in the room to be found. Hotels were generally fine (€15-35 a night at this time of year, often including breakfast), but note that hotels are very limited outside the main towns on the well-known booking sites. It’s worth googling around a bit and emailing places directly to check availability and prices.

As said, I mostly (perhaps purely?) visited Tunisia to visit many of its great archaeological sites. Because access and travel practicalities aren’t always obvious, I’ll give a short overview at the end of the post. I myself benefitted from other people’s reports and hopefully this in turn helps others.

But first my biggest issue with Tunisia. What struck me most was the sheer amount of trash. Literally everywhere there is rubbish, even at fairly remote and culturally significant sites. Ancient Roman amphitheatres and circuses are used as dumps; even old Punic tombs were filled with trash. When I looked up older photos of the places I visited (let’s say 20 years ago), there was no rubbish to be seen. I cannot see this attitude changing in the coming time. Cleaning the country would be a Herculean task when the problem is this widespread.

Overall, there seems to be very little care or interest for the country’s great heritage and natural landscapes. I understand the economic crisis, but in other countries I’ve visited people seemed to care much more about preserving their sites and nature (despite poverty). Carthage, for example, is world-famous yet poorly maintained (the local museum has been closed for a long time). Many archaeological sites (Uthina/Oudna and Sufetula/Sbeitla, for example) had maintenance workers openly hunting for old coins to sell. At El Jem, I had to stop several seemingly local teenagers from inscribing their names on the amphitheatre walls. This is a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of Tunisia’s most famous monuments; similar vandalism in Rome’s Colosseum was worldwide news two years ago. Here it barely raised an eyebrow. It honestly felt quite depressing.

I never felt truly unsafe, although some youngsters in smaller towns could be annoying — once stones were thrown at me. I don’t speak Arabic, but the anti-tourist badmouthing was obvious enough. They mostly seemed bored and with little to do. Apart from that, people were generally helpful, especially when I needed directions or help getting back from obscure places.

Addressing a few other complaints I’ve seen online: yes, the trains are rubbish, but that shouldn’t surprise you if you’ve read up beforehand. Tickets are very cheap, so what do you expect? Hotels I stayed in were fine. Tunisia is not everyone’s cup of tea: it requires flexibility. I didn’t plan too much ahead: twice I travelled to sites that should have been open according to websites but were closed for maintenance or lack of visitors. I typically left early for a day trip and returned not too late (mid-afternoon) to find a louage.

The archaeological remains are amazing and often under-visited; the people can be generous and helpful; public transport is cheap and functional if you accept its quirks. The saddest part was the rubbish and lack of heritage protection. It detracts from otherwise extraordinary places. If you’re into archaeology, Tunisia is worth the trip. If you want great infrastructure, pristine cultural/historical/natural sites, and guaranteed English everywhere, maybe go elsewhere (but good luck finding that combination).

Below are my notes on archaeological sites. I ranked them rather arbitrarily from “must-see” to “only if you’re weirdly into this” (that is me).  

**Sufetula (modern Sbeitla):** absolute gem. Not the most famous or visited site. When I went here in late November, I had the place to myself (apart from the above-mentioned illicit coin hunters). You get a great view of Roman town planning and there are some very well-preserved temples. There is a little museum as well. It is one of those places where you can walk around for hours and constantly see new things.

Travel: I took a louage from Sousse to Sbeitla (15.5 dinar). It’s a long ride of about three hours, including a coffee/smoking break. The site is about a 20-minute walk from the louage station. Leave early as it might take a while for a louage to fill up (I arrived at the louage station around 06:00). Make sure to not leave too late (I left at 14:00).

**Dougga (near Téboursouk):** closer to Tunis and therefore attracts more tourists. It’s located on a hill and the town planning is much more chaotic since it follows the natural landscape. This makes it great to walk around as it is not always clear how to get to a particular building or viewpoint. I spent a lot of time at this place. Do not confine your visit to the key buildings. I walked towards the north, where there is a farmhouse still being used today (you’ll see farmers driving around on scooters on the old Roman roads). Even further north, you get a great view of the landscape and you will find even more ancient megaliths and various Roman tombstones dotted all over the area. Aim for the location of the Roman circus on Google Maps if you want to see those outlying features.

Travel: I took a louage from Tunis (Bab Saadoun) to Téboursouk (don’t remember the price, but less than 10 dinar?). From here you can get a taxi. I paid 20 dinar for a taxi to a place a bit further south of Dougga, where one of the more obscure archaeological sites is located (Agbia; you can skip this). I stayed in a hotel in Téboursouk (hotel Thugga; about €40 per night, which included breakfast and dinner).

**Chemtou/Simitthus (near Wadi Maliz):** definitely not a popular site. Nearby Bulla Regia seems to attract way more tourists. This is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that I spent half an hour at the local police station explaining why I was walking around Wadi Maliz (I was just hungry!) before visiting Chemtou. Chemtou is mostly known for its marble quarries, which supplied marble for many monuments in Rome. The landscape is simply stunning as are the huge quarries. There is even a camp where the forced labourers of the quarries were kept. You get a great view from the nearby hill. There is a nice theatre as well. The museum is very informative. It was co-designed by the German Archaeological Institute and in good German fashion it contains a lot of information. Again, I was the only visitor.

Travel: I spent a night at a horrible Airbnb in Jendouba (avoid this place, I’m not going to name-and-shame him, but he’s a ‘doctor’), and took a louage to Wadi Maliz. From here I took a taxi (10 dinar) to the site. On my way back to Wadi Maliz, I got a ride with the National Guard, who were already informed by the police about a weird tourist roaming around. You’re probably better off calling a taxi or walking to the main road hoping to find a taxi or louage to either Wadi Maliz or Jendouba.  

**Thysdrus (modern El Jem):** yes, touristy, but a must-see. The big amphitheatre is comparable to the Colosseum and equally impressive. Whereas the Colosseum is always busy, you will find fewer tourists here off-season. You can walk around fairly freely. Don’t skip the local archaeological museum (included in your ticket to the amphitheatre), which has amazing mosaics. There is in fact another amphitheatre at the town (an older one), which is left to rot. It’s near the louage station; just walk by it for the fun of it. There is also a big Roman circus in El Jem, which is now a dump. Best to skip that one.

Travel: I took a louage from Sousse (6.8 dinar). There is also a train running between the two towns. The big amphitheatre is a short walk from the louage station and the museum is even nearer.

**Carthago/Carthage**: I was a bit in doubt where to place Carthage. Yes, it is incredibly famous, but it didn’t deliver a huge “wow” for me. I ranked it high mainly because it’s a very easy visit from Tunis and because it deserves better than its current state. The site is in fact a collection of fairly isolated places scattered between the modern town, which makes it difficult to get a sense of the greatness of ancient Carthage. The Baths of Antoninus are worth a visit, and so are the amphitheatre, the tophet (an old burial place/sanctuary), and the area with Roman villas. The big cisterns were closed during my visit, but I hopped the fence. A very impressive construction!

Travel: theoretically, there is a train running from station Tunis Marine to Carthage, but the trains are currently not running. Instead, there is a crowded bus for 1 dinar that does the short ride.  

**Thuburbo Majus (near El Fahs)**: a fairly big archaeological site, which has a variety of buildings. It falls between the organised layout of Sbeitla and the more natural/chaotic structure of Dougga. There are (parts of) various gates to be seen as well as both domestic (small houses to bigger villas) and public architecture (bathhouses, temples). It is one of those places where you feel like you can ‘discover’ things, especially on a quiet day (again I was the only visitor). In the amphitheatre, you can see reused cippi (stone monuments with inscriptions) poking from the ground.

Travel: I took a very early train from Tunis to Pont du Fahs station (4.5 dinar if I recall correctly). A louage will be quicker (this costs a bit more, but not much). From El Fahs you can either get a taxi or walk for about an hour. I chose to walk and was stopped and inspected by the police (twice!). I took a louage back to Tunis.

**Uthina (near modern Farch Annabi)**: a quirky site not too far from Tunis that gave me mixed feelings. It boasts a massive temple and amphitheatre and various other buildings. The cisterns have been recently renovated (covered by very ugly modern concrete) and were closed during my visit (with a proper gate, unfortunately). The visiting centre is oddly large for its purpose (just ticket sales), but maybe they’ve got big plans. At Uthina I felt watched a lot. Guards were constantly driving around on quads, I had my passport thoroughly checked at the entrance, and various people were just ‘randomly’ roaming about. I walked back to nearby Farch Annabi with someone who proudly explained that he robs Roman tombs (“many coins!”). Charming.

Travel: I took bus 25 from Tunis (small bus station at Rue Tourcoing) to Farch Annabi for 1 dinar. From there it’s about a half-hour walk to the site. You can walk through the fields for a short-cut if you deem it safe (I did so on the way back). To get back to Tunis, I took one of the shared taxi vans running to Naassen and then from Naassen back to Tunis.  

**Bulla Regia (near Jendouba)**: this is one of the more famous archaeological sites in Tunisia and there were more tourists here than at many of the other places (although still not many at this time of year). I wasn’t massively impressed by it. The main selling point are its houses with an underground level that have in situ mosaics. Impressive indeed, but after visiting several other places I didn’t find much else that made it stand out. There is a nice theatre and a hill you can walk up for a good view over the city. And yes, there’s a place to get coffee, which is equally important.

Travel: it’s easily doable as a day trip from Tunis (louage from Bab Saadoun), but leave early and make sure you return on time. I visited it the day after Dougga via Téboursouk-Beja and Beja-Jendouba. From Jendouba I took a taxi (5 dinar) to Bulla Regia and returned to Jendouba by shared taxi for 2.5 dinar. I stayed the night at Jendouba.

**Pheradi Majus (modern Sidi Khelifa)**: one of the sites that was unexpectedly closed. It’s halfway between Tunis and Sousse, yet I can’t imagine it attracting many visitors as it doesn’t compete well with the better-known sites at similar distance. The landscape around it is stunning though. Despite being closed, I could catch a good glimpse of the place since – as is typical for many sites – it is not fenced. There is a triumphal arch and various buildings. Note there were people working at the site, so visiting while it’s closed is at your own risk (but I couldn’t be bothered to return immediately after taking a very early morning train).

Travel: I took a train from Tunis to Bouficha (6 dinar or so) and from there a shared taxi to Sidi Khelifa. To get back you can either go to Enfidha (there are no afternoon trains from Bouficha) or take a taxi from Sidi Khelifa to Bouficha. At Bouficha, options are very limited. I took a taxi to Baraket Essahel and from there a louage to Tunis. Even if it reopens, you might find this site not worth the trouble if you rely only on public transport.

**Thignica/Aïn Tounga**: another site that should have been open but was closed. I was stopped by the site’s guardian after he saw me stepping out of a bright yellow taxi (so much for camouflage). He told me the site is currently/indefinitely closed for “security reasons”. Probably the real reason is low visitor numbers since everyone flocks to nearby Dougga. This is a pity because Aïn Tounga has a nice arch, a theatre, an amphitheatre, a bathhouse and other buildings. The guardian kindly allowed me a half-hour visit, but I can easily see someone spending two hours there.

Travel: you wouldn’t travel to Aïn Tounga without combining it with Dougga, so it’s best included during a long day trip or with an overnight stay nearby.

**Leptis Parva/Thapsus**: I visited these for their historical significance, but I can’t imagine anyone going to Leptis Parva specifically (there’s hardly anything left to see apart from a very ruined amphitheatre). Leptis Parva was a primary base for Julius Caesar during his war against Pompey the Great. Thapsus (the site of a famous battle) has an amphitheatre which is currently neglected, but it’s close to the sea and pleasant to visit. You might want to combine the two if you’re in the area.

Travel: Leptis Parva is fairly close to the train station of Bouhjar (on the local line from Tunis to Mahdia). They run roughly every hour. From Bouhjar I took another local train on the same line to Bekalta. It’s quite a long walk to Thapsus (an hour), so you might want to find a taxi if you consider visiting it at all. I’ll mostly remember Bekalta because I had to wait more than three hours for a train that should have run every hour.

Finally, don’t skip the Bardo Museum if you are in Tunis. It holds some very well-known artefacts from pre-Roman Carthage, many mosaics from the Roman period, and artefacts from the period following the Islamic conquest. In Sousse, the Archaeological Museum holds very impressive mosaics from Hadrumetum (now part of Sousse) and El Jem.",3,1765211455.0,solotravel,1,0.8,False

Less than six months ago, I moved to a new city to live with my partner, and although I love the time I spend with him, I want to make friends on my own so that we can both have time for ourselves.

I recently met a girl (24) through TikTok (yes, unconventional, I know) and I've been meeting up with her for coffee, but this weekend we met up with my partner and a friend of his (both 31M). During the evening, the girl didn't stop talking, she did so quite abruptly and when I tried to make a comment she always cut me off. Towards the end of the night, I made a comment to my partner (because he had been a bit rude to a waitress) and this girl told my partner not to worry, that it wasn't a big deal, and then she looked at me and said, ‘You're a bit thin-skinned, aren't you?’ Perhaps I should have waited until we got home to make that comment to my partner; I think I made a big mistake there, but her comment really upset me because of the way she said it. I ended the night feeling small and strange.

The thing is, when I look back on the other times we've met, I've always ended up feeling strange and feeling like I couldn't talk.

1phgtp3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1phgtp3,My take on Tunisia (a very archaeological perspective),"At the end of November–beginning of December I travelled solo through Tunisia for two weeks. After seeing a recent and popular post warning people off Tunisia, I thought it useful to share my take: it differs on some points, agrees on others, and is probably more archaeological than most people want. Perhaps some might find some use in the latter.  

My travel purpose was purely touristy and very archaeology-themed. I am an archaeologist with an odd, very peculiar and specific interest in amphitheatres (which explains the places I visited). I speak some French; my Arabic is non-existent. I did meet a few people who spoke English, but only in the main cities. I didn’t rent a car and mostly used louages (a shared mini-van). They were great: cheap, frequent, serving virtually all places, and I never felt unsafe in them (the drivers are maniacs though!). For reaching more obscure places, I sometimes took a taxi from a nearby louage station (again, no issues here).

I never got properly scammed (perhaps the minor rise in the price of a coffee from 1.5 dinar to 2 dinar, which of course I was fine with). The only real headache was an Airbnb owner who claimed I broke a €100 microwave, although there was no microwave in the room to be found. Hotels were generally fine (€15-35 a night at this time of year, often including breakfast), but note that hotels are very limited outside the main towns on the well-known booking sites. It’s worth googling around a bit and emailing places directly to check availability and prices.

As said, I mostly (perhaps purely?) visited Tunisia to visit many of its great archaeological sites. Because access and travel practicalities aren’t always obvious, I’ll give a short overview at the end of the post. I myself benefitted from other people’s reports and hopefully this in turn helps others.

But first my biggest issue with Tunisia. What struck me most was the sheer amount of trash. Literally everywhere there is rubbish, even at fairly remote and culturally significant sites. Ancient Roman amphitheatres and circuses are used as dumps; even old Punic tombs were filled with trash. When I looked up older photos of the places I visited (let’s say 20 years ago), there was no rubbish to be seen. I cannot see this attitude changing in the coming time. Cleaning the country would be a Herculean task when the problem is this widespread.

Overall, there seems to be very little care or interest for the country’s great heritage and natural landscapes. I understand the economic crisis, but in other countries I’ve visited people seemed to care much more about preserving their sites and nature (despite poverty). Carthage, for example, is world-famous yet poorly maintained (the local museum has been closed for a long time). Many archaeological sites (Uthina/Oudna and Sufetula/Sbeitla, for example) had maintenance workers openly hunting for old coins to sell. At El Jem, I had to stop several seemingly local teenagers from inscribing their names on the amphitheatre walls. This is a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of Tunisia’s most famous monuments; similar vandalism in Rome’s Colosseum was worldwide news two years ago. Here it barely raised an eyebrow. It honestly felt quite depressing.

I never felt truly unsafe, although some youngsters in smaller towns could be annoying — once stones were thrown at me. I don’t speak Arabic, but the anti-tourist badmouthing was obvious enough. They mostly seemed bored and with little to do. Apart from that, people were generally helpful, especially when I needed directions or help getting back from obscure places.

Addressing a few other complaints I’ve seen online: yes, the trains are rubbish, but that shouldn’t surprise you if you’ve read up beforehand. Tickets are very cheap, so what do you expect? Hotels I stayed in were fine. Tunisia is not everyone’s cup of tea: it requires flexibility. I didn’t plan too much ahead: twice I travelled to sites that should have been open according to websites but were closed for maintenance or lack of visitors. I typically left early for a day trip and returned not too late (mid-afternoon) to find a louage.

The archaeological remains are amazing and often under-visited; the people can be generous and helpful; public transport is cheap and functional if you accept its quirks. The saddest part was the rubbish and lack of heritage protection. It detracts from otherwise extraordinary places. If you’re into archaeology, Tunisia is worth the trip. If you want great infrastructure, pristine cultural/historical/natural sites, and guaranteed English everywhere, maybe go elsewhere (but good luck finding that combination).



Below are my notes on archaeological sites. I ranked them rather arbitrarily from “must-see” to “only if you’re weirdly into this” (that is me).  

**Sufetula (modern Sbeitla):** absolute gem. Not the most famous or visited site. When I went here in late November, I had the place to myself (apart from the above-mentioned illicit coin hunters). You get a great view of Roman town planning and there are some very well-preserved temples. There is a little museum as well. It is one of those places where you can walk around for hours and constantly see new things.

Travel: I took a louage from Sousse to Sbeitla (15.5 dinar). It’s a long ride of about three hours, including a coffee/smoking break. The site is about a 20-minute walk from the louage station. Leave early as it might take a while for a louage to fill up (I arrived at the louage station around 06:00). Make sure to not leave too late (I left at 14:00).

**Dougga (near Téboursouk):** closer to Tunis and therefore attracts more tourists. It’s located on a hill and the town planning is much more chaotic since it follows the natural landscape. This makes it great to walk around as it is not always clear how to get to a particular building or viewpoint. I spent a lot of time at this place. Do not confine your visit to the key buildings. I walked towards the north, where there is a farmhouse still being used today (you’ll see farmers driving around on scooters on the old Roman roads). Even further north, you get a great view of the landscape and you will find even more ancient megaliths and various Roman tombstones dotted all over the area. Aim for the location of the Roman circus on Google Maps if you want to see those outlying features.

Travel: I took a louage from Tunis (Bab Saadoun) to Téboursouk (don’t remember the price, but less than 10 dinar?). From here you can get a taxi. I paid 20 dinar for a taxi to a place a bit further south of Dougga, where one of the more obscure archaeological sites is located (Agbia; you can skip this). I stayed in a hotel in Téboursouk (hotel Thugga; about €40 per night, which included breakfast and dinner).

**Chemtou/Simitthus (near Wadi Maliz):** definitely not a popular site. Nearby Bulla Regia seems to attract way more tourists. This is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that I spent half an hour at the local police station explaining why I was walking around Wadi Maliz (I was just hungry!) before visiting Chemtou. Chemtou is mostly known for its marble quarries, which supplied marble for many monuments in Rome. The landscape is simply stunning as are the huge quarries. There is even a camp where the forced labourers of the quarries were kept. You get a great view from the nearby hill. There is a nice theatre as well. The museum is very informative. It was co-designed by the German Archaeological Institute and in good German fashion it contains a lot of information. Again, I was the only visitor.

Travel: I spent a night at a horrible Airbnb in Jendouba (avoid this place, I’m not going to name-and-shame him, but he’s a ‘doctor’), and took a louage to Wadi Maliz. From here I took a taxi (10 dinar) to the site. On my way back to Wadi Maliz, I got a ride with the National Guard, who were already informed by the police about a weird tourist roaming around. You’re probably better off calling a taxi or walking to the main road hoping to find a taxi or louage to either Wadi Maliz or Jendouba.  

**Thysdrus (modern El Jem):** yes, touristy, but a must-see. The big amphitheatre is comparable to the Colosseum and equally impressive. Whereas the Colosseum is always busy, you will find fewer tourists here off-season. You can walk around fairly freely. Don’t skip the local archaeological museum (included in your ticket to the amphitheatre), which has amazing mosaics. There is in fact another amphitheatre at the town (an older one), which is left to rot. It’s near the louage station; just walk by it for the fun of it. There is also a big Roman circus in El Jem, which is now a dump. Best to skip that one.

Travel: I took a louage from Sousse (6.8 dinar). There is also a train running between the two towns. The big amphitheatre is a short walk from the louage station and the museum is even nearer.

**Carthago/Carthage**: I was a bit in doubt where to place Carthage. Yes, it is incredibly famous, but it didn’t deliver a huge “wow” for me. I ranked it high mainly because it’s a very easy visit from Tunis and because it deserves better than its current state. The site is in fact a collection of fairly isolated places scattered between the modern town, which makes it difficult to get a sense of the greatness of ancient Carthage. The Baths of Antoninus are worth a visit, and so are the amphitheatre, the tophet (an old burial place/sanctuary), and the area with Roman villas. The big cisterns were closed during my visit, but I hopped the fence. A very impressive construction!

Travel: theoretically, there is a train running from station Tunis Marine to Carthage, but the trains are currently not running. Instead, there is a crowded bus for 1 dinar that does the short ride.  

**Thuburbo Majus (near El Fahs)**: a fairly big archaeological site, which has a variety of buildings. It falls between the organised layout of Sbeitla and the more natural/chaotic structure of Dougga. There are (parts of) various gates to be seen as well as both domestic (small houses to bigger villas) and public architecture (bathhouses, temples). It is one of those places where you feel like you can ‘discover’ things, especially on a quiet day (again I was the only visitor). In the amphitheatre, you can see reused cippi (stone monuments with inscriptions) poking from the ground.

Travel: I took a very early train from Tunis to Pont du Fahs station (4.5 dinar if I recall correctly). A louage will be quicker (this costs a bit more, but not much). From El Fahs you can either get a taxi or walk for about an hour. I chose to walk and was stopped and inspected by the police (twice!). I took a louage back to Tunis.

**Uthina (near modern Farch Annabi)**: a quirky site not too far from Tunis that gave me mixed feelings. It boasts a massive temple and amphitheatre and various other buildings. The cisterns have been recently renovated (covered by very ugly modern concrete) and were closed during my visit (with a proper gate, unfortunately). The visiting centre is oddly large for its purpose (just ticket sales), but maybe they’ve got big plans. At Uthina I felt watched a lot.

You can walk through the fields for a short-cut if you deem it safe (I did so on the way back).

I stayed the night at Jendouba.

**Pheradi Majus (modern Sidi Khelifa)**: one of the sites that was unexpectedly closed. It’s halfway between Tunis and Sousse, yet I can’t imagine it attracting many visitors as it doesn’t compete well with the better-known sites at similar distance.

I’ll mostly remember Bekalta because I had to wait more than three hours for a train that should have run every hour.

Finally, don’t skip the Bardo Museum if you are in Tunis. It holds some very well-known artefacts from pre-Roman Carthage, many mosaics from the Roman period, and artefacts from the period following the Islamic conquest. In Sousse, the Archaeological Museum holds very impressive mosaics from Hadrumetum (now part of Sousse) and El Jem.",222,1765211168.0,travel,16,1.0,False

1phgryd,https://www.reddit.com/r/workingmoms/comments/1phgryd/i_hate_holiday_tipping_culture_on_a_public/,I hate holiday tipping culture on a public servant salary.  Screaming into the void,"I'm a public servant living in New York City, earning $120,000 a year.  Due to luck that I will not explain here, I can afford to buy a $2 million apartment in a 500-unit luxury building in the outer boroughs. However, I am house poor and living paycheck to paycheck on a public servant’s salary. I absolutely dread December for the past several years. The apartment building staff count is 23. For the past several years, I have given tips a little over $1,000 to 23 to 25 staff members. All this tipping was on a public servant salary when I made less than $120K, but I was childless, so I had more disposable income. While I love my residence and the building staff, I really wish someone explained to me HARD and drilled it in my head that it is customary to tip building staff in this local niche culture. This tipping adds up to close to $1,000 if not more. I’m afraid if I don’t tip, I would get side-eyed like if I get a leaky toilet. The resident manager takes 3 days to come instead of 1 hour. Idk. 🤷‍♂️ 
My building staff is unionized, which is great for them. Last year, they went on strike for a salary bump. Now comes daycare tipping. In addition to tipping the holiday staff, there are 2 main teachers, 1 assistant teacher, and 3 administrators to tip. The building staff and daycare staff are all wonderful people, but they haven't done anything beyond the minimum. I really feel like they are doing their job. I mean, isn't it their job to take the trash out, vacuum the carpet? For the daycare teachers, isn't their job to try to educate them, sing 1-2-3?Society as a whole has really gone haywire in expecting customers and clients to tip for everything. For example, I go out for a cup of coffee, and the cashier shows me a tablet. The menu of options is whether to tip 18% through 22%. WTF? I wanted to get that off my chest. If you read this far, thank you. ",31,1765211054.0,workingmoms,68,0.65,False
1phgrj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/askvan/comments/1phgrj7/great_time/,Great Time!,"My wife and I really enjoyed out vacation here in Downtown Vancouver. We both booked this trip 3 weeks ago on a whim to just get out and reset. I’m so happy we did too. We saw awesome round trip prices and always wanted to check out Canada. Also, we like to experience the weather locals go through regularly. We are from So Cal- Long Beach, CA

We stayed in such a great location on Seymour and Nelson and felt like it was convenient to walk everywhere we wanted! I just wanted to share my experience and appreciation!

First off- the weather really isn’t as bad as we expected, and we scored with a beautiful day Saturday the 6th with blue sky’s and sun! 

Things we did- Our first day we just walked around and got familiar with our surroundings. Checked out Robson square and ice rink. We loved walking around everywhere. The city seems planned out well and flows great. Unlike our area in So Cal.

Saturday was incredible- woke up to great weather, we went to Nemesis coffee and had incredible pastries and delicious coffee( the walk there we ran into some Fentanyl users folded over pissing on the street but not anything we having seen before being from LA. Although I will say, 4 days of being Downtown and I saw 1 cop car all trip haha. 

Anyways, continue on Saturday checked out Gastown and Steamclock which we loved! As well as the little shops done Water street. We then went and did the Seawall walk starting at Canada Place! This is such a special thing you guys have, we enjoyed every second of it. The sea planes were also really cool to watch. We road bikes half way and walked into Stanley Park and enjoyed a wonderful lunch and Stanley’s Bar and Grill. 

We ended the day at the Festival of Lights at Van Dusen botanical garden. It was really fun to walk around and see everything. Although we didn’t expect to run through it all so quickly, but that worked out because we watched Tis the Sitcom and the Improv Centre on Granville and we loved it so so much. Super funny, awesome seeing the locals interact and then talking about  Vancouver things like ( Vessi, white spot, cactus club) such a cool day/night 

Sunday- gloomy and raining again haha but not bad! We grabbed our coffee and walked down to Hornby Dock and took the Aquabus to Granville Island and explored the market and shops there, it was a unique experience with a lot of cool options. We headed back to Downtown and enjoyed some brunch before heading back to our place to relax before another big night.

We got ready and walked down to the Hyatt for our free shuttle to Capilano Suspension Brige Canyon Lights! This was INCREDIBLE. Everything was perfect. There was so much to do there, we spent a good 2 hrs there. Very well done. Highlight for sure! After Capilano we headed to Shipyards to see the night market. It had so much to offer but we were so hungry we didn’t want to wait in lines so we just ate at Tap&Barrel and it was solid. 

We fell in love with the city. People are nice, we love the diversity. It didn’t stink like LA or NYC it was clean. The prices seem to be fair. The gratuity culture was a little odd for us here. Although we tip regularly in LA. The servers don’t stand there while you select the tip amount, little uncomfortable but no biggie at all. 

Today (mon) we leave at 6 tonight. 

We are going to relax today and go check out Commercial Drive before heading back to YVR. 

Places we ate/coffee- Nero waffle bar, The Hard Bean, O sushi, The Greek, Nemesis, Pallet, No Bad Days 


10/10 would recommend Vancouver to others! We will be back someday!

 https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/s/miHS66qUay

Started my day at 730 taking 3 dulcolax.  They went to work about 1130.  Around noon I started dose 1, following the instructions from the mods. (Whole 16 oz water, tabs over 20 min with another 16 Oz, followed by a third 16 Oz. ).  Kicked in about an hour later, and multiple trips later i settled down about 4 or so.  I did have a cup of coffee and a cup of broth during the PM.  Plus I killed a medium bottle of Gatorade.  I was able to nod off for an hour or so but the purge urge woke me up about 6 ish.  Debated starting round 2 at 900 PM, but after discussion with my wife she convinced me to delay some.  I went to lay down about 900 and got up about 1130, not much sleep.  Started round 2 per the Dr. Instructions - 4 tabs with 16 Oz of water evey 30 min, followed by two more 16 oz glasses after.  on the toilet until about 345 and I settled a bit and took a short nap.  515 found me with the urge, and then I took a shower, followed by a final purge about 545.  Left at 6, arrived at 625 and checked in, and was wheeled in and put to sleep at 725 with protocol.  I was in the car headed home by 825.

Notwithstanding the recommendations to ""follow the doctors instructions"", I am glad I did not as I would never have made it to the outpatient center without a liquid purge in my wife's car.  Next time ill do the second starting at 900 all things equal so I can get some rest.  

See you in 7 years!",2,1765210968.0,colonoscopy,0,1.0,False
