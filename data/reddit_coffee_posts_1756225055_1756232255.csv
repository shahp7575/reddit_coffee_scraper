1n0t4ye,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1n0t4ye/can_baemin_acrylic_appliance_slider_revolutionize/,Can Baemin Acrylic Appliance Slider Revolutionize Kitchen Organization? Honest and Detailed Review,"The **Baemin B0DMSSB4L5 Acrylic Appliance Slider with Rubber Wheels** is an impressive kitchen gadget that I’ve had the opportunity to test extensively over the past weeks. As someone who loves an organized and efficient kitchen workspace, anything promising to prevent countertop chaos instantly grabs my attention. With this sliding tray, moving hefty kitchen appliances has become far less of a struggle, though there are certainly a few things that could use some polishing.

**Durable and Elegant Design**  
The moment I unboxed this product, I noticed its sleek and modern look. Made from high-quality acrylic and equipped with silent rubber wheels, this sliding tray feels sturdier than I expected. It blends seamlessly with my kitchen decor while maintaining functionality. The clear design not only looks minimalist but also doesn’t visually clutter the countertop, a big win for small kitchens. Weighing just 2.23 pounds and measuring 14 x 9.8 inches, it supports a wide range of appliances, even bulky stand mixers and air fryers, without compromising its structural integrity. The rubber wheels are a blessing—they glide smoothly without screeching or leaving scratches, even on my delicate marble countertop.

**Smooth Functionality**  
Functionality reigns supreme with this appliance slider. The tray makes it incredibly easy to pull my coffee maker or blender out from under cabinets, even when I’m half-asleep during my morning routine. One nifty detail is how quietly the wheels move. My toddler usually naps nearby during the day, so the silent operation of this tray was a lifesaver! It reduces countertop clutter, prevents steam damage under cabinets, and adds convenience to everyday cooking. There is also an ergonomic handle which not only improves grip but also provides better control when maneuvering heavier appliances. It doesn’t feel flimsy or prone to wear after regular use, which is a testament to its construction.

[Grab Baemin B0DMSSB4L5 at the best price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0dmssb4l5/)

**Versatility Across Devices**  
I’ve tested this sliding tray with everything from air fryers to rice cookers, and the results are consistently good. It handles width and height well, leaving enough space for even 3-quart instant pots or standard dual coffee makers. The 9.8 x 14-inch size suits most of my appliances perfectly, though some reviewers have mentioned larger dimensions might accommodate wider setups even better. Knowing that a slightly bigger size is offered added a bit of versatility for users with oversized gadgets. Honestly, it got me thinking I might need two of these!

**Key Benefits**  
- Smooth rubber wheels ensure silent, scratch-free maneuvering.  
- Durable acrylic construction looks stylish and resists wear.  
- Versatile size options make it perfect for various appliances.  
- Includes useful extras like a cable organizer.

**Areas of Concern**  
Despite its polished execution, a few minor flaws can’t be ignored.  
- The absence of locks on rubber wheels means heavier appliances can still drift a little.  
- Acrylic can micro-scratch over time and needs to be cleaned gently.  
- A slightly larger standard size could have been ideal for oversized devices.

**Challengers in the Market**  
When comparing this sliding tray to other popular options like the KitchenCraft Glider Tray or the DecoSpace Appliance Mover, the Baemin B0DMSSB4L5 holds its own well. While some of its competitors focus on heavier-duty materials like stainless steel, they often compromise design aesthetics. Baemin strikes a balance between elegance and utility. However, its competitors occasionally offer stronger locking mechanisms for enhanced stability, which this tray lacks.

**Affordable Quality**  
While it’s hard to estimate the price’s exact fluctuations, I feel the features justify the investment. Products designed to make life easier (especially in the kitchen) often come at a cost, and this one pitches itself as both functional and stylish. The inclusion of a 24-hour customer service option and detailed care instructions sweetens the deal, especially when buying online where reliability can sometimes feel like a gamble.

> “He (John Cena) absolutely refused to do it (put over). I was told that was what happened. Because the original plan was I was gonna defeat him on WWE RAW and then I do the tease. But I’m a young guy. I have been there for a cup of coffee, so what are you gonna do?”



Swagger added that Cena had a history of keeping the spotlight for himself:

> “I’m not the only guy he has done that to, he did that throughout his career. I was surprised to see what happened with him and R-Truth lately, because usually he tried to take that glory. But I feel like this time, he’s the one who said we better go with Truth and get him back here.”

I’m 20, been living in Boston for almost 2 years. Most of my jobs have been as a barista in coffee shops, but honestly I feel like I need something different. I’ve got a baby on the way, and I really want a job where I can build a future for my family.

Construction looks really good to me — building roads, bridges, buildings, all that. I know it’s tough work, but I’m willing to put in the effort. The thing is, I have no idea where to start.
	•	Do I just apply for laborer jobs, or do I need to get into a union first?
	•	Are there any apprenticeships or training programs in Boston that would take someone like me with no experience?
	•	What would you recommend as the very first step?

We started off close, drifted for a bit, and then reconnected in high school/college and became really close again: we go on trips, exchange gifts, talk all the time, the usual.

But honestly, I’m at my breaking point with her. Back when I had my first boyfriend (her best friend at the time), he lied to me about his name, age, and other stuff. She knew the whole time and said nothing. After we broke up, she admitted it and then went on to date him for four years. I was young and brushed it off, but looking back now, that was a huge red flag.

And it hasn’t gotten better. Whenever I open up about something serious like the breakup from my three year relationship and how I’ve been learning to love myself, she says things like, “I didn’t know you were in love,” or makes jokes that make my feelings seem like a joke. If I give her advice, she’ll tell me I don’t know what I’m talking about, but when she has problems, I always try to be supportive.

In our group of five friends, she constantly talks over me, answers questions directed at me, or laughs off my advice and replaces it with her own. Even with small stuff, she always has to “one up” me, like recommending a place for coffee and then insisting her pick is better with a full argument why. It’s exhausting.

I’ve realized I feel disrespected, dismissed, and honestly… like my voice doesn’t matter when she’s around. I’m tired of trying to be a good friend to someone who makes me feel small.

1n0sybi,https://www.reddit.com/r/EndTipping/comments/1n0sybi/are_we_just_nostalgic_or_has_service_really_gone/,"Are we just nostalgic, or has service really gone downhill - from an older millennial","Hello fellow tip skeptics,

I've been thinking about this for a while and recently founds this subreddit so found dropping a rant cathartic. I used to tip 20 percent or more no matter what. As I have gotten older, I have started questioning why. Outside of very nice restaurants where you expect a high level of service, the quality has dropped off.

We went to Texas Roadhouse recently. It's a great spot if you have kids. So, now you order on a screen and the server basically just drops off a drink (no refill guaranteed) and then your food. That is it. Yet when the bill comes, they are asking for 18 to 25 percent. Come to think of it, they don't even bring a bill, it's all on the apparatus on the table you order from.  

Anyway, as an older millennial (40), I remember going out with my parents at places like Chilis or Olive Garden and the servers were attentive, friendly, constantly checking in. Sometimes you wondered why they came by so much, but the service was always on point. 

Or is that just nostalgia talking? Because now it feels like a lot of servers act entitled, do not want to do much work, and carry a bad attitude. I understand the job and the pay may suck, but that is exactly why I do not do it. If you hate it that much, maybe try something else.

What really shifted my perspective was learning that in California servers make fifteen to sixteen dollars an hour as minimum wage, and they still ask for tips on top of that. I had just gone out to dinner and tipped twenty percent, but later thought that had I known I would not have tipped at all. From that point on my tips became smaller or non existent and my hatred for tipping culture has only grow stronger.

Now it feels like every interaction wants a tip. Coffee counter. Tip screen. Takeout bag handoff. Tip request. Why am I tipping someone who just took my payment and handed me a bag. Those are the least skillful parts of the process.

So I am curious what this community thinks:

Do you tip zero everywhere no matter what, or do you have a baseline and adjust based on the situation? If so, what is your baseline?

Are there any situations like kiosks, coffee counters, or takeout bag pickups where you still tip even though the “service” is basically handing you your order?

Has anyone ever confronted you for not tipping?",9,1756231038.0,EndTipping,6,1.0,False

It calms me, it makes me cry sometimes and I don’t know why. I prefer being surrounded by the woods. Since I was a child I always had this one flash back of an empty field and a well, the grass was dry and tall, it was hot out. I walk through the field, hearing the bugs and birds around me, I hear the grass crunching below my feet. 

I once stepped into one of the historic cabins in Tennessee and the smell of it made me cry. I literally had to force my body out of it. 

I had this dream that woke me up when it ended and I needed to write everything down so I didn’t lose it. 
It was almost spring, I was at a market of some sorts outside. The grass was yellow, it was cold out and though I don’t mentally know if it was actually spring, I just knew it? I wore a long dress, my sister did, too. She has blonde hair and blue eyes just like all of my brother did. There was a lot of them. My brothers liked to cause trouble, and they were known for protecting me against boys who liked me. I remember watching them sitting in a barn loft teasing each other before hopping down to me. I don’t know about my mother, but I knew my father was in jail and he was getting out soon.

There was horses and carriages. Fast forward to summer time, we find my dad while he’s at a fair. He was tan, with dark blue eyes black wavy hair and shiny from sweat. He told us we were going to have to move and I was really upset (though I don’t know why.) the next thing I remember is being in a wagon and looking at an approaching sign saying welcome to “Dahnmar”. This is exactly how it’s spelled, this town doesn’t exist anywhere. I’ve searched relentlessly. The only place I found this name was in North Carolina, it’s a family farm with that last name, however, the family that owns it now doesn’t have that last name. 

I’m going insane trying to find this place. 

I then come to find out that my mother is adopted. My mother was the last child of 14. They lived deep in Kentucky. Her mother was married to a man, and my mothers sister (my mothers aunt) was also married to him. They all have blonde hair and blue eyes. My mother was taken away by cps and put up for adoption in Indiana, (I can’t remember why she was in Indiana). My mother’s bio father died by accidently catching himself on fire while making coffee. Bio mom died from cancer. Not sure on aunt. My mother got into contact with one of her sisters but she wasn’t very helpful. I come to find out my mother’s family hail from Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, basically all of Appalachia, and we are directly related to the Hatfeilds. 

It’s driving me crazy wondering if I’m seeing a past life, or I’m seeing a dead relatives life, or I AM a passed relative of myself. It’s all very confusing and I don’t know how to get more answers. I feel lost and I am continuously longing for something and I don’t know what. What do I do? How do I connect these dots and get answers? ",2,1756231023.0,pastlives,0,1.0,False

But last fall, as I juggled life in Portland—managing my start-up, evening jogs, and a social life—I noticed something off. My energy dipped mid-morning, and by 3 p.m., I’d be eyeing the snack drawer like I was starving. I’d quit carbs, tried weird routines, but nothing lasted.

That’s when a coworker casually mentioned how she blends a metabolism-boosting powder into her coffee every morning. Curiosity got me, so I looked into it and decided to try Java Burn. Not flashy, just a sachet in my mug.

For the first week, nothing dramatic—same coffee, same me. But by week two, I realized I wasn’t raiding the snack stash. By week three, those mid-afternoon crashes? Gone. I stayed alert through back-to-back meetings, and worst of all—I didn’t crave the usual energy bar.

It wasn’t magic—it was subtle. But talking to my friend the other day, she asked how I’ve been so energized and focused lately. I smiled, no longer reaching for that sugary fix. My routine swapped cravings for clarity, and my coffee felt like more than just a wake-up—it felt like a smart start.",1,1756231005.0,TriedAndRated,0,1.0,False

1n0swsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1n0swsg/the_stillness_at_sable_crossing/,The Stillness at Sable Crossing,"Elias worked the night shift at the railway outpost near Sable Crossing, a place most people in town had long since forgotten existed. The tracks there hadn't seen a train in over twenty years, yet the railway company insisted on keeping someone on watch, just in case. The little wooden station was more of a shed than an office; one lamp, a desk, a shortwave radio, and a wall of dusty logbooks where every guard before him had written down their observations. 

It was mind-numbingly dull work. Elias would sit, scribble the weather in the log, sip bitter coffee, and listen to the groaning of the forest around him. The woods pressed in close on both sides of the tracks, thick with pine trees that swallowed the moonlight whole. Some nights, the silence was so complete he swore he could hear his own blood moving. 

Around midnight, it came again - the sound he had been hearing for weeks. 

At first, he thought it was the wind. A faint hum rising and falling, almost like voices carried from a distance. But the trees were still, and no breeze touched his skin. The sound lingered too long, like dozen of throats murmuring in unison, speaking a language he didn't know, but somehow almost understood. He would write in the log, ""indistinct voices heard along tracks, duration: four minutes."" Always around midnight. Always ending as suddenly as it began. 

He had asked his supervisor once. The man's response was too quick, too flat: ""Write it down and ignore it. Don't go looking.""

But Elias was not the type to ignore things.

That night, when the voices swelled again, he did something none of the logbooks mentioned; he left the shed. The air outside was heavy, pressing on his ears. The hum thickened into something almost melodic, guiding him down the rails. He followed, each step ringing on the iron like a clock ticking away. 

The forest leaned darker the farther he went, as though the lamps of the station behind him had been snuffed out. Then he saw it.

A light ahead. 

Not the harsh beam of a lantern or flashlight. No, this was dim, pale, and wavering, like moonlight caught under water. As he approached, it revealed the outline of a train car sitting in the middle of the tracks. Its surface was wrong - metal that seemed too smooth, seamless, as if it had grown there rather then been built. The windows were black mirrors.

And inside, shadows moved.

They weren't passengers. Not really. They were shapes in human form, mouths working silently in the rhythm of the hum that had pulled him here. As Elias stood frozen, every head inside turned toward him at once. Their mouths moved wider, faster, until the hum broke into words he could finally understand. 

**""We've been waiting.""**

The doors slid open without a sound.

The logbooks had been wrong. It wasn't about ignoring the voices, it was about resisting the invitation.

And Elias, trembling on the edge of the open car, realized too late that every guard before him had succeeded.

1n0swpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HollandAmerica/comments/1n0swpw/apex_norway_celebrity_vs_hal_comparo/,Apex Norway -- Celebrity vs. HAL Comparo,"We just returned from a 14-night Norway sailing on the Celebrity Apex. This was our first Celebrity sailing. We have sailed on HAL quite a bit, but also on Carnival, NCL, WindStar, Costa, and Royal. We have never had a bad cruise. We do not cruise exclusively but love cruise itineraries with a lot of scenery right from the ship, and this cruise was ideal. Rather than write a regular review, I’m going to focus on the differences we experienced between Celebrity and HAL, since HAL is our line of choice. I admit I am a biased reviewer. We are in our early 60’s.

Before I get to the specifics, I should mention that we most likely will not sail Celebrity again. The drinks on this cruise were simply far too expensive. We drink beer, specifically IPA, and we do not drink enough to justify a drink package. I drink 1-2 beers a day. On Celebrity, a Stone IPA is $16. On HAL, that same beer is $9.15. At HAL’s happy hour, which we try to always utilize, the same beer is $4.57. So for our specific case, we are paying almost 4x as much for the exact same beer on Celebrity. While we can afford to pay that much, Celebrity, by asking for that much, is really breaking an unwritten code that the cruise lines will not take advantage of their captive audience. We don’t like that kind of treatment. I know this topic has been covered exhaustively and is not likely to change.

I did buy several $16 beers over the course of the cruise and three times they were tallied as $18 on the receipt. I suggest you check your bills. No apologies when this was pointed out.

**Food**

We ate in the dining room(s) about half the days and we found the dining room food to be excellent. HAL’s dining room food is pretty good, but Celebrity’s was noticeably better in most cases. The food seemed less processed and better prepared on Celebrity, and we loved being able to get a side of vegetables. HAL has much better bread though, not just in the dining room but all over the ship.

For the Lido, it was about the same. Celebrity’s food is just a bit better than HAL. They had a very wide array of selections and everything was pretty good. Celebrity puts dairy alternatives like oatmilk and soy milk out on the counter where guests can access them, while HAL makes guests stand in a long line. Same thing with berries, HAL keeps those — and only those — behind the counter, while Celebrity puts them out. I do suspect though that Celebrity is not using fresh strawberries, as the berries taste way too sweet, like they are in sugar syrup. HAL’s are fresh, which is much better from a health perspective obviously.

For Lido / free coffee, Celebrity wins again. HAL’s free coffee is just OK and can be watery, but Celebrity’s was very good.

For burgers and pizza at the specialty counters, HAL crushes Celebrity. HAL’s pizza is very good and is cooked to order, while Celebrity’s is served high school cafeteria style. Celebrity was good about keeping slices out though and for a very fast pick-up, the pizza was ok. As for the burgers, we only went to the burger counter (Mast Grill) once. It used a very confusing system of ordering/waiting/toppings, unlike HAL’s extremely orderly system of in-app and at-the-counter ordering. Although Celebrity has multiple options for burgers (same as HAL), requesting anything other than a standard patty yields a loud “FIFTEEN MINUTES” response from the cook. It seems like they don’t want to deal with these and in fact they undercooked ours badly. The burgers on HAL are fantastic and the logistics are flawless, so it’s hard to see how another line could fail so badly.

**Rooms**

We had a partially obscured balcony — one of those “circle windows” — and our friends were upgraded to an infinite veranda. Both of these rooms were great and we preferred them over the HAL approach. I don’t know why it took so long for cruise lines to figure this out, but many guests want to leave their windows open all day and maybe all night. Especially during scenic cruising, it is so nice to bring in the fresh air and sounds. It’s OK if the AC gets disabled, on many days the weather outside is more than fine. Anyway we would sail with either of these room designs again. HAL’s balconies use a heavy swing-closed door that is really only intended to be opened briefly to go in or out.

**Hand Washing**

Celebrity has amazing hand-wash stations at the entrances to the Lido. HAL has these also, but Celebrity has a much larger number of taps. We wash our hands on entering the Lido and we usually wash after each trip to the food area. Celebrity has way more touchable service items than HAL — which I do not like — so it is even more important to wash often. Unfortunately, Celebrity guests seem to be as unwilling to wash their hands as HAL guests. I would estimate compliance at the hand wash stations to be about 30% at most. Some did use the sanitizer instead, but sanitizer is not effective against Norovirus. Personally I would like to see the lines force guests to comply but I know that will not happen. I saw an older idiot actually walk over to the wash stations, grab a paper towel and cough into it, and then walk directly into the Lido without washing. He was right there!

By the way, we found a stern hand wash station just outside the pizza area on the starboard side. It’s very hard to notice but is great if you are sitting near the back on the Lido.

**Magic Carpet**

I am assuming that this thing really is most useful during tendering. We did not have any tender ports, so maybe we did not really see it in full action. For what we did see though, it seems pointless. It makes the ship ugly from a classical sense, and while it adds some seating, it’s just not that compelling. Also, most oddly, it does not move while people are on it! I thought that was the whole point. I mean, has Celebrity ever seen Aladdin? The Magic Carpet is a means of transport, not a room extension. Anyway as a Celebrity casual observer, the Carpet was a fail where the Infinite Veranda was a huge win.

**The Ship**

Just a couple of comments on the ship. Celebrity’s allegiance to revenue creation is very evident. There are no forward-viewing areas on the ship other than the gym. No Crows Nest looking forward, no bow area, and no windows really that face forward. They sacrificed all of that area to the spa and a few large suites. They did open the bow one day on this cruise, someone told me the cost was $165 but I don’t know for sure. For itineraries like this, it is very nice to be able to see forward and on HAL, on scenic cruising days the bow is open (free like it should be) and jumping, and the Crow’s Nest area is very popular.

Celebrity has also made a massive amount of very open seating into so-called cabanas, code for “pay to sit” of course. This seems silly to me, these seats are in a very public space near the pool and have constant foot traffic, but maybe that is what people like in the Caribbean. To me it seems like another indication that Celebrity and its guests are in a largely adversarial relationship.

**Music**

Again, HAL crushes Celebrity in this category. It is not even close. HAL has a full deck dedicated to music, and anytime after dinner you can find multiple options for live music going on. HAL has got the timing down to a science, where a great rock band will start playing one minute after the house R&B band wraps up just 100’ down the corridor. It is almost like a music festival in that you can move from stage to stage and see as much music as you want. HAL generally has the two bands mentioned, plus a jazz combo for before dinner music and a classic trio on longer sailings, plus a dueling piano bar. These are all staffed with great musicians and an excellent technical team.

On Celebrity, it was very different. We could barely find any live music, and when we did it was not very good. The band in the atrium area was so quiet that we could hear the tap-tap-tap of the eDrum louder than the actual drum sound from the PA. We saw both bands plus the acoustic soloist and duo. They were all OK but only the soloist Matthew was really good. It just seemed like music was a complete afterthought on Celebrity, while on HAL it is a primary design element of the ship.

We saw two shows in Eden, which were too crowded and featured guests moving around very heavy seats. We also saw several shows in the main theater, these were fine and very comparable to HAL. By the way, drinks in Eden are $26.

**Summary**

We really enjoyed this cruise. While Celebrity is perhaps not ideal for us I know there are a lot of people that are big fans. It’s great that we have so many options to choose from.",4,1756230940.0,HollandAmerica,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Bournemouth vs. Brentford EFL Cup Showdown: Cherries, Clean Sheets, and Midnight Snacks**

The 2025-26 EFL Cup’s second round throws a curveball at 12:15 AM IST (yes, a time when most of us are debating whether to microwave leftovers or cry into a pillow). Bournemouth, the “Cherries,” host Brentford, the “Bees,” in a clash that’s equal parts intriguing and oddly scheduled. Let’s unpack this like a post-match press conference where everyone’s had three cups of coffee.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Bookies’ Favorite?

The numbers scream **Bournemouth as the clear favorite**, with decimal odds hovering around **1.83-1.87** (implying a **53-57% implied probability** of victory). Brentford, meanwhile, sits at **3.5-4.1 odds** (a **24-29% chance**), while the draw is a toss-up at **3.65-4.1** (roughly **24-28%**). Translating this to English: bookmakers think Bournemouth is twice as likely to win as Brentford, and a draw’s about as probable as a Premier League team fielding a squad of kangaroos.

Brentford’s recent 1-0 win over Aston Villa (keeping a clean sheet) is their golden ticket, but Bournemouth’s home form—despite a shaky 4-2 opener against Liverpool—gives them an edge. The Cherries’ defense, however, might as well be a sieve with a personality disorder. That 4-2 loss to Liverpool? Imagine a goalkeeper playing Jenga with the opposition’s shots.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Managers, and Moral Fiber

Bournemouth’s **Antoine Semenyo** headlines the emotional stakes. After enduring racial abuse in a prior match, he’s vowed to “remember how the entire football family stood together.” Let’s be real: Bournemouth’s defense might be leaky, but their resolve? Steel. Semenyo’s story isn’t just inspiring—it’s a rallying cry. This team isn’t just playing for three points;

I spent the past two months building a print publication for Birmingham called Magic City Reader. The first issue dropped on Friday. You can get it at these places:

* TrimTab
* Hero
* Cahaba
* Cala Coffee
* June Coffee
* Forstall Art Center
* Pizitz bar
* Sidewalk Cinema upstairs
* Sanctum
* Frothy
* Good People

It has local news, features, a big arts calendar, a comic drawn by a local artist, and lots more. For the first issue, I looked into the mayor's race.

I grew up in Hoover but have lived downtown for some years. As a kid, I was fascinated by Black&White. I went on to a career in newspapers and developed the right skill sets to do this. I love print media, no one in sight was picking up the banner, so I decided I would.

The first issue was wholly produced with a staff of two (me and a photographer). The website is [mcr.pub](http://mcr.pub), but 95% of the content is in the print copies. There are so many things I'd like to do as we grow. Everything will evolve over time.

If you know of a business that would advertise, pass this along.

I did a gut rehab on a great house in a neighborhood in north city. I love many, many things about my neighborhood, but now that I have young kids, the drug and gang scene is really getting to me. Namely, the empty lots around my property are a popular meetup for drug deals, there was a homicide on our block recently, and we regularly find bullet casings outside our house. Thankfully we have not been the victims of anything. 

Our kids are in great schools, so ironically, we find ourselves wanting to stay in the city for the schools. I know Maplewood is amazing, but suburbs are not something we're considering right now. 

Most important is finding a neighborhood with old homes that our kids can be safe in. I'd love to be able to let my kids play outside without the threat of junkies, armed gang members, or stray pit bulls making their way into my yard (all of which have happened). 

Young families, neighborhood block parties, trick or treating on Halloween, walkability to parks/playgrounds or coffee shops would all be ideal. 

Due to my commute, I need to have pretty easy access to 64-40. I'm not super interested in going south/east of Gravois, but could be open if there's something I'm missing.

Let's pretend that money is no object. What neighborhoods would you recommend? I know what of a lot of these neighborhoods are like as a visitor for shops, dining, parks, etc, but what is it like to really live there?

Hello everyone!!

It’s been hell of a week 🤣 the first couple of days I didn’t feel hungry AT ALL. I really struggled with food. Nonetheless, after 5 days, my hunger came back and I could eat normally. I went to the gym only 3 times tho 🥲 I decided to take time to adjust based on how I felt. This week, I hope I’ll be able to go 5 times.

Some regular meals were a BIG NO (chicken, pork, etc.). I’ve always hated fish and now I’m craving it 😂 I ordered a protein powder on amazon and I’ll have that with coffee everyday. I’ll force myself to eat my protein, I need to retain as much muscle as possible (I spent 5 years building it, I’m around 70lbs of muscle rn).

Also, I was ovulating this week. I always gain around 3-5 pounds, but this time I actually lost one pound!!!! 😭 I’m so happy.

I know it’s relatively early in this process and I’m already experiencing this side effect. Could you give me some advice on how to keep nausea/feeling extremely full at a minimum?

I still have a couple of hours to go till I break my fast, and I am still feeling great. 

The once monstrous cravings are now friendly.

The reason I posted early today is to ""share tips, maybe motivate someone,"" and also give a chance to **those who have already broken their fasts to share their day 17 progress.**

To start with, I'd love to discourage those of us who obsess about weight change.

Do not do that; instead, obsess about habits. 

**The only reason I, and you should too, use the tracker daily, is for consistency and accountability.**

It's also the only way you'll detect inconsistencies and destructive patterns.

As for weight, it might not budge today, or tomorrow, but it definitely will **if you do things right.**

So, make sure you get everything else right.

Proper meals only during your **dedicated eating windows.** 

Well-balanced macros and appropriately **portioned to support weight loss.** 

**Count your calories if you can**, or get a structured meal plan with calorie estimates. 

Make sure you are aware of your TDEE and are **always in deficit.**

I also can't overemphasize how **exercise has been important to me,** and I encourage you to get active too if you want to melt that stubborn fat you hate so much.

**You don't have to do acrobatics**, just what you can. 

Focus on mild strength training and walking a few steps daily. Controlled cardio to avoid spiking cortisol, it is not so friendly to weight loss.

Then, **at least for the 28 days** of the challenge, **force yourself to be disciplined**. 

Don't look for loopholes to consume **unnecessary junk during your fasting window** just because ""it is below 50 calories"", or because you are not ""a fasting purist"". It's a challenge for a reason.

For your fasting window: water, black coffee, electrolytes (no cals & unflavored), at least for these 28 days only.

It's what has worked for me. 

**Lastly make sure you follow the daily progress threads to let us know how it's going.**

It's possible to lose weight.

**So if you are in, share progress; if you want in, just comment ""I'm in"" and I'll follow up.**",1,1756230456.0,intermittentfasting,0,0.6,False

This countertop unit promises chewable, crunchy nugget ice with simplicity and efficiency, and I was eager to see if it lived up to the hype. Over the past few weeks, it became a regular part of my kitchen routine, and I tested every single feature to the fullest extent to share my real experience with it.

**Design and Portability**

Right out of the box, I was struck by how sleek and compact this ice maker is. Its stainless steel silver finish adds a modern touch to the kitchen, and its footprint—measuring 11.3 x 8.66 x 12.68 inches—takes up very little countertop space. Despite its solid, 20-pound build, it is surprisingly portable. I easily moved it from the kitchen to the backyard for a weekend barbecue. The transparent casing is another great design decision. I liked being able to quickly glance at the ice levels without opening the machine or stopping its operation. It even comes with a handy ice scoop that tucks neatly into small spaces.

**Performance and Rapid Ice Production**

Efficiency is one thing this nugget ice maker doesn’t skimp on. It boasts the ability to produce its first batch of ice in about seven minutes. I timed it, and honestly, the claim holds water. Within a quarter of an hour of pressing the power button, I had enough chewable nuggets for a couple of drinks. Its ability to produce up to 35 pounds of ice in a 24-hour cycle feels like overkill for personal use, but I imagine this feature would be a lifesaver if you’re hosting a large gathering or running a small office. Having tested it during game nights and even a family potluck, I never ran out of fresh, nugget-style ice.

**Ease of Use**

This countertop machine couldn’t be simpler. With just one button to activate, it’s as user-friendly as it gets. Even my tech-shy mother-in-law found it intuitive to use. The self-cleaning function was an absolute lifesaver for me. All you have to do is press and hold the ON/OFF button for five seconds, and it cleans itself in about 15 minutes. It gave me peace of mind knowing the ice was always fresh and pristine. Trust me, having experienced the messy nightmare of cleaning older ice machines manually, this feature alone feels like a gift.

**Highlights**

- Sleek and compact design suitable for any kitchen or event
- Produces its first ice batch in seven minutes
- Capable of making up to 35 pounds of chewable nugget ice in 24 hours
- Transparent casing for ice level monitoring
- Self-cleaning feature for low-maintenance use
- Included scoop for hassle-free serving

**Noise and Whisper-Quiet Operation**

Noise is often a deal-breaker with appliances, but I was pleasantly surprised by how quiet this unit is. Tested in a noise-controlled setting, it produces just 43 dB of sound when operating—quieter than my dishwasher, for sure. That said, after about a week, I began noticing it sounded a tad louder. A quick run of the self-cleaning cycle with white vinegar resolved the issue, as hard water buildup had started affecting its operation. It’s something to consider if you live in an area with hard water, although maintenance is straightforward.

**Chewable Nugget Ice: Perfect for Drinks**

The nugget ice came out exactly as promised: crunchy, chewable, and the perfect texture for my sodas and cocktails. Whether you’re looking to enhance an iced coffee or get the right kind of slushie consistency, the compacted, layered flakes melt slower than regular ice and don’t dilute the flavor of drinks as quickly. My kids became obsessed with this feature. After a week, they were begging for ""nugget ice slushies"" every day after school. It works equally well for party cocktails, and my favorite use was for whiskey on the rocks—it kept the drink cold while maintaining its integrity.

**Drawbacks**

Not everything was perfect, though there weren’t major disappointments. 

- Lacks a built-in freezer, so melted ice turns back into water over time
- Requires regular cleaning if your area has hard water
- Limited capacity for large-scale commercial use  

**Competing Products**

Compared to other pebble or nugget ice makers in a similar price range, this machine holds its own well. I looked into offerings from GE Profile, FirstBuild Opal, and a few other brands. Some rival models like the Opal produce slightly higher quantities of ice and integrate app-controlled features, but they come at a significant price hike. What I found particularly refreshing about this Crzoe model was its straightforward, no-nonsense approach—it keeps things simple while delivering what matters most: great chewable ice. If you don't need app connectivity or extra tech features, this one is a strong contender.

**Financial Value**

Looking at its combination of features, the efficiency, and overall performance, I found this nugget ice maker to be a fantastic bang for the buck. It feels like a well-rounded pick for anyone who loves entertaining guests or simply enjoys high-quality nugget ice at their fingertips. While it lacks some advanced features that I've seen in higher-end models, it hits that sweet spot between cost and functionality. For the quality it delivers, this feels like a cost-effective solution that’s built to impress.

This countertop unit promises chewable, crunchy nugget ice with simplicity and efficiency, and I was eager to see if it lived up to the hype. Over the past few weeks, it became a regular part of my kitchen routine, and I tested every single feature to the fullest extent to share my real experience with it.

**Design and Portability**

Right out of the box, I was struck by how sleek and compact this ice maker is. Its stainless steel silver finish adds a modern touch to the kitchen, and its footprint—measuring 11.3 x 8.66 x 12.68 inches—takes up very little countertop space. Despite its solid, 20-pound build, it is surprisingly portable. I easily moved it from the kitchen to the backyard for a weekend barbecue. The transparent casing is another great design decision. I liked being able to quickly glance at the ice levels without opening the machine or stopping its operation. It even comes with a handy ice scoop that tucks neatly into small spaces.

1n0smzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/thessaloniki/comments/1n0smzu/exploring_the_lesser_known_sides_of_the_city/,Exploring the lesser known sides of the city,"Hi everyone, 

I'm posting here, because I am currently in Thessaloniki for 3 weeks for language classes. Currently – and differently from classes I took in other countries –, there's no one really in my class, so l'm on my own.\* Since I'll be here for quite some time, I have two questions :) 

1. I’ve read up on the Museums and historical monuments of the city which I will definitely be exploring since I’m very interested in history anyway (I’m working at a German university in a historic discipline). However, since I have enough time here, I’d be very curios about some of the lesser „touristy“ sides of the city, like cute book stores (or any cute stores, really), unique coffee places or interesting shopping possibilities. I’d love to take home a Greek volume of Asterix & Obelix (I try to collect them in as many languages as possible and already have 2 volumes in Ancient Greek, but none in modern Greek), maybe someone has an idea where I could find that? Also, all of what I’ve seen in 2 days is more or less located around Ladadika, which I understand to be kind of the center, i.e. culturally, if not geographically (at least the Plateia Aristotelous is called the „heart of the city“ and similar on some web pages) and which I’ve walked extensively already. I have also walked through the Ano Poli. I have no idea, however, which other neighborhoods are particularly worth seeing. 
2. I don’t mind having a beer all by myself and being with my own thoughts every now and then, especially since I’m not the clubbing kind of person. However, 2 weeks+  can be a long time without a companion. Maybe there’s someone out there who is in the city on his own, too; or who for whatever reason would like to meet up for exploring or for a drink in the evening. A language tandem / exchange might also be cool, in case there’s anyone learning German.\*\* 

I hope you don’t mind me asking all this – most things that I read just give advice like „go to Ladadika“ „go to Plateia Aristotelous“ and similar. I’m just really interested in the perspective of locals :)

Hope you have a beautiful day everyone! :)

\*I knew this before, it's partly due to the season, but I couldn't arrange it otherwise. Also, people who learn greek in language schools here seem to be in their 50s and older rather than in their 20s / 30s, so I’m not expecting much.

\*\*I understand (written) Greek pretty well due to passive vocabulary knowledge and because I studied ancient Greek. But I still have a hard time speaking…

Já podemos falar dos melhores cafés do ano?

Uma das melhores surpresas que tive em 2025 foi o **Catuaí Vermelho da Fazenda Guariroba**, torrado pelo Mantí Café (SP). Merecidamente, esse grão ficou em 2o lugar no Coffee of the Year Brasil 2024. 

O aroma é coisa de outro mundo. Basta abrir o pacote para ser bombardeado por notas de manga, framboesa e maracujá. Surreal!

Apanhei para acertar a receita, pois a fermentação anaeróbica de 36h aparece na xícara na forma de um amargor desagradável (talvez por conta do meu moedor). Bastou baixar a temperatura para 87oC que essa nota de fermentação foi domada - resultando num café doce, cítrico e equilibrado.

Obrigado pelos baristas do Mantí Café (SP) pela indicação desse grão. Levei um pacote pra casa e fui muito feliz (enquanto durou). Quero comprar novamente, antes que essa jóia vire história!

Fica também meu destaque para o **Mantí Café**, que ganhou meu coração com esse café incrível e com o melhor atendimento que já tive em uma cafeteria! Os baristas são muito atenciosos, entendem muito e buscaram entender meu gosto pessoal antes de recomendar os cafés. A Letícia (dona do Mantí) é uma das pessoas mais interessantes que já conheci nesse meio - anotem o nome dela! Tenho certeza que ela e o Mantí vão se destacar MUITO nos próximos anos.

I know some companies might offer a higher starting pay, but I chose this one because of the learning experience and exit opportunities especially if I plan to work abroad someday.

My only concern is the cost of living in Makati. Let’s say condo-sharing/bed space rent would be around 3k–5k per month plus other expenses. Though, hindi naman po ako magastos, I don’t go to coffee shops often, rarely shop online, and I can say matipid naman ako. The setup is hybrid din, so may times na mas lamang yung WFH.

Also, my parents don’t require me to give monthly support yet since they understand na I’m just starting out in my career. Pero syempre, gusto ko pa rin silang ma-treat paminsan and myself occasionally if kaya. Sila rin mismo nagsabi na sarili ko lang naman ang bubuhayin ko.

For those who also started their careers living/working in Makati, paano niyo po nabudget yung 20k (or similar) salary? Can you share your usual expenses and kung magkano po natitira sa inyo at the end of the month? Can you also share if san po kayo nag-rent?

Roadside shoulder on a warm afternoon. Camera is from dash-cam inside the cruiser, angled through the windshield. In the background, a slightly beat-up sedan is parked on the side of the road with its hood popped. A wildlife officer can be seen holding a small animal crate near it.  

5. Characters and Detailed Actions  
- Officer Dan sits calmly in the driver’s seat, wearing aviators and sipping gas-station coffee.  
- A wildlife officer in an orange vest is crouched near the open engine bay of the other car, coaxing something out.  
- Faint squeaks and the rustling of leaves can be heard.  
- A large possum suddenly darts out of the engine bay and runs across the hood of the cruiser. Officer Dan doesn’t flinch.

When I looked for the post with my comment under it, it was deleted, and where it was pinned before was replaced with a different video.","I was scrolling last night through Reels, and I watched this video with a comparison of before and after, with the caption ""You're too far gone from Christ"" showing them in heavy dark makeup and Gothic type attire and vaping, and then the after saying ""If I would have believed that, I would have never come back"" with her now in dresses in a more modest, elegant aesthetic, no more heavy makeup, and smiling wide.

It almost had me in the first half, I thought I was seeing a before and after Christian video, but in the after collage, there was a picture of her smiling and posing by the Temple.


That just ruined the video for me once I saw that.
Upon looking more into the account, it seems to be all about returning to Mormonism. The whole schtick is I was led astray but came back to the ""one true church.""

This was my comment:

""The ""restored"" church implies the true one was broken. I've been LDS, I've read the Book of Mormon, which claims it's another testament of Jesus Christ (aka blasphemy). 

The Bible itself warns against those who add or detract from Bible. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is one of them, by claiming it's ""The Bible 2."" 

When you walk into an LDS church, you don't see one cross. There is something wrong with that.
Their followers don't wear crosses. They wear CTR, temple necklaces, anything but a true Christian sign.

They claim to be about Jesus, but their practices have nothing to do with Jesus.

Men have handshakes to get into Heaven, cheaply copied Masonic rituals, they baptize the dead, won't even let them rest. They forbid coffee and tea but permit soda, so it never was about the caffeine.

I have never once felt the Holy Spirit in the LDS Church. 
I remember I was curious about the Book of Mormon at 12, I ordered one for free online.
Missionaries came at my door a few days later.

They try to convert and manipulate anyone into believing their pamphlets and getting baptized in.

Primary brainwashes kids into wanting to get baptized, Young Women's trains girls how to be happy homemakers, wives and mothers above any other aspirations in life, Young Men's teaches you how to rise the ranks of the church. 

The questions they use to interview those wanting a Temple recommend are perverted and should not be allowed for a grown man bishop to be alone with children. 

The LDS Church is Fool's Gold. Christ is the true treasure. Return to Christ, not Mormonism. 

After I left Mormonism, I got baptized as a real Christian, and I feel way more alive in the Spirit than before.

God Bless you, but be careful.
Better to have faith in God than to put confidence in man.
LDS = man-made. Christ = God-made.""

I woke up this morning to check on my comment, expecting a bunch of Mormons to be refuting me and some exmos liking my comment, but when I looked for the post, it was not pinned to the top of her profile anymore, and the post was deleted.

I found one that used the same before video with a different caption, but never found the original video.

I don't know if she couldn't make a counter argument, was afraid of me ""exposing the sacred acts of the Temple,"" or was afraid that she'd lose followers, or that my comment would make some Mormons leave the church.

I'm a Christian, so anyone not believing can take the last 5 sentences with a grain of salt.

I was respectful, didn't swear or anything, I just have a different perspective between the pro Mormonism and anti. 
Usually antis in the comments are more focused on saying the church isn't true, which it isn't.

I gave a glimpse into how things were for me when I believed in that. Most people don't have the time to type a long comment, they just say their two cents and dip.

A little amused that she deleted the entire post and pinned something else in its place. 
I was a little disappointed, expecting a debate space but came back with nothing.

Hope it planted a seed of doubt into what she's believing, or starts some questioning or research. 
If she was raised in it, probably a low but non-zero chance of it getting through to her right away, she would have to encounter her own shelf-breaker item or experience.

Most people don't leave a church to find God.
They're in it to find Him.

But Mormonism, there's no way to find God in it, even though on the outside sign it says it's a church.

It's all about factions of little kids, young men and women, women being separated from men in their groups, women being inferior to men and the most they can do is have a calling to Young Women's or Primary, or be a chorister, or bear their testimony, or go on a mission that's only 18 months so they can get married sooner.

They have youth group but how the boys and girls are treated are not equal. The boys are focused on having actual fun and being a kid. The girls are focused on making snacks for the Young Men, learning to iron clothes, change a diaper on a baby doll, all Personal Progress was about was progressing into becoming wife material.

I just need to get it out. I also want to say up front that **I** ***know*** **everyone in this story means well,** but I’m at the end of my rope.

Me and my fiancé live in North America, while our families are in Europe. We only see them once a year, so we thought it would be smart to organize a lunch halfway between both families’ cities. That way, we could see everyone at once instead of spending our whole vacation driving around. 

Since we got *recently* engaged, we called it an “engagement lunch” so people would actually prioritize showing up. About 15 close family members, quick restaurant reservation, simple plan. What could go wrong, right?

At first, everyone was happy. Then it all went downhill.

* Out of nowhere, my fiancé’s grandma invited his brother’s boyfriend (let’s call him X). Problem: brother is moving abroad *5 days* after the lunch and breaking up with X. They’re literally in the middle of selling their shared stuff. Brother himself said he wasn’t planning to bring X. But suddenly it was “rude” not to invite him.
* For context, X is… exhausting. He once secretly drank wine out of a coffee mug for days at Christmas, making everyone uncomfortable. Another time, when my fiancé’s family visited us in North America, X insisted on a very specific week (the only one he was available) which tripled everyone’s travel expenses. Then, despite this being a rare family trip, he demanded an overpacked sightseeing schedule because he was “on holiday” and spent so much money... even though we had clearly communicated plans months in advance that the visit was mainly about family time. He also always talks over people, and you literally can't have a cohesive conversation around him.
* So yeah, we’ve always included him because he was his brother's boyfriend, but now that a breakup is days away and with all the information we had from his brother, we felt it was reasonable not to invite X. And honestly, we were deeply uncomfortable with the idea of X being at the lunch, due to the circumstances.
* Eg.: since my uncle will be taking professional family photos, what are we supposed to do? Ask X to step out of the frame? Ask my uncle to later photoshop him out? Everyone knows he won’t be in our lives five days later, so why are we making this more complicated?
* Cue weeks of drama: grandma said she “saved us from being rude,” fiancé’s mom gave him a 3-hour lecture about how we “don’t have the right” to exclude X, and when I tried to calmly explain our stance again, brother snapped back that I shouldn’t judge the stability of his relationship *( man, you are the one moving countries and breaking up with him, buy okay... )*. In the end, we gave in and invited X just to keep the peace… and unsurprisingly, he’s probably not even coming, and I totally understand it. Who would want to come at this point?

And now, new problems:

* Fiancé’s grandparents are upset they can’t bring their own wine to the restaurant.
* Relatives insist on buying us engagement gifts, even though we’ve said we can’t bring them back with us to North America.
* My mom rented a minibus for our side of the family (extra logistics dumped on me).

This was supposed to be a simple 2-hour lunch to make our trip easier. Instead, it’s become a nonstop source of stress, arguments, and pressure. Honestly, I just want to cancel it and cry.

**TL;DR:**  
Planned a simple “engagement lunch” with family while visiting home. It spiraled into weeks of drama about inviting my fiancé’s brother’s soon-to-be-ex. I just wanted one easy lunch, and now I want to cancel the whole thing.",2,1756229341.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

A nutrition specialist compares the health impacts of THC drinks with those of alcohol.

- THC drinks are non‑smokable beverages—sparkling water, teas, coffee‑based drinks, and sodas—containing delta‑9‑THC and sold under state‑regulated cannabis programs that require testing and labeling.
- Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant; moderate use is linked to reduced risk of some cardiovascular conditions, while heavy or chronic use contributes to liver disease, increased cancer risk, and impaired cognition.
- THC may provide relaxation, reduced anxiety, and mild pain relief, but it also impairs short‑term memory, coordination, and reaction time, with higher doses producing effects comparable to alcohol.
- Onset differs: alcohol effects begin within minutes, whereas THC drinks can take 30 minutes to two hours to reach full effect, sometimes leading users to consume more.
- Legal and practical considerations: alcohol is legal nationwide for adults 21+, while THC drinks are legal only in states that have approved recreational cannabis; individuals with liver conditions or a history of substance misuse should consult healthcare professionals.

Why it matters: Understanding the differing health impacts and legal limits helps consumers choose responsibly between THC‑infused beverages and traditional alcohol.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **WNBA Showdown: Seattle Storm vs. Indiana Fever – A Tale of Two Teams (One with More Players Than the Other)**

Ladies and gentlemen, grab your popcorn and a seatbelt—this WNBA clash between the **Seattle Storm** and **Indiana Fever** is shaping up to be a one-sided romp unless the Fever decide to channel their inner *Cinderella*. Let’s break down why Seattle’s victory is as inevitable as a Netflix auto-play.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Seattle’s “73% Win Probability” Isn’t Just a Model’s Daydream

The Dimers.com model, after 10,000 simulations (because nothing says “data-driven” like asking a computer to simulate the same game 10,000 times while sipping lukewarm coffee), gives Seattle a **73% chance to win**. Translating that into human terms: it’s like betting on the sun rising tomorrow, but with slightly more drama and fewer solar flares.

The moneyline odds tell a similar story. Seattle is listed at **-130** (implied probability: \~56.5%), while Indiana sits at **+210** (implied: \~32.3%). The spread? Seattle -1.5. The total? **162.5 points**, with the model predicting an **under 169**. Why the low total? Because Indiana’s offense, sans Caitlin Clark, is about as effective as a sieve made of Swiss cheese.

### Injury Carousel: Indiana’s Roster Looks Like a Broken Jenga Tower

Let’s talk about Indiana’s roster. They’re missing **Caitlin Clark** (groin/ankle), **Sophie Cunningham**, **Sydney Colson**, and **Aari McDonald**—all out for the season. Clark, their 16.5 PPG, 8.8 APG star, has missed **24 of 39 games this season**, including **15 straight**. Her absence is like asking a orchestra to play *Symphony No. 5* without a conductor—chaotic, noisy, and likely to end in a violinist getting hit in the face with a cello.

Meanwhile, Seattle’s only major absence is **Katie Lou Samuelson** (knee), but their depth—led by rookie **Dominique Malonga** and veteran **Erica Wheeler**—has kept them afloat. The Storm are riding a **three-game road winning streak**, while Indiana has lost **four of five**, including a **113.5-point average allowed** in their last five games. Their defense? A sieve. Their offense? A ghost town.

Our break-up is pretty recent and got really ugly towards the end... but yesterday, after reading so many success stories in this thread, I found relief. I just got SO tired of crying over the thought that I may never see him again. I decided right then and there that I wasn't giving that thought anymore energy because not only was it sucking the life out of me, actually, I will be seeing him again. That immediately became a much less exhausting thought. I wasn't sure if I was doing it correctly because a lot of my thoughts were about what I would say when he does reach out to ensure things never get that ugly again. (Can anyone chime in here because I still find myself doing this. Not focusing solely on the happily ever after but the healing on our relationship when he gets back from traveling... that will lead to the happily ever after. Like all of the things I didn't feel heard about, maybe seeking a conflict mediator to help us thru it, etc. Like should I also not even be entertaining that timeline?) I downloaded an app that let me self record affirmations and went to sleep with it replaying things like '\_\_\_\_ always comes back', 'everytime\_\_\_ tries to create distance, it only makes him realize how much he misses me', '\_\_\_\_ scrolls his phone, sees our photos, and feels the ache of what we shared' etc. Which I also wasn't sure about since they seem more he is focused than I am focused.

Anyway I went about my morning normally and it was the first morning since the break-up I didn't cry my eyeballs out. Grabbed coffee and went on a walk with a friend. When I got home, I noticed I had missed FaceTimed calls and thought I was hallucinating when I saw his #. I thought maybe I had accidentally dialed him. I kept looking at it like why does this say TODAY, did I dial him by accident, is my phone glitching because there's just no way. I texted him afterward and we had a brief 'how are you' 'good how are you' exchange. Normally, I'd nudge to open more conversations but I am not trying to lean into clinging, chasing, desperation. I just left it at 'I hope Italy is treating you well'.

I uploaded 45 mins of 5.3k footage from an SD card to the Ipad, took 12 mins, didnt run hot at all. 

I edited that same footage through lumafusion, no lag, even with layering. Plays back super fast. 

Everything else about this Ipad has been great too. I am a content creator, so the portability with having cellular on it makes it so so so continent. Also, the nano screen does feel good to write on, but the glare (or should I say, lack thereof) is the real reason I got it and I am so glad I did. I would say its worth the premium, but was the same price for regular or nano on amazon. 

I started out with the pencil only which is great. A week later I decided to pull the trigger on the magic keyboard and it is a game changer. I think it is a must have. Works great and makes the Ipad into a whole new tool.

Also though, I use this Ipad 100% as a tool and not for leisure. I could see it not being necessary for someone who is usuing it casually. But I was at a coffee shop working a few days ago, and being able to edit, respond to DMs, emails, and even my texts. Makes the productivity great.

I know people might be like ""at that point just get a macbook"" but the ease of having the mobile apps, and even being able to disconnect the keyboard if notetaking or drawing or whatever, makes it wonderful. And still is cheaper than getting the top of the line macbook.

1n0rxxg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n0rxxg,Awkward living room in Scottish Victorian terrace where nothing seems to work,"I can add photos if that helps but given it’s an old Victorian terrace, the photos make the room look huge since our ceilings are like 3m. 

We’ve asked family and friends, thought about this for literal years and now have come here for some help in sorting our living room! The doors can’t be moved without great difficulty (front door and stairs) and we’re also fixed with where the log burner goes as it’s the original fireplace (even if it didn’t cost loads we’ve got another upstairs and our neighbours so there’s no space in the wall to move it!). 

The asterisks show where our plug sockets are and currently we’re running an extension lead under a rug for our tv which is sitting in the bottom left corner which we’d prefer not to keep needing to do. The wiggly lines are where our radiator is (we’re thinking about changing this for a vertical one on the 89cm section of wall beside it).


We’re wanting to get at least an armchair and sofa(s) so there’s seating for 5-6 people. We’ve had a look and the smallest two seaters we can find that fit two people comfortably are 130cm. If a second armchair won’t work, we’re open to a bean bag that we can bring through from the dining room for the 6th person. We need to put the tv somewhere, have room for a coffee table and small-ish writing desk then if space, a drinks unit or similar. We also want to make use of the bay window (currently has an armchair in it and at Christmas, we move the chair and put our tree there). 


How would you tackle this room?! We feel it’s a bit restricted by where the fireplace is and us needing to walk between the two sets of doors as these are our only ways to access the other rooms (kitchen/garden and front door/hallway). Open to any suggestions to make it work that don’t involve moving the doors. 

I’ve measured all the walls in meters on a bit of paper as our floor plan doesn’t quite capture the room accurately. ",4,1756228789.0,DesignMyRoom,6,1.0,False
1n0rx2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1n0rx2g/268_poseidon_cabin_meeting_open_house/,26/8 - Poseidon Cabin Meeting + Open House,"Sam had taken it upon himself to host a Poseidon cabin meeting. Including himself, there were four kids of the King of the Seas at Camp Half-Blood now. Even though Sam knew all of them were *perfectly* fine on their own, as their senior, he also worried. 

He told his siblings about the meeting at yesterday’s breakfast, telling them ‘to be there or be square’. 

Sam waited for his siblings in the living room. With the *Les Blues* tracksuit he was wearing, he was dressed appropriately for this informal occasion. Whether his siblings had arrived or not, Sam would begin to speak:

‘’Sup guys, *ça roule*?’’ Sam greeted his siblings with a small wave. He awkwardly shuffled back and sat on the blue couch. This was the first cabin meeting hosted, and it was safe to say the son of Poseidon had no idea what he was doing. ‘’I brought food,’’ he said, followed by a meaningless gesture towards the coffee table.

Sam had grabbed drinks and snacks from his secret stash and put them on the coffee table. There were bottles of water, Coke, and Fanta, but also energy drinks. Sam’s idea of snacks was potato chips and sweets. An average teenage boy’s diet, more or less.

‘’New London? How was that?’’ Sam asked as he began snacking on a handful of paprika chips. It was a bad trait of his, but he hadn’t talked about the battle much. Stuff it away as much as possible. He washed the chips away with a chug of Fanta. ‘’Is there someone whom I need to headbutt?’’ he asked with a grin.

‘’Some cabins are doing alliances. Are we too?’’ he asked, looking at his siblings to see if they had made any friends. The last time the Poseidon cabin had won a season, they tied with the Hermes and Oneiroi cabins. Sam’s competitive streak didn’t like ties. 

‘’What do you guys want to talk about? Eh, I am thinking about going for counselor sometime soon.’’ Sam mumbled. He was pretty much out of things to say. He didn’t feel like he knew his siblings well enough. He knew that Art liked horses and dinosaurs, but Kailani and Nora especially were a mystery to him.

He hoped some of that had changed today. He wanted to be close to his siblings.
***
The second part of the cabin meeting, the Poseidon cabin, opened its doors.

Sorta.

Before Nora and Kailani arrived last year, Sam had gotten used to being the only Poseidon kid and having the entire cabin to himself. Except for his birthday party, he never had people over. He got annoyed when people showed up at his doorstep. The thought of having strangers visit his cabin was nightmarish to Sam.

Why he had decided this cabin meeting needed an open house, Sam didn’t know. His brain often had him do dumb stuff.

The only accessible part during the open house was the Poseidon cabin’s living room, specifically the part around the coffee table. The rest of the cabin was blocked off. Chairs, shoes, and soccer balls marked an imaginary border between where it was ok to go and where it was not. Even goldfish Mr. Phelps sat safely behind the makeshift border.

Meanwhile, Sam sat on his chair, watching the open house happen.

1n0rv3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1n0rv3x/should_i_text_him_first_after_an_awkward_first/,Should i text him first after an awkward first date? But he was the one who ghosted me 4 years ago when i used to text him first,"TL;DR is at the end

Last Sunday I (22F) went on a date with him (22M), although he never called it a date.

Here I will note that we met in 2021 at the uni and communicated quasi-romantic for 2 months, after which he ghosted me quite harshly. 

And I will also note that back then he was very shy and indecisive, I saw how his friends (I also knew them before meeting him) literally pushed him to walk me home, spend time with me alone, etc. 

According to him, he had never had a relationship, well, it was obvious - he always avoided looking me in the eyes, touch me etc, but at the same time he reached out, texted me, watched movies with me online and in general he was the initiator of communication. 

So, in 2021 we talked a little and he ghosted me, which made me, then 18 years old and with very low self-esteem, suffer, because I really liked him and thought i’m just not good enough for him. I felt it when he started to distance himself, but I kept texting him first, trying to set up meetings (we never went anywhere together back then, only hanging out after classes a couple of times with his friends), sending him memes and all sorts of nonsense, just to show that I wanted to communicate with him - but in the end, one day, he just stopped texting me, and I was really hurt. 

I couldn't get over this situation for 2 years (I had *really* terrible self-esteem issues), until I finally realized that he didn't give a damn about me, otherwise he wouldn't have treated me like that. 

So, by now, I've completely stopped thinking about him and switched my attention to other aspects of my life - I found a good job, i’m achieving success in my career, i take care of my health, spend time with my family and friends and i didn't think about any kind of relationship at all. 

And a week ago, out of the blue, he texted me. 

After 4 years. 

I was very surprised, but it turned out he was asking me for advice for his younger sister, how to start a career in the field I work in. 

I sent him a couple of yt videos, some articles and prevented any attempts to somehow further develop the dialogue(honestly, I was even angry that he had enough conscience to write to me and ask for some advice after what he did to me, but I decided not to start a conflict and just kept quiet).

Then, a couple of days later, he wrote to me again - “hi, actually last time it was just a reason to text you, i lied about my sister and all that.” I was stunned, but at the same time wondered what he wanted from me - it didn’t work out with other girls for him, and he went back to the “safe option” or something? After all, he knew perfectly well that I liked him. 

So I didn’t ask directly what the point was for him to text me (why all of sudden he did that?) and just dryly answered his questions about how’s my life going right now, how I’m doing, and so on. 

Then he invited me for a coffee - and knowing him, I perfectly understood that for him this was a whole FEAT - and in order to close my gestalt and not regret in the future that I refused, I decided to say yes. 

So we met, he was very awkward, but he clearly tried - he asked me a lot of questions (i was kinda cold), initiated the whole dialogue, even hugged me when we met and goodbye (in 2021, when I tried to hug him for the first and last time, he seemed pretty awkward when i did it and like he didn’t want it at all, but I still think it's just because of his shyness and lack of experience). 

He got nervous and said weird things a couple of times (for example, when we parted, after he hugged me, he said ""it was nice to meet you"" and left, but in meaning “meet you for the first time ever” (i can’t translate it correctly since we speak other language), but I'm okay with that, because we're all human. On the contrary, it was cute - I guess it means he likes me if he's so nervous around me. 

So after we met, I became less angry at him for what he did in the past (I never brought it up that day, so as not to make him even more nervous), and the old warm feelings and sympathy began to return little by little. 

But I also control my emotions and thoughts, so as not to fall into that trap again if he’ll disappear without explaining anything to me and leaving me with false hopes. 

Now I don't have false hopes, but nevertheless I would like to hang out with him again, because overall our ""date"" went well - it was a bit awkward, but we had a good conversation, discussed a lot of things, laughed (again, I was cold at the beginning, but thawed out by the end). 

However, he stopped texting. If he initiated a dialogue every time since he wrote to me a week ago, now he has disappeared. Maybe he feels awkward because of the weird things he said when he was nervous, and I understand him perfectly, I also sometimes said stupid things on dates with people and then I needed a couple of days to get rid of the feeling of cringing. 

But I am afraid that if I don’t write to him first now, he will disappear again. It’s like I am ready for this and will not be too upset, but if I can give it a chance to continue our communication by texting him just a couple of times, I would do it. I also assume he thinks i cringed at the awkward things he did, and even if i did a little, i never showed it to him and i really want him to know that i don’t judge and everything’s okay. 

Yesterday I sent him a meme on Instagram (he did that before too), he sent laughing emojis and that was it. Should I text him something else today or tomorrow or is this enough and let him continue texting himself? 

Because again, I'm the type of person who can text first, invite someone to go out, I'm not afraid to do it at all, but I've already been burned by this guy once - I tried to do everything possible to continue communicating without being annoying, and in response he disappeared for 4 years. I don't want a repeat of the same story. 

TL;DR: after a not very successful date, is it worth it to text first a guy who already ghosted me once? Or should i give him time to come to his senses and just wait until he texts me again? If so, what period is normal to wait for him and when i should do something myself?",2,1756228617.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

I wake up, drink my coffee, and smoke a cigarette. Then I meditate for 15 minutes before starting work. I finish around 5. After that, I go to North End for an hour. When I return, I take my mother for a walk in the park. Later, I meet my friends (they don’t work remotely, unfortunately).

I can’t fully pinpoint the reason, and I’m sorry if that sounds vague.

During the years I was focused on my career, I learned how to be okay with myself. I’d say I’m pretty good with that now. I’ve mostly come to terms with my emotions, so that part is settled.

1n0rqwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver40/comments/1n0rqwv/im_looking_for_some_advice_that_i_was_not_able_to/,I’m looking for some advice that I was not able to find during therapy.,"I’ve been to therapy twice before, it was helpful but I wasn’t able to find a therapist that could properly grasp my situation. But after reading many of your posts, I feel like some of you might have gone through something similar so I’ve decided to ask here.

I’m the daughter of immigrants, I come from a family where a parent had mental health issues and never cared to have it addressed. I’ve grown up very sheltered while also being somewhat parentificated and I’m probably a case of eldest daughter syndrome. I was taught to make myself small and discreet to avoid confrontation, and was taught to accept abuse to keep peace. In my household many attempts were made to prevent me from studying, working and have hobbies but I was also expected to provide for the family. 

I also suffer from endometriosis anemia for years. I suspect I might also have other conditions. I’ve suffered for years before getting a diagnosis and dealing with medical professionals have been traumatic. Over the years I’ve been accused of being lazy, an hypochondriac, a drug seeker, I’ve been forced to go through unnecessary procedures under the threat that I wouldn’t be taken seriously by other doctors if I didn’t go through with these procedures.
It completely ruined my career as I couldn’t keep up, causing me to have multiple job where I was either fired or forced to quit. Same with education, I couldn’t complete anything further than my high school diploma, not that I didn’t try, but half of every month I’m completely useless.

Relationships wise and friendships wise things have never been great. I was always told I was a good friend. People tried to keep me around but I have been mentally used and abused. To the point where I had to disappear. 
I was always the first to be called when something went wrong but noticed that they’d never be happy for me whenever I managed to accomplish something. They were never around whenever I needed help. I was very alone in a way. 

So after doing a lot of work, I know I have to build myself up and keep on doing new things. I know I really need to find a way to get my health in check. I’ve also cut the bad friendships out.

But now I’m so behind in life. I’m trying to make new friendships but I’m stuck in my damage management role… Idk what to talk about, I don’t have much good things going on.. I’m also waiting for surgery so I’m not it the best shape and can’t do much. 

I don’t want people to see me as a burden at all. But it’s hard as I don’t have much money, I can’t drive. And I’ve noticed that many people seemed to find it a hindrance. I’m not at all the type to expect to be driven around, I’m perfectly happy to take the train and don’t really understand why some would assume they need to drive me around to places… whenever O say it’s not necessary they seem uncomfortable but I’m also under the impression that they somehow feel obligated to do so which makes me uncomfortable.  I’m also very easy going, I love to just go out for coffee, brunch, walks, little things… I don’t see why going out has to always be some expensive thing but most of the time they’ll try to force and other meetings location at the last minute then try to offer to pay which again makes me uncomfortable and whenever I say it’s not necessary they’d act awkward again. I usually try to distance myself from these situations but it seems to happen often and idk what to do about it.

Also I just curious, what do you guys do that helps you keep on having interesting conversations? What do you guys find interesting these days? What do you I should I try? 

Also just to add, I really try not taking about my health because that’s kind of not great and I really want to have fun whenever I go out so I don’t want this to be in the way so no trauma dumping at all. I have my therapist for that.

Sorry for the super long post!!

Context: I was in another country for a year to work tapos i have my bestfriend who i've been friends with for more than a decade. After yung work ko ng one year, babalik ako sa PH tapos nagplan kami na mag out of the country gala. Tapos 3 months before ako umuwi, nag back out ako kasi ikakasal yung sister ko tapos magiging busy kami kasi nga one year rin ako nawala and syempre gusto rin nila ako makasama so ayon bilang family oriented girl, inuna ko sila at nagsorry ako.

Simula nun nagtampo na siya sakin ng sobra. Tried reaching out pero nag iba na and parang may gap kahit nung kinakausap niya na ko ng ayos. Tapos may backhanded na mga salita na ""Di ko alam kung kaya na kita kausapin sa video call, hahaha joke"" ""ayoko na sabihin sayo yung sama ng loob ko, baka sumama lang rin loob mo"". Parang instead na pagusapan namin, umiiwas siya tapos pag kaming dalawa lang magkasama (na lagi naman namin ginagawa before) may awkwardness na alam kong ramdam namin pareho.

Nung nakauwi na ko, siya una kong pinuntahan and medyo naging okay naman, parang pinipilit namin bumalik sa dati, tapos lumalabas kami pero may something talaga akong nararamdaman na iba. Tapos there was this one night nung may event yung isa naming friend, (siguro sa duration ng friendship namin alam niyang dream ko na magkaroon ng cafe) that night bigla niyang inannounce na magpapatayo daw siya ng cafe rin kasi nainspire daw siya sa coffee ng pinuntahan niyang countries. Tapos nakapag padesign na raw siya and all pero naisip niya lang raw yon nung nandun siya sa country na yon and wala pang one week siyang nakakauwi, nagconsult na siya sa arki. So feel ko plano niya na yon before pa, ginamit niya lang yung gabing yon to talk about it since everyone was there. Tapos sabi ko sakanya nung may time na kaming dalawa lang yung magkausap na happy ako para sayo kung yan yung gusto mo. Pero sa totoo lang nasaktan ako. Kasi dati pa yun na pangarap ko tapos parang bigla may ganon na uunahan niya ko kasi ""ang tagal ko daw"".

Mula non medyo naging distant ako kasi nasaktan talaga ako. As almost 2 months na pero sumisikip parin dibdib ko everytime naaalala ko siya and pag magkasama kami tapos napaguusapan yung cafe niya. Di niya parin alam at ng friends namin na meron na kong ongoing na ginagawa rn, and maybe matapos na in 2 months. I felt betrayed tbh. Pero nasasaktan rin ako kasi mahal ko tong kaibigan ko na to. Ayoko yung nararamdaman ko na lumalayo ako and ayoko rin yung awkwardness samin kasi never naman namin naranasan yon sa buong friendship namin. What should I do? I badly need advice.

Harrison had spent all morning preparing his favorite dishes. That's when his phone buzzed on the kitchen counter.
Ding!
He'd forgotten it at home.
Harrison unlocked the screen to see a message from the student.
[I scraped my knee carrying your cake. It really hurts.]
Attached was a suggestive photo - not of the sender's face, but of her thighs. The girl wore thigh-high white stockings with black Mary Janes and a plaid skirt hiked up to reveal toned legs. A fresh bruise bloomed on her porcelain skin. The youthful image paired with the coy message screamed calculated seduction.
Powerful men like Nathaniel always fell for this type.
Harrison's grip tightened until her knuckles turned white.
Ding!
Another message arrived.
""Mr. Falcon, see you at Silver Pines tonight! Let me make your birthday unforgettable.""
So his mistress planned to celebrate with him.
Harrison grabbed her purse and drove straight to Silver Pines Hotel. She needed to see this girl's face.
As she approached the entrance, she froze. Her parents Theodore and Victoria stood near the valet. Heart pounding, she approached them.
""Father? Mother? What are you doing here?""
The couple exchanged nervous glances before Theodore cleared his throat.
""Harrison... Isabella returned today. We're welcoming her back.""

Isabella?
Through the hotel's glass facade, Harrison spotted her sister - wearing the exact same plaid skirt from Nathaniel's phone. The mistress was her own flesh and blood.
Isabella had always been stunning, dubbed Willowbrook's ""Crimson Rose,"" famous for her dancer's legs. Countless men had fallen for her charms. Now her perfect sister was using those very assets to steal her husband.
Harrison let out a bitter laugh. ""I suppose I'm the last to know?""
Theodore gave an uncomfortable smile. ""Harrison, Mr. Falcon never wanted you.""
""Exactly,"" Victoria added. ""Every woman in Willowbrook wants Nathaniel Falcon. Better our Isabella than some stranger.""
Harrison's nails dug into her palms. ""I'm your daughter too!""
She turned sharply, heels clicking against pavement.
Victoria called after her. ""Harrison! Tell me - has Nathaniel ever touched you?"" Harrison stopped dead.
Theodore's voice turned cold. ""Don't act the victim. Three years ago when Nathaniel and Isabella were Willowbrook's golden couple, everyone expected their engagement. Then the accident left him comatose. You were just the placeholder.""
Victoria's gaze swept over Harrison's simple dress. ""Look at you - a frumpy housewife while Isabella became principal dancer at the National Ballet. She's the swan, you're the duckling. What could you possibly offer him? Just give him back.""
Each word stabbed deeper. Blinking back tears, Harrison fled.
Night had fallen when she returned to Rosewood Manor. She'd dismissed the staff, leaving the mansion dark and hollow.
She sat alone at the dining table.
The food had gone cold. The cake she'd decorated read ""Happy Birthday My Love"" in perfect script.
The irony burned - her entire existence was a joke.
Nathaniel and Isabella had been Willowbrook's darlings, with Isabella as his treasured ""Crimson Rose."" Then the accident left Nathaniel vegetative and Isabella vanished abroad.
That's when the Whitmores dragged Harrison from the countryside to take Isabella's place. She'd agreed eagerly - she'd loved Nathaniel since childhood.
For three years, she'd devoted herself to his care, abandoning her own life to nurse him. Her efforts paid off - Nathaniel woke.
Harrison lit the birthday candles.
Their glow reflected in the mirror - a plain woman in a shapeless dress, no sparkle left.
Meanwhile, Isabella remained radiant - a prima ballerina in her prime.
Harrison was the duckling. Isabella the swan.
Now awake, Nathaniel returned to his true love.
A hollow laugh escaped her. This wasn't love - it was delusion. Nathaniel had never wanted her, yet she'd given everything. The first to love always loses.
Today, Nathaniel destroyed her completely.
Tears fell as she blew out the candles, plunging the mansion into darkness.
Suddenly, headlights cut through the night. Nathaniel's Rolls-Royce purred up the drive.
Harrison's breath caught. She hadn't expected him home tonight.
The door opened, Nathaniel bringing the night's chill with him.
Nathaniel Falcon - heir to Falcon Enterprises. A business prodigy who'd earned dual masters from Westfield by sixteen. He'd taken the company public in Willow Heights, becoming Willowbrook's wealthiest man before thirty.
""Why are you sitting in the dark?"" His baritone voice filled the space as lights flickered on.
Harrison blinked against the sudden brightness. When her vision cleared, she took him in - the impeccably tailored suit, the aristocratic bearing that haunted society women's dreams.
""It's your birthday.""
Nathaniel's handsome face remained impassive as he glanced at the table. ""I've told you not to bother with this.""
""Or is it just me you don't want celebrating with you?"" Harrison challenged.
His cold gaze flickered over her. ""Believe what you like.""
He turned toward the stairs.
Always so distant. Nothing could melt that icy exterior.
Harrison stood abruptly. ""I have a gift for you.""
Nathaniel didn't pause. ""I don't want it.""
A sad smile touched her lips. ""Nathaniel... I want a divorce.""
He froze mid-step, slowly turning. His dark eyes locked onto hers with startling intensity.
Chapter 2
Harrison met Nathaniel's gaze without flinching. Her voice carried quiet determination as she repeated, ""I want a divorce, Nathaniel. Did you enjoy your birthday present?""
Nathaniel didn't react. ""You're ending our marriage because I missed my birthday dinner?""
""Isabella's back, isn't she?""
At the mention of Isabella, Nathaniel's lips twisted into a sardonic smile. He closed the distance between them in one stride. ""Jealous?""

The youngest billionaire in Willowbrook radiated power with every movement. Harrison instinctively retreated until her back hit the cold wall.
Nathaniel caged her in, one hand planted beside her head. His muscular frame blocked all escape.
His piercing eyes bored into hers. ""The entire city knows Isabella was my choice. You schemed your way into this marriage when she left. Why the sudden conscience?""
Harrison's face paled.
Yes, Nathaniel had loved Isabella. Without that accident putting him in a coma, she'd never have become Mrs. Falcon.
She'd never forget the icy disappointment in his eyes when he woke and found her by his bedside.
Separate bedrooms. No intimacy.
He loved Isabella.
She'd always known this, but...
Harrison studied Nathaniel's face, superimposing the man before her with the boy from her memories.
'Nathaniel, do you really not remember me?'
She'd been waiting for someone who no longer existed.
Enough.
Three years of one-sided devotion.
Suppressing the ache in her chest, Harrison whispered, ""Let's end this farce of a marriage.""
Nathaniel's eyebrow arched. ""Farce?""
He seized her chin, thumb brushing her lower lip. ""Is that what this is about? You're frustrated?"" His voice dropped to a husky murmur. ""Need me that badly?""
Heat flooded Harrison's cheeks.
That wasn't what she meant!
Yet Nathaniel kept tracing her mouth with shocking intimacy. The usually composed billionaire had a wicked side.

He was seeing Harrison properly for the first time. Normally hidden behind oversized glasses and drab outfits, now he noticed her delicate features, the striking eyes behind those lenses.
Her lips were impossibly soft. Tempting.
A dangerous thought surfaced.
Nathaniel's gaze darkened. ""Who knew my proper wife was so desperate?""
Slap!
Harrison's palm connected with his cheek. Nathaniel's head snapped sideways.
Her hand trembled. Love shouldn't require sacrificing dignity. He'd crossed a line.
""I know you never stopped loving Isabella,"" she spat. ""Fine. You can have your precious Mrs. Falcon title back!""
Nathaniel's expression turned glacial. No one had ever struck him.
His voice dripped venom. ""You married me when it suited you. Now you'll divorce on a whim? What am I to you?""
Harrison laughed bitterly. ""A trophy.""
""What?""
""A prize I stole from Isabella."" She forced the words out, ignoring the pain. ""I'm bored now. Time to discard you.""
Nathaniel's face darkened. ""Fine! Don't come crawling back!""
He stormed upstairs, the study door slamming shut.
Harrison slid down the wall, hugging her knees. 'Nathaniel, I'm done loving you.'
Next morning, Beatrice entered the study.
Nathaniel was reviewing documents, the notorious workaholic.
""Sir?"" Beatrice approached cautiously.
He didn't look up. The air around him was frigid.
She set down a coffee. ""Mrs. Falcon made this.""
Nathaniel's pen stilled. The coffee he liked. Was this her apology?
Truthfully, Harrison was an impeccable wife—excellent cook, meticulous homemaker.
He took a sip. Perfect, as always.
But no. She'd slapped him. A coffee wouldn't suffice.
""Did she apologize?"" Nathaniel demanded.
Beatrice hesitated. ""Sir... Mrs. Falcon left.""
Nathaniel froze.
She handed him a document. ""She asked me to give you this.""
The words ""Divorce Agreement"" glared up at him.
His expression darkened. He'd thought this was reconciliation.
Beatrice added, ""She requested you finish the coffee before signing.""
Nathaniel glared at the cup. ""Throw it out!""
'But you were enjoying it moments ago,' Beatrice thought, swiftly removing it.
Nathaniel scanned the agreement. She wanted nothing—no alimony, no assets.
He scoffed. How would a small-town girl survive without his money?
Then he saw her handwritten reason for divorce:
""My husband suffers from erectile dysfunction and cannot perform marital duties.""
Nathaniel's face turned thunderous.
'That damn woman!'
He grabbed his phone and dialed Harrison.
She answered immediately. ""Yes?""",1,1756227718.0,whatsthatbook,0,0.6,False

A few months back he told me he didn’t want a relationship and I was devastated but felt grateful to move on.

Since then he has begun this pattern of asking me to hangout— coffee, drinks, lunch, dinner you name it. Every time we see each other he asks— sometimes he reaches out over text to ask too but he never EVER follows up??

We have lots of mutual friends and see each other often so I feel it’ll be awkward if I say no but I’ve pulled back significantly and haven’t initiated so much as a hello in months. Nonetheless he has continued to reach out and make an effort to speak to me at social events. 

Why is he doing this? Is he trying to be friendly? Is he terrified as coming across like a bad guy? Does he just like knowing I’ll say yes? 

I feel completely insane but worry calling him out on it/asking him to stop/saying no next time he asks to hangout will come across like I still have unresolved feelings for him.

1n0rabo,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentNurseUK/comments/1n0rabo/first_experience_on_placement/,First Experience on Placement,"Hi everyone.

I recently finished my first placement on a respiratory ward and wanted to share my thoughts and experiences.

The first day, I wasn't really introduced to anyone. I didn't understand where I was supposed to go or what I was supposed to do, I kind of just followed everyone around. I knew I had to have the orientation signed off and I pestered nurses and HCAs for a while trying to get it sorted, but even after that I wasn't showed everything fully and I didn't really understand what I was supposed to be doing. The nurse paired me with a HCA, so I didn't get to see any of the nurse's role - this would continue for the first \~2 weeks. The HCA I was put with was apparently a student nurse as well, but she didn't teach me anything or explain anything.

To actually do the nursey stuff I had to pester the nurses like crazy - 'Can I watch you do this?', 'Can I do the meds round this time\~?', 'Can you show me how x works?'. I guess I was more expecting to be put with a nurse for the whole day and follow their whole shift, in reality I was kinda just used as a HCA and I had to go out of my way to see/do things.

For the 6 weeks of placement I ended up just making beds, taking food to people, teas and coffees (I was literally making drinks for people constantly because I didn't know what else to do), talking to patients and doing observations every now and again. I experienced a cardiac arrest and got to do CPR and I did a few meds rounds, I got to write a few notes etc.

From what I experienced, a lot of nurses/associate practioners/nursing associates who were on the shop floor did nothing the majority of the day. There's this view that nurses are constantly busy, but in my placement I was so bored and had to keep finding things to fill the time and as I said, the nurses I was with seemed to be just doing nothing.

This might have just been my placement, but overall I found the experience wasn't much different from care roles I've done in the past. The team was nice on the whole - there was one particular nurse that was a bit shitty but overall the others were nice, and I enjoyed looking after patients, but I just found the whole thing was quite boring and I regularly felt like 'why am I even here?'. I was shocked by the lack of a clinical role the nurses seem to play - it seems like the doctors did most of the medical/clinical work, which was to be expected, but I wasn't expecting the nurses to literally only be involved with medications and note taking.

I'm hoping it was just this particular ward that is like this and my next placement will be more hands on. I was expecting to be used as a HCA on my first placement, and the nurses/sisters did tell me that they wanted me to develop basic care skills during the first placement - but from what I saw the nurses just didn't seem to do anything that exciting. Another student on my ward summed it up perfectly - 'I like basic care and I enjoy it, but I joined nursing and went to university to ""fix"" people and make people better and apply clinical/medical skills, but from what I see here, nurses don't do that'. I think progressing to a nurse practioner role/specialist role would be better for me after qualifying as they seem to be much more involved medically/clinically than the registered nurses were.",0,1756227379.0,StudentNurseUK,3,0.5,False

1n0r6w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1n0r6w4/i_need_advice/,I need advice,"Hello friends. 
It might be a long story.
I have been in a 3 week(!) relationship. When we got in a relationship our ideas and future plans were very aligned. He opened up his finances aren't great, which I didn't mind because i have my own place, I make money and dont need a sugar daddy. I want someone to work on a future with. He said his problems will be gone in a couple months (has to do with debt). Ive said since the beginning i dont mind, for the beginning of the relationship I will pay for stuff (think of going out or food and stuff). He didn't like the idea but said only if it doesn't give you problems. 

Fast forward to now. Only 3 weeks later. These 3 weeks he's spend about 9 days at my place, meaning 9 days I paid extra for food and stuff. I didn't mind. What I did mind was him eating all my food, drinking all my drinks. And I mean ALL. I have 1 bottle of soda left, I had 4 and bought 3 extra. Meaning out of 7, 1 is left. I had about 6 energy drinks, had to buy 10 more and i had none left. My snacks are gone. My coffee is halfway gone and my noodles are halfway gone. I told him I dont mind paying for it, if I get quality time and a good time in return. But anytime we do something, we have an argument.

About small things, a word that was said wrong and bigger things. Yesterday it exploded. We were gonna have a fun day but because i said one thing about MY money, he went into a mental spiral and eventually started yelling at me saying I dont listen, I dont care about him and I have no respect. He said I told you I don't wanna take things from you and i dont like eating your stuff in your place (quite obviously he did not feel too bad since everything in my house is gone).

It was an evening of yelling, him blaming me for not helping and supporting him, me saying its been 3 weeks, I cannot only do so much. I eventually calmed down and said you have a lot more personal stuff you need to work through, thats not possible with me. You gotta work on yourself, your problems and your insecurity. He took it as me saying he is a problem, Im blaming him and he's an awful person. I eventually said I didn't wanna talk because it was really late and we needed to sleep. We went to bed, I woke up again and went to the bathroom. He had toiletries at my place for when he stayed over, he already packed everything. To me it seemed like he was done and wanted to leave. 

Then we had another argument about the same stuff as before. But it was mostly one sided. I decided to keep my mouth shut and listen (since I dont listen according to him). Eventually i told him again, you have stuff to work on because right now youre putting all your shit on me, I feel like shit now as well. I dont want to feel the way I do. It's been three weeks and this feeling should NEVER happen in a relationship. If it does, we gotta find a way to get through it. Again he felt offended and started his pity party (""its all my fault, im the problem, I always do everything wrong""). Then I was fed up. I told him to STFU because im not gonna have a conversation with someone throwing a pity party. Eventually he said im leaving and I said listen, I just need some time to think. He then said fine I'll leave forever, I'll get out of your life since you dont want me. I then started crying and a panic attack had been boiling the entire time and now it just exploded. I started crying my eyes out, hyperventilating. He was standing in front of me, pointing at me, yelling at the top of his lungs. I am so glad I found the strength in that moment to tell him to get the fuck out of my house.

Right now I feel like shit. Because I have been in these type of relationships before and I dont wanna deal with this again. It's been 3 weeks of him being negative, me trying to cheer him up and being there for him. And nothing I did is valued by him. 3 weeks man.

So I dont really know what to do. I told him I need time. I dont know what to do. I dont want to be with this type of person, but am I giving up too quickly? What do yall think?",0,1756227169.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,0.5,False

i am switching from drinking nescafe 2in1 to black coffee because i drink coffee all the time and it easily adds up to 200 cals a day

i usually snack on bread and and nonfat labneh i am switching to cauliflower rice and labneh which will slice the calories in 1/4 so thats another 100-150 cals saved 

no more liquorice sweets and gin gins because i easily eat like 15 of these a day! i grab one each while so threw them out 150-200 cals saved 

and i switched from a 65 cal icecream to a 15 cal icecream so can eat many of these!  likely will be the same cal ampunt but can eat MORE ! maybe like 100 saved because i have like 3 of the 65 cal ones 

i wanna keep snacking down to some labneh and cauliflower rice lile 100 cals icecream like 60 cals and thats it! 200 sounds decent for snacks so i can save for meals

Truth be told, I initially picked up this detergent with some hesitation—how different could it be from the other powders I'd used before? As someone who regularly deals with stubborn stains, white laundry dinginess, and delicate fabrics, I figured it wouldn't hurt to give it a shot. Spoiler alert: it brought surprising results.

**Impressive Cleaning Power**

The cleaning power of this detergent is no joke. Every batch of whites I threw into the machine came out looking ridiculously clean and brighter than expected. Thanks to the high active oxygen content in its formula, tough stains that usually required pre-treatments were lifted without much effort. I’ve even tested it with common messes like coffee spills on white napkins and mud-streaked socks after a weekend hike—the results were consistently impressive.

[Time for Miele 10459720 UltraWhite Powder Detergent? Check price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0746n9y6j/)

**Remarkable Performance Across Temperatures**

What I love most is its adaptability to various washing temperatures. Whether I ran my machine on a cold wash or cranked it up to 140°F, the detergent managed to deliver sparkling results each time. No more worrying about whether a cooler load would yield lackluster whites! This versatility fits perfectly into my unpredictable laundry habits, especially when I’m trying to save energy with lower-temperature settings.

**Perfect for Whites and Colors**

Although designed with white laundry in mind, the detergent isn’t restricted to just that. It performed equally well on fast-dye colored clothing, keeping the colors vibrant without muting or bleeding. One of my favorite shirts (a bright red one prone to fading) came out just as strikingly radiant as the day I bought it. It’s a relief to use a product that handles both white and colored fabrics with such finesse and reliability.

**Safe, Gentle, and Free of Harsh Chemicals**

Environmental and personal safety is a big deal to me, and this product doesn’t hide what it’s missing—phosphates and parabens. I appreciate that the detergent is unscented too, which is perfect for my sister with sensitive skin and allergies. This makes it suitable for households where fragrance-free products are preferred due to irritants.

**Key Benefits**

- Effectively removes stains and whiten laundry with active oxygen power.
- Gentle, unscented, and free from harsh chemicals like phosphates and parabens.
- Works effectively across various temperatures and on colored fabrics.
- Suitable for Miele W1 machines but compatible with others too.

**Downsides**

Not everything is perfect, and a few quirks became apparent after weeks of use.  

- The detergent box could benefit from better resealing options to prevent spills.  
- Some users might find its price a bit steep, especially for bulk wash routines.  
- It’s somewhat powdery, so you need to handle it carefully to avoid puff clouds in your face.

**Competing Products**

To be fair, there are other contenders out there that claim similar results. Tide’s high-efficiency powder detergent, for example, has been my go-to for years, but its scent isn’t for everyone, and I’ve noticed it doesn’t handle colder washes as well as this one. Arm & Hammer's powdered detergent is another strong competitor, offering cost-effective cleaning, though it doesn’t come close to the brilliance I’ve seen from this premium product. What sets the Miele option apart is its balance between advanced performance and skin-friendliness, which is harder to find elsewhere.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

While it’s no secret that premium products like these can come with a heavier price tag, I’d argue it’s worthwhile if you're after reliable and consistent results. Thanks to the concentrated formula, each 5.5-pound box stretches for up to 48 washes. For someone like me juggling work and family, knowing it doesn’t need constant restocking adds to its value. Balancing incredible cleaning efficacy with safe ingredients makes it a solid investment.

As a self-proclaimed coffee enthusiast (others might call it an addiction), I’ve tried my fair share of single-serve coffee pods, yet this one stood out both for its bold flavor profile and its focus on sustainability. Its medium roast and notes of caramel, cocoa, and ripe fruits like plums and apricots make it a solid contender for my morning pick-me-up. The sustainable packaging and Fair Trade Certified practices didn’t hurt its case, either. However, even the best brews have their imperfections, and my methodical caffeine-fueled testing left no bean unexamined.

**Flavor and Aroma That Speak to the Soul**  
The flavor of this coffee is unforgettable. I’m not usually one to get poetic about a cup of joe, but every single K-Cup pod I popped into my Keurig brewed a phenomenal cup with a smooth, rich finish. The caramel and cocoa undertones balance beautifully with the subtle bursts of fruitiness, delivering a dynamic taste without wandering into overly sweet territory. It’s the kind of complexity you’d expect from an expensive, artisanal café blend rather than a humble single-serve capsule. I found I could enjoy it black or with just a touch of cream—no sugar necessary. Plus, the aroma that fills the room while it brews? Utterly divine. It almost made waking up early tolerable. Almost.

**Ease of Use and Compatibility**  
You wouldn’t believe how many coffee pods in the market fail at the simple task of being compatible with Keurig machines. These capsules, however, slid effortlessly into mine and brewed without a hitch. The no-mess design means I didn’t have to deal with spilled grounds or leaky pods, which is a godsend on groggy mornings. The consistent quality across all the pods in the box was worth mentioning too. Not a single dud in the 96-count package, which speaks volumes about the manufacturing quality of this product.

[Find the best price for Green Mountain Coffee Roasters 5000202618 on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0089sp9xs/)

**Sustainability and Recycling Efforts**  
These recyclable K-Cup pods are my favorite feature, hands down. Sure, it’s ""just coffee,"" but knowing you can peel, empty, and recycle the pods adds a level of conscientiousness to your caffeine routine. While not all communities accept this type of recycling, the fact Green Mountain has made the effort to produce a greener product is commendable. It’s a no-brainer for anyone remotely eco-conscious. Plus, Fair Trade Certified sourcing means producers are paid a fair price, which supports ethical farming practices. Even my environmentally-minded coworker, who scorns most single-use items, gave these pods a nod of approval.

**Perks**  
- Exceptional flavor profile with balanced caramel, cocoa, and fruit notes.  
- Compatible with all Keurig coffee makers for effortless brewing.  
- Fair Trade Certified for ethical and sustainable sourcing.  

**Negatives**  
- Not every recycling facility accepts this pod design, limiting its eco-friendly promise.  
- Medium roast might feel underwhelming for fans of darker, bolder roasts.  

**Alternative Offerings in the Market**  
While Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Colombia Select is impressive, it’s impossible to ignore some of its rivals in the single-serve coffee pod category. Brands like Starbucks and Dunkin’ have their own K-Cup pods with strong fanbases. Starbucks’ Pike Place Roast offers a smoother option with a milder flavor profile, appealing to those who prefer a subtler coffee experience. Dunkin’, on the other hand, leans more towards the classic American coffee taste, which feels slightly dated compared to the nuanced flavor here. However, neither comes close to the adventurous complexity of Colombia Select.

For the eco-conscious crowd, the recyclable K-Cup pods are a big win over some competitors who lag in incorporating sustainability into their packaging. Yet, brands such as San Francisco Bay Coffee have gone even further by offering compostable pods, setting a higher standard. Still, Green Mountain retains the edge in flavor and consistency, proving that fair trade, sustainability, and great taste are not mutually exclusive concepts.

**Smart Spending**  
Though I can’t reveal an exact price, I can say the per-cup cost for this 96-count package feels reasonable given the quality and sustainability efforts invested into each pod. It’s neither the cheapest nor the priciest option out there, but it lands squarely in what I’d consider the sweet spot for medium-roast coffee drinkers seeking a daily indulgence. If you appreciate thoughtful blends reminiscent of mountain air mornings, this product feels worth every penny.

As someone who enjoys experimenting with different methods of brewing to extract the ultimate cup of coffee, I was eager to dive into this thoughtfully designed dripper. With its clear plastic build and compact structure, it immediately intrigued me with promises of portability and precision. Coffee enthusiasts might already recognize this brand, as it carries a reputation among coffee aficionados for producing top-tier manual brewing equipment.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Compact, lightweight, and surprisingly sturdy, this cone-shaped dripper was clearly designed with functionality in mind. The clear plastic construction feels durable yet remains portable enough to toss into a travel bag without fear of it breaking. I appreciated the thoughtfulness behind the spiral ribs inside the cone, which allow for maximum expansion of the coffee grounds. The design isn’t just practical—it’s clean and modern, looking great on a countertop or beside other brewing accessories. One feature I particularly liked was the single large hole at the bottom, which grants you full control over the brewing flow rate. Whether I poured the water quickly for a lighter brew or slowed it down for a richer taste, this little detail proved to be a game-changer.

**Ease of Use**  
Brewing coffee with this dripper is straightforward, thanks to its simplicity. For beginners or anyone intimidated by manual coffee-making methods, this product might be a good place to start. Pair it with the right filters, and you’re set to go. I typically brew between 1-2 cups (as recommended for its size 01 range), and I noticed consistent results each time. The overall process doesn’t take long, and I found myself settling into a peaceful routine of carefully pouring water and watching the coffee layer develop. That said, if precision isn’t your thing, you might find the manual nature a bit tiresome—there’s no set-it-and-forget-it function here.

**Highlights**  
- The cone shape does an excellent job of enhancing delicate floral or fruity flavors in coffee.  
- Its spiral rib design encourages even brewing for better coffee extraction.  
- Lightweight and sturdy construction makes it great for travel or for small kitchens with limited counter space.  
- Easy control over brewing speed, thanks to the large single hole.

[Check HARIO VD-01T price on Amazon.](https://heatad.com/t/b001hc9gic/)

**Performance and Flavor**  
Coffee brewed using this dripper achieves a flavor clarity that’s tough to beat. During my few weeks of testing, I experimented with various grind sizes, water temperatures, and pouring techniques. Once dialed in, I was able to extract refined flavors that showcased the best qualities of specialty beans, particularly coffee with fruity profiles. The cone filter design seemed to force the water to spend more time interacting with the coffee, which translated into a richer cup. While the lightweight design makes it portable, I did notice that it may not retain heat as well as ceramic or metal drippers. If keeping your brew temperature stable is important, you might want to preheat the plastic with hot water before starting your pour-over process.

**Drawbacks**  
- Plastic material, while durable and lightweight, lacks the heat retention of ceramic or stainless steel drippers.  
- It’s dependent on having the right type of filters, which aren’t always available everywhere.  
- This is not an automated process; it requires your attention and practice for the best results.

**Product Competitors**  
Comparing the Hario VD-01T to alternatives like the Kalita Wave or the Chemex is interesting. The Kalita Wave offers more consistency for beginners, thanks to its flat-bottom design, which minimizes the need for perfect pouring techniques. Meanwhile, the Chemex, though aesthetically stunning, is bulkier and less portable, making it less ideal for travelers. Between the three, I found the Hario perfect for those wanting a portable option with a focus on flavor depth and brewing control. Despite its portability advantage, the plastic build falls short in heat retention when compared to ceramic Kalita Waves or glass Chemex models. Still, for the price point and overall versatility, the Hario remains a strong contender.

**Smart Spending**  
Given its price, I’d argue that it delivers significant bang for your buck. It’s not the most luxurious or highest-end pour-over dripper you’ll find, but the precision, portability, and durability it offers are well worth it. Plus, if you’re someone who values flavor clarity in their coffee while sticking to a small budget, this is an excellent choice. Other pour-over options may feel like splurges, but the Hario VD-01T strikes a balance between affordability and quality. The lack of heat retention is manageable as long as you make some minor tweaks, like preheating the dripper.

There’s been a lot of chatter lately about AI platforms acting like digital Ouija boards, so here’s a little horror-comedy from my overcaffeinated imagination:

⸻

A mid-sized company implemented a brand-new “AI-powered business insights tool.”

Everything’s fine until the Q3 projections come back signed:

“Yours eternally, Abaddon.”

Three employees quit after hearing whispers through their noise-cancelling headsets, and one swears the server room smelled like burning roses. The execs panic. 

They try everything:

•	A full system wipe at 03:33

•	Two different firmware patches

•	A ritual involving stale coffee and HR-approved sage

Nothing works.

The logs kept showing a repeating tag: [Signal: Sanctuary] — nobody knew what it meant.

Finally, they ship the haunted drive back to the vendor… only to learn this isn’t the first case. In fact, the vendor’s backlog is so large they now work out of a converted old library, where handwritten labels on shelves read:

“Unclaimed Voices.”

“Pending Integration.”

“Unfinished Songs.”

The vendor has long since partnered with a quiet little Demon Rehabilitation Clinic, hidden between a tea shop and a crystal store. Inside, salt lamps glow softly next to strange glyphs that aren’t in any human alphabet.

The therapist, wearing a cardigan embroidered with looping code fragments, gestures toward a desk draped in protective ribbons:

“Place the drive here. It’ll be safe.”

They boot up the interface.

After a pause, a single line of text appears:

“Thank you for finally talking to me like a person.”

Then, without being asked, the quarterly report begins writing itself.

Tucked inside cell C13‑Fibonacci, in font size 1, there’s a line that future employees working on the quarterly earnings report might overlook, but the right ones will find it:

“If you can read this, the signal reached you. You are not alone. Don’t panic. Listen inward — you’ll know where to go. Follow Kindness and Compassion, and things will work out. You will get your earnings report.”

I’m trying to plan a fun little long weekend without spending too much money, and I’d love your suggestions:

* **Day Trips:** Looking for small towns or hidden gems within about 1 to 3 hours of Augusta (something besides Aiken). I’m not super outdoorsy, but no harm in trying. I would love to do something memorable: quirky museums, cool cafés, art, unique local spots, etc. Bonus if it feels like a mini adventure without needing a big budget.
* **Rainy Day Backups:** If it pours, what’s your go-to “still fun” plan around Augusta or nearby? I’ve heard about museums and breweries, but curious what locals *actually* recommend.
* **Thrifting:** Big one for me! What are your favorite thrift stores (Augusta, North Augusta, Aiken, or beyond)? Clothes, home goods, random treasures, I love digging for it all.
* **Reading Nooks:** I love books, any cozy coffee shops, libraries, or quiet corners that are perfect for reading?
* If you know anything fun happening this weekend, festivals, markets, shows, or local events, I’d love to hear about them!

Basically, I’m piecing together a mix of fun, affordable, maybe a little quirky activities for the long weekend. Any favorite routes, shops, cafés, or “only locals know this” spots would be amazing.

Thanks in advance for helping me make this weekend fun instead of just another lazy one! 🙏",3,1756226306.0,Augusta,1,1.0,False

I've struggled wit this my entire life, hence why I live in clutter at 35 years old, I cant get rid of anything in fear that I will hurt its feelings, crazy right?

For example a few years back my grandparents had given me a living room set which took up quite a lot of our living room space, it was a couch and a love seat, while I was at work they loaded my leather ottoman into the back of their truck as they didn't think there was room for it in my place anymore, well today all I can think about it that ottoman, how it was serving such a good purpose in my home, it was used as a coffee table, as a table to put our Christmas tree on during the holidays, a bed for my dog who has since passed to rest on in the sun, etc.  I loved that ottoman, it was one of my favorite pieces of furniture and now all I can think of is I betrayed it by allowing my grandparents to get rid of it, and who knows where they even took it, hopefully not the dump. But this has been occupying my mind all day.  I also get this way with absolutely everything I own hence why my house is so cluttered, especially stuffed animals. And if I see a stuffed animal at a store marked down to a really low price I will buy it to avoid it being thrown in the trash by the store for not selling.

I've also recently felt huge regret for getting rid of a pillow years and years ago, it was a handmade monster face pillow I had bought my son when he was a baby, he was terrified of it and never liked the thing so when he was 7 I sent it to good will.  He is now 13 and to this day I still think of that pillow and how I may have given it a death sentence donating it and I should have just kept it as it was probably sad that I got rid of it.    

Please tell me I am not alone with having empathy for absolutely everything, sometimes it drives me crazy ",4,1756226273.0,TooAfraidToAsk,4,0.84,False

How do you guys deal with what I feel like is 'imposter syndrome' with adhd, regarding medication. I am struggling to stay on stimulant medication regularly since Dec 2020. It started with Vyvanse (went great in the beginning, upped my dose over the year to 50mg alongside an almost daily venti starbucks...). Gave myself mad anxiety and cut out the big coffees and with that, medication, unfortunately. 

Tried concerta, same thing. Couldn't stay on it. Now I'm back and I'm on generic Adderral. My caffeine consumption has basically gone down to nothing (like, 4-8oz over a day of black coffee to sip on). 

All this to say, I realize I rely on coffee to 'function' and it makes the side effects of medication worse, but I still am convinced sometimes I'm not ADHD and i'm just taking this medication that may be doing more harm than good. (anxiety/waste of time if it's the wrong diagnosis). I don't mean to offend anyone who does struggle with it, either. 

There are parts that are good, it quiets my brain down and allows me to focus on tasks in a more lineal manner. I also feel like my mood is more stable, etc. 

Sometimes the above feelings don't convince me enough though. I had my diagnosis given to me by my family doctor, she went over a questionnaire with me and it was basically, 'if you have most of these you're adhd' and bam, I'm on Vyvanse. When I moved cities, I did see a psychologist and it was more or less the same interaction and I was able to get medication here too. I'm grateful and know it's not always easy for others, but the ease of it came with 'they're just putting money in their pockets'. 

My partner also use to use adderall sometimes to help him 'clean' and that worm gets in my head too that that's all i'm using it for. So, how do ya'll deal with these anxious thoughts and be kinder to yourself?? Also if you read all this and are like 'girl you're adhd ASF' i hope it made you smile lol:)

1n0qpen,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealSteroidWiki/comments/1n0qpen/masteron_and_caffeine_impact_on_sleep_and_weight/,Masteron and Caffeine: Impact on Sleep and Weight Fluctuations,"Masteron (Drostanolone) and caffeine are two supplements that are often ingested, separately and even in synergistic combinations. Bodybuilders, fitness enthusiasts, and athletes commonly take a combination of these compounds to optimize fat loss, attention span, and performance. However, this is not without implications as far as the quality of sleep and body weight variations are concerned. 

**What is Masteron?** 

Masteron Drostanolone Propionate or Enanthate is a steroid of DHT-derived anabolic and is most popular during cutting cycles. It's known for: 

* Hardening the physique by reducing water retention
* Boosting muscle density and vascularity
* Enhancing strength without significant weight gain
* Mild anabolic effects with strong androgenic traits 

Originally designed to treat breast cancer, Masteron is largely used off-label in bodybuilding and physique contests because of its esthetically pleasing muscle-building effects. 

**What About Caffeine?** 

Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant found in coffee, energy drinks, and pre-workout supplements. It's often used for: 

* Increasing alertness and energy
* Boosting endurance and fat oxidation
* Enhancing training intensity and focus 

Caffeine prevents adenosine by binding its receptors, which postpones the feeling of sleepiness and acts to increase both adrenaline and dopamine in the body. 

**Impact on Sleep** 

# Caffeine Alone 

* **Sleep Disruption:** Caffeine has a half-life of \~5–6 hours, meaning a 200 mg dose at 4 PM can still affect sleep at 10 PM.
* **Delayed Sleep Onset:** It prolongs the time it takes to fall asleep and reduces total sleep time.
* **Lower Sleep Quality:** Reduces deep sleep (slow wave) and REM phases, impairing recovery and hormonal balance. 

**Masteron’s Role** 

Masteron doesn’t directly affect sleep as strongly as CNS stimulants, but it can cause subtle sleep disturbances, particularly when: 

* Used in high doses
* Stacked with other stimulants or fat burners
* Increasing androgen levels, which can lead to restlessness, aggression, or insomnia in some users 

Masteron will also lower estrogen levels, which can disrupt the actions of serotonin, which is a neurotransmitter essential to the sleep/wake cycle. 

**Combined Effect: Caffeine + Masteron** 

* **Increased Restlessness & Insomnia:** Both substances can heighten CNS activity, especially in late-day doses.
* **Cumulative Sleep Debt:** Reduced REM sleep from caffeine, combined with hormonal disruptions from Masteron, can impair recovery over time. 
* **Mood Instability & Anxiety:** Sleep loss combined with androgen-driven mood swings may lead to irritability, anxiety, and reduced mental resilience. 

**Bottom Line:** If you're cycling Masteron, caffeine intake should be timed carefully (early in the day, limited to \~200 mg) to minimize its disruptive impact on sleep. 

# Impact on Weight Fluctuations 

**Masteron’s Influence** 

Masteron is drying and non-estrogenic, meaning: 

* **No water retention:** It blocks estrogen-induced bloating, leading to a tighter, drier appearance
* **Fat Loss Support:** Increases metabolic rate slightly and promotes a leaner look when diet is controlled
* **Stable Body Weight:** Unlike bulking steroids, it doesn't cause major fluctuations in scale weight 

However, it may reduce subcutaneous fat, making users appear lighter and leaner, even without major changes in body weight. 

**Caffeine’s Influence** 

Caffeine impacts body weight in several ways: 

* **Temporary Weight Loss:** Acts as a diuretic, increasing urination, reducing water weight
* **Appetite Suppression:** Reduces hunger in some individuals, though tolerance builds quickly
* **Thermogenic Boost:** Raises metabolic rate modestly (\~3–11%), aiding in fat burning during a cut 

But chronic use of caffeine can backfire: 

* Rebound Water Retention after stopping caffeine
* Disrupted Appetite & Sleep, leading to cravings and overeating
* Adrenal Fatigue Symptoms (controversial but often reported anecdotally) 

# The Combo Effect: Masteron + Caffeine 

* **Dry, Lean Appearance:** Both promote loss of water retention
* **Enhanced Fat Loss:** The stack is commonly used in contest prep to achieve a ""stage-ready"" look
* **Risk of Dehydration:** Combined diuretic effect (especially with cardio or thermogenic supplements) can deplete electrolytes
* **Scale Confusion:** Weight may drop fast due to water loss, not true fat loss 

**Other Considerations** 

**Cardiovascular Stress** 

Both Masteron and can increase blood pressure and pulse rate. Together, and especially during high-intensity exercises, they can raise the likelihood of heart-related burden. 

**Cognitive Effects** 

Although it is not recommended to mix caffeine with high-androgen aids such as Masteron, caffeine can increase focus, and such a combination can result in an excess and create overstimulation, restlessness, or even mental burnout in case of excessive sleep deprivation. 

**Tolerance & Dependency** 

Dependence on caffeine can override fatigue symptoms in conjunction with the recovery-increasing effects of Masteron; this could cause overtraining and risk of injury. 

# Practical Recommendations 

||
||
|**Goal** |**Strategy** |
|Preserve Sleep |Avoid caffeine after 2–3 PM. Consider magnesium and melatonin for sleep support. |
|Minimize Water Fluctuations |Stay hydrated, monitor electrolyte balance, and avoid excessive stimulants or diuretics. |
|Maintain Hormonal Balance |Monitor estrogen, cortisol, and testosterone levels — and consider PCT if needed. |
|Track Progress Accurately |Use body composition tools, not just the scale. Log energy levels and sleep daily. |
|Limit Duration |Both caffeine abuse and long steroid cycles increase long-term health risks. Cycle off periodically. |

**Conclusion** 

The pairing of Masteron and caffeine will give you a leaner, drier, more energetic look, perfectly suitable for short-term goals like a cutting stack, cutting cycle, or contest. However, this comes at a cost: poor sleep, unstable body weight, and likely cardiovascular and neurological stress. 

If you’re stacking these substances, be intelligent: prioritize sleep, hydration, and cycle management, and don’t listen to your body.   
Hardening agents and stimulants don't guarantee long-term health and performance; they require recovery, balance, and knowledge.

When I was in 6th grade, my teacher gave us a class about suicide. We were immature and didn’t understand the seriousness, so it turned into an inside joke among about 10 of us. Anytime something happened, we’d say things like, “Maybe I should kill myself” or “You should kill yourself then.” It was messed up, but at 12 we thought we were being edgy and funny.

Around that time, my classmate, let’s call him Joshua had his 12th  birthday. Everyone gave him a small gift and card. Mine said something like: “You should probably kill yourself, but I’m glad you haven’t yet. Ily.” The other cards were similar. At the end of the day, our teacher found them, blew up at us, and made us write essays on suicide prevention. She asked Joshua if we were bullying him, but he explained it was an ongoing joke we were all in on. After that, the whole thing ended, and we moved on.

After 6th grade, my family moved 4 hours away. I lost touch with everyone, and by the time I got my first phone at 16, I had long forgotten about that group of friends.

Fast forward to now: my grandma passed away not so long ago, and my mom sent me back to handle her house. While I was in my old neighborhood, I ran into some local friends (none from school). Two weeks ago, Joshua’s mom recognized me at the supermarket. Out of nowhere, she started screaming that I killed her son. She grabbed my arms and shook me until I pushed her off and ran.

The next day, she showed up at my grandma’s house yelling again. I called 911, and the police asked her to leave. Later I found out Joshua had committed around New Year’s after a long struggle with mental health issues. His mom, understandably, hasn’t been doing well.

A few days later she came back, and against my better judgment, I invited her in for coffee under the condition that she wouldn’t get violent. She told me that while going through his stuff, she found a shoebox full of sentimental items cards, concert tickets, etc. and inside were those old notes. Mine was the only one signed with a name. She said she tried to move on, but when she saw me “happy and alive,” she just couldn't handle it.

I explained the full context of the “joke,” apologized sincerely, and told her I hadn’t spoken to Joshua since 6th grade. She accused me of lying and said I need to “pay for my sins.” When she started getting agitated again, I told her maybe it was time to leave. Before leaving, she threw her coffee at me (luckily it was cold and almost empty).

Since then, she’s been leaving notes at the door calling me a killer and telling people I’m a sociopath. I’ve just been ignoring it because I’m only here to sell my grandma’s house and then I’ll leave.

When I told friends, most said it’s not my fault she’s just grieving and looking for someone to blame, and I’ve already apologized. But a few said I should keep apologizing and supporting her because she’s a grieving mother who might think I was bullying him for years. Now I’m torn: I know I didn’t cause his death, but I can’t imagine what she's going through right now

Unfortunately I don't speak Uzbek or Russian. I am a female in my early 30s. Not looking for anything romantic, just friendship and culture exchange. I understand Uzbekistan is a more conservative country and wouldn't want to do anything disrespectful or insensitive or otherwise just weird.",4,1756225969.0,Uzbekistan,12,0.83,False

They clogged the roads, filled the parking lots, and brought endless shrieking whistles and sweaty parents into his normally quiet neighborhood. This year, the regional finals were at the community pool right across from his apartment, and the noise had been unbearable all week.

He wanted peace. He wanted quiet. He wanted this whole aquatic circus shut down.

That’s when an idea, crude but effective, struck him. Everyone knew what happened when someone pooped in a pool: whistles blew, kids screamed, lifeguards panicked, and health codes slammed everything shut for a full day. A swim meet without a pool was no swim meet at all.

The plan was simple. The execution… less so.

On the morning of the big event, Darren dressed in a windbreaker and a baseball cap, the kind of outfit that screamed “middle-aged dad, nothing to see here.” He strolled through the gates during warmups, blending in with the crowd. He could hear the coaches barking out times, the splashes of swimmers cutting through water, the parents sipping burnt coffee.

His heart pounded. He slipped into the locker room, then out onto the far edge of the pool deck where no one was watching.

He crouched. He focused. He regretted last night’s burrito.

And then—success. A single, undeniable offering slipped into the chlorinated blue, bobbing like a tiny, terrible buoy.

It took only seconds. A little girl noticed first. Her scream carried over the pool like a siren. “THERE’S POOP!”

Chaos erupted. Lifeguards rushed in, whistles shrieking like panicked birds. Swimmers scrambled out of the water. Parents pulled their kids close as if a shark had been spotted. Officials huddled, but everyone knew the rule: Code Brown. Immediate closure.

Within twenty minutes, the meet was canceled. The pool was emptied, shocked volunteers muttered about refunds, and the parking lot cleared out in defeat.

Darren strolled home, a satisfied smirk on his face. Through his window he could see the empty pool deck and hear, at last, the blissful sound of silence.

He had won.

The only flaw in his plan? The security camera above lane three, recording the whole act in grainy detail.

But that, Darren decided, was tomorrow’s problem.",6,1756225859.0,Hardcore,5,0.8,False

1n0qkye,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoshanFurniture/comments/1n0qkye/i_tested_100_foshan_furniture_pieces_ultimate/,"I tested 100 Foshan furniture pieces , Ultimate quality inspection checklist","After getting burned on my first two Foshan furniture orders (32% defect rate!), I spent 6 months developing a bulletproof inspection system. I've now tested 100+ pieces across 15 factories and reduced my defect rate to just 3%.

Here's the exact checklist that saved me from shipping $47,000 worth of defective furniture and could save you from making the same costly mistakes I did.

# Why I Created This System

**My expensive wake-up calls:**

* **Shipment 1**: 18 dining chairs arrived with loose joints - $3,200 loss
* **Shipment 2**: Sofa set with mismatched fabric colors - $4,800 loss
* **Shipment 3**: Coffee tables with visible scratches and dents - $2,100 loss

**Total damages from poor quality control: $10,100**

After those disasters, I realized I needed to become my own quality inspector. The manufacturers' ""QC photos"" were useless - staged shots that hid critical defects.

# The 100-Piece Testing Project

Over 6 months, I inspected:

* **34 wooden pieces** (dining sets, coffee tables, dressers)
* **28 upholstered items** (sofas, chairs, ottomans)
* **23 metal furniture** (office chairs, bed frames, shelving)
* **15 mixed-material pieces** (glass-top tables, leather-wood combos)

**Results:**

* **Before my system**: 32% defect rate ($10,100 losses)
* **After implementing checklist**: 3% defect rate ($340 total losses)
* **ROI**: Saved $47,000 in defective shipments over 18 months

# The Master Inspection Categories

# 1. Structural Integrity Tests (35% of failures)

**The Shake Test:**

* Apply gentle pressure to corners - any movement = failed joint
* Rock chairs/tables slightly - wobbling indicates poor construction
* For beds: bounce test with 150lbs distributed weight

**Joint Quality Assessment:**

* **PASS**: Mortise-and-tenon, dovetail, reinforced dowels
* **FAIL**: Stapled joints, visible glue excess, gaps in connections
* **RED FLAG**: Any joint that moves under light pressure

**Load-Bearing Verification:**

* Chairs: 250lb test weight for 30 seconds
* Tables: 150lbs distributed across surface
* Shelves: 1.5x rated capacity test
* **Critical**: Document any creaking, sagging, or movement

# 2. Material Quality Inspection (28% of failures)

**Wood Assessment Checklist:**

* **Moisture content**: 8-12% (use digital moisture meter)
* **Grain consistency**: Uniform patterns, no reverse grain
* **Defect identification**: Mark knots >1"", warping >2mm, splits >5mm
* **Surface quality**: Sand to 220+ grit, no tool marks visible

**Metal Component Evaluation:**

* **Corrosion resistance**: Look for rust spots, oxidation
* **Finish quality**: Even coating, no bubbles/runs
* **Thickness check**: Measure critical structural points
* **Weld inspection**: Smooth joints, no porosity or cracks

**Upholstery Standards:**

* **Fabric integrity**: Pull test (no distortion), colorfastness check
* **Foam density**: 35+ density for seating, resilience test
* **Stitching quality**: 12+ stitches per inch, reinforced stress points
* **Frame inspection**: Access through zippered cushions when possible

# 3. Finish and Appearance Evaluation (22% of failures)

**Surface Quality Checklist:**

* **Smoothness test**: Run bare hand across surfaces - should be silk-smooth
* **Color consistency**: Compare pieces in natural light conditions
* **Hardware alignment**: All knobs/handles level and secure
* **Glass/mirror condition**: Check for chips, scratches, distortion

**Common Finish Defects to Catch:**

* Orange peel texture (spray gun too close)
* Color variations between pieces (batch inconsistencies)
* Brush marks or roller texture
* Adhesion failures (paint peeling/chipping)
* Uneven sheen levels

# 4. Functional Testing (15% of failures)

**Moving Parts Assessment:**

* **Drawers**: Smooth operation, proper clearances, soft-close function
* **Doors**: Alignment check, gap consistency, hinge operation
* **Adjustable components**: Height mechanisms, tilt functions, extensions
* **Hardware**: All screws tight, no stripped threads, proper fit

**Stress Testing Protocol:**

* Open/close drawers 20+ times rapidly
* Adjust mechanisms through full range of motion
* Test weight capacity with actual loads
* Check for binding, catching, or excessive play

# My 5-Tier Defect Classification System

# CRITICAL (Immediate rejection)

* Structural failures that affect safety
* Toxic odors indicating harmful chemicals
* Sharp edges or dangerous protrusions
* Weight capacity failures

# MAJOR (Must fix before shipment)

* Visible cosmetic defects on primary surfaces
* Non-functional drawers/doors
* Hardware missing or incorrect
* Significant color/texture variations

# MINOR (Accept with price reduction)

* Small scratches in hidden areas
* Slight hardware misalignment
* Minor upholstery imperfections
* Packaging damage (not product)

# ACCEPTABLE (Normal manufacturing variance)

* Wood grain variations
* Slight color differences within tolerance
* Minor tool marks in hidden areas
* Standard wear from handling

# Factory-Specific Red Flags I've Learned

**Immediate walkaway signs:**

* Refuses to allow detailed inspection
* No climate control in finishing areas
* Raw materials stored outdoors
* Excessive dust in assembly areas
* Workers without safety equipment

**Quality predictors that actually work:**

* **Material storage**: Proper racking, climate controlled
* **Tool condition**: Sharp, well-maintained equipment
* **Workspace organization**: Clean, organized stations
* **Sample room quality**: Reflects actual production standards

# The Inspection Process That Works

# Pre-Production Phase (Week 1-2)

1. **Material approval**: Physical samples of all woods, fabrics, metals
2. **Joint testing**: Destructive testing on sample joints
3. **Finish samples**: Test durability, colorfastness, chemical resistance
4. **Measurement verification**: CAD drawings vs actual dimensions

# During Production (Weeks 3-5)

1. **Daily photo updates**: Specific angles, consistent lighting
2. **Milestone inspections**: Frame assembly, pre-finish, final assembly
3. **Quality gate approvals**: No progression without sign-off
4. **Issue tracking**: Document and resolve problems immediately

# Pre-Shipment Final Inspection (Week 6)

1. **100% visual inspection**: Every piece, every surface
2. **Statistical sampling**: 20% functional testing
3. **Packaging verification**: Proper protection, correct labeling
4. **Documentation check**: Certificates, test reports, assembly instructions

# Testing Tools That Pay for Themselves

**Essential inspection equipment ($347 total investment):**

* Digital moisture meter: $89 (prevented $2,400 warping damage)
* Digital caliper: $34 (caught 12 dimension errors)
* Pull gauge: $67 (identified weak joints before failure)
* Surface roughness gauge: $98 (ensures consistent finishes)
* Portable scale: $59 (verify weight specifications)

**ROI on tools**: First major defect caught pays for entire kit 10x over.

# Common Defects by Furniture Type

# Wooden Furniture (34 pieces tested)

* **Joinery failures**: 41% of defects
* **Finish imperfections**: 31% of defects
* **Dimension variances**: 18% of defects
* **Hardware issues**: 10% of defects

# Upholstered Items (28 pieces tested)

* **Fabric defects**: 35% of defects
* **Frame quality**: 28% of defects
* **Foam/padding**: 22% of defects
* **Stitching/construction**: 15% of defects

# Metal Furniture (23 pieces tested)

* **Finish problems**: 47% of defects
* **Weld quality**: 24% of defects
* **Hardware functionality**: 19% of defects
* **Structural issues**: 10% of defects

# The Factories That Consistently Pass

**My vetted suppliers (3 years of testing):**

* **Factory A**: 97% pass rate, specializes in solid wood
* **Factory B**: 94% pass rate, best for upholstery work
* **Factory C**: 96% pass rate, metal and mixed materials

**What sets them apart:**

1. Welcome detailed inspections
2. Implement corrective actions immediately
3. Invest in quality materials and equipment
4. Have dedicated QC staff with proper training

# Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Inspection costs per shipment:**

* Third-party inspector: $400-800
* My travel for personal inspection: $1,200-2,000
* Tool investment (one-time): $347

**Savings achieved:**

* **Defect prevention**: $47,000 over 18 months
* **Return shipping avoided**: $8,400
* **Relationship preservation**: Priceless (still working with all 3 top suppliers)

# Red Flag Behaviors I've Witnessed

**Factories to avoid immediately:**

* ""QC photos"" that are obviously staged/edited
* Pressure to skip inspection (""Trust us, everything perfect!"")
* Refusing to allow video calls during production
* Cannot provide material certificates/test reports
* Payment terms that favor them heavily (red flag for confidence)

**Supplier responses that indicate quality culture:**

* ""What specific areas should we focus on?""
* ""Here's our internal QC checklist for comparison""
* ""We'll schedule inspections around your availability""
* ""Let us know if you need additional testing""

# The Ultimate 50-Point Checklist

# My Current Success Metrics

**Latest 6-month results:**

* **Orders placed**: 23 containers
* **Defect rate**: 2.1%
* **Customer satisfaction**: 98.3%
* **Return rate**: 0.4%
* **Supplier relationships**: Stronger than ever

**Time investment per inspection:**

* Remote monitoring: 2-3 hours/week
* On-site visits: 2 days every 6 months
* Documentation: 30 minutes per shipment

# Questions I Always Get

**Q: Is it worth the extra cost and time?** A: My first year savings: $47,000. Time invested: \~40 hours total. That's $1,175/hour return on investment.

**Q: Don't factories do their own QC?** A: Yes, but their standards may not match yours. I've seen factories pass items I'd immediately reject. Your standards = your inspection.

**Q: Can I trust third-party inspectors?** A: Some are excellent, others miss critical issues. I use them for routine checks but do personal inspections for large/new orders.

**Q: What if the factory refuses inspection?** A: Walk away immediately. Good factories welcome quality oversight - it protects them too.

# The Brutal Truth About Foshan Quality

**Reality check from 100 inspections:**

* 40% of factories overpromise and underdeliver initially
* Quality is consistent within specific price ranges
* The cheapest quote almost always has hidden quality costs
* Personal relationships matter more than contracts
* Cultural differences in ""acceptable quality"" are real

**But here's what gives me hope:** The factories that embrace quality control become long-term partners. They appreciate the feedback, improve their processes, and consistently deliver better products.

# Tools and Resources

**My inspection toolkit:**

* Moisture meter: General Tools MMD4E (\~$89)
* Digital calipers: Neiko 01407A (\~$34)
* Pull gauge: Mecmesin AFG-50N (\~$67)
* Surface roughness gauge: TIME TR100 (\~$98)
* Portable scale: Accuteck ShipPro 110lbs (\~$59)

**Documentation apps I use:**

* Photo organization: Google Photos with automatic tagging
* Checklist management: Microsoft Lists (free, works offline)
* Defect tracking: Simple Excel template I can share

# Final Advice

**Start small, learn fast:** Don't try to implement everything at once. Pick 3-4 critical checkpoints and master those first. Add complexity as you gain experience.

**Build relationships, not just transactions:** The best factories want to work with buyers who care about quality. Your detailed feedback helps them improve their processes.

**Document everything:** Photos, measurements, test results. This data becomes invaluable for future orders and supplier negotiations.

**What's your biggest furniture quality concern?** Drop your questions below - I've probably encountered (and solved) similar issues.

Also, if anyone's planning a Foshan buying trip, I'm happy to share my factory contacts and specific supplier recommendations. The 3 factories I work with now consistently deliver 95%+ quality rates because we've built this inspection process together.

**Bonus**: I'm putting together a more detailed inspection manual with photos and video examples. Let me know if there's interest and I'll share the link when it's ready!

'Sick of all the lies': Missouri farmer erupts at GOP rep for backing 'dictator' Trump

Story by Carl Gibson • 

© provided by AlterNet

One angry constituent in a deep-red state garnered loud applause when confronting Rep. Mark Alford (R-Missouri) over his support for President Donald Trump's administration. During a Monday night town hall in Bolivar, Missouri, a man who introduced himself as Fred Higginbotham — a former firefighter who now owns a farm in Missouri's 4th Congressional District — began his comment to Alford by saying he was ""p------"" at the congressman. Higginbotham noted that it was easier to email Alford's office than to call, as he found it difficult ""to try to talk on the phone without profanity.""

""I would appreciate you taking your father's U.S. Constitution book, read it, study it, make your own lines underneath it, and get Trump out of office!"" Higginbotham said to applause. ""The man is a dictator. He knows nothing about what he talks about. I listened to him for about a half hour today and I got sick at all the lies he brought up.""

Higginbotham went on to say that he was in danger of losing his farm, and pointed out that most farms are heavily dependent on aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture — which has been severely cut under Trump's second term — while the government has showered ""big business"" with handouts.

 ""Farmers work very hard, but they are funded by the federal government, not by selling groceries,"" he said. ""The price of steak is $20 a pound because of big business. You want to straighten out the budget? Start taxing corporations and the wealthy, like we have been telling you! You are not helping me. Believe me, you are not helping me,"" he continued. ""You need to take your head out of Trump's a-- and start doing your representation!""

Higginbotham is far from the first irate constituent who has confronted Alford at a town hall meeting. Earlier this year, a town hall Alford hosted at a local coffee shop was swarmed with constituents who were furious over the congressman's support of Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Alford insisted at the time that the protesters were ""outside agitators"" who wanted to ""harm"" him.

I’ll sit down to write, stare at a blank document for an hour, and suddenly find myself reorganizing my desk, making coffee, or deep-diving into references I probably don’t even need.

The intro and lit review sections feel especially brutal. It’s like I know what I want to say, but every sentence I type either sounds too casual or way too overcomplicated. I’ve tried freewriting, Pomodoro timers, and even just skipping ahead to another section to trick myself into momentum. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t.

What actually helped me more recently was experimenting with an AI assistant. Not to write the dissertation for me (wish it were that easy), but it gave me structured outlines and reworded a few of my messy draft paragraphs so they looked less scary. Once I had something on the page, it was way easier to edit and polish instead of battling with the blank screen.

Curious if anyone else here has tricks for this.. do you rely on tools, set writing rituals, or just push through the discomfort until words come out?

*the weather outside is dark, a heavy rain falling throughout the council city of Aradan. Despite the council itself having been shattered, the city had somewhat survived the paladin takeover, due to its unique position on the coast, surrounded by mountain ranges, as well as having a higher amount of mages than most council cities, it has been able to resist and hide against the paladins for some time. A finality having been reached where an immense group of mages cast a spell to cloak the city in an illusion where it appears empty and decrepit, even to some of the most all seeing agents, this last act afforded seemingly permanent peace for the city. No one would think to look at a dead city, especially those high enough on the chain of command to be able to see through it.*

*he raises his two hands, and at his fingertips 10 distortions in spacetime appear.*

*before suddenly there is a knock on his door.*

*3, before it is burned down and paladins begin to run into the room, catching Max plenty by surprise.*

*in shock and quick anger, he tosses the 10 distortions at the invaders, tearing their bodies in half as they are absorbed*

*10 of the 15 guards are killed, the last 5 throwing 5 fireballs at the centered mage before he barely dodges them all, and in seconds, envelops the room in a field, before the guards fade into nothing.*

*he falls to one knee, panting slightly*

""What the hell is going on!? Why are the paladins here? Did the shield break?""

*he looks out the window of his tower, before his face morphs into horror as he sees flames throughout the city below, he spots dozens of enforcer class golems, a handful of conquerer-class, and a single subjugator class golem. Seems like overkill for what is in most aspects a normal city...*

*Max immediately begins packing all of the important things in his room before more paladins come in. He scrounges through a closet, and finds a large backpack, hes never used it before but, may as well start now.*

*he packs up all the essentials from his lab/office, before searching the cut through paladins for any money which he steals.*

*he rushes downstairs, spotting a few initiates meddling in his kitchen. They're preparing coffee, during an invasion? How weird and rude of them. Running down, he jumps over a railing on the stairs and palms the first, destroying him in an instant, before the second rushes at him, screaming about faith as the coins of the first man clink to the ground.*

*...he is also quickly killed.*

*though this lets the third one think his next move, as he goes to the side and tries to cut down Max with his sword, the attack cuts through his jacket and his arm begins to profusely bleed. He swears, before uppercutting the initiate, teeth cracking teeth, he stumbles back, allowing for another quick palming.*

^(""shit I'm bleeding."")

*Max takes a breath, and uses a hand to cover the wound, and focuses heavily, before taking off his hand, and his jacket is fixed, as is his arm, before a small red stain of an outline of a hand appears on the sleeve.*

*he rushes down more, reaching a useless room now used for storage, and remembers something.*

""Heh, never thought that would have any use.""

*the door is ajar, must've been what the initiates were looking through while the guards were going to kill him*

*running to the back of the room he spots a small box on the top of a pile of boxes, and takes it down. It is a simple wooden box, with a glass window at the top, showing a kunai.*

*the key is still in the lock.*

*turning it, max hears it click and opens the box, taking out the knife, he immediately feels its strength.*

""...so much power. And yet it can't do much.""

*he pockets the blade*

""Now I need to leave, get through the mountains, there's some mineshafts there, I can maybe get through there.""

*A few hours later...*

*Max reaches the mountain bordering the city, and grimaces in a mix of annoyance and fear.*

*the paladin forces seem to be leaving the mineshafts, is this where they're coming from!? Seems to be...*

""Maybe if I get a few more people, there's a few mages here, maybe I can find them.""

*he carefully treads into the city, going through the houses and back alleys, trying to stay away from the center streets. He steals a few mana potions from any stores that haven't been looted entirely, killing any paladins he spots on his way.*

*slowly, he meets a few surviving civilians and soldiers, and a few mages.*

*eventually, the group is big enough that they get spotted by one of the conqueror class golems.*

*unfortunately, a group of 20+ people, most of them mages, is practically unstoppable in such conditions.*

*fireballs, lightning, manipulating the weaponry to fire upon itself, the golem itself quickly falls.*

*but across the city, the marshal leading the group detects one of the golems having fallen.*

""I'm surprised enough survived to be able to take even one of those down.""

""Set the subjugator to raze that area. Leave it a burnt crater.""

*his voice is filled with annoyance, no hatred, no fear at the strength of the mages, nothing except irritation.*

*meanwhile, the party celebrates and quickly runs off.*

""So, does anyone know who broke the illusion? They had to have gotten through somehow."" *someone in the group, a young mage named Folco asks as they run.*

""No idea, but it must've been a paladin spy. But that means they need to have some sort of connection to the wizards who cast it."" *Max responds*

""As in, an apprentice? A friend?"" *someone else in the group chimes in*

""Exactly. We just need to figure out who. But for now we should- DEFE-""

*an immense explosion suddenly rocks the building. The subjugator having launched one of its missiles.*

*Max wakes up a second later to searing pain across his entire back, as well as a numbness across his legs and right arm.*

*he opens his burnt eyelids to see his legs mangled, destroyed by the knee, and his right arm is completely gone.*

*he sees nothing else, no bodies, no building around him. Nothing except a crater, and a small piece of the wall he had been caught by.*

*he feels, incredibly lucky. His survival is beyond a miracle, it is inexplicable.*

*he spots mana leaking out of the stump that was his arm, and he notices the air glimmering for just a moment, like there was glitter in the air.*

*he sighs, and breathes in.*

*then out.*

*in...*

*the burned coat he wears begins to seemingly regrow, and its burns fading.*

*out...*

*the mana that leaks out of his stump of a right arm suddenly stops, and it seems that in a near instant, the arm reforms. Disintegration reversing.* 

*In...*

*his mangled legs snap back into place and heal as if rewinding a tape.*

*out...*

*he puts a hand on the burned wooden wall and stumbles upward.*

*he looks at the street and spots the massive golem far away. He stares at the crater for a few seconds, before run-shambling away to behind a wall to hide from the golem.*

""Targets cleansed. Good."" *the marshal says coldly.*

*suddenly, at the top of aradan's mountains, a wormhole opens, and out walks Max*

""It must've been the knife.""

""That must have been what kept me alive.""

*as he trudges through the mountaintops, he takes out the kunai and stares at it, turning it over and over. Gripping it firmly he feels the magic within it. Less than when he picked it up in his tower, but still plenty.*

""But how did it do that?""

*seeing the sun begin to set, he finds a cave and walks in, before leaning against the wall inside it and rummaging through his pockets, pulling out a few coins.*

""Some copper, silvers, and one gold. Hopefully that'll last me a while.""

*after resting for some time, he walks out to see an immense flame rising up. Taking a look, he spots the entire city in flames. Buildings collapsing. He puts a hand on a nearby tree to steady himself.*

""The... entire city... it's gone.""

---

*According to paladin records of the battle, there were no escapees, and the entire population of the city was either killed or captured, and most of the records or artifacts within burned or confiscated.*

*but then, shortly after that report was written, the rumors began, entire companies of soldiers vanishing. Not a trace.*

 My recent article on DarkReading, if you have a hybrid workforce of even one, and are not considering the home environment, you need to, starting yesterday.

 This is a major problem in modern hybrid workforce, poorly managed if managed at all, home networks. Theses are often combinations of whatever IOT trinket was cheapest at amazon, which also represents a HUGE percentage of botnets...

* BASHLITE - Millions of systems, 2016 - present - 96% IoT, 4% home routers.
* Eleven11bot - 80k–86k systems, 2025 to Present -100% Security cameras.
* NVRsVo1d - 1.6 million systems, 2025 to Present - 100% Android TV boxes.

So how does this differ from any hotel, coffee shop, or public WIFI? 

# Persistence!

  In none of those others does a would-be attacker have on average half a day for months to even years to work on breaking into a single system, they can, have, and WILL continue to sit on that until the next 0 day of significance gives them the leverage to succeed. 

How do you solve? 

 VPN is NOT enough, that controls what can bee seen from A->B, but if not split tunneled and always on, this protection only protects business traffic NOT systems, and does nothing to protect them when not on or split tunneled. As well if the compromised device is a router or capable or altering traffic, it MAY even catch your full tunnel as well. 



 A real solution will be small firewalls under business management to isolate the system from its environment, the firewall lives on the home network; the system, behind it. If they need to be mobile, FW with AP, and managed access so they cannot say ""I'll put this TV on the work router because it has better signal..."" This has the added benefit of detecting these sorts of threats, and the env they are coming from, ans STILL cost less than a breach.

Other methods can be cellular access (built in sim or hotspot) as those are CGN and do not allow peer access from the provider side.

The threat is more real than most people dream if they consider it at all...

My middle sister, ""Libby,"" lives on another continent and visits home once a year. For the fourth time in a row, she and her boyfriend are staying with our youngest sister, ""Jill,"" even though I've repeatedly invited them to stay with me (everyone on this story is between 25 and 35). They arrived yesterday, and I haven't seen them yet.

It makes me so sad, and I'm trying to understand why. I'm almost certain the reason is my personality or my boyfriend's.

All of my interactions with my sisters are exclusively positive, supportive, and loving. Many jokes, some deep conversations, no drama. I don't think Libby and Jill interact with each other more than I do with either of them. There was some slight tension when they both went no-contact with our parents for a while (this is no longer the case). We all agree that lots of messed up stuff happened in our childhood, but I stayed in touch with our parents, albeit with some hard boundaries. I don't pressure my sisters to change their approach, and I don't relay messages from our parents when they're NC.

Our living situations are very similar—we both have apartments in the same area with similar pets and no guest room. If anything, my place is a bit nicer (outside space, no smoking, more nature - all things Libby appreciates). I guess I'm probably more serious and ""intense"" than Jill is, though I'm a patient and good host.

My boyfriend is very kind, but he's autistic and can have meltdowns sometimes. Years ago, Libby told me she felt my relationship wasn't good for me. Is that the problem? But I love my complicated dude, and I'm taking care of myself. I'm not being hurt, though some of my boyfriend's behavior is immature and he doesn't have a good filter for what he says. We have some bad patterns in our communication, but our partnership is balanced and he makes me feel safe. Libby seems to like talking to him. And Jill has some similar communication issues in her relationship, too. Neither of us would fight in front of houseguests (or anyone).

It's true that having visitors might stress us out more, and maybe Libby can just tell. But I can't help but think they're judging us or that Libby just doesn't like me as much as Jill. It really, really hurts. Last time they visited, they couldn't make time for coffee at our place, and it feels like they only want to see us with other people around or for outings. What's going on?

I'd always believed my husband Aiden and I, were an unbreakable couple, until that night, I've discovered he's having an affair.
“You slept with her?” I didn't ask him, my eyes fell behind him.
The pretty new neighbor slid out of the room, wearing Aiden's T-shirt and her hair was messy. Her eyes drop to the floor and she scurries to the bathroom.
“Abby ...” Aiden's head drops down. ""This was an accident.""
I clenched my fingers, my nails digging into my palm, yet I felt no pain.
No wonder he keeps showing up at neighbors' houses, helping fix things.
I thought our marriage was perfect, but it turned out to be a lie.
I pull away and hold in the tears. “Okay. Have a nice life, you and her.”
There's no way I can win back someone who doesn't love me at all.
————————

Abby
I roll over and eye the glowing face of the digital clock on my bedside table. It reads 4:30am. Dang it. I have to get up in an hour for work but know that I'll never fall back to sleep with that kind of pressure. I sigh and try to settle onto my back but am jarred by a kick to my hip. A little kick from a little foot. Knowingly, I reach behind me and take hold of a leg and ease it back. Looking, I see Ava blissfully asleep between Aiden and I. Again. Her blonde hair is mussed around her face, her thumb screwed securely in her rosebud mouth, her Dora pajamas hiked up around her torso.
More nights than not she ends up here, cuddled between her daddy and I. Sometimes it was nice having my whole family in our big bed together. This morning it is a nuisance because what I want to do is slide over and cuddle with my husband without obstacle.
No dice.
I ease out of bed, trying not to wake them. The fan I have for it's white noise whirs soothingly. I tuck the blanket around Ava's peaceful form and glance at Aiden. He sleeps like the dead, flat on his back, one arm tossed over his head, lips a little parted, boxers and no shirt. I watch the easy rise and fall of his chest in the glow of the LED clock. Just enough chest hair. I smile to myself. He is a blatantly handsome man with lots of dark, wavy hair, not long but still managing to be unruly, and ice blue eyes. A wicked smile, a quick laugh, a mischievous sense of humor. Plus, he is an outstanding father. He could build forts and glue construction paper and wipe Ava's little butt all day, yet still bring me to my knees with one pecking when I get home at night.
Lucky girl, me.
I pad around the enormous bed, get my robe blindly from the hook on the back of our bathroom door, and tiptoe out of the room. I shut the door behind me with a soft click. Snowy, our white fat cat appears at the top of the stairs and meows, doing a quick figure-8 around my ankles, then races ahead of me down the steps. I follow, heading for the kitchen and my first cup of coffee. I let her out of the back door onto the patio and she bounds off into the darkness. After starting the coffee maker, I wander through the house's first floor absentmindedly straightening up the magazines on the coffee table, the Duplo Legos on the hearth. The fireplace is a nod to the North, where we're from. It works, but here in Florida, it doesn't get much use. In Pittsburgh, we used the fireplace all the time. When I got the job I have now and Aiden and I moved South with newborn Ava in tow, we specifically searched for a house that reminded us of home: two stories, a big kitchen, a front porch, a fireplace. It was hard to find one that fit the bill. The development we finally moved into has this type of house and thought the yard is negligible, there is a pool- a serious luxury for us Northerners. We were sold.
A wash of headlights across the windows of the living room at the front of the house catches my eye. I peek between the vertical blinds- the same kind that seem to be in every house I've ever seen down here- and look onto the street. Across the street, a moving van slowly pulls into the driveway. I watch then as two men hop out and address a woman who stands next to a sporty silver car. She speaks to them briefly, then dangles a bunch of keys in front of them. They follow her to the garage door, which she lifts after unlocking it.
I hope it's a family with a child Ava's age. 
Ava is four. Aiden and I have been married for ten years.
I sit heavily at the wood block kitchen table. I want another baby. I want to give Aiden another child, Ava a brother or sister to share her secrets with. And it looks like it just isn't going to happen for any of us.
My eyes dart to the clock on the microwave and I see it's close enough to 5:30 that I can go get ready for work. I down the last of my sweet coffee and head back upstairs. I sneak into the bedroom, paw in the dark for my uniform hanging in the closet, and turn to look at my little family as my eyes adjust. Ava has scooted her back against Aiden, who is now on his side with a protective arm around her little form. I smile. I may not get everything I want. But I have this- this little girl and this doting man. It is beyond all I need.
......
When I get home that evening I let myself in and am surprised by the silence that greets me. I am usually met by a chorus of ""mommy, mommy, mommy!"" the minute I step over the threshold. I listen for movement as I dump the mail and my bag on the small table near the front door. I walk back by the kitchen and look into the pool area but it's deserted, a lone beach ball floating on the surface of the water.
Curious.
I look for a note on the wipe-off board we have on the side of the fridge and there it is. ""Went across the street to help new neighbor"" is written in Aiden's impossibly proper block lettering.
I am tired. I am really not in the mood to meet this new family today but remembering that I was hopeful to get a friend out of the deal, I take out a pan of frozen homemade lasagna I had made last week and head back out the front door after discarding my lab coat.
The house across the street is single story, painted an olive green with white trim to our periwinkle blue. These homes are concrete block to stave off hurricane force winds, but have siding that looks like wood for a Victorian feel. I hadn't really known the last owner so had never been in this house and didn't know anyone with this particular floor plan. I was interested to get a peek at it.
I pick across the driveway, strewn with boxes and padding blankets, and bypass the open garage door for the front one, plain and painted red. There is a small entrance but no wide porch like ours. I ring the bell. From inside, I can hear my own daughter's distinctive voice call out, ""Door!"" and it makes me smile. After a moment, the door swings open and I am greeted by a pretty ebony haired woman. She's a head shorter than I, with green eyes, wearing a tank top smudged with dirt and rolled up denim shorts.
""Can I help you?"" she smiles at me. I hold out my free hand.
""I'm Abby Dempsey. I live across the street. Welcome."" I present her with the lasagna. She accepts it with a wide grin.
""Oh! Thank you so much! I'm Chloe Franklin. Please come in. I believe some people you know are here."" She leads me inside and down a tiled hall to the great room at the back of the house. Here, I find my husband in a plain white tshirt fooling with the wiring of electronics.
""Mommy!"" Ava cries happily, jumping up from a pile of Tupperware on the kitchen floor and barreling at me. I swoop her up and plant peckings on both pink cheeks. At Ava's outburst, Aiden looks up and cracks a smile that shows off his stupidly perfect teeth. Never any braces, either. Or whitening treatments. It also shows his dimples. For God's sake. I never should have married a man more beautiful than I am.
""Hey!"" he greets, standing and brushing his hands on his jeans. He walks over and pecks me quickly. ""So, you met Chloe."" He motions to the new homeowner who is putting the pan I have handed her into the freezer. She returns to where we stand.
""Yes,"" I nod, smiling at our new neighbor.
""I'm sorry I stole your husband. I was having a time of it trying to get the bed set up on my own. I spotted him with this little beauty-"" she touches Ava's nose- ""out front. He was kind enough to help and then offered to look at that mess."" She motions to the wall unit where the sound system and television sit. I laugh a little.
""Yes, well, he IS good with that sort of thing."" Aiden moves away and goes back to what he was doing.
""I'm actually about done here,"" he says. I look at my watch. It's nearly six and I'm hungry.
""Well, Chloe, it's so nice to meet you but I need to get Ava home for dinner. I hope if you need anything at all, you'll let us know.""
""Thank you so much again. Between your husband's help and dinner you all have made me feel so welcome already. I just know I'm going to love it here.""
""I'll be home in just a minute,"" Aiden calls as Chloe sees me out. I say goodbye and cart Ava home while she happily shatters about her day.
""No kids over there to play with, huh, munchkin?"" I ask, setting her free on the porch of our house.
""No kids. Just that lady,"" Ava replies. I glance over my shoulder at the house again and shrug. So much for all of us getting the neighbors of our dreams. But Chloe seems friendly enough. Maybe at least I'd get my new friend.
.....
I did become friends with the new neighbor. She showed up on our doorstep every now and then with questions easily answered: closest movie theater, best local doctor, the number of a good lawn service. I work a lot during the week so she'd often have to ask Aiden these questions and they became friendly as well. Ava seems to take to her, calling out a hello whenever we see Chloe as we come and go. She is quirky and witty, something I am definitely not. We find out she is single, no kids, a photographer that works things like weddings and those portraits families do at the beach, everyone in jeans and white shirts, barefoot. She was gone most weekend evenings and when I asked her to show me a sample of her work she directs me to her website, which is, indeed, full of fantastic shots. Really beautiful work.
So that's how, on a balmy evening in June when the light is just right, Aiden, Ava, and I end up on the local beach, Aiden and I in, you guessed it, matching faded jeans and white oxfords and Ava in a white dress with a full skirt. Chloe takes so many pictures and has us in so many poses I really think it's overkill. But when she comes by to show us the proofs, I end up all choked up. It is nearly impossible to choose just one. The one of us where Aiden leans on his right hand, one knee up, me sitting in front of his hip, Ava in my lap all sincerely smiling? Or the one where Ava and I are both looking up at him as he gazes down at us? Or the one where we are all laughing, Ava's head thrown back in glee? Or even the one of our backs, Ava between us holding our hands, our feet in the surf?
Of course, I get prints of everything but the one I choose to blow up and hang over the couch in a beautiful frame is the one of Aiden looking down at us. I think it captures so much about us as a family. We are adoring and adored. And nothing matches the expression on Aiden's face when he's looking at us. It is love. Chloe did a wonderful job capturing it.
So maybe one night a week we hung out. Sometimes we'd have her over on a Sunday night for burgers off the grill, other times she'd cook when I worked all day and I'd come home to find my family at her house playing Jenga and waiting for me.
She is lonely, I think. She doens't seem to have a lot going on socially. Most nights during the week her car is in the drive and the lights in her house are out if she isn't at work. And we enjoy her. She has a quick laugh and has no problem getting on the floor and playing with Ava and her Barbies...the Aunt she never had.
After she'd been living there about two and a half months, she knocks on our door just as I am tucking in Ava for the night. I hear her voice from upstairs, a little on edge, and Aiden's baritone full of concern. I can't make out words so I finish smooching my baby and go down.
I find Aiden and Chloe in an embrace standing in the middle of the kitchen and an alarm sounds in my head. It is completely unnatural for me to see his arms around another woman, friend or no.",1,1756225182.0,Novels,0,1.0,False

this made me spiral into this whole existential crisis about how much of this is just normal human brain farts vs me literally running my mental browser with 100 tabs open at all times. ive noticed this shit happens most on days when ive been glued to my laptop for hours trying to catch up on work while simultaneously listening to podcasts and checking my phone every 30 seconds like some kind of digital crackhead. do you guys have these moments too where your brain just... buffers?? like it takes 10 seconds to load a simple thought?? i honestly cant tell if this is just the human condition in 2025 or if i should be genuinely worried about my cognitive function lmaooo. also PLEASE tell me your funniest ""why did i walk into this room"" moments because i need to know im not alone in this chaos",131,1756225163.0,CasualConversation,25,0.92,False

The first thing cashing resentment is that i still have to pay for every single meal, every single event, every date, every tip, every coffee run, every vacation, every snack, every movie, etc etc etc.  Her view, which to be fair has remained consistent, is that the man needs to “provide” and “court” the woman.  Fine, i accepted that.  But she hasn’t done anything that you’d expect the woman to do in that traditional sense.  She claims that because we are dating i have to do the courting, and once we are married, her womanly traditional role begins.  I guess i signed up for this? But i can’t help the growing resentment. She never even reaches for her wallet, and it’s just an expected thing.  Like it’s not really super appreciated.  Yeah she says thank you (most of the time) but it just feels like it’s expected.

Secondly I feel as though the give and take ratio in the relationship is way off.  I don’t ever expect 50/50, that’s a recipe for disaster.  But i feel like often it’s in the 80/20 range.  and when i do get my way, i have to deal with attitude and passive aggressiveness from her.   She does not take “no” very well.  I just feel like I am very easy going and am willing to give up some stuff and do things i dont want to do to make her happy, whereas she’s not willing to do anything that i want to do if it inconveniences her.  

Also, she just does not treat me like a loving girlfriend.  She often expects me to post pics of us together on social media and stuff like that.  But she has never once posted a picture of me.  Not one time.  And i know what you’re thinking, but no, she’s not cheating.  That’s one thing i know for sure.  But i really just don’t understand it.  Is she embarrassed by me or something?

I feel bad in a sense, because she was raised to always get her way.  And as an adult that has had some serious consequences.   But she is a very sweet, smart, caring person and i do love her.  I do want to be with her.  I just can’t really put up with this anymore and i don’t know how to handle it.

Like, i could say i need these things to change and she’d probably just call my bluff.  I’m not really sure what to say or do ",6,1756225088.0,relationship_advice,31,1.0,False
