1k8ve1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1k8ve1e/ex_broke_up_out_of_the_blue/,Ex broke up out of the blue,"Hey y‚Äôall. Just wanted to share my story here.

1.5 months ago my gf of almost 3 years broke up out of nowhere. We were about to/in the middle of moving, having to pick up the keys for the new place just 3 days later.
She told me that ‚Äúwe‚Äôve tried‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre too different‚Äù etc. I didn‚Äôt really understand anything, I just felt so confused. She came over the next day to talk, but it was merely the same things. I then asked her after she left over the text, if there was someone else.

And there was. She met him 4 days prior on a night out with friends and went on a coffee date with him behind my back - told me she had grown fond (more than fond) of him. Basically stating her reasons to leave as the ones she mentioned, but also because she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want to get to know him behind my back‚Äù (bs you already were).

From here on she put me on hold for 5 days before having a ‚Äútalk‚Äù (it really was just me wanting clarification) and started acting cold, passive aggressive and just handled the break immaturely, tried justifying her actions and got really defensive. I never got a real talk to come out with my emotions etc.
Looking back on it, there was ‚Äòsome truth‚Äô to her explanations, but overall they were just surface level shitty excuses and she fled the mess she made.

The days and weeks prior to her going out, nothing indicated her decision. She was really invested in the move, made a detailed floor plan, went on the lookout for furniture and was excited when we started contacting moving companies - now she could feel progress being made. She even bought me flowers and wrote a card for me 1.5 weeks before breaking up where I was the best boyfriend in the world, how much she appreciated me, that she loved me and how excited she was to start a new chapter with moving into our first permanent home. I had taken care of her the weeks prior, because she had been sick, and overall had just really stepped up as a partner the last months, acknowledging her, praising her, taking responsibility. Basically, the total opposite of her decision was being communicated both with gestures, but also in small everyday interactions. I feel blindsided. Days and weeks before we would still have intimacy with hugs, her sitting on my lap, kissing, holding hands etc. 

And then one night someone sparked something in her, and now she wanted to pursue that - throw our bond and the process in the trash for a stranger. She flipped on me and ditched the future plans she had just expressed. Really baffles me, that it comes from HER, as she expressed the importance of empathy and understanding others and seeing things from their perspective. So in a matter of 4 days she killed everything, did not think about how I‚Äôd feel, did it from an emotionally vulnerable place and without any real consequential thinking - she has ADHD(ADD) and I suspect that having played a role in her, what seems like a total hasty, irrational decision imo. She does have a tendency to fall for people very fast and commit too soon - even before getting to know the person.

Sure, there were issues at hand that we were working on like communication, but I never got the impression, that it was anything major. We always resolved those issues (apparently not). I actively showed change for her, but she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want to wait‚Äù (crappy excuse). She definitely bottled up some things that led her to do what she did - not that it‚Äôs an excuse to emotionally cheat on me.

Feel free to share what you think <3

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/k5xbOJP8Sm): **February 24, 2025**

I (32F) and my husband (38M) have been married for 3 years, our relationship has had its ups and downs but we're a relatively happy couple. Though, in the beginning of our relationship, he was also dating Angela (24F) 5 years ago, l was unaware of this other relationship but when I found out, I confronted him and he told me that since we weren't officially dating that he didn't know we were exclusive. I told him that if he didn't cut off this relationship with Angela, that I was going to break it off.

We left it at that and we didn't talk for a while when he came to my apartment unexpectedly weeks later saying it was over with Angela and that he wanted to try again and asked me to be his girlfriend. Ever since then we have been a pretty normal couple, we have our moments but our relationship is going good and I believe he is my soulmate.

Recently there's been an issue in our relationship though, Angela.

3 weeks ago, we were out running errands and went to a small boba shop that just opened up next to our local grocery store, as we were off to the side looking at the menu, from the corner of my eye I see a woman that looks similar to Angela walk in, I do a double take and sure enough it's her. I feel an intense amount of dread and hope that hubby doesn't see her.

As I'm internally panicking, I hear a woman's voice call for my husband. And as you might have guessed, it was Angela. My husband turns around and they have a small but awkward conversation, the whole time I just disassociate and stare off to the distance until she asks my husband ‚Äúis that your wife?"" To which he just nods and holds my hand.

I pretty much just awkwardly smile and prayed this encounter would end the whole time, eventually she gets in line and we wait behind her, I felt so embarrassed, I immediately got out drinks and leave. That was that, until 2 weeks ago when I saw my husband's phone light up to a Facebook messenger notification, I asked him who it was from as he never uses messenger.

He said it was from an old friend, I asked who and he said I wouldn't know. I became suspicious but wasn't necessarily worried because I just assumed it was a friend. Until a few days later when he got another Facebook messenger notification while I was ordering food off his phone, it was from Angela, I was shocked and confused, I went to their messages and everything seemed friendly and casual, though because of their history, I felt very uncomfortable with them talking.

I went up to him and confronted him about the texts and asked why she was texting him, he told me that after running into her she friended him on Facebook and they began talking, he assured me it was all casual but I still told him I didn't want him talking to her. He assured me he would stop, I told him to unfriend her to which he hesitated to but eventually did.

There was no issue or word from Angela until last night, to which from my knowledge she spammed messaged my husband, and even called him crying telling him that her mother was sick, I guess he knew her mother and felt sympathy towards her, Angela vented to him about how she had no one and she just needed someone to comfort her, she asked my husband if he could come and be there for her to which he said yes, I had no idea he was doina this until I saw him putting his shoes on near the door, I asked him where he was going and he told me the story of Angela's mom and that she needed someone to be with her. I told him to not go, and we had a small argument, he was rushing out the door, so I blocked him in and said that if he was going to go see and comfort his ex girlfriend, that he wasn't allowed back in. He scoffed and pushed past me, I watched as he left, I went back inside, poured a few drinks while i tried my hardest to not cry and blow up his phone.

Eventually, 3 hours passed and he came back home, I sat on the couch during this and as he came in I told him that he wasn't allowed to sleep here, he was shocked, and we got into another argument and to cut it short. He told me he had no where to go so I told him that maybe he should go to Angela as they seem to help each other a lot, he then left again and I haven't heard anything from him, l'm currently staying up and have had a few drinks, I decided to post this on Reddit as I feel like I might have overreacted and been an ahole, I just need advice on how to handle this whole situation as I'm barely able to process what to do. I'm sorry if this was long, I needed to vent.

**EDIT:** Hi everyone, goodness so many of you, thank you everyone for commenting and your support. I‚Äôm going to respond to some comments right now.

**Small update:** I eventually went to sleep and sent a text that I was sick and wasn‚Äôt coming into work today. It‚Äôs currently 2pm where I live and I‚Äôve just been napping and kind of out of it, I haven‚Äôt heard from him at all and he hasn‚Äôt came back home. I‚Äôm kind of worried as I don‚Äôt know where he‚Äôs at, his location has been off since yesterday. I might send him a text later to make sure he‚Äôs okay, I don‚Äôt know if this is a good idea as I‚Äôm not in the best mindset right now and have been in zombie mode. As of now, I‚Äôm trying to process what even happened as it went by so fast. I‚Äôll keep you all updated if anything happens. Thank you all again.

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** NTA. Girl, he really pulled the ‚Äúshe has no one else‚Äù card like that‚Äôs YOUR problem?? That‚Äôs an ex, not a charity case. The fact that he hesitated to unfriend her in the first place was already suspect, but running to her the second she calls? In the middle of the night?? Nah. You didn‚Äôt overreact you just set a boundary, and he sprinted right past it like it was the finish line of a marathon. Stay strong, because he‚Äôs acting real comfortable disrespecting you.

> **OOP:** Thank you for your reassurance, I want to confide in some friends and family but I feel like they‚Äôd make me feel invalidated. I do feel bad for the girl if her mother is sick, but I‚Äôm upset that my husband was willing to go, I don‚Äôt know the full details of the situation with her, as my husband was rushing, so I don‚Äôt know if she has friends or any other family but I assume she does so I don‚Äôt understand why she went to my husband for comfort.

**What does OOP know about Angela when she discovered the fact of her husband dating her at the time?**

> **OOP:** I honestly did not know much about this girl, I only knew he was dating her because he got tagged on an Instagram post of them together 5 years ago. I went on her account and there was nothing about age, I didn‚Äôt fully stalk her but I did do enough to see that they were dating and to remember her face. Eventually that‚Äôs when the confrontation happened, I never asked about her and I tried my hardest to not go look at her account, I have self esteem issues and I didn‚Äôt want to compare myself. It wasn‚Äôt until around when we were engaged, I decided to ask him about the whole Angela situation, and that‚Äôs when I found out about her age, supposedly the way they met was that she went to his job and strikes up a conversation with him, she asked to go on a date, she lied to him and said she worked at the company and said she was 23. They went on dates and after 2 months she confessed her real age and that she didn‚Äôt actually work there, she was 19 turning 20 and that she had actually found him by going on apps like LinkedIn to find guys with higher paying jobs.

**Commenter 2:** NTA. You married a good man, but, he was playing both of you at the beginning. Not a good start. I would normally say you are being controlling but this is an EX, not just a female friend, so, no. She should be talking to family or an ex that isn't married.

> **OOP:** Thank you, and possibly, I haven‚Äôt thought much about our past as its best to not think about things you can‚Äôt go back and change but I‚Äôm slowly processing that might‚Äôve been the case. I personally don‚Äôt find myself too controlling, some in the comments seem to think I am but this was at night and he was meeting her at her home, shes also an ex, and not just an ex but a girl he was with the same time I was with him.

&nbsp;

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/f1VknABvWE): **March 4, 2025 (eight days later)**

Hi everyone, it‚Äôs been 8 days since I posted my original post, and I finally have an update for you all. I‚Äôm sorry it took long but I‚Äôve been sick. This is going to be long so I apologize as I have to address a few things.

I want to first say thank you to those that gave helpful and supportive comments, and to those that said I drove my husband straight to another woman‚Äôs arms or I was hostile and controlling, first, if my husband was willing to go to another woman when in a argument with his WIFE, then is he really MY husband? I mean I have some standards to not marry an awful person.

Second, to those that said I was controlling and hostile towards Angela, if you have a partner and are okay with them doing something like this then that‚Äôs something within your boundaries, not mine. I don‚Äôt like having contact with exes or having my husband be in contact with his exes.

Finally the age gap, I explained the story of how they met and such on a comment but to sum it up, she had originally lied about her age, I didn‚Äôt know her age or anything about her until I was engaged.

Okay on to what happened, he eventually came home later than day, I was watching TV on the couch when he walked in, we looked at each other and didn‚Äôt say anything. He went to our room, took a shower and fell asleep.

I was still upset with him so I avoided going to check up on him or even talk to him so I waited in the living room/kitchen until a few hours later when he woke up. I decided to make dinner, he came out, sat on the couch and we ate in silence before he asked if I wanted to talk, I said I did and he explained what happened.

From what he told me, when we saw her at the boba shop, she had friended him on Facebook later that day, he didn‚Äôt friend her back though and ignored it, and eventually a few days later she sent him a message request.

This is when he handed me his phone to see the messages, to sum it up, she texted him a few times over a range of days without an answer, from pleasantries, updates about her life and finally a suicidal message.

Now I don‚Äôt know what is allowed to be said in this subreddit but my husband did respond out of worry for another person, or so he claimed. They talked a lot about her addictions, self harm and other very personal things relating to that, through reading I did find out she had a boyfriend, and that he was actually 51 years old.

My husband calmed her down and they stopped talking for a few days, when she reached out again and the same thing happened. This repeated again, where he wouldn‚Äôt respond until she guilted him to. When I had found out and told him to block her, he actually didn‚Äôt block her out of fear, but he didn‚Äôt respond to her messages until that night.

She actually sent very concerning messages beforehand and called him on messenger, he answered and he said that she was wailing and screaming in pain, now I don‚Äôt want to say too much but she had told him she attempted by taking a bunch of pills because of her mother which is why he rushed to her.

When he got there, he told me she was acting strangely and almost pretending to have done what she did. He tried to get her to the hospital to which she refused, after pleading for a while, he was getting ready to call 911 when she confessed she didn‚Äôt actually take any pills, he was confused and asked why she said she did.

She couldn‚Äôt give him a clear answer, my husband was going to leave when she begged him to let her explain again, she said her mom is the only person who cares about her, and that she needed somebody with her after she found out she was sick and that she had no one but my husband and my husband wouldn‚Äôt come otherwise if it wasn‚Äôt urgent. my husband wasn‚Äôt buying it so he asked if her mom was even sick to which she denied it but seemed to be lying. My husband then left.

He told me he just stayed in his car for a while before coming back home and that‚Äôs when the confrontation happened, he said he was very tired and felt horrible so he wasn‚Äôt in the right headspace to explain right then and there.

He also told me he didn‚Äôt go back to Angela‚Äôs but instead just stayed in his car, got food and pretty much wandered town until he got home later that day.

After this, I felt very overwhelmed, I usually like to take time to myself to process things before making a decision or response, so I told him I needed time. I didn‚Äôt interact with him until the next morning and told him I needed more time before talking to him again and was going to stay with my parents for a few day.

And now we‚Äôre here, a few days actually turned into a week because as soon as I got here, I got sick. So I haven‚Äôt felt good enough to even drive back home, much less process or think much. I secretly don‚Äôt even know how or what to do, like how do we just go back to normal? I still feel betrayed and even though he didn‚Äôt cheat, I don‚Äôt trust him, and I don‚Äôt even know if he‚Äôs telling the truth. I mean divorce is extreme for something so minor, but I don‚Äôt know. I have to go back home tomorrow as I feel a bit better and I can‚Äôt hide out here forever and I have responsibilities, even though it‚Äôs been a nice escape and being with my family has been great. I haven‚Äôt talked much to my husband except through texts so tomorrow will be our first face-to-face conversation in a week.

So that‚Äôs the update, what actually reminded me to do this update was I got a random message request on Instagram a few hours ago from a burner account, its a picture and I‚Äôm kind of scared to open it, I know it‚Äôs probably a scam thing, but something in my gut is telling me it‚Äôs connected to Angela and I don‚Äôt know if I should open it.

Update: so I opened the picture, it was a screenshot from what I assume is Angela‚Äôs private story of her in lingerie with a caption that says ‚Äúshe‚Äôll just have to taste me, when she‚Äôs kissing him.‚Äù

[TL;DR] Husband came back home, Angela faked suicide and her mom might not even be sick. I went to my parents house, have been staying here for a week and haven‚Äôt talked to husband, going back home tomorrow.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Well, the good news is that you're not the only one who's been feeling sick lately. The bad news is that it's not just physical, it's also emotional after reading this update. Hang in there, OP.

> **OOP:** Yes sadly, curse you germs! But I feel like emotionally, I‚Äôve been struggling a lot as I don‚Äôt really know what to do or how to process this, I want to go to my husband and ask for his help like always but I know I can‚Äôt. Especially if I can‚Äôt even trust his word and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll even have my husband soon. I‚Äôm very lost. I‚Äôm dreading going back home and facing the music.

**Commenter 2:** Send him the picture and ask what that's all about

> **OOP:** I saved the photo and I‚Äôm planning on doing so later tonight, I‚Äôm very anxious when it comes to this kind of stuff so I‚Äôm trying to calm my nerves first.

**Commenter 3:** ""he eventually came home later than day, I was watching TV on the couch when he walked in, we looked at each other and didn‚Äôt say anything. He went to our room, took a shower and fell asleep""

Is it normal for him to walk in the house and take a shower in the early afternoon'ish (a guess based on your timeline)?

> **OOP:** No it isn‚Äôt, he usually showers at night but he hadn‚Äôt the night prior so I just assume he showered because of that.

#----NEW UPDATE----

**Trigger Warnings:** >!infidelity, job loss, verbal abuse!<

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/JlHJ667dfG): **April 20, 2025 (1.5 months later)

Hi everyone, it‚Äôs been a while and I know an update has been overdue and I feel like I can finally now give you guys one. It‚Äôs been a few weeks and a lot of stressful things have happened so I apologize for not updating sooner. I finally have a minute to update and I‚Äôm going to try to summarize events as a lot has happened so I‚Äôm sorry if details seem to be missing.

When I went back home, my husband wasn‚Äôt there (he was at work) I contemplated a ton and was very nervous to confront him as I dislike confrontation and what comes out of it, I was also sick and feeling weak so I just decided to go to sleep, and confront him the next morning, the next morning came and we did talk. At first it was awkward small talk over breakfast, he was being extra sweet though since he bought me coffee before I woke up, it was nice.

I didn‚Äôt want to make a huge deal out of it so I just mentioned the picture, he was somehow offended and asked to see it. I showed him and he said something like ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs just song lyrics and means nothing‚Äù we went back and forth on this, don‚Äôt fully remember what was said but ultimately I just let it go.

I went back to work the next day, and for the next few days me and him would argue about Angela almost everyday, the only times we didn‚Äôt argue is when we would ignore each other which was done 90% of the time. I know this was childish of us to do but I was mad at him and just didn‚Äôt feel ready to try and repair things, getting a divorce or separating also felt extreme at the time as I had no evidence of him cheating, and it was just a theory.

Work was honestly like an escape as I had my friends/coworkers there and was able to just be away. for reference I worked at a small independently owned office as a receptionist, I‚Äôve worked there for 5 years and it was my favorite job, our boss was great, pay was good, I had friends there and benefits were amazing and despite occasionally being yelled at over the phone, It was honestly the best job I‚Äôve ever worked at. Then randomly at work we started to get prank calls, now it‚Äôs not totally unusual but these ones would happen everyday, it would usually be someone just screaming and then hanging up. We were instructed to wait for the other person to speak first during this.

After a few days these prank calls did stop but we kept getting calls from different people asking to talk to our boss, which was odd because rarely would we get this request, this happened multiple times a day for a few days. My boss usually sends these calls to voice mail as he‚Äôs busy so few days later I‚Äôm about to leave when he asks if I can stay for a bit and talk to him in his office. I did and this is where he showed me the voice mails and asked if I knew these people, they were all complaints about me. I didn‚Äôt recognize any of the voices so I said no. My boss assumed these weren‚Äôt real but to try and find out who these people might be, because of this when someone would call and ask to talk to our boss we had to ask for a phone number and name. Some would provide it, some wouldn‚Äôt.

Eventually this would happen every single hour and again all complaints about me, my boss decided to just send me home for a few days to see if the calls would end which they didn‚Äôt. A few days turned into a week and then I got a call and was fired.

From what my coworkers told me the calls continued and my boss was just sick of it as he would have to call back each time and decided it was just easier to fire me. I suspect this was Angela and her friends doing this to try to get me fired and they succeeded.

During the week I was home, it was driving me crazy as sometimes I would have to be home with my husband and all I wanted to do was just argue, though no issues until I caught him stalking Angela‚Äôs Instagram, he would sleep on the couch and I would sleep in the room, I caught him when I saw him on his phone from the hallway.

I honestly was just tired from it all so I did blow up at him, his excuse was he just wanted to check up on her. When I told him I was fired and that I suspected it was Angela he basically called me crazy and said she would never do anything like that.

I was so drained that I didn‚Äôt even argue, in fact I didn‚Äôt even talk to him anymore, which is probably why he felt it was okay to come home late one night, drunk with faded lipstick on and glitter, we had another argument and he left. He didn‚Äôt come back for days and sent flowers and my favorite food to me with a note that said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I love you.‚Äù

He came home later that day and he looked pretty distraught and wanted to explain, I let him. His reasoning was that he felt awful about how our relationship was and needed to de-stress from it, he went out with a few friends for drinks and some girl kissed him and was dancing up on him, he said he rejected her immediately and felt disgusted. I don‚Äôt know if I believe that still. I asked about Angela and if he was still talking to her to which he said no but she did reach out a few times and he did see her once.

I asked if they ever slept with each other and he said no but she kissed him and he rejected her. I asked a whole bunch of other questions about our relationship and some of the answers did hurt. I told him I wanted to separate just for a little bit, he broke down crying and begged me not to leave him, I apologized and packed most of my things as he was on his knees next to me apologizing.

I ignored him and left. For the last 2 weeks I‚Äôve been at my parents house, I finally told them what happened and they despise him. He‚Äôs been up here almost daily trying to talk to me and my parents refuse to let him see me (my parents live in the next town over).He‚Äôs sent me food, flowers, gift cards, literally anything you can DoorDash, he‚Äôs sent. I‚Äôve gotten spam calls and messages from him, and I‚Äôve blocked him. Yet he‚Äôs gotten his family and some of my distant relatives to do the same.

Honestly I‚Äôm tired of him and have begged him to stop trying to contact me, obviously hasn‚Äôt worked much. For my next moves I am thinking of divorce but I‚Äôm just not ready yet, none of this feels real, I just need to take time and heal a little before making that decision, I have a feeling divorce is going to be hard so I just can‚Äôt handle that yet or another option is therapy and try to reconcile. I‚Äôm currently trying to find a job in my parents town, and I plan to stay here for a while until I‚Äôm able to move on fully. Also I know I didn‚Äôt talk about her much but as for Angela I have no idea if he‚Äôs talking to her still or anything about her and I want to keep it that way. I don‚Äôt think there is going to be another update since our relationship is pretty much over, thank you to those who checked up on me and commented advice I‚Äôm forever grateful.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** With all this drama and mental anguish and if you don't have kids, divorce sounds like the best thing for you. The trust is broken and it will truly never be back.

**Commenter 2:** You're better off without him and his crazy ex girlfriend, OP. Ask your boss if you can't get a list of the numbers that called in and left messages about you. You'll likely be able to trace them back to Angela. Explain to him you were being stalked. You may have a case for wrongful termination and I highly suggest you talk to a lawyer/file a police report about what she did. 

**Commenter 3:** OP. GO TO A LAWYER. The time to develop self respect was months ago but you can start now. Don't talk to him. Don't respond. Document everything and make it very clear you aren't coming back

**Commenter 4:** Honestly OP, leave him. If he stalking her page, he talking to her or wants to. You got fired from your job and it sounds like he doesn't care at all. 5 years is a long ass time. I wouldn't dare deal with a man like that disrespects you. You literally told him no multiple times and still saw her. Do yourself a favor and leave. You will be happier. Best of luck OP

I‚Äôm still trying to wrap my head around everything, but I know I messed up.

We‚Äôve been roommates for the past year. She‚Äôs always been there for me, and I‚Äôve always admired how hard she works. After her breakup, she dove into her career, getting her cosmetology license and building up a client base. She‚Äôs the type of person who gives everything to others and never asks for anything in return.

Meanwhile, I‚Äôve been struggling. I barely scraped by in college, and I didn‚Äôt know what I wanted to do with my life. I was supposed to go to law school, but I got rejected from every school except one. Then the school rescinded my acceptance because of some drama with people I used to be friends with. I didn‚Äôt know how to tell her. She had already helped me with so much, even paying for part of my college expenses, and I didn‚Äôt want her to see me as a complete failure. So I lied. I told her I still had a job lined up at a government agency ‚Äî something classified. She was proud of me.

I should‚Äôve come clean. Instead, I leaned into the lie. Every day, I‚Äôd leave the house early, hang out in coffee shops, apply for jobs half-heartedly, and then come home pretending like I‚Äôd been working. She never questioned me. She just worked hard and did everything she could to support us both, covering our living expenses while I did nothing but pretend.

In my mind, I wasn‚Äôt taking advantage of her. I didn‚Äôt want her to see me as a failure, and I didn‚Äôt want to admit that I couldn‚Äôt figure things out. I thought if I kept up the lie long enough, I‚Äôd be able to get it together and be the person I was pretending to be. I thought I was protecting her from the disappointment.

But yesterday, everything blew up.

I came home early, and she wasn‚Äôt at work ‚Äî she‚Äôd called in sick. I panicked and said I was sick too, but she saw right through me. A few minutes later, she confronted me and told me she had checked footage from the cameras in the house ‚Äî cameras I didn‚Äôt even know existed. That‚Äôs when she realized I hadn‚Äôt been working at all.

She called it financial abuse. That hit me like a ton of bricks. I never meant to manipulate her, but I understand why she felt that way now. I wasn‚Äôt trying to use her ‚Äî I was just scared. Scared of the truth. Scared of letting her down. But the truth is, I hurt her deeply, and I can‚Äôt undo that.

She packed her things and left. Her family is furious with me, and now I‚Äôm left here, alone, dealing with the mess I created. I know I messed up. I get that now. But I never wanted to hurt her. I was just trying to protect myself from the embarrassment and disappointment. Now I‚Äôve lost her trust, and it feels like there‚Äôs no coming back from it.",0,1745726444.0,AITAH,9,0.5,False

It‚Äôs like stepping into an alternate universe where the rules are slightly broken and nobody‚Äôs watching. You walk in, the lights flicker like you're in a horror movie, and suddenly every sound is ten times louder. Somehow, even the copier seems to judge you for being there.

Today I realized that weekend office work basically turns you into a rogue employee. I was blasting music way too loud, having full-on debates with the coffee machine about who‚Äôs the real MVP, and for some reason, I found myself dramatically narrating emails like I‚Äôm the star of a very boring reality show. There‚Äôs this weird freedom to it, no meetings, no managers, just me trying to stay sane while slowly spiraling into chaos. I even caught myself spinning in my chair like a five-year-old because apparently that's what happens when no one's around to stop me.

And let‚Äôs talk about the breakroom. Why is there always one sad slice of cake from some birthday two weeks ago? Why does it call to me like some ancient cursed treasure? Weekend brain is real, and it had me considering questionable snack decisions.

Two months ago, I started taking several supplements to boost focus and overall health, including calcium with vitamin D3, omega-3, copper, B12 lozenges, and l-theanine with coffee. At first, I also used papaya enzyme lozenges but stopped them early on.

However, I began facing serious dental problems pain in my teeth, two broken molars, and gum inflammation. While waiting for my dentist appointment, I‚Äôve been using antibiotics and painkillers, but I can‚Äôt help wondering if these supplements caused my dental issues.

I hope my story serves as a reminder to consult a healthcare professional before starting supplements and to watch for unexpected side effects. If anyone has experienced something similar or knows why these supplements might cause such problems, please share your insights.

He seemed surprised by it, but when I asked if he had a girlfriend and if he wanted to go get coffee, he grabbed his phone right away and gave it to me. After I gave him my number, I went home.

1k8uuvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/1k8uuvm/iwantout_19m_burnside_port_elliot/,[IWantOut] 19m Burnside -> Port Elliot,"I‚Äôm a 19-year-old guy currently living in Burnside, a suburb about 6 km from Adelaide‚Äôs CBD. I‚Äôve been thinking about moving to an acre on the outskirts of Port Elliot, a coastal town on the Fleurieu Peninsula about an hour south of Adelaide. I‚Äôd love some advice from anyone who‚Äôs made a similar city-to-coastal/rural move, especially at a young age, or from locals in the Port Elliot/Victor Harbor area.

I‚Äôve lived in Burnside my whole life‚Äînice area, close to the city, lots of amenities like Burnside Village, good cafes, and easy access to uni and jobs. But I‚Äôm craving a change. The city feels a bit too busy for me lately, and I‚Äôve always loved the beach and nature. I drive to Port Elliot & Victor Harbor every time I get a day off and fall in love with the vibe. Horseshoe Bay, the quiet mornings, the open space. There‚Äôs an acre for sale just outside town, with a suburban area across the road to the south (so I‚Äôd have some amenities nearby) and rural properties to the north. It feels like a perfect mix of coastal, rural, and suburban life. Plus, it‚Äôs way more affordable than anything in Burnside.

My Situation: ‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm 19, just finished high school last year, and I‚Äôm working part-time in retail while figuring out my next steps. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll go to uni yet, but I might do some online courses or look into TAFE. ‚Ä¢ I‚Äôve got a car, so I can drive, but I‚Äôm used to Burnside‚Äôs buses for getting into the city. ‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm single, no dependents, and I‚Äôd be moving on my own (though my family would stay in Burnside). ‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm into outdoor stuff‚Äîhiking, surfing, running‚Äîand I heard there‚Äôs a parkrun in Victor Harbor that sounds awesome. I also like the idea of having an acre to maybe start a veggie garden or just have space to chill. What I‚Äôm Excited About: ‚Ä¢ The slower pace of life. I love the idea of waking up to ocean air, walking on a quiet beach at 7 a.m., and grabbing a coffee without the city chaos. ‚Ä¢ More space for less money. An acre in Port Elliot is so much cheaper than anything in Burnside, and I‚Äôd love the freedom of having my own land. ‚Ä¢ The community vibe. Port Elliot seems to have cool events like markets, and I‚Äôd love to meet new people, even if it‚Äôs a smaller crowd than Adelaide. ‚Ä¢ Nature and activities. The Fleurieu Peninsula has so much to offer‚Äîsurfing at Middleton, hiking in Deep Creek, whale watching. It feels like a playground for someone my age who loves the outdoors. What I‚Äôm Worried About: ‚Ä¢ Jobs and education: I‚Äôm not sure what work I‚Äôd find in Port Elliot. Maybe some casual stuff in tourism (cafes, retail), but I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôll be hard to find something stable. If I decide to study, commuting to Adelaide for uni or TAFE would be a pain (over an hour each way). ‚Ä¢ Social life: I‚Äôm 19, and I know Port Elliot skews older with retirees and families. I‚Äôve heard people say there‚Äôs ‚Äúnothing to do‚Äù and everyone‚Äôs in bed by 7:30 (lol). I don‚Äôt need a crazy nightlife, but I‚Äôd like to make friends my age. Will I feel isolated? ‚Ä¢ Amenities: Burnside has everything‚Äîshops, gyms, cinemas. Port Elliot has basics, and there‚Äôs a suburban town across the road, but I‚Äôd probably need to drive to Victor Harbor or even Adelaide for bigger stuff. ‚Ä¢ Rural challenges: I‚Äôve never lived on an acre before. I‚Äôm a bit nervous about things like slow internet, wildlife (snakes?), and managing stuff like septic systems or water tanks. ‚Ä¢ Distance from family/friends: My family and friends are all in Adelaide. I‚Äôd miss them, and I‚Äôm worried about feeling cut off if I can‚Äôt visit often. Questions:

Has anyone moved from a city suburb to a coastal/rural spot like Port Elliot at a young age? How did you adjust, especially with jobs and social life?
Port Elliot/Victor Harbor locals‚Äîwhat‚Äôs it really like living there as a 19-year-old? Are there people my age around, or will I struggle to make friends?
How hard is the commute to Adelaide if I need to go for work, study, or just to see friends/family? Is public transport doable, or do I need to rely on my car?
Any tips for managing an acre as a first-timer? I‚Äôm excited but also a bit overwhelmed by the idea of rural living.
Am I crazy for doing this at 19? Part of me thinks it‚Äôs a great adventure, but another part wonders if I should wait until I‚Äôm older and more settled. Any advice or experiences would be super helpful! I‚Äôm torn between the freedom and beauty of Port Elliot and the convenience of staying closer to Adelaide.

I (52M) have been married to my wife, Bea (50F), that's not her real name, for 25 years. We met through college, all that stuff, we married, and we hade 2 kids. About 2 years ago, I was diagnosed with cancer in my left leg, and it resulted on my leg getting amputated. I have to use a prosthetic to walk.

During my recovery, we didn't have much intimacy, as I received exhausting chemotherapy trying to save my leg before surgery was needed. And as I recovered, our intimate life was really damaged, as neither of us made any moves, and when we did, I enjoyed it, but she didn't seem to.

Well, during this time, new neighbors moved to the suburbs we live on. They didn't live right next to us, just on the same neighborhood. Let's call them Clara and Alex, not their real names. They were a married couple, and they moved here because Alex's parents' health had been declining, so they moved closer so Alex could go there to help them.

Well, Clara and Bea became good friends quickly, apparently, they had ran into each other a few times, and they started hanging out on weekends a lot. I became friends with Alex. Not as much as Bea and Clara did, but sometimes we hanged out to watch a game on free time or go to the bar. In their hangouts, my wife and Clara often went to Clara's house, drank some coffee, talked a lot, read some books they loved, and overly, they were good friends. I know this because early in their friendship, I went to one of these hangouts, I don't know nor think they are the same right now. Great right?

Well, during my recovery process, as I previously stated, we barely have intimacy. It was exhausting and painful to do so. She started spending a lot of time with Clara. I think you can guess what was happening.

Some hours ago, I was walking a bit. Chemotherapy took a toll on my body, but since I need to stay active if I don't want my health declining further, I started walking some months after the amputation. I was walking a bit, and I went out for about an hour. When I came back, I didn't see my wife in our home, and I guessed she was at Clara's. At this hour, Alex is often with his parents during weekends helping them, and my wife is at Clara's. She seemed like a teenager when hanging out with her, all weekends, for hours a day. They became really close.

Well, suddenly, I receive a message, it was from Alex. It said he came to his house to bring something he needed quickly, and he didn't see Clara. They are those people who put cameras everywhere in their house. I helped them install a few if them. He saw the camera on their bedroom to see if Clara was asleep to not do much noise, and... he found Clara fingering my wife and vice versa. I seriously don't know what to do. My wife is back right now, bathed already, cooking dinner downstairs... maybe my low intimacy caused this... but it still hurts.

tl;dr My wife cheated on me with her girl friend after my cancer recovery, and I need advice on what to do.",23,1745725090.0,Marriage,27,0.96,False

# Best Decorative Surfboard 2025: Top Styles & Where to Buy

No longer confined to beach houses, these vibrant and versatile artworks are finding their way into homes, offices, and even retail spaces, adding a touch of coastal charm and personality to any environment. In 2025, the trends are leaning towards eco-friendly materials, personalized designs, and unique artistic collaborations, making decorative surfboards a sophisticated way to express individual style and a love for the ocean.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best decorative surfboards of 2025 boast a combination of aesthetic appeal and high-quality craftsmanship. From the materials used to the artistry displayed, several features distinguish the top contenders in this market.

**Sustainable Wood Core:** Top-tier decorative surfboards are increasingly crafted from sustainable wood sources like bamboo, paulownia, or reclaimed timber. These materials offer a lighter weight, enhanced durability, and a reduced environmental impact compared to traditional surfboard construction. Using sustainable materials appeals to environmentally conscious consumers who want both style and responsibility.

**High-Resolution Printing Technology:** Advanced UV printing technology ensures vibrant, durable, and fade-resistant graphics on the surfboard surface. This allows for intricate designs, photorealistic images, and custom artwork to be seamlessly applied, providing endless possibilities for personalization. The resolution often exceeds 1440 dpi, guaranteeing crisp details and rich color saturation.

**Epoxy Resin Coating:** A high-gloss epoxy resin coating provides a protective layer against scratches, UV damage, and moisture. This coating not only enhances the visual appeal of the surfboard but also extends its lifespan, ensuring that the artwork remains vibrant for years to come. The epoxy is often formulated to be low-VOC, further minimizing environmental impact.

**Hand-Shaped Rails and Contours:** While some decorative surfboards are mass-produced, the best ones often feature hand-shaped rails and contours, adding a touch of artisanal craftsmanship. These subtle details can significantly enhance the surfboard's visual appeal, giving it a more authentic and refined look. Hand-shaping allows for unique designs and personalized touches that are not possible with machine production.

**Integrated Mounting System:** A secure and discreet mounting system is essential for displaying a decorative surfboard. Top models feature pre-installed mounting brackets or recessed keyholes that allow for easy and secure wall mounting. The mounting system is typically designed to be virtually invisible, allowing the surfboard to float seamlessly on the wall.

**Artist Collaboration and Limited Editions:** Many brands are collaborating with artists to create limited-edition decorative surfboards. These collaborations often result in unique and highly sought-after pieces that are considered works of art. The exclusivity of these designs adds to their appeal and value, making them a worthwhile investment for collectors and art enthusiasts.

 ## Core Benefits

Decorative surfboards offer a unique blend of aesthetic appeal and practical benefits, making them a valuable addition to any interior design scheme. They go beyond mere decoration, providing a means of personal expression and creating a distinct atmosphere in a space.

**Enhanced Aesthetic Appeal:** A decorative surfboard can instantly transform a room, adding a touch of coastal charm, bohemian flair, or modern sophistication. They serve as eye-catching focal points that draw attention and create a sense of visual interest. For example, a brightly colored surfboard with a tropical print can bring a sense of vibrancy and energy to a living room, while a minimalist surfboard with a geometric design can complement a contemporary office space.

**Personal Expression and Storytelling:** Decorative surfboards offer a unique opportunity to express personal interests and passions. Whether it's a love for surfing, a connection to the ocean, or an appreciation for art, a decorative surfboard can tell a story about the homeowner's personality and experiences. A surfboard featuring a map of a favorite surf spot can evoke memories of past adventures, while a custom-painted surfboard can showcase personal artistic talent.

**Versatile Decorating Options:** Decorative surfboards can be incorporated into a wide range of interior design styles, from coastal and bohemian to modern and minimalist. They can be displayed horizontally or vertically, used as headboards, or even repurposed as coffee tables or bar tops. For example, a vintage surfboard can be used to create a rustic and eclectic living room, while a sleek, modern surfboard can complement a minimalist bedroom design.

**Conversation Starter and Statement Piece:** A well-chosen decorative surfboard is sure to spark conversations and impress guests. It's a unique and unexpected decor item that adds personality and character to a space. A surfboard featuring an unusual design or a collaboration with a renowned artist can become a talking point, allowing homeowners to share their passion for art, surfing, or design.

**Investment Value and Collectibility:** Limited-edition decorative surfboards, particularly those created in collaboration with artists, can appreciate in value over time. These pieces are considered collectibles and can be a worthwhile investment for art enthusiasts. The rarity and uniqueness of these surfboards contribute to their appeal and potential for future appreciation.

 ## FAQs Section

Consumers often have questions about decorative surfboards regarding their suitability for different environments, installation, and maintenance. Addressing these concerns helps potential buyers make informed decisions.

**Are decorative surfboards suitable for outdoor use?**

Most decorative surfboards are designed for indoor use only. Prolonged exposure to sunlight, rain, and extreme temperatures can damage the artwork and the surfboard's structure. However, some manufacturers offer outdoor-rated surfboards with UV-resistant coatings and weather-proof materials. These are specifically designed for outdoor display but may come at a higher cost.

**How do I clean and maintain a decorative surfboard?**

To clean a decorative surfboard, simply wipe it down with a soft, damp cloth. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the artwork or the epoxy resin coating. For stubborn stains, a mild soap solution can be used. Regular dusting and cleaning will help maintain the surfboard's appearance and prevent the build-up of dirt and grime.

**What is the best way to hang a decorative surfboard?**

The best way to hang a decorative surfboard depends on its size and weight. Most surfboards come with pre-installed mounting brackets or recessed keyholes for easy wall mounting. Use appropriate hardware, such as wall anchors or screws, to ensure a secure and stable installation. For heavier surfboards, it's recommended to use professional installation services to avoid any potential damage or accidents.

**Can I customize a decorative surfboard with my own artwork?**

Many manufacturers offer customization services that allow customers to create their own unique decorative surfboards. This typically involves submitting your own artwork or designs, which are then printed onto the surfboard using UV printing technology. Customization options may also include selecting the surfboard's shape, size, and finish. Contacting the manufacturer directly is the best way to explore customization possibilities.

1k8urh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Broadway/comments/1k8urh0/moulin_rouge_tour/,Moulin Rouge Tour,"I just saw the tour of Moulin Rouge and I figured I‚Äôd provide a mini review since I know I often look for tour reviews out of curiosity, so maybe someone else will appreciate it.

First things first; if you love the movie‚Ä¶ this ain‚Äôt it. I‚Äôll say more later but it‚Äôs like comparing your favorite song from your favorite band to that coffee shop guy on acoustic playing it in the background. It‚Äôs just a cheap copy.

I‚Äôll start with negatives because I always prefer to end more positively. First is it just lacks intensity and tonal cohesion. There were multiple buttons put in where I thought they definitely should have killed them to keep the tone going (most notably the break for applause prior to the show within the show premiering. Absolutely should not have held for applause imo). I‚Äôm not against humor and levity in darker shows by any means but it felt excessive here. It‚Äôs a dark show at heart and it felt like too much was played for laughs.

That feeds right into my next critique. The more recent music thrown in is generally not done to great effect. People were laughing at songs just for appearing because they felt so out of place in the show. Some of them were done well (I personally very much enjoyed the Bad Romance, Toxic, etc. sequence) but lots of them were practically jumpscares. They also didn‚Äôt blend as well as the original movie. From what I remember (though it‚Äôs been awhile) the original movie blended songs much more seamlessly together whereas some of these felt literally like they were tacked on.

Finally, my last major critique is that it‚Äôs just overwhelming. Maybe it‚Äôs our theater, but the sound was too loud. The lights shining out concert style were blinding at times. The fast-paced, tacked on songs were often just too much. I don‚Äôt have overstimulation usually but I almost felt like I needed to hide in a blanket at times haha.

Okay, positives. Performances were wonderful. The blending of the ensemble was a little rough on occasion, but mostly the performances were great. Toulouse and Satine especially wowed me. Nature Boy from Toulouse was utterly captivating and Satine did Firework a million times better than Katy Perry could dream of doing it. 

I think the dancing was very good, though I‚Äôm no expert. I really enjoyed, as mentioned before, the entire Bad Romance, Toxic, Tainted Love etc. piece.

Related to that, parts of the lighting were done very well. Especially during emotional moments, they nailed some of those lighting cues to add to the drama.

So, would I recommend it? Eh if it‚Äôs on your season, I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily skip it, or if you find cheap tickets and you‚Äôre intrigued, go for it. But I wouldn‚Äôt be rushing out to see it either. It‚Äôs not particularly good art but it IS kinda fun. Everyone gave it their all and I have few -if any- complaints about the quality of the performance, it‚Äôs really just failed by the choices made by the ones adapting the movie.

The project has changed the lives of many thousands of community members.  
  
A Kendu (can-do) attitude has made countless people get up off the couch, out of retirement, and out on the streets building under the brand umbrella.  
  
The Kendu community has built:  
  
\- A Kendu Games Studio with ex-Bioware and AAA game devs  
\- Kendu beers  
\- A Kendu board game   
\- Kendu energy drinks  
\- Kendu events company in India  
\- Kendu events presence USA  
\- Kendu sports brand (You Kendu It)   
\- Kendu eSports team   
\- Kendu coffee brand  
\- Kendu sweets, chocolates, and spirits  
\- Much more in the works  
  
Kendu has brought crypto to life, and life to those in crypto. It's an exceptional project the likes of which doesn't exist and hasn't been attempted.   
  
Imagine a permissionless brand behemoth that anyone can build under, immediately tapping into a scaling CaaS (Community-as-a-service), where the treasury is voluntarily, not contractually, is replenished by those building businesses under Kendu, and that treasury is transparently used for grants for products, businesses, or initiatives the community wants to build with Kendu. Almost akin to an L1.   


And of course kendu is still a memecoin so everything relates back to the Kendu dog on the coin for those wondering. I believe Kendu will become the industry standard, forcing future coins to start innovating rather than trying the same structure of the typical coin we see today: create some bland narrative,  start getting KOLs to call it (mad apes, pow etc... people who only want supply) and then proceed to run the coin for a week before leaving it.



You can Kendufy anything. And everything will be Kendufied.

**The Visit**

The clunk and pop of a car switching gears into park echoed on the empty suburban street. Leaves blew around the white and black Crown Victoria like the ocean around a jagged rock on the bank of a pier.

A man sat in the car, taking a deep breath. His portly gut pushed against the leather-wrapped steering wheel. The door clunked open, and the man stepped out with some struggle. A pair of black police combat boots hit the ground first. Attached to the boots were legs clad in dark navy blue police slacks, and attached to that, a chubby torso wrapped in a police button-down shirt, complete with a gun holster, taser, and other policeman tools. The shiny cherry on top of the heavy-breathing chest was a bronze badge reading **Chief Wallum**.

He licked his lips, trying to find a drop of saliva to wet his bone-dry mouth.

‚ÄúShit‚Ä¶ shit,‚Äù Wallum muttered to himself as he approached the homely house. The sun was beginning to set; he‚Äôd been putting this off the better part of the day.

The wooden porch was cluttered with tchotchkes, potted plants, and a weather-beaten welcome mat. Wallum looked at his reflection in the glass storm door before hitting the doorbell. A faint ring echoed inside, followed by a small dog barking.

‚ÄúShhh, shh, calm yourselves now, calm yourselves!‚Äù an old Southern-drawled voice called from behind the door.

The faded red door opened, revealing a short woman, half the height of the cop, with curlers in her hair and a pink robe. You‚Äôd think she was a character in a sitcom at first glance, she was so stereotypical. She squinted up at the cop.

‚ÄúOh boy, what he done now?‚Äù she sighed.

‚ÄúNice to see you too, Mrs. Frita. You mind if I come in and talk to you?‚Äù Wallum asked, gesturing past her.

Mrs. Frita turned to let him in.

‚ÄúI suppose. I reckon yous want some coffee?‚Äù

The house was decorated with candles, paintings, and countless family photos ‚Äî mostly of Mrs. Frita and a skinny, brown-haired boy who looked no older than 17. Wallum sat at the old, lost-to-time dinner table under a stained-glass lamp, which reminded him almost of an interrogation room ‚Äî one he was all too familiar with.

He remembered yelling in her son‚Äôs face, asking incriminating questions, figuring out who her son sold drugs for, who he helped beat. But that was some time ago.

After handing Wallum a warm cup of dark coffee, Mrs. Frita joined him at the table.

‚ÄúSo what, caught him selling dope again? Whatever led him astray‚Ä¶‚Äù

Chief Wallum swallowed a hard lump ‚Äî the first of many.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not a bad child,‚Äù Mrs. Frita interjected. Five seconds of silence passed, disturbed only by the ticking clock.

‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶ I know he has done bad‚Ä¶ done no good, but he don‚Äôt have a bad heart. He is disturbed, lord knows he is disturbed by anger.‚Äù

Wallum leaned back, searching for how to word his next delicate sentence. Mrs. Frita scanned his face. She felt unease, like something was amiss.

‚ÄúOh lord, he ain‚Äôt dead, is he?‚Äù

Wallum looked startled, like the plan he was making in his head was completely ruined.

‚ÄúUh, well‚Ä¶ yes. We found a body.‚Äù

He could see the impact of the words ‚Äî like a metal baseball bat hitting her smack dab on the nose. To be honest, he hated her son. Thought he was a punk. A punk for burgling an elderly man‚Äôs home and beating him nearly to death. A punk for jumping kids half his age for owing him money. And most recently, a punk who killed a man‚Äôs daughter because she sold his sneakers for an ounce of rock. Snuffed a life for a few hours‚Äô worth of drugs.

He knew this would devastate his mother. Part of him thought he might even enjoy telling her about his death and wrongdoings ‚Äî a final laugh.

‚ÄúGuess this isn‚Äôt shocking news. I was wondering when this would come.‚Äù

A long pause of silence.

‚ÄúI mourned his life the first time we met, when you told me you picked him up selling rock to a child no older than my own.‚Äù She shook her head and stood up.

‚ÄúMrs. Frita, I apologize for the news, but we need you to understand the circumstances‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you hated him,‚Äù she cut him off, walking to the room next to the dining room. ‚ÄúI know you have your reasons. I know he did wrong.‚Äù

She called from the next room, rooting around in a floor chest. Wallum waited for her return before diving into the gruesome details.

‚ÄúI know there‚Äôs things you haven‚Äôt told me he did. Bet he‚Äôs worse than I thought.‚Äù

She returned holding a large leather-bound book.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt get afternoons like this. C‚Äômon, let‚Äôs go sit out back.‚Äù

They moved to her back porch overlooking a neighboring cornfield, sitting in cheap plastic outdoor chairs. A small table divided them, the leather-bound book opened on top.

‚Äú1979. The Lord gave me the strength to born Daniel.‚Äù

Daniel. God, his name made Wallum‚Äôs blood boil ‚Äî the little shit he‚Äôd been chasing for months.

‚ÄúBefore the lying and sneaking out, the drugs, he was filled with happiness. Before the anger.‚Äù

An old photo showed a boy standing with an older man, his father, in a creek. A large, toothless smile plastered the boy‚Äôs face, the father smiling as well. Wallum remembered the man‚Äôs face well ‚Äî about six years ago that man had been gunned down by some thugs in town over a dent in their car.

‚ÄúThat boy loved his father, you know.‚Äù

Wallum was shocked to feel a shred of pity.

‚ÄúI reckon he did. Charles was a good man.‚Äù That was his name ‚Äî Wallum had almost forgotten.

‚ÄúYou remember when Daniel ran out that pharmacy with that Mars bar when he was, what, nine? Boy, Charles grabbed him up and you were there!‚Äù

Wallum chuckled.

‚ÄúYeah, I was writing parking tickets. Charles brought him over and made me act like I was arresting him to scare him straight.‚Äù

A joint laugh filled the backyard.

‚ÄúOh, I was so mad, I was gonna spank that child‚Äôs behind raw, but Charles said to leave the boy alone. He was always so sweet on that boy,‚Äù Mrs. Frita sighed.

Wallum thought of his own son. How once his boy knocked over a paint bucket out of anger for being ignored, earning his first whooping. Wallum had felt pity then, too.

‚ÄúAnd here,‚Äù she continued, ‚Äúwhen he joined the Boy Scouts. Loved the little pocket knife they gave him. Said he was Tarzan and would slash my roses. Oh, he was a wild child.‚Äù

A photo showed Daniel with his fellow scouts, shoulder to shoulder. Another toothless grin.

‚ÄúI know you see the rage and evil my child has done, but before his daddy died‚Ä¶ I can still see the happiness in that boy.‚Äù

Wallum checked his watch. He knew he needed to tell Mrs. Frita the deeds her son had done. But why did he feel dread?





**The Body**

Three nights prior, by the river outside town, cop lights and spotlights reflected off the water, creating a twisted version of the aurora borealis. A crowd of police, EMTs, and volunteers waded through the water with flashlights.

*God, I‚Äôm freezing,* Wallum thought. *Freezing my ass off trying to find out what this kid did.*

The noise of sloshing through murky water filled the air, mixing with the smell of earth and algae bloom. Only anger kept him warm. They had a tip: the gang Daniel ran with had dumped a large bag of drugs in the water ‚Äî if they found it, they could tie Daniel directly to it.

He thought of the warm plate of food waiting for him at home, wrapped in aluminum foil like a Christmas gift.

‚ÄúHey! Over here, found something!‚Äù

Wallum, the closest cop, sloshed over fast. Together they lifted a large duffle bag ‚Äî or something like it.

‚ÄúJesus, this must be a shit ton of drugs. Weighs like 200 pounds.‚Äù

Wallum gripped the bag, feeling something odd ‚Äî not the tight blocks of drugs he expected, but something squishier, harder.

He asked for a light. Someone shined it onto the bag.

Wallum noticed the bag‚Äôs odd shape ‚Äî almost like a body bag.

The zipper revealed a most foul odor‚Ä¶ and a shocking image.

A boy, his own son‚Äôs age, bloated and green with decay, a red-pinkish hole in his forehead.

‚ÄúJesus Christ, it‚Äôs a kid,‚Äù a nearby man called.

‚ÄúNo shit. It‚Äôs Daniel,‚Äù Wallum muttered.

Shock didn‚Äôt come. Instead, a grim satisfaction. Daniel had died in a godawful, rotten way.

They dragged the body out. The coroner came.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll stop by his mama‚Äôs house tomorrow and let her know,‚Äù Wallum said, sipping hot coffee and lighting a cigarette.

A fellow officer asked, ‚ÄúYou reckon it‚Äôs gonna be easy? You know‚Ä¶ telling her?‚Äù

Wallum exhaled a cloud of smoke.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôll know what a rotten boy he was. Might sting, but what else did she expect?‚Äù





**The Illusion**

‚ÄúMrs. Frita‚Ä¶ your son was already being investigated for some other things besides the drugs.‚Äù Wallum could only look at the floor, then his feet, and back again.

‚ÄúOh lord, what else‚Ä¶ what else did my child do?‚Äù

Wallum swallowed hard.

*How could such a rotten boy come from someone so sweet?* he thought.

*Was he born bad? Was his father‚Äôs death the reason?*

‚ÄúWhatever he did, he didn‚Äôt mean to hurt nobody. I know it. We tried, we loved him. I still love him. Did he hurt someone?‚Äù

Wallum knew he was a lousy liar.

‚ÄúHe was caught up with some trespassing charges. Light theft. Nothing else is all,‚Äù he said ‚Äî technically not lying.

‚ÄúI reckon he was trying to better himself. I heard he was trying to leave the gang and move upstate.‚Äù

1k8ungn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k8ungn/aita_for_asking_my_father_to_find_different/,AITA for asking my father to find different housing,"I (31) live in a house I‚Äôve lived in nearly my whole life. The house was purchased by mother‚Äôs parents and was set up in a trust that eventually had me named as executor after my mother passed away. My father (67) and older brother (34 and who was a serious heroin addict up to and after the passing of my mother and both of her parents and who I have been estranged with for close to 10 years at this point) were not included in the trust for reasons that should become obvious if they aren‚Äôt already. My younger sister also remains living in the home and she was included as a beneficiary of the trust. 

My dad has never left the house but after school and some other jobs I have been living in the house again since 2019. I have never charged my father rent. He has paid a small share of utilities (out of his social security checks) but that is all. 

My dad lives like a pig. Up until relatively recently he spent most of his time downstairs where he absolutely ruined a couch with his filthy lifestyle and would often leave cups filled with urine on the coffee table. I finally got him to stop spending time downstairs and got rid of the couch and the room he now occupies contains the majority of his frankly disgusting ways. He has lived this way for most of my life. 

I would describe myself as a serious late bloomer in life and have matured significantly in the last several years and have been in therapy for some time now. It‚Äôs through that and talking with my close friend group that I have begun having serious issues with how my parents raised us. My father has always been a remarkably immature person and as such was never able to teach me anything about being an adult or being a man. 

The person I am today is completely in spite of any of his doing as a parent. Or my mother for that matter who I would also have issues with if she were still alive today. 

I also have serious issues about his lack of responsibility as a husband. My mother was incredibly sick and depressed woman and she only got worse and worse year after year and my father never showed any inclination to help her. In her latter years she was unable to easily get to the bathroom and resorted to urinating on the floor at times. My father has claimed ignorance of this in the past. 

What my father did do is cheat on her often with escorts and at massage parlors and was even arrested once for soliciting. 

No one has ever called out my father for this behavior until I did this past week. 

To no surprise he remained completely indignant. He could not even fathom why I would have an issue with his parenting of me. When I asked if he saw any failures in himself as parent the only thing he could point to was my brother‚Äôs drug addiction. My brother remains in contact with my father and clearly placates him and allows him to live in his delusion that he was a good parent and father. 
 
A major problem I had with my father was an instance where he violently hit my sister in a moment that remains remarkably traumatic for her. He completely denied it happened or that he ever laid a hand on his kids ever. For the record I watched it happen myself and my sister has had the same story ever since it happened. It definitely happened. 

When I got to my issues with him as a husband he immediately turned it onto his kids. ‚ÄúAnd what did you do for mommy?!‚Äù He said to me. I calmly responded ‚Äúwe were children‚Äù over and over until he said ‚Äúspoiled fucking children‚Äù. He holds no responsibility to his wife slowly dying as he watched on the sidelines. 

At the end of the conversation I said he needs to find new housing. Based on his reactions I see no way to repair this relationship especially while he is living in the house. I said I‚Äôd give him time obviously to figure it out but it‚Äôs best for everyone to not live in this house anymore. 

He stormed out and soon after my estranged brother began texting me calling me a ‚Äúpiece of shit‚Äù and other horrible things. We went back and forth for a while with him continuing to speak bile to me even after I said I was leaving the conversation. 

Last night he continued to scream into the void via our text chain and when he couldn‚Äôt get me to respond he stepped up to a new level of evil. 

He texted my sister who doesn‚Äôt know his number since he also did some horrific things to her while at his worst drug use. He pretended to be our dead grandmother and said awful things in an effort to intimidate her. 

My father claimed I was a spoiled child in not helping my dying mother. I think the only spoiled children here are my father and brother and I feel zero responsibility to help either of them ever.

Any advice?,"My (26F) boyfriend (28M) and I have been together for three years and have lived together for two. Things are mostly good, but he has this tendency to delay like crazy and it makes us late all the time, and it‚Äôs honestly really starting to bug me.

I have a very time consuming and demanding job, and pretty limited free time. I don‚Äôt like to waste time, since I don‚Äôt have much to spare. My boyfriend‚Äôs job is very chill and he works totally remote, so he just has a lot more time. He moves through the world at a very slow pace, and it‚Äôs amazing how much extra time is added on just by him going through life.

For example, every morning I need to wake him several times before he‚Äôll get up. Once he gets up, it seems to take him ten minutes just to get dressed. While he‚Äôs getting up and getting dressed, I‚Äôll feed the dog and make coffee and get cereal ready for us. When he‚Äôs out of town, I am out the door in literally half the time.

He drags his feet on any activity that involves me or my friends. Somehow we are always late and I will be sitting by the door, fully ready, waiting for him for like half an hour before he‚Äôll eventually be ready to go. 

Today, we had an event for some friends of mine who are starting a nonprofit. It was at noon. We are training for a marathon currently and had to work in a long run in the morning before noon. I told him we‚Äôd need to get out on the run by 9 to pull it off. He dragged and dragged his feet getting up and getting ready. I sat there fully ready to go for a half hour before he finally made his way over at 9:30 to go.

We did the run, came back, and he took the longest time to get ready yet again. He sat around on his phone for a long time and only stopped when I was like, ‚Äúhello, we really need to get going‚Ä¶‚Äù we got to the event a full HOUR late and the thing had already gotten going. It was very embarrassing to interrupt and I felt bad for the friends, because they had clearly been expecting us earlier.

Meanwhile, when it comes to *his* things, I feel like he‚Äôs always on time. He had no problem getting there on time or getting there early. He has no issue getting up on time. This makes me feel like he just doesn‚Äôt care about my friends/my schedule.

I have told him a lot of times that this bugs me and I don‚Äôt like to be late when there‚Äôs a specific time to arrive. I‚Äôve told him I would love it if he could plan ahead a bit so we could leave on time for things. He kind of laughs me off or says ‚Äúyeah yeah‚Äù when I bring it up. It‚Äôs very frustrating!

**TL;DR: Boyfriend is always late and very slow moving. I spend a lot of time sitting around waiting for him. He seems to have no problem leaving on time for his own stuff, though. I‚Äôve brought it up many times and he blows me off about it.**

Start with the right coffee-to-water ratio and brewing time.**

These key steps ensure a rich and flavorful cup every time. French press coffee is loved for its bold taste and simplicity. Unlike drip coffee, it allows full immersion of coffee grounds, extracting more flavor. This method is ideal for those who appreciate a robust coffee experience.

To brew a perfect cup, you need fresh coffee beans and clean equipment. The process involves a few easy steps, but attention to detail makes all the difference. Whether you‚Äôre a coffee enthusiast or just exploring, understanding this method enhances your coffee-making skills. Dive into the art of French press brewing and discover how to achieve that perfect cup every morning.

# Choosing The Right Beans

Making the¬†[perfect French press coffee starts with choosing the right beans](https://gomehedi.com/best-coffee-beans-for-french-press/). The type of coffee beans you select and their freshness play a crucial role in the flavor and aroma of your brew. Understanding the different types of beans and their characteristics can help you make an informed choice.

# Types Of Coffee Beans

There are two main types of coffee beans:¬†**Arabica**¬†and¬†**Robusta**. Each has its unique flavor profile and characteristics.

**Arabica:**

* Smoother and sweeter taste
* Higher acidity
* More complex flavors
* Grown at higher altitudes

**Robusta:**

* Stronger, harsher taste
* Higher caffeine content
* More bitter flavors
* Grown at lower altitudes

Arabica beans are generally preferred for French press coffee due to their smooth and rich flavor. Robusta beans, while more bitter, can add a strong kick to your coffee.

Here‚Äôs a quick comparison:

|Feature|Arabica|Robusta|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Taste|Smooth and sweet|Strong and bitter|
|Acidity|High|Low|
|Caffeine|Lower|Higher|
|Altitude|Higher|Lower|

# Freshness Matters

Freshness is key to a great cup of French press coffee. Fresh beans offer more aroma and flavor. Here are some tips to ensure you get the freshest beans:

1. **Check the roast date:**¬†Always look for the roast date on the bag. Beans are best used within 2-4 weeks of roasting.
2. **Buy whole beans:**¬†Whole beans stay fresher longer than pre-ground coffee. Grind them just before brewing.
3. **Store properly:**¬†Keep beans in an airtight container, away from light, heat, and moisture.
4. **Buy in small quantities:**¬†Purchase only what you‚Äôll use within a few weeks to ensure you always have fresh beans.

Using fresh beans can significantly enhance your French press coffee experience. The right storage and timely use of beans will maintain their optimal flavor.

In summary, choosing the right beans and ensuring they are fresh are essential steps in making perfect French press coffee. Whether you prefer Arabica or Robusta, always focus on quality and freshness for the best results.



# Grinding The Coffee

Making a perfect French Press coffee is an art. It begins with grinding the coffee. The grind sets the tone for the coffee‚Äôs flavor and texture. This crucial step can make or break your brew. Grinding the coffee beans just right is essential. It helps to release the rich flavors locked inside. With the right grind, your French Press will deliver a delicious cup every time.

# Coarse Grind Essentials

For French Press coffee, a¬†**coarse grind**¬†is key. It ensures that the coffee doesn‚Äôt turn out bitter or overly strong. Coarse grind looks like sea salt, with large and even particles. This type of grind allows water to extract flavors slowly. It prevents over-extraction, which can lead to a harsh taste. The grind should be consistent. Uneven grinds can affect the brewing process. They can cause some coffee to be over-extracted while some remain under-extracted.

Consider these points for achieving the perfect coarse grind:

* **Consistency:**¬†Use a grinder that produces even-sized particles.
* **Size:**¬†Aim for particles similar to breadcrumbs or sea salt.
* **Flavor:**¬†Coarse grind enhances the natural flavors of the coffee.

|Grind Size|Resemblance|
|:-|:-|
|Coarse|Sea Salt|
|Medium|Sand|
|Fine|Sugar|

# Grinder Options

Choosing the right grinder can elevate your coffee experience. There are several types, each with unique benefits. A¬†**burr grinder**¬†is popular for its precision. It uses two revolving surfaces to crush the coffee beans. This results in a consistent grind size. Blade grinders, while more affordable, offer less consistency. They chop the beans, resulting in uneven particle sizes.

Exploring grinder options:

1. **Burr Grinder:**¬†Offers precision and consistency. Ideal for French Press.
2. **Blade Grinder:**¬†Budget-friendly but less consistent. Not recommended for coarse grind.
3. **Manual Grinder:**¬†Portable and quiet. Good for small batches.

Here‚Äôs a quick comparison:

|Grinder Type|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Burr Grinder|Consistent grind, precise|Higher cost|
|Blade Grinder|Affordable, easy to use|Inconsistent grind|
|Manual Grinder|Portable, quiet|Requires effort|

Choosing the right grinder impacts your coffee‚Äôs taste. Invest wisely for a delightful coffee experience.

# Water Quality And Temperature

Introduction paragraph about How to Make a Perfect French Press Coffee? and Water Quality and Temperature‚Ä¶

# Importance Of Filtered Water

Water quality is crucial for brewing the perfect French Press coffee. Using¬†**filtered water**¬†can significantly enhance the taste of your coffee. Tap water often contains minerals and chemicals that can alter the flavor. Filtered water removes these impurities, ensuring a clean and pure taste.

Here are some key reasons to use filtered water:

* **Removes chlorine**: Chlorine in tap water can make coffee taste bitter.
* **Reduces hardness**: Hard water can cause scale buildup in your French Press.
* **Improves consistency**: Filtered water provides a consistent taste every time.

To highlight the difference, take a look at this table comparing tap water and filtered water:

|Aspect|Tap Water|Filtered Water|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Chlorine|Present|Removed|
|Minerals|Variable|Reduced|
|Taste|Inconsistent|Consistent|

Using filtered water not only improves the taste of your coffee but also extends the lifespan of your French Press. Over time, minerals in tap water can cause damage to the coffee maker. Filtered water is a small step that makes a big difference.

# Ideal Brewing Temperature

The temperature of the water is another crucial factor in making the perfect French Press coffee. The ideal brewing temperature is between¬†**195¬∞F and 205¬∞F (90¬∞C to 96¬∞C)**. Water that is too hot can scald the coffee, making it bitter. Water that is too cold will not extract the full flavor from the coffee grounds.

Here‚Äôs a simple guide to achieve the perfect brewing temperature:

1. **Boil water**: Start by bringing water to a rolling boil.
2. **Let it sit**: Remove the water from heat and let it sit for about 30 seconds.
3. **Check temperature**: Use a thermometer to ensure the water is within the ideal range.

For those who prefer a visual guide, here‚Äôs a quick reference table:

|Water Temperature|Effect on Coffee|
|:-|:-|
|Below 195¬∞F (90¬∞C)|Under-extracted, weak flavor|
|195¬∞F ‚Äì 205¬∞F (90¬∞C ‚Äì 96¬∞C)|Perfectly balanced, full flavor|
|Above 205¬∞F (96¬∞C)|Scalded, bitter taste|

Maintaining the right temperature is essential for extracting the best flavors from your coffee. Use a thermometer to monitor the temperature, or let the boiled water sit for about 30 seconds before pouring it over the coffee grounds. This small step will make a significant difference in the quality of your French Press coffee.

# Measuring Coffee And Water

Making a perfect French press coffee can be an art. One important step is measuring the coffee and water correctly. Getting this right will lead to a delicious cup of coffee. This step is crucial for achieving the right flavor and strength. Learn how to measure coffee and water for the best results every time.

# Coffee To Water Ratio

The coffee to water ratio is a key part of brewing French press coffee. This ratio affects the taste and strength of your coffee. A common ratio is¬†**1:15**, which means 1 gram of coffee for every 15 grams of water. Some people prefer a stronger brew, using a 1:12 ratio.

Here‚Äôs a simple table for quick reference:

|Coffee (grams)|Water (grams)|
|:-|:-|
|20|300|
|30|450|
|40|600|

Follow these steps for measuring:

* Decide on your preferred strength.
* Use the table above as a guide.
* Weigh the coffee and water accurately.

Remember, slight changes in the ratio can greatly affect the taste. Experiment to find what suits your palate best.

# Tools For Measurement

Accurate measurement tools are essential for making French press coffee. They help ensure consistency and improve your brewing technique. Here are some tools to consider:

* **Digital Scale:**¬†A digital scale is the most accurate tool for measuring coffee and water. It provides precise measurements, which is important for maintaining consistency.
* **Measuring Spoon:**¬†While less precise than a scale, a measuring spoon can be useful for quick measurements. Use it if you don‚Äôt have a scale handy.
* **Kettle with Measurement Marks:**¬†A kettle with measurement marks helps you pour the correct amount of water.

Using these tools makes the process easier:

1. Place the French press on the scale.
2. Add coffee until you reach the desired weight.
3. Pour water, watching the scale or using the kettle marks.

About 18 months I had a colonoscopy done because of colon cancer in my family and was informed I had diverticules. The doctor explained what they were and told me if ever I had bad stomach cramps and fever to go to the hospital right away and inform them about this. She also told me to eat lots of fibers. I knew some of my ex in-laws had had diverticulitis, one had part of their intestines removed and the other just had a flare up once.

About 5 weeks ago I started having some sharp pain in me lower left side, I wasn't too worried as I had my birthday a few weeks before and had eaten a lot of rich food and chocolate, I thought my stomach was just more sensitive as I'm in my 50s now but the pain got more intense, like stabbing in my lower left side during the day, about one or two times an hour.

I had a feeling it might be diverticulitis but seeing how I had no fever I didn't think I needed to see a doctor. Instead, I decided to eat more fiber as I thought that was what I was meant to do, I was munching on carrots and oranges all day long. I also phoned my provinces' health line where a nurse asked me about my symptoms and told me it should go away on it's own but, if it didn't, then to try and get a doctor's appointment, something quite difficult to do where I am from. 3 days later it wasn't getting better so I was ready to go to the hospital but got very lucky and found a walk-in clinic for the same day that could see me.

When I saw the doctor I explained I had already had a diagnosis for diverticules and his eyes opened wide and, after examining me, said it was most likely diverticulitis but it would take a CT scan to be 100% sure but, because our healthcare system is strained, he didn't want me to get one and prescribed me 2 kinds of antibiotics for 14 day. He didn't tell me anything about what to eat so I used the internet and chatGPT and figured I should go on a very low fiber diet, I didn't think I needed a liquid only diet as I hadn't had any fever.

The antibiotics hit kind of hard and I have a lot of other stress factors going on as well as having health anxiety so it all felt overwhelming and intense. I took a couple of days off work and felt really bad. I was taking my temperature and it was always very low and that was worrying me, I bought another thermometer just in case but it also showed a low temperature, one morning it was 34.8. So, I got another doctor's appointment, I was very lucky again to get one for the same day. Unfortunately, the doctor had an emergency and my appointment was pushed back 2 days but the nurse had taken my vitals and consulted with another doctor and because I had no fever they told me I would be fine waiting 2 days.

When I saw the second doctor he examined me again and I felt a lot less pain so he said it looked like I was recovering well. He informed me that I didn't have a real diagnosis for diverticulitis as I hadn't had a CT scan, when I asked him about what I should eat he said he wasn't a nutritionist... He also mentioned it was most likely not cancer which also freaked me out. During this time I had managed to get a phone consultation with my family doctor, I had asked for one at the beginning of my adventure but it always takes a long time to see her. 

When I did speak to my family doctor, she told me to go to the hospital the next day, spend the day there if I must, but it was important to get an ultrasound to make sure nothing was still wrong. So, I went to the hospital the next morning and after 7 hours had had my blood and urine tested as well as having a CT scan, I was quite happy with the service as I thought it would take much longer than that. The doctor informed me that there was no more infection, no cancer but they could see that a diverticule was still recovering. When asked what to eat they told me to look it up on the internet. Still, it was quite a relief having all the tests, no idea why my family doctor thought I would need an ultrasound, the CT scan seems to be what was needed.

Those two weeks on antibiotics were really hard, my doctor prescribed me anti-depressants that I've started now. I have trouble with my sleep and still feel a bit of weirdness in my lower left side before passing gas. ChatGpt was so useful as it told me what to eat, I'm still mainly eating non enriched white bread, eggs, rice, overcooked carrots and peeled zucchinis and mashed potatoes. Eating, coffee and a bottle of wine over the weekend were my favorite indulgences, I feel like I'm going a bit crazy now, and it seems I won't be eating any raw veggies for another 3-4 weeks. I can't believe how long it takes to recover!

I was doubting chatGPT so I asked it for sources, one of them was this sub-reddit, and after reading some posts I now consider myself extremely lucky and will not be rushing to eat raw carrots or burritos, I'm going to take the time it takes to recover before attempting to go back to eating like before.

I (52M) have been married to my wife, Bea (50F), that's not her real name, for 25 years. We met through college, all that stuff, we married, and we hade 2 kids. About 2 years ago, I was diagnosed with cancer in my left leg, and it resulted on my leg getting amputated. I have to use a prosthetic to walk.

During my recovery, we didn't have much intimacy, as I received exhausting chemotherapy trying to save my leg before surgery was needed. And as I recovered, our intimate life was really damaged, as neither of us made any moves, and when we did, I enjoyed it, but she didn't seem to.

Well, during this time,  new neighbors moved to the suburbs we live on. They didn't live right next to us, just on the same neighborhood. Let's call them Clara and Alex, not their real names. They were a married couple, and they moved here because Alex's parents' health had been declining, so they moved closer so Alex could go there to help them.

Well, Clara and Bea became good friends quickly, apparently, they had ran into each other a few times, and they started hanging out on weekends a lot. I became friends with Alex. Not as much as Bea and Clara did, but sometimes we hanged out to watch a game on free time or go to the bar. In their hangouts, my wife and Clara often went to Clara's house, drank some coffee, talked a lot, read some books they loved, and overly, they were good friends. I know this because early in their friendship, I went to one of these hangouts, I don't know nor think they are the same right now. Great right?

Well, during my recovery process, as I previously stated, we barely have intimacy. It was exhausting and painful to do so. She started spending a lot of time with Clara. I think you can guess what was happening.

Some hours ago, I was walking a bit. Chemotherapy took a toll on my body, but since I need to stay active if I don't want my health declining further, I started walking some months after the amputation. I was walking a bit, and I went out for about an hour. When I came back, I didn't see my wife in our home, and I guessed she was at Clara's. At this hour, Alex is often with his parents during weekends helping them, and my wife is at Clara's. She seemed like a teenager when hanging out with her, all weekends, for hours a day. They became really close.

Well, suddenly, I receive a message, it was from Alex. It said he came to his house to bring something he needed quickly, and he didn't see Clara. They are those people who put cameras everywhere in their house. I helped them install a few if them. He saw the camera on their bedroom to see if Clara was asleep to not do much noise, and... he found Clara fingering my wife and vice versa. I seriously don't know what to do. My wife is back right now, bathed already, cooking dinner downstairs... maybe my low intimacy caused this... but it still hurts.

# My Journey Before MITOLYN

Before I started MITOLYN, my life was a constant struggle with tiredness and low motivation. I‚Äôm a 41-year-old parent and small business owner, and every day felt like a marathon I hadn‚Äôt trained for. I‚Äôd wake up groggy, barely have the energy to get through work, and crash on the couch by early evening. My mind was always foggy, and no matter how healthy I tried to eat or how much I exercised, my weight wouldn‚Äôt budge.

I tried everything‚Äîvitamin shots, fancy shakes, endless cups of coffee, and even those trendy ‚Äúbiohacker‚Äù drinks. Most things made zero difference, except for making my wallet a lot lighter. I remember thinking, ‚ÄúMaybe this is just what getting older feels like.‚Äù

Then, one night while searching for answers online, I found all these stories about MITOLYN. People said it helped them feel young again, with more energy from the inside out. I figured I had nothing to lose and decided to try it.

# What Is MITOLYN, Really?

MITOLYN is a supplement that‚Äôs made to help your mitochondria work better. But what does that mean? Imagine your cells are tiny factories that need energy to run everything your body does‚Äîfrom thinking and moving to digesting food and fighting germs. Inside each cell are mitochondria‚Äîthe ‚Äúpower plants‚Äù that make this energy.

When your mitochondria get sluggish, everything else slows down: you feel tired, your brain gets foggy, and it‚Äôs harder to keep a healthy weight. MITOLYN‚Äôs blend of natural ingredients is made to wake up these power plants and help them work at full strength.

What‚Äôs special about MITOLYN is it doesn‚Äôt just cover up symptoms like low energy or slow metabolism. Instead, it‚Äôs designed to help your cells create more energy naturally by supporting your mitochondria. The formula mixes key nutrients‚Äîlike CoQ10, PQQ, NAD+ helpers, and special herbs‚Äîto deliver a real energy boost where your body needs it most.

# My Results With MITOLYN (Week by Week)

I wanted to be careful, so I started slowly, taking just one MITOLYN capsule a day.

**Week 1:**  
The first thing I noticed was waking up before my alarm, feeling refreshed for the first time in ages. Usually, mornings were the hardest, but suddenly I felt lighter and less groggy.

**Week 2:**  
My afternoon energy crash disappeared. I could focus at work and finish tasks without needing extra coffee. Even my family noticed I seemed more upbeat.

**Week 4:**  
By the end of the month, I was sleeping deeper and waking up energized. I started exercising again‚Äîsomething I‚Äôd skipped for months because I was always too tired. My mood swings were less intense, and I felt calmer even on stressful days.

**Months 2 to 6:**  
Over these months, my energy stayed steady from morning to night. I lost about 13 pounds (without changing my diet much), and my clothes fit better. My skin looked healthier, and my friends kept asking what my ‚Äúsecret‚Äù was. It was honestly just MITOLYN.

**Month 12 (Now):**  
One year later, I feel younger than I have in a decade. My doctor said my inflammation levels were down, and all my latest health numbers looked great. Best of all, I feel like I have my life back‚Äîfull of energy, focus, and excitement for each day.

# Why MITOLYN Works (In Plain English)

MITOLYN works by helping your cells produce more clean, steady energy. Most of us feel tired because our cells are slow at making energy, especially as we age or get stressed.

Here‚Äôs how the key ingredients work, in simple terms:

- **CoQ10:** Like fuel for your cell‚Äôs engines. Helps your heart, muscles, and brain work better.
- **PQQ:** Encourages your body to make *more* mitochondria‚Äîlike giving your cells extra power plants!
- **NAD+ Boosters:** Help fix and protect your cells from getting old and tired too quickly. They‚Äôre like giving your body a tune-up.
- **Rhodiola & Ginseng:** Adaptogens that help your mind stay sharp and your mood stay calm, even when life gets busy.

When you mix all these together, your body feels more alive, your mind is clearer, and you can bounce back from stress faster.

# Who Should Try MITOLYN?

I think anyone who‚Äôs tired of feeling tired should give MITOLYN a shot! Here are some signs it might help you:

- You‚Äôre always worn out, even after a good night‚Äôs sleep.
- You struggle to focus or remember things.
- You gain weight easily, or feel achy and inflamed.
- You feel like you‚Äôre aging faster than you should.
- You just want to enjoy life with more energy and less stress.

I‚Äôve recommended MITOLYN to my family, friends, and even my skeptical neighbor‚Äîmost of them noticed a difference in just a few weeks.

# Pros and Cons (Honest Opinion)

**Pros:**

- Real results you can feel in the first week.
- Made from natural, non-GMO ingredients.
- No weird side effects (at least for me).
- Helps with mood, energy, and metabolism all at once.
- The company is transparent about what‚Äôs inside.

**Cons:**

- It costs more than regular vitamins (but you get what you pay for).
- You can only buy it online (shipping was quick, though).
- You need to remember to take it every day (I set a phone reminder).

# What is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a dietary supplement made to help you feel more energized, focused, and strong from the inside out. What makes MITOLYN interesting is that it‚Äôs designed for people who want to support their health as they go about their busy lives, whether that means working, studying, taking care of family, or just enjoying life. It‚Äôs not just for athletes or people with specific health problems‚ÄîMITOLYN is for anyone who wants to give their body a little extra help to feel great every day.

When I first heard about MITOLYN, I was curious because it promises to help boost energy, support your immune system, and even improve mental clarity. Those are things I think we all could use a little more of! The idea is that by giving your body the right blend of natural ingredients, MITOLYN helps your cells work better, which can make you feel more alive and able to handle whatever comes your way.

# The Power of MITOLYN's Ingredients

One thing that really stood out to me about MITOLYN is its list of ingredients. I‚Äôm always a little skeptical of supplements that don‚Äôt tell you exactly what‚Äôs inside, but MITOLYN is pretty transparent. Here‚Äôs a closer look at what you‚Äôll find in each capsule:

**Mitochondria-Boosting Complex**  
MITOLYN‚Äôs main focus is on helping your mitochondria, which are the tiny power plants inside all your cells. These little guys are what give you energy to move, think, and just be alive. The supplement includes special nutrients and herbal extracts that are meant to help your mitochondria work even better, so you feel less tired and more energetic.

**Antioxidants**  
We hear about antioxidants all the time, but what do they really do? Basically, they help protect your body from damage caused by things like pollution, stress, and even just getting older. MITOLYN uses a mix of powerful antioxidants from natural sources to help keep your cells healthy and slow down aging from the inside.

**Adaptogens**  
Adaptogens are plants and herbs that help your body deal with stress. If you feel worn out or overwhelmed, adaptogens can help you bounce back faster. MITOLYN includes several of these, like ashwagandha and rhodiola, which are known to help balance your mood and help your mind stay clear, even when life gets hectic.

**Vitamins and Minerals**  
Our bodies need vitamins and minerals to run properly. MITOLYN adds in a bunch of these important nutrients‚Äîlike vitamin B12 for energy, magnesium for muscle and nerve health, and zinc for your immune system‚Äîso you‚Äôre not missing out on anything essential.

**Other Natural Extracts**  
MITOLYN also has a few other plant-based ingredients that help with digestion, detox, and even keeping your skin looking fresh. The whole formula is made to work together, so each ingredient helps the others do their job even better.

# The Benefits of Taking MITOLYN

Now, let‚Äôs talk about what you might actually feel if you start taking MITOLYN. I wanted to know if it could really make a difference, so here are some of the main benefits people have reported‚Äîand that I‚Äôve noticed myself:

**More Energy, All Day Long**  
One of the first things I noticed was having more energy‚Äînot the jittery kind you get from too much coffee, but a steady, all-day feeling that made it easier to get things done without crashing in the afternoon.

**Stronger Immune System**  
Nobody likes getting sick. With MITOLYN‚Äôs blend of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, I felt like my body had a better chance of fighting off colds and other bugs, especially during busy or stressful times of the year.

**Sharper Focus and Clearer Thinking**  
Sometimes my brain feels foggy, especially after a long day. MITOLYN‚Äôs adaptogens and nutrients helped me feel more alert and focused, so it was easier to remember things and finish tasks without getting distracted.

**Detox and Digestion Support**  
After a couple of weeks, I noticed I just felt ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù inside. MITOLYN‚Äôs natural extracts seemed to help my digestion, making my stomach feel lighter and less bloated. Plus, my skin started looking a little brighter, which was a nice bonus!

**Healthy Aging**  
I‚Äôm not getting any younger, and I want to age as gracefully as possible. The antioxidants in MITOLYN helped me feel like I was taking steps to protect my cells and keep my body running smoothly, no matter my age.

# Why MITOLYN is a Top Choice for Health Enthusiasts

A lot of supplements promise big things but don‚Äôt deliver. Here‚Äôs why I think MITOLYN stands out and why it‚Äôs become one of my favorites:

**Natural, High-Quality Ingredients**  
MITOLYN doesn‚Äôt use weird chemicals or mystery fillers. Everything inside comes from trusted sources, and there are no artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives.

**Backed by Science**  
The ingredients in MITOLYN aren‚Äôt just trendy‚Äîthey‚Äôre supported by real research that shows they can help your body work better. That gave me confidence that I wasn‚Äôt just wasting my money on empty promises.

**Easy to Use**  
I love that I only need to take a couple of capsules a day, and I don‚Äôt need to change my whole routine. MITOLYN fits right into my busy life without any hassle.

**Positive Reviews**  
Before I started, I read a lot of reviews from other people who had good results with MITOLYN. It‚Äôs always nice to know I‚Äôm not the only one who‚Äôs seen improvements!

**No Nasty Side Effects**  
Some supplements can upset your stomach or make you feel weird, but I haven‚Äôt had any problems with MITOLYN. It feels gentle and safe, which is really important to me.

The blend of natural ingredients, the science behind the formula, and the way it fits so easily into a daily routine make it a smart choice for just about anyone.

# My Journey Before MITOLYN

Before MITOLYN came into my life, things felt stuck. I‚Äôm 41 years old, a parent, and run my own business. My days were filled with tiredness I couldn‚Äôt shake, and by lunchtime, it was like my brain had checked out. I used to joke that I‚Äôd need a nap at 2 PM just to survive the afternoon! No amount of coffee helped. 

Even worse, my weight was slowly climbing, and no matter how many salads I ate or gym sessions I sweated through, the scale just wouldn‚Äôt budge. My mind felt foggy, and sometimes I‚Äôd forget simple things like where I put my keys or what I needed from the store. I tried a bunch of things‚Äîvitamins, expensive drink mixes, and weird diets. They either didn‚Äôt work or made me feel even worse.

I felt like my body and brain were running on empty, and I was desperate for something that would help me feel like ‚Äúme‚Äù again.

# What Is MITOLYN, Really?

MITOLYN is a supplement that says it helps your mitochondria. If you don‚Äôt remember those from science class, mitochondria are tiny parts inside your cells that make energy‚Äîlike little battery packs for your body. When they‚Äôre working well, you have more energy, you think clearly, and your body just works better.

MITOLYN isn‚Äôt just a bunch of random vitamins. It‚Äôs a mix of special ingredients that help those ‚Äúbatteries‚Äù recharge and work at their best. The formula includes things like CoQ10, PQQ, NAD+ boosters, and special herbs. I recognized some of these from other supplements, but MITOLYN puts them all together in a way that targets your energy at the source.

So, instead of just hiding tiredness or drinking more coffee, MITOLYN tries to fix the real problem: when your cells can‚Äôt make enough energy, you feel slow, weak, and foggy. This supplement is supposed to help your cells and, in turn, help you feel strong and clear again.

# My Results With MITOLYN (Week by Week)

When I first started MITOLYN, I was curious but also a bit skeptical. Here‚Äôs how it went for me, week by week:

**Week 1:**  
I started with one capsule a day. Within a few days, I noticed I was waking up before my alarm, and I actually felt rested. That felt like magic to me! My mornings weren‚Äôt as grumpy, and I didn‚Äôt reach for coffee right away.

**Week 2:**  
The afternoon energy crash was gone. I could focus on my work, and I didn‚Äôt get that ‚Äúfoggy brain‚Äù feeling. My family noticed I seemed more upbeat, and I felt less grumpy overall.

**Weeks 3-4:**  
My sleep got better‚Äînot just longer, but deeper. I remembered my dreams, and I didn‚Äôt toss and turn as much. My workouts felt easier, and I didn‚Äôt get so wiped out afterward. My mood was calmer, and even stressful days didn‚Äôt get to me as much.

**Months 2-6:**  
I started losing weight without changing my diet much‚Äîjust about a pound or two a month. My skin looked brighter, and people commented that I looked more ‚Äúalive.‚Äù I felt like I had the energy to play with my kids and finish my work without feeling exhausted.

**Month 12 (Now):**  
A whole year later, I feel better than I did in my 20s. I sleep well, my doctor said my blood work looks great, and I haven‚Äôt had a single ‚Äúcan‚Äôt get out of bed‚Äù day in months. My mind is clear, my body feels strong, and I‚Äôm just happier overall.

# Why MITOLYN Works (In Plain English)

MITOLYN works because it helps your body‚Äôs tiny energy makers‚Äîyour mitochondria‚Äîdo their job better. When your mitochondria are healthy, you have more energy, your brain works faster, and your whole body feels younger.

Here‚Äôs how some of the main ingredients help:

- **CoQ10:** Helps your cells make energy. It‚Äôs kind of like adding fuel to your body‚Äôs engine.
- **PQQ:** Encourages your body to make more mitochondria, like giving your car more engines!
- **NAD+ Boosters:** These help your cells repair themselves and stay young longer.
- **Rhodiola and Ginseng:** These are herbs that help your body deal with stress and keep your mind sharp, without making you feel jittery like coffee can.

All these things work together like a team to help you feel better from the inside out.

# Who Should Try MITOLYN?

If you:

- Always feel tired, even after sleeping
- Struggle to focus or forget things easily
- Have trouble losing weight (even when you try)
- Feel older than you are, or just not like yourself

Then MITOLYN might be a good fit for you. 

I‚Äôve told my friends, my family, and even my neighbor who always complains about being tired. So far, everyone who‚Äôs tried it has noticed some kind of improvement.

# Pros and Cons (Honest Opinion)

1k8u2l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1k8u2l8/sudden_migraine_escalation/,Sudden Migraine escalation,"I‚Äôm experiencing a rather dramatic departure from my usual migraine activity.

For reference, I (34M) have experienced migraines since I was 15. Depending on the year/month, I average one migraine lasting 8-12 hours every 2-3 months. Once when I was 16, I got two migraines on consecutive days. Throughout my mid-20s, there were entire years I didn‚Äôt get a migraine. In my more recent years, I‚Äôve gone back to averaging one migraine again every 3 months or so.

Migraines were historically triggered by cheese and caffeine, however these haven‚Äôt been clear triggers for me since my early 20s. I‚Äôve been able to consume a daily coffee without issues for half a decade now, whereas this previously wouldn‚Äôt be possible as a teenager. Migraines these days tend to be triggered by stressful periods and strong smells, but not with absolute certainty.

My symptoms are fairly classical: clear aura as a warning sign, developing into strong pounding pain across either one or both hemispheres; nausea and vomiting; intolerance of sound, light, and movement. They typically last 8-10 hours before subsiding into a mild movement-aggravated headache.

The departure that I‚Äôm experiencing is this: I‚Äôve had five migraines in a week.

21st April - woke up, had a shower, immediately an aura began. I took my triptan medication and paracetamol, went back to bed, and was mostly fine 5 hours later. Pain was moderate. Nausea moderate.

24th April - migraine started around 1pm. Clear aura developed. Took Triptans and paracetamol. Pain behind the left and right eye socket was moderate. No nausea. Was fine 4 hours later

26th April - awoke with a pounding headache. No aura in vision initially. Pain clearly over the left eye socket this time. Almost resolved within three hours, however, then I started to get an aura to signal a second migraine was coming. The second migraine was whole left hemisphere, with severe pain. This one lasted 5 hours and included lots of vomiting.

27th April (this morning) - awoke to my morning alarm with a mild 1/10 headache. Initially checked my vision for any aura but there was nothing there. Got out of bed and turned on my light, and immediately an aura begins. Took my triptan medications again, and went back to bed. No pain this time. Awoke 3 hours later and am feeling fine again.

This recent history is a massive departure from my long-term history, and also from my usual signs and symptoms profile (no triggers present, different duration, different pain severity, different locations). The only clear similarity is the aura I experience beforehand. This feels like a mix of migraine activity and cluster headaches, but it doesn‚Äôt match perfectly with either diagnosis‚Ä¶?

Any ideas on how I can possibly manage this? I‚Äôm lost and nervous about what this means for me moving forward. I also don‚Äôt want to get myself in trouble with taking triptans too frequently.",2,1745722503.0,migraine,2,1.0,False

1k8tw92,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlogsAtTiffanys/comments/1k8tw92/aileen_wuornos/,Aileen Wuornos,"Preface: They labeled Aileen America‚Äôs first female serial killer though she was neither the first or the worst. Though she did have a ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù approach to homicide most would say. She is suspected of at least seven murders and sentenced to die in four out six of those cases that she confessed to police. She did insist that some, if not all were done in self defense, resisting violent assaults from men she solicited while working as a sex worker. Though, only one case was shown where her story may have been true.  

Aileen was born Aileen Carol Pittman in Rochester, Michigan on February 29, 1956. Her teenage parents separated months before she was born. Her father Leo Pittman moving on to serve time in Kansas and Michigan as a deranged child molester. He committed suicide by hanging himself in prison. Her mother Diane Pratt recalls Aileen and her brother as ‚Äúcrying, unhappy babies‚Äù, and that caused her to abandon them with her parents in 1960. On March 18, 1960 Aileen‚Äôs maternal grandparents Lauri and Britta Wuornos legally adopted the children. 

Aileen‚Äôs childhood showed little to no improvements there. By six she had suffered scarring burns to her face when she and her brother were setting fires with lighter fluid. Aileen later disclosed to police she slept with her brother at a young age but friends say otherwise and he is unable to speak for himself as he passed in 1976. Aileen however was having sex with someone since she became pregnant at 14. Although, by 11 she was prostituting herself out at school to students for drugs, cigarettes, and food. She had her son on March 23, 1971. She gave him away in a closed adoption. On July 7, 1971 her grandmother died, although it was suspected to be liver failure Diane believed it to be her father of murder. Diane claimed her father threatened to kill her and her kids if they weren‚Äôt removed from his home. 

Aileen and her brother at that point became wards of the court. Aileen dropped out of school to work the streets full time as a teenage sex worker drifting across country. In May 1974 Aileen was using the alias ‚ÄúSandra Kretsch‚Äù she was jailed in Jefferson County, Colorado for disorderly conduct, drunk driving, and firing a .22 caliber pistol from a moving vehicle. Additional charges were added for failure to appear. Back in Michigan on July 13, 1976 Aileen was arrested in Antrim County for simple assault and disturbing the peace after throwing a cue ball at a bartenders head. She also had outstanding warrants in Troy, Michigan for driving without a license and consuming alcohol in a motor vehicle. On August 4, 1976 Aileen settled her debt of $105 to society. 

The money came indirectly from her brothers death on July 17, 1976  his death left her with a life insurance payment of $10,000. Of which Aileen wasted in two months on luxuries. One of which was a new car she wrecked pretty quickly. Finding herself broke again nearing late September she hitchhiked a ride to Florida. It may have been a change of scenery but she was still Aileen and the law was still the law. 

On May 20, 1981 Aileen was arrested in Edgewater, Florida for armed robbery of a convenience store. Aileen was sentenced to prison time for this on May 4, 1982, being released 13 months later on June 30, 1983. Her next arrest on May 1, 1984 was for trying to pass forged checks at a bank. On November 30, 1985 she was named as a suspect in the theft of a postal and ammunition in Pasco County. She used the alias ‚ÄúLori Grody‚Äù from an aunt in Michigan. 11 days later Florida Highway Patrol cited Aileen (posing as Grody) for driving without a valid license. On January 4, 1986 Aileen was arrested in Miami as Aileen, for auto theft, resisting arrest, and obstruction with false information. The police found a .38 caliber revolver and a box of ammunition in the stolen car. On June 2, 1986 Volusia County detained Aileen posing as Grody for questioning after a male friend of hers accused her of pulling a gun on him and demanding $200. Despite her refusal of the situation Aileen was carrying spare ammunition and a .22 pistol was hidden under the seat she was in in the car. Aileen created a new alias ‚ÄúSusan Blahovec‚Äù she was ticketed for speeding in Jefferson County, Florida. Her citation included ‚ÄúAttitude poor. Thinks she‚Äôs above the law.‚Äù. 

This is when Tyria Moore met Aileen in a gay bar in Daytona. They quickly became lovers but the passion faded over a year, they remained friends and traveling companions. They became inseparable over the next four years. On July 4, 1987 police detained ‚ÄúSusan Blahovec‚Äù and ‚ÄúTina Moore‚Äù for questioning on suspicion of hitting a man with a beer bottle. ‚ÄúBlahovec‚Äù (Aileen) was alone with a patrolman cited her for walking on the interstate and possessing a suspended license on December 18, 1987. Once again her citation read ‚Äúattitude poor‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlahovec‚Äù proved it over two months with threatening letters letters mailed to the circuit clerk on January 11 and February 9, 1988. 

A month later Aileen had a new approach and alias. On March 12, 1988 ‚ÄúCammie Marsh Greene‚Äù accused a Daytona bus driver of attacking her, claiming he pushed her off the bus following an argument. Tyria Moore was listed as a witness to the incident. On July 23, 1988 a Daytona landlord accused Moore and ‚ÄúBlahovec‚Äù of vandalizing their apartment, ripping out carpets, and painting the walls dark brown without approval. In November 1988 ‚ÄúBlahovec‚Äù made a six day attack of threatening calls against a Zephyrhills market, over an incident with lottery tickets. 

By 1989 Aileen was just belligerent and erratic. She never took an insult lightly, she would go out of her way to provoke arguments, and always had a loaded pistol in her purse. She would hang out at bars and truck stops, hitchhiking rides to snag a sex work deal when all else failed. So she used theft to supplement her sex work income. More and more with Tyria she talked about all the wrongs in her life and wanting revenge. 

Richard Malloy, victim one. A 51 year old electrician from Palm Harbor. He was last seen alive by coworkers on November 30, 1989. His car was found abandoned at Ormond Beach the next day, his wallet and papers nearby, several condoms, and a half bottle of vodka. On December 13, 1989 his fully dressed corpse was found in the woods north of Daytona shot three times with a .22 pistol. In searching for a motive police discovered he‚Äôd been divorced five times, and had the reputation of being paranoid, a heavy drinker, and very much into the porno/topless bar scene. He had no criminal record though despite being described as mental. 

The investigation stalled on June 1, 1990 when a nude victim was found, shot six times with a .22, and dumped in the woods 40 miles north of Tampa. By June 7, the corpse had been identified by dental records as 43 year old David Spears, last seen leaving his job in Sarasota on May 19. Spears planned on visiting his ex in Orlando that afternoon but he didn‚Äôt make up. His boss saw his missing pick up on May 25, but then the trail went cold. 

By the time Spears was identified the third victim had shown up. Charles Carskaddon, 40, was a part time rodeo worker from Booneville, Missouri, missing since May 31. He vanished along I-75 on his way to meet his fianc√© in Tampa. His naked corpse found 30 miles south of the Spears murder site on June 6. He had been shot nine times with a .22 pistol. This suggested a pattern even to those who resisted the idea of a serial killer at large. On June 7 Charles car was found in Marion County, a .45 semiautomatic and personal items were stolen from the car. 

Peter Siems, 65, a merchant seaman turned missionary was seen last on June 7, 1990. He left his Jupiter, Florida home to see family in Arkansas. When he never arrived a missing person report was filed on June 22. No trace of him had been found by July 4 when his car was wrecked and abandoned in Orange Springs, Florida. Witnesses described the occupants of the car as two women one blond and one brunette. The blond was injured and bleeding and police were able to life a bloody palmprint from the vehicles trunk. 

Eugene Burress, 50, left the Ocala sausage factory where he worked to make his delivery rounds on July 30, 1990. A missing person report was filed when he hadn‚Äôt returned by 2am the next day and his delivery van was found two hours later. On august 4 his fully dressed body was found by a family picnicking in the Ocala National Forest. He had been shot twice by a .22 pistol in the back and chest. Nearby police found his credit cards, receipts, and an empty cash bag from a local bank. 

Dick Humphreys, 56, was a retired Alabama police chief who had been employed by the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services to investigate child abuse claims in Ocala. His wife filed a missing person report when he failed to return home from work on the night of September 11, 1990. He was found the next day in an undeveloped subdivision, shot seven times with a .22 pistol his pants pockets turned inside out. On September 19 his car was found abandoned and stripped of plates behind a service station in Live Oak. It was impounded on September 25 and not traced back to Humphreys until October 13, the same day his badge and other belongings were found in Lake County, 70 miles southeast of the murder. 

Walter Antonio, 60, a trucker from Merritt Island who doubled as police reserve for Brevard County. Found in the woods northwest of Cross City on November 19, 1990,  he had been shot three times in the back and once in the head. He was nude but for his socks, his clothes were later found in a remote area near Taylor County. His car was found in Brevard County on November 24. Police said that his killer had stolen a distinctive gold ring along with his badge, nightstick, handcuffs, and flashlight. 

On January 16, 1991 Aileen summoned detectives and confessed to the six killings, allegedly done in self defense. Within two weeks of her arrest her attorney had sold the rights to her story for a movie. A bizarre sideshow of media became about this case which is why I left some details out. Aileen was given the death sentence and maintained her innocence that it was all self defense till the end. After nine years on death row Aileen stopped all her appeals. In April 2001 she asked them expedite her process on death row. Even in one interview recanting her self defense approach to the case. The state Supreme Court approved her decision to fire her attorneys on April 1, 2002. She was executed by lethal injection six months later on October 9, 2002. She declined her last meal, only asking for a cup of coffee. Her last words were ‚ÄúYes, I would just like to say I‚Äôm sailing with the rock, and ill be back, like Independence Day, with Jesus.‚Äù.

Nearby police found his credit cards, receipts, and an empty cash bag from a local bank. 

Dick Humphreys, 56, was a retired Alabama police chief who had been employed by the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services to investigate child abuse claims in Ocala. His wife filed a missing person report when he failed to return home from work on the night of September 11, 1990. He was found the next day in an undeveloped subdivision, shot seven times with a .22 pistol his pants pockets turned inside out. On September 19 his car was found abandoned and stripped of plates behind a service station in Live Oak. It was impounded on September 25 and not traced back to Humphreys until October 13, the same day his badge and other belongings were found in Lake County, 70 miles southeast of the murder. 

Walter Antonio, 60, a trucker from Merritt Island who doubled as police reserve for Brevard County. Found in the woods northwest of Cross City on November 19, 1990,  he had been shot three times in the back and once in the head. He was nude but for his socks, his clothes were later found in a remote area near Taylor County. His car was found in Brevard County on November 24. Police said that his killer had stolen a distinctive gold ring along with his badge, nightstick, handcuffs, and flashlight. 

On January 16, 1991 Aileen summoned detectives and confessed to the six killings, allegedly done in self defense. Within two weeks of her arrest her attorney had sold the rights to her story for a movie. A bizarre sideshow of media became about this case which is why I left some details out. Aileen was given the death sentence and maintained her innocence that it was all self defense till the end. After nine years on death row Aileen stopped all her appeals. In April 2001 she asked them expedite her process on death row. Even in one interview recanting her self defense approach to the case. The state Supreme Court approved her decision to fire her attorneys on April 1, 2002. She was executed by lethal injection six months later on October 9, 2002. She declined her last meal, only asking for a cup of coffee. Her last words were ‚ÄúYes, I would just like to say I‚Äôm sailing with the rock, and ill be back, like Independence Day, with Jesus.‚Äù. 

If you would like to please feel free to check out my other blogs or just feel free to comment what you know about Aileen!

Hi! I‚Äôm Stephanie. I‚Äôm 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I‚Äôd like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I‚Äôd be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I‚Äôm not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won‚Äôt jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/bIhpl9X)

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages. 

Ice breaker question! What is the best movie or tv show that you‚Äôve watched recently?

I read some posts with people trying to work out if it was worth it. I can say at least at this point it is definitely not. We have stayed club level at the Portofino and the Hard Rock Cafe. In both cases they were so much better. 

let me list the reasons why you should not stay club level: 

1) The club is on the freeway side not the parkside so no view. I find this very odd given where Disney concierge is placed in their deluxe hotels in a way which emphasizes the view.
2) The gentleman at the door just completely ignored me for 15 minutes as I was trying to get in. He was just playing at his computer. 
3) The coffee machine only seemed to dispense vanilla coffee. I asked one of the attendants whether or not it could be fixed and she said no  have no idea how to fix it.
4) She also emphasized that the coffee machine was only programmed to have coconut milk. 
5) The club level lounge visual appeal is of a very tragic break room as a paper company in Scranton PA. There were just some very uncomgotable chairs and no sense of luxury whatsoever. Overlooking the freeway with  employees you clearly did not want to be there. 


I think in the end the club level at universal is very very rarely worth it, but out the Helios it is so not worth it. I hope this helps someone else. I had been hoping that by booking club level it might be better than at the other hotels, but it was so much worse!

Hello! Help a student out, huehue.

My groupmates and I are beginners. I think we are missing a step or doing something differently in making paper with corn husks, coconut husks, and banana fibers. Based on the comments in this sub, it seems we've been doing it differently. Can you guys help us figure out what the problems are in our process and why we can't produce good paper? Mostly, it looks like cardboard, or the paper breaks easily.

Here's our process:

1. We shred the fibers with a coffee bean grinder to cut them into small pieces or pulverize them.
2. We boil the fibers in a pot with a mixer. The only additive we use is baking soda (I guess we thought it could be an alternative to a blender?).
3. After some time, we transfer the boiled fibers into another basin with water and cornstarch combined. Sometimes, we just use water.
4. This is where it gets tricky: we put fabric inside the deckle and do the molding process.
5. We press the fibers with another fabric on top (like a sandwich), then put some flat, heavy materials to remove the excess water.
6. After that, we remove the top fabric and proceed to dry the paper directly under the sunlight.

After lurking in this sub, I found out that it should be soda ash. Also, do I need to soak the fibers overnight first? Help us, please! Any recommendations and tips are much appreciated.",1,1745720297.0,papermaking,4,1.0,False

Other posts will be from inflammatory responses and cycles as I've researched them in regards to some of the terms below relating to inflammatory markers. It's hard to split these as they blend so much and so many potential factors bleed into one another and everyone has their own unique sequence of scenarios.  While I recommend attempting to stick to a whole food plant based diet - this is just a storyboard of information and potential scenarios with a bias towards gout, serum uric acid, etc. 

Below you will occasionally see ""search: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"" which you can search to see the results I got as there is so much more info available. 

Gout is far more complex than someone saying to avoid seafood, alcohol, and beef as I'm sure you're well aware of. Unfortunately, you have to read labels, look for ingredients you can't pronounce, are highly refined, and redefine your pallet and intentionally eat healthier or deal with many hidden aspects of hyperuricemia or go the route of ULT meds. My hope is to help folks see the deep relationship between our food and our health. You'll also notice most studies will talk about the positive impact of some food/dietary means and how they hope to replicate it in medication.

\*\*Supplements may have their place but the idea is to source these things from whole foods.

6. Conclusions and perspectives: The results of epidemiological and experimental studies on high-fiber dietary intervention both indicated beneficial improvements of clinical and microbiome outcomes. Gut microbial ecology is largely regulated by the human diet, especially available component, and high fiber intake has been associated with elevated levels of Prevotella \[[132](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590097822000209#bib132)\].

This above (Prevotella and other bacteriums) is an insane rabbit hole and needs more research.

Searched ""What is cereal fiber""

Cereal fiber refers to the indigestible parts of cereal grains like wheat, oats, and rice, that are part of the outer layer of the grain called the bran. These fibers, including beta-glucan, arabinoxylan, and cellulose, are a type of dietary fiber that offers various health benefits, particularly for digestive health and reducing the risk of chronic diseases. \[[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3708330/), [2](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/when-it-comes-to-fiber-cereal-fiber-may-be-your-best-choice-201102251535), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7599874/#:~:text=Whole%20grains%20of%20cereals%20and%20pseudo%2Dcereals%20are,e.g.%2C%20cellulose%2C%20arabinoxylan%2C%20%CE%B2%2Dglucan%2C%20xyloglucan%20and%20fructan.&text=Cereals%20are%20an%20important%20source%20of%20dietary,dietary%20fibre%20intake%20in%20Western%20countries%20[30].), [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3145818/#:~:text=Cereal%20fibre%20and%20whole%2Dgrain%20intakes%20have%20been,including%20obesity%2C%20CVD%20and%20type%202%20diabetes.&text=Commonly%20used%20cereal%20grains%2C%20including%20wheat%2C%20maize,rice%2C%20are%20major%20sources%20of%20insoluble%20fibre.)\] 

I do old fashioned organic oats most mornings with raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, and occasionally strawberries - and add a few raisins and 1.5 tbsp chia seeds. 

Compare¬†this to enriched flour which is found in many snacky foods that are shelf stable - many of these metabolize quickly and can be stored as fat because of the sugar spike and the way your liver can't handle all that sugar at once.¬†

Whole grains and CRP

This title seems misleading as it states in the article: ""Consumption of whole grains was significantly and inversely associated with hs-CRP concentrations across the menstrual cycle in this cohort of young, healthy women. Furthermore, women who consumed ‚â•1 serving/d of whole grain had a significantly lower probability of having a moderate or elevated hs-CRP categorization (based on AHA criteria). The associations remained significant after adjustment for various other demographic characteristics, metabolic variables, and dietary factors. These results highlight the benefits of even moderate whole grain intake as part of a healthy diet. Furthermore, this association raises the possibility of using whole grains as a potential, effective intervention to protect against the adverse reproductive outcomes associated with elevated hs-CRP in reproductive-aged women.""

""Moderate evidence supporting cardiometabolic protection resulting from flavan-3-ol intake in the range of 400‚Äì600¬†mg/d was supported in the literature. Further, increasing consumption of dietary flavan-3-ols can help improve blood pressure, cholesterol concentrations, and blood sugar. Strength of evidence was strongest for some biomarkers (i.e., systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and insulin/glucose dynamics). It should be noted that this is a food-based guideline and not a recommendation for flavan-3-ol supplements. This guideline was based on beneficial effects observed across a range of disease biomarkers and endpoints.""

AI Overview: Excessive sugar intake, particularly fructose, is linked to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and can increase C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, a marker of inflammation.¬†The liver processes fructose, and high fructose consumption can lead to fat accumulation, contributing to NAFLD.¬†Elevated CRP, often associated with liver inflammation, can be a consequence of this fat buildup.¬†

""In conclusion, NAFLD is the most common cause of chronic liver disease and is strongly associated with the metabolic conditions of insulin resistance, T2D, and obesity. The increasing prevalence of NAFLD is linked to the rise of sugar consumption; therefore, dietary strategies incorporating restriction may provide an effective disease prevention and treatment solution. While the role of dietary sugar in NAFLD pathogenesis is still being elucidated, current consumption levels surpass the World Health Organization's guideline of no more than 10% of total energy intake. Given the health and economic impact of NAFLD, it's crucial to reduce free sugar intake to alleviate the current burden and prevent future obesity-related comorbidities.""
