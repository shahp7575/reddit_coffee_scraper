I can pinpoint the exact minute it started, though I wouldn‚Äôt have realized it then. Tuesday, 11:57 a.m. I was standing on the corner of Main and Sixth, waiting to cross the street, when I noticed the woman with the red scarf. There was something odd about her‚Äînot odd enough to stop my day, but enough to catch my eye. She had this blank, empty look, almost as if she was waiting for someone to wind her up again.

The light changed, and she crossed the street, disappearing down Sixth Avenue. Just another pedestrian in a city that eats up people by the thousands. I forgot about her in minutes.

Then it happened.

‚Äú11:57 a.m.‚Äù

A text popped up on my phone, and my brain jolted with a flash of familiarity. I‚Äôd just checked the time, hadn‚Äôt I? A strange sensation settled in, a kind of buzzing in the base of my skull. I looked up, and there she was. The woman with the red scarf, standing across the street, staring blankly into space.

I blinked, shook my head. Maybe it was a trick of memory or some odd d√©j√† vu. I chalked it up to sleep deprivation. Who really pays attention to clocks, anyway? I crossed the street, ignoring the creeping unease that had wrapped around me like a fog.

‚Äú11:57 a.m.‚Äù

The sound of a car horn blared, jerking me out of a daze. I glanced at my phone.

11:57 a.m. again.

My breath hitched. It was impossible. This was a bad dream, or maybe I‚Äôd fallen asleep on my feet. The woman with the red scarf caught my eye again, and she looked right at me this time. It wasn‚Äôt blank, the look she gave me; it was almost‚Ä¶apologetic.

I started to sweat. The light turned, and she walked across the street. But something was different‚Äîan odd rhythm, a mismatch in the way her shoes hit the pavement. It was a beat too slow, like she was pulling against invisible strings. I didn‚Äôt cross. I just stood there, frozen, until the light cycled back.

‚Äú11:57 a.m.‚Äù

Panic flared. My heart beat like a wild animal in my chest. This was insane. This wasn‚Äôt just d√©j√† vu anymore. No, I was trapped, or haunted, or maybe just losing my mind.

I glanced around, half-expecting to see people pointing and laughing, but nobody even looked at me. I couldn‚Äôt do this again. I turned on my heel and ran, as if I could outrun time itself. I ducked into a coffee shop, gasping for air, my mind racing. Coffee, I thought. Caffeine. Clarity.

But when I reached for my wallet, my hand froze.

‚Äú11:57 a.m.‚Äù

There‚Äôs a point when fear gives way to resignation, and I hit that point at least six loops in. I became numb to the sight of the red-scarf woman and the blare of that car horn. The only thing that changed was me. My heartbeat slowed, and I grew a little less frantic.

I tried talking to people, but nobody heard me. The barista didn‚Äôt blink when I asked for a coffee. I spoke louder, until I was shouting. Nothing. I felt like a ghost, wandering a city that couldn‚Äôt see me. Each loop, I became more invisible.

It‚Äôs remarkable how quickly the mind starts to make bargains with itself. Maybe this wasn‚Äôt hell, I thought. Maybe it was a test, or some cosmic prank. The thought gave me a kind of courage. I tried to manipulate things: I walked into traffic once, just to see if I could change the outcome. I didn‚Äôt feel the impact, only a blinding flash, then‚Äî

‚Äú11:57 a.m.‚Äù

I started to think of the red-scarf woman as a constant, a landmark in the shifting landscape of my reality. She was the only thing that stayed the same, the one piece that never shifted or changed. Once, I even stood in her way, but she walked right through me like mist, her apologetic look lingering as she passed.

That‚Äôs when I began to wonder if she was trapped, too.

I don‚Äôt know what drove me to try, but one loop, I took a deep breath and shouted, ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù as loud as I could. To my shock, her eyes flickered, almost like she‚Äôd heard me. And then she spoke, though I don‚Äôt think her lips moved. It was more like her voice was in my head.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù she said. Just that. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

That was it, and I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that she meant it.

I tried everything after that. I followed her. I walked where she walked, copying her every movement, hoping to break whatever spell was keeping us here. But every time, no matter what I did, the clock would reset, and I‚Äôd be back at the corner of Main and Sixth, staring at that cursed red scarf.

Days‚Äîor were they hours?‚Äîpassed. I lost track. My mind splintered, stretched thin over a thousand identical minutes, each one looping back on itself like a snake eating its own tail.

Until one loop, she wasn‚Äôt there.

‚Äú11:57 a.m.‚Äù

I blinked. My surroundings blurred, sharpened. My hands felt oddly heavy, like I‚Äôd been carrying a weight for hours. I looked up, and the woman was gone. Relief coursed through me, a lightness I hadn‚Äôt felt in what felt like lifetimes.

I took a tentative step forward, half-expecting some unseen force to stop me. But nothing happened. The world around me was sharp and real. The car horn blared, the light changed, and I crossed the street, my steps echoing in the quiet morning air.

I reached the other side, half-expecting to be dragged back, but the clock kept ticking. 11:58, 11:59‚Ä¶

And then, as I took a shaky breath, noon struck.

I don‚Äôt remember much after that, only that I wandered the city in a daze, savoring the simple act of moving forward. The weight of those minutes lingered, pressing down on me, as if I‚Äôd been hollowed out by the repetition.

I never saw the red-scarf woman again. I don‚Äôt know if she escaped, or if she‚Äôs still trapped in that endless loop, crossing the street forever at 11:57 a.m., a prisoner of time.

As for me, I keep a wary eye on clocks, always glancing down, half-expecting the hands to betray me. And every time I see a flash of red in a crowd, I feel my heart skip, a pulse of fear quickening in my veins.

It's been almost 3 months since the break up, and 2 months since I last saw him. My (31F) ex (31M) moved to another state temporarily and we agreed to go NC for two months, but with intention of hopefully being friends one day, not necessarily ever getting back together. In these two months, I have drastically improved in terms of my emotional state and am now at the point where I no longer miss being in a relationship with him, but I miss having him in my life. He was my best friend for 2.5 years.

We reached out yesterday and have exchanged a few texts. It's really nice to talk to him, but it's been weird in terms of realizing how different we are right now. He hasn't really worked on himself yet (not like I expected it, he's got some extenuating circumstances), but his inability to articulate a few things about his emotions weirdly confirmed a lot for me about the nature of our relationship. He's also not in as great of a place as I was expecting, which is surprising considering he's the dumper. I think it has also helped me realize that the problems that led up to the breakup had less to do with me and more to do with him. If I was the entire problem, then removing me from his life would have a greater net positive, right?

It's bittersweet. It's nice to establish brief contact (we're going to see each other for coffee after the holidays pass, and only be in brief contact a few times until then), but I think I'm also sad because the fact that he hasn't started actually getting the help he needs so badly, and that I would want him to get if I ever considered getting back together with him, isn't happening.

I wasn't expecting to have the small hope of rekindling (that I didn't realize was still there) dashed right off the bat, if that makes sense. I know I would weirdly be less sad if he said he had a new girlfriend or something. I guess I'm just venting, but has anyone else had this experience with talking again and it being surprising?",1,1729980005.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

We‚Äôve been no contact ever since and I got blocked everywhere,"I‚Äôve always been an overachiever, and while I‚Äôve had a lot of success, it came with sacrifice, solitude, and pain. She came into my life at one of my lowest points, when I was battling major setbacks and pushing myself to get through. It was the hardest time of my life, filled with feelings of worthlessness and anxiety over failure.



I was working 80-hour weeks to rebuild, and one day, after a long year of hardship, I saw her in a coffee shop. She was the most beautiful girl I‚Äôd ever seen. Her smile, her eyes‚Äîshe was better than anything I could imagine. I fell in love without even realizing it and started going to that coffee shop every day, hoping to see her. Just the sight of her filled me with joy.



When we finally got to know each other, I instantly knew she was my soulmate. We‚Äôd talk for hours, about anything and everything, and I couldn‚Äôt imagine my life without her. She softened me, gave me a place to be vulnerable, and taught me to believe in love. She made life feel brighter in ways I‚Äôd never known.



Over time, I learned she had her own struggles‚Äîa chronic illness, infertility, a fractured family. None of it deterred me; I wanted to be with her, no matter what. But in the later stages of our relationship, her mental health started to decline. She developed an eating disorder and intense anxiety, became suicidal, and would have bouts of anger. I understood that it was probably her illnesses talking and not her. I tried to help, even found her a therapist and paid for him, but it became overwhelming. I loved her deeply, but I didn‚Äôt know how to save her. 



As things grew harder, I began to feel distant. We fought often, and finally, after a particularly bad fight, she ended things. I tried to get her back, but she blocked me everywhere. Later, her friend told me not to reach out because she was in so much pain, she might hurt herself. I still called her once, just to hear her voice, but it was clear she wasn‚Äôt ready to talk. I remember the pain in her voice.¬†

Five months later, I am still healing. I love her still but had no solution to her troubles.I recently noticed that she blocked me on Apple music 2-3 weeks ago for some reason (even though I never stalked her music page or haven't tried to contact her at all).

This relationship left me shattered. I loved her, but I couldn‚Äôt save her. Now, even though I am in a really good place and have what I once prayed for, I don‚Äôt have her to share it with. I can only love her from afar, hoping she finds peace.

I wish none of you ever have to know what this feels like.

Our shop takes all forms of payment, aside from cash or checks, so there‚Äôs always a printed receipt after every purchase and our policy is to get a signed copy.   Maybe it‚Äôs just me, but I‚Äôve always thought this kind of thing was common and expected for businesses to do.  The signed receipt acts as physical proof the purchase was made and, in my opinion, prevent cases of identity theft.  This kind of stuff happens a lot at my workplace and when we don‚Äôt have a signed copy, we‚Äôre forced to refund everything.

At least once or twice a day, I end up ringing up someone who has some level of resistance towards signing their receipt.  Like it‚Äôs an inconvenience to them and *we‚Äôre* the dumb ones for doing it.  

Here‚Äôs a few examples just from this week:

-One guy I served this week claimed he shouldn‚Äôt have to sign since ‚Äútapping the card meant I agreed to the payment‚Äù and then called our policy stupid when I asked what would happen if someone else used his card instead of him.  

-Another person outright refused to sign when my coworker asked, saying it was ‚Äúhis right not to sign.‚Äù  

-One woman laughed and said ‚ÄúPeople still need these things?!  They probably won‚Äôt even look at it.‚Äù

Other than those encounters, most people just act a bit confused or weirdly defensive about it.  Like, I feel like they think I‚Äôm trying to do something bad, when I‚Äôm just doing what my business wants.  And what my business wants, in my honest opinion, makes logical sense to me.

As title says I want to understand a lot of things about coffee, be mindful I have a learner's mind and every tip is hugely appreciated, sorry to those which will find this as basic or too newbie to start but I hope to learn as much as possible for those willing to share!

1. The only thing I posses to do coffee is Drip Coffee machine, and I enjoy the Black coffee that comes out of it, I live in Panam√° and darn how much I enjoy it! Normally I drink Geisha coffee from over here, but if somebody has tasted from Chiriqui - Boquete over here or anything I can order from outside in America (US as well) similar to this, I'm willing to purchase and taste!

2. I want to have a machine, as I want to be able to do Espressos, Capuchinos, Lattes, Machiatos, Affogatos, all of them, I'll be getting in touch with all of them, I have went to stores over here and I see the machines some having a lot of features, some being very small and showing pressure indicators, what should I be looking to start doing Espressos at least? is 200 bucks a good budget to start? If possible I'm willing to spend 400 for a great machine which will allow me to experiment all brews and will last 5+ years but I'm advocate on starting to learn form the very beginning

  
3. Different to the machine, I have seen filters such as V60's, Chemex, Aeropress and Japenese Siphon, which one of those can I start purchasing based on affordability (no need for numbers just a ranking) and If I love a strong body, very aromatic coffee which of these can produce this more?

  
4. Which youtube channels can you recommend in order to learn about barista skills? I met a guys that in a Panamanian Conquest finished second and when I asked him for courses I could take told me to not get scammed and learn by himself on the internet just as he did, the guy works in a coffee place which is my opinion is still unmatched in terms of roast, aroma, body, everything, therefore I believe those skills just as everything else can be learned with self education and wanted to ask for references and resources from you guys

5. I have noticed some places give me burned black coffees, americanos and espressos, all bitter with no real body, why is that? I know very likely it is matter of a lot of things but which could be the main reasons and how to avoid it when have let's say my own espresso machine?

My long time close friend is pregnant and I am really struggling with how insensitive she has been with my infertility. My husband and I have been ttc for 4+ years and she is aware how much I have struggled with it and that I am currently in therapy because of it.

Earlier this year, we were on a coffee date and she expressed to me that she was frustrated as her boyfriend wasn‚Äôt ready to have kids yet (for context, they had been going through a rocky patch and had just decided to move out together for the first time). She even went as far as comparing her boyfriend‚Äôs lack of desire to have kids with my infertility, saying things such as ‚Äúat least your husband wants kids‚Äù. I was a little taken aback as I don‚Äôt think that makes my infertility any easier to deal with, just because my husband wants children, too?! 

Fast forward a month and she tells me she‚Äôs pregnant, that the condom must have broken and says ‚ÄúI feel so bad for you guys that I got pregnant first go on accident and you have been trying for so long‚Äù. That comment stung but I brushed it off as I thought, you know what, maybe she doesn‚Äôt realise that it was kind of rubbing it in my face a little?

Throughout her pregnancy, she has sent me unsolicited scan pictures and messages about her symptoms despite knowing that I have come off social media because I was struggling to deal with pregnancy announcements. When I have seen her in person, she has said things like ‚Äúlook how big my bump is getting now!‚Äù I have tried so hard to push my own feelings aside and be there for her through an exciting time in her life, and especially as her boyfriend really struggled to adjust to the impending baby as it wasn‚Äôt something he felt was on the cards yet. It was crazy that I, her friend with infertility issues, was having to console her because her boyfriend was struggling to accept that they were having a baby when it is all me and my husband could possibly want.

I do feel that I have put aside my feelings as much as I possibly can to provide support, but I feel like she has absolutely zero regard for my feelings and would even go as far as to say, I don‚Äôt think she even cares. I have worried about her feelings and about coming across as the miserable friend who can‚Äôt get pregnant, and now I‚Äôm thinking to myself, what for?! She couldn‚Äôt give a damn about how I feel.

I had to start distancing myself from her for my own mental health as the awful feelings it was stirring was making me feel unwell and the struggle of infertility was becoming even more unbearable with what felt like her constant bragging. She has always been a bit of a flaky friend as she makes plans and cancels them last minute ever since I have known her, so to be honest, I‚Äôm not even entirely sure she has noticed I‚Äôve been distancing myself.

She is now in the late stages of her pregnancy and is having her baby shower next week and I just don‚Äôt think I can face it. I‚Äôm afraid that I will burst into tears in the middle of it and it‚Äôs full of strangers who I have never met before, so it will not be a comfortable setting for me, and I just can‚Äôt sit there playing baby games and pretending to be okay when she hasn‚Äôt given a single thought to my feelings. 

I have decided I am not going and will be telling her I have the flu, but why do I feel SO guilty for not going even though she has been so insensitive towards me?

Would you go to the baby shower if you were in my shoes? I feel that by not going, I am making a statement and she will feel that I should be there and that I am being selfish by not going as I am her closest friend (for further context, she doesn‚Äôt have many friends and I actually have never heard of any of the people who are going apart from her mom and her boyfriend‚Äôs mom).

We‚Äôve been on base 5 months no issues.

We have automatic orders from my meals, my babies meals and a toy subscription for him and coffee for my husband.

Last week I placed a huge lululemon order which came back undeliverable because it wasn‚Äôt coming UPS it was some place I never heard of.

I contacted Lululemon who said they got some new set up and that they couldn‚Äôt control how it came but that an algorithm would pick the cheapest shipper and it would send that way.

Which I thought would be an isolated moment.

Until‚Ä¶ last week my babies food didn‚Äôt come. We contacted and they had implemented this same bizarre arrangement‚Ä¶

And then my own food order from an entirely unrelated company said the same thing they had picked up this new method or algorithm the exact same month as all these very separate companies using 3rd party shippers.

Infact as of today‚Ä¶ 6 additional orders of 6 different companies have all failed and we‚Äôre going to get a UPS box.


But I‚Äôm just wondering was something new made or put out? What gives?

5 months or consistent shipping and now it‚Äôs like every company out there is using Veho, UniUni or this weird 17track thing?

What are these weird shippers?

I've always thought that if we were in different places in life we'd probably date, yet I didn't have active feelings for him. I never felt like we flirted with one another. I had no idea he had feelings for me until now.

He told me that he's in a solid marriage. (He's talked a little about his wife before and a lot about his adult children.) He expressed that his wife wouldn't like him spending time with me outside of work. But he wants to find time to spend together outside of work like going to a cafe.

Before this, he's invited me out for drinks with other colleagues a few times and invited me for coffee once outside of regular work hours. I've never gone due to timing. We have been out to lunch one-on-one during work hours a few times.

Is he really just looking for sex? He's never come across as the type to do that. Anyone else been in his position and can give me more perspective? How would you respond if you were in my position?

I just want one singular irl friend to talk to. I want to hear about anothers persons day when we go out for coffee in town or watch a movie together. I want someone to see something funny and think ""hey i'll send it to [my name]"" and I'll respond with a moment back.

My house is in the middle of nowhere and can't drive so there's very little group meets for things I'm into.

I'm autistic and struggle with new people or groups which makes everything even harder. And it doesn't help there's always people who will clock me as ""odd"". 

I've tried travelling to the nearby city to join in a card group and nobody wanted to actually talk to me. They were either rude or too busy playing with their own friends. The meeting was an hour and half bus ride so I felt even worse going home. 

I've tried making friends at work and people would rather talk to anyone else. One guy has spoken to me once and decided he dislikes me. All I did was ask the name of his dog.

I've tried joining dis.cord groups and I get ignored every single time. All I say is ""Hi"" and it's like I don't exist.

I tried joining an online a dungeons and dragons group and it did not end well. Like horrible. 

My ex tried bringing me along to things with their friends or we would go to conventions or travel, I miss doing things with someone. Not romantically just having a person there who likes to be with me.

1gcvc4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1gcvc4y/hinge_mess/,Hinge mess,"I'm struggling and it's long and complicated to explain but I'd appreciate some advice/ guidance. 

I'm married, been with that partner for 16 years total though this relationship has had its ups and downs, we get by and manage well enough. My husband spends a lot of time away with his LD partner, trying to split his time equally between us. 
I have another partner (Bug) we are about to celebrate our 2nd anniversary. We hope to be together for the long-term and talk about what our future holds often. This is the relationship I am struggling with. We had some early hinging issues which has caused a big rift, and I really want to not feel anything negative about it anymore. 

So... Bug has another partner, Kitty. We had some issues in the beginning because I didn't want lots of things shared about me with Kitty, I have a number of mental health conditions that I didn't want shared due to previous experience of stigma from metas. But unfortunately Bug was unsure what to say about me and therefore did not say anything. Kitty kept pushing Bug for information, stating it harmed their mental health to not know anything about me, which Bug shared with me a few times. I eventually got frustrated with Bug telling me this so I told them to tell Kitty whatever they want.

Being told about Kitty's anxiety then set off my own anxiety. I started to have panic attacks, thinking Kitty might be talking about me behind my back (which I guess she was in a way, but I didn't need to know about it üòÇ). I started to get paranoid that Kitty might turn up on our dates or at Bugs house when I'm there because Kitty wanted to know when Bug and I were having dates. Bug told me that Kitty requested more messaging from them when Bug is with me due to Kitty's anxiety and Bug then started to text Kitty in front of me. Kitty also often calls Bug when they are with me, and Bug always answers.
I'm trying to be mindful that Kitty has physical and mental health issues and leans on Bug for quite a lot of support but it sucks that it's often at the expense of our (limited) time together. I feel hurt that Bug leaves during our dates to answer the phone. I think it's fine when we're together for extended periods of time (more than one night) but I'm frustrated that on shorter dates they still answer the phone etc. 

At one point (maybe 6 months ago?) Bug really wanted Kitty and I to meet, because they felt once we met that both of our uncomfortableness with each other would go away... I didn't really want to do it but I felt pushed by Bug (and Kitty to an extent, though I think this was projection because I knew she was anxious about me which made me anxious) so I did it. It actually made things so much worse (lol duh). 
I really struggled with it because I went straight into fawn mode, I was quiet and aloof. We did not have anything in common. Kitty and I have opposite personalities and we just really didn't gel together. Kitty felt rejected. Afterwards, I was wholly annoyed that I did something I didn't want to do. Bug also did not offer any aftercare, despite me asking a number of times to talk about what I'd need. Bug went home with Kitty and I went home alone and then Bug didn't check in with me until the next day even though I'd messaged asking for support. 

Since that meeting, things have been more strained. Bug thought a WhatsApp group would be a good way for the 3 of us to communicate to maybe overcome the hurt. They added all 3 of us a group, and WhatsApp helpfully auto-titled the group to just their 2 names... I admit I did not handle this well. I was already feeling put out by the amount of emotional labour I felt I was doing to support Bug and Kitty's relationship. I was incredulous at this and left the group until the name was changed. Since then, the group has been ok. We occasionally share memes or Bug will send us updates of what they are doing in their partner free time. 

I want to get to some kind of neutrality but not sure how. I'm open to feedback and any points for reflection about my own behaviour. I recognise we have all let anxiety drive the car to an extent and that has tainted how this is being managed. I'm resentful and frustrated and angry, and it's difficult for me to hear Kitty's name (but we still talk about them in mostly positive ways because I don't want to just pretend they don't exist). I'm trying so hard to see it from the other perspectives but I really just want uninterrupted dates with my partner!!! I've tried to offer Bug hinging support and resources but it hasn't had an impact.

Bug says they find it hard to manage when I share that I am upset and immediately think that I want to end the relationship. I have always approached these talks with care and reminders that I love them but that I am unhappy with the situation. I have reassured them that I want to work at this but I need them to demonstrate that's what they want too, by making decisions and following through.
I have said I'm just going to end dates and go home when Bug answers the phone to Kitty during our shorter dates (unless it's an emergency) because it's so disruptive. I've asked if they want to tone down our relationship to make room for their relationship with Kitty and they said No. I have suggested that we stop having overnight dates and just do dinner/coffee dates for while (thought that might help if they had shorter ""protected"" time??) or just instead plan weekends together only to see if that helps their scheduling. They don't want to do any of these suggestions!

I had also offered to meet Kitty 1:1, as I thought it might be easier for me to manage than the group meet was (this offer was extended probably 4-5 months ago). Kitty said yes initially but has had major health and general life issues that meant it hasn't happened. I'm not sure I feel interested anymore, I feel the moment has passed. I was only doing it for Kitty and Bugs sake anyway and I think that I just want to go back to being parallel now.",1,1729977977.0,polyamory,4,1.0,False

1gcv87s,https://www.reddit.com/r/dryalcoholics/comments/1gcv87s/thoughts_after_35_years_sober/,Thoughts after 3.5 years sober.,"Hey.

First off, I'm sort of just journaling here. Please no medical advice. Although I would appreciate any wisdom, solidarity, or perspective folks here can offer especially in terms of how I relate to myself in the context of AUD and sobriety.

My drinking history was probably significantly shorter and maybe not as intense as a lot folks here. Not at all trying to compare, justify, or overreact to my drinking. Essentially, I was blackout drunk every day for like 3 years with a month off after about 2.5 years. No failed relationships, no lost jobs, no hospitalizations or organ failures, no yellow skin/eyes. I stopped cold turkey 3.5 years ago due to uncontrollable anxiety. Had a rough withdrawal period and high anxiety stuck around unfortunately.

Anxiety was always there with me. My baseline is higher than normal folks, but the drinking did something to me mentally because after I quit it was more severe and I was having awful panic attacks. My doctor put me on a low dose SSRI for the anxiety and another low dose medication for insomnia. These 3.5 years have been up and down in the anxiety department. The medication helps, and most of the time has been good but I get stuck in these periods where it becomes uncontrollable and all-encompassing. I'm currently in one of those hard periods.

My wife has some difficult (but not life-threatening!) medical stuff going on, and my anxiety has been creeping upward the last couple of months. I had a horrendous panic attack a few weeks ago, and 10 days ago I decided to go 100% caffeine free (which is hard because I'm in love with coffee).

Caffeine withdrawal (lol, I know) has been rough but I'm feeling better nowadays. At least, in terms of headaches and the depression that comes along with caffeine withdrawal. The last two days I've been getting a sensation in my abs (or on my skin, can't quite locate exactly where it's coming from) that feels like the area is on fire. It's strange because it actually doesn't hurt, it's just a burning sensation. Burning muscles can be a sign of anxiety, and I exercise probably too much so I'm trying not to overreact or freak out too much, but it's been hard. Will be checking in with my doctor when I can because I've never experienced burning in/on/around my abs before. (Now if you have had this before and it was totally benign, you can let me know. Otherwise, no horror stories please).

So what's the point in all of this? Well, every single rough period I have with anxiety reminds me of when I first stopped drinking. And it makes me feel like I'm right back there. Obviously not in terms of my relationship with alcohol, but in terms of my anxiety and my relationship with myself.

There's a profound self-hatred, shame, and regret I carry with me for my drinking. I just can't let it go. And there's the voice that tells me what I'm going through with anxiety now is my fault and I asked for this. Most of my anxiety is health anxiety, so even though my heartrate and blood pressure is low, all labs I've had in the last 3.5 years were good, two EKGs were normal, a doppler of my aorta was normal, and an MRI for a lump showed it was just a benign cyst that did end up going away, I still struggle with the thought that I cannot get away with drinking as much as I did with nothing more than anxiety. That three years of drinking was short, but I really went at it hard in that short amount of time. And I think that's the crux of my recent anxiety issues: all the tests in the world aren't convincing me that my body is fine, and all the support and understanding of my beautiful wife hasn't been enough for me to mentally move on. At this point, I don't know what to do.

Apologies for the novel, but I'll end with some lessons that I learned in my 3.5 years of sobriety:

1. Recovery is forever. I don't know if I'll ever put all of this behind me.
2. Sobriety has given me the tools to deal with problems. My problems are numerous, but I'm sober and can address them head on.
3. I'm an addict through and through. If it's not alcohol, it's coffee. If it's not coffee, it's tea. And if it's not tea, then it's..... ? Haven't replaced my coffee/tea yet though I'm searching for a caffeine-free, allergen-safe, preferably hot beverage to enjoy. Thought about Coffig but read about figs potentially having pollen that can cause allergic reactions and got turned off by that.
4. Support is essential. I'm probably the most introverted person on the planet and would be totally ok living life 100% alone. But my wife has been my saving grace, and even if I would be ok being along it wouldn't be good for me at all. Finding that support from a beautiful woman who is also introverted is the greatest thing this life has ever given me.
5. Life can get better. But you have to do something about it. Time doesn't fix anything, action does.
6. and playing off of lesson 5: I have got to figure out what the hell to do with this anxiety and with my perception of self. Because this isn't working.",4,1729977667.0,dryalcoholics,0,1.0,False

Advice and experience requested,"I‚Äôll get right to the point. I was taking anabolics and added too much weight too quickly on the squat bar pushing for a benchmark. For a couple sessions I would wrap my painful knee and finish my sets. I was training with a 4/10 pain and it would go away over the next day or two. Meanwhile I was working a job on my feet that involved long shifts without breaks and constant walking. I quit the weights and over the next 2-3 months of working, my knee got worse and worse until I couldn‚Äôt walk anymore. I had to get on short-term disability and total rest figuring I‚Äôd be back in a month. 

I never got better. I actually got worse. My knees would ache so bad by the end of the day in a way that was somehow worse than when I was training and working. This progressed beyond the typical complaints of a dull ache, pain going down stairs, etc. to a knee that is so sensitive that I‚Äôd get a sharp pain in my knee if I stepped wrong and be in pain for days after. I‚Äôd rest and rest and it would seem to get better and then come back a few days later.

MRI was pretty unremarkable, just mild lateral Hoffa‚Äôs pad edema, mild lateral patellar tilt, and minimal patellar tendinopathy. Nothing that my ortho thought wouldn‚Äôt go away with rest. Cartilage and everything else looked good. I figured I just had really inflamed my soft tissue and was hopeful that in a few months I‚Äôd be back into life.  

I have tried every conservative treatment as well as peptides. Cortisone did nothing. My knee is so fragile that when I tried wall-sits the other day I caused a 4-day flare-up. Then I tried the touchdown single-leg squat on 1 plate height and it triggered a 2-day flare-up. I can only tolerate very mild glute / hip movements, which I have done with no apparent help for my injury. I was on crutches so long that now my other knee hurts from compensating. Oftentimes it‚Äôs difficult to carry out daily activities. I take the mobility scooter when I shop or just order grocery pick-up. I haven‚Äôt done anything social in many months. My relationship ended. I used to love life and be a positive person who loved being active and loved my job. Now I‚Äôm becoming depressed. I just turned 35 and didn‚Äôt even celebrate. I‚Äôm not a dramatic person but every day I cry quietly, regretting my decision to overtrain.

Does anyone know how fucked I am? I consulted with one ortho surgeon who said I had patellar femoral pain syndrome and dismissed me. I‚Äôm meeting another surgeon soon. I lost all my muscle which was sadly part of my identity and I feel ashamed and small. I‚Äôve always been very thin with long limbs but with years of hard work bodybuilding I built a physique that received many compliments. I don‚Äôt leave the house anymore unless I have to and I pray that I don‚Äôt see anybody I know as I limp around. I‚Äôm back living at home and I mostly stay in my room shamefully knowing that I caused this by overtraining and taking anabolic drugs like an idiot. It was small dose, oral only cycle, during which my lipids were a little elevated but my bloodwork returned to normal. Despite the idiotic drug use, I am a health freak (whole foods only, strict bedtime, 0 smoking or alcohol, etc.) yet cannot get over this injury.

I don‚Äôt even know what my diagnosis is. Mild ‚ÄúHoffa‚Äôs pad syndrome‚Äù co-occurring with some PFPS and possible patellar tendinosis? I know that after surgery I may never be the same. I lived for weightlifting but now I just want to be able to go out and get a damn coffee and walk without pain. The next step is the arthroscopy. I know there are no guarantees in surgery, but are my chances for improving any good? What might the surgeon spot while inside my knee that is causing me to be in this state of disrepair? It hurts to drive, oftentimes it hurts to walk, I can‚Äôt go down stairs, and most PT causes a flare-up. And it hurts if I tap my kneecap lightly or even put blankets on it sometimes, like there‚Äôs a bruise on it.

1gcv2ts,https://i.redd.it/wk094bnh26xd1.jpeg,Weird smell coming from countertop,"Hello! Here as a last ditch attempt effort before we go to our landlord.

About a week ago my fianc√© came home and immediately smelled something weird in the kitchen when he walked through the archway. I had just barely finished deep cleaning the house in preparation for some friends coming over for dinner and a movie night. 

I hadn‚Äôt taken out the garbage yet, so I took it out and lit a candle thinking nothing more of it. But, as time went on this smell never went away. My fianc√© can smell it the most, and I can only occasionally. I work from home, and I have a poor sense of smell anyway, so I assumed I was just nose blind to it.

We spent all of last week deep cleaning the kitchen in search of the source of this smell. We cleaned out our pantry, the fridge, cleaned the garbage and recycling bin, cleaned out the cupboards, and even pulled out the oven and cleaned under and the sides of the counter. We replaced the drip pans and heating elements thinking some food spilled and burned while cooking. The smell won‚Äôt go away!

We‚Äôve tracked the smell to this countertop. If I put my nose right up to it, I can smell it. My fianc√© can smell it just walking into the kitchen. I‚Äôd describe it plasticky, and my fianc√© describes it as musty. This specific countertop is the biggest and most accessible countertop in our small kitchen. So almost everything gets done here. From making coffee in the morning, to prepping dinner at night. It all gets done right here. So it makes sense that if we spilled or damaged something in the kitchen, it‚Äôd be here. 

Once we found the source, I deep cleaned the coffee maker, changed out the oil in the dispensers, and put my nose up in every crevice of this area in the kitchen. We can only smell it from this specific countertop. Also, that white thing you can see under the countertop is a pull out cutting board that we never use. We also pulled that out and cleaned it. (Please note that crockpot is not usually on the counter, that‚Äôs just the zuppa I‚Äôm cooking tonight for dinner)

We decided to try baking soda. We covered the counter in baking soda and left it over two nights. When the baking soda is on the countertop, you can‚Äôt smell it. But once we vacuumed it up the smell came back overnight. We are losing our minds!

We can‚Äôt think of what caused this smell, or how to get rid of it. I‚Äôd bet this countertop is pretty old. I know the house hasn‚Äôt been renovated in anyway in at least 7 years. But, do countertops degrade in such a way? I believe this is a laminate countertop. 

On a daily basis I use the all purpose Meyers cleaning solution on all countertops in the kitchen and have ever since we moved in 3 years ago. No other countertops have this weird smell. I‚Äôve purchased a Lysol brand kitchen cleaner with hydrogen peroxide instead of bleach as an attempt at a heavier duty cleaner. I‚Äôm scared to use anything with bleach as I don‚Äôt want to cosmetically damage the counter. 

I forgot to mention that before trying the baking soda we cleaned it with a white vinegar solution with no luck. 

Any ideas as to what could‚Äôve cause this smell, and how to get rid of it?? Or is this a common thing? I couldn‚Äôt find anything similar when googling it. We don‚Äôt want to tell our landlord before trying everything in our power to fix it. She‚Äôs not the worst landlord, but a little judgy and IDK what she‚Äôll do to help us.

1gcusm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1gcusm9/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the caf√©s. Even the caf√©s can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a caf√©, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a caf√© wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their caf√© and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local caf√© can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

1gcuocb,https://www.reddit.com/r/trustyconsumer/comments/1gcuocb/what_i_learned_about_ecofriendly_packaging/,What I Learned About Eco-Friendly Packaging Legislation From My Dad‚Äôs Shop,"Hey, everyone! So, the topic of eco-friendly packaging legislation is one that hits really close to home for me. My dad runs a small grocery store in our town, and let me tell you, the changes over the last few years have been quite the rollercoaster.



The other day, I was helping him stock shelves (because what else are kids good for, right?) and it struck me how much we‚Äôve all learned about sustainability from the new laws. I remember when the biggest concern was making sure the brown paper bags didn‚Äôt split open under the weight of canned beans. Simpler times.



Anyway, when the first wave of eco-friendly packaging legislation hit, my dad was kind of skeptical. He had the usual worries of a small business owner, mainly that the costs would crush him, or that the alternatives simply wouldn't hold up. Plus, there's the effort involved in finding new suppliers and adapting to new systems.



But my dad is nothing if not persistent. He decided to dip his toe in the cautiously green waters with compostable bags for produce. The initial feedback was a mixed bag (pun totally intended). Some customers loved it, boasting how they were reducing their carbon footprint, while others lamented that the bags felt flimsier than their predecessors.



The great surprise, however, was that within a few months, people adapted. It's like they suddenly realized, ""Hey, this isn't the worst thing in the world."" Or maybe they just enjoyed their veggies being all smug and zero waste. Over time, we noticed an interesting trend: the buzzword eco-friendly became almost as important as the buzzword organic. Turns out using eco-friendly packing isn‚Äôt just a necessary evil; it‚Äôs a selling point!



And for my dad, the initial fears about cost were mostly unfounded. Sure, the packaging is a bit pricier, but folks in our community seemed understanding and were willing to pay the negligible extra for the peace of mind that comes with saving the planet, one biodegradable wrapper at a time. Our supplier even reported an increase in these kinds of orders, which drove the prices down further as things became more mainstream. It's one of those rare instances where consumer demand actually drives good change. Who knew?



Speaking with my mom, who's always been more of the glass-half-full type, she pointed out that the legislation brought our community closer. The shop sometimes feels like a forum where ideas are exchanged, and people share their journeys about minimizing waste. We‚Äôve gained loyal customers who enjoy being part of our mini eco-mission. Turns out, the secret ingredient in all this packaging isn't just cornstarch or bamboo‚Äîit‚Äôs community.



Of course, it's not all rainbows and sunshine. Challenges exist too. Some suppliers still lag in sustainable practices, making it crucial to do some investigative work. Also, although there are biodegradable options available, they aren‚Äôt quite perfect testing grounds. There have been times supposed eco-friendly utensils ended up looking like sad, warped spoons in the summer heat. (That's what I call a hot mess!)



And then there's the legislation itself, which can be a maze of jargon and exceptions. A coffee shop down the street, owned by Dad's golf buddy, was nearly fined for using paper cups because they didn't have the right certification stamp on them. Ruthless, right? It‚Äôs a learning curve for sure, and the fine print can be a nightmare. Thank goodness for Facebook groups and forums offering tips and tricks.



Kids, like my little nephews, seem to find this whole eco-friendly transition pretty cool though. They love turning the shop visits into tours, as if it‚Äôs some mini environmental school. Plus, they have a habit of running around chanting, ‚ÄúEco-friendly!‚Äù much to the amusement (and occasional annoyance) of the adults. It's like a little green worm that planted itself in the next generation's psyche. I see this as a positive step since they're the ones who will inherit the Earth we leave behind.



So yeah, if you‚Äôre in this boat, know that it's not all sinking bills and inconvenient lawsuits. Sure, eco-friendly packaging legislation can be daunting at first, but it's packed with potential benefits and learnings. For me, it‚Äôs thanks in part to those darn biodegradable bags, half of which I‚Äôm sure have ended up as soccer balls at some point in time. My dad‚Äôs little shop has turned into a beacon of what‚Äôs possible with a bit of perseverance and heart.



For all the personal and shared challenges, it‚Äôs become a mission we didn‚Äôt know we signed up for, and it has brought our community even closer. Who would have guessed that sustainability, with its quirks and perks, could be so... relatable?",1,1729976085.0,trustyconsumer,0,1.0,False

I have a coworker that works similar shifts as me at the factory I work at. We live about 2 miles apart and recently his car broke down.  He asked for a ride for the ""next week or two"" until they got it fixed. I said of course and not to worry about gas money since it's not that much extra for me and they have a car to fix.

It has now been 6 weeks (Tuesday  starts week 7) and the car still isn't fixed. There have been a list of reasons, mostly money issues.  I understand he's poor and has a few kids at home. We make the same so I know money has to be tight. 

The first week they asked about carpooling even after their car was fixed. I said no, I like my time alone in the car before and after work. Also it does change my pre-work routine and cuts down on time with my girlfriend(about an hour total a week).  They just kept talking about how I should think about it and it will benefit us both. 

In the last 6 weeks lots of annoyances have popped up. His coffee thermos leaks. It rolls around on my floor leaving drops of coffee. My car now smells like it and I hate coffee. I asked he put it in a bag, he does about half the time without me reminding/bringing a bag. Since our breaks are the same he sits in my car, I like being alone on break, this has ruined my breaktime. He has also left early multiple times because he's sore and the(unpaid) time off is offered. He sits in my car for hours while I work, drinking/spilling coffee, then says he doesn't have money to fix his car. He also hasn't offered gas money again and it feels rude to ask when I told them not to worry about it initially. 

This is where I feel like an asshole.  I want to tell them after this coming week I won't give them a ride anymore.  There is no real reason I can't, I just don't want to. I want my normal pre-work routine back, and to be left alone on break. I know they are going to ask for another week after that because rent will be due.  I honestly want to say no, point to the times they left work early, and tell them too bad.  That tactic seems rude but I feel like the one more week will turn into a month like now. 

So would I be the asshole if I say no more rides after this week, and hold them to it?",26,1729976011.0,AmItheAsshole,22,1.0,False

1gcumaa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gcumaa,Apartment Layout. ,"Hey everyone!

I‚Äôm trying to figure out the best way to arrange my new apartment, and I‚Äôd love some input. My current idea is to place my desk and entertainment center on one wall with the couch facing them. However, some people on Reddit have suggested flipping the layout‚Äîputting the couch along the opposite wall and the TV/entertainment center across from it.

Here‚Äôs my situation:

- Wall Space: The main wall I‚Äôd like to use for the couch is around 156 inches long. I‚Äôd like a large-ish couch that uses up most of this space, so I can stretch out and have enough seating for multiple people when friends come over.
- Entertainment Center Size: My entertainment center isn‚Äôt huge, and it fits best on the side with the desk. This way, I could have both in one area without things feeling cramped.
- Desk Setup: I work from home and need a dual monitor setup (one vertical, one horizontal), and my desk is about 5x2 feet. I‚Äôd prefer not to put the desk in my room since I‚Äôll be spending a lot of time working there, and separating work from rest areas is important to me.

I‚Äôve attached a blank template of my floor plan with measurements and would love any ideas, suggestions, or sketches for how to arrange everything (couch, coffee table, desk, entertainment center, etc.). I‚Äôm stuck between making sure it‚Äôs practical but also comfortable and spacious for hosting.

1gculni,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/1gculni/why_are_the_powers_eidolon_gets_so_incredibly/,Why Are The Powers Eidolon Gets So Incredibly Limited In Scope?,"When I first read Worm, it was super weird to me that Eidolon never attempted to Tinker. Decided he had the intelligence of a golf ball, and moved on. But recently, the thought came back to me, and now I realize that it's a much bigger issue than just ""why never ever tinker?‚Äù For someone who can have ""any three powers, each way stronger than average"", Eidolon barely appears to use \*any\* power category, and absolutely not in actually synergistic ways. Pathetic does not begin to cover it.

So, I got in a mood to go through in detail.

**Mover:** Okay, so you portal people to Endbringer fights on occasion. Why don't you give everybody in the fight flight as one of your powers, and also a short range emergency teleport to get out of the way as a secondary safety? Why don't you send your enemies into space or a different dimension?

**Shaker:** You tried to freeze some of Leviathans water. That's a start. Why didn't you get two more shaker powers to create redundant effects to dominate and control the battlefield? If the battleground is such a bad city to defend, why don't you get three Labyrinth or Vista abilities and morph to landscape into the perfect terrain? If you can have three shaker powers, why can your enemies move a finger, and why does your allies struggle to get anywhere?

**Brute/Striker:** Dude, just any combination of close-range powers. You ever gave being Alexandria-Clockblocker-Lung a shot? In addition, have you really had your powers this long, and never gotten a Brute power that left you at least a little bit permanently better afterwards? That‚Äôs a common enough theme that I feel like it should‚Äôve happened at least once.

**Breaker:** The number of people you can save by changing the laws of physics might be physically impossible to calculate.

**Master:** Triple Nilbog-tier master powers. Show up to battles with three armies worth of meat shield goliathas, strike team snakes, simian rescue teams, tactical communication birds, and monstrosities capable of triage and first aid. It's pretty straightforward, feel like you should give it a shot at some point.>!Also, you are the  
one who told the Enbringers to fight you. Ever tried telling them to stop?!<

**Tinker:** Buddy, you get powers appropriate to the situation, naturally switching out over time. Just sit down with three tinker powers, keep going with three other tinker powers, and finish up with a final three. Make stuff so far above what one or two tinkers could do that it seems wrong to compare. Be a dozen times better than the second best tinker in the world.

**Blaster:** Alright, you're at least trying here, but I detect a disappointing lack of beneficial effect stacking. You can get three powers at once, let me see at least some exponential results here.

**Thinker:** You are \*waaay\* too out of the loop for someone who canonically had the thinker-capability to know Doctor Mother was playing you. Also, for someone who can be three social thinkers at once, I'm really confused how you've managed to garner a reputation for being uncharismatic.

**Striker:** Clockblocker froze an endbringer for several minutes. Foil could harm them. Panacea could terraform planets. Give me something, here.

**Changer:** Why is it so special that Lung went Leviathan size one time? Why haven't you tripled his record by now?

**Trump:** Words fail me. The things you could achieve. The things you could allow \*other people\* to achieve. The amount of cheating you could do by creating effects that last longer than you get to keep the power! Mindboggling.

**Stranger:** Why was Echidna a fight? Like, please explain this to me. Even if you can't just fry her brain with three top tier sensory noise abilities annihilating her mind at once, at least make it so she has no idea what's going on and she and her clones can't effectively communicate. It'd help a lot.

In addition, just start every morning with food made with inhuman skill and ability. Give yourself supernaturally good coffee. Have energy and enthusiasm unimaginable by human minds the whole rest of the day. Grab a thinker power that lets you schedule beyond mortal comprehension, giving you plenty of time to destress and relax. Solve world issues with an afternoon of reflection. And I don‚Äôt know why someone so obsessed with getting stronger seemingly never paid any mind to powers which will have an effect long after you stop using them.

Get yourself a basement full of clones that will awaken and take your place when you die.

Quality of life things.

TLDR: For someone who can get three powers of above-average quality, he sure doesn‚Äôt seem to be the best at anything, let alone three times the best at anything.

1gcullr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1gcullr/just_saw_a_boomer_repost_this_on_facebook/,Just saw a boomer repost this on Facebook. :/,"After our daughter of fifteen years of age was moved to tears by the speech of Greta Thunberg at the UN the other day, she became angry with our generation ‚Äúwho had been doing nothing for thirty years.‚Äù

So we decided to help her prevent what this girl on the TV announced, while wearing her synthetic clothing with plastic buttons, of the ‚Äúmassive eradication and the disappearance of entire ecosystems.‚Äù

We are now committed to giving our daughter a future again, by doing our part to help cool the planet four degrees.

From now on she will go to school on a bicycle, because driving her by car costs fuel, and fuel puts emissions into the atmosphere. Of course it will be winter soon and then she will want to go by bus, but only as long as it is a diesel bus.

Somehow, that does not seem to be conducive to ‚Äúhelping the Climate.‚Äù

Of course, she is now asking for an electric bicycle, but we have shown her the devastation caused to the areas of the planet as a result of mining for the extraction of Lithium and other minerals used to make batteries for electric bicycles, so she will be pedaling or walking, which will not harm her or the planet. We used to walk or cycle to school too.

Since the girl on TV demanded ‚Äúwe need to get rid of our dependency on fossil fuels‚Äù and our daughter agreed with her, we have disconnected the heat vent in her room.

The temperature is now dropping to 12 degrees in the evening, and where we live will drop below freezing in the winter. We have promised to buy her an extra sweater, hat, tights, gloves and a blanket.

For the same reason, we have decided that from now on, she only takes a cold shower. She will wash her clothes by hand, with homemade soap, and a wooden washboard, because the washing machine is a power consumer; and since the dryer uses natural gas, she will hang her clothes on a clothesline to dry.

Speaking of clothing, the ones that she currently has are all synthetic, so made from petroleum-based products. Therefore, on Monday we will take all her designer clothing to the second-hand shop for recycling.

As for fleecy garments and hoodies, dressing gowns and blankets, these generate more micro-plastic pollution in the ocean than any other garments! Wool only, so out they go as well.

We have found an eco-store where the clothing they sell is made from only naturally dyed, or natural and unbleached silk, linen, wool, bamboo, and jute or hemp. It shouldn‚Äôt matter whether it looks good on her or that she is going to be laughed at, dressing in colourless, bland clothes without an underwire bra ‚Äî that is the price she has to pay for the benefit of the climate.

Cotton is out of the question, as pesticides are necessary in its production, and it has to be transported long distances, often internationally. It‚Äôs very bad for the environment.

From now on, at 7 pm we will turn off the Wi-Fi and we will only switch it on again after dinner for two hours. In this way we will save on electricity, so she is not bothered by electro-stress and will be totally isolated from the outside world.

This way, she can concentrate solely on her homework. At 11 o‚Äôclock in the evening, we will pull the breaker to shut off power to her room, so that she knows that dark means really dark. That will save a lot of CO2.

No longer will we be going to faraway holiday destinations, as they are inaccessible by bicycle. Since our daughter fully agrees with the girl on TV that the CO2 emissions and carbon footprints of her great-grandparents are to blame for ‚Äúkilling our planet‚Äù, what all this simply means is that she has to live like her great-grandparents, and they never had a holiday, a car or even a bicycle.

We haven‚Äôt talked about the carbon footprint of food yet. Zero if it‚Äôs home-grown.

Zero CO2 footprint means no meat, no fish and no poultry, but also no meat substitutes that are based on soy (after all, that grows in farmer‚Äôs fields and requires pesticides and machinery to harvest the beans, trucks to transport to the processing plants, where more energy is used, then trucking to packaging /canning plants, and trucked once again to stores) and also no imported food, because of the negative ecological effect.

And absolutely no: chocolate from Africa, no coffee from South America and no tea from Kenya, India, or Asia.

Only homegrown: potatoes, vegetables and fruit that have been grown in natural soil because greenhouses and hydroponics run on boilers, piped in CPO2, and artificial light. Apparently, these things are also bad for the Climate. We will teach her to grow her own.

Bread is still possible, but butter, milk, cheese and yogurt, cottage cheese and cream come from cows and they emit CO2. No more margarine and no oils will be used for the frying pan, because that fat requires palm oil from plantations in Borneo where rainforests once grew.

No ice cream in the summer. No soft drinks and energy drinks, as the bubbles are CO2. She wanted to lose weight and the sugar production, bottle and can processing are problematic as well, so that will help her to achieve her goal here as well.

We will also ban all plastic in our home because it comes from petroleum and requires C02-producing activities to process it. Everything made from steel or aluminium requires metallurgical coal and must also be removed.

Have you ever seen the amount of energy a blast furnace consumes, or an aluminium smelter? Uber-bad for the climate!!! No car or driving lessons for her either.

We will replace her 9600-coils, memory-foam pillow-top mattress, with a jute bag filled with feathers, straw and a horsehair pillow.

And finally, she will no longer be using makeup, shampoo, cream lotion, conditioner, toothpaste and medication, just like her female ancestors did before Climate Change made her angry at us for destroying her future.

In this way, we will help her to do her part to prevent mass extinction; if she truly believes she wants to walk the talk of that girl on TV, she will gradually accept and embrace her new way of life.",2,1729975858.0,BoomersBeingFools,6,0.75,False

I'm trying to cut energy drinks from my routine because the caffeine messes up my sleep, which I‚Äôm really not a fan of. The problem is, I enjoy having a cold, iced drink in the evening, and plain iced water doesn‚Äôt quite do it for me. I thought I could switch to iced coffee or tea, but that just puts me back in the same caffeine cycle.

Recently, I tried Crystal Light Lemonade as an alternative, and it‚Äôs actually working well. However, I‚Äôm curious about any long-term health effects it might have. I only drink at most one 24 oz tumbler a day, maybe 4-5 times a week, so I know it‚Äôs probably better than energy drinks, but I still want to be cautious. My ultimate goal is to break this habit altogether, but for now, cutting out energy drinks is my first step.

I average about 7500 steps a day if I‚Äôm not active on my off days, much more on my days on 15000+ 

As of now majority of my sugar intake comes from milk and sugar with morning coffees, rice, and complex carbohydrates. Looking to see what simple long term changes those of you in similar situations have made. Already looking at refining my diet and bringing home cooked meals to work to help balance my levels. Potentially switching to just cold brew with no added sugars etc. 

Making it a force of habit to up my aerobic exercise on my off days, although that can be hard with sleep schedules. 

Obviously no cheat sheet way to go through with living a healthy lifestyle but wanting to get some input from those of you who have been monitoring and making changes over an extended period to see what changes work well

My husband is probably the only one that knows ANS understands the extent of my childhood wounds. A lot of people I'm friends with (I hate that English has no good word for ""kole≈ºanki"") - women I got to know, at times we get a coffee, a play-date with kids, or go out to drink and/or dance. Anywhere from small comments (I'm not from a good home, we were very poor, 8 people lived on 33 sqm, my brother is batshit crazy) to more ""spicy"" details (alcoholic father, abusive brother, another one with a tendency to introduce sex concepts to younger siblings, depressed/violent/victimized mother). Some, like 2 know more, they share some experiences but fortunately not as many, less severe and they grew up more functional and able to recognize their needs and grow. 
My husband's knows pretty much everything, as much as I remember. He's compassionate, but very persistent and craves connection - he forced his way to know this much. To the point, life with me is not a picnic. Maybe one organized at an active volcano, where there's still some grass and daisies, but it's rumbling, you get occasional rocks hitting the blanket and guests and sun is frequently coveted by the smoke. He's still an optimistic guy, serving sausages bbqed on lava streams. Most of the time at least - food is great but we need run, and I'm like ""ooh, look at this chocolate cake!"". 
In any conflict, he's the one who talks, no matter who's fault is it, what are the details, he's almost singlehandedly guiding to a solution. It's a painful process for me, I find it both difficult to talk and listen (if I'm the one who hurt him). We just had one of these. And at the end he was mourning my childhood and the person I never got to become, the happiness and love that are passing me by everyday. That he's hurting, but can't be mad. That he loves me and would be a fulfilled man, if one day I will feel true happiness and trust. As I listened to him, I felt this bubbling soup of negative feelings- anger, blame, shame, impatience. I truly wanted him to shut up, to push him away and get out. I was bother by his sincerity, his compassion (I don't want one, I don't DESERVE one), his hope and in-depth understanding. I just layer there, tears dripping. I'm ashamed by how much he loves me, I'm jealous of it and frightened by it. This compassion is heavy. And I hate myself for it, thus I don't want it even more.
Anyone can relate? This authenticity feels worse than sweet lies.
Important edit- I complain a lot, just the level of details and importance are adjusted. I'm always posing as the victim, having explanations for my doings. Some complaints are justified, some are just my coping mechanics  I'm not bothered by the kind of compassion I get as a result. ",1,1729975602.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

TLDR: Was healthy until June 2024, one day woke up with symptoms, tests made condition worse with no clear diagnosis. Seeking advice or similar experiences. Suspect IBS-C or motility disorder

Please offer any advice or experiences as I‚Äôve run through 5 GI docs and 2 naturopathic docs all who said there‚Äôs nothing more they can do for me. Symptoms started at the beginning of June 2024 (listed below). I have had the following tests, all negative or ‚Äúnormal‚Äù results, except one of the upper endoscopies showing ‚Äúesophagitis‚Äù.

Tests done:
-Upper Endoscopy (normal - mild lactose intolerance, though I don‚Äôt normally have issues with dairy)
-Abdominal CT scan with contrast (normal)
-HIDA scan (normal) 
-Gallbladder ultrasound (normal) 
-MRI Enterography (normal - the Breeza prep f*cked with my digestion greatly though) 
-2nd Upper Endoscopy (esophagitis - no grade mentioned) + colonoscopy (normal) 
-SIBO test (normal) - glucose was used as I was told they only use lactulose if the patient is diabetic. I suspect this could be a false negative, but the glucose majorly messed up my digestion, it permanently made my bloating and slow motility worse 
-Allergy blood test (mild allergy to wheat but not celiac, shrimp allergy, soy allergy) 
-Multiple blood labs (somehow all normal even with my low food intake) 
-Gastric Emptying Study (normal - scrambled eggs and toast, ate them all) not sure if I should get retested as it seems stupid that they have you fast, my slow motility issues seem to show up after a couple of meals and in the early afternoon

Symptoms:
-Constipation:  by far my worst symptom. I‚Äôve had occasional issues with constipation throughout my life, and even if I go a little bit each day, or even a lot on a good day, the motility slowdown still happens in the afternoons and I can never eat more than 1000 calories in a day. 
-Slow motility: sometimes mornings are okay, but by the early/mid afternoon, I‚Äôm extremely bloated and food seems to just sit in my stomach. 
-Early satiety: One day in June 2024 I ate my usual breakfast and suddenly had hot fire burning sensation in my stomach. Stopped all coffee and acidic foods as they burned too, ate no more than 500 calories in just sourdough bread for a month because it‚Äôs all I could stomach. Now I can tolerate a little bit more variety and even got up to 1200 calories a day a couple months ago, but after all these tests with the Breeza, colonoscopy prep, and glucose, my motility has slowed down much more and now I get severe bloating in the afternoons. By morning my stomach is mostly flat, although it depends on how inflamed it feels.
-Globus Sensation/Reflux: sometimes if I eat too much or too frequently I have sever globus sensation, feels like food and/or air is coming up and I have to walk for hours in order to help it resolve. 
-Torso tightness/pain/cramping: at random times I get tightening sensation of entire torso, like all of my bowels/intestines are seizing up. And I can‚Äôt eat, drink, or even sit comfortably until they relax again. Sometimes I wake up with it, other times it comes and goes for a couple hours in the day. 
-Indigestion: No food is safe, sometimes a food is safe one day with no symptoms, the next time I eat it I get severe nausea and a feeling like something is fermenting inside me. I just have to wait for it to resolve. 
-Weight Loss: Due to 1000 calories being my max intake for 5 months, I‚Äôve lost almost 30 pounds and feel extremely weak, fatigued, muscle aches etc 
-All of these symptoms get 10x worse on my period. I‚Äôve never tolerated hormonal birth control well (sensitive to most drugs), so I have had the Paraguard (copper) IUD for about 4 years 


Treatments tried:
-Nexium 14 days right after symptom onset: this caused severe constipation that I feel snowballed into this motility issue
-Tums: work sometimes depending on the type of reflux I have
-Pepcid: produced an awful, horrible rotten/garbage taste deep in my throat that made me gag
-Magnesium oxide 400-600mg a day: used to work well before all the tests, now hit or miss and just makes me bloated 
-Lexapro: even at 2.5mg for two weeks I got debilitating migraines
-Prucalopride (Motegrity): paid $570 out of pocket, and after a week of only 1/16 of the 2mg pill a day I had suicidal ideation and doom feeling, no energy, dissociation. It helped a tiny bit with motility

Any suggestions or thoughts are greatly appreciated. I didn‚Äôt know what sub to put this in as I feel I still don‚Äôt have an official diagnosis, and I don‚Äôt know where to go next in terms of medical help. ",1,1729975117.0,ibs,0,0.99,False

Jax: (softly) Mom, you‚Äôve done things I can‚Äôt ever understand. But I‚Äôm done with revenge. I‚Äôm done with this endless cycle. If we keep going like this, none of us makes it out alive. And I want something better for my boys. (pauses) Maybe we can try a different path.

Gemma: (with tears in her eyes) I want that too.

[Scene 3: Teller-Morrow Garage - SAMCRO Club Meeting]

Later, all members are gathered in the clubhouse. Jax stands in front, with Gemma by his side.

Jax: (addressing the club) I‚Äôve called you all here to make one thing clear. SAMCRO is changing. We‚Äôve been through enough death, enough loss. It‚Äôs time we make a change‚Ä¶ even if it means stepping away from the lives we‚Äôve always known.

Tig: (chuckles, trying to lighten the mood) So what, we‚Äôre goin' corporate now? Going into the bike parts business?

Jax: (smirking) Maybe not that far. But maybe we do some things that keep us in Charming, keep us legit. We can still be SAMCRO‚Äîjust‚Ä¶ SAMCRO with a little less blood on its hands.

Happy: (smiling) Does that mean fewer tattoos, or‚Ä¶?

Everyone laughs, and the mood lightens.

Jax: (serious again) I‚Äôm serious, though. We need a fresh start. I‚Äôve made arrangements for us to slowly phase out of all gun-running and other business. We‚Äôll take care of our debt, set up legitimate work, and maybe, for once, we get to be free.

Chibs: (nodding) Aye. (pauses) For the first time in a long time‚Ä¶ it sounds good, Jax. Count me in.

[Scene 4: Clubhouse Celebration]

The scene cuts to the club members gathering for one last family dinner in the clubhouse. Music plays, drinks are poured, and laughter fills the room. Even Unser shows up, begrudgingly sharing in the joy. He sits next to Gemma, who pours him a beer with a smile.

Unser: Didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd live to see this day.

Gemma: (grinning) Neither did I. But maybe we finally get a happy ending, Wayne.

Unser: If SAMCRO‚Äôs finally going legit, I might just have to retire.

[Scene 5: Jax‚Äôs Farewell to the Road]

In the early morning hours, Jax goes for one final ride on his bike, tearing down the open road with a look of peace. The camera follows him as he takes in the sights, the wind whipping through his hair. Finally, he stops on a hill overlooking Charming and sits down to watch the sunrise, a slight smile on his face.

Jax: (to himself) This is how it was always supposed to be.

He sits there quietly as the sun rises over Charming, finally finding a moment of true peace.",4,1729974827.0,Sonsofanarchy,2,0.75,False

1gcu5ti,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allotment/comments/1gcu5ti/boards_branches_and_wood_chips/,"Boards, Branches, and Wood Chips","""Your branches are hanging over the ditch; you need to take care of that..."" There I was, sitting on a bench, eating a raisin bun. Innocent enough, you'd think. But no, guilty once again of breaking garden rules! Not that it was in the 21-page rulebook, but of course, unwritten rules count just as much. Branches hanging over the ditch? Absolutely not! Imagine if you had to lean all the way off the edge of the deck to spot it: branches allegedly ruining the view. And heaven forbid that Rijkswaterstaat should navigate a three-meter-high boat down this ditch, only to get caught up in those few overhanging branches. That boat will never come, but still, just imagine.

Perhaps there's something deeper going on. Maybe there‚Äôs an unspoken issue with my garden.

Other years around this time... was I ever worried about a garden inspection? Was that even a thing before COVID? There was a year my garden was flooded, another year when it was torn open with trenches and waterfalls from all the rain. Was there an inspection then? No idea.

In a community, you get annoyed sometimes, mostly about the rules. Ironic, since my work life is one big rule matrix. But here? Rules that constantly change, don‚Äôt apply to everyone, or just cost money. I can‚Äôt stand them.

For people with less to spend, the demands stack up fast. Take a polytunnel. Sure, you can have one, but it has to be taken down every October and reinstalled in March. For those who can‚Äôt afford a glass greenhouse, a polytunnel is the next best thing‚Äîuntil you have to rebuild it every year, it wears out faster, and parts disappear. Why this brilliant rule? ‚ÄúPolytunnels look messy.‚Äù So, it‚Äôs logical: if you can‚Äôt afford a glass greenhouse in one go, you‚Äôll end up spending more on replacing polytunnels over the years. And it only makes sense that it costs more time too. It takes a lot of time and money to be poor.

Empathy, perspective, thinking beyond your own bubble? Apparently, it‚Äôs difficult. But you get used to this lack of understanding. Just like you get used to the gossip and half-truths. Was my limit the council‚Äôs willingness to hand out people's addresses, or even that they‚Äôd visit people‚Äôs homes to verify things? No, my line was crossed with a newsletter full of misinformation. Why? I don‚Äôt quite know either. And that‚Äôs how I ended up in the hassle over‚Ä¶ wood chips.

From November on, we gather pruned branches, and in February, they‚Äôre chipped. Those chips are for everyone‚Äîif you wait until the job is done, that is, an unwritten rule. Last year, people worked hard to ensure a large pile for everyone. Yet some people, without lifting a finger, were already hauling wheelbarrows full to their own gardens while volunteers were still chipping away. Rude. The complaint was fair, I nodded along. Until the story came out that supposedly, no wood chips were left for the chippers. This was told to me in the evening as darkness crept in, the chippers had gone home‚Äîand we were standing next to a large pile of wood chips that clearly wasn‚Äôt finished. But still, that‚Äôs the story they stuck with.

This year, things would be different: only those who chipped could take wood chips. Who exactly could chip? The controllers would decide that. Thankfully, that didn‚Äôt go through; otherwise, the whole chip-allotting circus would be left to a handful of people to decide. Best to avoid that.

So, this year in the newsletter: ‚ÄúWant wood chips? Then only if you‚Äôre a chipper.‚Äù Fantastic idea‚Äîif it hadn‚Äôt been planned for a weekday. Too bad for the workers, and for those who‚Äôd taken time off only to have the date changed at the last minute. And if you‚Äôve already done other volunteer work or have mobility issues? Tough luck, no chips for you. Only if you specifically chipped, that‚Äôs when you get that ‚Äòreward‚Äô because a year of making coffee doesn‚Äôt count, but two hours of chipping apparently does.

Oh, and we sent that call out only in our language, with no images, of course. Why consider the diverse backgrounds of our association? The digitally illiterate, those who can‚Äôt read this language but can speak it‚Äîthey‚Äôre just out of luck. Diversity and inclusion are officially important, but this? No need to consider it.

Could I keep my mouth shut? Of course not, so I shared my view. And I got back, ""But last year, the chippers really didn‚Äôt have any chips, and that‚Äôs just so sad.‚Äù Sad indeed, though the story didn‚Äôt hold up at all. But hey, otherwise, it would have been tragic.

In April, I took time off to reorganize the garden. I set up flower beds and dismantled four wooden boxes, placing the boards against the shed to dry. Rain, rain, and more rain. Third week of April: inspection. Eleven days later, an email. There were ‚Äúunused building materials‚Äù spotted on my garden that had to be removed ‚Äúimmediately.‚Äù Unused building materials? They‚Äôre in stock at the hardware store, I thought. But no, it was about the heavily used planks. Anything about planks or ‚Äúunused building materials‚Äù in the 21-page rulebook, the statutes, the green guide, or the lease? Nothing. AI couldn‚Äôt find anything either. The only thing I found was about permanent storage, but those planks hadn‚Äôt even been there for three weeks.

And now another fall inspection. Everything neatly trimmed and maintained because an errant twig? That won‚Äôt do. Grass longer than three millimeters? Gone. Wildflower? Snip! Twig sticking out of the hedge? Snip! Everything clipped and tidy. I thought I‚Äôd handled it all; I‚Äôve never had such a tidy garden.

Branches over the ditch? Didn‚Äôt think of that. Right, that really can‚Äôt happen. Rejected!

Meanwhile, three-quarters of the neighbor‚Äôs garden is covered in plastic, plus a terrace with garbage bags full of weeds‚Äîthat‚Äôs what the association wants to see. No critters, no greenery, just lovely black plastic already starting to tear.

Boards, branches, wood chips. That was my garden year. Did I enjoy it? Did I learn anything? Maybe that following the rules doesn‚Äôt matter because, even if you do, you‚Äôll still hear what you apparently shouldn‚Äôt have done. Or did I learn not to comment on the chipping plans of those who handle inspections? ‚Ä¶Nah.

And those volunteer tasks at the garden? Let others do them. The maintenance team, the garden shop, and the website?

I‚Äôve got more important things on my mind: branches, boards, and wood chips.

1gcu33u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gcu33u,October Trip Report w/ 11 month old baby,"After never having gone abroad as a couple, and almost ten years since our last non-UK holidays respectively, (Covid, wedding, baby etc) we spent this past week in Paris. First thing to say is we really lucked out on the weather, warmth and sun that doesn‚Äôt usually happen in October!

Accommodation: we stayed in a small flat in the 18th near Marcadet-Poissonniers. Our initial walk from Gare Du Nord up Barb√®s was a surprise as we had not read up on places to avoid, however as former South Londoners, it was fine once we realised what kind of area it was. The flat, unlike a hotel, allowed us to cater to our baby‚Äôs food easily and we were able to save some money cooking for ourselves. A cheap place to stay, safe during the day and well connected to Montmarte and the centre via bus and Metro. 

Day one: we started with baby in the carrier after weaving through Chateau Rogue with a buggy the previous day proved tricky enough. Walked to Montmarte and took in the Sacr√© C≈ìur, which was stunning. We arrived early so it was quite quiet and most of the scammers weren‚Äôt awake! We had lunch at Mamie Collette on Rue de Trois Fr√®re, an amazing little place that we found on here, we cannot recommend it enough. The beef bourguignon was delicious, great music and a quiet atmosphere. After this we went to Place du Tertre and had a family portrait done. Well worth the time and money, the artist (Marie No√´lle) was lovely, and did well to keep our baby focused for her part!

Day two: a planned trip to the Louvre, which I can only describe as a disaster. After a sore day carrying the baby we were hoping for a buggy day at what claims to be basically the only accessible attraction. I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say half the lifts were not working, which made navigating staircases a real headache. Many of the staff just suggested carrying the buggy up and down the stairs. Not a practical solution for any disabled parents, so not the place to bring a buggy. We saw Mona Lisa and tried to get to a few other exhibits before just giving up and leaving. We then went to Galeries Lafayette, had a lovely meal on the top floor with views of the Eiffel Tower. Waits for lifts were long but to be expected in a busy shop. Unlike in the UK, nobody cares if you have a buggy and won‚Äôt get out to allow you in. 

Day three: we weren‚Äôt able to book tickets for the Tower in advance but decided to chance it early morning and only had to wait a few minutes before getting tickets and into the elevator (sans buggy after the previous trouble!) We were then booked on a river cruise which allowed us to see a lot of the usual tourist visits that our short trip and tired legs didn‚Äôt allow us to get to. Vedettes was the company we went for in the end and the tour guide was great and really engaged with the older children on board. We didn‚Äôt have any plans post-cruise so decided to head to BHV Marais, much quieter than Galeries Lafayette and had a lovely book section, plus it‚Äôs the place to find house numbers if you‚Äôre keen to take a bit of Paris home. 

Day four: a free day so we head back to Montmarte, Cafe des Duex Moulins for coffee and a Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e (plus some very good avocado toast). We had a stroll and browse of the shops, personally I think it‚Äôs the best place in Paris to do this once you get a few streets from the funicular and it quietens down. Did some touristy things like buying macarons and returned to Pain Pain, which we visited on day one, for one last pastry before heading back to the apartment to pack up! 

Tips for parents: 

1. Anything bigger than a yo-yo buggy cannot go anywhere. I assumed, naively, that at least some places that suggested they‚Äôd be disabled and buggy friendly would be. They‚Äôre not, and whilst that‚Äôs frustrating in the places where it would be accessible with more effort (Louvre), in most of Paris it‚Äôs just not possible because of the age of the infrastructure. 
2. Definitely book somewhere self-catered if you have a baby. It makes things much easier and gives you a place to go back and let them crawl around and let off steam. 
3. Learn basic French. My wife knows enough to hold a conversation on the bus, whilst I struggle to order a coffee without coming across with the same comprehension as my baby. You need to know words like pousette, how to ask for help when lifts are broken, and where the hell you can change them! (Starbucks usually, although many places let us change our baby in the cafe on their bench seats). 
4. Nowhere has high chairs. From what I can gather, most French people don‚Äôt really take babies and very young children to restaurants, so they aren‚Äôt catered to. I recommend bringing a portable, folding high chair (looks like a mini camping chair, available on Amazon) so you can strap it to a normal chair - our one regret was not bringing ours! 

Lastly, I leave this trip convinced that any reputation for rudeness this city has is based entirely on people you just happen to walk by. There does appear to be a pathologic need to walk straight at people, even on an empty pavement. It led to several moments of my wife, with a baby strapped to her, being shoulder checked when the only thing she didn‚Äôt do to move out the way was jump into the traffic. Once you realise no one gives a shit then you do learn to join them or suffer, but the first few days it was annoying. However, every person we spoke to was welcoming, kind, helpful, engaged with our baby and overall made the trip even better than we‚Äôd hoped. We are really grateful to everyone we met, and this sub, for making our trip the best it could be and for helping keep our baby happy.",24,1729974360.0,ParisTravelGuide,0,1.0,False

Or more likely, 3 days. Or maybe 7 or 8 days. Or maybe not at all. Guaranteed!!","About 25% of the time I order an overnight/2-day order it's delayed by a day or two. When I get the message that my delivery is delayed, I go back and check, and the item still says 1-day delivery. What truly confounds me is when they inform me my item is delayed by 2 days, while the page for the item says ""Order in 30 minutes for same day delivery.""

Are they flat out lying? Are they incapable of managing distribution? What is the deal?

I once posted how I ordered four *overnight* items and they emailed me, on the night after it was late, that my item was delayed by 8 days. I called and they told me because one item was out of stock, my entire delivery was delayed by 8 days. The order included time-sensitive items.

That's when I canceled their primero service that I pay for to get fast free delivery. I still have a couple months paid, so I still order but not for time-sensitive items, or very valuable items, or items that are delivered by the 3rd party seller. The primero service is absolutely a joke.

It amazes me when they tell me ""You saved $10 on overnight shipping!!!!! And your item will be delayed by a couple days.""

I ordered coffee creamer for the 4th time a couple days ago. Despite the item page always saying ""overnight delivery"", they have never delivered creamer overnight. Creamer was one of the items in my 8-day delayed order.

I was informed yesterday that my overnight delivery of creamer is delayed until today. My expectation, based on past performance, is that tonight they will delay it by another day or two.

UPDATE: I just called about my delayed creamer - the reason it was delayed is because they lost the package. But now it has been found and is on it's way. If a small company pulled these antics they'd soon be out of business.",11,1729973970.0,TalesFromTheCustomer,4,0.92,False
