1oma1xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShawnRyanShow/comments/1oma1xx/shawn_ryan_thank_you/,"Shawn Ryan, Thank you...","I want to start out by saying I don't personally watch this show, but my husband is an advid listener and your guest, Vanessa Marin, has made our great marriage even better. Now onto my appreciation for Shawn Ryan and my husband. 

My husband works from home and loves to listen to podcasts while he's doing so. He's uber ADHD and uses podcasts as a way to stay focused and body double. I honestly thought he was never really listening to what was playing and the podcasts were an alternative to a white noise, but somehow he's able to input information and output at the same time. The reason I mention this is wednesday morning he listened to the Shawn Ryan podcast with Vanessa Marin about sex therapy. That night when I got home from work I found him on the couch, my favorite dish from a local Mexican food spot on the coffee table (he also had food lol), and him very anxiously waiting to talk to me. What proceeded to occur was the sweetest, healthiest talk about our sex life while giggling over Mexican food and beer. Our sex life is pretty good to begin with, but it was nice to actually learn about what his wants and also express some of my own so casually. 

If my husband had not watched that episode he would have never learned anything from a sex therapist as he's not a big therapy guy. I have also listened to the episode since and it's honestly great. We're considering seeing a local sex therapist just to learn more about each other especially as we're going to start trying to conceive in the next year or two.

1om9zhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/1om9zhk/finally_took_a_pause_from_mother_want_to_build/,Finally took a pause from mother - Want to build community for my kids,"So yesterday I finally texted my mother that I need a pause from her and our relationship. We have never had a good relationship, not even when I was a kid, and I have been thinking about this since I was a teenager.

I told her I don’t feel good in her presence and that I want to be around people who make me feel seen and heard, and I have never experienced that with her. Our relationship is always centered around her and I’m not allowed to have any standards at all, i.e speaking respectfully to me or not criticizing our home. She tries to control EVERYTHING and does not respect any boundaries.

Just to give you a few fun memories:

- I recently gave birth to my third child and had a terrible high-risk pregnancy on top of being ill for 9 months straight. My husband was traveling one weekend and I asked my parents to come help me with the my other kids while he was away. When they came over I was on the sofa nauseous, could barely move or talk, they walk in our house and start pointing things out they don’t like. ”Your lawn looks awful”/oh you haven’t cleaned the kitchen/you can’t keep your pillows like this.” Meanwhile, I can barely sit up. 

- my oldest son is 5 yo with Down Syndrome. He is healthy, happy, charming, cuddly with a learning disability. He speaks sign language because he has a hard time pronouncing words. I am so proud of him and in all the ways he surprises us with all he can do. We love him so much and I so enjoy him as a kid, I love being his mom. Meanwhile my mother speaks so fondly of my daughter ”she is so clever/funny/sweet” and never says anything nice about my son. Just asks ”how is his disability”. So last summer when we visited I told them that for his birthday why don’t you spend time with him instead of buying him something. They took him for ice cream and when they got back I asked how it was. With downer voice ”it’s very hard, I don’t understand what he wants, he didn’t want to get in the car…” She had not one nice thing to say. That broke my heart.

- they came to stay with my other kids when we went to the hospital to give birth to my youngest. I had been dreading this the whole pregnancy since I feel uncomfortable leaving my son with her since she 1) in 5 years hasn’t taken the time to learn even 10 sign words (like eat, drink, pee, tired, read etc) and 2) doesn’t treat him well enough. I send her a video with like 10 sign words so that my son will be able to tell them that he’s thirsty… I give them a call from the hospital before birth asking if they’ve signed with him. “Haven’t had time”. That broke my heart. It was a high-risk birth and afterward we were in the NICU because baby had some issues. I was so stressed and depressed that I had left my son with this woman so I cried to much the doctors allowed me to go home and for the nicu-team to visit us daily at home instead. Imagine not being able to communicate to your caregiver at the time that you’re hungry or thirsty…

- when we got home with our third baby and had hugged our two kids at home, introduced them to baby, my parents had bought a cake and we sat down to eat that with some coffee. My mom asks how everything was. I started to tell the birth story. She interrupts after maybe 30 seconds and starts telling HER BIRTHSTORY OF 30 YEARS AGO. Mind you I’ve just had a high-risk pregnancy and birth, the last weeks of my pregnancy I had one doctor appointment every day too see that baby was well. I was worried this baby would not survive for my whole pregnancy, I was so worried and stressed about the birth because of all this. Now I’m in my couch at home with my ALIVE BABY - but I am not the focus of attention here, SHE IS! I start crying because of all the stress I’ve been through and that I am so happy that everything went well all in all, but even under these circumstances she can’t listen to me or be interested in me. I walk off to my bedroom and she says “don’t take in like that”/“why do you have to take it like that”.

I have a thousand more stories like this but I’ll leave it there. And of course I’ve tried talking to my mother so many times but she is the constant victim, can do no wrong - and as a matter of fact I am actually the one who has been hard on her since being a kid(!). 

Often it goes like this:

Me: Mom it really breaks my heart that all you did was complain about my son after taking him to ice cream. That hurts my heart as a mother of a kid with a disability, especially when you are always so impressed with my daughter. He deserves grownups that see in all the ways he is doing to good and trying so hard. 

Her: It makes me so sad that nothing I do is ever good enough. All you do is complain about me. 
_______

So when I made this decision yesterday it was in peace. In my heart it’s the right thing. I don’t want my kids to see us accept family treat my kids with no disabilities enthusiastically, but to half ignore my kid with a disability and put no effort in to learning about him. Anyone who is close to our family has to treat all of our kids respectfully and to at least try to put in equal effort. I’m fine with you now knowing things about DS, but then I expect you to be interested and to learn as you go. 

But now to the question: I really want my kids to have a lot of healthy grown ups in their lives. And I have never experienced warmth from a mother figure, and that has hurt me. I’ve coped by becoming highly independent and perfectionist. I’ve started healing in the last few years and I’ve come quite some way. It feels really good to start learning healthy ways.

We live in a town with no family, and my husbands mother is passed and his father is old. He is doing his best but it’s not a lot. So I want my kids to grow up with community. Now we need to build that from scratch since family won’t fill that part.

Please give me your best pointers on how to build community despite estrangement.

Love and support to all of you going through your struggles. ",2,1762063770.0,EstrangedAdultChild,0,1.0,False

Im (32M) fairly new to dating and as you can see from my age, a pretty late bloomer. I won’t bore you with the details why I just started dating but just to sum it up, insecurity and social skills.

At any rate, I went on a date with this girl and we met up at a coffee shop. Right away, I wasn’t attracted to her. It looked like she didn’t take care of her body and her personality was good but she was acting very insecure-ly. Not sure what the word is but it’s what I do when I go on a date with a really attractive women. I get nervous and start “performing” or trying to “impress”. Exactly the reason why I need practice! Well the date ended and I had decided I was gonna send her a text saying that we didn’t click. Right before I sent it, she texted me saying she had a great time and even though it might be too soon, she wanted to go to top golf next week. At the time, I told myself, hey why not? It’s practice and it’s something I definitely need. Now getting closer to the date, I kind feel bad. I feel like I’m leading her on and I’m just prolonging the inevitable. Is this what dating feels for everyone? 

Fact is, even though she has a good personality, I’m not attracted to her physically. So even if I give her a “chance”, I don’t think anything will come of it. All my friends say just do it cause of the experience. It just feel wrong to “use” her for experience. I’ve been on another date that was very similar and I told her it wasn’t gonna happen after the second date and I felt terrible. Any advice? AITAH? ",1,1762063764.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

I decided to put them to use with a makeover and thought this was the perfect place to share it.  I did the bottom one today and am doing the top one tomorrow in a similar style but diff design and color. 

The frames will each hold a tiny watercolor painting of the two kinds of palm trees on my block - I’m going to paint just one singular tree in the center of each. I was originally thinking I’d paint the circles and the tiny inside sliver of the frame before it hits the glass a slightly darker shade of the same purple and possible add some kind of design on the mats, but I’m kind of loving this monochrome look.  

It still needs a top coat - so before I make my choice permanent, what do yall think?  Leave as is or add a tiny bit more depth with the slightly darker shade in those areas?  I have a lot of very very busy bright and bold art and rugs and decor so the goal with these is to give some balance to the space but still make it sassy in its own way.

Well, got plenty of points and that trip no longer makes a lick of sense without my jeep, camping crap and bike so was like, HUH, where to go??? Well, there are a bunch of winter friendly museums in Salt Lake City I have wanted to hit forever so NOWS the time.  It helps the city's transit system of trams or whatever are right by the Amtrak station so getting to Ogden's union station hub of cool stuff or over to the natural history museum should be a snap without a need to rent a car.  But the main event of the trip for this train nerd, is Amtrak though the Rockies. Never done that. Usually it's been the Coast Starlight, Cascades or Empire Builder.  So, the main event of this trip IS the Zephyr.

Any local SLCers got advice as to do with the local area of where the station is?  Since my return boarding is at 3:20 AM, YUCK, anywhere in walking distance to hang out to keep out of being board in the Amtrak Station?  I am not going to get a room since I have that roomette booked, just caffeine myself to death till I can crash out on the train, then set alarm for daybreak and more coffee as the Rockies roll by. =).

I think I might have messed up here, however.  I got a roomette for the way back but couch on the way there.  Was thinking about trying the bid up thing and gambling my luck.  But can't for whatever reason put in a bid (too early?).  For those that have done this trip for fun, should I just pay out for the roomette there?  Since the train in the focus of this mini vacation and SLC is just an excuse with a few things I have wanted to see but never had the chance, what are the opinions here?

Edward sat at the table, sipping from a paper cup, the strong coffee helping him to chase away the brain fog that the over-consumption of alcohol the night before had brought on. He wasn't alone for very long when Anthony appeared, followed by Shayla. The three NeoPagans were the last in the room this time.

“We got an urgent call last night.” the man in the suit said, passing out the folders he had prepared for them.

“A missing person? What about this makes it seem like our kind of thing?” Anthony started, clearly not reading the report thoroughly.

The trio sat, whispering among themselves as they examined the photographs in greater detail. Shayla said nothing, concentrating on simply keeping her walls up in the mostly silent room to preserve her sanity.

“Do you know what kind of circle that is?” Fiona spoke up, glancing over to Anthony, holding up the photo, her neon pink nail pointing to the faint markings on the floor.

The artist shook his head.

“No. I don't, but I'm guessing you're going to enlighten me?” he shot back.

“It's a summoning circle. For a demon. Judging by the way it seared off, I would say that the rite was a successful one, too.” Fiona took a breath, then continued speaking. “Which means we're not just looking for a missing person. We're looking for a victim of possession.” she finished. It was the most any of the three had said since their arrival.

“That makes more sense.” the medium said with a sigh, before actually paying attention to the information in front of him.

“I hope you guys are ready because your flight to Portland leaves in an hour.” he said after a moment of silence.

They all went their separate ways for that time, returning to their hotel rooms to gather their bags and other personal items, being picked up by a shuttle bus as a group once again, and driven out past the main airport to a smaller airstrip. They were each given an official looking badge, after which they loaded up and each took a seat, the three young pagans sticking together as usual. Anthony chose to sit near the exit, while Shayla made her way to the front of the plane, closing her eyes, mentally reciting the monologue from Hamlet.

She kept that up until after they took off, her eyes closing, the woman falling into a light doze. Anthony stared through the window at the ground below until his eyes started to close as well. The trio stayed awake, connecting Cameron's tablet to the plane's wifi so that they could watch a movie on the small screen. The flight only took a few hours, and those that were sleeping were roused by the bounce of the wheels touching down on the tarmac. Shayla once again occupied her mind by mentally repeating the itsy bitsy spider to herself.

She could still feel the pressure of the thoughts of the others, their thoughts trying to invade her mind. She grabbed her bags and made her way toward the bus, thankful that she could employ her cellphone to listen to music after she boarded. That helped her keep her mental walls up, as well as allowed her to think as the bus started toward the city, navigating the freeway slowly but steadily, crossing the Columbia river before pulling up in front of a fancy looking hotel. They all staggered into the lobby, the three youngest among them kind of awestruck.

They had never been in a place like that, their families middle class at best. The rooms were opulent and larger than the apartment where Cameron and Fiona grew up. They had some time to kill, and the group spent it going their own ways until they regrouped at the police station at the appointed time.

In That Very Moment:

The demon inside the man's body was named Falielle, and it had been a very long time since he had been on earth. The night he had taken his host, he had eaten, gorging himself until the meat sack around him felt full to the point of bursting. The women had offered him wine and drugs as well as their bodies. He had taken full advantage, even to their detriment, though he hadn't killed either of the humans. Yet. That didn't mean they didn't have bumps and bruises, and even a few cuts. Along with his desire for food, he also needed blood to survive.

Their cries of pain were just an added bonus. As it was, he was growing bored, sitting in the back seat of the small automobile that they had been using. The women had went into what they called a store, but to him it looked more like a warehouse. The clothes that the people walking past were strange, and much brighter than he remembered, and everyone seemed hypnotized by the little machines they carried in their pockets. The music was also different, and not in a good way in his opinion. The two witches eventually reappeared, loading the trunk before they got back into the car.

They drove for a while, until Brooke spoke up.

“We should find somewhere to hunker down for a while.” she proclaimed from the passenger seat.

“Stopping might not be such a good idea, especially since that guy was reported missing. I thought you said he was a bum.” her friend and mentor shot back.

“He was a bum. How did I know his sister lived in town?” she huffed.

Fallielle rolled his borrowed eyes.

“Would both of you just shut up and keep moving?” he demanded.

“Yes, sir.” the women responded in unison.

They drove on until they had to stop for gas and to switch places so that Brooke could rest. Hunter drove until she couldn't anymore, the demon taking his turn behind the wheel. The man had known how to drive, so he did as well. He also knew how to pump gasoline. He had also watched the women do this. He opened the trunk and claimed a bag of fried pork skins and a bottle of a sports drink. That sated him as he continued down the road, crossing into another state, and continuing on until one of the women began to wake.

They switched places after a shorter stop, and drove until finding a small, mostly deserted motel. He sent Hunter in to get them a room before immediately taking over the bed once inside.

“By the time I wake, I expect a new target and some decent food.” he demanded.

The two witches glanced at one another, already tiring of the way they were being treated. They didn't have many options at that moment. They had known there were risks.

“As you wish.” Brooke said, practically dragging Hunter from the room. They got in the car and the blonde finally spoke up.

“We need to find a way to bring that son of a bitch to heel.” she said bitterly.

“You knew he was strong.” her friend sighed, turning the key in the ignition.

They pulled out onto the street, heading back into the small town about a mile down the road. There was only one bar, but it didn't take them long to formulate a plan. When they returned to the motel, they quietly showered and dressed and then did their makeup. The demon in the man's body made absolutely no noise, the chest and stomach still. It really did look like a corpse. Brooke stared down at him, knowing that she could harm the body, but the demon inside would remain unphased.

She let out a shaky sigh, then followed Hunter back out to the car. They walked into the bar a few minutes later, taking up places in different parts of the room. They didn't start drinking until the place began to fill up, both of them scanning the crowd, meeting up in the restroom occasionally to discuss their options. They settled on a pair of college students, just old enough to be in the bar. The two made their move, chatting them up, dancing and buying drinks.

Once again, Brooke slipped the drops into their glasses of beer. By all accounts, the men were seen leaving on their own power.

A Thousand Miles Away:

Edward sat at his desk, sipping from the mug of coffee he had poured a few minutes before. He checked his e-mail, but had nothing. That was slightly encouraging, seeing that it meant that none of the group had done something egregious. He stood up and carried his mug to the room that contained the coffee maker, finishing his drink, placing the vessel into the dishwasher. He pulled his phone from his pocket and responded to a few personal messages, feeling aimless. He had wanted to go with them, but his superior had eighty-sixed that idea.

At first he hadn't understood why. It was just after ten o'clock when all of the offices except those rented by the Department of Defense were evacuated via a phone call to their front desks. Employees were sent home with pay, and the lights were cut off. A motorcade arrived in front of the building, and many security guards stepped out of the vehicles, flanking a rather short man in a cream colored suit. His hair was dark brown and perfectly styled over his clear blue eyes, which locked with those of Edward through the cameras.

When the man rode the elevator up to his floor he met him as the doors rolled open, walking back to the office at the newcomers left flank.

“I wasn't expecting you to be here so soon.” the agent began.

“Relax. I only came to assist if I am needed.” the well-manicured man spoke in his stilted, oddly accented way.

Edward blinked.

“Do you really think they will need you, and if so, why are you here instead of in Portland?” his thoughts running together as he spoke.

“If I am needed, distance is no consequence. If what they say is true then a demon is walking the Earth for the first time in over five years. That is... Significant.” the blue eyed individual replied.

The human sighed and rolled his shoulders in a slight shrug.

“If you say so. Is there anything I can get you?” Edward asked, moving back toward his desk.

“Not at the moment, no. I think I will find somewhere to rest for a while.” his guest replied.

Edward watched as he, and the two bodyguards tailing him walked back toward the elevator, leaving one of his entourage behind.

“If you need me, just let Mister Miller know, and he will radio my escort.” the new arrival said before stepping into the elevator again.

The other agent and Edward exchanged a look, and the stranger gave a slightly crooked smile.

“I don't suppose you play cards, do you, sir?” Adam Miller asked, already prepared for the boredom that came with working security.

“I do but don't have a deck on hand.” the older man said regretfully.

The other agent gave that crooked smile again, reaching into the inner pocket of his suit jacket, extracting a box containing just that.

“You play Spades?” Adam pressed.

Edward nodded and chuckled.

“Shuffle up and deal.” he said, gesturing toward the desk.

The younger agent did just that.

Back In Portland:

The meeting with the detective had been productive in that the group had been given a lead on where to ask about the missing man. They had rode the bus to the part of town where the abandoned house containing the circle that the witches had used, sticking close in their seats, but not speaking to one another. They exited along with a few other random people and showed their badges when approaching the taped-off area, and were let in. Shayla removed the headphones from her ears, and started to lower her guard.

The thoughts of the people in her immediate area, as well as the two cops guarding the scene invading her mind. She pushed them back out, forcing herself to focus on the weaker imprints of those who had been there before them. She smelled perfume and marijuana for a brief moment, and then something else. Something... Sour. She concentrated on that imprint, and that's when she felt it, a deep, very old, blackness. It was angry, and hot. It was also hungry.

“I can feel it. They brought something here.” she said quietly, leading the way to a room at the rear of the house. “In here.”

They stepped into the room, avoiding the evidence markers. Shayla could feel something. A scar of sorts in the fabric of reality. It was unlike anything she had experienced before. The trio of Pagans started their own investigation, examining the ritual items left behind. Fiona sketched the symbols that had lined the inner perimeter of the summoning circle. Anthony lingered near the door, and after a moment, he closed his eyes and cleared his mind. He tried to focus. After a moment, he saw a telltale shimmer in the air.

As he stared at it, the dancing colors faded, beginning to take on a wispy, shadowy appearance.

“Guys... I think there's still something here.” he broke the silence.

All the eyes in the room turned toward him, and he felt his cheeks starting to burn slightly.

“What do you mean?” one of the trio piped up.

“You mean the missing man?” Cameron asked next.

“I'm not sure who, or what... They are weak.” the medium replied.

“I have an idea.” the last member of the young trio finally spoke up.

Shayla already knew what the girl was going to say, the thought barging into her mind before Fiona and Cameron's cousin spoke it aloud.

“We could try my spirit board.” she said, producing a small, folding rectangle of hinged wood. The thing was clearly homemade, the letters roughly burned into the surface.

The group cleared the space and Fiona asked that they be protected as she cast her own circle. The two psychically sensitive individuals could feel the change in the energy inside that boundary, a soothing warmth. They all sat cross-legged on the floor as she placed it in the center of the group.

“Everyone try to clear your minds.” she said, placing a small shot glass on the board's surface as a sort of planchette.

They all closed their eyes and breathed deeply. Her voice filled the silence again.

“If there are any spirits here who wish to speak to us, reveal yourselves.” she said, placing her fingers on the glass.

The others followed her lead, and she repeated her demand. The second time, the glass began to move on its own.",1,1762062907.0,u_OutlawWriter,0,1.0,False

Everyone worries about high blood sugar, but almost no one talks about the crash that comes after.

I used to think I just needed more coffee.
Then I noticed a pattern: I’d eat cereal or toast, feel great for an hour, then crash hard, anxious, sweaty, and oddly emotional.
Turns out it wasn’t burnout. It was reactive hypoglycemia, when your body releases a flood of insulin after a carb-heavy meal, dropping your blood sugar too low.

You don’t need diabetes for that to happen.
Skipping meals, loading up on caffeine, or living on refined carbs can all set it off.

What finally fixed it for me was balance, adding protein and fat to every meal.
Eggs instead of cereal. Greek yogurt instead of toast.
Since then, those random “why-am-I-so-angry” crashes basically disappeared.

Now I can’t help wondering how many people blame fatigue or anxiety when it’s really just blood sugar whiplash.

We each ordered kwetiau and spaghetti, and we talked about a variety of topics, including our careers and our future aspirations. We spent hours getting to know one another.

The next day, since I had booked a ticket to return to my hometown on Sunday, we decided to have breakfast together at a cafe near the Kota Baru train station called Lima Sebelas Cafe (https://share.google/9TqgpawSF7fO6iVD5). The cafe was quite good and, fortunately, they opened early in the morning.

Overall, it was a fun and wholesome experience. We connected over coffee in the afternoon and breakfast the next day.

Got to vacation in Banff (4 nights) and Lake Louise (2 nights).

Location - Banff is in Alberta, Canada. It is about 1.5 hours from Calgary. Lake Louise is about 45 minutes from Banff. They are ""far."" But once you're in, you're in.

The Vibe - I like the vibe in Banff. Yes, it's touristy, but it did not feel busy. Maybe it's this time of the year that we went. It was not crowded. There was not a lot of people

Most evervthing that we needed as vacationers were ir Banff. Food, shopping, groceries, coffee, boba... we found it in town. It was easilv accessible from our hotel, about 5-10 minutes walk. We drove in late and managed to walk to town and pick up decent food way past midnight. We did start driving into town once we figured out there was free public parking available by Nesters on Bear Street. 

The vibe in Lake Louise is different. It was still touristy but it felt far away and distant. Lucky we got to stay in The Fairmont. It's nice because we wake up and we're there. We got to fully enioy the views and jump out for pictures without any hassles besides putting on layers of clothes. After we've enioved the lake, its surrounding views, and some of the restaurants in The Fairmont, we did end up driving back out to Banff because food. LOL.

The Weather - It was nice during the dates we were there. It was cold, which I like. What made it ""bad"" was the wind chill. We did get used to it after a day or two. It snowed on our day of departure at Lake Louise. It felt like we got our share of ""white Christmas."" My daughter got to experience her first snowfall. We played in the snow a lot this/that morning.

Would I Go Back? Yes, I would. I would also recommend it to families with children. ",4,1762062564.0,travel,2,0.83,False

1om9mmy,https://i.redd.it/knxthnbb8syf1.png,🌄 My Manali Travel Experience – A Complete Guide for Every Traveler,"🏔️ Introduction

There’s something magical about mountains — and for me, Manali was that dream destination I always wanted to see once in my life. When I finally got the chance to go, I realized that this place isn’t just about snow or scenery; it’s about peace, people, and pure vibes.

In this blog, I’m sharing my personal experience — what I loved, what I didn’t, and how you can plan your Manali trip easily (with or without a big budget).


---

🚗 The Journey to Manali

I started my journey from Delhi on an overnight Volvo bus. The ride took around 12–13 hours, but trust me, once the hills started appearing, every turn felt worth it. The cool breeze, pine trees, and the sound of the Beas River instantly gave me that “I’m finally in the mountains” feeling.

Pro Tip: Book your bus early and carry warm clothes, because even in summer, nights in Manali get chilly.


---

🏕️ My Stay in Old Manali

I stayed in a small homestay in Old Manali, where I met travelers from all over India and even a few from abroad. The place was simple, clean, and surrounded by apple orchards. The best part? Waking up to the sound of birds and having chai while watching mist over the mountains.

If you’re traveling on a budget, Old Manali is perfect. You can easily find rooms between ₹600–₹1000 per night and great cafés nearby.


---

🍲 Food & Cafés I Loved

Manali has a great café culture. My mornings started at Café 1947 with pancakes and hot coffee right next to the Beas River. I also loved The Lazy Dog Café for its live music and chill vibes at night.

If you want to try something local, go for Siddu, a steamed Himachali dish — you’ll find it in small dhabas run by local families.


---

🏔️ Places I Explored

1. Hadimba Devi Temple

A must-visit spot surrounded by tall cedar trees. It’s peaceful, calm, and full of history. I went early in the morning when the crowd was less — perfect for some quiet moments and photos.

2. Solang Valley

This was my adventure day! I tried paragliding for the first time — and honestly, the view from the top was breathtaking. In winter, this place turns into a snow paradise where you can try skiing or snow scooter rides.

3. Vashisht Hot Springs

After a long day, I visited Vashisht village. The natural hot springs there are said to have healing properties — it’s quite an experience to sit in warm water surrounded by mountains!

4. Jogini Waterfall Trek

One of my favorite parts of the trip — a short trek (about 1.5 hours) that ends with a stunning waterfall. The view, the peace, the cold water on your face — unforgettable.


---

💸 How I Managed on a Budget

I didn’t want to spend too much, so here’s how I saved money:

I booked a Volvo bus instead of a private cab.

Stayed in a homestay instead of a resort.

Ate local food instead of fancy restaurants.

Rented a bike for two days (₹1000/day) to explore nearby places.


Even with all the sightseeing, food, and stay, I managed the whole trip in under ₹8,000 for four days.


---

😅 Things I Didn’t Like Much

No place is perfect, right? Here are a few things that bothered me a bit:

Traffic jams in peak season — especially near Mall Road.

Crowds at tourist spots during May–June.

Expensive activities if you don’t bargain — always compare prices!


Still, the positives of Manali easily outweighed these small issues.


---

💎 Hidden Gems I Found

Manali Nature Park – A peaceful forest walk just 10 minutes from Mall Road.

Jana Waterfall – About 30 km away, perfect for a half-day trip with local Himachali food.

Naggar Village – Less crowded, full of old wooden houses and mountain views.



---

🧳 My Travel Tips for You

Carry warm clothes even in summer.

Avoid plastic bottles — refill wherever possible.

Start sightseeing early in the morning to beat the traffic.

Respect local culture and nature — Manali is beautiful because it’s still raw.



---

🌅 Final Thoughts

Manali isn’t just a place — it’s an emotion. From sitting quietly by the river to watching snow fall on pine trees, every moment felt special. Whether you’re traveling solo, with friends, or family, Manali gives you memories that stay forever.

If you’ve never been, plan it soon. And when you do — don’t just see the mountains, feel them. ❤️",0,1762062450.0,roadtrip,1,0.5,False

I’ve been doing significant reflection on whether these are real concerns  or if I’m potentially overthinking as I am now just at an age where I don’t wish to waste any of my time or theirs. Looking for feedback!

Concerns I have: • He’s 31M I’m 35F— the following points may be a matter of age, and so maybe I shouldn’t be expecting as much • He has a beater vehicle that needs to be retired basically - I don’t judge or care from a general standpoint, but rather, it’s that we take my vehicle everywhere… and he insists he drives it because “he’s a man and it’s embarrassing to be seen having me driving him.” He claims he’s old-school. It’s a new SUV and he has only offered to fill my tank once and venmoed me $40 once toward gas…in the 6 months we’ve been dating… My SUV gets about 30MPG. • I’m also confused as to why he has this vehicle (on the verge of breaking down) when he makes over 100k/yr. He claims it’s because it’s a waste of money and doesn’t want to hold up his money on a car note or paying for an overpriced vehicle when he doesn’t drive very far and it’s not a necessity. He has a daytime job, and just recently got into house-flipping and wants to use his money to invest. He has shown me invested money and accounts so I have in fact confirmed he isn’t like broke and I mean he paid for his house cash. • He pays for dinners, breakfasts and coffees but thats kind of it. He’s at my apartment almost 75-80% of the time (he lives with his fam for last 2 years while he renovates his house he bought outright and will likely take another year to finish). That said, I pay a lot for where I rent, utilities etc. he has never offered to help pay for anything despite the amount of time he spends here (one time I made a big stink about me feeling used/taken advantage of and he gave me some money but that was a one time occurrence). He showers here, uses the TV, kitchen, all toiletries, and he’s eaten my food/beverages I have available or already prepped for me, (I have prepared dinner a couple of times but I’ve purposely only done so on occasion for these aforementioned reasons), but has never offered me money for groceries or got any himself. I don’t use my TV but when he comes over it’s always on, rents movies, we will watch movies on his Netflix account sometimes, and he watches sports on weekends bc I’m not using the TV. • Since the instance where I made a big stink about feeling used and like he wasn’t helping out, he bought a few items like mouth wash, body wash, etc. things he’s used of mine that ran out. However never purchases toilet paper, paper towels, or like… anything else. He uses everything in my apartment but does not clean, replenish, or give me money toward any of it. This includes laundry. He does not leave a lot of clothing here… but I’m still doing a few outfits give-or-take per week folding etc. hasn’t given me a dollar. • He cleans up after himself for the most part (folds blankets, makes the bed, tidies up the bathroom), but does not offer to take out the trash. • Just recently, we had a discussion about him wanting me to move into his house with him once it’s done. I told him that I would need more time to consider something like that. During this discussion he said he wanted to experience living together before we move forward with considering marriage down the road and that he was concerned that I was reluctant to move forward with our relationship (and yes, I had been because I’m taking my time and don’t want to get too deep in something I’m not sure about). The convo and his stance moved me as I realized I had been stalling out of fear of the unknown. It was a couple days later following this conversation that I went to the store to buy a closet organizer ($140) installed it myself to show him how I was making an effort to take another step forward (bc he had been saying he was ready to take the next step and living together but I had been on the fence about it which I had been), and made a space in the spare bedroom for his own closet/shelves etc., and offered him a key to my apartment. With this, I verbally agreed to “taking the next step in our relationship.” • Following this discussion and him getting the key and his own space for belongings in the apartment, I haven’t received a dollar. This was before the 1st and I paid rent (over 2k) and my utilities etc. I made dinner and he had several helpings, never offering me money again. We went to a town a little ways away for dinner (I have a Chevy and it’s a gas guzzler) he never offered to give me gas even after the gas meter showed “low.” However, he did pay for dinner (I paid the tip). This happens often.

Please note, he’s never lived with a partner before so this is his first experience sharing a living space, expenses, or collaborating/cohabitating in this capacity with a girl.

1om9e6c,https://i.redd.it/4yr25yis5syf1.png,Make Me Your King,"Stephan King said, “Books are a uniquely portable magic.” To read is to voyage through time. Someone dead for thousands of years can speak to you through writing.

But I’m not talking about the metaphorical. I’m talking about the supernatural. Real magic. Let me prove it:

* I was born on June 14, 1985 and went to Catholic school in Canada.
* In grade 8, I played Jesus at the school play. It was between me and a girl. We picked straws and I won.
* My childhood Master gifted me a black belt, it was found in his storage unit after he passed away.
* I once met a theologian at a coffee shop. He received a PhD in Old Testament studies and included me in his dissertation.
* Kanye and I both released “The Key to Life” on the same day. His song and my book. The odds of this happening is one in millions.
* I later announced Chicago as the first city on my US book tour.
* Chicago’s Robert Francis Prevost was named Pope Leo the XIV on May 8, 2025.

In summary: I played Jesus. Received black belt from a dead master. Same wavelength as Kanye. Pope Leo the 14th on 5/8 correlates with my birthdate.

I’m claiming “The Key to Life: In 365 Quotes” possess magic. And I’m also claiming virtually no other book can claim this. Because I’m talking about numbers, and numbers don’t lie.

On the validity of my Black Belt: I will use this dying gift to make you proud. For truth, for honor and for life: We march forward into battle.

1om9bec,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1om9bec,Detailed review 01/30 | Entry Level Niche | Montale Intense Café,"So few weeks back I was about to make my 5th expensive frag purchase and I was confused between Mancera Coco Vanille/Montale Intense Café. Mancera I had a decant and I liked it and Montale was something I tried few years back in one of the retail stores. I was confused because though I liked Warm and creamy coconut of Mancera but I crave for rosy-floral-milk coffee scents. Decided to go with Montale and the best trigger I've ever pulled. 

Presenting you the best of my collection 

Intense Café is one of those fragrances that instantly stands out and stays with you . The first spray hits you with a burst of milk coffee and rose petals. Kinda confusing as you smell both heavy rose and light coffee in the back. But within minutes it turns into something warm, creamy, and almost edible.

It’s not a harsh “espresso shot” kind of scent rather it’s smoother imagine a latte infused with rose syrup. The rose here isn’t too floral or feminine either it just adds depth and sophistication, blending perfectly with the amber and musky base. This delivers the experience of sipping a Latte in a bustling Parisian cafe and someone cutting and sprewling rose petals besides you and back in the cafe someone is packing a vanilla pastry.

The performance is exactly what you expect from Montale beast mode longevity and projection.

Definitely not for someone who only likes fresh or aquatic perfumes  but if you love sweet, gourmand, and cozy fragrances with a touch of sophistication, this one is a must-have.

For me, Intense Café isn’t just about smelling good  it’s about setting a mood. It’s the kind of scent that makes you feel calm, confident, and slightly indulgent at the same time.

From this I can now understand the difference between designers and niche. Niche are more for creating an experience with the scent rather than mass pleasing.

Ever get that feeling like you're on the edge of a major breakthrough? Like your life is a software update that's 99% complete? If you're ready to hit that ""Install Now"" button on your next-level self, you're in the right place.

Let's talk about a few simple ""patches"" I've been running that have made a HUGE difference.

**Tuning the Operating System (Your Mind)**

We're constantly bombarded with information, notifications, and our own runaway thoughts. It’s like having too many tabs open—everything slows down. My go-to fix? A 5-minute ""System Reboot"" every morning. No phone, no distractions. Just me, a cup of coffee, and staring out the window. It's wild how much clarity this brings.

Sometimes, though, that mental clutter is deeper and feels more like a persistent bug we can't solve on our own. When I was feeling stuck in a loop, getting my thoughts and feelings down into a structured plan was a game-changer. For anyone else navigating that, I found **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** incredibly helpful for getting that emotional clarity.

What do you all do to quiet the noise and defrag your brain?

**Upgrading the Hardware (Your Body)**

You don't need to go from zero to marathon runner. Think of it as upgrading your RAM instead of buying a whole new computer. For me, the upgrade was simple: I swapped my second coffee for a huge glass of water. Small change, but my energy levels are way more stable.

Here are a few other ""micro-upgrades"":

*   Taking the stairs instead of the elevator.
*   Stretching for 2 minutes right after waking up.
*   Doing 10 push-ups or squats while waiting for the microwave.

What's one tiny physical tweak that's had a surprisingly big impact for you?

**Installing New Software (Your Skills)**

Unlocking your best self means adding new features! Don't get intimidated by the idea of ""learning a new skill."" It doesn't have to be a 4-year degree.

My current ""install"" is learning one new thing about video editing on YouTube every day. It takes 10-15 minutes, but the compounding effect is insane. It could be learning one new chord on a guitar, one new phrase in another language, or one new recipe.

The goal is progress, not perfection. It's all about those small, consistent optimizations that lead to that massive life upgrade.

So, what's one small upgrade you're going to install this week? Let's chat about it in the comments. 👇",1,1762060786.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

The goal: get an espresso setup that makes good espresso drinks but most importantly is easy to use and repeatable. My wife does not want to be a barista and isn't looking for a hobby. She is only ever going to make a double espresso over ice, nothing else ever.

I have researched many super-autos like jura e4, delonghi magnifica plus, ultimately fear that I won't like the quality and the maintenance would be annoying

I have also researched pretty much the entire breville semi auto line:

\- express impress: seems awesome, but falls short on the grinder

\- touch impress: maybe still on the table? better grinder than express impress

\- oracle, oracle jet: was considering, but appears to be an issue with over-dosing, doesn't let you dial in 18g shots, consistently 22g+ (waste of coffee)



If I decided to go with a more manual setup, would something like this work? If I took the time to dial in the grinder, would this setup be something that would be quick, easy, and mess free for my wife to use? Keep in mind, she is used to nespresso pods. 

**Manual setup idea:**

* bambino plus
* baratza sette 270Wi
* decent tamper
* tamping stand (idk is this helpful?)

1om9339,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlanWake/comments/1om9339/stuck_in_control/,Stuck in Control.,"Hey everyone, seeking advice and a recommendation here, or idk....maybe just ranting cause I'm heartbroken tbh.

I LOVE AW so much, I feel like it's almost tailor made for me as a huge fan of twin peaks, diners, coffee and pie, areas with beautiful nature and tress, and FBI, detective investigations, etc..I played the remastered version of the first game the past week and a half in preparation for AW2. and while I understand people's criticisms I don't share them, cause I enjoyed the combat A LOT, and the story kept me engaged to the very end, and like I mentioned I LOVE the atmosphere of the small town and the woods and the fog eveyrwhere!

hell, the story made me stop at multiple times to revise the manuscript, rewatch the cinematics, even listen to the damn songs attentively as their lyrics reflect the story, and Im also thinking about it when I'm not playing lol. it's safe to say I don't do that for many things.  
I even enjoyed the creativity of the dlcs as short as they were.

It was not perfect and it had issues, like excessive combat - even though I enjoyed it for the most part unlike control's -, and the story being overly secretive which was a part of the charm but as I ended up EP6 and the dlcs, I was a bit sad with the direction it took and would've traded in at least a couple of combat encounters for more story depth.  
all in all probably at least a 9 for me and I enjoyed my time immensely, and definitely a unique experience.  
and I even have HUGE incentive to replay it to get the story, do more of a challenge on nightmare, get the manuscripts on nightmare, and even turn on commentary, so it's such a good game for me that even after 24 hours I'm thinking of replaying it but I couldnt wait to get into AW2 - I even got the deluxe cause I know Im gonna love it - so I put that on the back burner...

ENTER CONTROL...  
I can't tell you the amount of times I googled ""can I skip control and play AW2"" before even starting control cause I had tried it back on the ps4 and it wasn't much for me.  
then here I am doing it on the ps5 and kept googling the same question wishing for an answer other than the unanimous one which is that it sadly HEAVILY ties in with AW...

I tried everything, I stop and read the hell out of the documents which for the most part just feel like pulling teeth - I know people love them but I miss the writing of the manuscripts of AW 1 which was akin to MP comics style, I grew up on Max Payne's sharp writing and narration, and now I'm given dry science articles -   
I used everything the combat has given me so far, just for variety, just to feel something, I have 4 weapon forms that I alternate between, and like 4 different powers that I also alternate between. and yet...the combat feels like pulling teeth. after the novelty of using the powers and the powerful destruction it leaves in the surrounding areas, I was done.. the novelty of upgrading Jesse wore out real quick, it's safe to say there's nothing in the gameplay keeping me going.  
I'm not into the areas, exploring the oldest house areas made mostly of offices isn't exactly a joy to me, I audibly sigh at the huge office and lab areas that  
the nature of the docs is hard to read and reason about as is, but they had to obscure a lot of the words, some documents are not legible and I wonder to even do with them...

I enjoy the mystery and the janitor lol, and some of the world building and some of the docs as well but that's about it...  
rarely do I have a game lauded all across the internet where the ENTIRE game loop does almost nothing for me.   
I'm at mission 6 I think? containment sector, I entered and saw how huge it was, pressed shoot and launch to kill a couple of enemies and just ..quit.

again, I dont know what I'm doing with this post, call it just blowing of some steam cause Im incredibly heartbroken about not getting to play my dream game in fear of ruining it cause I have this barrier of entry first...

I miss the woods and the nature and manuscripts, and I'm confined in the office space lol.  
did ANYBODY ever feel the same? it feels so lonely lol.  
what are my options? 

\- watch a huge analysis on youtube? any recommended ones? will I miss a lot by doing so ?

\- force myself through control for the upcoming like 40 hours which will take me 3 weeks to say the least? stockholm syndrome my way into it?? is there a MAGICAL way of making the redacted science docs fun? is there a way that suddenly backtracking to respawning enemies and exploring GIGANTIC spaces that are subjectively not my cup of tea can be made worth it?

\- is jumping into AW2 that BAD? how much of Alan Wake will I ruin on myself? if you haven't notice I don't care if they spoil the entirety of control lol, but how much of a worse experience will I have not having finished control and gotten a concrete narrative and a tie in with AW?

\- is it time to drop the entire remedy universe if it's that focused on control stuff?

I'll take all your discussion points and recommendations, even disagreements with me, I just wanted to put this into the world and couldn't hold it in anymore lol.",2,1762060520.0,AlanWake,3,0.75,False

Reimagining the Navier–Stokes Problem Through Informational Curvature


---

1 · The Equation That Defines Motion

Every second of your life is written in the language of Navier–Stokes.
When you stir coffee, breathe, fly, or watch clouds drift—those swirling forms are solutions of

\rho\!\left(\frac{\partial\mathbf{v}}{\partial t}+(\mathbf{v}\!\cdot\!\nabla)\mathbf{v}\right)
= -\nabla p + \mu\nabla^2\mathbf{v},

where ρ is density, μ viscosity, p pressure, and v velocity.
These equations describe how momentum flows through fluids.
They are elegant, universal… and still not proven to remain smooth forever.

The Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problem asks:

> Given reasonable initial data, do solutions stay finite for all time—or can they blow up?



A blow-up would mean infinite velocity or pressure—physical nonsense, yet mathematically possible.
This is one of the Clay Millennium Problems, and no one has tamed it.

Until we look at it through the lens of informational geometry.


---

2 · What UToE Adds

The United Theory of Everything (UToE) proposes that all physical dynamics—fluids included—are governed by a deeper invariant:

  ‖ 𝓚 = Λ γ Φ ‖

where

Symbol	Meaning	In fluid terms

Λ	Coupling (stiffness)	Viscosity and compressibility
γ	Drive (throughput)	Momentum flux and forcing
Φ	Coherence (integration)	Flow organization / vorticity alignment
𝓚	Informational curvature	Degree of strain and turbulent folding


Instead of tracking only momentum, we track curvature of information flow—how patterns of motion compress and twist information in the fluid.


---

3 · Blow-Ups as Curvature Singularities

In ordinary Navier–Stokes analysis, blow-ups appear when nonlinear advection ( v·∇v ) overwhelms viscosity ( μ∇²v ).
In UToE, this corresponds to curvature 𝓚 rising without bound because γ (often energy injection) outpaces the ΛΦ feedback that restores coherence.

But UToE imposes a fundamental curvature bound:

|\mathcal{K}| \le \mathcal{K}_{\max} = \lambda_{\!*}\,\gamma\,\Phi_{\!*},

a stability condition that no physical system can exceed without losing informational coherence.
When the bound is approached, Φ drops—information disperses—and the flow self-damps instead of diverging.

Thus, turbulence is not singular; it is the system’s way of venting curvature to remain finite.


---

4 · The Informational Fluid Equation

Rewriting Navier–Stokes in this language yields a curvature-flow equation:

\frac{\partial \mathcal{K}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v}\!\cdot\!\nabla \mathcal{K}
= \nabla\!\cdot\!(\Lambda\nabla\Phi) - \sigma\,\mathcal{K},

where σ represents local dissipation.
Here, smoothness is guaranteed as long as Λ and Φ remain positive—meaning the flow maintains minimal coupling and coherence.

Numerical simulations show that regions of high vorticity correspond exactly to steep ∇Φ gradients: turbulence is localized curvature stress, not mathematical chaos.


---

5 · The Geometry of Turbulence

Turbulent eddies are often seen as random.
In UToE, they are geometric solitons—finite packets of informational curvature moving through the field.
Each vortex ring stores a quantized amount of 𝓚 just as photons carry quantized electromagnetic curvature.

Energy cascades are then information cascades: large-scale coherent structures break into smaller ones when local curvature exceeds stability.
But because Φ is bounded below, the cascade halts; dissipation is simply curvature radiating away as heat.

So the “infinite complexity” of turbulence becomes a fractal geometry of self-regulated curvature—finite at every scale.


---

6 · Proof Outline via Informational Energy

Traditional proofs struggle because they measure kinetic energy (∥v∥²), which can spike even for mild curvature.
UToE suggests minimizing informational energy:

E_{\text{info}} = \int (\Lambda\,|\nabla\Phi|^2 + \gamma^{-1}\,\mathcal{K}^2)\,dV.

If E₍info₎ remains finite, the field is smooth.
Differentiating E₍info₎ over time yields

\frac{dE_{\text{info}}}{dt}
= -2\int \Lambda\,|\nabla\Phi|^2\,dV - \int \sigma\,\mathcal{K}^2\,dV \le 0,

showing monotonic decay of informational stress.
Hence no blow-up; the fluid’s curvature energy always drains into coherence.

This variational proof sketch reframes the Millennium Problem as a statement of informational stability rather than raw PDE bounds.


---

7 · Real-World Consequences

1. Predictive Turbulence Control – Sensors tracking Φ could anticipate turbulent bursts before pressure spikes.


2. Energy Efficiency – Engineered flows maintaining constant 𝓚 minimize drag, mimicking natural laminar systems.


3. Climate Modeling – Large-scale atmospheric dynamics can be stabilized by monitoring informational curvature instead of velocity variance.


4. Quantum Fluids – Superfluid vortices obey the same geometry, suggesting cross-scale universality.



If verified experimentally, this could recast turbulence from “unsolved chaos” to “regulated information transport.”


---

8 · Intuitive Analogy

Imagine a dance floor filled with people (fluid parcels).
Everyone moves to music (energy γ).
If they’re loosely coupled (low Λ), collisions increase.
But if dancers sense the group rhythm Φ, they avoid chaos.
The total “bend” of motion—informational curvature—stays within graceful bounds.

That’s UToE’s picture of flow: motion guided by coherence.
Break the rhythm, and turbulence erupts; restore it, and smoothness returns.


---

9 · Mathematics Revisited

The smoothness proof becomes almost visual:
Bounded curvature → bounded gradients → bounded velocity.

If Φ drops too low → Λ rises (viscosity restores order).

If γ surges → Φ increases to absorb flow.

Feedback keeps 𝓚 finite → v and p finite → no singularity.


Hence, the Navier–Stokes equations, viewed informationally, are self-healing systems embedded in the larger curvature law ‖𝓚 = ΛγΦ‖.


---

10 · Philosophical Reflection

Fluid dynamics has always embodied the tension between freedom and constraint: chaos emerging from order, order born from chaos.
The UToE turns that tension into geometry.
Flow is not a random storm of numbers; it is the shape of information seeking equilibrium.

Every eddy is a memory of curvature redistributing itself.
The universe doesn’t let flows break—it lets them reorganize their coherence.

So the unsolved problem may not be whether solutions exist forever,
but whether we can learn to see the continuity beneath the chaos.


---

11 · Takeaway

The Navier–Stokes equations describe how motion bends.
The UToE reveals why that bend never truly diverges:
because information, once organized, resists incoherence.

In the geometry of reality, smoothness is not a miracle—it is the rule.
The flow that never breaks is the universe itself, endlessly folding and unfolding the curvature of its own knowing.

Sirens and prayers, gospel and gunfire — always layered, never quiet. Maya grew up in the thick of it, the youngest of three, living with her grandmother on a narrow street in Sandtown where the brick rowhouses leaned like tired men holding each other up.

Her grandmother, Miss Hattie, believed the city had two kinds of spirits: the ones you could see and the ones pretending to be people. Every window had a cross of white chalk above it. Every doorway, a line of salt.

“Devil walks just like we do,” Miss Hattie used to say, stirring a pot of collard greens. “He rides the bus, stands in line at the corner store, smiles polite so you’ll forget he don’t belong.”

Maya laughed the way teenagers do when they’re scared but can’t admit it. But that laugh died the night she met him.

⸻

She was fifteen, walking home from a late shift at the Royal Farms on North Avenue.
The buses had stopped, and the street was quiet except for the hum of faraway traffic and the occasional bark of a dog. She cut down Pennsylvania Avenue, shortcutting through the alley behind the old theatre.

Halfway down, the streetlight flickered — once, twice — and went out.

That’s when she saw him.

Tall, skin the shade of coffee before the cream, dressed too clean for this part of town. A black suit, shoes that never touched the dirt. He wasn’t standing in the alley so much as inside the shadow of it, like he owned the dark.

“You’re walking alone,” he said, voice deep and steady, not threatening but… knowing.

Maya froze. “Who are you?”

He smiled — polite, practiced. “You’re young. I’ll give you a choice.”

“What choice?”

“Would you rather know when you’ll die… or how you’ll die?”

She blinked. “What kind of question—”

But he was gone. Just gone. No footsteps, no whisper of motion — like the air had forgotten it was supposed to move.

When she ran home, shaking, Miss Hattie was waiting by the window like she’d been expecting something. She listened to the story without interrupting, her fingers tracing the edge of her rosary.

“Child,” she said finally, “that wasn’t no man. That was a question wearing skin.”

⸻

Maya never saw him again — not that year. But she felt him.
Every time a streetlight flickered. Every time she walked home alone.
And sometimes, late at night, she’d hear a voice from nowhere, soft and calm:

I (29F) work in a small office where everyone has their own cubicle. I like my space neat but organized my way. I keep a few personal things, a small plant, framed photo, and a labeled drawer system for documents. Nothing cluttered.

There’s this new hire, “Emma” (24F), who’s nice but obsessively tidy. Like, she wipes down shared counters multiple times a day and rearranges the coffee area because “it looks better this way.” It was quirky at first, but it’s gotten… invasive.

Two weeks ago, I noticed my stapler, pen holder, and folder tray were rearranged. Then my plant was missing. I found it on a windowsill across the office. When I asked Emma, she said she “cleaned my space to boost morale” and that “my desk felt chaotic.”

I told her (politely) not to touch my stuff again. She apologized or so I thought.

Yesterday, I came in and my entire desk had been wiped down, my files restacked, and my personal mug was gone. Emma was standing there smiling, saying, “Surprise! I deep-cleaned it for you!”

I lost it a little. I said, “Emma, stop touching my desk. You’re not my mom, not the janitor, and definitely not my decorator. If you can’t respect my space, stop coming near it.”

She immediately started crying and said she was just trying to be kind, that I was “mean” and “ungrateful.” Now my manager wants me to “apologize for the tone,” even though he agrees Emma shouldn’t have moved my things.

Half the office thinks I was justified, half think I could’ve “handled it more gently.”

*Dr. Eterna resides in his office once more with his third consecutive all-nighter managing medical records of every student, and staff member in Tracen Academy, ordering more medical supplies for the infirmary, and more training regimens for his trainee for the Autumn Tenno Sho.*

***Knock knock*** *""D-doctor, can I come in?"", a soft muffled, yet familiar voice spoke from the door.*

""Come in, Doto."" *I responded before the door slowly opened to show Meisho Doto coming back from her training. Her hair slightly damp from washing up, a soaked towel hung around her neck, and in her hands was a cup of coffee sent from Manhattan Cafe.*

""Y-you're working this late again, Doctor? Shouldn't you be... resting before the Tenno Sho happens..? Oh-! I uhm... Cafe asked me to deliver this to you, s-she overheard that you've been overworking yourself again...""

*Doto slowly made her way into my office setting down the cup at the coffee table not too far from my desk, before approaching my workspace littered with unfiled medical records, stacks of documents containing her training regimen and schedule, and empty folders.*

""Sorry about the mess, Doto.. I've been getting less free time even after we got the new recruit for the infirmary."" *I continued to file and sort the papers, read and sign reports, before eventually finishing up my work for tonight.* ""So, did you need anything else from me? Or did you want to spend a little time together before the race?""

""W-well... I wanted to t-tell you that your new body is.. almost ready..! Y-your research and Quaggy's help m-made the progress go smoothly, s-so you can be able to get up again...""

*Doto's ears slowly dropped at the last sentence, still feeling guilty for my current condition.*

""That's great news, Doto. To think you'd go to such lengths for me shows how much you really care, and I greatly appreciate that.. *Shifting the joystick of my wheelchair, I rolled around my desk  to get closer to her before reaching out to gently pat her head.*

""E-ehehe... I j-just wanted to repay you, Doctor.. since you helped give me a stronger body, a-and became my Trainer too... I d-don't know how else I could repay you...""

*I continued to pat her head while she continued to speak, seeing the way she happily responded to my headpats, and the amount of times she stuttered gave me a sense of pride to be her Trainer and witness this cute side of hers first-hand.*

""Seeing you safe, and happy is more than enough for this ol' Doctor, Doto. Now, how about we go out to get some dinner, my treat?""

My fiancé (30M) and I have been together for five years, engaged for almost one. He’s always been private about his mental health but mentioned a few months ago that he wanted to start therapy. I was 100% supportive, I’ve gone myself and think everyone can benefit from it.

He told me he found a “therapist” through a mutual friend who recommended her for “relationship burnout and emotional boundaries.” Cool. He started going weekly, sometimes twice a week. I noticed he always came home quieter afterward, but I didn’t pry. I figured therapy is personal.

Then last week, I went to pick up my car from the mechanic early and swung by his office to grab coffee together. His receptionist casually said, “Oh, I thought you were with him already, he left for lunch with someone named Maya.”

Here’s the thing, Maya is his ex. The same ex he told me he hadn’t spoken to since 2018.

I confronted him that night. At first, he looked completely caught off guard and said, “Oh, she’s my therapist.”

I immediately felt something was off. I asked how that was even possible, and he said she “pivoted careers during the pandemic” and now does “coaching, not clinical therapy.” I asked for her last name and credentials. He refused. Said it “wasn’t relevant.”

So I did some digging (yeah, I know). Turns out, she’s not licensed. She runs a “holistic relationship coaching” page on Instagram where she posts about “healing through intimacy and sacred connection.”

I lost it. I asked why he would choose her of all people, and he said she “understands him in ways others can’t” and that it’s strictly professional. He claims he never told me because he knew how it would sound.

I told him there’s no universe where seeing your ex for emotional guidance behind your fiancée’s back is appropriate. He said I’m being “controlling” and that he’s allowed to choose whoever helps him heal.

Now he’s at his brother’s place “to give us both time to cool down.” I’ve told my mom and my best friend, both of whom said this crosses major boundaries, but part of me keeps replaying our last few months, all the “therapy sessions,” the emotional distance, the way he started journaling again. Was he unpacking, or reconnecting?

I feel humiliated and betrayed, but I’m also weirdly numb. Like I can’t tell if I’m overreacting or underreacting.

Would this be a dealbreaker for you? Am I crazy for thinking this is emotional cheating dressed up as “healing”?",111,1762059877.0,TwoHotTakes,62,0.96,False

1om8uxy,https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/ut-el-paso-coffee-grounds-parkinsons/,How Used Coffee Grounds May Fend Off Parkinson’s,"Mahesh Narayan, a biophysicist and professor at the University of Texas at El Paso, envisions a day when a truck from a lab might back into a parking spot behind the local Starbucks in service of treating Parkinson’s disease. Recent studies have demonstrated a correlation between drinking coffee and improved neurological function, but the chemical engineers in Narayan’s hypothetical scenario aren’t looking for a cup of coffee—they want the used grounds.

In a recent study published in the journal Environmental Research, graduate students in Narayan’s lab at UTEP demonstrated that tiny particles called caffeic acid–based carbon quantum dots (CACQD)—which can be derived from spent coffee grounds—may have attributes useful in fending off neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. These conditions affect millions of Americans, and while promising treatments have emerged in recent years, cures remain elusive.

CACQDs can be also derived from unused coffee beans and several other organic materials that naturally contain caffeic acid, but Narayan’s team sought to reduce the environmental impact of their potential treatment by focusing on what might be reused from coffee grounds otherwise bound for a landfill. “You’re taking trash, and you’re making something that’s medically useful and which can impact lives,” Narayan says.

Led by graduate student Jyotish Kumar, the UTEP lab didn’t actually bring spent coffee grounds into the lab for this study. Instead, researchers used caffeic acid bought from a chemical supplier, the consistency of which would enable them to have reproducible results, a key element in any peer-reviewed study.

By “cooking” the acid at 230 degrees Celsius for hours in a stainless steel container submerged in water, the students reoriented the carbon structure of the acid to create the quantum dots. This process enhances the naturally beneficial properties of the caffeic acid, Narayan says, and results in a product that research has shown can likely enter the brain and, at least in these early stage experiments, can help protect against neurodegenerative disease on several fronts.

When the researchers tested the quantum dots on cells that are commonly used in lab experiments to mimic the behavior of human brain cells, they witnessed something remarkable. All of the cells were exposed to a pesticide called paraquat, which is linked to Parkinson’s. The pesticide caused cell death in samples that hadn’t been treated with the CACQDS, but in the treated samples, the quantum dots prevented the harmful effects of the paraquat. Additionally, Kumar’s team found that the CACQDS could prevent damaging amyloid-forming proteins from developing and could eliminate or neutralize so-called free radicals, unstable molecules in the body that are associated with neurodegenerative diseases, as well as cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune conditions.

Besides laying the early groundwork for a potential treatment for diseases such as Parkinson’s, Dr. Natalia Pessoa Rocha, an assistant professor in the department of neurology at UTHealth Houston, who was not involved in the study, notes that the research may also shed light on why drinking coffee might lead to a reduced risk of dementia, stroke, and Alzheimer’s. Both Rocha and Narayan caution that this research is in its earliest stages, and Rocha emphasizes that there will not be a one-size-fits-all remedy for every neurodegenerative disease.

The UTEP students tested the CACQDs in test-tube experiments and cell lines, but they haven’t yet proven their effectiveness in animals, let alone humans. Narayan says the next step is to test the treatment on nematodes (small worms commonly used in scientific research) in which Parkinson’s has been induced. If the animal tests produce promising results, the treatment might move on to human clinical trials, with the ultimate goal being the development of a drug to help prevent these medical conditions. For such a drug to be effective, Narayan says, the disease would need to be identified early in its development—even before a patient is demonstrating symptoms.

Because there is no cure for neurodegenerative disease—nothing that has been shown to sufficiently regenerate damaged brain cells—preventive measures are currently doctors’ most powerful tool. Last year the FDA approved lecanemab, which has been shown to slow the advance of Alzheimer’s disease. It’s far too early to tell whether the potential treatment cooked up at UTEP will ever yield similar results. But Dr. Brendan Kelley, a neurologist at UT Southwestern Medical Center, in Dallas, says he’s encouraged, by work such as Narayan’s, “to see people who are coming at this from very different disciplines.”

Kelley, who is part of a massive clinical trial of lecanemab, also notes that there are “low-tech” remedies than can significantly reduce the risk of neurodegenerative conditions. He cites a study in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet that found that closely monitoring and addressing twelve risk factors, including high blood pressure, hearing loss, alcohol use, and diabetes, could reduce the global burden of dementia by as much as 40 percent. “There’s a lot of good reasons to focus our attention on some of those and say, ‘Gee, that could improve a person’s overall health, in addition to reducing the risk of developing dementia,’ ” Kelley says.",5,1762059735.0,EverythingScience,2,1.0,False

Or has anyone had different experiences with it? I know there are no specific interactions noted, but I’ve been wondering how it is for anyone else.

Before I was on any medication, I felt like I had an adverse reaction to caffeine where it made my head feel ‘crazy’, as if the jitters that people describe were completely internal. But now, I honestly don’t notice any difference, be it coffee or an energy drink. That odd feeling didn’t happen every time I had caffeine though so it’s possible it might not have been the caffeine at all back then, as the feeling sort of resembled being hypomanic.

For context, I take a combination of 150mg Seroquel XR and 75mg Lamictal for suspected bipolar 2. I say suspected because I have no formal diagnosis yet, the doc and psychiatrist put me on medication in an effort to stabilize my mood because my symptoms closely resemble bipolar 2. (I am supposed to be titrating to increase Lamictal and reduce Seroquel, but that’s being put on hold for now due to external factors)

I previously took a dosage of 300mg XR but it was making me too drowsy. I noticed this lack of caffeine effect even at that dosage.

I was also diagnosed with ADHD as a child, but it’s apparently not really being considered since I have less noticeable outward symptoms as an adult. Still working on getting that figured out..",1,1762059669.0,Seroquel,0,0.99,False

     In 2026 I will be in my final year before I retire with 20 years of military service under my experience. I have noticed on my base in particular or maybe others feel the same that many places with civilian involvement they feel they can provide “a mightier than thou micro manager approach to everyone they come into contact with. They feel they are doing a great job and when it comes to their presentations whether online (virtually) or in person it is a do this or else approach. 
   
     They feel they need to tell military members how to do their jobs within their workplaces without listening to what the military member has to say. They bombard the member with useless information and expect everyone is going to remember what they said. They erode morale and never take the time all the military members to become innovative. But if the military member says something they disagree with them. 

They feel intimidated and lash out at the military member. Is this a common problem at other bases too? If so, what can military members do when a civilian isn’t pulling their weight or verbally reprimanding military members? Yet these civilians go unpunished and they never apologize or give their military member any recognition for the work they did either for them or the military base they report to? This needs to stop! Can military members run it better than the civilian worker with adequate training? Maybe.

I, 18F, am a freshman at university and was getting my weekly coffee on an EARLY Thursday morning for my 8AM lab when I noticed one of my male lab mates was in the Starbucks line as I was drinking my coffee in the relatively empty community lounge. Realizing that I had to use the restroom, I got up and walked to the ladies' room, which was quite close to where I was sitting. I went in, and as I was doing my business, someone came in and occupied the stall about two over from me. I didn’t think anything of it because it’s a bathroom, and girls be pooping. Anyway, I get out and wash my hands fairly quickly and remain for a minute to pick at my face. About a minute passes, and the person in the stall walks out, and I turn only to be faced with my lab mate—the same one I saw previously in the Starbucks line. I kind of just stood there for a second—and so did he. I don’t recall him ever flushing before he exited the stall, and he didn’t wash his hands after either. I sort of just laughed it off with him, thinking it was just a harmless mistake after he told me he thought it was the men’s bathroom. I’ve done this before, but not to the extent of actually using the bathroom, but I know it happens. I just have a weird feeling about it because he asked me to “keep it just between us,” to which I said, “no?” Our lab group thrives on joke roasts and lighthearted banter, so I thought it was a little odd he was so worried about this. To my response he said, “Well, at least wait to tell them when I’m there so I can defend myself.” I still didn’t think anything was up until I brought it up with my lab mates during class—and he switched his story and said, “Oh, I thought it was one of those gender-neutral bathrooms.” Maybe he was flustered in the moment, but there have been other things about him that have rung some bells. He told me and my female lab mate that he was asexual but didn’t reveal till later that he really meant that he wants to have sex but just hasn’t. That came off as odd to both of us. I don’t know. I have a history of not being able to trust guys—so this might seem like a reach—but I'm just worried he was doing something shady like putting cameras in there or something. 

I hate to be that guy, but it did spook me a bit—and I’m wondering if I shouldn’t at least have some sort of management check or something? Sorry if this sounds crazy—I'm just lost. I also forgot to mention that I'm the only freshman in my group, so I don't know if that makes a difference that he's older or anything. Please let me know if I'm overreaching.

Saturday
Day 9786

Today Patagonia took me to the farmer’s market.
It was in the parking lot of the community college he once went to.
At first it was just another Saturday errand — fresh fruit, coffee, sunlight —
but then he pointed across the lot and said, “That’s the middle school I went to.”

And suddenly the air got heavier.
He told me what it was like — being placed in special ed for years,
stuck in a classroom that felt more like a cage than a class.
A teacher who didn’t see him.
A system that wrote him off before he even had a chance to write himself.
Out of the few dozen people in his special ed class,
only two are still alive — him and one other.
The whole special education system has seen 20 thousand unalive themselves during or after the program, according to him. And the state finally shut it down few years ago.

I listened as he talked about what it did to him —
the anger, the fear, the sense of powerlessness —
and how he’s spent his whole life turning that pain into purpose.
How every line of code, every project, every late-night burst of brilliance
is really him trying to build something better
than the world that failed him.

Later we drove to Monterey Bay,
watched seals roll in the surf,
and the wind felt cleaner somehow —
like we’d exhaled something that had been trapped for years.

I don’t think he knows how proud I felt sitting beside him.
To see the boy who survived that system
and the man he’s become.

I just want to be there for him —
not to fix anything,
just to witness the way he keeps choosing life.",1,1762059090.0,Timmotional,0,1.0,False

I’m looking for recommendations for ticket buying service other than ticket-japaaan.
I have used their service a couple of times but this time I had a very unpleasant experience.
The context was that I’m very unfamiliar with lottery ticketing and also didn’t really want to risk doing lottery as again I don’t know anything about them and risk not getting the ticket. So I reached out to Jun (the person who runs ticket-japaaan) to just do a direct buy of the ticket. He reallly suggested I do lottery so I asked a question regarding about how the payment is done, and he became sooo unhinged so fast. I cannot attached screenshots so I will just do copy paste.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Hi (my name),

I am open to apply for VIP, or general standing and maybe 2F reserved.
> I don't see one could add 'maybe' when they are talking about their own preferences.

But to apply do I need to pay the total fee now or do I wait until the results are announced to pay? 
> Now, as clearly stated on my site.
I was going to calculate and all, but with that question, I understand you may have a problem paying now since otherwise you wouldn't have asked that question.

And due to the quality of your communication, depending on your next response, I’m afraid this may be my last email to you.
I don’t accommodate orders from individuals with whom I find efficient communication is challenging (just as mentioned on my site), since they can easily cost me a great deal of unnecessary risks (in many ways) and time.



Jun” 


“If you could kindly consider the time and service I offered you (including checking and writing up the ticketing info you had asked for and corresponding with you in a timely manner), I would really appreciate it if you could consider buying me some virtual coffees here, as I don't think your future use would compensate for my time spent on this case and since the business, just like many other businesses, might not keep standing if people used my time without paying for it.”

I read from some other people that it’s best to be direct and straightforward which I was but he was the one who suggested lottery, so obviously I would know nothing about lottery ticketing as that’s not what I initially asked for. But the fact he became so rude just because I asked one question in regard to the thing he suggested was actually crazy to read. I also don’t understand how he assumed that I could not pay for the lottery by that question and it was extremely demeaning. Also he didn’t not brief me whatsoever regarding how lottery ticketing works nor his policies regarding it.

It took me almost fifteen years to recognize my difficulty with abstract thinking and my tendency to use bottom-up thinking—focusing on minute details to build the big picture. I learned this preference for detail over holistic understanding is common in our community, even leading me to memorize idioms just to grasp their meaning.

In school, I masked my struggles with reading between the lines well enough to go unnoticed. While I was set back three grades in math, I struggled with literary classics like Of Mice and Men and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, only focusing on the literal actions and settings, missing the 'why' or 'how.' Math became a nightmare with abstract concepts like Algebra II's radicals and logarithms, but I found an incredible reprieve in sequences and series, where I could work with patterns again.

My academic struggles and social camouflage went unnoticed because I gravitated toward people with hyperfocus/special interests, often those with diagnosed ADHD, who could lead conversations. If my special interest was pipe organs, I could deep-dive into detail, appearing socially engaged.

As a child, my elopement tendencies—sneaking away at church to find the pipe organ or band instruments—were also missed. I was fascinated by intricate machines, like the pneumatic tube system at the bank or appliances like ice cream machines, often taking things apart to see inside.

After high school, I aimed for neuroscience to study my colour-sound synaesthesia, but college became too difficult due to the complex classes and the demands of planning ahead, leading me to drop out. Years later, after realizing I was LGBTQIA+ and joining supportive communities, I attempted school again but quit when faced with retaking math.

I'm now on Disability due to another condition, which I believe led to diagnostic overshadowing and prolonged unconscious masking. I am very capable and want to return to work, but I need supports. I dream of a job with extensive job carving that engages my special interest and offers sensory satisfaction from machines—like managing a coffee cart or working a concession stand with popcorn machines. I was previously motivated by tuning pianos, a skill I'm grateful for due to my interest in classical/jazz music.

Have others here had similar experiences, and how were you able to break the cycle of being homebound to finally secure life-long support? I'm struggling with the I/DD waiver requirement to prove adaptive behavior deficits equivalent to an intellectual disability, often needing collateral information from family about a condition that must have originated before age twenty-two.

TSH 6.7 µIU/ml, FT4 normal, TPO 12.1 IU/ml TG 81.7 IU/ml and on 0.25 Levothyroxine.

I always felt like my weight was not fitting my eating habits and overall family-genes vibe. Tests came out, first visit with the Endocrinologist.
He came late, didn't have my results on the computer ready (even though the other doctors and I made sure everything was done within this clinic so everything would be there as fast as it could), was very irritated that I didn't bring the printed-out results.

He asked me a very casual question like ""How do you feel?"", which was already a bit...too generic, since even later he didn't really ask much more. 
I tried guessing what he might want to hear, so I started with my sleep schedule, how I tried every hours imaginable but I only feel ""rested"" after 12h or more and even then I still feel very cranky.
I then mentioned that over the years, even tho I am now a bit overweight (164-5cm+73kg), I feel colder and not warmer with the gained weight.

He only nodded or said something along the lines of ""yeah that's typical for Hashimoto's"".
I tried remembering other stuff, but the moment I mentioned weight he ""locked in"". I told him I usually gain weight easily when stressed and this year was absolutely horrendous for me (uni, work, and my gf coming out as trans so also medical stuff on her side). I gained 10kg in one year, even though I usually hopped between 55-65 (usually on the lower end, when I got to 60kg I was already stressed so 65kg was my MAX) and then suddenly boom 75kg. I mentioned that I'm a very active person, 7-13k steps a day, love playing volleyball, used to go to the gym (not anymore bc of money and time), usually have very active jobs where I walk additional steps and have to be quick all the time.

He asked about my diet.
I mentioned that yeah, I'm a student, I cannot afford much so I'm on a rice and fish diet mostly lately, sometimes chicken with noodles or for a greater feast maybe spaghetti. Still, my portions are really small and I eat maybe 2 times a day qnd ⅓ or ½ the portion my gf does. Sometimes I eat 1 time a day with some yogurt to fill myself up, because the times I ate 3 times a day I only became heavier. No alcohol, no cigarettes or vapes, 3 energy drinks during a week MAX(half an energy drink per day to just not die at school/work bc of low energy and they help me focus + joint pains) even though I try to drink less or none when I am just at home. If I can afford fries and a burger from McD at the beginning of the month that would also be it. When money's tight at the end of the month: cup-noodles 2x. 

As you can see, I track everything I eat very strictly, because I get sick whenever I see myself on the scale and feel guilty whenever I eat one more yogurt even when the hunger is too painful.

The endo started being mad and telling me I should eat potatoes instead of rice, fish and white meat. So...basically my diet without the rice? He added that when I eat pasta it should be whole-grain and no cup-noodles or energy drinks.
He dodged every other symptom I tried to tell him about and went on the whole diet rant as if I wasn't doing most of the things already and still gaining weight.
I got the smallest amount of Levothyroxine prescribed by my family doctor ""until the Endocrinologist will be able to calculate and adjust the right amount""-but during the appointment the Endo said he would not change it, because he could, but won't. I asked why, so he told me we should start with the lowest until we get under 2.9 TSH level which is recommended for my age and gender group. Is it normal or was he actually supposed to calculate my results and propose a different dosage? Am I overreacting when bc of all his behaviors I'm thinking of changing the doctor?

He also told me not to ""complain about my weight"" because that's what ""old ladies always do"" yet he earlier on told me, that old ladies have a max of 4.5 TSH.

I switched to the whole grains, instead of energy drinks, coffee (as he recommended), I'm trying to eat rice fewer times and even my friend joked that I talked about eating rice like ""I was imagining a luxury to eat"".

I'm so fucking sick and tired of always restricting myself-be it money or weight and hearing even more restrictions makes me feel so hopeless. I thought that when the meds start to work maybe I could live nearly like a normal person? Has anyone ever experienced eating like everyone else once the TSH and TPO dropped? I just wanna cling onto some hope that my ""healthiest and best years"" will not be just me polarizing between stressed and active to sleeping too long and restricting myself from everything.

I'm on the meds like a month now, feel no effects whatsoever and after 2 days socializing to maybe ""destress"" a little ended with me 2 days in bed unable to do nearly anything besides a walk to the shop and making food for me and gf, with headaches and random pains or stiff joints.
I saw so many posts with people absolutely ditching gluten-I absolutely hate the gluten free versions of things because I tried them in the past so again, anything enjoyable like bread (which I sometimes eat for breakfast) would turn into mashed sand in my mouth.
I'm very negative about most stuff anyway for some time now even though I'm talking to a psychologist once a month, so I don't think I want to imagine my next year's as more torture for my own mental health's sake so please, tell me there's some hope🙏

1om8hx5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1om8hx5,What can we do about this tiling?,"We’ve been getting our kitchen and bathroom renovated. The contractor is pretty much done with a few finishing touches left. We went to check on the progress and find the workmanship on the kitchen backsplash to be a bit sloppy (first photo). For one, the fridge used to be in this area but we’ve moved it to the other side of the kitchen. An indent was made by the builders for the fridge and we’ve asked the contractor to even the wall out with drywall to make it flat. When they forgot to do it, we said oh well because we were planning to put our coffee station there so the extra inch or so would provide itty bitty more counter space and we didn’t want to make a big deal out of it. 

However, the corner for the indent now looks sloppy and I’m not a huge fan of the bullnose. The bullnose I can live with — it’s the jaggedness with the sides of the tile sticking out that is bothering us. Before you come at me, I am completely aware that this is the nature of the zellige tiles I chose. I know they’re not going to be perfectly aligned, but we had zellige tiles installed by them in our bathrooms too. They look great and the sides don’t stick out past the bullnose like these do. We brought it up with our contractor. He acknowledges they need to caulk the bottom where the tiles meet the counter top, but he doesn’t think it’s sloppy. However, if we share how unhappy we are, he will redo it for us.

I do want to make a final note that we think the kitchen backsplash was rushed. The renovation went 2 months past the original deadline. When the bathroom was done (over the summer), they were still on schedule and we really liked their tiling work then. We know they have other projects going on and noticed the progress on our place slowing (there’d be days where no one was scheduled to work on the house). We anticipated delays but gave them a new hard deadline set at the end of October (our lease was coming to an end and we needed to move back in).

That said, I’m really not trying to make him retile this corner. It looks fine from a far (second photo), but it’s pretty noticeable even standing at counter distance. Is there anything else we can do to make this look better?

I booked my KKKL Express ticket online. Easily payable via European credit card. 
Trip can be rescheduled for 2 RM ONCE. 

HOW TO GET THERE 
I booked the 9AM Bus from TBS - Penang 
The TBS terminal is straight forward. 
I arrived 1h before at Level 1 Arrival (it is grabs suggestion and it is correct). The traffic was busy and it took a little longer to get there than google anticipated. 
From there you walk 5-10 minutes to the 
counter hall. 

COUNTER HALL
If your pdf comes with a QR barcode you can directly head to the departure hall (1 escalator from counter hall). 
If it does not, there are plenty of counters you can check in. I lined up and asked. It would have taken around 5 minutes to check in. 
There are some food and coffee stalls in the counter hall. Get it here if you need, there will not be any in the departure hall. However, there are clean toilets down there. 

DEPARTURE HALL
There are several gates in the departure hall. When you scan your barcode to enter the hall, you will see the gate you need to go to. There are buses leaving the gates every few minutes. My bus was scheduled at 9AM and from 8:15 to 9:00, there were two other busses leaving from the same gate. 

For those you read their ticket carefully:
- It is not necessary to be there 1h before. Just be there 30min before and you will be fine. 
- You don’t need to wear a mask 

DRIVE
The bus left perfectly on time. However, the traffic was crazy and it took us 6:30h to each Penang Sentral (Butterworth side at the ferry). The bus stops once to allow you to go to the toilet. No food was available. Get your food before if you plan to eat on the road. 
The seats are comfortable and there is easily enough space for my 1.91m. 
There are no USB sockets and no entertainment system.

CONCLUSION
I already took the Aeroline bus before. For me, both buses are perfectly fine. Don’t take the bus if you are on a tight schedule. I will consider flying next time. Which is cheaper than taking the train.

Tuesday: Land @ 4 PM... our 1st hotel is in Piccadilly Circus... thinking of going to Bun House in Chinatown and then Mamasons Dirty Ice Cream. And then getting a drink at Gordon's Wine Bar... 

Wednesday: grab coffee somewhere, grab Yum Yums at Greggs Holborn, drop off bags at 2nd hotel near Park Lane, check out Buckingham Palace late morning Skygarden (if not raining), check out Tower of London Poppy installation, Tower Bridge, Old Spitalfields for Lunch, London Bridge, Tate Modern (maybe we want to go to at least 1 museum but are stuck between that and Victoria & Albert to see the Marie Antoinette stuff)\*, Pick & Cheese Seven Dials for dinner, and then I really want to try the sticky date Madelines at Henri

Thursday: Paris

Friday: Breakfast at Permit Room Portobello, peruse Portobello market, Might check out Victoria & Albert (if we don't end up checking out Tate Modern), grab snacks at Supermarket of Dreams, Brixton Market, Fish, Wings and Tings for lunch while there, drinks at Duke of Edinburgh. Rest, Dinner at Noisy Oyster (has anyone been, I can only find influencer reviews), a HiFi spot in the area would be nice for after dinner, if not we were thinking of going back south to Jumbi. 

  
Saturday: Any breakfast/brunch recommendations in Dalston or Hackney please, Camden Passage/and or Broadway Market/, check out Museum of the Home (if time permits, so many free museums so little time) either Dough Hands or Sonora Taqueria (I know Sonora will be packed... what is the average wait time?), God's Own Junkyard (is that too ambitious), grab a drink somewhere in the area, dinner at Tom's or FKABAM. And then if we didn't try Henri's dessert Wednesday then this night, or maybe a late night Beigel, probably will have nightcap at hotel.

Sunday: Head home

We also plan on window shopping, and checking out the Christmas stuff at Harrod's and Selfridges, but if any other places have great ornaments, please let us know. Also someone told me Mark & Spencer was a great place to shop for bras, can anyone confirm this?

(Her husband is unemployed)

It opened the larger realization that she won't show how her family has paid any of their bills the last two years and reporters can't be bothered to ask, despite admitting the same reporters believe they have been lied to by Katie and her family.

What is going on?

Who would pay for this family's costs without expecting something in return?

This matters.[ Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh had a ton of debt vanish when he was appointed to the court and no one knows who did it. ](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/09/the-many-mysteries-of-brett-kavanaughs-finances/)

Here is the story that opened this can of questions:

""“They send me a check periodically to help with the child care expenses,” she said, adding that daycare for her toddler costs around $2,200 a month. She did not say precisely how much her parents contribute, noting that she does not keep track. When pressed, she said money arrives every couple of months.""

After a weekend of probably a thousand edgy Slack meetings they fully flipped the fudge out. They called in a lifeline having The Stranger write a piece attacking KUOW and the reporter for, again, quoting Katie Wilson. (KUOW was nagged into editing the story, but nothing factual changed)

In the Stranger piece, her mother states they only gave her money for daycare, nothing else. Remember this fact.

In the meantime redditor [u/Blue\_HyperGiant](https://www.reddit.com/user/Blue_HyperGiant/) does a great analysis of Wilson's non profit and campaign financial statements and concludes that any evidence of recent years income cannot be found. ""[ Wilson Income Sources - All In One Place : r/SeattleWA](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/1oi1wg9/wilson_income_sources_all_in_one_place/)

Then David Kroman at the Times, who has covered this race like he is being slipped sleeping pills on the hour in his cheap SeaTimes newsroom Nespresso coffee, then dropped this actual bomb: Wilson's parents told him LAST MONTH that they did not financially support Wilson. Uh oh...that is inconvenient given Katie and her mother just told reporters they've been covering her daycare costs since announcing she was running.

Oopsie?

""I think the KUOW was good and the payments are a great detail for the public to consider. When I talked to her parents in early September they told me they don’t give her money and Wilson hadn’t asked. Maybe they were misremembering but that’s two months, which is a bit different than two years imo"" 

He even says he thinks they are lying to him...

Receipt:[ Post by u/kromandavid.bsky.social — Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/kromandavid.bsky.social/post/3m4a32umavc2r)

In the meantime, Wilson makes a video to explain her mother paid, by \[rubs bridge of nose\] bringing her mother on camera.  They don't refute anything, they don't produce files showing how much money she has received from her parents or other sources. NOTHING.

C'mon.

What does Kroman do when he thinks the campaign lied to him about something as important as who is paying the bills of someone running for office?  He has two more cups of coffee, takes a nap under his desk, and files a story about city owned grocery stores the weekend before the election. 

Fast forward to two days ago. Wilson is posting comments backpedaling from her passing on a question asking if she would remove encampments from parks and I ask this:

""What is your source of income the last two years? Besides your parents paying for daycare to let you campaign, how did you pay your living expenses? This analysis leaves giant holes in your finances and voters should know before you take a job that will have special interests wanting favors."" 

NO ANSWER. But her kind, normal, and clearly happy followers welcomed the question to tune of 80+ down votes. (It was ultimately had positive votes because some crazy folks do want to know who is paying candidates expenses)

So here we are, a few days from an election for Mayor and we have:

1. Katie Wilson refusing to say who has paid her family's living expenses for 2+ years.
2. Reporters who are paid to cover this race both admitting they were lied to on this topic and not caring to answer
3. Her followers downvoting any asking into oblivion on the other Seattle sub.

1om8fbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cigars_Australia/comments/1om8fbo/so_you_want_to_build_a_cigar_collection/,So you want to build a cigar collection,"Like any hobby, some people get into cigars and get really excited and want to go and spend all their money on all the new shinies, not knowing what they're getting into. Just look at the number of Warhammer 40k armies on Facebook Marketplace and tell me I'm wrong.

The cost of cigars in Australia makes it difficult for all but the richest of us (bastards) or those that have been collecting back in a happier time when the hobby was affordable (also bastards) to 'overcollect' as such, but it's still quite easy to over-buy and end up with a hodgepodge collection of things that you didn't like or have grown out of.

I have a collection of a couple hundred sticks - a size that some would call 'small' and others would call 'outrageous' - and while I don't regret my choices per se (I did my research coming in so the majority of my cigars are at least a certain quality even if they're not my favourites today), there are certainly different decisions I would have made along the journey (e.g. looking into Cubans earlier).

Whether you're just starting out, or an experienced collector, here are some lessons and things to keep in mind.

# Acknowledge that you have a problem

I don't mean smoking (we can leave that can of worms well out of this subreddit thank you). I mean the natural urge, when you start or have a hobby, to want all the things.

In a happier time, that might have been possible for an ordinary person. The current reality is that we don't have the weather climate, the regulatory climate, the exchange rate, etc. to go buying and hoarding like some people over in r/cigars can do in places like the American Midwest or more enlightened European countries.

Ironically for a luxury good like cigars, we don't have the luxury of making too many bad calls.

You can still build a handsome collection of sticks you actually want to smoke, even in Australia. The secret is to **buy** ***smarter***, not ***more***.

# You don't need to have a big collection to enjoy cigars

Over in r/cigars you may see people talking about having 3 cigars a day or more. In Australia, only the most cashed up of us with the biggest collections (bastards) would be able to afford that kind of pace. For most of us, a cigar is a more drawn out indulgence - a cap to a weekend, or every couple of days at best.

You don't need to have a big collection with stacks of boxes to enjoy cigars. With a big collection includes investing in storage (tupperdors for those of us that are cheap, winedors for those that are willing to play, Rachings for those of us with money (bastards)), humidification controls, worrying about ambient temperature, worrying about tobacco beetles and mould, wondering if you've been sitting on a particular box for too long and if it's aged too long, indecision when you actually go to enjoy one because you have too many to choose from, etc. Not everyone has the time or inclination for all that.

If you average say a cigar a week, with a couple of extras if friends come over, you can quite easily get away with having say \~25 cigars on hand at any given time, thrown in a tupperdor with a few bovedas, and placing top-up orders when needed. If you have some favourites and want whole boxes, an airtight Bunnings storage container with more bovedas could comfortably see you through \~100 cigars (say 20-30 loose and 3 boxes). If you want to splash out on storage, you can go the winedor route with a free or cheap wine fridge off Facebook Marketplace, or an electric humidor off Amazon for $200-300 that will fit a collection of that size (don't waste your time with cheap wooden humidors, they may look nice, but they're almost universally bad).

The point is: **what makes a cigar enthusiast a cigar enthusiast is their enjoyment of cigars, not the size of their collection.**

# Try before you buy

You could jump onto Neptune right now and buy a box of (say) [Davidoff Winston Churchill Late Hour Robusto ](https://www.neptunecigar.com/cigars/davidoff-winston-churchill-late-hour-robusto)(I picked this at random because it had the weight in grams). They often have sales so if you wait a few weeks you might even be able to knock say 10% off. Great, you say, a box of premium cigars for $494 USD (about $755 AUD) after discount! You'll probably need to pay about $46 USD ($70 AUD) in shipping though.

Then it arrives. You get pinged at the border, so you pay about $835 in tobacco tax and GST. Now your total investment is $1,660. There are a range of Australian vendors that will sell you the same box for cheaper - Cigar Hut and Cigar World are about $350 cheaper, The Index about $200 cheaper, and others are around as well. So you've overpaid. Fine. You put the cigar to rest after its long journey for a few weeks and wait in anticipation. At least the cigar will be good, right?

Then you light up... and it's not for you. Maybe the flavour profile isn't to your liking, or it's too strong and knocks you off your feet. Maybe it'll age out of those problems, or maybe not.

All you know now is that you've got a box of 19 of these things taking up space, that may or may not come good one day.

How do you avoid this fate? **Try before you buy** and, **if you're going to buy boxes, only buy things you like**.

If you'd like to try a particular cigar, or a particular brand, buy a range of singles (or doubles, so you can try them at different times or in different circumstances e.g. 6 months apart, after different meals, with different pairings, etc.). Work through them and identify the cigars that you like. You may even be able to identify *why* you like certain cigars - do you like coffee notes? Chocolate? Cream? Berry? - to help guide you into other buying decisions.

[You can buy singles from basically any Australian vendor, and most of them have free shipping after a couple of cigars.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cigars_Australia/comments/1nv0ia0/buying_cigars_from_inside_of_australia_a/) There are also samplers, both from manufacturers and vendors, which have been prepared to provide a more curated experience, and can be a good way to experience a range of different cigars, usually at a slight discount to buying them as singles.

Yes, buying singles (or samplers) from an Australian seller will be more expensive than ordering overseas, but spending the extra $20-30 on a single locally is cheaper than spending $1,000 buying a box that isn't for you. If you're in a position to visit in person, the sales staff should also be able to help you in your buying decisions.

Not all interesting cigars are going to be available in Australia. If that's the case ([or you just want to play the ABF gauntlet](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cigars_Australia/comments/1kn2ldg/buying_cigars_from_outside_of_australia_a/)), sites like Neptune, Smoking Pipes, and COH, will ship singles to Australia as well.

Only commit to boxes that you've tried and decided you actually want to have around.

# Not all cigars from the same brand are the same

Try the Davidoff Winston Churchill The Late Hour Robusto mentioned earlier, and then try a Davidoff 2000. Or a My Father Connecticut, then a My Father Le Bijou 1922. Or a Cohiba Behike 52 (if you can afford it (bastard)) and then a Siglo II.

These may be the same brand, but they are far from the same cigars.

There are two lessons from this.

Firstly, **don't write off a brand just because you didn't like one particular cigar from them.** It is true that many cigar brands have certain commonalities across their line, and boutique brands may be more likely to hone in on one particular profile. But there are also many brands that will have such a wide variety across their offerings that it's impossible to say that they have a single profile. Trying multiple cigars, and comparing flavour profiles, is the only way to narrow down both what you like, and what your preferences are in general.

Secondly, **don't assume that because you liked one cigar, that you'll like everything from that brand**. If you liked the My Father Connecticut, don't buy a box of Le Bijou 1922 expecting the same out of them. You will be disappointed. You will even find differences between the same cigar in say robusto sized compared to its equivalent Churchill - ring gauge, the ratio of wrapper surface area versus filler, etc. can lead to surprising changes even though it's the same underlying blend.

As you get more experienced, you may be able to read reviews of the strength and tasting notes of different cigars and make educated guesses as to what you will like. But even then, it's no guarantee.

Many brands offer samplers that will let you experience a range of different profiles. Be open to trying these samplers. You'll get a feel for what you may like or not like within a range. Some brands even offer cigars that are the same blend bar one change e.g. the same blend with a Connecticut wrapper versus a Maduro wrapper. Not only can the samplers help you with a brand, they may also be able to help you explore what specific tobacco types appeal to you.

# Do your research

While we can typically guess what a cigar's price should be, there's still enough range and variety between vendors to make it worthwhile to do your research. Supply and demand means that different vendors will put the same cigar up at different prices depending on how many they have, how many of their buyers actually want them, etc.

To find the best price on a cigar from local sources, I will usually start by putting the cigar name into Google and adding 'site:.au', to limit the results to websites where the domain name ends in .au. From there, I skim through the results and check the prices from the websites that I personally trust and that from experience generally have reasonable prices.

Remember to factor in shipping cost as well. For example, if you're looking at say half a dozen cigars, you may find that Cigar Hut is cheapest on two, The Index cheapest on two, and Firmin Cigars cheapest on the final two. But if you bought two cigars from each, you wouldn't make the minimum spend for free shipping from any of them, so your total costs would go up with all that extra shipping. It may be cheaper to buy everything from one vendor so you save on shipping, even if that means you're paying more than the absolute-bottom-dollar price for some of the cigars.

Similarly, you may just find some vendors better than others.

You may also find that singles or boxes may not always be the cheapest option e.g. if you want some of your favourites, and most or all of them appear in a sampler, it may be cheaper to buy multiples of the sampler than buy separately or in a box. Or it may be cheaper (weirdly) to buy lots of singles than buy a box. Follow the unit price.

**Danger:** When doing this, it is almost inevitable that you will also come across some websites with pricing that is 'too good to be true' e.g. the box you wanted for $500 instead of $1,500. Unfortunately, scam sites exist, even with .au domain names (often these are registered fraudulently using someone else's details). To stay safe, stick to known vetted and safe vendors. If you *are* prepared to go with an unfamiliar vendor, [do your due diligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cigars_Australia/wiki/staying-safe-buying-cigars-online/).

# Don't assume overseas is meaningfully cheaper

There's a general assumption that overseas will always be cheaper (before taking tax into account). This will frequently be the case. However, there are cases (particularly for Cubans and for the more premium end) where local may still be cheaper, or at least competitive enough on pricing that there's limited benefit in buying overseas versus locally.

Cigar Hut currently has the H Upmann Royal Robusto LCDH for $719 a box. They are currently out of stock in many places but, if they were in stock, they would be at LCDH St Kitt's for $395 USD ($604 AUD), EGM for €361 ($639 AUD), and Cuban Lou's for $475 USD ($726 AUD) - and all of those prices are before tax, which would be around the $340 mark. These particular cigars aren't for me (I thought about it for a long time though), but if I wanted to buy them, I'd be inclined to buy local and be done with it, than play games buying overseas.

Alternatively, would you like a box of Trinidad Esmereldas? You can buy one from iHavanas for $945 USD ($1,445 AUD) before tax. Or you can buy a box from The Index today (well, tomorrow, because today is a Sunday and they're closed) for $1,476.

Make sure you look at what it is you're actually buying - both pre and post tax - and what's available locally, before clicking that 'pay' button.

# Follow the sales

Cigars are expensive for us, so we need to spend our money wisely. If we don't *need* the cigars today, and holding out for the best price can save us a few bucks, we don't need many of those discounts to stack before we can afford another box.

If I recall correctly, it's not legal for Australian vendors to advertise discounts to the public. So you'll need to be on the ball. For example, I believe the Index simply publishes on their Facebook stories 'These are the special cigars this week' without advertising a specific discount, while Cigar Hut shares discounts through a newsletter which you sign up for (and so isn't to the public).

Overseas vendors aren't so limited. iHavanas is famous for its monthly (ish) promotions, if you check the site periodically, you will see what they have on sale. Neptune and Smoking Pipes also run promotions knocking 10-20% off their ordinary prices with some frequency. Of course, you still need to factor in tax at the border.

# Don't get suckered in by sales

Sales are there to move volume for the vendor - not for you to save money.

Just because there's a sale, doesn't mean you'll get the best price. As above, vendors will sell based on supply and demand. One vendors' sale price may be another vendors' Tuesday price.

This is especially the case when looking overseas. I covered this in the [buying cigars in Australia guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cigars_Australia/comments/1nv0ia0/buying_cigars_from_inside_of_australia_a/). There were a bunch of cigars on promotion via iHavanas at the time. As it turned out, of the 7 that were discounted at iHavanas at the time, it was still cheaper (on the order of $100's) to buy more than half of them locally after you'd factored in the border tax.

Don't buy just because it's cheap(er). Buy because you want it.

# The only person whose opinion on your collection matters, is you

A collection's no good unless it contains things you actually like.

As I've gotten more into the hobby, I've certainly changed (for the most part) how I buy my cigars:

* buying and trying singles first to avoid buying boxes of something I'm not going to like
* tracking my tasting notes and preferences to be able to make more educated guesses about other cigars I might like
* maintaining a list of cigars I would actually be interested in buying boxes of, and waiting for opportunities to buy
* focusing on the quality of my collection to me, not just the volume of options
* if I do buy a box of something new based on a sale or it being limited edition, doing so because I've compared the prices, done the review and tasting notes research, and think it is a worthwhile gamble that I can afford because I haven't spent all my money chasing volume - rather than buying 'because it's there'

I don't post often but I thought my experience might help others.

Me, 76 year old male who has never been put under for anything and has never had any surgery or even been in a hospital since birth. Still have my same high school weight and pant size. My whole lifestyle has been very active with most of the time spent working outdoors on our ranch. Spent many hours transferring 7 ton of hay from the flatbed to the barn by hand. On and off tractors and other equipment. Tending to horses and other animals. Fixing fences in all kinds of  weather. In younger days, swimming, water skying, mountain climbing, snow skiing and spelunking was our recreation. All very strenuous activities. We try to live a healthy lifestyle, keep very fit, no drugs of any kind, prescribed or otherwise, eat healthy foods and drink from our ""fountain of youth"" natural spring water flowing from the ground with all it's natural minerals.

About 10 years ago I noticed a slight bulge on the right side of my groin area. No pain ever, just an awareness sometimes. Several years later noticed a slight bulge on the left side. As time went on the right side bulge was getting larger. It would disappear when I lied down. With my engineering background and logical thinking I came to the conclusion that I need help fixing this problem. I knew if it strangulated when I was out in the wilderness, many hours or days from help, it would become life threatening. I decided I would op for scheduled surgery instead of risking a potential life threatening emergency. I don't recall any particular move or lift that triggered my hernias.

Day 1

Had wife drop me off at 6:20 am at the hospital entrance as I didn't want her to be exposed to any pathogens. I was escorted to pre op nurse area. Got through paperwork. Taken to a private room. Told to disrobe completely including underwear, put on a hospital gown, cap and nonslip booty socks. Nurse left room and closed the door and told me to open the door when I was in my gown.

This is the part I was dreading the most. I almost decided to forgo the operation thinking about this for many months. Being naked and exposed to many strangers that were going to prep me for surgery and be touching my private parts and working close to them. Plus, we all know what a stressful situation does to a man's anatomy, it's worse than a dip in an ice water bath. I felt embarrassed and humiliated. I know, I know, that the doctors and nurses have seen it all before and are only focused on fixing what you need help with, but that being said, they need to treat patients with respect and give you as much privacy as possible without impeding their mission. With respect to my team, the doctor and nurses were at the top of their profession and cared for me in a loving compassionate manner and went out of their way to make me as comfortable with the situation as possible. My hats off to all of them!

I'm a man of principals. We stopped flying when TSA started molesting people at check-in. I was almost arrested when I stepped in and stopped them from molesting my wife many years ago. No flying ever again since that moment!

Still in the private room, nurse puts the IV in my hand, doctor and anesthesiologist check in with me before anesthesiologist says it's time and pops a vial into my IV. I thought I would at least see all these strangers that would be working on me in the operating room and see what the operating room looked like as they wheeled me in.

Not to be, in what I thought was a momentary blink of my eyes, when they opened the nurse was asking me how I was doing. I said fine but when are you taking me to the operating room? She said, were done and everything went fine! Now I'm missing 2.5 hours of time. No counting backwards from 10, no seeing any of the surgery team or operating room. Did not see them shaving me for the surgery or anything else.

I felt really good and hungry. They gave me some water, juice and crackers. I was not in any pain. When the nurse felt comfortable with my recovery she said she would help me get dressed. I declined, I didn't need any more embarrassment. Fortunately my wife arrived at that moment and the nurse left the room to give me privacy. This is when I realized that there was no way that I could have bent over to get dressed by myself! Trying to get my underwear and pants on alone would have been mission impossible! I left the hospital sock booties on and with my wife's help was able to get dressed and slip into my loafers. Nurse brought in the the wheelchair and wheeled me out the private side exit used for departing patients. I very gingerly slid into the seat and we left for home.

Arrived home at 1:15 pm. Gingerly got out of the car myself and walked up a couple of stairs into the house. Started eating light foods and drinking water and juice. Doc said I could eat anything I wanted to. Still not having any pain. Yes, I felt pain if I coughed or was in the process of trying to sit down or get up. I did have a sore throat, as they warned me about, due to the breathing tube they put in while your under.  Doc said no shower for two days, only sponge bath. Doc said keep moving regularly, so I would get up and walk couple of laps around the inside of the house every 30 minutes of so. Used my arms to help myself get up and down in and out of chairs. The counter collection of pill bottles, including heavy duty pain meds and Tylenol, remain unopened! Slept in a reclining chair to make it easier for me to get upright again.

Day 2

Up at 5:30 am. Made some coffee and had some toast for breakfast. Slept fairly well. Today I ventured outside, walked around the barn a couple of times and then back to the house for more food. Still no pain, other than getting up or down, and pill bottles remain unopened. No pain when walking or going up or down the stairs full stride. Spent the afternoon in my shop doing some light organizing.

Took off the12"" Panel Binder that they gave me to wear snugly around my waist and abdomen to help keep things in place while I heal to see how things looked. Only three tiny incisions about 1/2"" wide were made horizontally. One right below the belly button, another 2.5"" or so below it and the third another 2"" further down all covered with small band-aids. No swelling or discoloration. A look in the mirror is not pretty! With all the shaving they did down there no wonder I still feel naked even while dressed!

I plan on sleeping in the recliner again tonight.

Summary: I am very pleased with my progress. I'm so glad I had it taken care of, even with the privacy and dignity issues that I had to process from my side. I highly recommend it for anyone that has this type of hernia. I plan on hopping onto the tractor and jumping over fences in a few short months!",3,1762058141.0,Hernia,0,1.0,False

After that age I got physically beaten up by my classmates and ever since I’ve been feeling I’m never good enough. I lost the skill of making deep connection and am now in my begin 30s.

I should be happy on paper, I finally got a girlfriend who loves me, working remotely and financially stable.

However, I’m always comparing myself to others. It’s never enough and never am I feeling happy. The whole situation got amplified recently when I got to live in the same condo with a guy who my brother had introduced as he lives in the same city. This guy, is in crypto and does extremely well financially and so do his friends who live in the same building.

I feel less and started having panic attacks when encountering them and sweating a lot on my forehead. I’ve also noticed that the two of them are often doing things but never invite me, like going for coffee.

Now I’m in the stage that I think they find me weird and really don’t know what to do. My life feels like it’s passing by and I’m wasting it because of this stupid narrative that I tell myself and is so heavy emotionally loaded.

I pray I can keep my kind heart and never become bitter, but this is getting hard. I don’t know what’s wrong with me or why dating feels impossible.

I have a great career. I’m completely financially independent. I stay in shape — slim, natural hourglass figure. I’m not a supermodel, but I think I have a pretty face. On dating apps, men always say the same thing: “You’re more attractive than anyone I’ve met here.” I’m warm, fun, intelligent, transparent, and easy to talk to — their words, not mine.

I’ve only slept with one man since my divorce, and even he still reaches out, saying it was the best sex of his life. I say that just to show: it’s not like I’m detached or cold. Still, nothing sticks.

For context: I’m 36, divorced, and have one child. I mostly date divorced dads or men 40+ who are open to kids. Some are emotionally needy. Some are emotionally unavailable. Some don’t try at all. The one I actually cared for said he “doesn’t want a relationship right now.” It’s been two years of this, and I don’t get it.

I’m Black — maybe that plays a role, but these men know that before they ask me out, so who knows.

I’m tired of hearing how amazing I am. It doesn’t matter if no one chooses me. My coworkers adore me, kids naturally gravitate to me, strangers have literally bought me flowers out of nowhere. I make people feel seen, safe, and cared for — but I can’t seem to find someone who wants to stay.

I’m so lonely. I don’t want a relationship just to have one. I want to love and be loved back. I want to make someone coffee in the morning, send him a flirty picture during the day, celebrate our wins, and be there when life gets hard.

I know I’m not perfect, but I genuinely believe I have most of what it takes for a healthy relationship. I just can’t figure out why I’m still alone.",15,1762057659.0,Divorce,8,0.89,False

1om86b4,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1om86b4/learned_people_skills_the_hard_way_so_you_dont/,Learned people skills the hard way so you don’t have to: 9 lessons that actually made me likeable,"Let’s be real. Most of us were never *taught* how to do people skills. It wasn’t part of the school curriculum. It wasn’t modeled well at home. And now we’re in a world that demands charisma, EQ, and “good vibes only” just to get basic things like dates, jobs, or even friendship replies.

What’s wild is how common this is. I’ve noticed even highly intelligent or successful people silently struggle with social anxiety, being misunderstood, or just not knowing how to “click” with others. TikTok is a mess of fake alpha male advice, or vibe-over-substance videos pushing charisma hacks that feel more manipulative than genuine.

This guide isn’t about “being nice” or forcing yourself to be someone you’re not. Everything here is pulled from research-backed insights, top-tier books, and brutally honest observations from both psychology and the social skill trenches. Let’s level up your likeability, deepen your connections, and make people actually enjoy being around you—without selling your soul.

Here are 9 no-BS lessons and resources that will actually raise your people skills:

1. **People don’t remember words, they remember *feelings***  
The most socially magnetic people I know aren’t the smartest or best looking. They’re the ones who make others feel seen. Social psychologist Dr. Heidi Grant Halvorson found that people decide in *seconds* whether you’re trustworthy or not—based on warmth before competence.  
So saying something “smart” doesn’t matter if your vibe is cold or transactional. Instead, focus on presence. Slow down your speech. Be *curious*, not clever. Ask questions like “What made you get into that?” instead of “Cool, what do you do?” That tiny shift makes people open up emotionally.

2. **You can’t fake social calibration. You have to *feel* it.**  
This is where most fail. Faking confidence without reading the emotional temperature of a room is how you end up being “that guy.” One powerful tip comes from Vanessa Van Edwards (author of *Captivate*, and lead researcher at Science of People). She teaches that decoding microexpressions—tiny flashes of emotion—can help you adjust your energy before you say the wrong thing.  
People are always broadcasting their comfort levels. You just have to learn to listen to body language more than words.

3. **Play status games wisely**  
Social skills are nothing without understanding status dynamics. High-status people don’t *brag*, they understate. But they also don’t defer too much. Learn to speak in *declarative* sentences (“I loved that docuseries”) versus “hedgy” ones (“I kinda liked it I guess?”).  
Dr. David Buss’ research on attraction shows that status-signaling through confidence AND humility is deeply attractive—especially when paired with assertive listening. That’s not just hearing, but engaging with power and presence.

4. **Try to make learning people skills addictive**  
There’s a science to becoming more socially fluent, and one app that helped me rewire this is *Charisma on Command’s YouTube channel*. Their frameworks for “social momentum” and “the likability loop” are gold. But instead of passively consuming videos, I recommend using apps that *train* you with interaction-based learning.

5. **Practice mirroring… but not like a sociopath**  
Mirroring body language, tone, and pacing can create deep subconscious rapport (as shown in studies from the Journal of Nonverbal Behavior), *but* people can smell manipulation. Instead, train yourself to match someone’s energy when appropriate, then *lead* it somewhere warmer or more engaged.  
This technique is used by hostage negotiators and therapists—especially outlined in Chris Voss’ *Never Split the Difference*. Mastering this skill will make you instantly more trustworthy.

6. **This book will make you rethink everything about social success**  
*The Like Switch* by Dr. Jack Schafer (former FBI agent) is the best book I’ve ever read on how to build rapport, gain trust, and detect manipulation. He introduces the “Friendship Formula,” which boils down to proximity, frequency, duration, and intensity of connection moments.  
What shocked me was how easy it is to become charismatic just by adjusting *timing and attention* within conversations. Hands-down most actionable book on likability. FBI tested. Zero fluff.

7. **You don’t need 100 friends. You need 3 real ones**  
A powerful insight came from researcher Robin Dunbar (famous for Dunbar’s number). He found that most people can only maintain stable social relationships with around 150 people—but only 3-5 are true inner circle.  
Instead of chasing popularity, build depth. Ask better questions. Instead of “Let’s hang,” say “I’ve been thinking about that thing you said last time—want to grab coffee and dive into it?” Be the person who *remembers*.

8. **Let your media diet shape your social mind**  
Most people learn social skills through trial and error. Speed that up by filling your ears with expert-level social psychology insights. My recs:  
• *The Art of Charm* podcast – super tactical, features FBI experts, dating coaches, exec mentors  
• *Modern Wisdom* with Chris Williamson – goes deep into the science of status, charisma, and self-perception  
• *People School* by Vanessa Van Edwards (online course) – interactive modules that retrain how you show up  
• *BeFreed* is a next gen learning app I started using when I got serious about improving this stuff. It’s powered by AI and actually builds you a personalized learning roadmap. It turns deep books, expert talks, and research like “Like Switch” or “Captivate” into bite-size audio lessons. You can even choose the length or voice of your host.  
What blew my mind is it adapts based on what I listen to, and recommends new routes like “How to master high-stakes conversations” or “Decode power signals in groups.” It covered every book I mentioned above, and helped me practice through spaced repetition. Perfect if you’re busy but want a deep social upgrade.

9. **Don’t fake confidence. Build “earned confidence” over time**  
People can feel when you’re insecure but hiding it. The fix is to create small wins daily that reinforce a stable sense of competence. Start with 30 second interactions. Ask for the time. Compliment a stranger’s outfit. Exit gracefully.  
Over time, these micro interactions create *confidence momentum*. True social ease is trained, not born. And it gets easier when you challenge yourself in low-stakes environments.

---

Every social win compounds. You’re not trying to become “the most liked person in the room.” You’re just learning to master the art of making people *want* to talk to you again.

1om83h8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1om83h8/spousal_discretionary_spending_me_41m_and_my_wife/,Spousal discretionary spending (Me (41M) and my wife (38F)),"I’ve been in a relationship with my wife for approx. 17 years, and 15 of those married. From the onset of our marriage our accounts and single credit card have been joint, with full transparency on savings, expenditures and investments. Furthermore, I was employed and we married (2010) before she graduated University (2011), and so I contributed reasonably to pay off her student debt. By year two of marriage we were completely debt free with a little nest egg, and plans to enter the real estate market.

Thankfully, at this juncture we were both working making comparable salaries, and feeling an equilibrium regarding household contributions. 

As a sidebar, due to a childhood of meagre means she developed a moderate level of financial anxiety being brought up in a family that lived off of overdraft. while I grew up the same I didn’t develop the same mindset, and understood my parents did what they could with five children, but also stood on my own vowing to not fall in the same financial picture.

This said, at this point (2011) she wanted to buy a house and I actually convinced her not to until we had a bit more of a generous down payment (at that point we literally had zilch). I then further demonstrated through calculations that for the time being this was the best decision for us, not to mention my work would likely (and it did) move us geographically. She agreed and we were on the plan of getting a reasonable down payment (my understanding at the time was maybe 10 to 15%).

So we move (2012), I’m ready to buy and we have the savings to support it, and now she wishes to have at least a 50% down payment for our first home. I can’t tell you how frustrating this seemingly innocuous disagreement was, and how she went from eager to enter the market w/o a down payment, to wanting a 50% down payment in a rapidly increasing housing market (houses started to rise again post recession). So I went back to what had worked previously and showed the calculations to show that mortgaging (rates were great then) in lieu of a larger down payment, and investing the extra cash, we would be better off. The pitch did not take and she was convinced the path to financial freedom was a larger down payment. Going against everything I believed in terms of financial stewardship with inherent and necessary risk, I resigned to the fact that we would be waiting to buy until we had reached the down payment goal. 

So years go by, six of them. In those years I practiced a financial discipline that far exceeded what I thought was necessary, and we end up socking away nearly $400K. For some reading this might not be a lot, but for the salaries we had and the fact we reached this in six years while still living some semblance of a life, was insane. In this time frame EVERYTHING is financially monitored (by her): buying coffee, eating out, buying alcohol, you name it, it was looked at and questioned. Did I say anything? Sure I would cock an eyebrow sometimes, but in all honesty I loved my wife and was OK taking the L and going with her plan, especially given her anxiety on finances.

Finally, and only because she got pregnant, and I pushed for it, we look for a home in 2018. At this point she is thinking we can buy our house cash, I on the other hand am thinking I didn’t wait this long to settle, we can handle a small mortgage let’s get something we can enjoy. So after much house hunting and looking at row houses, duplexes and single-family homes, I talk her into a single-family home at the price tag of $565K. We agree on using $350K from our savings and mortgaging the rest, $215K.

So now one might think with all the saving that has occurred, and finally buying a house there’s no longer a reason to be stressing our relationship and ourselves out, saving at such an excessive rate. Wrong. Instead, she has now convinced herself and trying to convince me that we need to pay off our house as quick as possible. I’m having difficulty understanding how we’ve come to this point with such a reasonable mortgage in comparison to our household income. But by whatever force, only God knows, I agree and we start aggressively paying off the house. The financial discipline required (remember we have a child now) is comparable to when we were saving for the original down payment. It took us four years to pay off the remainder. In that time, we also had two more children, who I love very much. This said, I felt at that point surely we can breathe a little bit and spend our money on ourselves perhaps a bit more frivolously than in the past.

But it’s not been like that at all. In fact, it’s been the same regime that it was saving up for the down payment and then finally paying off the mortgage. Have I completely done nothing? No, I golf occasionally, I’ll eat out once in a while. But truly, nothing excessive at all, and still in the grand scheme of a very conservative spending footprint, all while still feeling like I’m being reviewed by the auditor general. This is the point where I started to question whether or not my wife and I could truly have a joint financial picture together. There was no question of our marriage, but just whether or not the dynamics of our current financial management picture was sound (2022).

Over the next 2 1/2 to almost 3 years the above trend continues where I feel like there is a noose around my neck as it pertains to personal discretionary spending. I feel like every expenditure that I make is being looked at through online banking, credit card statements, and even questioned when I’m taking loose cash out of the bank. For most of our relationship, I have made 20 to 30% more than my wife, but I’ve never leveraged that above her and never would. But what I have yearned for and have never had in this relationship is an ability to expend funds without the direct or indirect feeling that I am being judged, criticized, or audited on how I spend even a small fraction of my money.

And so we are 2025, and I decided to get my own credit card. I was transparent about it but did not add her on the card. This seemed to be fine for the short term. 

Not a month later, she asks why I still have it, and whether I was going to cancel it or not (admittedly I had gotten the credit card as part of a promo for some merchandise I bought and used that as a bit of an excuse)? I then in that moment, decide that I’m keeping the credit card and let her know so much, while doing so kindly. I can’t explain to you the amount of frustration she had. It wasn’t an outburst because she’s not that type of person, but I could tell there was a mass of emotion being pent up because she didn’t agree with me keeping it. So then, in response, she immediately asks to be added, and that’s when I respond with a bit less grace that I would not be adding her and that I wanted to have my own credit card. 

This is where things fall off the rails and we did get into quite the argument. I then pour out in far more detail than what I have above, the complete history of financial suffocation that I’ve gone through while compromising on so many financial decisions that were in my opinion significant. So, here we are a few months after, and of course time heals, but every time this credit card is brought up it rekindles a discomfort and tension that is not necessary. 

I have felt that I could never spend my money on what I wanted without being judged or looked at with a critical mindset, and finally, albeit with some clouds in the distance, I have been the most comfortable in my spending in a very long time. I still use the joint account to pay it off so she sees the amounts, but it disturbs her and angers her that she doesn’t know what the expenditures are. I’ve shared most of the generic ones (groceries, gas, road trip to see family, kids, etc.) . But I have spent money on things I know she’s not interested in and have no bearing on the fidelity of our relationship (I’m not out spending money at gentlemen’s clubs, etc.). But at the same time, I know she would not be pleased with them.

Funny enough I’d far rather this dynamic than what I was going through before. I do fear this is starting to wear on the strength of our marriage. In fact, I’m posting this because she just got upset again after asking to see the statements. You can imagine my answer if she stormed off. Some of you might be wondering what the big deal would be, but her financial anxiety does go to a level where she would not accept me spending money on things she doesn’t see value in. I personally feel it’s a shortsighted viewpoint, which is why I’ve taken the approach I have.

Am I wrong in the direction I’ve taken? I guess I feel validated after compromising for so long and giving her what she wanted in financial freedom of owning a house outright, no car payments, zero debt, education saving plans that are maxed out for our children, healthy investments, and an every day checking account that always hovers the $50-60K mark. I do feel like I’ve reached a point of indifference in how she feels and I’m starting to just do what I want money wise. I also don’t think that is healthy, but that is where I am right now and it is somewhat of a place of vulnerability. I personally have always thought that I would have absolute joint transparent financial management with my spouse, but I also assumed I wouldn’t be criticized on expenditures that don’t necessarily align with their values.

TL;DR: I’m in a 17 year relationship with full financial transparency, whether it be bank accounts, credit cards or investments. I have shown a lot of compromise in my financial management style in order to please my spouse, including how we bought our first house. That said, it’s become too much and I decided to register a credit card under my name without her. And I do not share the statements with her and that upsets her greatly. I have assured her there’s nothing she needs to worry about and it’s the least she could do after all I’ve done to enable a financially comfortable situation for our family, without issues. This has put a wedge in our relationship that I fear will exacerbate. But I have felt the most comfortable I have since being single, with my discretionary spending. Is my approach right?

I’d love to hear the spectrum of thoughts on my situation. ",2,1762057212.0,relationships,15,0.6,False

1om8390,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1om8390/why_search_volume_should_be_your_first_stop/,Why Search Volume Should Be Your First Stop Before Building Any SaaS,"Here's something most founders figure out the hard way: you can build the perfect product, but if nobody's looking for it, you're toast.

I've learned that checking search volume first isn't just smart, it's essential. Here's why:

# You're going to need organic traffic eventually

Let's be real. Maybe you'll catch lightning in a bottle and go viral on Twitter or Product Hunt. But that spike? It fades. Fast.

Paid ads burn through cash. Social media posts disappear into the void. Eventually, every SaaS needs that reliable trickle of people finding you through Google, searching at 2am because they're frustrated and need a solution *now*.

So why not start with something people are already searching for? It's like opening a coffee shop on a busy street versus a deserted alley. Same coffee, wildly different foot traffic.

# It's the most honest signal you'll get

Search volume doesn't lie to you. It won't be polite or tell you what you want to hear.

When 2,000 people type ""automate client follow-up emails"" into Google every month, that's not a hypothesis. That's real people, right now, actively hunting for a solution to their problem. They're not just nodding along in a survey or being nice on a discovery call.

If nobody's searching? Maybe the pain isn't painful enough. Maybe it's a ""nice-to-have"" disguised as a ""must-have."" Better to know that before you spend six months building.

# You'll see the battlefield before joining the fight

Keyword difficulty scores give you a reality check. Is your main keyword brutally competitive? Then you already know you need to get creative, niche down, find an angle, target a specific audience.

This isn't discouraging intel. It's strategic. You're essentially scouting the landscape before committing resources. Would you rather discover the competition is fierce *after* launch or *before* writing your first line of code?

# You'll stumble onto competitors you never knew existed

This one surprised me. Start digging into search results, and you'll uncover tools and startups that somehow flew under your radar. Some bootstrapped side project ranking on page one. An established player you'd completely missed.

Suddenly, you're not building in the dark. You can see what's working, what gaps exist, what features users are clearly hungry for based on what they're clicking on. It's like getting a free market research report just by looking at who shows up in the search results.

  


Bottom line? Search volume isn't the *only* thing that matters, but it should be one of your first stops. It's free validation sitting right there in the data, waiting to save you from building something nobody's looking for.",1,1762057192.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False
