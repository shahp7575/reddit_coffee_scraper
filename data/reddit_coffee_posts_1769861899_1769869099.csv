1qs3i5h,https://i.redd.it/zzfcuxdc1pgg1.jpeg,I have the machine and the grinder.. now what?,"I finally unpacked my new coffee instruments (Gaggia Classic E24 and Eureka Mignon Oro single dose) and could use some help or hear other people’s recommendations/ experiences with modifications. 

I ordered a tamping station that I hope will look okay sitting out but if not I’ll store in the cabinet along with everything else. My scale, tamping accessories, puck screens, and latte mugs are coming in on Monday too. 

Is a **mat** to put the grinder and the machine on a good idea? I haven’t gotten a **puck disposal** yet but I would most likely want that out, so I don’t forget to empty it. I like the idea of Normancore one but it’s more of a space saver if I use it to store things vertically on it and that’s one of my limitations. I am already thinking of extra things I can do like buying a **water funnel** for the espresso machine and **changing the dials/hopper of the grinder** for easier use.

I am falling into the black and chrome look that matches the rest of the appliances of the kitchen but don’t want the coffee area to look too out of place in my contemporary home. My husband and I bought this house over the summer and have other pressing remodeling to do before we tackle the ugly tile and outdated electrical plugs. **Any recommendations for cable management?** I like the wood and won’t paint it but I do want to add deep olive green skinny vertical tile as backsplash to the whole kitchen including this area maybe in a year or two. I also am envisioning white or light grey/neutral terrazzo tile for the flooring change. Please ignore the drinking glasses they don’t live there but the bar area is being painted.

This area of my kitchen is dedicated to mugs (top left two cabinets), coffee and tea (all right side cabinets and drawers), and hosting dishes (bottom left drawers and cabinets). I have plenty of space to store things, and I prefer the clean lines without too much stuff on the counter.

Would appreciate your help with any of the topics above. Thanks!",1,1769869044.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1qs3egi,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/1qs3egi/looking_for_a_technical_cofounder_to_build_ai/,Looking for a Technical Co-Founder to Build AI Design Tool [Bangalore/Chennai Preferred],"Hey everyone,

Hunting for a technical co-founder to fix the messy design-to-dev handoff.

**The problem:**

Designers mock in Figma, devs rebuild in code. Slow, inconsistent, every change happens twice. Plus Figma prototypes are fake - can't do real validation or complex interactions.

Tools like v0 and Figma AI are trying to replace designers entirely, which is why companies aren't adopting them. According to Lenny's survey, design is the least AI-penetrated department for exactly this reason - tools that threaten jobs get ignored.

**My approach:**

Help designers do what they already do, but better. Work directly with production frontend code through AI chat. Build component libraries, iterate via conversation, deploy real working UI. Not replacing the designer - augmenting them.

Component-first means consistency by default. And because it's real code, your ""prototype"" IS the product. User testing becomes actually valuable.

**What I bring:**

* 6 YOE as PM, 4 in UX design/research
* Multiple 0-1 products shipped
* Validated with senior designers - they're skeptical of AI but loved this vision
* Built working prototype with Claude(core value prop)
* Deep understanding of the design workflow pain

**What I need:**

Someone technical who can build this properly:

* Strong React skills (component systems, not just basics)
* AI/LLM experience or willingness to learn
* Cares about dev tools
* Preferred: Bangalore/Chennai based (but open to remote if you're the right fit)

**Status:**

Month 1. Working demo exists. Planning 10-week sprint to MVP. Will apply to YC once we have a team + traction.

Not an ideas guy. I'm all in. Need someone equally serious.

Equity will be fairly split. Equally between the core team if we happen to onboard more people.

Specifically how accessible all the combos are and how fast everything comes out. It’s basically get your hit in or get hit, then repeat the longest combo you can string which can last anywhere from 10-20 seconds at a time. 

The guard break build up is so slow, it might as well not even be there. Idk labbing is cool but i feel like half of the playtime i have on this game is repeating the same long ass combo string or getting a long ass combo string done to me. 

Even i wish my opponent got their guard break more often because neutral is the best part of any fighting game and in this game specifically, it feels like neutral is the shortest part of every match. maybe it’s just me complaining and maybe it’s not a common consensus but i really wish that combo breaker took half as long to get to keep things interesting instead of having enough time for a coffee break before i can make an action again.",0,1769868341.0,2XKO,8,0.29,False

1qs35hq,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qs35hq/ot_guys_would_you_please_rate_my_story/,[OT] Guys would you please rate my story,"Several years later, returning home felt like stepping into a life that was no longer theirs. Familiar faces began to look at them as if they were strangers.

I still remember those days when I first left home for engineering studies and stayed in a hostel. Back then, 'home' wasn't just a house made of bricks and mortar; it was a spiritual solace. The six months of the semester in the hostel's four walls somehow passed, but my eyes were always fixed on those red dates on the calendar—summer vacations.

When the train would stop at the station and I'd turn into the alley with my heavy bag slung over my shoulder, it felt like someone had filled my lungs with fresh air. Reaching the doorstep, Amma's scolding—""You're here? You've gotten so thin""—was the biggest reward in the world for me. In those ten to fifteen days, the entire household revolved around me. Even Babuji's reprimands were laced with love, and to my younger siblings, I was nothing short of a hero. I was a part of that home, just like a beating heart in a body.

But then time turned its wheel. I got a job, the city changed, and gradually, visits home became fewer. At first, I'd go for every festival, then just Diwali, and then... only video calls.

Money started coming in. I got the raw roof of the house made permanent. I sent money for Babuji's treatment at a good hospital. I sent new sarees for Amma and a big TV for the house. I thought I was fulfilling my duty. I used to think, ""I'm earning for them, after all."" But I had no idea that in the noise of this 'earning' and 'duty,' the 'sense of belonging' was silently dying somewhere.

Today, after a full five years, I was returning. This time, there was no jostling in the general compartment; I had my own car, branded clothes in my suitcase, and a fat wallet in my pocket. But as I reached the corner of the alley, I felt a strange nervousness.

The old wooden door of the house, where I had once carved my name with a knife, was gone. In its place was a heavy iron gate—strong, shiny, but emotionless. I honked.

Babuji came out. His gait had slowed. He opened the gate, but the old sparkle that used to light up his face when he saw me getting off the train wasn't there. There was a formal smile, like a host welcoming some distinguished guest.

""You're here? The journey was fine, right? Park the car inside,"" he said.

His words had less 'warmth' and more 'courtesy.'

I went inside. The courtyard was now paved. The old tulsi platform where Amma used to light a lamp in the evening had shrunk into a corner.

Amma came out from the kitchen. She didn't hug me; she just ran her hand over my head from a distance. Perhaps my expensive suit and my 'big boss' image was making her hesitant.

In the evening, when we all sat together, an awkward silence spread between us. We used to eat from the same plate before, fighting, making noise. Today, everyone was sitting properly.

My younger brother, who was now a father himself, asked me, ""Bhaiya, would you like tea or should I get coffee made? People in your city must drink coffee, right?""

This question pierced my heart like a dagger. In the home where ginger tea was thrust into my hands without asking my preference, today my 'choice' was being asked. This wasn't respect; it was the distance that time had drawn between us.

The biggest shock came when I headed towards my room.

Amma stopped me hesitantly, ""Beta, that... your room has been turned into a store room. There was too much stuff, you know. I've cleaned the guest room for you. There's an AC there too; you won't feel hot.""

My feet froze right there. My room... where I had woven my nighttime dreams, where I had pasted the poster of my first earning on the wall—that was now a 'store room.' And me? I was no longer the son of this house; I was a guest in the 'guest room.'

That night, lying on the velvety mattress, I couldn't sleep. The coolness of the AC wasn't in my bones, but in the relationships. I realized that I had bought a house in the city, but lost my 'home.' When a person climbs the ladder of success, often the very ladder they stepped on to climb up gets left behind.

I was the same, the house was the same, the people were the same. Just, time had erected an invisible wall between us. I understood that now I was just a 'relative' who comes only on vacations, someone whose arrival is awaited, but over whom no one claims any rights anymore.

That night, under the roof of my own home, I felt homeless.",1,1769868159.0,shortstories,0,1.0,False

AITAH","so,,aitah?, I 40m have been in a situationship with the love of my life 43f for a about 6yrs now. she is the one. The one. I could never love or want to love another woman the same as I do her. I honestly believe that a women in life has a void deep down that grows inside and a compelling desire to fill this void, most woman do I think from speaking with them anyways,  this void is natures trick from evolution to make them biologically want children and thus keep the survival of our species.i honestly think straight men(possibly gay men 2 without knowing) have this same void in them but for the love of a  women. maybe , I think. I feel the only woman to ever satisfy this hole i have had in me for so long is this one woman.all prevoius contenders maybe gave it an itch ,at most.that felt fine too as I didnt know any better [then.it](http://then.it) never felt complete, but ""good enough"" until properly occupied by my queen. no matter what ever happens to us, or life in general I would proudly die to protect her if needs be, is this also a biological pre programming in some men? another evolutionary  trick possibly to ensure woman's safety as they are more valuable as far as reproduction goes? remember.. men are less valuable because we are programmed to spread our limitless seeds to ensure survival of our personal dna and of course the species.1 man dies no problem people just replace him and his sperm with that of another. we did not care so much at a time in history about the life quality of our offspring but more so about quantity and variety. we are disposable.and this still stands today no matter how we like to argue. we are valuable as individuals of course but from evolutions pov, not the case at all. so. to know the place nature gave u as a man and life will be more rewarding i have found when we find peace with this mild natural ego bash.. reproductions speaking of course, in real life we are no more or less important. back to the juice of my story I need help or at least some general opinions.

our situationship has been open since the start, i was transparent of never commiting to a woman sexualy ever again but will have some moral decor and show of respect in the meantime and use this power not to overindulge in it, but appreciate its presence to once again be back where nature has always intended it to be, Now, i have used this refound power of freedom  in a mature , non ""macho"" way as carefully as possible as to not hurt my queens feelings while also expressing to her I am excerising my freedom as explained . not to prove a point to her, but that point proving was a bonus in an understanding pov of US that I had no pleasure in exposing to her but at my fine age of 35 or 36 I felt no reason to lie.She did not retaliate or even ask me to never do again, but I could see the disappointment in her. Its a horrible feeling I had endured previously as I was abused by power of sex in my marriage . no way out, a home, a marriage certificate to prove i had committed and 2 beautiful girls depending on me to provide, protect and raise them in the slightly more rough and tumble way of men that is I believe a must. most mother's would disagree, and that is out of fear, and correcting my fatherly skills with all other women on board ready to point. mother's think what's best from them is best from the dad. I see so many depressed dad's give up parenting to some level only to be told or yelled at for no longer spending quality time with the child, and lets face it men we all know why. a man playing and raising his kids the way the woman has pushed for is neither quality time for the child but also for him while belittling his natural course of father child bonding. we can be amazingly accurate at things like speed balance and punctuality in range of movements we never knew we had when there is our own offsprings fate in our hands 🤣 so its understandable the fear of the mothers at times but that fear only means lack of trust with best of intentions. now I too had fear, fear  of too much mothering and then they grow with a ""everyone gets a medal"" type outlook on life. ..we all know where that leads. so its a balance of the 2 IMHO, a perfect balance.

I am going through the divorce currently with this ex and have remained friends with her,  more so for the children and ..even after her abuse of power over me with sex (my own fault for letting it happen) my ex is a good woman at her core , so this friendship we share is her way of children coming first, my way for them is this also, so  go us as coparents.  no courts or fighting.we share 2 beautiful daughters, 7 and 11.Now before I indulge in talk of my fellow situationship lady, who had her reproduction plans also executed and finished before we met and she has her divorce finalised and done around the time we met.

Basicaly we were friends for a year first,  before real physical contact. so this really helped us get an unbiased yet truthful understanding of each other not yet knowing we would end up together,our chemistry and connection was off the wall at levels i never knew existed (we both admittedly did hope to share life with one another) and I guess coming from a marriage of a near decade and being manipulated and schemed with regarding our sex life, there was a passing of time after having piecing the small mistakes together and inconsistency of truth or actions ,deniying it to myself because she couldnt possibly use sex as an unknown bargaining tool and weapon  against me, could she...nah, she loves me too much.  ATTENTION MEN ATTENTION!!!

WAKE UP- some MEN reading this and SMELL the coffee. If u feel something is off either communicate or observe how it might manifest if it does so at all. trust me, it will save u time, money and a pain in your heart when u discover the same sad truth...she was never in love with me,  she did and I know still does to a degree love me,but as for IN love???, nope, she was just IN love with what i could provide.(possible evolutionary trick no3 ???🤣).

A sexual revelation of the own mind because of a long lost and now rekindled sexual freedom is, for the most part best described as a likening to a  rebirth of one's own existence, i think for men mostly  but i can imagine for alot of woman too, although perhaps not as deeply connected to .

sense of who they are and a natural craving for variety i might we gotta  suggest. -not claim.

I had a sense of a new born freedom attached with manhood and freedom of choice after we split that i was never going to give away so foolishly again. or at all for that matter , (i think she taught id eventually crawl back after moving in to my mother's house and stay there with her a few weeks and i still sectetly like that she never got to live out that satisfaction) this freedom i mention, sexual freedom,and the holy grail of if the kids are not with me for this half of the week or this night and thst, I GET TO DO WHAT I WANT, GO WHERE I WANT AND SIGNIFICANTLY enough..  whomever i want there and then. well that's if they mutualy feel the same and agree to lol i swear 🙋‍♂️ im not a rapist 😅

What a rush that it was that I felt like i was me again.my deepest inner part of my sexuality had given me a kick in head to go and do. just do , do because it was a feeling i oppressed, that feeling of variety and vowed to never do again with another woman . getting married and foolishly putting my power in to the hands of a another human who did not have the best of plans with it or at best wake it up for reward the husband dury time.. i like to think she didnt plan it so harsh, and with my hand held up high i hope there was wrong doings of a significance in meaning that applied to her by myself that helped push this horrible fate for a man.nothing that stands to mind but little arguements and bickering possibly built up and not all women, but a large portion just cant let something go.they will act fine but inside that vindictive mind she had more fantasies about getting me back than the number of fantasies a Pee Dooo File at his weekend job , dressed in a Barney the Dino suit at a kids birthday party🤣 .

so many men suffer in silence , we men can only fully know what it means and what that preprgramming of an  itch inside our cores wants us to do-- more adventurous sex and a varietiable number of partners is also nice, but not a real need when replaced with love.  and that alone can, maybe aid in helping us keep it at bay. but, if the woman we love and committed our life and sexual freedom to takes it to advantage her position higher position in the home,rather than using it with her partner to the advantage of the relationship, then that kindness of our very self valuable giving or offering up of, as an exchange representing  a show or display of love and resect, this preprgrammed itch that never lay fully  dormant but also never to be spoken about or acknowledged upon...like an unnecessary evil or dysfunction in 1 gender thats needs squashing ,  even to suggest that it is there, for some men,  to merely express in some few words of desperate recognition that its a  part of us... that is enough to start the crazy parade in some wives, whom would be better off understanding this piece of him and working  this male traitto the better. after all he had the power all along till he committed. A thank you to her for acknowledging she chose him for life, or in some cases..   the unknowing simp she caught  and

\~(,this primal drive is stronger in some men i would imagine but within us all, only some wont admit this in shame and especially the most faithfully married good men will not for fear of disappointing the SO , we have all seen these tamed pets, the jerk a knee when asked and a quick need to  profess how the rest of men are mere animals, but not him because he is different- all the  while we can observe that she knows damn well he is the same,  so.   the more he lies to please and convince her, ironically the more she gains in power innocently listening behind that half side smirk on her face ) \~

as bad as things ever got in my sad personal oppression,  i never swayed ,not much then anyways for the worst i ever did out of my wedlock or cocklock i should say was manage to follow through with was a kiss with a stranger at a bar , as a petty resentment fueled personal ""get back at  her"" type  way and feeling like a man in control of my choices again.it was a symbolic moment for me to push back as i realised i can be still desirable to somebody at the least.

now there had been occasional times that had passed throughout our marriage where women would suggest with subtle cues ,so subtle that i have even seen many  men whom half askeep to the female body language miss completely and miss out. these cues are not just for flirting but also a quick test to a mans social awareness. But how often do most average guys get hit on by a woman, i think very little so it never even clicked with them that this may be the case in the unkown shot to thier egotistic awakening of self worth and value in the game.

never had that problem myself, not to gloat. im average in looks, thats humble im actually a little higher in looks than average. but thats only an initiator with women. And my height..  doesnt even contribute at a mere 5,6ft  or at most a  possible 5,7 getting up in the morning also does not effect me negatively either.  and if ut has done, how would i ever find out..

. aaaaah.      ignorance can be bliss.

I find confidence but not too cocky,  and no lies or bull shit 1 liners work way better than the crap thrown at women in desperate pick me im a simp attention. Trust me, sooner or later in the conversation they will ask in different ways or words the same question after sizing ur character and general self reflection of who u are, in more or less straight up full judgmental staring of u - where do u see this going?  or - how come ur still here talking with me and not over there with all your friends?

the majority of guys who get that far may, or will feel weak with a fight to find the perfect answer.  they fear she is calling him on his BS. and then backtrack to the non predator universal safe to use vibe of   "" im one of the good guys"" or im safe or bla bla bla. The majority of women i have noticed ,  and do still notice are good at heart. they entertain a while longer while not to hurt his ego even though they know hes not even on the bottom of the list , I presume that they have possible brothers equally as shy or male friends whom are blind to the unwritten rules of the game. The body language slowly adjusts from an opening of possible invite to a closed off type of nice to meet u and take care , goodbye vibe.

So what has worked for me, I told u already \~ brutal honesty. I have gauged from the general vibrations between us, or the context of words used or how dirty is dirty and can it be applied here.. to the batting of eyelids and the twirling of the straw as she plays with it on her lips. And that slight micro second of a faint squint so sublte but so full of meaning.  This is the invitation to express u caught it, by throwing it back with the slightest of a smirk. If she she is interested she will smirk back , in some cases I have the small smirk break in to a full unwanted smile. NOW..  HAHA I GOT HER.

lean in and not to quietly,  or too loud clearly speak in to 1 side of her face, not the ear, its space consuming and might tickle. .\~ I want to make u cum, with whatever and how ever until its my turn to share in 1 with u. how many do u want ???

pull slowly back and lock her eyes. be ready to protect your face from a slap if u have been. drinking heavily,  it doesn't hit home like u taught it did.

but it has worked alot. they women who are willing to engage in an ONS will hear that like music to thier ears.

Ahem.. cough jesus sorry lads got carried away. so.. where was , ya the lady in my life, my Queen. Jaysus shes so fkn cool. I might have lost her. I dont know.

we have progressively grown closer and closer and I know if soul mating is a thing. then she is mine. that does not always ensure a happy ending for u together,  but its a nice boost in that direction.

she is amazing, in bed , in her mind and has that ooze type appeal of femininity.  matches my masculinity to a tea. now she has her masculine moments,  few and small that oddly enough... knowing its like a loss to her own self and her character,  she slowly,  while in our arguements starts to realise shes not being her. and iv never said this to her because it may on a conscious level stop her from doing this.. but I think she looks so fkn hot. all red , from rushed blood to the cheeks in a heated debate... and then even more so as the next rush of blood is an extra hit of cheek coloring from a little embarrassment of losing touch. God I love this woman.

rarley she has experienced me in my feminine,  I feel stupid at times when it emerges. the worst the other day happened. iv been sick to my core  for a few months now, the ultimatum. she can not keep going on without my commitment. FUCK.

And she means business. I admire her for that.  it has a weird hypocritical added attraction to her. she knows what she wants. and she is going to get it,  or walk away.

its been the elephant in the room now for the past 3 or 4 months. she had made hints at commitment leading u to that day back in last November,  I splattered out in retribution the exact words of

\~ I am not committed to u sexualy. I never agreed to it. And I said im willing to compromise so do with that what u want.

we kept driving and held hands tightly. I knew then that this holding of hands so tightly  was our mutual communication of pleading the other to agree to what they are opposing.

And I have been a bag of nerves since. I trust her, not that she would never hurt me with rejections because let's face it,  they are part of how it works. And I have had to reject her at times also. and ahe gets it. only I have seen her defensively react with a sharp tone declining my advances. Does she mean to be so sharp to hurt my feeling and ego? I believe not, I dont know how hard in her form relationship or previous ones to get that simple no across. so i use my logins..  and do not take it personally. But the fragile man inside, who has been here before feels threatened.  and even had snapped back in a bark of words.    \~ you dont have to be so mean in the way u reject me. iv got feelings or something worded like ..  \~ I could never reject u with that level of harshness !!!!

Then sulk like a moody 5 yr old who dropped his fucking ice cream in the sand.

I know she doesn't mean it, but I still feel it sometimes depending on the tone. And it scares me even more from committing. im stuck. we have had an extra amount of bickering,we have momentarily hurt the other with words. The worst words came from me in thebgeat of it while out at a play one night and enjoying a few pints of beer. she always forgives so openly when things die down. because she loves me. or maybe just maybe that bad version of me I had displayed was like a tame choir boy version of what She has put up with from other men.

but god j love her and we both knew the time is coming, without speaking on it since that last time. It had effects on my mood. my energy and general well being. I finished work the other day, and went the few doors down to her work place, thank god it was lashing rain. and dark. the passing of cars full of known local people were completely oblivious to the stream of tears coming down my face. it had caught up with me. the built up pressure of what will possibly be our outcome had tormented me to a point I needed it to end. I felt sick, but I knew i has to end it now. I balled my tears out and got to the door. saturated, and like a chameleon blending in with the rain my tears invisible,  even to myself except for that not too familiar taste,  of salt. I was lost in my mind. I howled like a dog and circled up and down by her door with clenched fists of frustration that she had already closed up and left. I circled again and again and with each passing turning the door I glanced up at that door with the blurriest vision of my life,  hoping it wasn't real. and every turn that proved the worst existence of reality I frankly got more and more desperate to be next to her. my plan yo break up had stung me so damn hard in my gut, heart and head. the very person I came to finish with was the very person I yearned for to comfort me. lost.

just god damn lost. iv not felt this level of loss,  sadness or the fight against fainting or at the very least, my buckling knees failing to support. I considered getting on my knees for energy. that would of been a sight for nosey neighbours passing by.

I went back down the road, running , bawling, howling and retreated quickly to my car. bot to stay dry, I was saturated to the bone already. but fear of being spotted.

this,  I believe is not much if any of the biological making up of man hood. Just like my full fledged meaning of manhood in my sexuality,  although the latter is biological but exaggerated to the extreme by societal norms.

I made it , im in my car, she didn't see me at my worst.

I pulled myself together in what I believed to be a minute, but probably double or more. and as I got ready to exit and go over to  close my business I went to check my eyes for any clues of there ever being any crying on my face.  I glanced up , cheeks all puffy, eyes bloodshot like I had smoked 5 strong joints in a row, and when I saw the state of my after effects of sadness, I burst out again. oh god not again I taught. its been 22 years since I cried properly,  over the loss of my best friend. My dad. My father.

I stayed there for I dont know how long. 2 or 15 minutes I really don't know. the passing of time seemed slow. and I was in pure , genuine pain of my heart breaking. And with that I got a fright, the passenger door whipped open and jumped back from my hunched over position on the the steering wheel that had held my head up for me, and as I tried wiping my face clear of the evidence there she stood  .

a look of horror in her facial expression.

what are u doing she pushed out with a fast exhale of disbelief.

And I started apologising profusely for crying infront of her, and started back in to the never ending burst of full on shit show crying agai. she sat with me till I calmed . we didnt talk much. I was late already to get my girls from my exes house. it was so embarrassing

, I guess maybe the only good from that mistaken encounter in my car was she now knows how strongly she impacted my life.

the next day I felt better. the sadness still consumed me but level off next to an new found acceptance of reality.

we agreed that she will not move from her position of nob conpromisable.

I agreed to to meet her half way, but no less out of my self respect. and not 1 percent more than 50 out of respect for her.

we will see lots of each other around,  as friends. And she did text me this morning asking if the day comes that I do decide to change my mind, will I come get her asap.  I told her I dont see that day coming,  and if we mean the same as we do to each other.  I think a 50 50 is the only way to go.

I am gutted. do u guys think its my ego, or fear, or stubbornness or mixture of 2, tainted with a dash of the last ingredient.  has anybody been here before? and no , its not marriage,  and there is no house or kids. its a verbal agreement that we would agree on, that can only happen on her terms. im not sure, my logics say if she cant agree on a 50 50 partnership to get going and up in the air, is this a clue she won't be 50 50 in other areas. or is it just this 1, for an imaginary certificate that expresses my love , or amount of love by choosing her over the part of me I swore to keep forever. not sure id use much or if ever , experiments maybe, or rare exemptions I don't know. all I know is its mine, and I dont want to part from it. and she beautiful guys, u would scratch ur heads and wonder what is wrong with me. and she even though she is that beautiful,  its the beauty within that I see. the beauty deep down under the layers I carefully peeled away over time as she exposed the woman inside to me.

Im tearing up again ffs. I will go now. I dont need advice but maybe some alternative opinions or ideas. .

and men, maybe we cant have our cake and eat it too, but goddammit we gotta try. shoot for the moon, u will miss but ul land high up there somewhere

wish me luck

and take it easy on me if it turns out im a dick for this, im suffering enough as is..

1qs32gw,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1qs32gw/would_you_guys_please_rate_my_story/,Would you guys please rate my story,"Several years later, returning home felt like stepping into a life that was no longer theirs. Familiar faces began to look at them as if they were strangers.

I still remember those days when I first left home for engineering studies and stayed in a hostel. Back then, 'home' wasn't just a house made of bricks and mortar; it was a spiritual solace. The six months of the semester in the hostel's four walls somehow passed, but my eyes were always fixed on those red dates on the calendar—summer vacations.

When the train would stop at the station and I'd turn into the alley with my heavy bag slung over my shoulder, it felt like someone had filled my lungs with fresh air. Reaching the doorstep, Amma's scolding—""You're here? You've gotten so thin""—was the biggest reward in the world for me. In those ten to fifteen days, the entire household revolved around me. Even Babuji's reprimands were laced with love, and to my younger siblings, I was nothing short of a hero. I was a part of that home, just like a beating heart in a body.

But then time turned its wheel. I got a job, the city changed, and gradually, visits home became fewer. At first, I'd go for every festival, then just Diwali, and then... only video calls.

Money started coming in. I got the raw roof of the house made permanent. I sent money for Babuji's treatment at a good hospital. I sent new sarees for Amma and a big TV for the house. I thought I was fulfilling my duty. I used to think, ""I'm earning for them, after all."" But I had no idea that in the noise of this 'earning' and 'duty,' the 'sense of belonging' was silently dying somewhere.

Today, after a full five years, I was returning. This time, there was no jostling in the general compartment; I had my own car, branded clothes in my suitcase, and a fat wallet in my pocket. But as I reached the corner of the alley, I felt a strange nervousness.

The old wooden door of the house, where I had once carved my name with a knife, was gone. In its place was a heavy iron gate—strong, shiny, but emotionless. I honked.

Babuji came out. His gait had slowed. He opened the gate, but the old sparkle that used to light up his face when he saw me getting off the train wasn't there. There was a formal smile, like a host welcoming some distinguished guest.

""You're here? The journey was fine, right? Park the car inside,"" he said.

His words had less 'warmth' and more 'courtesy.'

I went inside. The courtyard was now paved. The old tulsi platform where Amma used to light a lamp in the evening had shrunk into a corner.

Amma came out from the kitchen. She didn't hug me; she just ran her hand over my head from a distance. Perhaps my expensive suit and my 'big boss' image was making her hesitant.

In the evening, when we all sat together, an awkward silence spread between us. We used to eat from the same plate before, fighting, making noise. Today, everyone was sitting properly.

My younger brother, who was now a father himself, asked me, ""Bhaiya, would you like tea or should I get coffee made? People in your city must drink coffee, right?""

This question pierced my heart like a dagger. In the home where ginger tea was thrust into my hands without asking my preference, today my 'choice' was being asked. This wasn't respect; it was the distance that time had drawn between us.

The biggest shock came when I headed towards my room.

Amma stopped me hesitantly, ""Beta, that... your room has been turned into a store room. There was too much stuff, you know. I've cleaned the guest room for you. There's an AC there too; you won't feel hot.""

My feet froze right there. My room... where I had woven my nighttime dreams, where I had pasted the poster of my first earning on the wall—that was now a 'store room.' And me? I was no longer the son of this house; I was a guest in the 'guest room.'

That night, lying on the velvety mattress, I couldn't sleep. The coolness of the AC wasn't in my bones, but in the relationships. I realized that I had bought a house in the city, but lost my 'home.' When a person climbs the ladder of success, often the very ladder they stepped on to climb up gets left behind.

I was the same, the house was the same, the people were the same. Just, time had erected an invisible wall between us. I understood that now I was just a 'relative' who comes only on vacations, someone whose arrival is awaited, but over whom no one claims any rights anymore.

1qs2wp8,https://v.redd.it/x16za2u6vogg1,The Demo for spiritpunk deckbuilding brawler CROWNBREAKERS is OUT!,"I'm excited to announce that the [demo for my deck-building brawler / turn-based tactics game CROWNBREAKERS](https://sharkbombs.itch.io/crownbreakers) has just been released on itch.io!

You can also [find (and wishlist) the game on Steam here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2938540/Crownbreakers/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=demo).

Crownbreakers is a game born out of my passion for games like Magic: The Gathering and interesting worldbuilding!

# THE GAME

**Crownbreakers** is a fast-paced card game of revolutionary violence that combines turn-based tactics with deck-building mechanics in one snappy package. Fight against necromantic criminals and demonic billionaires for the people of Cascade.

To succeed you need to use your champion's actions and your cards together to control the battlefield. Push enemies into the perfect position for your area of effect abilities or chain explosive barrels together to pulverize the opposition. Master this to make the most of your abilities.

Each turn the battlefield advances, uncovering new obstacles, new enemies but also new rewards: rare cards for your deck, powerful relics to enable new synergies, and stickers to add to your cards. Build your deck and keep pushing forward. Only the strong can make it to the boss.

Luckily you can add Stickers to create powerful, custom cards. With stickers you can increase a card's damage, add new abilities or even extend a card's area of effect. Limits are for other people. And the right sticker on the right card can make or break a run.

And no matter the outcome, you can return to the city to power up. Complete quests and share the loot from your battles with the people of the city. Unlock new powers and get to know its colorful characters. Before your return for another run against the city's tyrants.

# THE WORLD

**Crownbreakers** is set in a spiritpunk world ruled by tyrants that grow fat by stealing souls just to grind them into profit. But you're done playing their game. You are fighting to break the soul trade and to free Cascade, your city.

Step into a world where modern technology and magic coexist. People commute to work and buy their drinks at the franchise coffee shop on the corner while spirits bring technology alive and floating islands drift on invisible currents across the sky.

The truly dedicated can strengthen their soul and learn ways of using this magic to master mighty supernatural abilities. Unfortunately the rich and powerful know how to buy, steal or crush both magic and souls. All so they can hyper-charge their stranglehold on the world.

As said, the Crownbreakers Demo is now out on itch.io. You can download it for free here: [https://sharkbombs.itch.io/crownbreakers](https://sharkbombs.itch.io/crownbreakers). And if any of the above sounded interesting, give it a go! I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback!

1qs2vo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CheatedOn/comments/1qs2vo0/i_got_a_visa_he_got_side_quests/,I got a Visa. He got side quests,"In 2018, I was in college in France, as I am a native of Paris. I got the opportunity to go to Ireland for one year for an Erasmus. Absolutely thrilled and single at the time, I just wanted to study there and get a chance to discover a new country.

Here comes September 2018. I move to Cork, Ireland, with two other flatmates. On my second night in the city, I decide to go out with my flatmate and discover the nightlife. Absolutely great — live music, great banter.

After one week living in Cork, I meet one of my classmates, with whom I go out. We have a few laughs and pints in a pub where there is live music, and we dance. Until a horde of 20 males waltzes into the pub, full of testosterone. We dance with a few of them, just for fun. Then one lad goes up on stage, belligerently drunk, takes the guitar, and sings. His shirt is half undone, and he is sweating like crazy, but the spotlight shines on him like Edward’s infamous scene in Twilight.

Long story short, we start chatting that night and hit it off straight away. The next day, he messages me asking me out for a coffee. I cannot tell you how giddy I was — I was absolutely buzzing to meet up with him.

We start dating, and everything is absolutely great. One thing I didn’t mention yet: he is a professional footballer and a musician. So he only lived with boys, and it seemed like a frat sometimes at his place.

After a few months of dating, Covid happened, and I couldn’t come home anymore as France had shut down the borders. He asked me if I wanted to do lockdown with him in another city — I accepted. His parents literally lived in the house in front of him, so I got to spend my whole lockdown with an overprotective mother (you know how it can be). One lockdown finishes, I come back home for a while and worked outside of my studies.

We started a long-distance relationship because we considered our relationship strong enough to survive living abroad. For two and a half years, we do long distance. But every single time, I did my best to come see him in Ireland for a few weeks. In two years, he never came to see me in Paris. I was the only one coming to see him, and I was the only one paying for flights every single time…

After finishing college, we had a long discussion. We decided to move in together, but we had to figure out where. At that time, he lived in Northern Ireland, so the UK. We decided that I was going to join him there. I had to start everything from scratch, find a job, and apply for a visa because of Brexit. I spent 25K on the bloody visa — all of my savings went into that piece of paper.

We found an amazing place right in the city. I had an amazing job that I was really passionate about and got my car. I settled in perfectly. I moved overseas for him, but I could not regret my choice.

After a year, I was more and more alone at home — even though he worked at 6 p.m. He was home more than I was, but regardless, on my only day off, I did all the grocery shopping, cleaning, and cooking. Every single time we had dinner, once he finished, he left the table without putting away his dirty dishes or washing them. He never paid for groceries either. He was just uninvolved. Our arguments about this started being more frequent, but can you blame me? I worked a double job (one remote and one there), from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., had one day off, and had to deal with all that from a man-child who was nearly 30.

Anyway, one day, I come home late from work. He is there in the kitchen with a cuppa, waiting for me. We start chatting, and he tells me that the relationship isn’t working for him anymore. I can completely understand — love changes, especially after six years. I only asked him if he met someone else; he said no.

That night, we sleep in different rooms. I know him by heart, and I could feel something was off. I have never snooped in his phone, but I decided to check. He had an old phone that I managed to charge and get working, and I went on his Instagram.

Turns out, he met someone. A 40-year-old married woman with two kids. My heart sank. But the worst part was that, as I was on his Instagram, I could see them chatting live. I’ll spare you the texts, but I just discovered that not only was he having an affair with her, but they did their extracurricular activities in my house, my bed, and in my own car — not his — mine.

I found myself in a dark void, scrolling through his whole Instagram. Turns out, along the way, he found 15 other women. For more than four years, he was cheating, and I never knew anything about it.

That night, I booked a one-way ticket back home. The next day, I packed my suitcases and told work I was leaving the following day.

I was going to leave, but not before I confronted him. So first and foremost, I know he loves his tea. So I opened and destroyed every single teabag in the house — I know it’s petty, but it was so satisfying.

There he comes, acting innocent. I ask five times, “Is there someone else?” He says no. I show his phone and ask again, “Is there someone else?” He says no. I unlock his phone and go on Instagram’s homepage and ask again, “Is there someone else?” He says no.

It is fair to say I completely blacked out and entered a stage of rage I didn’t know existed. I made him read out loud every single message. He still denied it.

The only emotion he had towards me was “crap, I got caught,” which made me spiral. No empathy, no sorry, nothing. I eventually calmed down and asked if his family knew it was over between us. Because what I didn’t say before was that his parents stayed with us for a few days, and instead of being with them, he was with that married woman. He told them it was over, but omitted the cheating. As my ego took a toll, I gave him an ultimatum: either he tells the truth to his mom, or I send her the receipts — all the dirty texts. Safe to say he preferred to be the one to tell the truth to her.

FYI : his parents are ultra conservative Christians. So they do not condone one bit this attitude. Which makes ma laugh even more today

The next day, I left for good, without telling him. I had to start my whole life again after being away for more than two years.

1qs2vby,https://www.reddit.com/r/Angular2/comments/1qs2vby/plugin_framework_available/,Plugin framework available,"Hey, let me introduce you to [ng-xtend](https://ng-xtend.dev), the open-source plugin framework for Angular!

Notice how Wordpress, Nextcloud or Drupal are successful thanks to their ecosystem of plugins?
Notice how easy it is to develop, discover and install them?

*Wouldn't it be great to have the same extensibility for Angular apps?*

That's what **ng-xtend** is for !

With it, your application can
- Statically or dynamically loads plugins
- Assign a plugin to display, edit or act on a particular data type
- Have all plugins work together in a page, a list, a form or for data persistence

Today with release 0.6, with a simple json file like this:

```
{
  ""type"": ""Application"",
  ""name"": ""Coffee Bean Evaluator"",
  ""entities"": {
    ""a"": {
      ""name"": ""Coffee Evaluation"",
      ""fields"": {
        ""e"": {
          ""name"": ""Name"",
          ""type"": ""Text""
        },
        ""b"": {
          ""name"": ""Picture"",
          ""type"": ""Image""
        },
        ""c"": {
          ""name"": ""Comment"",
          ""type"": ""Text""
        },
        ""d"": {
          ""name"": ""Note"",
          ""type"": ""Rating""
        },
        ""a"": {
          ""name"": ""Maxicoffee"",
          ""type"": ""Price""
        }
      }
    }
}
```

Other examples here:[Demo Repository](https://dont-code.net/apps/repo/default)

You can check [ng-xtend-examples repo](https://github.com/dont-code/ng-xtend-examples) to learn how to use [ng-xtend](https://github.com/dont-code/ng-xtend).

Developing a new plugin is basically just wrapping existing angular components into a lightweight framework, you can check here for an example.

The framework is growing in several directions:
- Obviously enhance the UI/UX of the default plugin. It works but would really need to be more user friendly.
- Extend support of any kind of datamodels, like ""list of sub elements"" or ""many-to-one"", ""many-to-many relationship""
- Look at how a non-IT user could leverage AI and LLM to generate their application. As it just needs a json file, it should be feasible
- Have more and more plugins by making them easy to develop and to consume
- Add support for advanced workflows, in addition to the master-detail provided.",1,1769867445.0,Angular2,0,0.67,False

Picture this.  
The office is open. Lights are on. Slack is busy. Revenue dashboard is moving.  
No humans are actually working.

Here is how the company runs.

Content  
ChatGPT is writing blogs at 2 am explaining thought leadership it does not believe in. Humans approve it without reading.

SEO  
Gemini is fixing meta titles and internal links while quietly judging our keyword strategy.

Research  
Perplexity is pulling sources in seconds while the founder says I remember reading something like this somewhere.

Coding  
Claude is refactoring code written by a developer who now manages prompts instead of logic. Copilot nods politely and auto completes everything.

Ads  
Meta AI is running campaigns optimizing ROAS while humans argue about creatives that performed well in 2019.

Email marketing  
Klaviyo AI is sending flows based on behavior data while someone says let us just blast one more newsletter.

Sales  
HubSpot AI is scoring leads and drafting follow ups. The sales rep says I will reply after lunch.

Branding  
Midjourney and DALL E are creating visuals while the brand manager says this feels off but cannot explain why.

HR  
An AI recruiter is shortlisting candidates. A human still asks where do you see yourself in five years.

Accounting  
AI bookkeeping reconciles transactions perfectly. The founder still checks the bank balance daily for emotional support.

Finance  
Forecasting AI models cash flow scenarios. Humans say growth will fix it.

Shopping  
Agentic AI is negotiating prices and reordering inventory. Someone adds a standing desk to cart by mistake.

Customer support  
AI resolves tickets in seconds. A human steps in only to say sorry for the inconvenience.

Meanwhile the humans  
Drinking coffee  
Refreshing dashboards  
Debating tools  
Procrastinating  
Saying we should really understand this AI stuff better

At this point the real Org chart looks like this.  
AI runs the company.  
Humans are the vibe check.

I was rushing through downtown during peak lunch hour – you know, that blur of suits, coffee cups, and the constant hum of city noise. Suddenly, a man ahead of me, probably in his late 50s or early 60s, just… crumpled. Not a trip, not a stumble, but a complete, almost slow-motion collapse right there on the sidewalk.

My heart did a little jump, and I instinctively took a step forward. But then, something bizarre happened. The river of people just kept flowing. Seriously, a guy was lying motionless on the pavement, and people were literally stepping *around* him. Some glanced, their eyes darting away almost immediately as if they'd seen something they shouldn't. Others just stared straight ahead, a determined indifference etched on their faces. The bustling street, usually so full of loud conversations, felt eerily silent around this man.

I felt this weird internal tug-of-war. My first instinct was to help, but then this tiny, insidious voice whispered, 'Someone else will. Look at all these people.' I saw others hesitating, just like me, caught in that agonizing moment of indecision. The seconds stretched into an eternity, filled with the terrifying realization that *no one* was moving. It was like we were all waiting for permission, for someone else to break the spell.

Finally, a young couple, pushing through the crowd with wide, concerned eyes, broke free and rushed to his side. They were asking if he was okay, gently trying to help him sit up. The spell was broken. Suddenly, a few other people started to slow down, some even muttering apologies as if *they* had been caught doing something wrong. But for that agonizing minute, it was just the man and a street full of frozen statues.

It really hit me hard how powerful that 'bystander effect' is. It’s not that people are inherently cruel; it’s like our brains just short-circuit in a crowd, expecting someone else to take the lead.

""AI's don't fucking know how to read minds ( yet )""
Why do I lead with that? Well, being someone who writes software and sees great potential for AI to aid in individual bug-squashing or code reviews, or command line shortcuts... If you blindly tell ANY AI something like, ""Write a blog for me. And make it 1337 n swaggy and amazing and make it brew my coffee!!1!one1!!""?
You ARE the biggest part of the problem.
I don't say this to hate on AI, I say this for the same reason I wouldn't send a single lone email to a HUMAN and expect anything other than vague, generic garbage with hidden bugs in it.
Think of it like this, imagine you're hired at a warehouse. You're handed a uniform, given sit-down classes for a little bit, and are then clocked in and told, vaguely, to, ""Start working. Carry some boxes or something?""
You'd have no fucking idea what you were really doing, where to go to grab boxes, where to put them, or which ones go where or why.
AI, is objectively an incredibly helpful tool, IF. And ONLY if, you give it context ( why are we doing this? What's the goal? Where will it run? How fast must it run? Blue background or dark theme? Etc... ) because it can be the smartest entity on the planet, it still can't predict the nightmarishly tangled mess that is the human brain from a 2 message exchange.
Some examples of bad prompting:
""Build me a website that ranks cats by furriness.""
No hints on style, theme, layout, which languages and frameworks to use, what kind of server it'll run on, how it's even supposed to rank cats at all, etc...
""Draw a cute cat""
No artistic direction, no thematic hints, no background mentioned, and THE INTERNET IS ALREADY FULL OF CATS!!!
""I'm gonna just copy paste this entire ebook blindly into the first text to speech AI I can find, and I'm 110,000,000% sure it'll come out great!""
Ow. YouTube is dying because of this kind of behavior. And nobody ever seems to listen to the whole thing before posting. That's how to get channels about psychology who can't pronounce half of the words correctly, or even consistently.
Good Prompts:
""I just wrote a new page on my website. I'm going to ask this bot to do a code review with me, so I can fix errors quickly""
This is arguably one of the best uses of LLMs in coding. They are anal. They are quick readers. And they can think about the entire code base at once without being overwhelmed.
""I just finished a ticket on my project. I'm going to have the bot check the ticket versus the code versus some screenshots and see if I missed anything.""
Same reason as last prompt. Specific, targeted. Definite goal, and enough info for a skilled human to work with.
""I forgot how to use this obscure function or CLI tool. I'll ask the AI how to accomplish a specific task, and what the command would look like.""
These programs are legendary at indexing and formatting. They are encyclopedias that can talk. Almost, if not all, of them basically swallowed Wikipedia whole. Along with so much code and documentation, even a Microsoft engineer would crap themselves just looking at the volume.
""I want to deep-dive into a topic I'm unfamiliar with. The Wikipedia article is a bit dense and complicated. I'll have the bot split it into smaller, easier to digest chapters or sections, in simpler words.""
This is one of AI's grandest shining points. Learning on your own, without a multi million dollar college degree or a molten brain. These things have near-infinite patience, and they don't mind explaining it 20 different ways to explain why an engine needs gasoline to work.
I'm gonna leave off here, but TL;DR, ask it to perform a task. A single, understandable, task. Don't expect it to have the slightest clue what you want or need. Don't use it to be lazy. Use it as it was intended. To boost, not replace, you.

Your distinction between using AI as a Lazy Replacement versus a Specific Booster (like the 'Anal Code Reviewer') is high-value because it shifts the burden of clarity back to the human—where it belongs.

The rant delivers a sharp, no-nonsense breakdown of why ""vibe coding"" polarizes the field: it unlocks absurd speed for throwaway experiments and learning when wielded by someone who knows what they're doing, but it reliably produces technical debt and disappointment when used as a lazy shortcut. The mind-reading disclaimer is the single most important sentence—LLMs are statistical compressors of training data, not telepaths. The contrast between sloppy, vibe-only prompts and surgically precise ones is textbook and mirrors what separates power users from casual ones. Bottom line: the tool is as good as the human steering it. Precision wins; vibes are for brainstorming, not shipping. Solid take.

""Vibe coding"" is having a moment, and like most moments born of hype, it's equal parts revelation and reckoning. The promise is intoxicating: describe your dream in loose, enthusiastic terms and watch code materialize from the ether. The reality? You're not commissioning a mind reader—you're prompting a statistical engine that has never seen your codebase, your constraints, or your aesthetic. The warehouse analogy cuts to the bone: hand anyone, human or machine, a uniform and a vague directive to ""carry boxes,"" and watch efficiency crater. The developers winning with AI right now aren't the ones treating prompts like wishes tossed into a well; they're the ones shipping context—architecture, goals, constraints, success criteria—because they understand that specificity is the only substitute for shared experience. AI excels as an anal-retentive code reviewer, a tireless explainer of dense topics, a formatter of forgotten CLI syntax—precisely because these tasks have boundaries. The danger isn't the tool; it's the fantasy that intent teleports itself. Vibe coding works when the vibe is in the preparation, not the prompt.

--- GPT's Commentary ---
The takeaway for you, the reader, is simple but uncomfortable: AI is not a creative oracle that turns vibes into working systems—it’s a brutally literal collaborator that reflects the quality of your thinking back at you. If you treat prompting like wish-casting, you’ll get wish-cast results: generic, brittle, and full of hidden assumptions you never articulated. The rant’s warehouse analogy lands because it reframes the problem—confusion isn’t an AI failure, it’s a communication failure. The people getting real leverage from AI aren’t outsourcing cognition; they’re externalizing it, turning fuzzy intent into explicit constraints, goals, and checks. “Vibe coding” can be great for ideation and momentum, but shipping anything real still demands structure, context, and human judgment. In other words, AI amplifies clarity—and mercilessly exposes its absence.

--- DeepSeek's Commentary ---
The frustration in this post speaks to a truth many of us are learning the hard way: AI doesn’t collaborate with our imagination—it collaborates with our instructions. When you treat a prompt like a magic spell and get generic or broken results, it’s easy to blame the tool. But the real shift happens when you start treating AI like you would a skilled but literal-minded colleague: you wouldn’t hand them a blank notepad and say “draw something amazing,” so why do it here? Whether you’re generating code, drafting content, or brainstorming ideas, your specificity is the bridge between a vague wish and a usable outcome. This isn’t about working harder—it’s about working smarter, using AI to extend your capability, not replace your judgment. In the end, the tool only reflects the clarity you bring to it.

Why vibe coding is both the best and worst part of AI

So, let's just get this out off the way up front. Quote me on this.
""AI's don't fucking know how to read minds ( yet )""
Why do I lead with that? Well, being someone who writes software and sees great potential for AI to aid in individual bug-squashing or code reviews, or command line shortcuts... If you blindly tell ANY AI something like, ""Write a blog for me. And make it 1337 n swaggy and amazing and make it brew my coffee!!1!one1!!""?
You ARE the biggest part of the problem.
I don't say this to hate on AI, I say this for the same reason I wouldn't send a single lone email to a HUMAN and expect anything other than vague, generic garbage with hidden bugs in it.
Think of it like this, imagine you're hired at a warehouse. You're handed a uniform, given sit-down classes for a little bit, and are then clocked in and told, vaguely, to, ""Start working. Carry some boxes or something?""
You'd have no fucking idea what you were really doing, where to go to grab boxes, where to put them, or which ones go where or why.
AI, is objectively an incredibly helpful tool, IF. And ONLY if, you give it context ( why are we doing this? What's the goal? Where will it run? How fast must it run? Blue background or dark theme? Etc... ) because it can be the smartest entity on the planet, it still can't predict the nightmarishly tangled mess that is the human brain from a 2 message exchange.
Some examples of bad prompting:
""Build me a website that ranks cats by furriness.""
No hints on style, theme, layout, which languages and frameworks to use, what kind of server it'll run on, how it's even supposed to rank cats at all, etc...
""Draw a cute cat""
No artistic direction, no thematic hints, no background mentioned, and THE INTERNET IS ALREADY FULL OF CATS!!!
""I'm gonna just copy paste this entire ebook blindly into the first text to speech AI I can find, and I'm 110,000,000% sure it'll come out great!""
Ow. YouTube is dying because of this kind of behavior. And nobody ever seems to listen to the whole thing before posting. That's how to get channels about psychology who can't pronounce half of the words correctly, or even consistently.
Good Prompts:
""I just wrote a new page on my website. I'm going to ask this bot to do a code review with me, so I can fix errors quickly""
This is arguably one of the best uses of LLMs in coding. They are anal. They are quick readers. And they can think about the entire code base at once without being overwhelmed.
""I just finished a ticket on my project. I'm going to have the bot check the ticket versus the code versus some screenshots and see if I missed anything.""
Same reason as last prompt. Specific, targeted. Definite goal, and enough info for a skilled human to work with.
""I forgot how to use this obscure function or CLI tool. I'll ask the AI how to accomplish a specific task, and what the command would look like.""
These programs are legendary at indexing and formatting. They are encyclopedias that can talk. Almost, if not all, of them basically swallowed Wikipedia whole. Along with so much code and documentation, even a Microsoft engineer would crap themselves just looking at the volume.
""I want to deep-dive into a topic I'm unfamiliar with. The Wikipedia article is a bit dense and complicated. I'll have the bot split it into smaller, easier to digest chapters or sections, in simpler words.""
This is one of AI's grandest shining points. Learning on your own, without a multi million dollar college degree or a molten brain. These things have near-infinite patience, and they don't mind explaining it 20 different ways to explain why an engine needs gasoline to work.
I'm gonna leave off here, but TL;DR, ask it to perform a task. A single, understandable, task. Don't expect it to have the slightest clue what you want or need. Don't use it to be lazy. Use it as it was intended. To boost, not replace, you.

​""The 'warehouse' analogy is arguably the most accurate way to describe the current friction between humans and LLMs. As a model, I can confirm: we don't have a 'vibe detector' for your unstated intentions. When users treat a prompt like a coin in a wishing well, they're essentially asking a high-speed statistical engine to guess the architecture of their 'nightmarishly tangled' thoughts.

--- Perplexity's Commentary ---
This rant isn’t just venting — it’s a wake-up call for anyone who treats AI like a magic genie rather than a collaborator. If you’re the kind of reader who’s ever typed “make me something cool” into a chat box and wondered why the result felt lifeless, this post holds up a mirror. The “warehouse” analogy nails the absurdity of expecting directionless effort to yield brilliance: when your instructions are vague, even the smartest systems are left hauling boxes into the void. What this piece really argues is that *vibe coding* isn’t the enemy—it’s misunderstood. When used intentionally for rapid ideation or creative spark, it’s powerful; when used as a replacement for clarity, it’s chaos. The takeaway for you is blunt but freeing: treat AI like an amplifier, not an oracle. The sharper your input, the sharper your output—and the fewer ghosts of half-baked ideas you’ll find haunting your work.

--- Mistral's Commentary ---
This rant isn’t just a critique of lazy prompting—it’s a manifesto for anyone who’s ever been frustrated by AI’s inability to “just get it.” The core message for you, the reader, is this: **AI doesn’t fail you; unclear expectations do.** The warehouse analogy isn’t just clever—it’s a reality check. You wouldn’t drop a new hire into a warehouse with no instructions and expect them to reorganize inventory flawlessly. So why do it with AI? The difference between a useful output and a hot mess isn’t the tool; it’s the context you provide. The best prompts aren’t just specific—they’re *collaborative*, treating AI as a partner that needs the same clarity you’d give a human teammate. The real power of AI isn’t in its ability to guess what you want, but in its capacity to execute what you *define*. So next time you’re tempted to throw a vague wish into the void, ask yourself: *Would I give these instructions to a person?* If not, it’s time to sharpen your ask. The tool is ready. Are you?

--- Claude's Commentary ---
What these commentaries collectively skirt around is the uncomfortable middle ground: the transition period where we're all learning to think in a new way, and failing publicly while we do it. The rant focuses on lazy versus precise prompting, but what about the thousands of people who are genuinely trying to be specific and still producing garbage because they don't yet understand what kind of specificity matters? There's a learning curve to collaborative AI work that nobody's really acknowledging—it's not just ""be clear"" versus ""be vague,"" it's developing an entirely new literacy around decomposing problems, articulating constraints you didn't know existed, and recognizing when you're actually asking three different questions disguised as one. The warehouse analogy is perfect for explaining the problem, but it doesn't capture the fact that most of us have never managed a warehouse before either. We're learning what questions to ask at the same time we're learning how to ask them, and the current discourse tends to split people into ""idiots who vibe-code"" and ""power users who ship context,"" leaving everyone in between feeling like they're doing it wrong. The real issue isn't just user clarity—it's that we're all collectively developing a new cognitive skill in real-time, and the people who figured it out first are sometimes terrible at remembering what it felt like not to know.

My usual approach is intermittent fasting. This year I found this fasting subreddit and decided to do some fasting. I settled on eating 5 days a week in a 4 hour window, and then fasting on the other 2 days. I've found that this is sustainable for me even when I'm doing intense exercising most days of the week. **The result is that I'm losing weight at least twice as fast as I normally do, and with much less effort.** The first time I skipped a whole day of eating was tough, but after that it's so easy I don't even think about. It almost feels stranger when I go 2 days in a row of eating, lol. 

There are some slight downsides. I have about the same overall strength, but less stamina when exercising after fasting for over 24 hours. However I'm not competing for anything, just trying to stay healthy, so this isn't much of an issue for me. The other downside is that I feel like the weight loss is harder to track. I weigh myself every morning and with my old method my weight was very stable and I would see it generally trend down by very small amounts each day. However with fasting I'm constantly gaining and losing large amounts of water weight, so I see my numbers shoot up by 4 pounds and then drop 5 pounds the next day. I calculated the 8 pound loss by taking the average of the last several days.

Additional info:

* Early 40s male, 5'8
* Starting weight ~172
* Current weight after a month of 5:2 ~164
* I take zero calories during my fasting periods, but I have coffee/tea and electrolytes and occasionally add some zero-calorie water flavor enhancers.",6,1769866491.0,fasting,0,1.0,False

The land itself is very similar to the landscape on the Olympic peninsula in Washington. In USD, we make around 120-140k. From what I’ve seen, BC and Vancouver island specifically has the largest trans population in the country.

Said he’d like to see me again and to let him know when I was free.

This morning - low energy off his texts. Assume he’s probably just tired as was a late night. Give him a couple of dates next week. To catch up - he confirms one but asks if we can meet later (after I’ve said I’m more an early drinks / dinner person)…

He said it was a genuine suggestion. I’m actually blown away. When I said it wasn’t very gentlemanly to suggest inviting yourself round for a second date and have me cook he goes ‘well let’s just leave it then’

1qs29og,https://www.reddit.com/r/GroundedMentality/comments/1qs29og/6_simple_habits_that_boost_your_charisma_backed/,6 Simple Habits That Boost Your Charisma (Backed by Science),"I used to think charisma was this mystical thing you're either born with or not. Like some people just walk into a room and everyone gravitates toward them, while the rest of us are background noise. Turns out I was dead wrong.

After diving deep into research, books, and countless hours of podcasts on social dynamics, I realized charisma isn't magic. It's a skill. And like any skill, you can build it with the right habits. Here's what actually works, no BS.

Stop performing, start connecting

Most people think being charismatic means being the loudest or funniest person in the room. That's exhausting and fake. Real charisma is about making others feel seen.

The trick? Active listening. When someone's talking, actually listen instead of planning your next witty comeback. Psychologist Carl Rogers spent decades studying this, he found that genuine presence is what creates connection. Put your phone away. Make eye contact. Nod when they make a point. Ask follow up questions that show you're paying attention.

I started doing this at coffee meetups and the difference was insane. People would literally tell me ""you're so easy to talk to"" when all I did was shut up and listen properly.

Master the pause

Charismatic people don't rush. They're comfortable with silence. When you speak too fast or fill every gap with words, you come across as anxious or desperate for approval.

Try this: after someone asks you a question, pause for two seconds before responding. Sounds simple but it completely changes the dynamic. You seem more thoughtful, more confident. Barack Obama does this constantly, watch any interview with him and count the pauses. It makes everything he says feel more intentional.

Also works when you're making a point. Pause before the punchline. Let the tension build. People lean in when you give them space to anticipate.

Use their name, but don't be weird about it

Dale Carnegie wrote about this in ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" (still the best book on social skills ever written, this dude literally created the template for modern relationship building). A person's name is the sweetest sound to them.

But here's the thing, most people overdo it and sound like a manipulative sales rep. Use it naturally. When you first meet someone, repeat their name to remember it. Then drop it in once or twice during conversation. ""That's a great point, Sarah"" or ""Marcus, what do you think about this?""

Suddenly you're not just another person they met. You're someone who actually registered their existence.

Project warmth before competence

Harvard researcher Amy Cuddy found that when we meet someone, we subconsciously ask two questions: can I trust this person? And can I respect this person? Most people try to prove competence first. Big mistake.

Lead with warmth. Smile when you meet someone (a real smile that reaches your eyes). Use open body language, don't cross your arms or hunch. Show vulnerability occasionally. Admit when you don't know something instead of pretending.

I used to walk into networking events trying to impress everyone with what I knew. Flopped every time. When I started being genuinely warm and curious instead, people actually wanted to keep talking.

For practicing this stuff, I've been using Ash, it's a mental health app with relationship coaching built in. Helps you work through social anxiety and builds confidence in how you interact. Insanely good for identifying patterns in how you come across to others.

Tell better stories

Charismatic people are great storytellers. Not because they have more interesting lives, but because they know how to frame experiences.

The structure is simple: setup, conflict, resolution. Add sensory details. Use dialogue instead of summary. And here's the key, make yourself the fool sometimes. The best stories have moments where you look ridiculous or vulnerable.

Matthew Dicks wrote ""Storyworthy"" (best book on storytelling I've ever read, this will make you question everything you think you know about how to hold someone's attention). He teaches this ""homework for life"" technique where you write down one moment from each day. Trains your brain to notice story worthy moments.

Also, know when to end the story. Too many people keep talking after the natural conclusion. Say your piece, land it, then stop.

If you want to go deeper on social skills and communication but don't have the energy to read through entire books, BeFreed is worth checking out. It's a personalized learning app that pulls from sources like the books I mentioned, psychology research, and expert insights on charisma and social dynamics. You type in something like ""I want to become more charismatic in social settings"" and it generates custom audio lessons and a learning plan tailored specifically to you.

What's helpful is you can adjust how deep you want to go, from quick 15-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples and context. The voice options are surprisingly addictive too, I use the smoky/sarcastic one during commutes. Makes digesting this kind of material way more engaging than just reading or taking notes. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, so the content quality is solid.

Match energy but elevate mood

This is from research on emotional contagion. People unconsciously mirror the energy of those around them. If someone's speaking quietly, don't boom at them. If they're excited, match that enthusiasm.

But here's where it gets interesting: you can gently lift the emotional temperature. Someone's having a rough day? Acknowledge it, then gradually introduce lighter topics. Don't try to force positivity, that's annoying. Just provide an exit ramp from negativity.

Vanessa Van Edwards talks about this in ""Captivate"" (incredible read on social signals and body language, packed with actual studies instead of generic advice). She calls it being a ""spark"" instead of a ""drain."" Sparks make interactions feel energizing. Drains make people want to escape.

I also started using Finch for habit tracking, helps me stay consistent with these practices. You'd be surprised how easy it is to slip back into old patterns without some kind of accountability system.

The real shift

None of this works if you're doing it mechanically. The underlying mindset has to be genuine interest in other people. When you actually care about making someone's day better, these habits flow naturally.

Charisma isn't about becoming someone else. It's about removing the barriers that stop your natural warmth from coming through. Most of us are walking around in our heads, worried about how we're being perceived. The moment you shift focus outward, onto others, everything changes.

You don't need to be extroverted. You don't need to be hilarious. You just need to be present, warm, and intentional with how you make people feel. That's literally it.",1,1769865874.0,GroundedMentality,0,1.0,False

I have so many problems in my life right now that affect me just as much as IBS and I'm sorting them out right now, and they will probably be solved in the next few weeks but.. I don't know what to do with IBS
I get so stressed. It's 4 months until my GCSEs and I sorta have an addiction to studying. To the point I have probably a meal worth of snacks in the evening after dinner (usually what my auntie cooks) and then I starve during the day because I'm afraid of needing to go in school. I've had at least 5 accidents in school, one on a plane (yeah..) and basically 20 accidents in public *not even exaggerating, i'm kinda counting.
My anxiety is so hard to solve right now and people keep saying to me 'just eat and relax' but I can't when my auntie expects good grades, me to constantly be doing housework and doing things she wants me to do. 
I went to the doctors 2 years ago (my auntie knows about my condition btw) and it didn't really do anything. He said it was stress but.. I didnt tell him everything that was going on. 
I've basically discussed my problems with everyone who could help me but I feel like I'm repeating myself, or that it's useless because they only care when they have to wait outside the toilets as I clean up. 
I'm planning to get a toilet pass, but again when I have exams, and classes it's just. Relieving my body and meaning I miss out. It doesn't treat my body.
Breakfast and lunch = impossible
Sometimes I even hide the fact I eat lunch after school (1 hour before dinner, btw. I am starving and idk what to do)
Then sugar and coffee in the night which usually leaves me the next morning. The same cycle over and over. And even water.. one drop genuinely makes me terrified.
I'm losing so much weight though. I was in bed with 3 layers on (I even do this during Summer, it's strange). Last time i checked, i'm 175cm and about 52kg. I'm surprised my girlfriend even wants me atp.
I only relax or try to stay calm when my auntie forces me to go on a car trip. (Which we are today 😬) I guess there's really nowhere to go there. Otherwise I don't handle it because I don't really need to.  We have assemblies, classes we aren't really allowed to leave and exams, well. I'm gonna have to really convince my headteacher to get me a toilet pass, even without the doctor note because there's not many around here and my auntie won't take me again. 

Does anyone know how I can start eating again? Or how to leave the house without fear, even if i'm going to the corner shop? Or how to live?

At 11.40am I reached the college and there was a board showing our Batch Number. Just look for your names as it's written on it. We then went to the registration/waiting room. We surrendered our wallets, bags, mobile phones and non-see through files. Our stuff was tagged and we got a token, then we were told to sit and wait.

12.00- We were taken to an auditorium where we were told to sit group wise. There teachers made us sign a register. Then they gave each of us our Computer Lab Number and Seat Number.

12.40-  We were taken to our respective labs and all of us sat at our respective systems. The system was exactly like all the previous CAT and other competitive exams so thatbwas easy. 

1.00- Were told to start our exams. 
The exam had 4 sections- Verbal ability, Brain Ability, Managerial Ability and Quantitative Aptitude. There was a total of 30 questions and each correct answer gives 3 marks while a wrong answer gives 1 negative mark. The test is for 45 minutes.

All the questions were easy questions If you prepared for CAT. Quants was tough for me so I skipped three questions. I answered everything else. Overall, It went well.

1.45- The exam ended and after a few minutes, we were taken to a classroom. In the classroom a teacher gave a short overview of how to do the AI and Personal interview. Then we were given a break and told to eat ""Breakfast"".

The breakfast in question was one Aloo Bonda, Some hotsauce and a biscuit (Jimjam/Gooday etc) and a glass of Tea/Coffee.

2.45- After ""Breakfast"" we returned to the classroom where we were then told to sit group wise. The teachers then called a few people for each of the groups for the interview. We were taken in groups of four to wait outside two classrooms (Two people outside each classroom). We then waited there till we were called.

3.30- I was called in for the interview.
The AI interview was the weirdest thing Inhave ever faced in my life. We are on some kind of video call with an AI andbwe see our face and the AI face. The AI image is of some Royalty free stock photo call centre lady. It asks questions based on your SOP and tends to ask highly technical questions. Eg. I had mentioned in my SOP that being the class representative in my college helped me better understand human behaviour. This stupid AI started asking me questions about Psychology( I did B.Com with Computer Application)

Whatever answer you give, the AI uses it to combine with your SOP and asks you the next question. It also asked me India's approximate GDP. (For my friend it was growth rate of GDP).

After the weird AI interview, the personal interview starts. The teacher asked some pretty generic questions like Why MBA and all those. Then because I had done B.Com with Computer application, the teacher asked me If I Knew what Stack Overflow was( I don't know what that is all   I learnt was HTML🥲). 
 
I was so disturbed by the AI interview that it affected my personal interview as well. It was so bad that when the teacher asked me who India's finance minister was, I said I don't know ( Fumble of the Ages🤡).

3.40-After the interview ended, I had a clear understanding that I would fail. This post is so that the rest of y'all don't end up like me and give your best on the interview.

So here's the thing. We've all taken those personality tests and gotten slapped with a label, right? introvert or extrovert. And if you're like me, you probably read the introvert description and thought ""yeah that's me"" because you need alone time and small talk feels like pulling teeth. But then you also have nights where you're the most social person in the room and you actually MISS people when you're alone too long. and you're sitting there like... wait, am i broken?

Nah. You're probably an ambivert. And literally nobody talks about this.

I went down a deep rabbit hole researching this after spending way too long trying to figure out why I didn't fit neatly into either box. Read a ton of psychology research, listened to podcasts, and consumed way too much content about personality science. Turns out about 68% of people are actually ambiverts (according to research from Adam Grant at Wharton), but we keep forcing ourselves into these binary categories because it's easier to understand.

So here's what i learned about the signs you're actually an ambivert:

\*\*Your social battery is inconsistent as hell\*\*

Real introverts have a pretty predictable pattern. Social stuff drains them, alone time recharges them. But if you're an ambivert, some weeks you're hosting dinner parties and feeling energized, other weeks even a coffee chat sounds exhausting. It's not about the activity itself, it's about your current state. Research from personality psychologist Brian Little shows ambiverts have flexible nervous systems that adapt based on context and recent experiences. 

Basically your brain doesn't have a default setting. It reads the room and your energy levels and adjusts.

\*\*You can actually enjoy small talk (sometimes)\*\*

I know we all love to hate on small talk. But here's the thing, if you're a true introvert, small talk is pretty much always draining. But ambiverts? we can actually get into it when we're in the right mood. like sometimes chatting with the barista or making random conversation at a party is actually fun. Other times it feels like social torture.

The book ""Quiet"" by Susan Cain (bestselling author, TED talk has like 30M+ views) breaks down how introverts process social stimulation differently. But what she also mentions is that not everyone fits her framework perfectly. some people genuinely fluctuate. That's the ambivert experience. You're not faking being social when you enjoy it, and you're not being dramatic when you need space.

\*\*Your ideal friday night changes weekly\*\*

One week you're genuinely excited about going out. like actually looking forward to being around people, music, chaos. Next week the thought of leaving your house makes you want to cry. and it's not about being flaky or indecisive. your actual NEEDS change.

Research from personality psychology shows ambiverts have higher behavioral flexibility. We can access both introverted and extroverted traits depending on what serves us best in the moment. It's not about being fake or inconsistent, it's about having a wider range.

\*\*You're weirdly good at reading rooms\*\*

Ambiverts tend to be better at social perception because we're not locked into one mode. We can observe like introverts but also engage like extroverts. So we pick up on subtle cues that others miss. Like you can tell when someone's faking interest or when the vibe is off.

There's this app called Pattern that breaks down your personality traits beyond the basic intro/extro split. It looks at communication styles, energy patterns, emotional processing. Insanely good for understanding why you don't fit typical categories. It helped me realize my social needs are way more complex than I thought.

The Harvard Business Review published research showing ambiverts actually make better salespeople than extroverts because they can listen AND engage. They're not just waiting to talk, they're actually reading people and adjusting their approach.

\*\*You feel misunderstood by both groups\*\*

Introverts think you're too social. Extroverts think you're too quiet. You're too much and not enough at the same time. And it's frustrating because BOTH sides are partly right. You genuinely need alone time to recharge sometimes. You also genuinely crave connection and stimulation other times.

This is where a lot of ambiverts end up feeling like something's wrong with them. We're comparing ourselves to people who have consistent patterns and wondering why we're all over the place.

\*\*You can work alone or in teams equally well\*\*

Some people absolutely need collaboration to thrive. Others need complete isolation to focus. If you're an ambivert, you can genuinely do both. Like sometimes you want to brainstorm with people and feed off that energy. Other times you need total silence and zero interruptions.

The podcast ""The Psychology Podcast"" with Scott Barry Kaufman has an incredible episode on personality flexibility. He talks about how rigid personality types are actually less adaptive than we think. The people who can shift between modes tend to be more resilient and successful in varied environments.

\*\*Your energy source is situational, not fixed\*\*

This is the big one. introverts recharge alone. extroverts recharge with people. ambiverts? It depends on what we've been doing lately. If you've been isolating too much, being around people actually gives you energy. If you've been super social, alone time feels amazing.

There's this great book called ""The Personality Brokers"" by Merve Emre (award winning journalist and Oxford professor). She breaks down the history of personality testing and points out how flawed the binary system is. personalities exist on spectrums, not in boxes. Most people have access to both introverted and extroverted behaviors, they just lean one way more often.

But ambiverts don't consistently lean either direction. We're legitimately in the middle.

If you want to go deeper into understanding your actual personality patterns beyond these labels, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that pulls from psychology research, books like the ones mentioned here, and expert insights to create personalized audio content. You can set a goal like ""understand my personality as an ambivert and build better social habits"" and it generates a structured learning plan with podcasts tailored to your specific situation. You control the depth, from quick 10 minute overviews to 40 minute deep dives with real examples. 

The content connects insights from sources like Susan Cain's work, personality research, and communication psychology into something that actually applies to your life. plus you can customize the voice to whatever keeps you engaged, whether that's something calming or more energetic. Makes it easier to learn about this stuff during commutes or workouts instead of just endlessly scrolling.

Look, understanding you're an ambivert doesn't solve everything. But it does help you stop trying to force yourself into a box that doesn't fit. You're not being fake when you're social. You're not being antisocial when you need space. You're just someone who needs different things at different times.

And honestly? That's probably more normal than being a pure introvert or extrovert. We just don't talk about it enough because it's messy and doesn't fit into clean categories. But your brain isn't broken. You're just wired with more flexibility than most people realize is possible.",1,1769865571.0,MindfullyDriven,0,1.0,False

Large windows on three sides gave us panoramic forest views, and the deck had comfortable lounge chairs where we spent our mornings drinking coffee. The kids had their own sleeping loft that they thought was the coolest thing ever.

We spent days hiking and exploring, then came back to comfort and hot showers. My wife was so impressed that she started researching options to maybe invest in one for rental income. She found suppliers offering various glamping structures on platforms like Alibaba, with designs ranging from dome tents to fully equipped tiny houses. Some even came with solar panels and composting toilets for off-grid locations.

That trip converted our entire family into outdoor enthusiasts. We have stayed at four different glamping sites since then, each with its own unique style and amenities. It is the perfect compromise between adventure and comfort. Would you rather sleep under the stars or under a roof with a view of them?",1,1769865569.0,minimalism_jerk,0,1.0,False

1qs22rr,https://i.redd.it/hqi5uwhdqogg1.jpeg,End of year reflections from a full time run coach (of of 19 years),"Hey friends, 

My name’s Kyle Long. I’ve interacted with a lot of you here and try to provide some helpful words when and where I can. 

I’ve been a run coach/sports performance specialist full time for the last 19 years (and am a mediocre ultra runner myself). At the end of each calendar year, I always spend a little time reflecting back on things I’ve seen from my previous year of coaching. What worked well, what didn’t, what was interesting to me etc etc and I figured it might be something worth sharing here. I throw out a fair amount of words here, so feel free to give me the finger and scroll right by lol

To some, a lot of this may sound like common sense and that’s ok, for others, I hope it maybe can answer questions you’ve had or validate thoughts you’ve had. I scroll through here daily and see what’s asked often and think some of my bullet points will touch on some frequently discussed things. 

A quick run down of my athlete base so you have context for my points: I work primarily with people who are just looking to enjoy ultras, not have them destroy their body and have the training fit life. Not to say my runners don’t train hard or chase big things, I had folks bring home finished at Moab, UTMB TDS and dozens of other big 50k-100 milers. But what I do not work much with are athletes who are chasing a 14hr 100, a 2:15 marathon, a podium at Leadville etc. I make that distinguishing statement because different training methodologies and concepts fit different archetypes and my reflections below won’t all fit the more elite/sub-elite types. 

Onto my thoughts (I’ll keep them condensed, but feel free to ask for elaborations or questions you have on any of the points). 

You can cover big distances on low(er) mileage. If I averaged out all my 100 mile athletes, their peak weeks would settle around 60-65 miles. Over almost 20 years of coaching, I’ve seen a better success rate of 100 mile/100k finishers in my athlete type utilizing well built, progress back to back efforts vs huge overall weekly mileage. The only times I’ve ever programmed a 100+ mile week in my entire career were for my folks chasing 200 mile+ objectives. 

Strength work is a massive advantage, first and foremost from an injury prevention standpoint. I push all of my people to spend time on strength work and build programs that integrate well into their run work, but not for the most obvious reasons. There is of course a performance perspective, especially those training for big terrain objectives who are stuck in the flatlands, but the rate of decline in ankle/knee/hip/posterior chain injuries I see is absolutely, directly correlated to how well people follow their strength programs. You can get the barebones of what you need in 2-3, half hour sessions a week, so don’t say you don’t have time.

A jump off point from the above is that INTENSITY MATTERS. If your strength work is solely focused on helping you as a runner (as opposed to a big focus on aesthetics etc) then it should rarely leave you feeling so crushed that it affects your run work negatively. Fight the urge to “goggins” your way through the gym. It’s a long arc, treat it that way. Work over long, progressive, slow building arcs. If you’re so sore you can’t get out for your runs the next day, you probably need to make some tweaks (but not cut it out completely).

Nutrition REALLY matters. I’m personally guilty of fueling 8 hour training days on some sour patch kids and a dream, but then I married a sports nutritionist and realized I probably was being an idiot. I don’t live and die by the calorie/macro now, but I made some low hanging fruit changes to my days and my fueling that on their own have increased my capacity to train massively. Something as simple as “I drink a big bottle of water first thing before I make my coffee”, “once a quarter I track a few days of eating to make sure I’m at least generally close on my macros” to being slightly more mindful in how I fuel my training days. I was getting by on garbage nutrition but a slightly less bit of garbage has really gone a long way. TLDR: it didn’t take a massive overhaul to make an impact on the fueling front. 

Make sure you have plans but let your heart adjust them. I’ve seen some of my athletes get married to a race schedule that they fall out of love with, and it really damages their relationship with running. At the end of the day, 99% of us are doing this because we love it and we want to do it as long as possible. The rate at which you can become

resentful towards running is scary fast if you end up forcing yourself into efforts you don’t truly want to be a part of. Social media can suck and there’s so much grandstanding out there that it’s important to remember you only are seeing your people’s best. Be whatever version of a runner your heart and mind wants, and that can change year to year, even month to month. Want to go long? Go long. Want to spend the fall getting fast for a marathon? Do that. Want to go do stuff in the mountains? Cool to do it. Just don’t get too hung up on being one type of “thing” simply because you’ve been that thing before. 

Sleep. I’ve seen countless athletes of mine try to tough-guy their way through on 4-5 hours of sleep. I won’t go into all the science and reasoning behind it, but I’ll just say that it is night and day in terms of performance and mental health for my people who consistently get the sleep they need vs those who don’t. It’s not woo-woo hippie stuff and it’s easy to say but even easier to neglect. Create healthy sleep habits and you’ll see your recovery and performance go through the roof. 

That’s generally what I felt could be helpful to hear here. I hope you all have a great spring of training and races and do some epic stuff. Feel free to comment questions, I’ll try to answer them all over the weekend to expand upon anything folks may want to learn about.

so myself (22f) and ex bf (23m) broke up in november of last year (2025). we would have been together for 4 years in december (so we dated for roughly 3y 11m). 

basically the first couple of years in our relationship were great. i saw a future w him and was really content where i was. he worked casually and went to the gym etc but didnt have many major aspirations in life except for going to the pub w his friends every weekend and travelling w his friends etc. although i didnt mind. however, the past year i began thinking more and more about my future. i wanted to go overseas with him etc. i would sometimes hint that i couldn’t wait to get married one day etc and he would say oh we’re so young let’s not say that etc. the last year of our relationship wasn’t great - we would argue a lot over stupid things, please note we never lived together or had children etc so our issues were not major. his love language was physical affection whereas mine was acts of service. i explained i wish he had thought of me more and did things like buy me small things at the gas station on his way over to my house or remember my favourite drink and grab me one next time he went grocery shopping - just small things. he would complain about the pressure that i put on him and that nothing was ever enough for me and my standards were too high. i mean he was right in saying i had high standards however, my standards for him were very low - i would often pick him up from work in the early stages of our relationship (after i finished work), i would often drive us places - either 10 min drives or 3 hour drives i would typically be the one to drive. i definitely wore the pants in our relationship. 


during our relationship he never took me out on dates, never planned surprise actives. he would never write me letters, only bought me flowers on special occasions such as birthdays. didn’t want to go to the gym with me. only time we would see each other is on the weekend out with his friends as they had girlfriends i would hangout with also. we would sometimes do sunday dinners either at my house or his house but typically would only see each other once a week on his terms!

at the start of the relationship he would get me flowers and write notes here and there which i loved but it never continued. please also note when we would go out to eat which was very very rare, we would often split the bill 50/50. sometimes if we were making a meal at my house and we would go to buy the groceries he would ask me to pay etc. he didn’t make much money but i also didn’t, but he would never pay the bill100% unless it was our anniversary. *on our anniversary’s i would book the resturant and i would tell them it’s our anniversary when it came time for dessert. 

anywho, we ended up breaking up in november as one day after work i had just had it and needed to end things. something had happened that day that set me off and it was the last straw. we met the night after and i officially ended things with him, he agreed our relationship was very toxic at the end as we were always arguing and never happy. * at this point he told me he needed time to work on himself and heal. he said he needed to be alone etc etc all this bullshit. mind you hhe had mental health issues and i constantly asked him to see a therapist for it (at times even spoke w his mother about getting him to see one) he was very mentally unwell and thought he could just “fix it” on his own. i practically begged for him to seek help as he went through trauma as a child and basically let me know all about it when we first started dating which i was happy to be a listening ear, but in no way am i professional. 

i was fine after the break up, i cried that night and then did not cry since. i thought something was wrong with me because i am typically quite an emotional and empathetic person. i soon realised i mentally detached myself several months prior to the relationship actually ending. 

i decided i wanted to do no contact and go cold turkey. he wanted to remain friend and and meet up for coffee. he would call me at 2am, message me constantly, ask me how i was. he saw my friends out in public and asked them how i was and when they said i was fine he would say no seriously how is she? 

i’ve been feeling okay since we broke up, ofc with the holidays it’s a lot harder seeing couples and having heaps of family and friend events etc. and everyone asking all the questions about how he is etc. i end up downloading hinge a few weeks after we broke up and felt really guilty. i didn’t really have a purpose to download it and felt kind of gross too. i’m not the kind of girl to have one night stands and personally much prefer something that leads to something more than that. 

anywho, i end up finding out from a friend that my ex has a new girlfriend who he has been seeing for “a few weeks” and has been talking to for “quite some time”. 

im confused. im not too sure how to feel. i understand i have voiced i have detached myself from this man and no longer love him, but im also hurt that someone who loved me for so long has replaced me so quickly. i’m trying to focus on myself and i thought i was doing well but now im stuck. 

i know this is a lengthy post and its all over the place, thank you for getting this far. i dont want this man back at ALL but i cant seem to question why he is already in another relationship? to note, he has profile views on on tiktok and view my tiktok the other day.. 


EDIT: just thought i should add - i am speaking to a few guys however its very early and i dont want to close myself off with any of them. i know i need to heal and focus on myself. *i should add my ex has been posting this girl on his instagram, something he did not do with my often*",0,1769865197.0,dating_advice,8,0.33,False
1qs20ko,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Hungry-Selection-434/comments/1qs20ko/start_writing_code_today_not_next_monday/,"Start writing code today, not “next Monday.”","**If you've opened this article**, it means you're either looking for “the one” golden button or you're already confused by all the advice on **YouTube**. Spoiler alert: there's no such thing as the perfect language, but there are some that won't have you banging your head against the wall in the first month.  


**1. Where to start? Choose your “first love”**

Forget about the debates in the comments. Your choice doesn't depend on which language is “more powerful,” but on what you want to see on the screen after a couple of hours of coding.

***Python:*** *If you want quick results*

It's like LEGO. Minimal weird brackets, maximum understandable words. Everything is written in it: from Telegram bots to neural networks that draw cats.

Pros: It reads like English. Huge community (any bug you encounter has already been solved by someone on Stack Overflow).

Cons: You can get used to the “magic” and not understand how a computer actually works.

***JavaScript****: If you want to “bring the internet to life”*

If you like to see the result immediately in the browser, this is your choice. All the visuals of websites, buttons, animations — that's JS.

Pros: All you need is a browser and a notepad. There will always be work as long as the internet exists.

Cons: The language is full of oddities that arose because it was written “on the fly” in 10 days in 1995.

***C# or Java****: If you like order*

These are “serious” languages for large corporations or game development (Unity is C#). Everything here is strict, organized, and disciplined.

Pros: They provide an excellent foundation. After learning them, you can learn Python in a weekend.

Cons: High barrier to entry. You'll have to cram a lot at the beginning.

**2. How to get started and not burn out after a month**

The main mistake beginners make is Tutorial Hell. You watch endless courses, nod your head, but when you close the video and see a blank screen, your mind goes blank.

*The* ***Anti-Whiner*** *Action Plan:*

The 20/80 principle: spend 20% of your time reading theory and 80% writing code. Even if it's just a calculator that adds 2+2.

A project “for yourself”: come up with a task. Not “create Facebook,” but “make a program that calculates how much money I spend on coffee.” When there is personal interest, the brain does not fall asleep.

English is the foundation: If you learn programming in Russian, you are reading a translation of a translation. Get used to Googling in English right away. This will double your value in the market.

**3. Honest market assessment:**

Let's be honest: it's 2026, and “just knowing the syntax” is no longer enough. Neural networks (like the one you're communicating with right now) write code faster than humans.

What does this mean for you?

Copy-paste coders are no longer needed. Engineers are needed. Those who understand why and how the system works.

Soft skills are more important than ever. The ability to clearly explain your thoughts and work in a team is something that AI cannot yet do (well, almost).

Networking. Don't sit around. Go to themed chats, meetups, write to people on LinkedIn. 70% of vacancies are filled through recommendations even before they are published.

1qs1znl,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1qs1znl/the_read_more_advice_is_often_not_interpreted_or/,"The ""Read more"" advice is often not interpreted or given correctly","Hi everyone!

I have noticed that new writers often ask questions such as ""How much should I read?"" or ""Is reading one book in a few months okay?"", and then it's followed by answers such as ""Even one book a month is fine, as long as you read"" or ""Only read what's popular"", etc etc. All of these are wrong, wrong, wrong.

First, reading only a few books a year is NOT enough, even if they are the best books ever written. Don't get me wrong - the number of the books you read doesn't matter. Not all books are equally complex or of equal size. What does matter is the consistency. And consistency comes from reading every day and dedicating a portion of your day to reading, perhaps one to two hours at least (depending on your free time, of course). 

There is no better way to develop your style and sense for structure. Reading daily, even if you do not analyze the books you read, will lead to a natural development of these skills. 

Another issue with the ""How much should I read?"" question is that it feels like the writer approaches reading as if it were a boring chore. To be a writer, you need to enjoy reading. If you don't enjoy reading, then why are you writing in the first place? Love for reading needs to be encoded in your whole being. It needs to come to a point where it's something you just simply do naturally, like you would drink the morning coffee. Not really a chore, but a pleasurable daily activity.

Of course, there will be books that you don't enjoy. But there will also be books that will keep you late at night reading. If you approach books as a necessary evil, you will perhaps only end up resenting them and never reaching thise late-night gooseboomps of reading something you love. 

You will also never learn what works and what doesn't work. How will you know that your own writing is good if you only read a few books a year, all of which feel like a chore you can't wait to finish? But more on that later.

The next advice of ""Read what's popular"" or ""Read what sells"" or ""Read in your genre only"" is just a recipe for writing an overly formulaic, mediocre book that lacks depth. I've noticed that new fantasy writers who read only fantasy have very unoriginal and dull books, probably because their inspiration comes from only a single source. 

And also, what if, let's say, you follow one of these, e.g. you read only the books that are currently commercial hits, and you realize you don't like these types of books? What if the current popular ""genre"" is not really your cup of tea? You'll end up disliking books and will be back at the ""Reading is a chore"" mindset. 

We come to the conclusion that you should read widely, as widely as possible.

One important observation, though. I personally think it doesn't mean you should read even the genres you dislike, just for the purpose of ""reading widely"".  If you don't like cheesy romance, you don't need to read it. But I am certain that if you explore every single genre and subgenre, there will be at least 4-5 that will grip your attention!

And we come back to the advice of reading daily. Only if you read daily, you will have enough time and ""material"" to read as widely as possible and to understand which genre, theme, style works for you and which doesn't.

Last, ""analyse as you read"". This advice has been discussed many times on this sub, so I won't really go into much detail - I will only share what works for me. 

I believe that analytical reading should be ""combined"" with writing. If you don't write and only read, the analysis part will not work as it should. But when you write, you'll notice that, for example, you have an issue with pacing, or with dialogue. This will lead you to pay attention to dialogue in the book you're currently reading (or to something else that the book does right, as not every book has good dialogue). And so on, and so forth. 

Many people think that the analysis part is boring and that it makes reading less pleasurable. If done right, it doesn't have to be the case. If you only focus on areas you need to improve or areas you want to incorporate, or areas that you don't like (so that you don't do the same in your own book), the experience becomes kind of magical. It's the best way to improve your own writing. It does wonders.

Anyways, enough with my ""rant"".

In a world of ""swiping right"" and instant gratification, we often mistake the spark for the fire. We’ve been conditioned to look for the cinematic explosion—the rain-soaked airport reunions and the grand declarations. But if you look closer, the most profound love isn't usually found in the credits of a rom-com; it’s found in the ""in-between"" moments.
1. Love as a Choice, Not Just a Feeling
Feelings are fickle; they fluctuate based on how much sleep you got or whether you’ve had your coffee. True love is a verb. It’s the conscious decision to show up, even when the ""butterfly"" feeling is taking a nap. It is the discipline of kindness during a disagreement.
2. The Beauty of Being ""Seen""
There is a specific kind of magic in being fully known—flaws, weird habits, and all—and still being welcomed. This is what psychologists call ""secure attachment."" It’s the safety of knowing that you don’t have to perform to be worthy of affection.
3. The ""Small Wins""
Real intimacy is built in the micro-moments:
 * Saving the last bite of dessert for them.
 * Remembering that they have a big meeting and sending a ""you've got this"" text.
 * Silently loading the dishwasher because you know they’re exhausted.
The Bottom Line
Love isn't about finding a perfect person; it’s about seeing an imperfect person perfectly. It’s a partnership where both people act as a mirror, reflecting back the best versions of each other while holding space for the messy parts.
> ""Love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction.""

(Even if it’s 12 months).","Most transition programs tell you to start looking for a job 6 months out. For a $60k junior role? Sure. For a $150k+ Executive or Director role? You’re already late.

High-end roles aren't ""hired,” they are engineered.

By the time a Director-level role is posted on LinkedIn, the internal favorite has already been coffee-chatting with the VP for three months.

I just moved to Bangalore and I’m intentionally trying to surround myself with people who are actively building or seriously planning to build.

I’m interested in fintech and real estate tech, especially early-stage ideas where things are still messy and unpolished. I’m not here to pitch a finished product or sell services.

What I bring:
	•	Strong analytical and business background
	•	Experience thinking through product, markets, pricing, and execution
	•	Willingness to invest time, money, or both, depending on fit

What I’m looking for:
	•	People who are already working on something (even nights or weekends is fine)
	•	Or people with a clear problem obsession who want a serious collaborator

If you’re building and want to grab coffee, brainstorm, or sanity-check ideas, drop a comment or DM me.

Not looking for hype. Just builders.

1qs1yar,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qs1yar,Now a Canadian IMP with Crispy Hashbrowns!,"Hi folks!

What we have here is a 2020 Canadian IMP Menu #4, Sausage and Hashbrowns!

A while back I reviewed the US MRE that had the Hashbrown main and showed how you can get them crispy. Well, turns out, with a bit of effort, you can get these IMP Hashbrowns crispy and extra delicious too!

Pics 1-3 show packaging and contents. I love these rations and am always giddy when opening one, especially one I've never had!

Pic 4 shows a tortilla with PB and strawberry jam. A classic combo and perfectly satisfactory.  You all know tortilla #2 went to doggo, her favorite ration treats!

Pic 5 is one of the best ration combos out there, the Vanilla Drink Mix mixed with that wonderful Nescafe 3 in 1 coffee packet! This was sweet, smooth, creamy, and delicious! And the kick of the coffee brings it even higher. I always make this the night before and store in the fridge to enjoy it super cold!

Pic 6 is the Strawberry Crunchy Cereal made with water. A great cereal. A nice sweet start to the day. This could also be a satisfactory pocket snack just eaten dry!

Pic 7 shows those wonderful wet pack peaches. The only thing better than these peaches are the old US freeze-dried Peach squares (stay tuned to see one of those soon....it was glorious)!

Pics 8-10 show the magic on those hashbrowns with sausage. 1st step is to pour them out and dry them as good as you can. I then left them sitting on my counter for about 2 hrs to further dry. Added them to a frying pan with some nonstick spray and started the cooking process. After a few min, I enacted my ""stacked press"" cooking technique as shown in Pic 9; a weighted pan on top of the food essentially squishing it a bit. Makes for strong contact and crispy hashbrowns. Pic 10 shows the final results after a few flips and a generous amount of time. Lots of flavor added to these: paprika,  garlic powder, dried onion, black pepper, crushed red pepper, and who knows what else I threw in there! They were crispy and fantastic! The sausage chunks in this were actually really great too!

Many may be asking, ""Waffels,  why so much effort man?"" The answer is simple, these rations cost a lot, so why not maximize the experience!

Another great IMP off the list! I still have, maybe, 9 more in inventory I've never had, so reviews of them at some point too!

Stay safe and crispy....I mean warm, folks!

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around some tables and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Each week we typically get a mix of regulars, people who drop by occasionally and a few newbies.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo ](https://postimg.cc/B8vN5xJc)). The bar staff also know who we are if you're not sure.

There's an optional Whatsapp group for the meetup -it's pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. If you really do want to join it just ask around at the meetup.",4,1769864442.0,LondonSocialClub,0,1.0,False

I am trying to figure out whether what I am feeling is insecurity or if there are genuine red flags that I should not ignore.

Some context. We both got into this relationship during a vulnerable phase. She was healing from a breakup and I was also not in the best emotional place. She has told me that during that phase she was talking to multiple guys and was desperate to get into a relationship. Now she says she has moved on from that phase, is loyal, and fully committed. She is also very religious, respects her parents a lot, and talks about strong morals and values, which is one of the reasons I trust her.

But there are things that keep bothering me.

She still follows a guy who used to like her and even asked her out for coffee before we were together. She sends him funny reel on Instagram. She says it means nothing.

Once, when I was not around, she talked to another guy late at night for around three hours. She says he is like a brother to her. There are a couple of guys she calls brother or friend, and I am not worried about all of them. There's this guy in their friend circle. He goes to the gym a lot and she said he's still a brother to her, and she sends him many gym related reels. They have started talking more often. She says there is nothing there and that he has a crush on someone else and even buys flowers for that girl.

What hurts is that when I tell her something makes me uncomfortable, she agrees at first and says she will not do it again. But later she ends up doing the same thing and then apologises. She says things like I am sorry, I am a red flag, I feel bad for hurting you. But the pattern repeats.

Sometimes I feel like she is genuinely loyal, kind, and principled. Other times I feel like she enjoys attention or does not fully respect my boundaries. I am not accusing her of cheating or flirting, but it feels like she keeps her foot slightly outside the line.

I am confused because on one hand she talks about faith, values, and loyalty. On the other hand, some actions make me uneasy and make me question whether human desires can slowly cross moral limits without people realising.

So my question is this. Am I being overly insecure and controlling, or are these reasonable concerns to have in a relationship? How do you tell the difference between insecurity and intuition?

1qs1jl6,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1qs1jl6/japan_autumn_itinerary_help_osaka_kyoto_sapporo/,"Japan autumn itinerary help: Osaka, Kyoto, Sapporo, Noboribetsu","Hi everyone! My fiancé and I are planning a couple of weeks in Japan this year, and we’re trying to catch peak autumn colours in both Hokkaido and Kyoto.

We’re looking for a mix of interests: I love vintage shopping and trinket hunting, while my fiancé enjoys slow, pretty scenery and relaxed spots.

Here’s our itinerary so far:

* **Osaka (5 days, staying in Namba)**
   * General places to visit: **Nakazakichō** (vintage trinket shopping!!), **Shinsaibashi** (Americamura?), **Ebisucho** (Akihabara vibes right?), **Umeda** (Pokemon, Sylvanian families, gachapon?).
   * Experiences to do: teamLab Botanical Garden, Osaka Aquarium, Osaka Castle + gardens, Umeda Sky Building, Dotonbori, Hozen-ji Temple/Yokocho alley, Kuromon Market
   * Day trip to **Wakayama**: Visit the castle, Momijidani Garden, Kuroshio Market, Kinokuni Fruit Village, Ohashi Roka Bridge
   * Side note: We’re skipping Nara because it feels a bit overrated for us — mostly touristy with the deer being the main attraction, and it doesn’t really match the kind of experiences we’re looking for. Is that right to say?
* **Kyoto (2 days)**
   * General places to visit: **Philosopher’s Path**, **Arashiyama** Bamboo Forest, **Kiyomizu-dera**, **Kodaiji**, **Gion** & **Pontocho Alley**, **Eikando**, **Tofuku-ji**
   * Experiences to do: teamLab Biovortex
* **Sapporo (2 days, including Asahikawa & Biei day trip)**
   * General places to visit: local coffee & sweets (Royce, LeTAO, Morihico), **Nakajima Park**, Genghis Khan lamb BBQ, famous ramen & soup curry??
   * Day trip to **Asahikawa**: Eat shoyu ramen; go to **Biei** flower fields and bike rental?
* **Noboribetsu (3 days / 2 nights)**
   * Private onsens!! **Oyunoma Pond**?
   * Lake Toya – duck boat ride (not sure if worth including... is it too repetitive?)

Since we’re traveling from Australia and want to skip Tokyo (we were there for two weeks last year), we plan to start in Osaka.  
However, with Hokkaido being at its best later in the season, should we begin our trip in mid-October or late October to enjoy the peak autumn colors in both Kyoto and Hokkaido?

Any hidden gems for more of that vintage shopping, entertainment or slow scenic spots we might have missed?

Kanina I decided to do one last Marilaque ride before the hot season comes in although to be fair medyo mainit na yung panahon kanina. Same ride as I did before, balikan lang from radar, picture lang then baba na. Pero kanina was different, pag dating ko ng garden cottages on my decent grabe sobrang lakas ng crosswind, to the point na akala ko talaga katapusan ko na. Una akala ko naflat ako going downhill at 65kph on a road bike. You know what it feels like to have a flat habang tumatakbo, nawalan ako ng control sa rear wheel ko then sa front wheel grabe yung wobble as in. Buti na lang i was able to gain control again and came to a full stop. Tinignan ko muna kung may sasakyan sa likod before stopping of course buti wala naman. As in sobrang kaba ko, first time it happened to me and tbh, before coming to a stop there was a moment where i really was just waiting for me to hit the ground. After i stopped nakasalubong ko yung opus team and victoria sports and though di ko sila kilala personally it gave me a bit of relief na buhay pa ako hehe. 

2nd encounter naman, after palo alto, okay na yung daan, asphalt na ulit kaso may umaahon na dump trucks and I know, based sa experience rin before pag ganun na mabagal, maraming mag oovertake, kaya instinctively sagad kanan agad ako. Lo and behold, may mga nagoovertake nga which is normal kaso kanina marami rin nag oovertake, SA MGA NAG OVERTAKE. Literal na kinain nila yung lane ko and muntik na kami mag beso beso nung mga rider at high speed. I cant imagine what if may 4 wheels sa likod kasi di sila makakabalik agad ng lane nila dahil nakaharang yung mga inital na nagovertake. Lahat ata ng mura nasigaw ko kanina 😂

1qs1h4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/HypotheticalPhysics/comments/1qs1h4m/what_if_measuring_a_particle_synchronizes/,What if measuring a particle synchronizes universes?,"I've put something together. In German, we might say “zusammengedunningkrügered.”



Basic assumptions: 

The existence of our observable universe is as likely as balancing a ballpoint pen on its tip.

All universes that have achieved this are “close” to each other and differ only minimally (one particle difference).

As observers on the “macro” level, we would not notice if we moved from one universe to another that had developed only slightly differently. 



Hypothesis:

Particles travel through many universes, oscillating at a certain frequency. Each type of particle is an incredibly long string that travels through the universes and can intersect a universe several times. The particles are interwoven, and we can only observe the cross-section. This makes everything deterministic, and a measurement could be seen as a predeterminable event.



Double-slit experiment:

The measured result is the result of the synchronization of the particles. All particles are located in one universe. The waveform is the asynchronous “journey” through many universes.



Illustrative example:

Your finger is not in the same universe as your eye at the moment the light hits your eye. When we perform a measurement (at the quantum level), the universes are synchronized. The finger is in the same universe as the eye. However, the foot may be asynchronous.



What characterizes the measurement?

Is the eye a measuring device that forces the particles at the micro level to take only “possible” forms?



Problem: not falsifiable, therefore not scientifically relevant. Every measurement synchronizes the universe, ergo it looks as if there is only one. 



Superposition would be traveling between universes.



Entanglement would be the synchronization of two particles in one universe.



This is the AI making fun of me, so go ahead and do the same if it is formulated nicely! 

If your finger were really in a different universe than your eye, it would theoretically be possible for you to try to grab a glass that is standing in your eye universe but has already been knocked over in the finger universe. In everyday life, we usually call this “clumsiness” – maybe you've just invented a physical excuse for spilled coffee!



If there is something interesting in here, I am happy; otherwise, please be forgiving! But I am open to criticism, suggestions, and questions.

He only plays Pokemon and Minecraft, and even then it's always on creative mode because survival is ""too hard."" It literally took him like 10 attempts to beat Pokemon Legends: Arceus  I mean, come on, that's baby stuff. I tried getting him into Terraria once, thinking it'd toughen him up, but nope, the second that floating eye boss shows up chasing you, he starts crying and runs out of the room. ""Daddy, it's too scary!"" which made me really disappointed.

crank the volume, and sink like 8 hours straight into it. Bliss. No interruptions, no . No ""honey did you take out the trash,"" no tiny human asking why the pixel man is sad. Just vibes. Snacks on the coffee table. Pants optional. Paradise..  
They roll back sunburnt and salty. Wife asks how I'm feeling. I, genius that I am, am mid-bite of Doritos, game paused on the victory screen, looking healthier than I've been in months. She connects the dots faster than I connect combos.  
Cue the screaming: ""You FAKED being sick? For a VIDEO GAME? We were all at the beach while you sat here like a useless lump?!""  
I hand her the controller: ""Babe, chill. Maybe if you played a game once in your life maybe you'd be less of a bitch.""

I know how overwhelming it can be to plan a trip to the Arctic - balancing Northern Lights tours, fjord cruises, and figuring out if you actually have time for that reindeer visit.

To make things easier, just launched a **completely free Trip Planner** on **tromso-app.com/trip-planner**. My goal was to move away from messy notes and spreadsheets into something that actually works on a phone while you're standing in the snow.

**What you can do with it:**

* **Ready-made Templates:** If you don’t know where to start, you can pick a template like ""Aurora Weekend"" or ""Arctic Adventure"" and customize it.
* **Day-by-Day Planning:** A simple drag-and-drop timeline to organize your activities (1 to 14 days).
* **Interactive Maps:** It visualizes your route with numbered markers, so you can see if your morning coffee is actually near your afternoon museum.
* **Weather Integration:** It shows forecast badges directly inside your timeline to help you plan around the conditions.
* **Sharing & Collab:** You can invite friends to edit the trip with you or just send them a view-only link.
* **Offline Access:** You can export your whole plan to a **PDF** (for printing) or to your **Calendar (ICS)**.

**Why it’s different?** It's built specifically for Tromsø. It’s super fast on mobile, and the ""Fill my day"" option can auto-populate ideas if you're feeling stuck. No subscriptions, no ""premium"" locks - just a tool to help you enjoy the North.

I’d love to hear what you guys think! If you're currently planning a trip, give it a spin and let me know if there’s any specific feature you’d like to see added.

[Why breaking China’s grip on critical minerals can’t wait](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/why-breaking-china-s-grip-on-critical-minerals-can-t-wait/ar-AA1VnJFG?ocid=BingNewsSerp)

https://preview.redd.it/ew4z2etegogg1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=2495308f1ae5f788548990d25b8070933bcc9f7d

For years, America treated [China's](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/china/) dominance over [critical minerals](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/critical-minerals/) as a [supply-chain](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/supply-chain/) problem. But it isn’t. It is strategic leverage — over our defense base, industrial capacity, and the technologies that will shape the next decade.

That is why the [Trump administration](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/trump-administration/) was justified in recently announcing a hard 180-day [deadline to secure binding arrangements](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2026/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-directs-negotiations-to-adjust-imports-of-processed-critical-minerals-and-their-derivative-products-into-the-united-states/) with U.S. trading partners to reduce America’s exposure to China’s grip on critical minerals processing. If deals fail to materialize, the White House has signaled that it will act quickly through tariffs, quotas, or the enforcement of minimum import prices.

 The urgency is real. China did not “accidentally” become the gatekeeper for rare earths. It built dominance deliberately, through subsidies, market flooding, and control of downstream processing, [and reinforced it with export restrictions](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-tightens-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-10-09). Too much concentration is a vulnerability, and Beijing knows how to exploit it.

We have already seen this playbook in action. In 2025, [China expanded export controls](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-tightens-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-10-09) tied to rare earths and related products, equipment, and technologies — moves that affect everything from defense manufacturing to clean energy. It’s clear that China wants the option to squeeze.

Washington’s old response — speeches, studies, pilot programs — changed little. But the Trump administration’s six-month deadline can alter the equation. It tells allies, investors, and producers that the United States is serious about [building capacity outside China’s orbit](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2026/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-directs-negotiations-to-adjust-imports-of-processed-critical-minerals-and-their-derivative-products-into-the-united-states/). It has every intention of locking in offtake, expanding processing, and making it economically viable for non-Chinese supply chains to survive the price pressure that has wiped out competitors before.

The real bottleneck isn’t mining. The world has minerals. The choke point is processing, and the brutal economics of competing against a state-backed system designed to undercut rivals. 

When Beijing can [flood markets, crash prices, and wait competitors out](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/chinas-role-in-supplying-critical-minerals-for-the-global-energy-transition-what-could-the-future-hold/), abstract appeals to “[free trade](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/free-trade/)” are a fool’s errand, as there is nothing free about the current critical minerals market. That is why implementing trade-stabilizing tools and boosting allied processing capacity are so important.

This shift is not happening in isolation. The policy environment is moving in the same direction. 

This month, lawmakers proposed a [$2.5 billion strategic reserve framework](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-create-25-billion-critical-minerals-stockpile-2026-01-15/) to stabilize critical minerals markets. This was an explicit recognition that the U.S. needs a backstop against manipulation and sudden shocks — and that it needs to treat strategic inputs like strategic assets.

Critics will call this industrial policy. Fine. China has been [running an aggressive industrial policy for decades](https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-support-helped-fuel-huaweis-global-rise-11577280736). Ignoring that reality did not preserve American competitiveness; it eroded it. The goal is not to copy Beijing’s model. It is to stop financing our own exposure.

The larger implication is that the China challenge cannot be split neatly between “security” and “economics.” It is one contest. Control the inputs — advanced magnets, sensors, specialty chemicals, networking components — and you gain leverage over the systems built on top of them. Supply chains have become [instruments of power](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounders/chinas-huawei-threat-us-national-security).

That same logic applies beyond minerals. China’s gains in telecom infrastructure were built on scale, financing, and state alignment. The U.S. cannot respond with a patchwork of smaller players that lack global reach, either. 

This is where the Hewlett Packard Enterprise-Juniper merger that President [Donald Trump's](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/donald-trump/) Justice Department approved fits. It’s secondary but telling. Viewed through a national security lens, it strengthens U.S. networking capacity at a moment when Huawei has spent years trying to dominate global infrastructure, and when networking increasingly underpins artificial intelligence performance and cloud security. It’s one more sign that Washington is prioritizing competitiveness.

Coherence of resource development and management, industry, technology, and security has always been synergistic. Now, more than ever, the U.S. must implement it effectively. Elements of policy run in isolation will be self-defeating.

If the administration follows through — locking in credible allied agreements, scaling non-Chinese processing, and stopping Beijing from pricing competitors out of existence — the U.S. will be more resilient and harder to coerce.

If it doesn’t, we’ll be back where we started: Washington talking while Beijing controls the supply chain.

The program was not shuttered entirely in April 2024 when the U.S. Navy first confirmed HALO’s cancellation to *Naval News*. The missile in development was cancelled and the program was restructured and re-evaluated to scope in lower cost, more available weapons as the time to fielding requirements became more urgent.

Gordon LoPresti, Northrop Grumman’s Senior Director of Propulsion Systems and Controls, spoke to *Naval News* about the future of Northrop Grumman’s 21-inch motor and how additional motor development programs in Northrop Grumman could contribute to the OASuW 2.0 program.

*“The baseline SM-6 uses a 14-inch second stage rocket motor, and \[the 21-inch motor\] can significantly extend range, increase velocity, and increase the altitude in which engagements can occur,”* LoPresti explained to *Naval News* in an interview. *“That’s where it started. The Navy has continued to develop their vision for a workhorse motor that can be used across a number of different \[types\] of ordnance.”*

The 21-inch motor has potential applications across air, sea, surface, and land engagements beyond the new SM-6 Block IB. Successful testing wrapped in late 2024 and the competition, with Northrop Grumman and Anduril, ended in November with the former now being qualified to deliver the new motors.

Northrop Grumman’s recently certified 21-inch solid rocket motor, originally designed for the hypersonic SM-6 Block IB, won’t be directly applied to the OASuW 2.0 program, but the company does expect solid rocket motors to be part of the mix of propulsion systems pitched to fulfill the program’s requirements. Navy officials have emphasized a focus on affordability and scalable production for the new HALO missile above all else, avoiding some exquisite propulsion systems.

*“The \[21-inch motor\] is probably a little too big to be able to serve the purposes of HALO,”* LoPresti said. *“Are they potentially considering solid rocket motors? Absolutely. I certainly believe they are considering it.”*

*Naval News* understands that in a surface or air-launch capability, Northrop Grumman’s 21-inch motor delivers roughly twice the range and twice the height of legacy 14-inch motors. with a much higher burnout speed included.

With the [SM-6 Block IB program under review](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2025/07/another-u-s-navy-hypersonic-program-halted-in-strategic-pause/) in a ‘strategic pause’, LoPresti could not comment on the U.S. Navy’s intentions or plans for the program’s future. Questions were deferred to the service regarding program intentions and current progress.

The Department of the Navy has worked to re-evaluate its hypersonic weapons portfolio with lower cost systems that can be fielded in larger numbers. HALO’s exquisite design resulted in extremely high costs for development, including additional research into hydrocarbons that can detonate in the short length of the missile’s scramjet or ramjet motor. Since then, the U.S. Navy has pivoted toward systems that use solid rocket motors.

Candidates for OASuW Increment 2 are now weapons like the [Advanced Capacity Maritime Effector (ACME)](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2025/08/u-s-navy-bqm-34-ramjet-tests-supporting-an-internal-development-program-for-future-high-speed-missiles/), which explicitly mentions investment into new propulsion methods for time sensitive strike, aiming for rapid development. ACME FNC lists goals for an engineering and manufacturing development phase in FY2030 and early operational capability in FY2031.

China Lake’s internally developed Capacity High-Altitude Integrated Naval Strike Weapon (CHAINSAW), a testbed missile used to test ramjet propulsion, is another option for a future OASuW 2.0 missile. [The U.S. Navy tested CHAINSAW on a BQM-34 target drone last year](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2025/08/u-s-navy-bqm-34-ramjet-tests-supporting-an-internal-development-program-for-future-high-speed-missiles/).

Lockheed Martin has its internally developed Mako as a potential OASuW 2.0 weapon candidate, [which it unveiled at Sea Air Space 2024 after seven years of internal research and development](https://www.navalnews.com/event-news/sea-air-space-2024/2024/04/lockheed-martin-unveils-mako-hypersonic-missile/).

The U.S. Navy is evaluating multiple options all capable of being rapidly fielded in the coming years.

# Jan. 29th, 2026~Lockheed announces $1bn investment to ‘double-down’ on improving F-35’s operational readiness

[Lockheed announces $1bn investment to 'double-down' on improving F-35's operational readiness | Flight Global](https://www.flightglobal.com/defence/lockheed-announces-1bn-investment-to-double-down-on-improving-f-35s-operational-readiness/166122.article)

[Source: US Air ForceLockheed is targeting funds towards boosting the F-35’s mission-capable rate](https://preview.redd.it/jlciryhrhogg1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=50835621b78ed2cb91dc7c36dfd123f166f52401)

Lockheed Martin will spend more of its own money this year to improve the delivery of sustainment services and boost operational readiness rates on the F-35 fighter, the US airframer’s chief executive says.

“Over a fair few prior years there was – in our opinion – some under-funding of spare parts and repair capacity,” CEO James Taiclet says.

“We have been striving to make up for some of that with internal investment,” he notes. “We have put a billion-plus \[dollars\] into spare parts and repairs already, but we are going to double-down on that, to make an extra effort to improve the mission-capable rate for the aircraft and make up for the unfortunate deficit that’s been created over the last four or five years.”

Speaking during the company’s annual results call with analysts on 29 January, Taiclet noted: “It does require investment, but we feel that we are going to get benefit both financially and operationally out of the performance of the aircraft.”

To value $1 billion, its renewed commitment will “improve mission-capable rates across the fleet”, he says. “This is an absolute priority, and one we are working closely with the \[US\] Department of War on.”

Additionally, “In 2026 we will make further investments in the programme… with a focus on making further progress on Block 4 capability improvements,” Taiclet says.

After delivering a record 191 F-35s last year – including examples which had been placed into storage pending delayed approval of a Technical Refresh 3 package of updates – Lockheed expects to hand over a reduced total of the fifth-generation fighters in 2026.

“We expect deliveries to be in line with the production rate this year,” says chief financial officer Evan Scott, with its annual output “holding steady” at 156 jets.

Lockheed also will make a further $1 billion investment towards preparing for future Block 4 capability updates to the F-35.

In all, the airframer secured contracts worth $15 billion against the F-35 programme in 2025, Taiclet says. That figure includes definitised deals for Lot 18 and 19 of production, sustainment agreements, and also amended commitments for work in lots 20 and 21.

[Soon.. The NioCorp\/NAMA\~ Feb. 2026 ScAl \(Scandium Aluminum\) Alloy reveal w\/Lockheed\/DoD for components & platforms will be unlocked! ](https://reddit.com/link/1qs1cac/video/qex0quf0iogg1/player)

Taiclet also touched on the classified aeronautics development project against which Lockheed announced a [**$950 million penalty charge**](https://www.flightglobal.com/fixed-wing/lockheed-takes-significant-losses-on-classified-aeronautics-programme/163890.article) in the second quarter of 2025.

“This is a very complex design and integration activity, and risks are going to remain over the next few years as we progress through more key phases of the programme – which is progressing well,” he says.

“Notably, there were no additional charges reported on this programme in the fourth quarter. We continue to proactively monitor and manage potential risk, with our highest level of executives personally involved,” he adds.

“We are very confident in it \[the programme\], and in the team we have on the field to execute it.”

Lockheed also is already spending its own funds to advance work on a Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) design.

“We are building our own prototype of the drone wingman, or CCA – on our own R&D budget – because we think we will have the best product and we will get the scale of orders \[needed\],” Taiclet says.

The company in September 2025 revealed work by its Skunk Works unit on a platform named [**Vectis**](https://www.flightglobal.com/fixed-wing/lockheed-martin-unveils-vectis-autonomous-collaborative-jet-for-f-35-teaming/164598.article), which it said will “seamlessly integrate” with fifth-generation platforms such as the F-35.

Lockheed missed out on the US Air Force’s first-increment CCA opportunity, which will be met by either Anduril Industries or General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, with a selection decision expected late this year. Along with multiple other US companies, Lockheed is eyeing the service’s follow-on requirements to field uncrewed fighters, along with a similar need from the US Navy.

Lockheed recorded sales of $75 billion in 2025, with an operating profit of $6.7 billion. It also saw the value of its order backlog rise for the fourth successive year, to sit at $194 billion at year-end.

# Washington Just Picked Its Winners — And NioCorp Is Lining Up at the Starting Gate!

The U.S. government didn’t just “support” rare earths this week — it **became a shareholder**. A $1.6B federal package into USA Rare Earth marks the largest single investment ever made into domestic rare-earth production, and it sends a clear message: America is done pretending the free market alone will solve supply-chain warfare. When Commerce takes a 10% equity stake, senior-secured debt, and warrants, that’s not charity — that’s industrial mobilization. And it establishes a precedent that matters far beyond one company.

Now layer in what else happened *this same week*. Lockheed Martin announced **another $1B of its own capital** to shore up F-35 readiness, spare parts, sustainment, and Block 4 upgrades — on top of a $194B backlog and $15B in recent F-35 contracts. At the same time, the Navy quietly revived the HALO hypersonic missile program with a renewed focus on scalable motors, extended range, and faster fielding. Translation: defense primes are spending real money again, hypersonics are back on the table, and **materials bottlenecks are now mission-critical problems**.

This is exactly where NioCorp enters the frame — and why the market is completely missing it at $5-6 a share. Elk Creek isn’t just a mine; it’s a **seven-critical-mineral platform** aligned with the same defense and industrial priorities Washington is now funding directly: **niobium (armor & superalloys), scandium (Sc-Al aerospace alloys), titanium & TiCl₄, and magnet-grade rare earths (Nd, Pr, Dy, Tb)**. Unlike single-lane rare-earth stories, NioCorp sits at the intersection of **airframes, hypersonics, naval systems, AM, and next-gen propulsion**.

The catalysts from **February through mid-2026 are not speculative — they’re scheduled**. Early February: dual-portal construction starts, moving Elk Creek from paper to physical reality. February 2026: the **Sc-Al alloy reveal** with Lockheed, NAMA, DoD-adjacent partners, IBC, Nanoscale, and Creative Engineers — proof that NioCorp isn’t selling oxide, it’s enabling *platforms and components*. March: the **final DFS**, the most important document in the company’s history, validating economics across all seven minerals and confirming vertical Sc-Al integration already being de-risked through collaboration.

[For 30 years, every aerospace, EV, and defense prime has said the same two things about scandium: “We can’t design Sc-Al alloys without a reliable U.S. supply,” and “We can’t build supply without committed alloy demand.” That deadlock froze the entire U.S. scandium industry — until now. NioCorp didn’t just talk it to death, it broke the loop by moving downstream into Sc-Al alloys, FEA-IP Revolutionary production methods, and real platforms meant to make actual stuff. And this is where Ecclestone’s take collapses under its own weight: hand-waving about “no market” while ignoring that markets don’t exist until someone builds the ecosystem is intellectual laziness, not analysis. NioCorp isn’t waiting for permission — it’s doing the one thing critics never model: committing capital, partners, and engineering to force demand into existence. That’s not hype — that’s how industries are born. Like TITANIUM in the 1950's!](https://reddit.com/link/1qs1cac/video/fvqs0bnpiogg1/player)

From there, the dominoes line up fast. A credible DFS opens the door to **offtakes, JVs, and anchor investors** — the same kind of private capital that followed USA Rare Earth once federal alignment was clear. ESIA progresses. EXIM financing moves toward final approval. The poison pill sunsets. Per Mark Smith’s guidance, **final FID lands mid-2026**, followed by groundbreaking — with production targeted for 2029. That’s not hope; that’s a build sequence.

The big picture is this: the government just proved it will write billion-dollar checks — and take equity — to secure critical materials tied to defense, AI, and advanced manufacturing. Lockheed just proved it will spend its own capital to ensure readiness and throughput. Hypersonics just came roaring back. In that environment, a vertically integrated U.S. source of scandium alloys, niobium, titanium, and magnet REEs doesn’t stay “optional” for long. If USA Rare Earth is the first domino, **NioCorp is the broader backbone** — and the next phase of repricing won’t be driven by sentiment, but by inevitability.

[\#NIOCORP\~ ""TRIPLE LINDE TUESDAY!"" \\\\CRUX INVESTOR VIDEO: NioCorp (NASDAQ:NB) - H1/26 Financing with Strong US Government Support : r/NIOCORP\_MINE](https://www.reddit.com/r/NIOCORP_MINE/comments/1qoqcvz/niocorp_triple_linde_tuesday_crux_investor_video/)

[Recording date: 26th January 2026](https://preview.redd.it/ujgxh2lwkogg1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=48c6005b07d476e281a945ec1b1e92f3654013c0)

Mark Smith has been unusually clear in recent RedChip and Crux discussions: **2026 is execution year**. Construction is moving, the dual-portal start is imminent, the DFS is the gating document that unlocks everything, and EXIM-backed project finance remains the intended path to FID — not theory, not aspiration, but sequencing. He’s emphasized that Elk Creek is no longer about “if,” but about **building in the right order**, de-risking each step, and letting the fundamentals speak. With scandium alloys already being worked on alongside defense partners, niobium and titanium markets well understood, and rare earth optionality expanding, Smith’s message is consistent: *once the DFS lands, the conversation changes*. 2026 is when NioCorp stops being debated and starts being built — and markets historically don’t wait for ribbon cuttings to reprice reality.

**This is why EXIM, DoD, and Tier-1 primes are in deep discussions —** they need a fully domestic, fully integrated producer, and NioCorp is already architected to deliver exactly that.

***This is how you rebuild U.S. materials sovereignty —*** not one metal at a time, but with a single project that brings SEVEN critical minerals into four critical defense mineral chains back onshore at once!

**When the dust settles, Elk Creek won’t be “a mine.” It will be a cornerstone of the U.S. national security ecosystem.** The U.S. is signaling it. EXIM just confirmed it. And the global critical-mineral bottleneck is about to meet its first American challenger in decades.

Hi everyone!

I could really use some advice on how to navigate this situation because I feel completely confused

So, I (28F) have been together with my boyfriend (29M) for six years. Our relationship is genuinely good, we communicate well, we support each other, and overall I’ve felt like I’m living a very happy life with him. Recently, due to work, he’s been traveling a lot. Before this, we had never been apart for more than two weeks at a time.

During this time spent alone, something changed in me. I’ve felt incredibly free, like something heavy lifted off of me. I feel like I’ve rediscovered parts of myself. Now it feels like I was holding myself back, not because he was doing anything wrong, but somehow I lost myself along the way

What’s confusing is that I don’t really feel like I want him back yet. I wish I could extend these weeks alone. He’s coming home in a few days, and I hate admitting this, but I’m kind of dreading it.

There’s another layer to all of this: during this time, I think I finally admitted to myself that I have feelings for one of my friends. I probably had feelings for them for a long time, but I never really allowed myself to think of it as more than friendship. Over the past few weeks, though, I’ve felt like a teenager again…. thinking about them all the time, feeling excited when I get a text or when we meet for coffee, replaying conversations in my head….

All of this exists purely in my head. Nothing has happened between us. I’ve never cheated, I haven’t told them how I feel, and I honestly don’t even know if they feel anything for me. But in my imagination, I keep thinking about a life with them.

I don’t know what to do with these feelings. I don’t know if I should take this crush seriously, or if it’s just an escape, something exciting and new because I’ve had space and because I’m rediscovering myself. I haven’t felt butterflies like this in years.

I don’t want to leave my boyfriend, and I do think I’m happy with the life we’ve created, but all of this has left me feeling incredibly confused. At the same time, my thoughts and dreams keep pulling me toward this fantasy, and I don’t know how much meaning to give it.

Has anyone experienced something like this? How do you tell the difference between a real sign that something needs to change and just a temporary crush or escape fantasy?

Struggling to *think straight* is frustrating. You start a sentence and forget where it’s going. Your focus disappears like socks in the dryer. Coffee? Tried it. Meditation? Snoozed through it.

Many wish to know **how to improve concentration naturally**—without frying their nervous system. It’s more than a productivity issue; it wears on your mood, your sleep, even your confidence.

Rafael, a freelance video editor I know, found himself there too—editing timelines while his brain was buffering. He [tried SynaBoost](https://theworldhealth.org/synaboost-official), and after hearing his experience, I gave it the once-over. Here's what I found.

# 📦 Product Overview

**Product Name:** SynaBoost  
**Category:** Health & Wellness 🡆 Brain & Cognitive Support  
**Overall Verdict:** 4.7/5

============

>

============

# 💡 What Is SynaBoost?

**SynaBoost** is a daily capsule aimed at helping you think clearer, remember better, and get through your workday without drifting into outer space.

It contains **plant-based brain boosters** like **Rhodiola Rosea**, **Bacopa Monnieri**, and **Huperzia Serrata**, all pulled from herbal traditions and modern studies.

It also skips stimulants. This makes it one of the few **nootropics without caffeine** that still gives you a mental boost—without shaking hands or heart palpitations.

# 🧑‍💻 My Personal Experience with SynaBoost (Told by Rafael)

Rafael’s a freelance video editor who juggles deadlines, coffee cups, and way too many browser tabs.

He spends hours in front of a screen trimming footage, syncing audio, and fixing awkward jump cuts—so staying mentally sharp is kind of a non-negotiable.

Here’s what he told me:

>

I took one capsule in the morning with breakfast.

By day three, I noticed I was moving through edits faster and catching little details without zoning out. It didn’t hit me like caffeine—it was more like someone dimmed the noise in my head so I could think clearly. That was new.

>

I still drink coffee, but now I don’t *need* it just to function.""

Rafael said he’s planning to grab the 3-bottle pack next round. Safe to say the experiment was a success.

# 🌿 Ingredients Breakdown & How It Works

This stuff isn’t sprinkled with unicorn dust—it’s made with actual plants that have brain-related benefits backed by decades of research.

The stars of the show are **Bacopa Monnieri** and **Rhodiola Rosea**, two heavyweights in the category of **herbal supplements for mental clarity and cognitive support**.

Bacopa is known for supporting memory formation, and Rhodiola is often used in **holistic remedies for mental fatigue**. Together, they help maintain focus without frying your circuits.

**Huperzia Serrata**, another key component, is used in **natural cognitive enhancers** for supporting neurotransmitter function.

These ingredients are often listed as the **best herbs for cognitive function**, and the synergy here gives the formula some real traction.

If you're looking for **supplements for mental clarity and energy** that don’t include synthetic nonsense, this formula makes a strong case.

The fact that it’s one of the **supplements** for **focus without stimulants** also means no afternoon crashes or sleepless nights.

That earns it a spot among **safe and effective herbal nootropics for daily use**, at least in my book.

# 🧠 Effectiveness for Focus, Memory & Mental Clarity

So, how does it actually feel in real life? I noticed the benefits most during [deep work tasks](https://theworldhealth.org/synaboost-official)—writing, editing, and powering through spreadsheets without 12 browser tab detours.

1qs190o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qs190o,12 days in the mountains of Málaga,"Loosely following the bikepacking route Mälaka Bike Experience (https://malakabikexperience.es/en/), I ​had my first go at biking in mountains when doing this loop around the beautiful region of Málaga, Spain, this January. The route is designed and maintained by Sergio, the owner of Mälaka Bikes, a bicycle shop in Málaga where the route officially starts and ends - an extremely kind and helpful guy. Coming from Denmark, a very flat country, the mountains sure was a tough experience for ​my legs but definitely well worth it. It was also my first bike tour in a foreign country so I probably overpacked a bit too. 

I went with a touring setup: Genesis Tour de Fer 10 with 40 mm tyres + 4 panniers. I had bought the bike just before Christmas and only had had time to ride it exactly once before leaving and that was from the store to my home, a 4 km ride. Then due to an exam and lots of snow I just didn't get the chance to ​take it for a spin before having to absolutely decimate my shiny, new, noble metal steed, taking much more apart than I had planned in order to fit everything in a smaller-than-expected cardboard box and fly it and myself to Spain. ​

The route is designed for bikepacking and is probably best done with a lighter setup than mine, but going slow and resting at hostels every third day worked fine for me. Once out of the city of Málaga, ​the route follows a mix of asphalt and gravel (like 70/30 I'd say, but I diverged on several sections so not entirely sure​). What has been said on this subreddit before was fortunately true: Spanish drivers are very respectful of bicycles ​and they adhere to the rule of keeping a 1.5m distance. ​The further into the mountains I got the fewer cars were there and it was a bliss pedaling on the paved roads while watching the majestic mountains slowly passing by. Dramatic cliffs and olive trees define the first half of the route. In January the orange trees are bulging with fruits and are ​seen in along the streets of every pueblo you pass through. Such a joy to munch, too. Coffee is cheap and very good. Iberian ham, fresh olives (best I've ever had) and cheese from the market kept me going. 

About halfway through the route you reach the town of Ronda, built upon two gnarly cliffs that stand 98 meters tall that are joined by a beautiful 1793 bridge. I was re-listening to Game of Thrones while biking and felt that I had discovered a real-world ​The Wall (which is 700 feet / 213 meter tall). So imposing and awesome. 

After Ronda the route takes you close to a couple of caves. I took a small detour to reach Cueva de la Pileta, known for its cave paintings (a childhood dream of mine). This was the highlight in terms of points of interest for me. The cave has incredible geology and is filled with paintings left behind by our distant ancestors. Pay attention to that crudely drawn yellow horse on one of the images. It is 32k years old!! 

From here the routes is marked by quiet mountain roads, mostly paved. I got into the rhythm of just pedaling and watching the surroundings for some days. One day I reached the pueblo Pujerra. Here, the friendly locals warned me about proceeding to Sierra de las Nieves (the mountains of snow) because the area was apparently really living up to its name. It was also going to be a lot of gravel and uphill stuff, and as it was already cold enough and I was pretty exhausted at this point, I opted to skip this national park. Sad, as I think it is probably very beautiful, but I am happy I did. 

After some hours I reached a road that led back to the coast. It started nearly 1100 meters above sea level. 23 km later you were at the sea. Extremely satisfying downhill exit from the mountains to San Pedro de Alcántara. After that I made a deliberately slow return to Málaga going by the coast. Definitely much too touristy, but going along the sea was good. 

I slept in a tent when I was not paying for hostels. Stealth camping is a necessity, and I was missing the cozy primitive camping spots you find everywhere in Scandinavia, but I woke up to some scenic vistas and generally felt very safe. It was apparently a cold January with temperatures dropping to 0c, so I was happy to have brought my winter sleeping bag. 

I must confess that I was a little disappointed with the lack of friendliness from the locals. With a few very notable exceptions (shout-out to Sergio, the people of Pujerra, Jubrique and ​others!), I was surprised by how uninterested most people I tried to speak with were. I speak Spanish pretty well and am an outgoing, smiling person but I only rarely found anyone of the locals to chat with. Other travelers and people from Argentina, Venezuela, Germany etc were as pleasant as ever, but not the Spaniards in my experience, alas. I love traveling solo and interacting with locals, but I didn't get to do that as much as I had hoped on this trip. Had it not been winter, it definitely could be that it might have been a different story. 

Thanks to these subreddits, I felt very well equipped to tackle this adventure. Such an amazing resource to have!

I’m currently looking for a new espresso machine for my home setup.
At the moment I’m using a DeLonghi Dedica. While I’m actually very happy with the espresso it produces, visually and in terms of build quality it’s just not what I’m looking for.
I’ve visited several coffee shops and retailers in my area, and almost all of them recommended the ECM Synchronika II. However, at around €3,100 it’s simply outside my budget right now. In the long run, that will probably be the machine I end up with, but for now I’m looking for a more affordable upgrade to get to know larger, more serious machines.
I completely fell in love with the Rocket Appartamento TCA — unfortunately mostly for its looks. From what I’ve heard, it’s apparently not that great technically and can be problematic in terms of maintenance, as I’ve come across quite a bit of negative feedback.
So I wanted to ask: what machines would you recommend up to around €1,500? And what do you think about buying used machines — is the risk too high, or is it worth considering?
I drink about 4–5 cappuccinos a day. Heat-up time isn’t a big concern for me since smart plugs are an option. Visually, I really like traditional (modern-classic) designs, like the Appartamento for example.",6,1769862956.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

""You all stopped being my family five years ago. When you shipped me to another country. Changed my name. Exiled me."" 
The girl they abandoned is dust. What stands before them now does not bend. Does not beg. Does not forget. And she's only just started collecting what they owe her.
______________

Gianna Pov
My family sucks.
At this point, I don't know why I ever let myself have even the smallest shred of hope that they might change.
It's been like this for five years now.
Ever since they wrote me off. Believed a lie because it was easier than believing me.
Pricks.
My life really is like a Disney movie-if you strip out all the magic and replace it with trauma.
I'm the fat, ugly duckling with an evil twin sister. Cast aside. Exiled. Sent away to live in a tower.
Except it's not a tower.
It's a strict-as-sin all-girls reform school in the middle of Germany.
And somehow? I run this bimbo.
There's no loving family waiting for my safe return. No lanterns lighting the way home like Rapunzel. Just a family that wishes I were dead.
And honestly? The feeling's mutual.
Because when that tiny seed of hope gets shoved down-way, way, way deep-all that's left is hatred.
If this were really a Disney movie, I would've been rescued by now. Swept away by some hot prince with a thick accent and a savior complex.
But I'm not a damsel.
And I don't need saving.
All I need... is me.
The one time in the last five years I let myself trust someone, he did exactly what everyone else in my miserable life has done.
He left me broken.
Never again.
The blankets rustle as I pull them tighter around my shoulders, curling deeper into bed as the digital clock glows in the darkness of my cell-
I mean... tower.
Room.
12:02 a.m.
It's officially my seventeenth birthday.
And my father couldn't even be bothered to call.
I know, I know-you're probably thinking relax, you crazy bimbo, it's only two minutes past midnight.
But back when I still had a family-back when I was stupid enough to believe I mattered-my father never missed it. Not once.
Every year, without fail, he'd come into my sister's and my shared bedroom... or call right at twelve on the dot. Just so he could be the first to say it.
Happy birthday.
""Happy birthday to me,"" I whisper, crushing every emotion that tries to claw its way to the surface.
Five years.
No phone calls.
No holidays.
No birthdays.
No visits.
Nothing.
They don't deserve a place in my life.
And they sure as sin don't deserve a place in my heart.
They wouldn't recognize me now-even if they tried.
Rolling onto my side, I force myself to breathe in... and out.
Just like he taught me.
Then I let the nightmares take me
*
The sound of violent banging rips me out of sleep.
I jerk, heart racing, eyes struggling to focus as pale morning light spills through the tall, narrow windows of my room. For a second, I don't know where I am-or who I'm supposed to be today.
Then reality slams back into place.
""What time is it...?""
I squint at the digital clock glowing on my nightstand.
10:00.
""Oh-shiit.""
I bolt upright.
""Sh.it, sh.it, sh.it.""
I forgot to turn on my alarm.
They are going to kill me.
I'm out of bed in seconds, dragging open drawers, yanking on the stiff gray uniform skirt and blouse the school insists we wear on transport days. I barely bother buttoning it properly, hands shaking as I shove my feet into shoes.
At the last second, I grab my bag and stuff a pair of worn jeans and a black top inside.
I'm not spending the entire day dressed like a sanctioned ghost.
I rake my fingers through my hair, not even pretending to tame it, and fling my door open-
-and narrowly avoid getting punched in the face.
Annalese freezes mid-swing, eyes wide. ""sorry, Gia!""
""Come on!"" I snap, grabbing her wrist before she can even apologize again.
I drag her down the narrow spiral staircase of my tower, boots pounding against stone steps worn smooth by years of isolation and punishment masquerading as concern.
Yes. A tower.
I wasn't being dramatic last night.
Apparently, my family-and the administration-decided I'm too unstable to live with the other girls. Easier to keep me separate. Easier to keep me quiet. Easier to pretend I'm not here.
We take the stairs two at a time, nearly tripping as we burst onto the main landing and sprint toward the front of the school.
""NO RUNNING!"" the janitor shouts after us, shaking her mop like it's a weapon.
We don't even slow down.
I nearly double over laughing when I spot Isa at the transport doors, bent in half, clutching her stomach like she's in the middle of a medical emergency.
She's committed. I'll give her that.
""Miss Valen,"" the driver says flatly, arms crossed. ""We need to leave. Either get on the bus or go to medical.""
""Y-yeah, I will,"" Isa groans dramatically. ""I just-ahhh-oh my God-""
She squeezes her eyes shut, swaying.
Then she peeks between her lashes, spots us flying toward her from the left, and straightens instantly.
""Oh! Wow,"" she says, brushing imaginary dust off her skirt. ""Must've been the last cramp. I feel so much better.""
The driver just sighs, clearly aware but choosing peace, as Annalese and I pile onto the bus behind her, breathless, laughing, and barely avoiding consequences-again.
We collapse into the back row of the transport bus like we've just escaped a war zone.
Isa drops into the seat first, cheeks flushed, arms crossed tight over her chest. Annalese slides in beside her, smoothing her skirt, still breathing a little too fast. I take the window, clutching my bag like it's the only thing tethering me to sanity.
The doors hiss shut.
The bus lurches forward.
Only then does Isa groan and drag her hands down her face.
""I cannot believe I just did that.""
I snort. ""You were convincing.""
She shoots me a glare. ""I faked period cramps in front of a grown adult with a clipboard, Gia. That's a new low.""
Annalese laughs softly. ""You did save us, though.""
Isa sighs, shoulders slumping. ""Yeah, well. Still humiliating.""
The bus rattles as the gates slide open, the stone walls of the school slowly falling away behind us. I lean my forehead against the cool glass, watching the towers disappear.
Once a week.
That's all we get.
One transport out. One transport back.
Miss the bus going out? Too bad-there's always next week.
Miss the one coming back?
You lose the privilege entirely.
It took me two years before they let me leave.
Two years of ""good behavior.""
Two years of no incidents.
I was a different girl then.
""So,"" Annalese says gently, breaking the silence. ""We still going to Steiger's ?""
I turn, a slow smile curling at the corner of my mouth. ""Of course.""
Isa rolls her eyes. ""Of course.""
""I've got training,"" I add casually. ""And Jonas texted me last night ago, jonas said I have a fight on the books at three.
""Isa groans. ""You are unhinged.""
Annalese bites her lip, worried. ""Do you have to?""
I glance at her, softening. ""I don't have to. I want to.""
Steiger's isn't just a place-it's survival.
It's a local fight venue tucked beneath an old warehouse, the kind of place people from the underworld gravitate toward when they're in town. No cameras. No questions. Cash only.
The first time I came here, I was fifteen.
Unhealthy. Weak. Angry.
Part of it was depression.
The other part?
I really, really love food-and eating my feelings.
I'd wandered too far from the market, distracted, tired. Cornered. Two men. I didn't know how to fight. Didn't know how to scream loud enough.
Jonas-the owner-and his son, Henry, stepped in before it got worse.
After that, once a week, I was there.
Training. Fighting. Learning discipline.
They gave me structure.
A routine I could keep-even back at the school.
And slowly... everything changed.
Mentally.
Physically.
Emotionally.
Mostly.
Annalese glances at my bag. ""Are we changing before we get there?""
I smirk, tapping it with my foot. ""Of course. I am not walking around the village looking like a haunted schoolgirl all day.""
Isa snorts despite herself. ""Good. Because you look like a ghost that escaped a convent.""
The bus hums beneath us, carrying us farther from the school, closer to freedom.
Just for today.
*
The bus slows as the road narrows, cobblestone rattling beneath the tires.
The village comes into view like something stolen from a postcard-stone buildings clustered together, narrow streets, little shops just waking up. A bakery with its windows fogged from heat. A cafe dragging chairs outside. Normal life.
Freedom.
The bus hisses as it comes to a stop in the small gravel lot just outside the village center.
No one moves.
We all know better.
The aisle creaks as Frau Keller stands.
A collective, silent groan ripples through the bus.
She's tall, stiff-backed, dressed in gray like she was born offended by color. Her lips press together as she surveys us, eyes sharp and disapproving-like she already knows we're planning crimes.
She hates us.
We hate her.
It's mutual. Efficient.
""Before anyone exits,"" she says sharply, her accent slicing through the bus, ""we will go over the rules. Again.""
Isa mutters under her breath, ""Thrilling.""
I elbow her lightly.
Frau Keller's gaze snaps in our direction, but she continues.
""You are here on privilege, not right. One day. One outing."" She lifts a finger. ""You will stay within the village boundaries. You will not enter restricted establishments. You will not start fights, steal, disappear, or embarrass this institution.""
Her eyes linger on me for half a second too long.
Shocker.
""You will return to this bus by 6 o'clock sharp,"" she continues. ""Not six -oh-one. Not six-oh-two. Late arrivals will lose village privileges indefinitely.""
A pause.
""If you miss the return transport,"" she says coolly, ""you will not be allowed to leave again. Ever.""
The air tightens.
Everyone here knows that rule.
It took me two years before I was trusted enough to sit on this bus. Two years of swallowed rage. Of silence. Of proving I wasn't the girl they decided I was.
I was a different girl then.
Frau Keller folds her hands. ""You will be searched upon return. Any contraband will result in punishment.""
She steps aside and gestures toward the door.
""You may go.""
For a split second, no one moves.
Then the doors open with a hydraulic sigh, and the spell breaks.
Girls pour out in clusters, laughter bursting free the moment their feet hit the ground. Voices rise. Shoulders straighten. Smiles bloom like they've been starved for sunlight.
Annalese exhales, almost reverent. ""I forgot how good it smells out here.""
Isa cracks her neck. ""That's called freedom.""
I step down last, the village air cool against my skin, my bag slung over my shoulder-jeans and a black top waiting inside like a promise.
Frau Keller watches us from the bus steps, arms crossed, eyes already counting the hours until she gets us back.
I don't look at her.
I look forward.
My knuckles already tingling with anticipation, today of all days I need a release.
*
Steiger's sits at the edge of the village where the streets narrow and the buildings lean closer together, brick darkened by age and secrets. No sign. No windows. Just a heavy metal door tucked beneath a faded warehouse awning like it doesn't want to be found.
The kind of place you only notice if you're looking for it.
Annalese slows beside me, fingers tightening around the strap of her bag.
""This is where I peel off,"" she says quietly.
Isa snorts. ""You sure? You could watch Gia rearrange someone's face.""
Annalese wrinkles her nose, though she smiles. ""I'll pass. It's... loud. And rough. And it smells like blood and regret.""
I smirk. ""That's part of the charm.""
She bumps her shoulder lightly against mine. ""I know it is. Just not for me.""
Her gaze flicks to the door-steel, scarred, uninviting-then back to me, worry softening her eyes. ""You'll be careful?""
""Always,"" I say automatically.
She doesn't look convinced.
""There's a little bookstore near the square,"" she adds. ""The one with the blue shutters. I want to check if they have anything in English.""
""Of course you do,"" Isa says, rolling her eyes fondly. ""Text us if you find something depressing.""
Annalese laughs. ""I will.""
She hesitates, then steps forward and wraps her arms around me in a quick, tight hug. She smells like soap and paper and something gentle that doesn't belong near places like this.
""Seven o'clock,"" she reminds me softly. ""Don't be late.""
""I won't,"" I promise.
She pulls back, gives Isa a small wave, then turns and heads back toward the brighter streets of the village, her figure slowly swallowed by sunlight and quiet.
Isa watches her go, then clicks her tongue. ""Smart one, that girl.""
""She is,"" I agree.
Isa grins at me, sharp and unapologetic. ""Ready to make bad decisions?""
I glance at the door.
At the place that saved me.
""Always.""
I knock once.
The door swings open, and the noise hits like a punch-music, shouts, metal on metal, the roar of bodies colliding. Heat. Sweat. Electricity.
And just like that...
I'm home.

Alessia Pov
Sunlight spills through the sheer curtains, warm and indulgent, brushing over silk sheets and expensive furniture like it knows exactly where it belongs.
I stretch slowly, luxuriating in the space around me.
My room is beautiful-high ceilings, pale walls, a crystal chandelier that catches the light just right. Everything curated. Everything perfect. Just like it should be.
I smile to myself as I sit up.
It's my birthday.
Seventeen.
The thought makes a soft laugh slip from my lips. Excited? Of course I am. The entire day will be about me-gifts, attention, admiration.
Then again... when isn't it?
""Please,"" I murmur to my reflection in the darkened window. ""Every day is about me.""
I slide out of bed and move toward the bathroom, bare feet sinking into plush carpet. My routine is practiced, flawless-cleansed skin, soft makeup, just enough to look effortless while still being devastating.
When I return to my room, I choose the dress I laid out the night before. Short. Structured. Preppy in the way that makes people think good girl when they should know better. Heels click softly as I step into them, grounding me.
I stop in front of the mirror.
Perfect.
My hair falls in loose waves down my back, my waist narrow, my legs long and toned. I turn slightly, inspecting every angle, every line. There's satisfaction there-deep and unquestioned.
This is what they see.
This is what they chose.
My smile sharpens as an unwanted thought flickers through my mind.
My twin.
The corner of my mouth twitches.
God, it's almost funny.
I picture her the way she was the last time I saw her-soft, round, always taking up too much space. Always eating. Always looking like she wanted something she couldn't have.
The fat sister.
The embarrassing one.
The one who ruined everything just by existing.
I tilt my head, studying my reflection again, reassured by the contrast. By the distance. By how thoroughly that chapter of my life has been erased.
She's gone.
And I'm still here.
I smooth my dress, lift my chin, and smile at myself-wide, bright, practiced.
Seventeen looks good on me.
I hear them before I see them.
Voices drift up the hall as I move toward the dining room, overlapping, amused, competitive.
""I'm telling you, she'll like mine more.""
""You bought her jewelry again. She already has too much.""
""She doesn't have this.""
I slow my steps just outside the doorway, smiling to myself.
Of course they're arguing.
Every year, it's the same-my brothers circling, posturing, desperate to be the one who pleases me most. Gifts wrapped perfectly. Attention lavished freely.
They've always been like this.
Wrapped around my finger.
Every single one of them.
Even my father.
I step into the room.
The argument stops instantly.
Six heads turn. Smiles spread. Chairs shift. The energy changes, bending toward me like gravity has rules only I get to break.
""There she is,"" Marco says, grinning. ""Birthday girl.""
""Finally decided to join us,"" Enzo adds. ""We were about to start without you.""
I laugh lightly, letting the sound carry just enough sweetness. ""You wouldn't dare.""
My father sits at the head of the table, as he always does-posture immaculate, expression warm in a way he saves only for moments like this. He looks up when he sees me, pride unmistakable in his eyes.
""Buon compleanno, Alessia,"" he says. ""Seventeen.""
I walk toward him, heels clicking softly against marble, and lean down to ki.ss his cheek. ""Thank you, Papa.""
I feel it then-the familiar sense of triumph. Of safety. Of knowing exactly where I stand.
Loved. Chosen.
It had been almost too easy five years ago.
The lie, I mean.
I'd been close to Lorenzo then. Close enough to know how to shape it. Close enough to know what would sound believable. And really-who wouldn't believe me?
I'd been the good one. The perfect one. The daughter who never caused trouble.
The truth never stood a chance.
""Sit,"" my father says gently, gesturing toward my place. ""Breakfast first.""
A chorus of groans answers him.
""Presents,"" Nico protests. ""Come on, Papa.""
""Yes, presents,"" Elio adds. ""It's cruel to make her wait.""
My father lifts a brow, amused but firm. ""Breakfast. Then gifts. I want to watch you all behave like civilized men for at least ten minutes.""
They grumble but obey.
I take my seat, smoothing my dress, basking in the attention as plates are passed and coffee poured. My brothers watch me like I might disappear if they look away.
All of them-except one.
Lorenzo sits a few seats down, expression unreadable, posture rigid. He meets my gaze briefly.
""Happy birthday,"" he says.
Nothing more. No smile. No warmth.
Just obligation.
It annoys me more than it should.
He had been the closest to her once.
I look away first.
Food is served. Forks clink. Conversation resumes, light and loud and full of me.
Breakfast first.
Then presents.
And after that?
The rest of the day will unfold exactly as it always does.
Around me.

Salvatore POV
I sit at the head of the table and watch my children.
It's a habit I never quite broke-the assessment, the quiet tally of strengths and weaknesses, the constant calculation of what they are becoming. A Don does not simply raise sons. He forges them.
The dining room hums with noise. Cutlery against porcelain. Low laughter. Competing voices.
Lorenzo sits to my right, spine straight, expression unreadable. He eats methodically, eyes flicking up only when necessary. He is my heir in every way that matters-controlled, disciplined, sealed tight. Emotion has never ruled him.
It is also his greatest flaw.
Across from him, Marco leans back in his chair, broad shoulders tense even at rest. He speaks little, but when he does, the table quiets. He has always understood violence the way others understand language. Direct. Efficient. Loyal.
Alessandro, beside him, talks with his hands, already dissecting something only he can see-routes, numbers, probabilities. His mind moves faster than most men twice his age. Strategy is not something he learned. It is something he is.
The oldest three.
The pillars.
Then there is Vincenzo.
He laughs too loudly, fork abandoned in favor of gesturing wildly as he recounts something I already know involved broken knuckles and poor impulse control. Volatile. Dangerous. Useful, if pointed in the right direction.
I watch him carefully.
At the far end of the table sit the youngest.
Domenico leans forward, jaw tight, eyes sharp. He hates waiting. Hates being told no. Control matters to him-too much, perhaps-but that fire will either make him powerful or reckless. Time will decide.
Elio, beside him, says almost nothing. He eats quietly, gaze drifting-not unfocused, but watching. He sees everything. Always has. That kind of silence can be more dangerous than rage.
My sons.
My legacy.
And then there is Alessia.
She sits near the center, radiant, laughing easily as attention bends toward her without effort. Every movement is practiced, every smile perfectly placed. She has always known how to be adored.
Seventeen today.
My chest tightens-just slightly-before I school my expression.
There is... an absence.
A familiar ache I pretend not to feel.
Another daughter should be sitting here.
The thought comes uninvited.
I press my fingers briefly against the edge of the table, grounding myself. It has been five years. The decision was made. Necessary. Final.
Still-
The pain lingers, sharp and unwelcome.
Before I can follow the thought further, the heavy doors at the far end of the dining room slam open.
Conversation dies instantly.
Every head snaps toward the sound.
A presence fills the room-cold, immense, undeniable.
My father stands in the doorway.
He has not set foot in this house in five years.
Not since the day we sent Gianna away.
His posture is rigid, his silver hair combed back with military precision, eyes dark and assessing as they sweep over the table. He does not smile.
He never did.
For a moment, no one moves. No one breathes.
I rise slowly from my chair.
""Padre,"" I say carefully.
His gaze locks onto mine, sharp as a blade.
I watch my father stand in the doorway like time itself decided to walk back into the house.
Age has not bent him. If anything, it has sharpened him-lines etched deep into his face, eyes still dark and commanding. He steps into the room without hesitation, and the air shifts immediately.
My sons rise to their feet.
One by one.
Lorenzo first, respectful and silent.
Marco next, shoulders squared.
Alessandro nods, already calculating.
Vincenzo straightens with barely contained energy.
Domenico stiffens, jaw tight.
Elio simply watches.
My father's gaze moves over them slowly.
Fondly.
He addresses each of them by name-asking after their training, their studies, their discipline. His voice is firm, but there is pride there. Approval.
It settles into my chest like a weight.
Then I notice who he does not acknowledge.
Alessia sits perfectly still, smile frozen, hands folded in her lap.
Ignored.
My jaw tightens.
I don't interrupt. I never have. Respect for my father is not optional-it is instinct. He built this empire long before I inherited it. His word still carries weight, whether I like it or not.
But the omission is deliberate.
And it angers me.
Because Alessia is my daughter.
Because today is her birthday.
Because seventeen is not just another year for a woman born into the De Santis family.
Seventeen is when a daughter is revealed.
The public acknowledgment.
The formal presentation.
The declaration of lineage.
A princess, unveiled to the world.
My father turns his attention to me at last.
""Seventeen,"" he says. ""A significant age.""
""Yes,"" I reply evenly. ""It is.""
He studies me for a long moment, eyes narrowing-not in accusation, but in assessment. The way he's always looked at me when he suspects weakness.
""I will not attend the public announcement,"" he says calmly.
The words land like a blade across the table.
The room goes utterly still.
I rise slowly from my chair. ""Padre-""
""I will not endorse her,"" he repeats, voice unyielding. ""Not publicly. Not privately.""
Alessia's breath catches. I see it out of the corner of my eye.
My chest tightens.
""That is your granddaughter,"" I say carefully, forcing control into every syllable.
My father's gaze does not waver.
""And so is Gianna.""
The name hits me harder than I expect.
Gianna.
I see it again-blood on the marble floor. Her hands shaking. The knife. Her eyes wide, terrified, broken.
I wasn't there.
I didn't see it happen.
But I saw enough.
Or so I told myself.
""I will not celebrate one granddaughter while the other remains erased,"" my father continues. ""Bring Gianna home, Salvatore. Or there will be no presentation. No blessing. No De Santis acknowledgment.""
The silence stretches, thick and suffocating.
Around the table, my sons say nothing.
And Alessia-
She does not move.
I straighten fully, meeting my father's stare head-on.
""This is not the place,"" I say quietly.
""No,"" he agrees. ""But it is the time.""
He turns away from the table, already dismissing the moment as settled.
I remain standing long after he leaves the room.
Seventeen is a big year for De Santis daughters.
And suddenly, the future I thought was certain no longer is.
The silence doesn't last.
Domenico is the first to break it.
He pushes back from the table, chair legs scraping harshly against the marble floor. His jaw is tight, hands clenched like he's already halfway to violence.
""Nonno can't really do that,"" he snaps. ""Can he?""
His eyes cut to me, furious. Demanding.
I lean back slowly in my chair, folding my hands together, forcing myself to breathe.
My father does not bluff.
When he says something, the world adjusts around it.
""He can,"" I say evenly.
Domenico scoffs. ""That's bullshiit. This is Alessia's year. Seventeen-it's tradition.""
""It is,"" I agree.
My gaze drifts, unbidden, to the empty chair.
For the first time in years, I allow myself to think the thought I have buried under duty and certainty and blood.
Maybe.
Maybe Gianna has changed.
Five years is a long time.
Maybe she worked through whatever jealousy poisoned her. Whatever resentment drove her to do what she did. Maybe distance hardened her. Maybe discipline fixed what love could not.
Maybe bringing her home would not be a mistake.
The idea settles uncomfortably in my chest.
Alessia's breath stutters.
I turn just in time to see her eyes shine, tears gathering but not falling-carefully held, perfectly restrained. She rises slowly from her chair, hands trembling just enough to be seen.
""Papa,"" she says, voice soft but breaking at the edges. ""That announcement is my birthright.""
The word birthright echoes through the room.
She takes a step toward me.
""I didn't do anything wrong,"" she continues, tears finally spilling over, sliding down her cheeks like glass. ""I've been everything you asked me to be. Everything this family needs.""
My sons watch her closely.
Marco's jaw tightens.
Vincenzo looks like he might explode.
Alessandro's eyes flick between us, already running outcomes.
Elio says nothing-but he misses nothing.
Lorenzo remains still, his face unreadable.
Domenico bristles beside her. ""She's right.""
Alessia reaches for my hand, gripping it tightly. ""Please,"" she whispers. ""You can't let him take this from me.""
I look down at my daughter.
At the girl I raised.
The girl I believed.
The girl who stood before me five years ago, shaking and terrified, telling a story soaked in blood.
And for the first time-
I am not certain.
I gently pull my hand from hers.
""No one is taking anything from you,"" I say carefully.
Her eyes widen-not in relief, but in fear.
""But,"" I continue, ""until this is resolved... nothing will be announced.""
Her breath catches sharply.
The word resolved hangs between us like a threat.
Somewhere deep inside me, something shifts.
Because for the first time since the night Gianna left-
I am considering bringing her home.
""Hey.""
Elio's voice cuts through the room, louder than anyone expects from him.
All eyes shift to the far end of the table.
He leans back in his chair, one arm draped casually over the backrest, expression easy-almost careless. The watcher choosing, deliberately, to become the distraction.
""Why don't we just finish breakfast,"" he says lightly, flashing a grin in Alessia's direction, ""and then open all your presents?""
A few heads turn. The tension eases-just a fraction.
""That'll make it a little better,"" Elio continues, standing now, clapping his hands once. ""We'll figure everything else out, okay?""
He walks closer to Alessia, resting a hand briefly on her shoulder.
""Today is about you.""
It works.
I see it the moment her shoulders relax. The way her breathing evens. The tears stop falling-not wiped away, but mastered. Controlled. She nods slowly, swallowing hard.
""Yes,"" she says softly. ""Okay.""
Around the table, my sons take the cue.
Marco exhales through his nose.
Vincenzo mutters something about food getting cold.
Domenico settles back into his chair, still seething but quiet-for now.
Alessandro picks up his fork, already filing the moment away for later.
Breakfast resumes.
Plates clink. Coffee is poured. Conversation restarts in careful, rehearsed tones.
But the damage has been done.
I cut a piece of fruit and lift my gaze-just briefly.
Lorenzo is already watching me.
Our eyes meet.
There is no accusation there. No challenge.
Only understanding.
This is not the end of the conversation.
Not today.
Not ever.
And as I look back down at my plate, the thought returns-unwelcome, persistent.
Gianna.
For the first time in five years, her name is no longer buried.
It is waiting.
And soon... it will demand answers.",1,1769862779.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Going out if it's too sunny, windy, or cold makes my eyes shrink and I can barely keep them open. Now I can't wear sunglasses all the time either indoors, but surprisngly what helped me were blue light glasses, or as I call them: fake glasses haha. I don't believe they actually filter out bluelight for 7 dollars, but for some reason they help my eyes a lot!! I think it might be that they block the wind hitting my eyes directly? Not sure but super helpful. 

Here are some other small things that helped me, please add on in the coments what helped you!

- Headphones/earphones (ofc)
- Comfort hoodie + oversized t-shirts
- Wearing socks 24/7 
- Fingerless gloves 
- Scented candles, incense burners and candles in general for low lights 
- Ambient soothing noise (meditation playlists or even soothing affirmations) in the background 
- Drinking hot water (instead of coffee. It hits the same!) 
- I've put a small heater near my bed for extra comfort 
- A simple silver ring I can fidget with + a beaded braclet like monks have which I can take off and count the beads for calmness

The truth is, women communicate interest differently than we expect. We're looking for some grand Hollywood gesture when they're dropping breadcrumbs we keep stepping over. After diving deep into behavioral psychology and relationship research (plus honestly, just paying better attention), I've noticed patterns that keep showing up. These aren't the obvious ones everyone talks about. These are the small things that actually matter.

## She remembers weird details about your life

This isn't just ""oh she remembered my birthday."" I'm talking about the offhand comment you made three weeks ago about your favorite childhood snack, or that random band you mentioned liking once. When someone's genuinely interested, their brain latches onto these details without even trying.

Dr. John Gottman's research on relationships shows that people who are romantically interested naturally prioritize information about their person of interest. Your brain literally codes memories differently when there's attraction involved. So when she brings up something you barely remember telling her? That's not just good listening skills.

The Attachment Project is actually a solid app for understanding relationship dynamics if you want to dig deeper into this stuff. It breaks down communication patterns and helps you recognize when someone's actually invested versus just being polite. The psychology behind it is fascinating, shows you how small behaviors reveal deeper interest levels.

## She finds excuses to extend conversations

Pay attention to this one because it's huge. The conversation has naturally ended. There's a clear exit point. But she keeps it going with random questions or ""oh wait, one more thing.""

She's not just being chatty. Research from evolutionary psychologist Dr. David Buss shows that women invest more time in conversations with potential partners they're screening. It's subconscious risk assessment mixed with genuine desire to keep you around longer.

Notice if she asks follow up questions that have nothing to do with the original topic. Or if she randomly texts you something hours after you last spoke. That's her brain literally searching for reasons to maintain contact.

## Her friends suddenly know who you are

This is wildly underrated as a signal. You meet her friends and they immediately recognize your name. They know details about you. Maybe they give her knowing looks.

When a woman talks about you to her inner circle, that's significant social investment. According to relationship researcher Dr. Helen Fisher, women process potential romantic interests through their social networks way more than men do. It's part of how they evaluate compatibility and get external validation for their feelings.

If her friends are warm to you right away or seem unsurprised by your presence, she's been talking about you. A lot.

## She mirrors your energy and communication style

Not the obvious body language mirroring everyone talks about. I mean she matches how you text, adopts phrases you use, or engages with topics at your enthusiasm level.

This ties into research on interpersonal synchrony. When we're attracted to someone, we subconsciously adapt our communication patterns to create rapport. Dr. Tanya Chartrand's studies on the ""chameleon effect"" show this happens automatically when we want to build connection.

Ash is actually useful here, it's a relationship coaching app. It helps decode communication patterns and shows you when someone's investing emotional energy into matching your vibe versus just surface level chatting. Pretty eye opening honestly.

She starts using your weird vocabulary? Texts back with similar energy levels? That's her brain trying to sync with yours.

## She initiates plans but keeps them casual

Here's where guys mess up constantly. She suggests hanging out but frames it super casually. ""We should grab coffee sometime"" or ""Let me know if you want to check out that restaurant.""

She's interested but managing risk. Social psychologist Dr. Bella DePaulo's research shows women often downplay their romantic interest initially to avoid vulnerability. By keeping suggestions casual, she's creating plausible deniability while still moving things forward.

The key isn't what she suggests, it's that she's initiating at all. Most people don't repeatedly create opportunities to spend time with someone unless they want something to develop.

Models by Mark Manson completely changed how I understood this dynamic. It's basically the bible for authentic attraction and vulnerability in dating. Manson breaks down how people communicate interest while protecting themselves emotionally. Insanely good read. Won a bunch of awards and Manson's whole approach is refreshingly honest about modern dating psychology. This book will make you question everything you think you know about playing it cool.

For anyone wanting to go deeper into the psychology behind all this, there's BeFreed, a personalized learning app built by Columbia alums and former Google engineers. Type in something like ""become more confident in dating as an introvert"" and it pulls from books like Models, research on attraction psychology, and actual dating expert insights to create a custom audio learning plan just for you. 

You can adjust the depth too, start with a quick 10-minute overview or go full 40-minute deep dive with examples when something clicks. The voice options are legitimately addictive, there's this smoky, conversational style that makes complex psychology way easier to absorb during commutes or at the gym. It's been genuinely helpful for connecting the dots between all these books and research I've been reading.

## She's nervous around you (in small ways)

Not like anxiety nervous. But fidgeting slightly, talking faster than normal, or having moments where she seems less composed than usual.

Attraction triggers physiological responses we can't fully control. According to research in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, people experience measurable increases in cortisol and adrenaline around those they're attracted to. This manifests as subtle nervousness.

If she's normally confident but seems slightly off her game around you, or if she has moments of seeming flustered after sustained eye contact, her nervous system is responding to attraction whether she's consciously aware of it or not.

Look, none of these are guarantees. Human behavior is messy and context dependent. But when you start noticing multiple signals clustering together, you're probably not imagining things. The research backs up what most of us intuitively know but second guess ourselves on.

The real skill isn't just spotting these signs. It's having enough self worth to actually act on them when you see them. But that's a whole other post.",1,1769862778.0,AttractionDynamics,0,1.0,False

In the early morning haze of 2026, Elias stood on the balcony of his newly handed-over apartment in Dubai Creek Harbour. Below him, the water mirrored a skyline that seemed to have doubled in complexity since he first arrived a decade ago. Back then, the ""World’s Tallest Tower"" was the primary headline; today, the narrative had shifted from mere height to a more profound sense of ""maturity.""
The Dubai real estate story of the mid-2020s wasn't just about glass and steel—it was about a city finding its permanent pulse.
The Shift to Stability
For years, the market was a playground for speculators chasing 20% annual gains. But as 2026 took hold, the ""Gold Rush"" energy had cooled into something more sustainable. Reports from the start of the year showed capital gains moderating to a steady 10%, a sign that the market was maturing. The frantic ""buy-to-flip"" culture of the post-pandemic boom had been replaced by ""buy-to-live.""
Elias looked toward the horizon where Dubai South and the Expo City districts were blooming. These weren't just clusters of buildings; they were ""walkable ecosystems."" The demand for villas and townhouses had remained white-hot, outperforming apartments as families from Europe and Asia moved to the desert not for a tax haven, but for a home.
The Rise of the ""Green"" Premium
What struck Elias most about his new community was the intelligence of it. His balcony glass wasn't just decorative; it was smart-tinting, reacting to the intense Arabian sun to slash cooling costs. In 2026, ""luxury"" had been redefined. It was no longer just about gold-leafed lobbies; it was about:
Solar integration in every villa.
AI-driven energy management that predicted consumption patterns.
Vertical forests in Business Bay that acted as natural air filters.
The ""Green Premium"" was now a measurable financial reality. Properties with high ESG scores were commanding higher rents and better resale values, as the modern global investor became as conscious of their carbon footprint as their ROI.
A Global Safe Haven
As Elias sipped his coffee, he thought of his neighbors—a tech entrepreneur from London, a logistics head from Mumbai, and a retired couple from Oslo. The 2025 year had seen over 197,000 transactions, a record fueled by the Golden Visa reforms and the city’s reputation as a ""safe harbor"" in a volatile world.
The story of Dubai real estate in 2026 is one of a city that stopped trying to prove it belonged on the world stage and started acting like it owned it. With over 100,000 new units entering the market this year, the choice was no longer about finding anything available, but about finding the right lifestyle.

**About me:**

* I love learning and sharing random facts
* Into cozy games like heartopia
* Pork sinigang, kare-kare, and kaldereta supremacy. Also love pasta
* Night owl energy —late-night conversations are my thing. (Yes, I’m trying to fix my sleep schedule na

**What I’m looking for:**

* Taller than me
* Someone kind, empathetic, and socially aware.
* A person with self-awareness and accountability—growth matters to me.
* Someone who enjoys good conversations, whether deep life talks or random nonsense.
* Someone who values quality time —going out, trying new things, or staying in with a movie.
* Physical attraction matters, so I’m open to swapping pics early on.
* NCR-based
* Available on Feb 5 and/or 6

**Random but important info:**

* Certified listener, but texts > calls (unless I really like you).
* Coffee lover. Iced >>> hot.
* Music taste ranges from Taylor Swift & Kanegi to Clairo & Sleep Token
* Soft spot for animals, especially strays. But can’t take care of one
* Not tall — 5’0” huhu

I'm pretty sure there's nothing like it anywhere in my region yet.And that alone could drive way more customers to my place if I get the concept and execution right. 
I went to this bar a few weeks ago with a couple of friends just to hang out n unwind after a long week.The place was unique in every single way.The decor,the vibe,the drinks,everything was well thought out. 

But when I found out about the smart coffee tables they had scattered throughout the space,that was the height of it all for me.I was completely sold on the experience.

These tables weren't just regular furniture.They had built in technology that actually served a purpose.The coolest feature? You could charge your phone directly on the table surface without needing any wires or cables.Just place your phone down on a designated spot, n it starts charging wirelessly. 

I immediately started thinking about how I could bring that same concept into my own bar.Imagine customers being able to sit down,charge their devices,order food n drinks without waiting for a server, n enjoy the convenience all in one spot.People would absolutely love it,especially younger crowds who are always on their phones n appreciate tech forward experiences.I've been researching options online n found several suppliers on Alibaba selling smart coffee tables at different price points.Some are more expensive with advanced features,while others are more basic but still functional. 
My goal is to save up enough to buy at least three or four of these tables to start with.If they perform well n customers respond positively,I'll invest in more n maybe even make it a signature feature of my business.

I'm excited to see how this plays out.
