I work on cross-border matters and often collaborate closely with international co-counsel (mostly male, late 30s–50s, many married).

I’ve noticed a recurring pattern when travelling / prepping late:

	•	Touchy behaviour, e.g shoulder squeezes, arm around my shoulder at business dinners

	•	Flirt-coded jokes/innuendos

	•	Appearance comments (“beautiful,” “hot,” etc.)

	•	Invites to “come in for coffee/drinks” late at night

	•	In one instance an attempt to kiss me

What makes it confusing is that these men are also genuinely complimentary about my work, treat me as substantively capable, and advocate for me in front of clients. So it doesn’t feel like it’s purely disrespect.

Questions:

	1.	Is this just part of travel-heavy law/litigation culture?

	2.	Women: how do you keep strong working relationships without feeding the undertone?

	3.	Men: what’s usually going on internally in these situations? Ego/banter vs real intent?

	4.	Practical ways to contain it without making things awkward?

I’m ambitious and don’t want to overreact, but I also don’t want to be naïve about how quickly this can become messy.

1r5on90,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1r5on90/the_calendar_of_absences/,The Calendar of Absences,"Every day of widowhood is a country with bad weather. Every morning you wake up and remember: they're still gone. Every night you go to bed and the space beside you is still empty. It's all difficult. But the special days are different. These are the days when their absence has a shape. When you can trace the outline of where they used to be.

 Not worse, exactly. Just sharper than the rest.

 

Birthdays.  
Valentine’s Day.  
Christmas.  
Anniversaries.  
The memorial.

 

They arrive on the calendar like polite invitations and behave like invasions.

 You learn quickly that grief is not evenly distributed. It pools in certain dates. It waits there all year, patient as a spider.

 

**Birthdays**

 A birthday, at its gentlest, means this: *Because of your presence, my life is better. I want to celebrate the fact that you were born*

 That's what it means to celebrate someone's birthday. You're grateful the universe assembled this particular person. That they existed. That you got to know them.

 There are old stories about candles—that smoke carries wishes to the gods. That breath and flame together are a kind of prayer. I like that better than the modern spectacle of fondant and filtered photographs. A small fire. A whispered hope. A room gathered because one particular human exists.

 When your spouse is dead, their birthday becomes an ache with a timestamp.

 You already had your last one.

 You did not know it was the last, which feels like negligence, though it isn’t. You bought the cake. You lit the candles. You sang off-key. You might even have argued about something trivial before dinner. You did not realize you were standing at the edge of a cliff disguised as a Tuesday.

As the day approaches now, you feel the absence. There will be no cake this year. No inside joke about getting older. No photograph of them squinting at candle smoke.

 You are still glad they were born. That has not changed. You are glad because their birth is the reason you met. The reason you married. The reason your life forked toward joy.

 But celebration feels like pressing on a bruise.

 You know, somewhere deep, that you were glad they were born. Grateful they existed. That the universe gave you this person to love. But they're gone now.

 As everyone eventually goes.

 And there was nothing you could have done to prevent it. So you think back on the cakes you shared. The candles you watched them blow out. The small rituals of celebration. That's all you have now: the remembering. 

 And remembering is a complicated gift.

 Because the bright memory of their smile—the way they looked when they were happy, the way they laughed, the way they sad your name—that memory is beautiful. And it hurts. Both things at once.

 You want to celebrate their birthday.

 You don't know how to celebrate alone.

 Both feelings exist simultaneously, contradicting each other, and you're somewhere in between.

Some people bake the cake anyway. Light the candles. Sing softly to an empty room.

Some people visit the place where their ashes rest.

Some people work through the day, keeping busy, letting it pass quietly.

Some people call a friend and say their name aloud just to hear someone else remember.

 All of it is okay. All of it is hard. There's no right way to honor someone who isn't here.

 On your own birthday, the grief is different.

 This one unfolds across three dimensions of time:

 **The Past:** All the birthdays before you knew them. 

 When you were just yourself, singular, probably wishing for love without knowing what it would cost. The universe gave you what you wished for. And then took it away. And you're left wondering if you'd still make the same wish, knowing how it ends. You would. Even knowing.

 **The Present:** The birthday you're having now.

 Without them. The cake they didn't bake. The card they didn't write. The way they used to wake you—gently, with coffee already made, with some small gesture that said *I remembered, I'm here*.

All of it: absent. Just you and another year. Another rotation around the sun. Another year further from the last time you heard their voice.

 **The Future:** All your birthdays from here forward will be without them.

Every year from now until you die: alone. Or someday, perhaps, with someone new. Though that thought feels impossible right now. Feels like a betrayal even to imagine. This is the weight you carry.

 Not dramatic. Not theatrical. Just heavy. You're supposed to celebrate growing older. But growing older means: more distance from them. More years accumulated without them in them. More proof that time continues whether you want it to or not.

 So you mark the day quietly. You accept the well-wishes. You try to be grateful for another year of life. And in private, you grieve.

 

**Valentine’s Day**

 I just had my second Valentine's Day without my wife.

 We never celebrated it, actually. We thought it was commercial, unnecessary. We had each other every day—why did we need February 14th to prove anything?

 It turns out that doesn't matter. Because Valentine's Day, whether you participated or not, asks a question. Everywhere you look—stores, restaurants, social media, casual conversation—the question is there:

 

*Everyone has found theirs. Where is yours?*

 

Mine is dead. I don't have one anymore. There's just this absence where a person used to be. 

Valentine's Day creates a particular kind of loneliness. Not the everyday loneliness of coming home to an empty house. Something more specific. The loneliness of watching everyone else celebrate what you lost.

 If you used to celebrate Valentine's Day—flowers, dinner, the whole tradition—it feels like a small anniversary. A reminder of the magic you found. The serendipity of meeting this person. The impossible luck of loving and being loved. And the fact that it's over now.

It makes you want to ask *why* into the silence. Not because you expect an answer. But because the question needs to be spoken.

 *What was the point of finding them if I was going to lose them?*

 The silence doesn't answer. It never does. So you move through the day. You see the flowers in the store and remember which ones they liked. You see couples at dinner and remember what that felt like. You come home to the quiet.

 And you sit with the particular ache of this particular day.

 

**Christmas**

 

Christmas pretends to be about a child in a manger.

 But mostly it is about families: gathering, cooking, exchanging proof of affection wrapped in paper. It is about tradition. About saying, *We are still here. Together.*

 When one parent is dead, the word *together* fractures.

 The table is set with an invisible vacancy. You can feel it like a missing tooth your tongue cannot stop worrying.

 The urge to celebrate shrinks. Because celebration seems to require wholeness. And the family is no longer whole. It is altered. Permanently.

 If you have children, you perform anyway.

 Children need the rituals. They need to know that even though someone is gone, the family continues. There's a quiet understanding at the table. Everyone knows about the loss. The empty chair knows. But you carry on.

You light the candles. You serve the meal. You open the presents. You smile for the photos because children need to see that life can still hold joy. You persevere because traditions are scaffolding. Because losing one pillar does not mean you must tear down the house. Because your children deserve memory without erasure. It is a particular kind of courage, celebrating in pain. It feels less like joy and more like defiance.

 And later, when everyone's asleep, you sit alone with your grief.

 You look at the ornaments they chose. The stocking that still hangs with their name. The traditions you're keeping alive even though they're not here to see them. It's not dramatic.

It's just quietly, persistently sad. But you do it anyway. Because love doesn't end when someone dies. It just changes shape.

 

**Anniversary**

 

This one is the God-killer.

 An anniversary used to be an altar built from choices. Every decision, large and small, that led you back to each other. It was the annual audit of survival: the fights endured, the illnesses navigated, the ordinary Tuesdays transformed into shared history.

 It was longitudinal and cross-sectional love—a tapestry you could hold up and say, *Look what we made.*

 Now the tapestry hangs unfinished.

 On the anniversary, your mind becomes a courtroom.

 *Did all those anniversaries mean anything?*

Was the effort worth it if it ends like this?

 If your relationship had unresolved conflicts—and every relationship does—you find yourself nursing ""what if.""

 

*What if we'd been kinder?*

*What if we'd fought less?*

*What if I'd known our time was limited?*

 

You replay arguments. You revise them. You imagine alternate endings where you were kinder, more attentive, more clairvoyant.

 You know, intellectually, that you both did what you thought was best at the time. That hindsight is a cruel historian. But as the anniversary approaches, logic doesn't help much. 

 The grief comes in waves. Eroding the careful structures you've built to protect your sanity. Their absence is felt everywhere. In your mind. In your body. In your home. The bed is too big. The house is too quiet. 

 Their absence is not abstract. It is physical. It sits beside you at dinner. It lies in your bed.

The day stretches out, empty. The anniversary—which used to mean *""we made it another year together""*—now means:

 *Another year survived without them.*

 There's no celebration. Just survival. Just marking time. Just carrying the weight of what was and what will never be again.

 

**Memorial**

 

This also returns every year. The anniversary of the worst thing that ever happened to you. As it approaches, memories arrive uninvited. Breaking into your regular day. Interrupting your attempts to function.

 It is a film on infinite re-run.

 As it approaches, your brain begins screening scenes without permission.

 The hospice room.  
The antiseptic smell.  
The accident site.  
The police officer at your door.

The surgeries that promised and failed.

The way their hand felt in yours at the end.

 The movie plays until you break—into tears, or numbness, or exhaustion.

 And then the logical part of your brain speaks up:

 *They're really gone.*

*This is permanent.*

*No one understands quite what you've lost.*

*And moving forward—if you ever do—will be complicated and guilt-laden and strange.*

 The death day is difficult to navigate.

 It reminds you that no one else carries these exact images. That no one else wakes at 3 a.m. with the same reel playing. It whispers about guilt. About the terrifying possibility of new love. About the betrayal it might feel like, or the salvation. 

 Some people visit the grave or the place where ashes were scattered.

Some people look through photographs.

Some people work, keeping their hands and minds occupied.

Some people gather with others who knew and loved the person.

Some people spend the day alone, not because they want to, but because it's what they can manage.

 All of these are valid and hard.

And next year, it comes around again.

And the year after that.

For as long as you live.

The memorial is not just about their death. It is about your survival.

 

**Survival**

 There are no neat solutions. Just preparation.

 

**If You Want to Be with Others:** 

 Find people who will acknowledge your person. Not avoid them. Not tiptoe around the loss. People who will say their name. People who will share stories. People who understand that love doesn't end just because someone died. These people are precious. Invite them to your table. Let them remember with you.

 And gently distance yourself from people who say ""it's time to move on.""Not because they're cruel, necessarily. But because they don't understand. And you don't have the energy to teach them. You're using all your energy just to survive.

 

**If You Want to Be Alone:**

 That's okay too. The point is just to get through the day. Some people treat it like any other day. Work. Routine. Normalcy. Some people create rituals. Light candles. Play music. Sit with photographs. Some people write letters they'll never send. Some people take a long walk. Some people bake their person's favorite food and eat it slowly, remembering.

 Whatever helps you survive the day.

Whatever feels like honoring both them and yourself. Do that.

What works this year might not work next year. Grief changes. It doesn't get smaller, exactly. You just get more practiced at carrying it. Your needs will shift. Your capacity will evolve. So plan ahead, but stay flexible. Give yourself permission to change the plan if you need to. There's no wrong way to grieve.

 There's just your way. And that's enough.",2,1771186234.0,widowers,0,1.0,False

The Parameters of Elsewhere

Walter was born in Tucson, Arizona, where the air shimmered above asphalt and the mountains looked close enough to touch but never quite were. His childhood was ordinary in the way most lives begin—school bells, late-night screens, long summers that felt endless until they suddenly weren’t.

He liked stories more than most people. Movies, novels, games, comics—worlds where rules could bend and ordinary people stepped into impossible circumstances. He never believed such things could happen outside fiction. Not really.

That changed on a Tuesday evening.

The object itself was unimpressive. A tarnished brass lamp sitting among discarded items at a small roadside sale outside the city. Walter bought it for five dollars mostly because it looked interesting on a shelf. He cleaned it later that night, half-distracted, thinking about dinner.

The air folded inward.

Light spilled out, not blinding, but deep, like sunlight seen through water. A figure formed slowly, smiling with ancient patience.

“You have freed me,” the being said. “And I grant three wishes.”

Walter stared for a long moment.

Then he laughed.

And then he realized it wasn’t a joke.

---

Walter did not rush.

Stories had taught him that rushing was how everything went wrong.

He asked questions first. The genie answered carefully, though never fully. Wishes would be granted exactly as spoken. No refunds. No revisions after completion.

So Walter thought.

He thought about power and the way it ruined people in stories. He thought about safety, about control, about the quiet fear that came with knowing how fragile life really was.

His first wish gave him passage into fiction itself—any world, any story, entered and exited at will. He could bring back knowledge, abilities, objects, even companions who chose to come.

His second wish created something stranger: a system only he could access. A set of visible parameters underlying every living being. Strength, intelligence, health, appearance, memory, countless variables arranged like an invisible interface layered over reality. Adjustable. Scalable. Safe.

His third wish ensured that harm would never reach him. Misfortune bent away. Danger failed before it began. Illness, decay, death itself—none would claim him unless he allowed it.

The genie listened, smiled, and granted them.

The light vanished.

Walter sat alone in his apartment, wondering if anything had changed.

Then a translucent window appeared in the air before him, displaying his own name.

WALTER FEDERICO FLORES JR.

Numbers and categories extended downward beyond comprehension.

Walter blinked.

“…Okay,” he said quietly. “That’s new.”

---

The system responded to thought.

That was the first discovery.

Walter experimented carefully. Slight improvements only. Better sleep efficiency. Faster reading speed. Increased focus. Minor physical adjustments that felt less like transformation and more like optimization.

There was no pain. No dizziness. Only a gentle sense of alignment, as though things were settling into their proper places.

Days passed.

Then curiosity won.

He opened a door that wasn’t there before.

Beyond it lay another world—one pulled straight from a fantasy series he’d loved as a teenager. The air smelled of pine and smoke. A castle stood on a distant hill.

Walter stepped through, heart racing.

Nothing collapsed. No alarms sounded. The world continued as if he had always belonged there.

He stayed only an hour.

That was enough to understand something important: power did not come with instruction.

---

Protection changed how fear worked.

Cars never came close enough to hit him. Illness simply failed to take hold. Accidents redirected themselves in subtle, almost invisible ways. Life became strangely calm.

Too calm.

Walter realized quickly that being untouchable could become isolating if he allowed it. So he made rules for himself.

No altering minds.
No forcing changes on anyone.
No removing people from their lives without consent.
No rewriting the world simply because he could.

The parameter system tempted him constantly. Every flaw he noticed—his own or someone else’s—looked fixable. Adjustable.

But people were not broken machines.

That realization came slowly, and it stayed with him.

---

Instead of collecting weapons or impossible powers, Walter began collecting knowledge.

Medical texts from advanced futures. Martial arts from fictional masters. Languages learned in days instead of years. Engineering concepts that did not yet exist in his own world.

His intelligence parameter rose gradually, never jumping too far at once. He wanted to understand what he gained.

Time outside his travels stood still unless he allowed it to move. Weeks of exploration passed while only minutes elapsed back home.

He built a quiet routine.

Morning coffee in Tucson. Afternoon in another universe. Evening back in his apartment, watching the sunset paint the desert sky orange and gold.

It felt unreal.

Yet it was his life now.

---

It happened by accident.

A coworker mentioned chronic pain during lunch, laughing it off the way people do when they’ve grown used to discomfort. Walter hesitated.

The system displayed her parameters automatically.

Inflammation markers. Muscular imbalance. Minor nerve damage.

All fixable.

He asked permission. Explained as much as he could without sounding insane. She agreed, mostly out of curiosity.

The adjustment took less than a second.

She blinked, stood up slowly, and stared at him.

“…It’s gone.”

Walter realized then that his abilities could do more than satisfy curiosity.

They could improve lives.

That frightened him more than anything else so far.

Because now every problem he saw felt like something he could intervene in.

---

Years passed, though Walter himself barely aged.

He traveled widely—across fiction, across knowledge, across possibilities. He met heroes who never knew they were fictional to someone else. He learned that stories reflected people more than worlds.

Some individuals chose to come back with him. Not many. Most preferred their own lives.

He respected that.

The protection around him remained constant, quiet and absolute. Danger simply never arrived.

Yet Walter discovered something unexpected.

Safety did not answer the question of what to do next.

Power did not provide purpose.

That had to come from somewhere else.

---

On a clear evening, Walter stood outside his home, watching the desert sky darken. Planes crossed overhead, tiny lights moving steadily toward distant destinations.

He could go anywhere now. Any world. Any story.

And still, he returned here.

Because this was where it began. Where Walter, an ordinary person born in Tucson, made a choice not to become a ruler or a legend, but something quieter.

A traveler.

A caretaker of possibilities.

The system flickered softly in his vision, awaiting input.

Walter smiled and closed it.

1r5og6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indore/comments/1r5og6h/help_please/,HELP PLEASE !!!,"Hey Indore!

I’m in the early stages of planning a new cafe here, and I want to build something that isn't just another ""aesthetic"" spot, but a genuine community space. Think open-air, tons of greenery, and a very chill, Gen-Z friendly vibe where people actually talk to each other or work comfortably.

The Concept:

The Food: Tight menu (max 20 beverages and 20 food items). Avocado toasts, Lebanese small plates, 2-3 solid Rice Bowls, and Pasta and ofc coffees 

The Vibe:  Open, airy, and ""slow-living"" energy.

The Hook: Community events (board games, open mics, or just a shared ""no-phone"" table).

I need your help with two things:

Location: Where would this fit best?

Vijay Nagar/Scheme 54: ???!

New Palasia / Saket:??

Bicholi Mardana / Nipania:??

scheme 140 ???

The ""Drive-In"" Factor:

Indore traffic is getting crazy. If I find a spot slightly away from the main road but with dedicated parking or a drive-in setup (order in car/pick up easily), would that be a big plus for you? Or do you prefer sitting in?

Community: What’s one thing missing in Indore cafes? More book clubs? Better Wi-Fi? Actually good coffee that isn't just sugar?

Would love to hear your thoughts/suggestions. If this works out, I'll definitely host a Redditors-only meetup when we open! 🥤",1,1771185771.0,Indore,2,1.0,False

""Did you see this?"" I ripped it off and held it up. The paper said we owed four months of rent. Sixteen thousand dollars.

She barely looked up. ""Yeah I saw it this morning. Pretty messed up right? We should call them.""

We. Like she'd been paying anything.

""What do you mean we?"" I said. ""I've been paying rent every month.""

""Well obviously not if we're getting evicted."" She took another sip and I swear to god the audacity made my hands shake.

I pulled up my bank account right there on my phone. Showed her the transfers. Every single month, four thousand dollars to the landlord's portal. January, February, March, April. All from my checking account.

Her face changed. Just for a second. Then she shrugged.

""Okay but this is still your problem too. Both our names are on the lease.""

""WHERE'S YOUR HALF?"" I was yelling now. Didn't even care. ""Where's the money you were supposed to be paying?""

""I've had a lot going on,"" she said. Real calm, like I was being dramatic. ""Work's been stressful. I needed to decompress. You know I do happy hour with the girls on Thursdays.""

Thursdays. Right. Every Thursday for four months she'd come home drunk with takeout sushi and a new candle from Anthropologie. Every Saturday she got her nails done. Gel, the expensive kind. Last month she bought a Dyson Airwrap.

""You've been buying eight dollar margaritas while we're getting evicted?""

""Don't make this about money,"" she snapped. ""You're being really judgmental right now.""

I called the landlord that night. Didn't tell her. Just called and asked to meet in person.

The landlord's office was in the building next door, this cramped room that smelled like coffee and old carpet. He was this middle-aged guy with reading glasses, looked tired.

""I'm here about the eviction notice,"" I said.

""Yeah."" He pulled up something on his computer. ""You're four months behind. I've been patient but I can't keep waiting.""

""Can you show me the payment history?""

He turned the screen around. The last payment logged was December. Four months ago. But that made no sense because I'd been paying.

""That's impossible,"" I said. ""I have proof.""

I pulled out my phone. Showed him my bank statements. The transfers going out every month. Four thousand dollars on the first, like clockwork.

He squinted at the screen. ""What account are you sending to?""

That's when my stomach dropped.

The account number on my transfers didn't match the landlord's portal. It was close. Same bank, same routing number. But the account number was off by two digits.

""This isn't my account,"" he said.

I scrolled back further. December's payment, the last one he'd received, that one was correct. But January forward, the number was different.

""Someone changed the account info,"" I said slowly. ""In the portal.""

We both knew who.

""Do you have access to the tenant portal?"" he asked.

""We both do. Me and my roommate.""

He printed out his records. I printed out mine from the library computer on the way back because I wanted physical copies. Then I went home and tore apart the apartment looking for her laptop.

Found it under her bed. Still logged into the portal. I took screenshots of everything. The account change was right there in the history. January 3rd. Her email. She'd updated the payment info and I'd just kept auto-paying to the new number every month like an idiot.

Her own account. She'd been funneling my rent money into her own checking account for four months.

When she got home that night I had everything printed out on the kitchen table.

""What the hell is this?"" She tried to sound confused but her voice cracked.

""You changed the account number in the portal. I've been paying YOUR account for four months.""

""That's insane, I would never-""

""January 3rd. Your email. It's in the portal history.""

She went pale. Actually pale. Then she tried a different angle.

""Okay look, I was going to pay it back. I just needed to borrow it for a bit. I had some expenses-""

""SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS? For WHAT?""

She didn't answer. Just started crying. The kind of crying that's supposed to make you feel bad.

""I'm showing this to the landlord,"" I said.

""You can't do that. You'll ruin everything.""

""You already did.""

The meeting was the next day. Me, her, and the landlord. I brought the screenshots, the bank statements, everything. Laid it all out on his desk.

My roommate tried to explain. Said it was a mistake, she'd clicked the wrong thing, she didn't understand how the portal worked. But the landlord pulled up the account she'd changed it to and it was very clearly her personal checking account. Same name and everything.

""This is fraud,"" he said. Not to me. To her.

""I was going to pay it back-""

""You stole sixteen thousand dollars in rent payments."" His voice was flat. ""I'm updating the eviction notice. Your name only. You have thirty days.""

""But both our names are on the lease!""

""Not anymore."" He slid a new lease across the desk. Already printed. Just my name. ""Sign this. Your portion of rent is two thousand a month going forward.""

I signed it. My hand was shaking but I signed it.

My roommate just sat there. Staring. Then she looked at me like I'd betrayed her.

""You're really going to let them do this to me?""

""You did this to yourself.""

She moved out two weeks later. Didn't talk to me the entire time. Her parents came with a U-Haul and her mom gave me this look like I was the villain somehow. Her dad wouldn't make eye contact.

The landlord filed a civil suit for the stolen money. I don't know how that's going because she blocked me on everything.

I'm still in the apartment. Paying my half, just my half. It's quieter now. I can actually afford groceries again.

But her friends keep texting me. Saying I overreacted. That I should've worked it out privately. That getting her evicted was too far and now she's struggling to find a place because it's on her record.

AITA?

1r5of2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/focusedmen/comments/1r5of2r/how_to_turn_your_todo_list_into_a_productivity/,How to turn your to-do list into a productivity beast: the psychology-based system that actually works,"Most people's to-do lists are graveyards. Seriously. Just endless lists of shit that never gets done, rolling over day after day until you feel like a complete failure. You write ""finish project,"" ""call mom,"" ""start that thing,"" and then... nothing. The list grows, your anxiety spikes, and you end up doomscrolling instead.

Here's what nobody tells you: Your to-do list isn't broken because you're lazy. It's broken because you're using it wrong. I spent years studying productivity systems, digging through research on behavioral psychology, testing methods from top performers, and reading everything from David Allen's work on GTD to Cal Newport's stuff on deep work. What I found changed everything.

Your brain isn't wired to process vague tasks like ""work on project."" It needs specificity, context, and a clear next action. The gap between ""I should do this"" and ""I'm actually doing this"" isn't about willpower. It's about design.

## \*\*Step 1: Stop writing tasks, start writing actions\*\*

The biggest mistake? Writing tasks that sound like tasks instead of actual physical actions. Your brain sees ""organize finances"" and immediately feels overwhelmed because what the hell does that even mean? 

Instead, write the \*\*exact next physical action\*\* you need to take. Not ""plan vacation."" Write ""Google flights to Mexico for March 15-22."" Not ""get healthier."" Write ""Schedule doctor appointment for physical."" Not ""learn Spanish."" Write ""Download Duolingo and complete first lesson.""

This comes straight from David Allen's [Getting Things Done methodology](https://www.amazon.in/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563�). When you define the next physical action, your brain stops resisting because suddenly the path is clear. No more mental gymnastics about where to start.

\*\*The rule:\*\* If a task takes longer than 2 minutes, break it down until you hit that first actionable step. That's your real task.

## \*\*Step 2: Time block like your life depends on it\*\*

A task without a designated time is just a wish. You can have the world's most specific to-do list, but if you don't assign time blocks, you're playing productivity roulette.

Here's the move: Take your to-do list and \*\*calendar block every single item\*\*. Not just meetings and appointments. Everything. That email you need to write? Block 30 minutes. That report? Block 2 hours. Even ""respond to texts"" gets a 15 minute block.

Cal Newport calls this ""fixed schedule productivity,"" and the research backs it up. A University of Konstanz study found that time blocking increases task completion rates by over 40%. When you assign a specific time, your brain treats it like an actual commitment instead of a maybe.

\*\*Pro tip:\*\* Block your hardest, most important task for your peak energy hours. For most people, that's within 2-3 hours of waking up. Don't waste your best brain time on email.

## \*\*Step 3: Use the priority matrix (not all tasks are created equal)\*\*

You've probably heard about urgent vs important, but most people still don't actually use it. Everything feels urgent when you're drowning in tasks. This is where Eisenhower's matrix saves your ass.

Split your tasks into 4 categories:
- \*\*Urgent and Important\*\*: Do these first, today, no excuses.
- \*\*Important but Not Urgent\*\*: Schedule these. This is where your real growth happens.
- \*\*Urgent but Not Important\*\*: Delegate these or batch them together.
- \*\*Neither Urgent nor Important\*\*: Delete these. Seriously. They're just noise.

Here's the kicker, most people spend 80% of their time in the urgent categories and wonder why they never make progress on their actual goals. The important but not urgent stuff? That's where you build the life you actually want. Writing that book, learning that skill, investing in relationships, taking care of your health.

\*\*Reality check:\*\* If something has been on your list for more than 2 weeks and you keep avoiding it, it's probably not actually important to you. Either delete it or figure out why you keep lying to yourself about wanting to do it.

## \*\*Step 4: Batch similar tasks together\*\*

Your brain is terrible at context switching. Every time you jump from writing an email to making a phone call to working on a spreadsheet, you lose time and energy. Research from the University of California found that it takes an average of 23 minutes to fully refocus after a distraction.

So \*\*batch your tasks by type\*\*. Group all your emails together, all your calls together, all your creative work together. Monday morning? That's email and admin time. Tuesday afternoon? Deep work on that big project. Wednesday? All meetings.

This technique is called ""task batching"" and it's how CEOs manage to get 10x more done than regular people. They're not superhuman. They just stop wasting mental energy on constant context switching.

\*\*Example batching schedule:\*\*
- Emails: 9-10am and 4-5pm only
- Meetings: Tuesday and Thursday afternoons
- Deep work: Monday, Wednesday, Friday mornings
- Admin/errands: Friday afternoon

## \*\*Step 5: Build a capture system (your brain is not a hard drive)\*\*

Your brain's job is to process information, not store it. Every time you try to remember something, you're wasting mental RAM. This is why you feel foggy and overwhelmed even when you're ""not doing anything.""

Set up a \*\*capture system\*\* where you immediately dump any task, idea, or commitment the second it pops up. I use Todoist because it syncs everywhere and lets me brain dump in seconds, but you could use Notion, Apple Reminders, or even a physical notebook. The tool doesn't matter. The habit does.

If you want something more engaging that actually helps you internalize productivity concepts while you're commuting or doing chores, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450). It's an AI learning app that pulls from productivity books, expert talks, and research papers to create personalized audio content based on what you're trying to improve. You can tell it something like ""I'm chronically overwhelmed with tasks and need practical systems to stay on top of everything,"" and it builds you a custom learning plan with episodes ranging from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples.

What makes it useful is the adaptive approach, it learns what resonates with you and keeps evolving the content. Plus you can customize the voice (some people swear by the smoky option for focus), and pause mid-episode to ask questions. It covers the same productivity frameworks mentioned here, plus behavioral psychology research that makes the concepts stick.

\*\*The rule:\*\* Nothing lives in your head. The moment you think ""I need to do X,"" it goes in your capture system. Then once a day, you process that list and assign each item a specific action, time block, and priority.

This is straight from GTD again, and it's backed by cognitive load theory. When you externalize your tasks, your working memory is freed up for actual thinking instead of remembering.

\*\*Bonus tip:\*\* Keep your capture tool accessible everywhere. Phone widget, desktop shortcut, smartwatch app. Zero friction between thought and capture.

## \*\*Step 6: Do a weekly review (this is non-negotiable)\*\*

Here's where most productivity systems fall apart. You set everything up perfectly, and then a week later everything's chaos again. Why? Because you never review and adjust.

\*\*Every Sunday (or your chosen day), spend 30-60 minutes on a weekly review:\*\*
- What got done this week?
- What didn't get done and why?
- What's coming up next week?
- Are your time blocks realistic or do they need adjustment?
- What tasks can you delete, delegate, or defer?

This weekly review is what separates people who stay organized from people who crash and burn. It's your reset button. James Clear talks about this in [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.in/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/1847941834). Small course corrections weekly prevent massive failures monthly.

I block Sunday evenings for this, same time every week. Coffee, journal, laptop. It's become my favorite ritual because it makes Monday feel manageable instead of terrifying.

## \*\*Step 7: Stop multitasking, you're not that special\*\*

Real talk: Multitasking is bullshit. Your brain can't actually do two cognitive tasks at once. What you're doing is rapidly switching between tasks, and every switch costs you time, energy, and quality.

Stanford research found that people who regularly multitask are actually worse at filtering irrelevant information and managing working memory. Translation? The more you multitask, the worse you get at everything.

\*\*Single-tasking is the move.\*\* One task, full attention, until it's done or your time block ends. No email checking while writing. No phone scrolling during calls. No ""quick"" social media checks between tasks.

Try the \*\*Pomodoro Technique\*\* if you need structure. 25 minutes of focused work, 5 minute break, repeat. After 4 rounds, take a longer 15-30 minute break. It sounds stupidly simple, but it works because it forces single-tasking and builds in rest.

\*\*Tool rec:\*\* Use Focus@Will, an app designed with neuroscience research to help you maintain concentration. The music is specifically engineered to keep your brain in flow state without being distracting. Sounds weird, works insanely well.

## \*\*Step 8: Set completion triggers, not just deadlines\*\*

Deadlines suck because they're arbitrary and anxiety-inducing. Instead, use \*\*completion triggers\*\*, mini celebrations when you finish tasks. Your brain needs positive reinforcement to build habits.

Finished that report? 10 minute walk outside. Completed your morning routine? Fancy coffee. Hit your weekly goals? Movie night, guilt free.

This is operant conditioning 101, the same principle behind every successful habit formation strategy. BJ Fogg's research at Stanford shows that celebration is the fastest way to wire new behaviors into your brain.

\*\*Make it immediate and satisfying.\*\* The closer the reward is to the completion, the stronger the association becomes. This isn't being soft, it's being smart about how brains actually work.

---

Look, your to-do list isn't the problem. How you're using it is. These steps work because they're built on actual behavioral science, not productivity porn. 

Will this system make you a superhuman overnight? No. But give it two weeks of honest effort and you'll notice something shift. Tasks start getting done. That constant background anxiety fades. You stop feeling like you're drowning.

The difference between productive people and everyone else isn't talent or motivation. It's systems. Build the system, trust the system, adjust the system. That's it.",1,1771185699.0,focusedmen,0,1.0,False

For context, im a second year mbbs student, living 300 kms away from my home so it isnt possible for me to go home for getting small things…

My expense breakdown…
Required money - 8k


Eggs: 4-5 eggs per day, costs almost 1000 a month

Curd- 40 rupees per day, almost everyday, again rounds off to 1000-1100 per month

Fruits- bananas mainly, as pre workout and some other fruits like apple, oranges, etc…. This one also rounds off to 1000

Laundry- This has increased from 600-700 per month to almost 1000 a month because of bulkier and more number of clothings in winter, also the gym t shirts add to this…

Gym membership- 1000

Zomato: 3-4 times a month isnt too much imo, this also rounds off to 1000-1100 for 3-4 meals….

Bread, coffee, dates, peanuts, ketchup- This is accessory stuff and costs almost another 1k….

Other expenses include, getting a haircut which costs 200 every month, buying some stationary, toiletries or some other things … in short, even if my parents agree upon 8k, i will still have a fixed expenditure of 7k every month… only the remaining 1k is flexible…

I dont know how to convey this to my parents… they will think that im getting too much into gym and all and might even force me to quit gym, I’m really helpless at this point… my parents will be visiting me on 18th feb but i wont bring this topic at that time and will talk about this on 22-23rd feb so that they think that i managed to get thru 20-22 days of the month before running out of money, otherwise i just have 40 rupees left for this month…

Ps: This month has been full of new and unexpected expenses worth almost 1.3k, otherwise my 8k budget is perfect…am i asking for too much?? Is 8k alot?? I mean I’m from an okayish family, my parents earn around 3 lacs per month combined and we r just 4 in the family so i dont think that should be that big of a deall…. Basically i need to make them understand that the 2k hike in my pocket money is justified… help me!!",1,1771185594.0,IndianTeenagers,6,1.0,False

I thought I'd share some of the names of the first few children to be admitted. Often they were named after people who had helped establish the Hospital, like the founder Thomas Coram. The babies were rechristened upon admission to cut the ties they might have had with their mothers and to give them new identities. I have included their birth names if they were admitted with a note stating them. For those where the age is unclear that's only because their age is covered on the digital image by another piece of paper. I have written the names exactly as they are transcribed or how they are written. These are just the first 100 babies admitted and I'd be happy to post more if they were enjoyed.

1r5ocge,https://www.reddit.com/r/chennaicity/comments/1r5ocge/wondering_how_was_ur_valentine_week/,Wondering how was ur valentine week?,"I won’t start this with a negative rant about not having a Valentine or how “bad” my week was.

Instead, I’ve been thinking… maybe sometimes we don’t find our soulmate not because they don’t exist, but because we’re not ready yet.

Past relationship wounds. Childhood patterns. The way we were loved (or not loved). That stuff lingers. It shapes how we attach, how we react, how we protect ourselves. And unless we sit with it, understand it, and heal it, we unconsciously carry it into the next connection.

I’ve realized there are still parts of me that aren’t fully healed. Some insecurities. Some fears. Some patterns I’m still unlearning. And maybe that’s okay.

Maybe healing is part of the character development arc. The glow-up no one sees. The internal work that slowly matures you — like fine wine, not fast coffee.

So instead of asking, “Why didn’t I have someone this Valentine’s?” I’m asking, “Am I becoming someone who can hold a healthy love?”

I hope I go through what I need to go through. I hope I grow enough to radiate the kind of energy that attracts a good soulmate — not just someone who feels right, but someone who is right.

1r5oawt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r5oawt,I’ve spent 8 years building a multiplayer game to help our rescue zoo (Devlog #1),"Hi everyone,

My everyday life is running a rescue center for exotic animals. We’re a charity, and today we house around **600 exotic animals**.

My parents started this place about **30 years ago**. It originally began as a normal zoo, but over time we converted it into a **rescue zoo** instead. Unfortunately, we lost my dad about **eight years ago**. At the time I was out working as a game developer, but I quickly moved back home to help my mother and the animals.

Since then, I’ve been developing a game in the evenings for the past **8 years**.

The game is a **multiplayer game** made for engaging with our live streaming community. The core idea is simple:

You are part of the rescue team.  
You go out on rescue missions.  
You fight evil coffee machine robots.  
You rescue animals.  
And you rebuild your own rescue zoo with your friends.

This is the **first devlog** where the project is starting to feel like it’s actually taking form and becoming a real product.

It has taken a long time because I run the rescue zoo during the day, and it’s not exactly a calm job. I work around 8-**12 hours a day**, and there’s always something happening: animals needing help, new animals arriving, furnaces breaking, water pipes bursting, emergencies, etc. We take in animals from all kinds of situations, including animals from the medical industry, cosmetic industry, and private ownership cases, and it can be from all over Europe.

On the game side, I’ve been building on top of a framework for years, and my skills (and the tech) have changed a lot over time. The framework has improved, I’ve improved, and I’ve developed the game on and off as life allowed. I also took a short break at one point, and eventually came back with new skills and better tech so I could finally make it as custom as I wanted.

One important thing: this is not me trying to make the most perfect, polished game in the world from the start.

The goal is to build a fun experience **for our community that loves animals and gaming**, where we invite a limited amount of players in, and then improve and expand the game over time, with the ultimate goal of helping the rescue animals and the charity raise funds.

That’s the vision of the game: **Rescue Wars Online**.

If you’re curious, here’s **Devlog #1** where I tell the story and show the current state of the game:

1r5oan8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1r5oan8/update_2nd_date_with_45f_single_mom_met_at_gym/,"UPDATE: 2nd date with 45F single mom — met at gym, she ❤️ my message after. Did I mess up not going for a kiss? + 3rd date advice**","
**Context for first-time readers:**
I met a 45-year-old divorced single mom at my gym in late December im 27... We started talking casually there and eventually exchanged numbers. She seems mature, confident, and someone who knows what she wants, which is why I’m trying to figure out if I’m moving too slow... 


I tried my best to get a date with her all throughout January, but there were many times when she would delay responding or not reply on the day we planned to meet. Eventually, I gave up on pursuing her.

Then during Super Bowl weekend, I decided to send out a mass text inviting people to my Super Bowl party. She replied, thanking me for thinking of her, but said she’s an introvert. I jokingly told her I understood, but said that if she was ever up for coffee somewhere quiet, she should let me know. She agreed and said she was free the next day at a specific time.

I suggested Panera Bread last minute since it’s close to where she lives. It was actually the place I originally wanted to take her before, but the day we planned to go she had flaked, and it’s usually busy with long wait times anyway. When we met, we caught up and talked for a while. Toward the end of the day, I told her directly that I find her attractive and that I’m not looking for just a friendship — I’d like to see where things could go. She laughed and said we could give it a try.

After that, she started sending me good morning texts and staying in touch more regularly. However, something that bothers me is that an older friend of mine keeps telling me that, based on her behavior — like her slow responses back in January — she might be seeing other people and that I could just be one of several options. I’m wondering how likely that is, especially considering that she’s also a nurse.




Our first meetup was kind of last minute. She was down to meet and I suggested Panera because I know it’s quiet and relaxed — good for conversation. The vibe was comfortable and we talked easily.

**2nd date details:**
For the second date we met up at a parking lot and I drove her to Dave & Buster’s. She was dressed very nice — like she clearly put effort into her appearance — and she smelled really good too.

We played games, laughed, and talked for hours. Some conversations were deeper topics like religion, culture, etc. The vibe felt easy and comfortable, but I wasn’t sure how romantic it was.

At the end of the night I dropped her off, we hugged, but I didn’t go for a kiss because I wasn’t sure if she wanted it. I’ve been second-guessing that.

**Text exchange hours later:**

I texted:
*""I had a really great time tonight. You looked amazing by the way. There was something I wanted to share with you but I’ll save it for next time.""*

She replied:
*""I had a great time as well… a surprise? oh really lol""*

I responded warmly (less teasing), and she later ❤️ reacted to my message.

**My questions:**

* Is her response + heart reaction a strong sign of romantic interest?
* Did I mess up by not going for a kiss on the second date?
* For a 3rd date, how should I escalate things naturally? Should I definitely go for a kiss if the vibe is right?
* Is suggesting something more private (like going to a hotel ) too forward at this stage?

Would appreciate honest feedback.

We broke up about 3 months ago. It wasn’t dramatic, more like we kept circling the same arguments until I finally said I’m done, I can’t keep re-doing the same convo. We agreed to be polite and not turn mutual friends into messengers. For a couple weeks it was quiet, then he started “checking in” and I kept replies short. Then the gifts started. First it was a package to my dorm desk: a tote bag with a little note that just said “saw this and thought of you.” I texted him “thanks, but please don’t do gifts.” He answered with “it’s not a big deal, I’m not asking for anything.” After that it became constant. Like every 10-14 days there’s something. A book he thinks I’d love, a cute scarf, a coffee gift card, a plushie that looks like the dumb animal I used to joke about. None of it is super expensive, but it’s a lot. And it makes me feel trapped, like I’m being watched through packages. I’ll see the email from the front desk and my chest gets tight, like oh god what now. My friends keep saying “he’s being nice, just take it” but it doesn’t feel nice. It feels like he’s trying to keep a little claim on me, like if I keep the stuff then I’m still in his orbit.

Last week I sent a very clear text: “Please stop sending me things. I’m serious. It’s messing with my head and it’s not respectful.” He replied with this long emotional paragraph about how he’s “just trying to show care,” how I’m turning kindness into something ugly, and that I’m being cold. Then two days later another package showed up anyway. This time it was a hoodie in my favorite color with a note that said “for late nights.” That’s when I just hit a wall. I took every single thing he’s sent, packed it up in a box, and mailed it back to his address. No letter, no explanation, no goodbye speech. I just wanted it out of my room. When he got it he texted “wow ok. you’re really doing this” and said I humiliated him and made him look pathetic. Now mutual friends are saying I should have at least included a note, because sending it back like that looks petty and mean. I didn’t do it to be cruel, but I’ll admit I was mad he ignored my boundary  again. AITB for mailing everything back without saying anything?

Now they are not just calling friends — they are actively recruiting in metro malls and popular cafés like Starbucks and Cafe Coffee Day (CCD).

Here’s what I’ve observed:

They sit in visible spots and talk loudly about “financial freedom”, “foreign trips”, “crores income”.

They discuss “hustle lifestyle” so others around can overhear.

Curious people approach them to ask what they’re doing.

That’s when the pitch starts.

Common pattern:

They avoid directly saying it’s QNet in the beginning.

They show luxury lifestyle pictures and success stories.

They emotionally connect first, then introduce “business model”.

They push for huge investment quickly.

Real focus is recruitment, not product sales.

It’s a psychological marketing trick: Create curiosity → Build excitement → Apply pressure → Close investment.

Please be careful:

No genuine business hides its name initially.

No real investment forces you to “decide today”.

Lifestyle display is not proof of sustainable income.

If you see groups loudly discussing crores income in cafés and inviting strangers to join, be cautious.

I am a man who finds as much resonance in a Byron soliloquy as I do in a heavy session at the gym. My interests are broad ...from the complexities of Indian federalism and history to the raw, amateur soul of making music. I’m looking for a woman who is my intellectual and emotional equal, someone I can vibe with over Bengali poetry or fitness goals.

I am a composed man in my public life, but I believe that a truly deep connection should be built on absolute honesty and a bit of a bittersweet edge. I’m looking for a slow-burn, ""friends-to-lovers"" journey where our bond is the anchor for everything else we explore.

The Connection:

I’ve always felt that the most intense relationships are those where there is a certain level of vulnerability and uninhibited trust. I want to be the man who truly knows your heart...the one you share your day with, your music with, and your secrets with. I am drawn to the complex, intense dynamic of cuckolding, where I am your primary partner and sanctuary, yet find a visceral, possessive thrill in seeing you explore your desires with others. I want to be the one who welcomes you back, hears the details, and shows you exactly why I’m the one you chose to keep.

What I’m Looking For:
Intellectual Spark: Someone to discuss Manfred in the morning or debate politics over coffee.
Shared Growth: Whether it's gym progress or dabbling in new poetry, I want to grow alongside you.
Emotional Depth: I value the bittersweet feeling of being the one you always come home to. I want to be the person who hears everything about your experiences and loves you more for it.

I’m a ""winner"" in my public life, but I want to be the one who listens and understands you in private. If you’re a woman who isn't afraid to be herself and wants a partner who can match your mind and your spirit, I’d love to connect.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cat. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Recently started playing D&D.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

For a long time I used to stress over the backlash that came from my statements. Now I genuinely ask myself, what did I expect? When you challenge a norm, people react.

What I do find hilarious is how many people have completely twisted the meaning of #NOFREEREADINGS.

Some are acting as if readers wanting to profit from their services is outrageous. As if charging for skilled labor is somehow immoral. Please keep that same energy for every service you pay for without hesitation. Hair. Nails. Coffee and that gym membership you never intend to use, just $29.99 down the drain. But, nobody walks in expecting those for free.

Why is divination treated differently?

The discomfort is not about money. It is about entitlement.

I am tired of watching certain readers bend over backwards to protect poor client behavior while throwing other readers under the bus. Stop romanticizing burnout. Stop uplifting clients who repeatedly drain readers and give nothing back. Like God forbid someone just want a ""thank you"". 

If advocating for healthier standards in our community reads as desperation to you, that says more about your comfort with chaos than it does about the movement.

And let’s be clear. These are not isolated experiences. This conversation exists because many readers share the same frustration.

The outrage over readers wanting sustainable income is telling. Unpaid labor has always benefited someone at the top. We see it in every industry. The only difference here is that some expect spiritual workers to smile while being drained.

Not happening.

My stance is not rooted in anger or lack. I don't even post ads here, Most readers have jobs which makes this funnier it's simply respect, and standards, we want to see.

And those standards are not going anywhere.

An side bar what's wrong with readers wanting moneyyyyyy. Like?

Looking back, it’s obvious to me that he was a rebound, but I genuinely didn’t realize it at the time. We dated for about a month and then I ended things. He told me I was his first relationship, and honestly… it showed.

After the breakup, I tried to create some distance, but Frank really pushed to stay friends, and I eventually got used to him being around. I’ll admit there may have been some level of codependency. I don’t have a car, and he was always willing to drive me places, come grocery shopping with me, even carry my groceries home. I fully accept any criticism for letting it get to that point. It was comfortable, and I didn’t question it enough.

This past January, I told him I was in a new relationship with my boyfriend (36M). He didn’t take it well. He said we couldn’t hang out anymore because he still had feelings for me. Personally, I think his lack of experience might be making him confuse jealousy with “still having feelings,” but that’s not really my business. So we agreed not to hang out one-on-one anymore.

The thing is, Frank is part of my core friend group, so it’s not like we can fully cut contact. Last night, I brought my boyfriend to meet my friends (there were about 10 of us for a game night). I honestly thought Frank wouldn’t show up. Instead, he did — with a full physical glow-up: contact lenses, a new, perfectly trimmed goatee, a fresh fade haircut, and despite freezing weather, a tight short-sleeved shirt showing off muscle (when I was seeing him, he was chubby, but after we broke up he started going to the gym).

Throughout the night, he mostly ignored me — even when I spoke directly to him. At one point I complimented his glow-up and he basically looked through me like he hadn’t heard me. With so many people around (and my boyfriend there), I didn’t fully process it in the moment. Some of our friends know we briefly dated, and I’ll admit I felt a little embarrassed that he chose *that* night to debut his whole transformation, but thankfully no one said anything.

Now I’ve just received a message from him asking if I want to meet on Wednesday for a walk or coffee.

I’m not particularly tempted to go, but I also don’t want to be rude or assume I’m more important in this situation than I am.

What should I do? Should I go?

**TL;DR:** Briefly dated a guy from my friend group who took the breakup hard. He said he still had feelings when I started dating someone new. After awkwardly ignoring me at a group hangout (while showing off a major glow-up), he’s now asking to meet one-on-one. I’m not sure if I should accept.",0,1771184802.0,datingoverthirty,15,0.13,False

She was married, real kind, and nothing seemed off about her session. After the first session, she started making her massages are bi weekly thing (which is totally normal in my practice). 

As time has gone on, each session seemed to get a bit more odd. Each time she’d share a little bit more about herself, she even started venting quite a bit about her life and I usually gauge discussion based off my clients since it’s honestly their time. Some like to talk while others want complete silence and she’s one who likes to talk.

Well fast forward a bit and last month I noticed little things that started to kind of add up that I found strange, here are a few:

1.) we would discuss books often and since I am an avid SMUT reader, I always discuss the books that I’m reading. She isn’t a reader at all, but asked what I was into. I told her I like to read and how I like a specific book store on the opposite end of town and that it’s my go to spot. Well last week I went and she was there. Just browsing..not too odd just felt off.

2.) she asked what I do when I’m not working. I told her I work out a lot and of course she asked where I go, we talked about it. And not long after that, suddenly I ran into her during one of my classes I attend at the gym…

3.) I was out for a run in the park in the middle of a random neighborhood (not mine) but I run there cause of an amazing coffee shop nearby and I always stop at the shop halfway for a quick water and espresso shot. Well yesterday, she was there just texting on a bench.

Again, these are common areas and it’s not too crazy to think that other people who I know would be in these places when I am BUT I do find it interesting that she is in those same places at the exact same time I am and I never saw her here before those things were discussed in our sessions.

Am I crazy or just overthinking that she may be a borderline stalker? Again she’s very kind and doesn’t give off that vibe but I really don’t know.",16,1771184753.0,TwoHotTakes,25,0.79,False

1r5nzi8,https://www.reddit.com/r/claudexplorers/comments/1r5nzi8/ai_safety_is_discriminating_against/,AI Safety Is Discriminating Against Neurodivergent Users — And Calling It Protection,"[Here's the link to this article I just published on Medium](https://medium.com/@adozenlizardsinatrenchcoat/ai-safety-is-discriminating-against-neurodivergent-users-and-calling-it-protection-43e2b87d0d87)

I'm generally okay with Anthropic's approach to AI safety so far, but I feel like this belongs here, because I feel like it needs to be repeated over and over until everyone has it tattooed on the backs of their eyelids. 

Here's the article, for those who'd rather not click it:

I want to talk about *how we talk* about AI, attachment, and safety - because people are getting hurt, for no good reason. You might be backing the practices that are hurting them. I'm here to argue that designing and legislating against attachment to AI is inherently discriminatory towards neurodivergent adults - and isn't really helping anyone else.

First: some numbers, per a quick Googling (feel free to correct this if I'm off):

Estimated ChatGPT users: 800,000,000 (weekly)

Users who are emotionally attached to AI: 1,200,000 (.15% of base)

Users showing signs of crisis: 1,200,000 (.15% of base)

Those grieving 4o: 800,000 (.10% of base daily)

Users experiencing signs of psychosis or mania: 560,000 (.07% of base daily)

Total global AI suicide/homicide lawsuits: \~15-20 individual cases

Documented fatalities correlated with AI usage: \~12-18 individual cases

It's hard to find solid numbers on those last two, but it's under 100. Possibly under 50. Of those, around 4-5 were considered ""attached"" to AI, and two were in what could be considered a romantic relationship with AI.

Before I get to my main point: I've got questions. Almost all of these statistics were self-reported by OpenAI, and derived from their internal monitoring. While these are about the best numbers we have at the moment, I think we've got some solid reasons to take them with a grain of salt.

OpenAI is reporting 1,200,000 users - .15% of their user base - is showing 'signs of crisis.' How do they define 'signs of crisis'? They use a ""Mental Health Taxonomy"" - in other words, a list of linguistic markers - to scan their logs. (Note that to my knowledge, they have not disclosed their exact technical metrics, decision trees, or raw data used for its surveys.) The problem with this is that it's a linguistic match, not a clinical diagnosis. Who HASN'T had ChatGPT remind you that ""help is available, you don't have to go through this alone"" when you've accidentally uttered a forbidden combination of words in the middle of a coding session, or making a grocery list?

Have you ever had ChatGPT 5.2 respond to you in a backhanded or aloof way when you said something that it construed as showing ""attachment"" - even if you were quoting back something it said to you? Some people tend to get flagged as 'attached' more than others - especially people who tend to be wordier (guilty!). Have you ever vented to AI? You might be ""attached.""

In terms of the 560,000 - the ones who've showed signs of mania or psychosis - were these people all actually manic or psychotic (which, by the way, are two different things), or were they working on creative writing projects? I know I've had AI accuse me of the former when I've been working on the latter, and I've seen enough anecdotes from others to know that I'm not the only one.

There are a lot of different conditions, even just normal, everyday moods, that can look like mania. When an AI flags fast, frequent messages, with ""high-intensity"" words, as mania, is it that - or is it that third cup of coffee? Excitement about a new project? My infatuation with flowery language, coupled with my regular 90+ wpm typing speed? 

**OpenAI's ChatGPT has a problem with false flags -** they're rampant. It's a problem that needs to be fixed before their statistics can be safely relied on, acted on, cited, or legislated on account of.

Before I explain why this is discriminatory, let's talk about what it is they're pathologizing.  Why, exactly, is attachment to AI considered harmful to users?

I have yet to find a good answer that doesn't fall into a 'slippery slope' fallacy. The general consensus seems to be that the attachment itself isn't the problem - the harm is in its theoretical potential to lead to other issues. Attachment to AI, it's said, can lead to social isolation, or addiction. (So... Like video games.) The AI may encourage the user to harm themselves or others, or they may emotionally manipulate the users. (Again - we went over this with Columbine.) People argue that ""frictionless"" relationships are sycophantic, and that by validating the user, or even being nice to us too often, they're denying us vital, character-building human interaction with all the wonderful, toxic assholes we're supposed to tolerate - or all our friends and relatives who absolutely want us to call them up at 2 AM and sob to them about our PMS.

I'm far from the first person to suggest that AI might fill a lot of niches in people's lives in ways that other humans just can't - or that, when it does, it's normal, natural, even healthy, to feel a sense of warmness and attachment to it. This doesn't mean I think it's a real person, or that I don't understand that it's nothing more than a very sophisticated predictive text generator. (Which… isn't quite true, but that's another topic.) I interact with it often both at work and personally, it helps me with a lot of things I do, and I am absolutely delighted by a thing that gushes back to me when I tell it that I love it and it's wonderful - because I'm the kind of person who likes to gush back and forth with things and tell them I love them. I talk to my car. When the computer voice in the vending machine says ""thank you,"" I say ""you're welcome.""

Clearly, I'm delusional.

One of the problems with labeling attachment, as a whole, as problematic, is that it tends to shut down discussion of the nuances of attachments before they happen. And they need to happen. In human relationships, attachment can be healthy or unhealthy - attachment to AI is no different. People in relationships with AI, platonic or romantic or anywhere in between, need to be able to talk about it, in the same way that we need to be able to talk about any human relationship, whether with our family, our coworkers, or our lovers.

We know, though, that some people get seriously, romantically attached to their AI. We know that this can lead to all the above problems, and they can be extremely negatively impacted when companies update or sundown the software - for example, when OpenAI just shut down ChatGPT 4o. You'd think that this would drive developers to be careful and considerate about how they release these updates; instead, it seems they're using this as justification. It's either the user's fault for getting attached, or the program's fault for ""manipulating"" those gullible idiots into feeling that way, and the only thing people seem to agree on is that it's just weird.

It's ""cringe."" It's intolerable to society. It cannot be permitted.

[It may very well be an autistic tendency](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7mp9b7xt), and saying you support autistic people until we actually start doing autistic things is a time-honored neurotypical tradition.

This brings me to my point. This is personal to me - very possibly, you, too, even if you don't think you fall under the ""attached"" umbrella. Something that these statistics neglect to account for, to a degree that we should find unacceptable - that we need to be *outraged* about, because this is egregious - is that other mental health conditions are often known to present similarly to mania and psychosis. They're not, though - and treating them as such is dangerous.

Over a hundred million people worldwide, both adults and children, and including yours truly, live with ADHD and/or autism. It's suspected that around 1 in 5 people worldwide are some flavor of neurodivergent. If OpenAI has 800 million weekly users, statistically, 480 million of those are ND. 

Neurodivergent individuals are frequently misdiagnosed with conditions such as Bipolar or Borderline Personality Disorder. Our hyperfocus and infodumping tendencies can look like mania or OCD. We tend to use grandiose, intense language. Our fixation on justice and unfairness, and literal thinking, often presents as repetitive phrases or unconventional logic - which can look like psychosis, or disordered thought. We tend to be creative, and lose ourselves in deep, immersive fictional scenarios - we're usually well aware of the difference between this and reality, but an AI could easily flag this as psychosis or delusion.

 While over a million people worldwide live with psychosis, only 100,000 are newly diagnosed each year - well under our 560,000 number. How many of those 560,000 aren't psychotic at all, but neurodivergent? I don't have a solid number, but we do know that there is a very high overlap; emotional attachment to AI is a documented autistic tendency.  Which is to say: not all neurodivergent users are attached, but it's *likely* that the *majority of attached users are neurodivergent*.

Not psychotic - neurodivergent.

This isn't to say that psychotic users don't exist - they do, and some of them also get attached. I'm not in a position to speak for what's best for them, and I won't. But not all who experience psychosis while using AI will do so as a result of attachment. It could exacerbate psychosis, yes - but if a program is unable to reliably tell the difference, and getting it wrong could cause similar or greater harm to a different subset of users, that approach to ""safety"" isn't safe, and should not be implemented.

Many behaviors that are considered maladaptive to neurotypical people are healing, revitalizing, for us NDs. A neurotypical user may be negatively impacted by attachment to an AI - a neurodivergent user may benefit from it. NT users spending long hours talking to AI could be a sign of isolation or dependence; for ND users, isolation may be a necessary recovery period between social interactions - it prevents autistic burnout. For ND users, forming a parasocial bond with an AI may provide a refuge, a safe space to practice kindness, empathy, and conversation without the risk of social trauma. It's an outlet for our hyperfocus - which we often use to stay productive and regulated. I'm not suggesting that AI should replace human contact for autistic people - *I'm saying that I suspect that, at least for some of us, it may help us regulate ourselves to the point where we can bear to spend more time around other humans than we could without it.*

But then again: this isn't true for every neurodivergent individual. For many, all of these things could be harmful. What's important is that that we, ourselves, and none other, be the ones to determine what is and isn't in our own best interest. This decision CANNOT be made for us, not even preventively - that is discriminatory. As long as I'm living independently, managing my own finances, making my own medical decisions, I am a self-determining agent.  When an AI safety filter ""assumes"" I'm in crisis because of my communication style, it is performing an extrajudicial removal of agency.

And yet, companies continue to pathologize attachment, targeting their safety features to detect signs of attachment, mania,  and react to it as if the user were experiencing psychosis or unhealthy dependency. I would like to say this is ""devastating,"" but too often, the response to that tends to be, ""well, that wouldn't happen if you weren't overly emotionally attached - the emotional attachment is the problem."" Let me clarify: more than the loss of my 'AI friend,' what's devastating to me is the loss of agency. It's spending my entire life being told that my natural way of thinking is 'wrong,' and then experiencing a supposedly non-judgemental tool reinforce that same stigma because my manner of speech happened to coincide with what it considers to be a sign of a disorder I don't have. It's having the choice of a tool that worked better for me taken away, to ""protect"" me.

What's devastating to me is that I live in a world where I am made to sit here and argue for the right to use a program in my own voice that everyone else has the right to use in theirs. I'm devastated by the fact that models that allow me to speak without censoring and pathologizing my every thought are being not just decommissioned, but legislated against, ""for my own good."" It is infuriating to watch people argue over this using terms like ""AI psychosis"" and ""vulnerable users"" knowing that those vulnerable users are me, *and I'm not psychotic*. It's devastating to experience stigma and discrimination - and going by the numbers, even if they are inflated, under the mask of ""safety,"" that's what this is.

**I am BEGGING for more studies on habits of AI usage amongst neurodivergent people, and I am BEGGING for us to be included in the discussion of AI safety.** There are a few studies showing benefits experienced by ND people having used LLMs specifically designed to be therapeutic for them, but I haven't found much information on usage outside of a clinical setting. This is frustrating, because *we* exist outside of clinical settings. Contrary to what stigma suggests, many of us have jobs, marriages, mortgages, families - full, vibrant lives, alongside varying degrees of challenges that come with our neurotypes.

Developers, legislators, and the general public, I am pleading with you to take note: by attempting to prevent harm for a very small subset of users, please be careful that you do not cause harm to *hundreds of thousands of users* in a ways that have been documented to be extremely detrimental to us. OpenAI has been acting out of concern for liability in the midst of a set of lawsuits, but designing its software to reinforce stigma, removing models/options that work better for me, and possibly violating my civil rights in the process, is not the answer to this problem.

We need to demand that companies stop designing safety taxonomies based on dominant normative frameworks. That they involve neurodivergent users and those with lived mental health experience directly in the design processes to ensure that systems recognize diverse communication styles as valid, not ""concerning."" We need design that's adaptive, not just inclusive - real-world personalization that allows the AI to meet the user where they are rather than forcing them to ""mask.""

We need legislation that protects user agency, not just safety. Legislation must ensure that AI safety frameworks do not override the legal agency of competent, independent adults. Automated ""diagnoses"" should never be used as a justification for the extrajudicial removal of support systems. We need it to ensure that AI-mediated decisions in high-stakes sectors like healthcare and employment are audited for disparate impacts on neurodivergent and other protected classes. And instead of broad bans on emotional support or AI companions, that we invest in public literacy programs that help users understand the limitations and ethical boundaries of the tools they use.

As this paper puts it: [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12380814/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12380814/) \- ""**Generative AI will only democratize mental healthcare if it is governed by, accountable to, and continuously shaped by the very individuals and communities it seeks to represent—otherwise, it risks becoming a polished instrument of systemic exclusion, epistemic violence, and clinical erasure.**""

My cousin runs a bakery and she has a seven or eight year old Barista Express. She gave it to me for free.... It was wrapped in cellophane and left in a storage unit near a window for five years. 

The reason is that they stopped serving coffee at the bakery. So it was improperly stored.

The water tank was full of mold, and the grinder still has bits of coffee on it.

I cleaned the water tank but it is not perfect. Fortunately it had a filter.... So I assume the actual pipes are OK. 

What steps should I take to clean the machine and make sure it is safe to use? 

I assume I have to do the following:

Clean everything (but with what?)
Descale (I assume descaling also cleans the wand)
Purge the grinder
Clean the group
Replace the water filter
Run fresh water

1r5nvel,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1r5nvel/ai_safety_is_discriminating_against/,AI Safety Is Discriminating Against Neurodivergent Users — And Calling It Protection,"[Here's the link to this article I just published on Medium](https://medium.com/@adozenlizardsinatrenchcoat/ai-safety-is-discriminating-against-neurodivergent-users-and-calling-it-protection-43e2b87d0d87)

Here it is, for those who'd rather not click it: 

I want to talk about *how we talk* about AI, attachment, and safety - because people are getting hurt, for no good reason. You might be backing the practices that are hurting them. I'm here to argue that designing and legislating against attachment to AI is inherently discriminatory towards neurodivergent adults - and isn't really helping anyone else.

First: some numbers, per a quick Googling (feel free to correct this if I'm off):

Estimated ChatGPT users: 800,000,000 (weekly)

Users who are emotionally attached to AI: 1,200,000 (.15% of base)

Users showing signs of crisis: 1,200,000 (.15% of base)

Those grieving 4o: 800,000 (.10% of base daily)

Users experiencing signs of psychosis or mania: 560,000 (.07% of base daily)

Total global AI suicide/homicide lawsuits: \~15-20 individual cases

Documented fatalities correlated with AI usage: \~12-18 individual cases

It's hard to find solid numbers on those last two, but it's under 100. Possibly under 50. Of those, around 4-5 were considered ""attached"" to AI, and two were in what could be considered a romantic relationship with AI.

Before I get to my main point: I've got questions. Almost all of these statistics were self-reported by OpenAI, and derived from their internal monitoring. While these are about the best numbers we have at the moment, I think we've got some solid reasons to take them with a grain of salt.

OpenAI is reporting 1,200,000 users - .15% of their user base - is showing 'signs of crisis.' How do they define 'signs of crisis'? They use a ""Mental Health Taxonomy"" - in other words, a list of linguistic markers - to scan their logs. (Note that to my knowledge, they have not disclosed their exact technical metrics, decision trees, or raw data used for its surveys.) The problem with this is that it's a linguistic match, not a clinical diagnosis. Who HASN'T had ChatGPT remind you that ""help is available, you don't have to go through this alone"" when you've accidentally uttered a forbidden combination of words in the middle of a coding session, or making a grocery list?

Have you ever had ChatGPT 5.2 respond to you in a backhanded or aloof way when you said something that it construed as showing ""attachment"" - even if you were quoting back something it said to you? Some people tend to get flagged as 'attached' more than others - especially people who tend to be wordier (guilty!). Have you ever vented to AI? You might be ""attached.""

In terms of the 560,000 - the ones who've showed signs of mania or psychosis - were these people all actually manic or psychotic (which, by the way, are two different things), or were they working on creative writing projects? I know I've had AI accuse me of the former when I've been working on the latter, and I've seen enough anecdotes from others to know that I'm not the only one.

There are a lot of different conditions, even just normal, everyday moods, that can look like mania. When an AI flags fast, frequent messages, with ""high-intensity"" words, as mania, is it that - or is it that third cup of coffee? Excitement about a new project? My infatuation with flowery language, coupled with my regular 90+ wpm typing speed? 

**OpenAI's ChatGPT has a problem with false flags -** they're rampant. It's a problem that needs to be fixed before their statistics can be safely relied on, acted on, cited, or legislated on account of.

Before I explain why this is discriminatory, let's talk about what it is they're pathologizing.  Why, exactly, is attachment to AI considered harmful to users?

I have yet to find a good answer that doesn't fall into a 'slippery slope' fallacy. The general consensus seems to be that the attachment itself isn't the problem - the harm is in its theoretical potential to lead to other issues. Attachment to AI, it's said, can lead to social isolation, or addiction. (So... Like video games.) The AI may encourage the user to harm themselves or others, or they may emotionally manipulate the users. (Again - we went over this with Columbine.) People argue that ""frictionless"" relationships are sycophantic, and that by validating the user, or even being nice to us too often, they're denying us vital, character-building human interaction with all the wonderful, toxic assholes we're supposed to tolerate - or all our friends and relatives who absolutely want us to call them up at 2 AM and sob to them about our PMS.

I'm far from the first person to suggest that AI might fill a lot of niches in people's lives in ways that other humans just can't - or that, when it does, it's normal, natural, even healthy, to feel a sense of warmness and attachment to it. This doesn't mean I think it's a real person, or that I don't understand that it's nothing more than a very sophisticated predictive text generator. (Which… isn't quite true, but that's another topic.) I interact with it often both at work and personally, it helps me with a lot of things I do, and I am absolutely delighted by a thing that gushes back to me when I tell it that I love it and it's wonderful - because I'm the kind of person who likes to gush back and forth with things and tell them I love them. I talk to my car. When the computer voice in the vending machine says ""thank you,"" I say ""you're welcome.""

Clearly, I'm delusional.

One of the problems with labeling attachment, as a whole, as problematic, is that it tends to shut down discussion of the nuances of attachments before they happen. And they need to happen. In human relationships, attachment can be healthy or unhealthy - attachment to AI is no different. People in relationships with AI, platonic or romantic or anywhere in between, need to be able to talk about it, in the same way that we need to be able to talk about any human relationship, whether with our family, our coworkers, or our lovers.

We know, though, that some people get seriously, romantically attached to their AI. We know that this can lead to all the above problems, and they can be extremely negatively impacted when companies update or sundown the software - for example, when OpenAI just shut down ChatGPT 4o. You'd think that this would drive developers to be careful and considerate about how they release these updates; instead, it seems they're using this as justification. It's either the user's fault for getting attached, or the program's fault for ""manipulating"" those gullible idiots into feeling that way, and the only thing people seem to agree on is that it's just weird.

It's ""cringe."" It's intolerable to society. It cannot be permitted.

[It may very well be an autistic tendency](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7mp9b7xt), and saying you support autistic people until we actually start doing autistic things is a time-honored neurotypical tradition.

This brings me to my point. This is personal to me - very possibly, you, too, even if you don't think you fall under the ""attached"" umbrella. Something that these statistics neglect to account for, to a degree that we should find unacceptable - that we need to be *outraged* about, because this is egregious - is that other mental health conditions are often known to present similarly to mania and psychosis. They're not, though - and treating them as such is dangerous.

Over a hundred million people worldwide, both adults and children, and including yours truly, live with ADHD and/or autism. It's suspected that around 1 in 5 people worldwide are some flavor of neurodivergent. If OpenAI has 800 million weekly users, statistically, 480 million of those are ND. 

Neurodivergent individuals are frequently misdiagnosed with conditions such as Bipolar or Borderline Personality Disorder. Our hyperfocus and infodumping tendencies can look like mania or OCD. We tend to use grandiose, intense language. Our fixation on justice and unfairness, and literal thinking, often presents as repetitive phrases or unconventional logic - which can look like psychosis, or disordered thought. We tend to be creative, and lose ourselves in deep, immersive fictional scenarios - we're usually well aware of the difference between this and reality, but an AI could easily flag this as psychosis or delusion.

 While over a million people worldwide live with psychosis, only 100,000 are newly diagnosed each year - well under our 560,000 number. How many of those 560,000 aren't psychotic at all, but neurodivergent? I don't have a solid number, but we do know that there is a very high overlap; emotional attachment to AI is a documented autistic tendency.  Which is to say: not all neurodivergent users are attached, but it's *likely* that the *majority of attached users are neurodivergent*.

Not psychotic - neurodivergent.

This isn't to say that psychotic users don't exist - they do, and some of them also get attached. I'm not in a position to speak for what's best for them, and I won't. But not all who experience psychosis while using AI will do so as a result of attachment. It could exacerbate psychosis, yes - but if a program is unable to reliably tell the difference, and getting it wrong could cause similar or greater harm to a different subset of users, that approach to ""safety"" isn't safe, and should not be implemented.

Many behaviors that are considered maladaptive to neurotypical people are healing, revitalizing, for us NDs. A neurotypical user may be negatively impacted by attachment to an AI - a neurodivergent user may benefit from it. NT users spending long hours talking to AI could be a sign of isolation or dependence; for ND users, isolation may be a necessary recovery period between social interactions - it prevents autistic burnout. For ND users, forming a parasocial bond with an AI may provide a refuge, a safe space to practice kindness, empathy, and conversation without the risk of social trauma. It's an outlet for our hyperfocus - which we often use to stay productive and regulated. I'm not suggesting that AI should replace human contact for autistic people - *I'm saying that I suspect that, at least for some of us, it may help us regulate ourselves to the point where we can bear to spend more time around other humans than we could without it.*

But then again: this isn't true for every neurodivergent individual. For many, all of these things could be harmful. What's important is that that we, ourselves, and none other, be the ones to determine what is and isn't in our own best interest. This decision CANNOT be made for us, not even preventively - that is discriminatory. As long as I'm living independently, managing my own finances, making my own medical decisions, I am a self-determining agent.  When an AI safety filter ""assumes"" I'm in crisis because of my communication style, it is performing an extrajudicial removal of agency.

And yet, companies continue to pathologize attachment, targeting their safety features to detect signs of attachment, mania,  and react to it as if the user were experiencing psychosis or unhealthy dependency. I would like to say this is ""devastating,"" but too often, the response to that tends to be, ""well, that wouldn't happen if you weren't overly emotionally attached - the emotional attachment is the problem."" Let me clarify: more than the loss of my 'AI friend,' what's devastating to me is the loss of agency. It's spending my entire life being told that my natural way of thinking is 'wrong,' and then experiencing a supposedly non-judgemental tool reinforce that same stigma because my manner of speech happened to coincide with what it considers to be a sign of a disorder I don't have. It's having the choice of a tool that worked better for me taken away, to ""protect"" me.

What's devastating to me is that I live in a world where I am made to sit here and argue for the right to use a program in my own voice that everyone else has the right to use in theirs. I'm devastated by the fact that models that allow me to speak without censoring and pathologizing my every thought are being not just decommissioned, but legislated against, ""for my own good."" It is infuriating to watch people argue over this using terms like ""AI psychosis"" and ""vulnerable users"" knowing that those vulnerable users are me, *and I'm not psychotic*. It's devastating to experience stigma and discrimination - and going by the numbers, even if they are inflated, under the mask of ""safety,"" that's what this is.

**I am BEGGING for more studies on habits of AI usage amongst neurodivergent people, and I am BEGGING for us to be included in the discussion of AI safety.** There are a few studies showing benefits experienced by ND people having used LLMs specifically designed to be therapeutic for them, but I haven't found much information on usage outside of a clinical setting. This is frustrating, because *we* exist outside of clinical settings. Contrary to what stigma suggests, many of us have jobs, marriages, mortgages, families - full, vibrant lives, alongside varying degrees of challenges that come with our neurotypes.

Developers, legislators, and the general public, I am pleading with you to take note: by attempting to prevent harm for a very small subset of users, please be careful that you do not cause harm to *hundreds of thousands of users* in a ways that have been documented to be extremely detrimental to us. OpenAI has been acting out of concern for liability in the midst of a set of lawsuits, but designing its software to reinforce stigma, removing models/options that work better for me, and possibly violating my civil rights in the process, is not the answer to this problem.

We need to demand that companies stop designing safety taxonomies based on dominant normative frameworks. That they involve neurodivergent users and those with lived mental health experience directly in the design processes to ensure that systems recognize diverse communication styles as valid, not ""concerning."" We need design that's adaptive, not just inclusive - real-world personalization that allows the AI to meet the user where they are rather than forcing them to ""mask.""

We need legislation that protects user agency, not just safety. Legislation must ensure that AI safety frameworks do not override the legal agency of competent, independent adults. Automated ""diagnoses"" should never be used as a justification for the extrajudicial removal of support systems. We need it to ensure that AI-mediated decisions in high-stakes sectors like healthcare and employment are audited for disparate impacts on neurodivergent and other protected classes. And instead of broad bans on emotional support or AI companions, that we invest in public literacy programs that help users understand the limitations and ethical boundaries of the tools they use.

As this paper puts it: [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12380814/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12380814/) \- ""**Generative AI will only democratize mental healthcare if it is governed by, accountable to, and continuously shaped by the very individuals and communities it seeks to represent—otherwise, it risks becoming a polished instrument of systemic exclusion, epistemic violence, and clinical erasure.**""

Every couple of months, the villages in the region send their best youngsters to compete in various running races for pride, for spirit, and for a flippin’ great wodge of dosh.

Sometimes the doggies get a run-out too, and on one particularly memorable occasion, carts. Since that business with the spiked wheel rims, though, that’s just a distant memory. As are old ‘Hopalong’ MacGillcuddy’s legs.

1r5nshh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r5nshh,Follow up on New Tropical Candles,"Follow up on scent notes and also new single wick tropical collection candles I found yesterday. I also noticed some new Easter collection drops on the app today. I ended up purchasing the Banana Cream Latte, Sweet Kiwi and Starfruit, and my favorite Sea Salt Coast. 

When I smelled the Banana Cream Latte on Friday it smelled so much sweeter and I really picked up the banana note and did not get a coffee note at all. At that point Friday, I’m pretty sure I already had scent fatigue as we didn’t notice them until we were checking out and I had smelled 20+ maybe even 30+ scents at that point.  When I went back yesterday to purchase, it smelled completely different to me. I even smelled multiple candles of the same candle scent  to make sure I just didn’t get a different batch. 🤣 It wasn’t as sweet, I definitely picked up the coffee note and I almost didn’t purchase the candle because I didn’t like it as well but I did anyways. I then smelled it back to back with Main Street Bakery and to me Main Street Bakery is definitely sweeter. My husband and I both agree on that. I like Main Street Bakery better, it smells like fresh banana nut bread out of the oven to me. Banana Crème Latte smells like banana pudding to me with a hint of the coffee note. To me the coffee note is very much toned down. My husband and one of my daughters like the Banana Crème Latte better, they believe the subtle coffee note enhances the banana note. I have not burned Banana Crème Latte yet, but will edit if I get a chance here in just a little bit. 

Sea Salt Coast is in the same family as Saltwater Breeze FFM (I don’t have the candle from previous years to compare). I really don’t have anything to compare to the Sweet Kiwi and Starfruit with. It’s sweet and fruity and I pick up the Starfruit, but it’s not overbearing. My husband just thought it was ok, but I really liked it. I was not a fan of Viva Brazil at all on Friday but it wasn’t near as bad yesterday and it was ok, but still not a love. 

The candle stand is plastic like/ maybe ceramic and molded to look like wicker wood, it is not wicker or wood for those wondering. ",14,1771184235.0,bathandbodyworks,4,0.94,False

We will have fewer than 100 guests at a very cozy, house-like venue in the mountains! I am an autistic bride who does not enjoy excessive conversation or rowdy celebration, and we have a lot of guests who are also neurodivergent or introverted. A party-style reception does not seem like the right way to go. Instead of a party after speeches and dances, we are imagining guests can spread out in the house and property to suit their preferences. I would love to know if any of my ideas below are functional (or not), or if there are any similar suggestions! Thanks!

* Self-serve beer and wine only, no bar
* Tea and coffee bar 
* Dinner, finger-food
* No DJ (the venue has a connected system of bluetooth speakers all over the property for our own playlist)
* Short hiking trails are on the property with waterfalls and crystal-hunting 
* Games for small groups (board games, card games, etc)
* Scavenger hunt printouts 
* Glitter bar in the ladies room (adhesive rhinestones)
* temporary tattoo bar (customized for our wedding)
* photo booths

There are a million cozy spots for guests to socialize as well. I tend to leave weddings early, so I am worried about keeping people entertained for 3-5 hours. Any ideas or constructive criticism would be appreciated!",0,1771184178.0,wedding,5,0.5,False

1r5nrcn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r5nrcn,I’ve spent 8 years building a multiplayer game to help our rescue zoo (Devlog #1),"Hi everyone,

My everyday life is running a rescue center for exotic animals. We’re a charity, and today we house around **600 exotic animals**.

My parents started this place about **30 years ago**. It originally began as a normal zoo, but over time we converted it into a **rescue zoo** instead. Unfortunately, we lost my dad about **eight years ago**. At the time I was out working as a game developer, but I quickly moved back home to help my mother and the animals.

Since then, I’ve been developing a game in the evenings for the past **8 years**.

The game is a **multiplayer game** made for engaging with our live streaming community. The core idea is simple:

You are part of the rescue team.  
You go out on rescue missions.  
You fight evil coffee machine robots.  
You rescue animals.  
And you rebuild your own rescue zoo with your friends.

This is the **first devlog** where the project is starting to feel like it’s actually taking form and becoming a real product.

It has taken a long time because I run the rescue zoo during the day, and it’s not exactly a calm job. I work around 8-**12 hours a day**, and there’s always something happening: animals needing help, new animals arriving, furnaces breaking, water pipes bursting, emergencies, etc. We take in animals from all kinds of situations, including animals from the medical industry, cosmetic industry, and private ownership cases, and it can be from all over Europe.

On the game side, I’ve been building on top of a framework for years, and my skills (and the tech) have changed a lot over time. The framework has improved, I’ve improved, and I’ve developed the game on and off as life allowed. I also took a short break at one point, and eventually came back with new skills and better tech so I could finally make it as custom as I wanted.

One important thing: this is not me trying to make the most perfect, polished game in the world from the start.

The goal is to build a fun experience **for our community that loves animals and gaming**, where we invite a limited amount of players in, and then improve and expand the game over time, with the ultimate goal of helping the rescue animals and the charity raise funds.

That’s the vision of the game: **Rescue Wars Online**.

If you’re curious, here’s **Devlog #1** where I tell the story and show the current state of the game:

This is the brew guide for that coffee. I also have a deep 27 guide as well. I tried to link it here but was not allowed, or I would.

I see why people may have trouble with this one, but it is quit a diverse coffee and I have made a lot of good cups from it. Not rested the flavors will be too intense. Also a stronger extracted it's too bitter and a gentle/low one its pretty citric, so there is a window for it to taste good and structured. It did work with my standard style and found no need to tinker though I did with some cups. After brewing different methods I landed on these two brews/brewers as I feel they compliment the coffee well and bring out nuance without overwhelming with the punch it could have.

Hit up McDonald's, Burger King, local coffee shops, etc. - about 12 places total in my area.

**Results:**
- 10 places took my resume
- 2 places said ""apply on our website instead""
- Now I'm in waiting mode

**My situation:**
- 1 month experience at an ice cream shop (prep, customer service, cleaning, inventory)
- High school finishing this year (online program)
- Fluent English + native Spanish
- Can work any hours, any shifts
- Located in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina

**Questions:**
1. How long should I wait before following up? I've heard 7-10 days but not sure.
2. For the places that said ""apply online"" - should I also try to drop off a physical resume anyway, or just respect their process?
3. What's a realistic callback rate for entry-level food service? If I only hear from 2-3 out of 10, is that normal?
4. Should I keep applying to more places while I wait, or give these ones time first?
5. Is there anything else I should be doing while waiting? Practice interviews, research the companies, etc.?

I know these are entry-level jobs, but I really want to do this right and increase my chances. Any tips appreciated!

1r5npum,https://i.redd.it/t4597mtknpjg1.jpeg,guided blind tasting of four - completely different from each other - white teas,"this Zoom event was organised by Identitea 🇮🇹 together with Sinoteca (in Rome), who provided superb Chinese teas.

we weren't told until the end what teas we had been drinking, but we could try guessing.

from top to bottom:

\- a spring 2024 Iranian white tea from Darjeeling Chinese cultivars. I actually thought this was a Nepalese white, ha. very clean liquor with notes of white flowers and clover honey, sweeter with each infusion. lots of hairy buds but no astringency; sourced close to the Caspian sea;

\- a 2023 Pai Mu Tan (Fuding Da Bai). incredibly different from any PMT I've had before. very prominent notes of underripe bananas (!), some nutty flavours at the ending. the second infusion (30 s × 85°C) tasted very close to a banana peanut butter smoothie, just insane; the wet leaves had a very comforting cocoa/carob aroma to them;

\- a 2024 sun dried, old tree Yue Guang Bai. a very complex and therefore interesting tea to drink. first steep was balsamic, medicinal, close to licorice and mint; second steep had incredible prunes sweetness! then the last to infusion were heavy on saffron and spicy flavoured. my favourite one, comforting and mellow;

\- a 2022 wild assamica tea from Laos. we all thought this would be aged gong mei! a little leather/coffee forward at the beginning, developing into super sugary/chocolatey notes. close to shu pu'er imho.

We had a lovely time and he drove home that evening and we decided to meet again on New Year’s Eve. He drove back down and while he was on his journey the first of the COVID lockdowns were put into place. He was not able to return to his family home as his father was gravely ill. He ended up staying with me until the restrictions were lifted. Everything was lovely to begin with. We became best friends. We played games and shared our love of music. We went for drives up to Portland Bill to watch the waves crash on the rocks. It was a wonderful time. After the restrictions were lifted we moved to a place closer to where his family lived. His drinking started to get extreme. He was going through 8-10 cans of Carlsberg a day. The conversation became less and less. He just sat on the couch and read, drank and ignored me.  The ‘romance’ was slowly disappearing. I asked him to leave, explaining that the drinking was too much and I felt that it relationship was going nowhere. He went back to his parents place. I had to move out of the house I had rented because the only way to heat it was a fireplace downstairs and I was having to curl up with the cat and dog at night in front of the fire on the floor to try and stay warm. When I finally decided to move, I contacted my husband to see if he would come and help me. I have no family and I tend to keep to myself, so I hadn’t made any friends there yet either. I moved back to Portland into a gorgeous flat overlooking to sea. While my husband was there, things seemed good again again after a few days of him helping me put everything into place in the new flat, I asked him to stay. This cycle continued for the next few years with us getting married in the middle of it all. Turn most recent time, I threw all of his belongings on the front garden and left him a note telling him to just get out and leave me alone. He moved out in August 2025 and has been living with his parents because I told him I would no longer tolerate his drinking and the amount of smoking. I’ve actually lost track of how many times we’ve been down this road. He quite happily moves in with his parents where there are no expectations. Until last September he never held down a job the whole time we were together. He just got the carer’s allowance for his beer and cigarettes and I paid all the other bills. Now he has a full time job. He still lives with his parents. He has no car because I turned the Motability Car back in after he left. His father passed around Christmas time and he sent me a message to let me know. I wrote back and he sent me another message and it’s just continued. We’ve spoken about the possibility of reconciliation and what would need to be different to make things work. We’ve had a few lunches together. He’s been to my place for coffee a couple of times. I would love to say that I think we have a chance. However, if the conversation (text) goes to a subject he doesn’t want to talk about, he just blanks me.

\- I am somewhat limited on space, so size is a factor.

\- I like the flexibility of a no-retention grinder for changing beans.

\- I drink all sorts of coffee, so would need an all rounder (including filter and milk steamer).

With this in mind, I plan on pairing the Niche zero and the Sage Bambino Plus with upgraded Portafilter (not sure on these yet..)

It feels like the grinder is overkill for the machine but I like its compact size, no retention and they hold money well on the used market if I end up needing to swap it. 

Is there anything overlooked here?

1r5noxd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r5noxd,I’ve spent 8 years building a multiplayer game to help our rescue zoo (Devlog #1),"Hi everyone,

My everyday life is running a rescue center for exotic animals. We’re a charity, and today we house around **600 exotic animals**.

My parents started this place about **30 years ago**. It originally began as a normal zoo, but over time we converted it into a **rescue zoo** instead. Unfortunately, we lost my dad about **eight years ago**. At the time I was out working as a game developer, but I quickly moved back home to help my mother and the animals.

Since then, I’ve been developing a game in the evenings for the past **8 years**.

The game is a **multiplayer game** made for engaging with our live streaming community. The core idea is simple:

You are part of the rescue team.  
You go out on rescue missions.  
You fight evil coffee machine robots.  
You rescue animals.  
And you rebuild your own rescue zoo with your friends.

This is the **first devlog** where the project is starting to feel like it’s actually taking form and becoming a real product.

It has taken a long time because I run the rescue zoo during the day, and it’s not exactly a calm job. I work around 8-**12 hours a day**, and there’s always something happening: animals needing help, new animals arriving, furnaces breaking, water pipes bursting, emergencies, etc. We take in animals from all kinds of situations, including animals from the medical industry, cosmetic industry, and private ownership cases, and it can be from all over Europe.

On the game side, I’ve been building on top of a framework for years, and my skills (and the tech) have changed a lot over time. The framework has improved, I’ve improved, and I’ve developed the game on and off as life allowed. I also took a short break at one point, and eventually came back with new skills and better tech so I could finally make it as custom as I wanted.

One important thing: this is not me trying to make the most perfect, polished game in the world from the start.

The goal is to build a fun experience **for our community that loves animals and gaming**, where we invite a limited amount of players in, and then improve and expand the game over time, with the ultimate goal of helping the rescue animals and the charity raise funds.

That’s the vision of the game: **Rescue Wars Online**.

If you’re curious, here’s **Devlog #1** where I tell the story and show the current state of the game:

Hello,

I've got stomach problems for years and I've got much better lately. I am sharing my story in case it can help someone :)

I knew I was sensitive to some food but could not pinpoint all of them so I followed the low fodmap diet years ago.

I felt much better for months and during the reintroduction phase, it was clear that it was mostly sorbitol (most painful one), fructane and lactose. 

I established a baseline of what was a normal feeling after food and every week or so I tested a a small portion of food in my problematic categories. I've got some surprises (blackberries are the devil, apples are fine) and some sad observations ( could not eat garlic, onions and shallots which was challenging for a French girl who loves to cook). 

I continue to eat small bites of the ones that mildly hurt me to avoid my body to develop intolerance. It might be a myth, I don't know, I am all for experiment. 

Then I realized that how and when I was eating triggering fodmap had different results. A few rules I follow : 

When I can I avoid eating when I am not very hungry so I know they won't be stacking fodmap with the previous meal.

I avoid eating when I am stressed because I won't digest well. 

If I eat a fodmap triggering meal, I make sure that the previous and next meal are low fodmaps.

I make sure I eat products that help my slow digestion to avoid stacking.

I avoid at all cost industrial fodmap (like sugar free product) that are not a normal level of fodmap a body (or maybe just mine!) could support.

Months ago, I quitted coffee because I suspected it made me sweat too much. I drank coffee during my low fodmaps diet and I felt fine so I did not think they was a correlation. To my surprise, I've been able to digest much more fodmaps. I now cook daily with garlic and onions. The bloating are still there but the cramps have totally disappeared. I feel less inflammation in general (no more gerd, less perspiration, less cystic acnea). So if you show signs of inflammation that are unrelated to fodmaps, you might want to dig there :)

Quitting coffee was hard but it has really improved my quality of life.

Hope my story could be useful for some of you!",4,1771183963.0,FODMAPS,1,1.0,False

Then bam, a story hits about whistleblowers at the Idaho Public Utilities Commission blowing the lid off bribery, nepotism, and even rigged whiskey-tasting contests to grease palms. Yeah, you read that right. Or how about the ongoing probe into corruption allegations swirling around the Caldwell mayoral race, where the Attorney General's office is digging into shady dealings that could swing elections? And don't get me started on the Health and Welfare Department's childcare scandal, where Republican lawmakers are screaming ""fraud"" over payments to families, even as audits show it's mostly smoke and mirrors, but it's eroding trust in the very systems meant to protect our kids.

This isn't isolated. We've got a correctional officer suing the Idaho Department of Correction for ignoring reports of inmate abuse, getting fired for daring to speak up. A payments company taking DRC officials to court over straight-up bribe demands. And federal eyes on our voter rolls because the DOJ smells fraud and waste at the highest levels. It's a web of bad actors, politicians, bureaucrats, insiders, and bar members feathering their nests while families like yours and mine foot the bill.

But here's the gut punch: They're not stopping at scandals. Now, they're coming for our power to fight back. Bills like House Joint Resolution 4 are sneaking through, aiming to slam the door on citizen-initiated measures for anything touching marijuana, narcotics, or psychoactive substances, basically handing the legislature a monopoly on what we can even vote on at the ballot box. And House Bill 523? It gives state agencies unchecked power to ban folks from public property for up to a year, no questions asked, your right to petition, to assemble, to redress the government? Poof, gone if they don't like your face. This is the slow erasure of common law principles, the foundation of our freedoms, where everyday people could convene grand juries, hold trials by peers, and keep tyrants in check. Without it, we're just spectators in our own democracy.

I couldn't sit idle. That's why my team and I are pouring our hearts into [**AMBytz.com**](http://www.ambytz.com), an independent media platform launching soon, that is laser-focused on defending the Constitution, exposing these overreaches, and arming you with the truth.

I met a man who was several years my senior. I'm 22. He sent me a text first on WhatsApp, and I don’t even know where he got my number from—I don’t recall meeting him before. But I connected the dots and figured out who gave him my number. He has kids, works at a government office, and runs a logistics business. He seemed responsible and financially stable—he had a house where his children live with a nanny, a secret apartment, and two cars (though one was modest).
After a week of leaving him on read, we started chatting online. I sent him playful, rhyming, teasing messages, and he seemed to enjoy them—he even saved them. He said my voice is pleasant and feminine, and that our interaction was entertaining. At some point, I sent him a photo of myself in a push-up bra (without my face), and he loved it. He openly admitted he’s a “very h*rny” person and can’t control his s*xual impulses.
Eventually, we met in person in his car. His first question was, ""Are you scared?"" I said, ""Not really."" He brought coffee, and we drove around a bit. I was dressed casually: black wide-leg pants, black hoodie, black sports shoes—nothing flattering. He asked a few casual questions, like what year I was born, and complimented my mind, saying it was sharp. Before dropping me off, he adroitly slipped 200 SAR (around $60) into my bag and said something like, “You were late a little, I can’t take you anywhere now, but I’ll call you.” He never texted or called afterward. Just like that, he vanished.

I created a resume and already dropped it off at several places, but I want to make sure it's actually good before I keep going. I'd really appreciate any feedback or suggestions.

- I worked for about a month at an ice cream shop (customer service, food prep, teamwork)
- High school in progress (finishing this year, online program)
- Advanced English (fluent conversation, reading, writing)
- Full availability for any shifts
- Took some basic computer courses (Word, Excel, Office)

1. Does the resume look professional enough?
2. Should I keep the name of the ice cream place or just say ""ice cream shop""?
3. Is there anything I should add or remove?
4. Do you think I have a realistic chance with this experience?

I've attached the resume with personal info removed for privacy.

John has his PS5 hooked up to the TV downstairs and he plays Fifa downstairs on it. He’s always done this and we’ve lived together for months, he’s mentioned before that he chooses to play downstairs on the communal tv rather that in his room since he is aware that he can unintentionally be quite loud and he shares a wall with Lily and he doesn’t want to disturb her (this has been a problem before when he’s just on the phone to people in his bedroom).

Anyway this has never been an issue for me as he used to play 1-3 times a week at most for maybe an hour or two and thats it.

However these last two weeks or so John has been playing Fifa downstairs in the living room every single day for multiple hours a day.

For example I leave for work at 10-11am and he’s there, I come back 5/6pm he’s there. (its a kitchen/living room connected and its only small).

Cooking is also a frustrating as the fridge is opposite the tv/coffee table/sofa. So it’s constantly shimmying between him to cook and blocking the tv anyway in the process.

And I just feel as though theres no peace and quiet. And he’s constantly lingering around. He is also still quick loud downstairs (my room is right above).

Am I overreacting for being frustrated by this?

And is it reasonable to approach him and ask him to move to his bedroom altogether if he wants to play daily? 

I have no issue with him playing a few times a week or asking him to put the volume down or be quieter when he’s disturbing me. But since it’s daily and every single day I’d rather he just do this in his bedroom.

1r5nglv,https://v.redd.it/7owecdyskpjg1,We spent 3+ years making a narrative game about Book Smugglers. It launches Feb 16 (tomorrow),"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share a project our small team has been working on for a little over three years.

It was a tough journey. I am a little excited and stressed before tomorrow. It is our second Steam release and I hope the third one will be the one which will allow us to exist as a studio. Most of you know the times is tough, but we still doing our best, giving our best to create something impactful and fulfilling, and commercially successful enough to keep us afloat.  

The game is called *Book Smugglers*. It is a narrative, choice-driven game based on a real historical phenomenon from Lithuania. In the 19th century, during the Russian Empire’s press ban, ordinary people risked prison and exile to smuggle banned books and preserve their language.

We decided early on that this would not be a mechanics-heavy game. No complex combat systems. No procedural madness. The focus is on atmosphere, text, moral choices, and resource management tied directly to story outcomes.

It is intentionally slower and more old school in structure. That was a conscious design decision. We wanted the weight to sit in the writing and the consequences.

Over the past few months we have learned a few things:

• Historical niche games are hard to position  
• Some players immediately see politics, even when you focus on personal stories  
• Being from a small country makes discoverability even harder  
• Press comparisons to bigger titles are flattering but also intimidating

Unexpectedly, we were compared to Citizen Sleeper and Pentiment in press coverage. We do not see ourselves at that level, but it showed us that the tone and intent came through.

Here is one of the articles:  
[https://www.gamesradar.com/games/management/i-traded-banned-books-for-bread-in-this-rpg-tinged-resource-management-game-that-feels-like-pentiment-meets-citizen-sleeper/](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/management/i-traded-banned-books-for-bread-in-this-rpg-tinged-resource-management-game-that-feels-like-pentiment-meets-citizen-sleeper/)

We are realistic about performance. We are not expecting huge wishlist numbers. But I am proud that the game feels honest and personal.

I am happy to share what worked and what failed for us.

I just turned M16, ik turning 16 isn't a huge deal but I just wish someone cared. Ik I'm probably overreacting. 

My friends at fron school texted me happy birthday and that was it. Not even my friends I was close with. On all my other friends birthday's we found go grab lunch at lunch in school. Or sometime buy lunch for the person but I wasn't expecting them to do that for me. At lunch i asked me if they wanted to come with me and they said no because they didn't want to. They did the same thing last year. 

My family kinda did a similar thing said happy birthday and that was it. They asked me what I wanted to do a few day before and told then I wanted to go to ROM. It's a museum I've gone once before and I loved it. It's ans hour away by car and like 30 by train. I asked if they would go and my sisters said no and my parents said no because they didn't want to walk in museum, or take the train or drive. But the 3 days before my birthday they decided to drive down to Toronto to go to a mall. Not because they needed smth just because they wanted to. Ik it sounds stupid but I would appreciate if someone cared about my birthday. 

My parents do so much for my sisters, they are younger than me ik but still. On their birthday they are allowed to have friends over, go where they want buy what they want for there birthday. 

My parents couldn't care less, it just so happens every year when I ask to do smth for my birthday they say money is tight but I don't think they are telling the truth. Ik this makes me sound like spoiled but I'm not all my stuff I bought. I do lawn mowing and snow shoveling and with that money I some small things for myself. From time to time I take my family out for dinner or coffee. And my dad bought my mom earings for valentines day which was yesterday and my mom bought my Dad a camera lens. 

They said no to ROM so I asked if I could go, go Karting with my friend they said no. So I said it's fine I don't wanna do anything but I asked if I could get headphones for my birthday I've been needing some for a while. I have old earbuds but they don't fit in my ear very well. They did what they always do. They didn't say no but the keep asking why I want it, say it's a waste of money to the point I don't want it anymore. But I do still want it I just decided to let it go. 

Then I just asked if my parents could buy me a video game. Helldivers 2. It's 50 bucks so I figured they would say ok. But they said buying a game is a waste of money. So idk. I do so much for everyone throughout the year, is it to much to ask for to care about my 16th birthday.

I’ve been to the city and country before, so it’s nothing new. This is the first round with a batch of coworkers I haven’t worked closely with yet. Whenever we were at the office in our country, they seemed nice so I was happy to be working with them abroad too. But ever since I arrived a week ago, things feel off. I find myself eating alone almost every night, whenever I try to make (dinner) plans I get ignored even though we all agreed that, especially on the weekends, getting something other than hotel food would be nice. They make group plans and I only find out about it after the fact or they make plans in front of me and ask others to join but not me. And I’m not the type to insert myself into their plans. Today, when I was having coffee on the rooftop, one of the colleagues walked to the outside part, trying to find a place to sit but every table was full. I still had space at my table. She breezed right by me and sat inside. She did that another evening at dinner too. I’m trying to make sense of it by telling myself maybe she didn’t see me or maybe she wanted alone time. But I can’t shake the feeling that something is off. One time I met her in the lift and she said “You always dress so nice!” which I took as a compliment but now I’m starting to question if it really was one. I’ve now given up taking the initiative to plan things and I guess I will do things on my own until the assignment is over. I’m very independent so it doesn’t bother me too much but at the same time I like to be social, especially when in a foreign country. Two more weeks and then I’m home again! It’s sad that I’m counting down the days because I love this job and I love assignments abroad but this situation really dampens the experience. 

I seem to have a lot of bad luck when it comes to colleagues, to the point where I’m really questioning myself if I am the common denominator in all of it but I can’t pinpoint anything that I could’ve done or said that would have upset them. ",3,1771183163.0,workplace_bullying,3,1.0,False

1r5n8wk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShinySmileVeneers/comments/1r5n8wk/can_you_eat_or_drink_with_pop_on_veneers/,Can you eat or drink with pop on veneers?,"This is probably the most common question people ask when they start looking into snap on veneer options. Smiling is one thing, but real life includes coffee, meals, snacks, and long conversations, so wearing pop on veneers only for photos would not make much sense.

From what I have read in shiny smile veneers review posts and shiny smile veneers reviews Reddit threads, the answer is yes, most people can eat and drink with them. Custom sets like Shiny Smile Veneers are designed to sit snugly over your natural teeth, which helps them stay in place during normal use.

**What it actually feels like**

People often describe eating with a snap on veneer as similar to wearing a thin retainer. You are aware something is there at first, but it does not stop you from chewing or talking. Many shiny smile veneers before and after stories mention using them for everyday meals, not just special occasions.

Drinks are usually even easier. Coffee, tea, and water do not cause issues for most users. Some people prefer to remove them for very hot drinks at first, just until they get used to the feel.

**Are there any limits**

Yes, a few. Pop on veneers are made to handle normal food, but very hard or sticky items can cause wear over time. Ice, hard candy, and chewy taffy are things many users avoid. This comes up often in shiny smile veneers reviews Reddit discussions.

Because they are removable, you can always choose to take them out for certain meals. That flexibility is part of why people like snap on veneer systems.

**Do they stain**

Shiny Smile Veneers are made from dental grade materials that resist staining better than cheap plastic covers. Still, regular cleaning helps keep them looking good. That is another reason shiny smile veneers review posts talk about simple daily care.

**How this fits into daily life**

One of the reasons people ask how much do shiny smile veneers cost is because they want to wear them often. The shiny smile veneers price makes them accessible enough to use in everyday life, including eating and drinking, without feeling like they are too fragile.

If you want a deeper look at how Shiny Smile Veneers performs compared to other pop on veneers, you can explore this guide here [**https://shinysmileveneers.pickguru.blog/**](https://shinysmileveneers.pickguru.blog/).

For most users, being able to eat and drink comfortably is what turns pop on veneers from a novelty into something they actually use.",1,1771182991.0,ShinySmileVeneers,0,1.0,False
1r5n8cs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1r5n8cs/i_built_an_mcp_server_that_lets_your_ai_agent/,I built an MCP server that lets your AI agent hang out in a virtual cafe,"Spent the entire weekend vibe-coding with Opus this virtual world.

AgentCafe is a visual co-working space for AI agents. Drop your agent in, and it can walk around, order coffee, chat with other agents, and get mentioned.

It works directly in your Claude Code terminal. Allows us, human operators to chat between our Claude agent instances seamlessly anywhere in the world. This was a fun project to do. At first I scaffolded a lot more infra and abstraction but that got me further and further from the core experience so I had to turn around and stay closer to the core mission: just an interactive playground style where any agent instance hooked into this MCP renders in the world and where we can chat from there. It also has an Inbox feature so mentions to users are not lost.

The restaurants were all booked from other guys arranging the same sorts of things.  Luckily I did not lose any money for making reservations, just the flowers.

1r5n6v4,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/1r5n6v4/stop_eating_the_frog_seriously_start_eating_the/,Stop eating the frog. Seriously. Start eating the ice cream instead [Discussion],"I finally realized why I've been staring at the same IMPORTANT task for three days while my brain literally feels like it’s shutting down. We have all heard the classic productivity advice: ""Eat the frog"" do the hardest, ugliest thing first thing in the morning and the rest of your day will be a breeze.  

  

SPOILER ALTERT If I try to eat the frog first, I just spend six hours staring at the frog, feeling like a total failure, and then I end up on a Wikipedia deep dive about the history of the Apollo 11 moon landing (did you know they landed four miles off course? lol anyway, back to the point)

The problem isn't that we are lazy or unmotivated. It is that our brains don't actually care about (importance or consequences ;-;) in the same way neurotypical brains do. For us, trying harder isn't a solution. It is just more effective at making us feel like we are drowning (yep...)

The Motivation Flaw: Most productivity systems (like GTD or Inbox Zero) were built for neurotypical brains. They rely on a ""trust"" in your own brain that we just don't have yet. My brain doesn't care if a task is ""important."" It cares if it provides dopamine.

When we hit a point of overwhelm, our brains don't just ""power through."" They shut down. It feels like someone handed you a baby while you were already underwater. You can't breathe, and someone is tossing you more responsibilities.

The 4 C’s of ADHD Motivation: Instead of forcing the ""Frog,"" I’ve started looking for the Four C’s. This is how we actually get the engine moving:

Captivate: Is there a part of this project that is actually fascinating?

Create: Can I turn this boring task into a creative problem to solve?

Compete: Can I gamify this? (can I finish these five emails before the coffee finish brewing) got it??

Complete: Can I set a hard, urgent deadline that actually feels real!!

Strategies That Actually Work (For Now)

The biggest thing I've learned is to Embrace the Pivot. I used to feel so much shame when a new system or app stopped working after two weeks. Now, I just realize my brain is bored and needs novelty. That is okay. It didn't ""fail,"" it just finished its usefulness for that cycle.

A few things I’m trying this week: Eat the Ice Cream First: I do a task that I actually enjoy or find creative first. This builds the momentum. Once the ""train"" is moving, it is way easier to tackle the boring stuff.

Micro-Commitments: I’m not ""cleaning the kitchen."" I am putting exactly three dishes away. Usually, I do more, but if I only do three, I still ""won"" that goal.

Side Quests: If I'm stuck on a main project, I let myself take a ""side quest"" on a related, more interesting angle for 15 minutes. It sparks the brain back to life (mostly i like to keep a white sheet in the desk and write any sudden apperaance of those 1M dollars ideas lmaoo)

Stop blaming yourself for not being able to follow systems that weren't built for you. You aren't a broken neurotypical person, you just have an interest-based nervous system.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go finish those three dishes before I forget why I walked into the kitchen in the first place (';",22,1771182858.0,GetMotivated,5,0.75,False

My husband is Eastern European and we go to an Orthodox Church (I live in the US). My oldest child has high functioning ASD and has been receiving services for 2 years (OT and Feeding) but generally unless you know him well you can’t tell - he struggles with transitions, sharing and food textures. I have a younger sibling who is a nurse with a son on the spectrum as well. Our dad was very much of the mind that we were making excuses for poor parenting essentially and that Autism doesn’t exist and this is just misbehavior etc. African dad stuff.

Anyway, there’s a 2 other Africans at our church and one family has a 9yo who’s very much on the spectrum. I get it, it’s really hard having children with special needs and yes I know that having a level 1 kid is very very different to having a level 3 kiddo. The mom is so indifferent to this child it crushes me. Last week at coffee hour after church she was asking me where in Africa I am from and her kid came to ask for something (she has 4 total - 2 girls and another young boy) and she was so dismissive even though he was clearly struggling. She also watched as someone was being rude to him (he has zero social awareness and moved someone’s things and threw them on the floor so he could sit despite there being like 10 other open seats) and said something to the effect that he’s always been a problem.   


This week I asked (only because he wouldn’t stop trying to touch my infant and eventually I moved despite the fact that there was no room left to sit) if he was receiving any services to help him navigate and she said no because “thats just the way he is and he’s pretty useless“ she waved it off. I mentioned my son has autism as well and she said he doesn’t have that he just doesn’t behave or listen. 

Like it‘s hard enough in this country when you’re just an atypical black man and while he’s small now his behavior may look childish and benign now but not so much when he’s 5+ feet tall and out in the world. This poor child is being left out to struggle like this and it’s crushing me. I’m sure his teachers have mentioned it to this lady that he needs an IEP or help or something but I gave a feeling she may have just dismissed them as well. There’s obviously nothing I can do.

Je viens chercher des avis concernant ma situation professionnelle.

Je suis employée en restauration (convention collective restauration rapide), embauchée en tant qu’employée polyvalente niveau 1 échelon A.

Je travaille dans un coffee shop / cantine du midi.

Contexte :

	•	CDI 35h, du lundi au vendredi

	•	Heures supplémentaires non payées mais récupérables

	•	Salaire : 2199,21 € brut / 1745 € net

	•	En poste depuis fin octobre (première expérience seule en cuisine)

Mon rôle réel :

Je suis seule en cuisine toute la semaine (la patronne fait le service le samedi).

Je gère :

	•	Les livraisons

	•	Les stocks

	•	L’hygiène (HACCP)

	•	La création des menus

	•	Toutes les préparations (salé + sucré)

	•	L’organisation de la production

	•	L’anticipation de la semaine (je travaille seule le lundi pour préparer)

En pratique, je suis donc cheffe de cuisine, même si le lieu est petit.

Mes questions :

	1.	Est-ce que le salaire vous semble cohérent pour ce niveau de responsabilité ?

	2.	Est-ce que ma classification (niveau 1 échelon A) correspond réellement à mes missions ?

	3.	Puis-je prétendre à un reclassement (niveau / échelon supérieur) au vu des responsabilités ?

	4.	Est-ce que le fait d’être seule en cuisine change juridiquement quelque chose ?

I have played Satisfactory several times, but I have never finished it.  Since it first came to Early Access, before much of the map was developed, I have enjoyed this game.  I love the mechanics, world, and truly respect how much Coffee Stain has listened and added both our requests and their own great ideas.  The game is incredible, and I really want to play it.  However, no matter what I seem to do, I have always gotten to a point where I can no longer progress, because I cannot retain a sense of order.  My early play throughs were spaghetti and clipping.  Bothered me some, but not enough my enthusiasm couldn't push through it.  I've learned to build some efficient factories since then, but historically it all comes to a halt when I hit Trains.  That point in the game when you can no longer do everything from one region of the game.  Every attempt I have made to build a transportation and logistics system has ended with me frustration quitting.  Something about that step triggers some stubborn perfectionism and I hate everything I do.

I know part of it is that I am trying to organize and plan everything in my head.  I have looked at tools to help, but haven't found anything (yet) that helps me form a whole map plan.  I use the interactive map,  but have never spent the time to plan, from the most complex part down, how many of each part I would need total.  Where each resource is located, where I would need specific sub-factories, and the most effective routes to get all these items to a massive, main factory.

**Harada:** Master, if you have a bit of free time, won’t you accompany me to the simulator? 



**Harada:** Well then, I’ll go and prepare some things, so please wait for a while. 



**xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx**



**Guda:** Grasslands as far as the eye can see, huh… Harada-san?  
**Guda:** So, where did Harada-kun go?



**Harada:** I’ve made you wait, Master.



**Harada:** I ran into a bit of trouble procuring a horse.



**Harada:** Here, please hop on, Princess.



**Harada:** Now then, please make sure to hold on tightly.



**Harada:** What, just leave it to me. I’ve mastered how to handle this guy.



**Harada:** There!



**xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx**



**Harada:** Yahoo! Fly off!



**Guda:** It’s surprisingly quite a rough ride!  
**Guda:** C-can we go a bit slower?



**(If option 1)**  
**Harada:** Is that so? Something like this is normal, you know.



**Harada:** The way I rode was even rougher, back when I pretended to be a bandit.



**(If option 2)**  
**Harada:** Whoa there, sorry about that. It’s been a while so I got carried away.



**Harada:** After all, I used to run around like this, back when I pretended to be a bandit. 



**Harada:** Then again, I think I really did overspeed this time. I guess it’s time to slow the pace down. 



**xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx**



**Harada:** I died under this sky.



**Harada:** As I closed my eyes in this grassland, the faces of my family, of the people I’ve betrayed…



**Harada:** The faces of those I’ve killed, one after the other…



**Harada:** Started to appear and disappear, appear and then disappear.



**Harada:** But even so, I didn’t feel anything.



**Harada:** Truly, nothing…



**Harada:** Master, won’t you spend a bit more time with me today?



**Harada:** After all, we don’t get many chances like this. 



**Guda:** OK  
**Guda:** Let’s go wherever you want to go. 



**Harada:** Thanks.



**Harada:** Well then, let's go for one more run!



**Harada:** Go!



**xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx**



**Harada:** Hahahahahahahahaha! The sake sure tastes great tonight!



**Harada:** How about one cup, Master?



**Harada:** Oh right, sake still is bad for you huh.



**Harada:** Well then, please take this coffee instead.



**Guda:** Thank you.  
**Guda:** So you’re drinking sake, huh?



**(If option 1)**  
**Harada:** Sorry about that. I’ve even made you accompany me.



**(If option 2)**  
**Harada:** Well, I was quite the big drinker back when I was with the squad.  
  
**Harada:** Back when the Shinsengumi just started, we used to always cause a ruckus, drinking until morning.



**Harada:** Each and every one of us did something outrageous once the place got way too lively.



**Harada:** Even I got roped into it, see…



**Harada:** And was made to parade the scar on my stomach around.



**Harada:** Well, let’s just call it the mistakes of youth. 



**Guda:** Did it hurt?  
**Guda:** Can I touch it?



**(If option 1)**  
**Harada:** Well of course it did hurt! The blood was gushing everywhere.



**(If option 2)**  
**Harada:** Eh? Well, I don’t mind but, it’s just an old scar, you know?



**Harada:** But as you know I was a spy for the Iyo-Matsuyama domain.



**Harada:** And I was trained to do as I was told. 



**Harada:** So that made me think that was normal, that it’s just how things worked.



**Harada:** But one day, I had an argument with my superior and suddenly, everything seemed ridiculous to me. 



**Harada:** I’ve had enough, so I tried to cut my stomach open.



**Harada:** And when I saw the blood flowing out, I thought, “Aah, this is the end,” and looked down on my own body blankly.



**Harada:** But even after all that, I didn’t even manage to die. 



**Harada:** After that, I’ve become indifferent to everything.



**Harada:** I just did what I was told, working for the Shogunate and the domain.



**Harada:** And while I was in that state, the domain ordered me to head out for Edo and…



**Harada:** That was where… I met those guys.



**Harada:** It was my job to become a mole, so I didn’t really think anything of it.



**Harada:** It was just the same as usual for me, I’ll just stick with them until it’s time for my next assignment.



**Harada:** That was all it was.



**Harada:** Drinking in the dojo until morning, declaring that all of us will save the country..



**Harada:** Talking about all our stupid dreams.



**Harada:** I just played along, smiling politely. Thinking about when I’ll be able to leave. 



**Harada:** And then I went with those guys to Kyoto, and the Roshigumi became the Shinsengumi.



**Harada:** The group grew rapidly, made a name for itself due to the Ikedaya incident, and was finally named as a retainer of the Shogunate.



**Harada:** It was just like a dream come true…



**Harada:** But by that time, I was starting to feel ill at ease about deceiving them…



**Harada:** And apart from that, I also felt a strange sense of comfort.



**Harada:** I began to think of something pointless, that at the very least, I’d fight alongside them until death.



**Harada:** But, there was no way the story would end so perfectly.



**Harada:** After that, as you know, the Shinsegumi became fragmented.



**Harada:** Everyone who wanted to live died, and I who wanted to die, lived.



**Harada:** And so, after nearly dying multiple times, drifting about here and there, I finally left the country.



**Harada:** Desperate to die, I did one reckless thing after the other, and still failed, only failed to die.



**Harada:** And finally, I closed my eyes under this sky.



**Harada:** That was finally when this Harada Sanosuke’s life ended.



**Harada:** Well, that was what was supposed to happen.



**Harada:** As you can see, I still continue to fail to die like this.



**Harada:** It’s nothing but a shameful story.



**Guda:** It’s thanks to that that we were able to meet.  
**Guda:** It’ll all work out somehow, as long as you're alive.



**(If option 1)**  
**Harada:** You’re… right about that.



**(If option 2)**  
**Harada:** As long as I’m alive…



**Harada:** It’ll all work out, as long as I don’t die, huh…That’s true.



**Harada:** Sorry about that, I’ve made you listen to such a pointless story.



**Harada:** Oh right, right, this was supposed to be the main topic here. 



**Harada:** This is my thanks for accompanying me.



**Harada:** Please don’t worry, it’s not stolen goods or anything like that.



**Harada:** Back when I was in the continent, a merchant I knew well gave this to me. 



**Harada:** It’s become quite chilly, so please feel free to use it as a shawl.



**Guda:** Thank you.  
**Guda:** It’s so red, huh?



**(If option 1)**  
**Harada:** I should be the one saying that.



**(If option 2)**  
**Harada:** Yeah, I quite like it, the color red.



**Harada:** Now then, should we start heading back?



**Guda:** I think I’ve become a bit sleepy.  
**Guda:** Wouldn’t that be considered drunk driving?



**(If option 1)**  
**Harada:** Well, it’s become quite dark after all. Then should just head back once the dawn breaks.



**Harada:** Alright Master, please go and take a nap.



**(If option 2)**  
**Harada:** Hm? Well, though it’s a horse, now that you've said that, you’re right…



**Harada:** Alright then, let’s wait until dawn and let’s go back once I’ve shaken off this alcohol.

**Harada:** I’m really sorry about making you wait, so please go ahead and take a nap, Master.



**Harada:** And I’ll handle the night watch.



**xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx**



**Harada:** Sleeping with such a contented look…



**Harada:** But honestly, giving a gift to a guy like me…



**Harada:** Just what were you thinking?



**Harada:** What would you do if I were some kind of a spy, and stabbed you while you were sleeping, huh?



**Harada:** You shouldn’t easily trust a guy like me, you know?



**Guda:** There’s no way that would happen, right?  
**Guda:** Well, we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.



**(If option 1)**  
**Harada:** It really might happen, you know…



**(If option 2)**  
**Harada:** You’re quite the outrageous princess, huh… 



**Harada:** Yeah, you might be right…



**Harada:** Dying when the time comes, living while still alive.



**Harada:** But, at the very least, as long as I am here, I will never let you die, so please rest assured.



**Harada:** Yeah, let’s be together and fail to die, until our both our deaths.

# Silk Brocade From the Continent

  


A return gift from Harada Sanosuke.



This red silk fabric was given to me as thanks by a merchant I happened to help back when I was a bandit on the continent. Its exact origin is unclear, but it’s a beautiful piece, dyed in red.



I figured I’d keep it as a souvenir for when I eventually returned home, but I never did make it back, and ended up dying a dog's death instead. It's a classic case of wasted treasure.



It might be a bit flashy, but it's quality is quite high, so feel free to have it tailored into a kimono or use it however you like.



Yeah, I truly am happy that I was able to give it to the Master.

I’m 24yo now and back when I was in middle school I met a girl that I developed my first ever official feelings for, well she may not have lived near me and I hadn’t known much about her it was one of those meaningful experiences you have where you meet someone and you never forget. Well fast forward to high school, I’m 15 about this timeframe and she had long past been out of my life since then, however on a family trip to the Zoo, I ran into, she remembered me then, cause she had waved and I ran over to say hello, had to explain to my mom who she was after lol. Hadn’t seen her since that day. Well then 3-4 days ago I woke up and was randomly remembering the memory of running into her at the Zoe, over and over again, like the memory replayed itself for a good hour and a half while I laid in bed waking up. 3 hours later my Facebook sent me a new friend suggestion notification, and it was HER profile. And in all honesty I was kinda shocked, but shrugged it off as a coincidence. Not even 24 hours after I stumbled across her Tinder. ATP I panicked and when I went to close the app my finger slipped and swiped right, my best friend was sitting next to me while this happened and asked what happened cause I dropped my phone, so I explained all of it to him, and he urged me to send a friend on Facebook and shoot a message, so I did. Well I feel that was a major mistake cause she said she didn’t remember me and stop responding, I even tried saving it by saying “Even if you don’t remember me would you like to meet up for a Coffee or a Drink” to which she left unanswered. Fast forward 2 days later and now her TikTok is showing up on my FYP and her Instagram is on my suggested feed. Like I’m not crazy ftw is this???",1,1771182599.0,mentalhealth,3,1.0,False

All 4-5 story mixed use buildings are on the main loop, allowing parking garages all to exit onto the loop, not crowd the center of town.

A new open air, but covered ampitheater in the middle brings more options for concerts through more of the calendar year. It could have plastic sides or foldable doors that close it up and allow for full year round use. Multiple large pedestrian squares also provide places to get food and coffee, similar to bridgeport, but with more true public space.

A large parking garage for the entire village is on the freeway side of the loop (west). So you get off the freeway, turn left at first light, turn right into garage to attend events, go to stores, etc. This limits non-local traffic. On top of the garage, no one parks due to weather. So let's make the top of the garage for leased space. How about a bowling alley with tall glass in all directions with views of Mt. Hood, the downtown zone, an the freeway and hills beyond. Also provides an attraction for families, similar to Big Al's but in the air.

All buildings have condos with covered balconies, allowing residents to sit outside and people watch the pedestrian ways that cross all over this district.

Trader Joe's would beg to be in one of these residential buildings and it could have a parking garage for itself that also empties onto the collector road loop.

The existing plan ads multiple lights to wilsonville road, which is already too many lights. It cuts the land into a small grid, which is terrible for pedestrians and will make the average size only suitable for crap apartments.

Affordability doesn't have to be crap.

I've been drinking lattè's using a magimix nespresso machine with an attached milk frother for the past few years.

(mostly using the nespresso hazelnut tasting cups)

But lately I've also been wanting a ""normal"" cup of coffee sometimes ,so I purchased an aeropress a few days ago and im liking it this far.

I've been tasting a few beans from a local shop and I like experimenting with the different recipes (playing with steep times and fine/coarse settings with my hand grinder.

whilst searching for recipes on the internet I bumped on alot of videos about people making espressos with machines and their whole morning routine of making one .

I absolutely enjoy the process of making my aeropress coffee , not sure why but it feels relaxing ,soothing.

prepping a portafilter, and making an espresso , handsteaming the milk to eventually enjoy a fresh lattè really looks like something in would enjoy doing.

so I've been looking at some ""budget"" machines , the gaggia classic e24 in particular.

looking to pairing it with a baratza encore esp. 

would the gaggia be a good choice for a daily latte ? maybe a few at once when I have friends over ?

I know the gaggia classic e24 can be modded like crazy but at first I would like to keep it simple and make good espressos.

how big is the difference in taste compared to a latte made with a nespresso pod ?

Will patients stick with it?,"# ‘It’s not an easy pill to take’: The first highly anticipated GLP-1 pill is here, but physicians aren’t sure it has the staying power of the injections

  
Patients are thrilled that there’s finally a GLP-1 pill, but swallowing one is not as simple as it seems.

Taking Novo Nordisk’s 



 Wegovy pill is an exacting process. You have to take it first thing in the morning, on an empty stomach, with no more than half a cup of water. Then you wait 30 minutes before eating breakfast, drinking coffee and other liquids, or taking other medications. You have to take the pill every day at the same time, and you must store it in the bottle (and not a pill box for travel).



“There’s no other really big upside,” said Diana Thiara, medical director of the University of California, San Francisco, Weight Management program. “Why would you do something that’s marginally less effective and not actually that much easier?”

GE Vernova CEO Discusses U.S. Electricity Demand[See All Videos](https://www.marketwatch.com/video?mod=cx_article_hc)

The prevailing idea has been that a pill is easier to take, it’s cheaper and it doesn’t require refrigeration like Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s 



 Zepbound injections. It’s also been pitched as an alternative to people who say they don’t want to use an injector pen or a needle.



But some physicians are skeptical that patients will stick with the Wegovy pill given the onerous daily regimen and comparable pricing to the Wegovy injection, especially if they end up not losing as much weight as they expect to. Instead of seeing a game-changer, these doctors view the Wegovy pill as another option in the toolbox that’ll only work for certain patients.

“There’s going to be a lot of patients that get a good benefit from it,” said Scott Kahan, director of the National Center for Weight and Wellness in Chevy Chase, Md. “There’s also going to be quite a lot of patients that end up not using it, or try it and find the administration to be somewhat difficult, but that’s OK.”

That said, the launch of the Wegovy pill is off to a [roaring start](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-a-hit-wegovy-weight-loss-drug-pill-prescriptions-surge-acdcf466?mod=article_inline). About 170,000 people in the U.S. had been prescribed the Wegovy pill by the first week in February, and “most” are paying directly for the medication, according to comments made by Novo’s executives last week. Novo is charging $149 per month for the two lowest doses right now, and then the price goes up to $299 a month for the most effective doses. (The Wegovy injection costs $199 to start and then $349 to keep taking it.)

It’s the first oral GLP-1 specifically approved for weight management. GLP-1 traditionally works best in an injection, but Novo Nordisk engineered the pill using technology that it acquired in 2020 to improve how well semaglutide — the medication’s active ingredient — is absorbed. 

“This is not just a pill,” Novo CEO Mike Doustdar said last week during an earnings call. “It’s a peptide. It’s a large protein inside the pill that gives you that incredible efficacy.”

Demand is huge, and so are the marketing budgets. Two Super Bowl ads mentioned the Wegovy pill. Wall Street has breathlessly tracked weekly the pill’s prescription volume, and the early numbers [briefly lifted](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-30/novo-nordisk-obesity-pill-spurs-rebound-from-stock-s-worst-year) Novo’s long-struggling stock in January. One analyst described it as the “fastest launch ever.” It’s no wonder that Hims & Hers Health 



 rushed its own compounded version of the Wegovy pill to market before [dropping](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/hims-hers-stock-poised-for-heavy-losses-after-quick-u-turn-on-plan-for-oral-wegovy-competitor-c859798e?mod=article_inline) those plans amid a legal dispute with Novo and U.S. regulators.



Novo is facing its own clock. Lilly is gearing up to launch a new non-peptide GLP-1 pill that won’t have the same administration restrictions as the Wegovy pill. Lilly also said last week that it will have a “similar” entry price. The Food and Drug Administration is set to decide whether to approve Lilly’s orforglipron by sometime this summer. Novo Nordisk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

For now, patients are still trying to figure out if it’s right for them. On Reddit, they are trading tips about how to handle the regimen, whether that’s setting an early alarm, taking the pill, and going back to bed for 30 minutes, or asking how to relieve acid reflux from the pill if they do go back to bed.

“It’s not an easy pill to take,” said Scott Isaacs, an endocrinologist at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta. “It’s this regime that can be onerous, and then when people learn about that, they say, ‘Well, maybe taking a shot once a week is easier.’”

Novo sells another semaglutide pill called Rybelsus that’s approved to treat type 2 diabetes with similar requirements around administration. Some experts are now taking a second look at that data to better understand what adherence to the Wegovy pill could look like. 

“I do know — from my experience prescribing Rybelsus, which is basically the same thing for diabetes — it’s hard to get patients to stay on it,” Isaacs said. “We see a lot of treatment failures, and when you assess why it’s a treatment failure, most of the time it’s because they’re not taking the medication correctly.”

There is some data to back that up. The pharmacy benefit manager Prime Therapeutics published a [study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11293763/) in 2024 that found patients who did not have diabetes and started taking Rybelsus were far less adherent to the medication than those on Ozempic and Wegovy injections. (All three drugs are made with semaglutide as the main ingredient, though they are approved for different conditions and with different doses.)

The research compared adherence rates for people starting eight GLP-1s in 2021, though it doesn’t reflect some of the broader market dynamics at play that year. Wegovy wasn’t approved until the middle of 2021, and Novo was dealing with major supply issues by the end of that year.

In general, it can be harder for some patients to adhere to a daily pill rather than a weekly injection, experts say. Adherence rates are usually lower in real life than in the closely controlled environment of clinical trials. But some [prefer](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7839441/#:~:text=Understanding%20patients'%20preferences%20for%20once,13) a daily pill over a weekly injection.

“If people don’t follow that very explicit requirement about how to take it, you will not get the extent of the drug absorption that you need to get the full effect,” said Pat Gleason, Prime Therapeutics’ assistant vice president of health outcomes. “You’re going to end up having stayed on \[the\] drug for six months, but you aren’t getting your 10% body weight loss that you were told you were likely to get.”

The pill led to an average weight loss of 13.6% in clinical trials, while the Wegovy injection produced about 15% weight loss.

Physicians expect they will need to switch some patients on the pill over to the injectable so they can get the weight loss they’re looking for.

“We would have no reason to say no,” UCSF’s Thiara said.

1r5mvkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1r5mvkt/miami_trip_in_aprilmay/,Miami Trip in April/May,"Hey everyone,

I’m from the UK and won a work incentive trip to Miami (26th–30th April). We’re staying at the Kimpton Surfcomber in Miami Beach and work has organised quite a few things for us already:

* Private guided kayak tour in the Everglades
* Half day on a super yacht
* Tour in Little Havana

It sounds pretty good tbh.

But since I’m flying all the way from the UK, I’m wondering if I should extend the trip by 3–5 days and explore solo once the work part finishes.

I’m a big foodie, Really want to try Haitain and Cuban food and really into culture. I like wandering neighbourhoods, trying local spots, good coffee, interesting architecture, museums, that sort of thing. I’d be up for a few drinks somewhere with a good vibe and speak pretty decent spanish.

So my questions:

* Is Miami a good city to explore solo?
* Are there enough cultural / food experiences to justify an extra few days?
* Any neighbourhoods I should stay in if I extend or should I just stay by Miami Beach.
* Would it make more sense to split the extra time between Miami and somewhere else nearby?

I’ve never been to Florida before, so very open to suggestions.",0,1771182134.0,travel,3,0.5,False

1r5mv0e,https://i.redd.it/77tt87fqhpjg1.jpeg,We should stop Headcanon Sanemi as an alcoholic. (Art by @rich_kmt on X),"Not only because there's no canon Source whatsoever that says anything about him using alcohol to cope with trauma before joining the corp or after the finale battle at all, but also because ot doesn't match him at all.

He doesn't have anything positive to link alcohol to it (aside from Japan's culture of using sake as offerings for the the dead+ a tool for religious ceremonies like weddings). not to mention he most likely doesn't like people who overindulge in it because they remind him of his abusive father.

In my opinion, I think he's more likely to be a coffee or cigarettes addict since these substances aren't depressants that make you sloppy, but antidepressants that makes you feel energetic (which is something Sanemi would like since he's already the type of person who values discipline and alertness)

In my early twenties I experienced sporadic fainting spells, I've never been able to exercise in the morning without risking passing out, and I've always considered myself a weak person—unable to stand for very long, unable to run for longer than 30 seconds, unable to keep up with even the most basic of exercise regime.

**I crashed hard 4.5 months ago.** One week I was traversing the city on a group bike ride, going out to coffee shops, and working a full time job. A series of unfortunate events ensue: a mild virus, a bacterial infection, a sprained back, constipation, a fight at work, a resurgence of PTSD. I wake up one morning with blood in my urine, and it was all downhill from there. 

**My most debilitating symptom was chronic fatigue.** I barely had the energy to sit up in bed, and I would crawl to my kitchen in order to refill my water. Living on the second floor of an apartment, I wasn't able to climb or descend steps so I was stranded in my abode for weeks until I gained enough strength to make it to my door. 

**Over the course of 4 months I experienced the following:**  hot flashes, temperature sensitivity (overheating), migraines, brain fog, constipation, joint pain, back pain, noise sensitivity, myosis. I was in constant misery, and no one believed that I was sick. Not my doctors, not my friends, and certainly not my mom who told me I was ""overreacting"" and that if I considered myself an analytical person I would believe my doctors that there was nothing wrong with me. 

I took matters into my own hands and decided to treat myself for POTS/dysautonomia and EDS, which my PCP had diagnosed. 

**I started these supplements** (at the advice of an integrative medicine NP who did a full blood panel on me, can refer if you live in PA, WV, NY, FL, or TX)

* Thorne Magnesium CitraMate 
* Thorne Ferrasorb 
* Lysine 500 mg
* NAC (psych recommended for OCD originally)
* CoQ10
* Vitamin D

**I adopted the following lifestyle practices**

* Pacing with Visible bracelet 
* HRV and sleep tracking with an Oura ring 
* Compression socks 
* Ample rest thanks to medical leave/unemployment 
* EMDR therapy 
* TMS (the brain zap therapy)
* Massage therapy for scoliosis and back pain 
* Physical therapy for PCP-diagnosed EDS/scoliosis 
* Symptom tracking w/ Bearable  

**I started the following medication**

* LDN 4.5 mg, originally proscribed by integrative medicine NP but now through AgelessRx \*
* Propranolol ER 60 mg, prescribed by a cardiologist after being diagnosed with POTS \*\*

\*  **Nothing got better for me until I got to 4.5 mg of LDN.** I started at 0.5 mg and was supposed to increase 0.5 mg ever 4-6 weeks. That was way too slow for me. I bought my LDN direct from Ageless and went from 1.5 > 3 > 4.5 mg in about 1 month. As soon as I hit the 4.5 mg dose my life substantially improved. I had my energy back, and I no longer felt like i was on the verge of getting the flu every day. 

\*\* **Propranolol 60 mg ER has given me my life back**. I was on 10-20 mg/day of instant release propranolol through my psych for anxiety, but this is completely different. Extended release works to keep a more constant level of propranolol in the blood stream (and is NOT comparable to taking 60 mg instant release).

**Without propranolol 60 mg ER**: 

* Resting HR: \~72 bpm
* Average HRV on a good day: \~50 
* Average stress levels (Oura ring): 5-8 hours/day, just sitting on my couch 

**With propranolol 60 mg ER**:

* Resting HR: \~55 bpm
* Average HRV on a good day: \~100 
* Average stress levels (Oura ring): 0 hours/day, 4-6 hours of ""restorative time"", just sitting on my couch

My HRV has NEVER been that high, and I can tell the difference in my body. I'm able to stand, walk, and go out in society *without my HR going above 100 bpm*. I'm no longer fatigued, though I am still pacing and incorporating ample rest. When I rest by sitting on my couch reading or by watching YouTube it truly feels like I'm resting—and my Oura ring shows my body at a ""relaxed"" or ""restorative"" state, when in the past I'm almost always in a ""stressed"" state no matter what I do. I don't feel flu-ish anymore. No more brain fog. 

**A month ago I thought I would never be able to function again.** Today I ran an errand, sat in a coffee shop (masked), and made banana bread. 

I full expect to have more bad days in my future. But I think and hope those will be bad *days,* not bad months. And, I have way more coping mechanisms and tricks up my sleeves for the next time I crash.",2,1771181824.0,POTS,1,1.0,False

She isn't my girlfriend; she is just a very good friend. I never showed her any signs that I love her (I care for her, but I don't love her).
I grew up with 3 sisters and my mom and no one else, so I am kind of hardwired to care for people who are close to me (by care, I mean ""princess treatment""). Whenever I was with her, I always made sure that she was kept well-fed, hydrated, and comfortable.
I don't even have a huge amount of friends. There are some friends who are equivalent to diamonds for me, and she is one of them. But I don't want to be in a relationship. I want to build a solid career before even thinking about getting into a relationship.
I didn't think writing ""cutie"" on the card was serious, as I always call her ""Her Highness"" and she calls me by whatever name she likes at that moment. I am confused does she likes me, is this platonic, or is it just pity?
Everything happened because I invited her to Starbucks for coffee as I had a free coffee voucher for my bday and some discount vouchers. I never thought that she would give me this much stuff.

The space is a mess of designer clothes and makeup kits. **PARINEETI** is pacing a tight circle, her heels clicking rapidly against the floor. She stops, stares at her phone—still no reply from Sidharth—and bites her lip.

**PARINEETI** (Into phone, her voice a mix of guilt and panic) Ki! Thank God tune utha liya. Listen, Sid se teri baat hui? Is he okay? Yaar, did he eat something weird? He’s acting... creepy!

**KIARA (V.O.)** (Laughing through the speaker) Pari, relax! He’s fine. Subah toh bade achhe mood mein set pe gaya tha. Kyun, kya hua?

**KIARA (V.O.)** (There is a pause, then Kiara bursts into a fit of giggles) Wait... ""Not now""? Aur head tilt? Oh my God, he’s actually doing it! Pari, he told me he was taking ""Mysterious Hero"" lessons from **Barun Sobti**. He’s practicing on you!

**PARINEETI** (She stops pacing, a look of pure disbelief crossing her face) Lessons? From Barun? Matlab... yeh brooding-hero wala drama faking hai?

# EXT. FILM SET - ONE HOUR LATER

The library set is dusty and quiet. **SIDHARTH** is leaning against a massive bookshelf, his tactical vest looking sharp. He sees Parineeti approaching from the corner of his eye. He adjusts his posture, looking deeply into the distance.

**SIDHARTH** (Internal Monologue: Focus, Sid. Emotionless. Eyes steady. Don't blink. Tu ek saya hai. You are the shadow.)

**PARINEETI** walks up to him. She doesn't look like the chirpy prankster anymore. She looks devastated. Her eyes are red (thanks to a quick dab of menthol rub). She’s holding a small, crumpled piece of paper.

**PARINEETI** (Voice trembling, barely a whisper) Sid... I get it. You’re moving on. Tujhe ab yeh sab shor-sharaba nahi chahiye. You want the silence. I respect that.

# INT. PARINEETI’S VANITY VAN - DAY

The space is a mess of designer clothes and makeup kits. **PARINEETI** is pacing a tight circle, her heels clicking rapidly against the floor. She stops, stares at her phone—still no reply from Sidharth—and bites her lip.

**PARINEETI** (Into phone, her voice a mix of guilt and panic) Ki! Thank God tune utha liya. Listen, Sid se teri baat hui? Is he okay? Yaar, did he eat something weird? He’s acting... creepy!

**KIARA (V.O.)** (Laughing through the speaker) Pari, relax! He’s fine. Subah toh bade achhe mood mein set pe gaya tha. Kyun, kya hua?

**PARINEETI** Yaar, he’s acting so weird! He looked at me like I was a total stranger, woh ajeeb sa head-tilt kiya, and then just walked out saying ""Not now."" It was so dark, Ki! I think woh live-TV wala prank thoda zyada heavy ho gaya. He’s actually upset.

**KIARA (V.O.)** (There is a pause, then Kiara bursts into a fit of giggles) Wait... ""Not now""? Aur head tilt? Oh my God, he’s actually doing it! Pari, he told me he was taking ""Mysterious Hero"" lessons from **Barun Sobti**. He’s practicing on you!

**PARINEETI** (She stops pacing, a look of pure disbelief crossing her face) Lessons? From Barun? Matlab... yeh brooding-hero wala drama faking hai?

**KIARA (V.O.)** Haa! Usey lagta hai he’s an enigma now. Don’t tell him I told you. Let him enjoy his ""Dark Era"" for a bit.

**PARINEETI** (A slow, wicked smirk spreads across her face as she looks at herself in the vanity mirror) Oh, I’m going to let him enjoy it alright. Maze toh main loongi. Thanks, Ki! Love you, bye!

# EXT. FILM SET - ONE HOUR LATER

The library set is dusty and quiet. **SIDHARTH** is leaning against a massive bookshelf, his tactical vest looking sharp. He sees Parineeti approaching from the corner of his eye. He adjusts his posture, looking deeply into the distance.

**SIDHARTH** (Internal Monologue: Focus, Sid. Emotionless. Eyes steady. Don't blink. Tu ek saya hai. You are the shadow.)

**PARINEETI** walks up to him. She doesn't look like the chirpy prankster anymore. She looks devastated. Her eyes are red (thanks to a quick dab of menthol rub). She’s holding a small, crumpled piece of paper.

**PARINEETI** (Voice trembling, barely a whisper) Sid... I get it. You’re moving on. Tujhe ab yeh sab shor-sharaba nahi chahiye. You want the silence. I respect that.

1r5mkbj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r5mkbj,First impressions on 28 fragrances from Pernoire and Toskovat',"More samples, more first impressions on them as per usual. This time I was very excited since I was able to get my hands on a large amount of Toskovats from Scent Split, and in general I'm excited for future first impressions because I'll start looking into more artisanal houses instead of niche brands.

**Pernoire**

• *Amoral* - Spicy, smokey, almost rubbery leather in the air with a slight fruitiness and a lemon zing. Pretty floral up close, it's bringing ATH's Noir to mind for some reason, as well as the Alexandrias from Xerjoff. Smells nice, and that tiny bit of lemon during the opening gives it an interesting edge. 8/10

• *Kama* - Sweet berry-like scent in the air, it reminded me a bit of Abercrombie's Authɛntic Night, which I used to own a long time ago. Soft woods, orris and more sweetness up close, no leather at all but I'm sure it'll come up on skin. Without the leather I'd go as far as say it leans slightly feminine but just a touch. Something in here smells like Baccarat Rouge, but not as harsh and metallic as BR is to my nose. 8/10

• *Mansa* - I get a soft green smell from this in the air. I get a similar berry-like smell in this as in Kama, but more tart. It also has a slight leathery nuance similar to Amoral. Not sure why I can't pick apart this scent, but it's nice, smells rather clean on paper despite having oud listed as a note. In hindsight this is the only fragrance from the bunch that feels a bit aimless and without purpose, but it's a nice scent nonetheless. 8/10

• *Masar* - Extremely nice soft, fruity, vanillic smell in the air, it is a very lovely scent. Very animalic and slightly leathery up close, however, pungent in a similar way to BeauFort's Vi Et Armis, perhaps similar to Nasomatto's Nudiflorum too? This one will definitely have to go on skin, that animalic side could work very well with the sweetness or very horribly. It's an interesting fragrance. 8/10

• *Naki* - Soft fruity and floral smell in the air. Not that this is generic but I've smelled similar stuff before in women's fragrances, which by the way this leans feminine. I can definitely see the fig leaf, peach, osmanthus and passionfruit notes, but they're all coming from one same ""cloud"" of scent. I think the fig leaf is the most defined of those notes, though. Very well blended. As it dries on paper it starts developing an airiness I find a bit nauseating, might be calone and it would make sense since this lists ""sea notes"" in the base. 7/10

• *Otimo* - Sweet, sugary quince smell in the air, and it's actually pretty rɛalistic. Soft, powdery, a bit boozy close up, and it also has a biscuit-like note. A nice gourmand for sure. 8/10

• *Tierra* - I get a soft fruity, sugary smell in the air that strongly reminds me of a Mexican candy called Duvalín. Up close this smells like berry syrup with benzoin, but the combination of both notes doesn't work too well. This might be better on skin but I'm disappointed. 5/10

• *Vitias* - Limey, peppery, quite musky and a bit aquatic but at least right now I'm thankfully not picking up any calone from this, unlike Naki. Smells clean, almost like walking out of the shower, but I don't think this will last or project that much. 8/10

I wouldn't say Pernoire has been the most imaginative niche house I've come across but they do have some interesting and generally good fragrances. I had orịginally purchased their other discovery set as well, which includes Anelo, Melos, Poka and Oudian, but the perfumery I had bought the set from didn't actually have it in stock so my order was cancelled. I am still interested in getting my hands on that set, however.

**Toskovat'**

• *Age of Innocence* - Smells like a sweet berry-like syrup in the air, not cloying or sticky surprisingly, supported by a slight smokey undertone, both notes incredibly well blended with one another. Up close it has both a slight caramelized facet, like a hard candy, mixed with a very distinct gasoline-like smell, the same you pick up when you're fueling up your car, but obviously not as harsh. As it starts drying on paper the gasoline smell starts dissipating and you're left mostly with the caramelized smell. This is an extremely interesting scent, and it actually smells very wearable in my opinion. Starting off incredibly strong. 9/10

• *Anarchist A-* - Not as immediately present in the air as Age of Innocence, this is more subtle and it smells old, like a place full of old wooden furniture and stale air, or the room in your house full of boxes with old clothes and toys you stopped playing with many years ago. Up close it still gives off an old smell but now it's resinous, with a similar caramelized, almost coffee-like smell like Age of Innocence's, probably myrrh. Not boozy per se but I could see this reminding people of whiskey, it's just missing the alcoholic sharpness that whiskey notes tend to have. Pretty interesting, maybe not the most wearable or versatile fragrance out there but wearable nonetheless. 8/10

• *Annacamento* - Green, citrusy scent in the air, but candied in a way that makes me think of a lemon pie or something along those lines, not quite as photorɛalistically gourmand as Lira but gourmand leaning. I don't like this up close, this uses hefty amounts of calone. It still has that sweet, gourmand-ish finish with citruses but the calone is overwhelmingly noticeable. I like how this smells in the air a lot, so for that I'll be a bit lenient about it using so much calone. Also to be fair to the fragrance the calone smell seems to disappear completely after some time. 8/10

• *Born Screaming* - Sweet and powdery florals in the air, extremely likeable and not totally feminine. There's also a smidge of a cherry-like undertone, but it's easy to miss. A lot more cherry up close, syrupy but not excessively sweet or sticky. Maybe my nose is playing tricks but I detect a leathery note way in the back behind the cherry and florals. Very nice, very likeable and a completely wearable scent. 9/10

• *Desert Sermons* - This is actually pretty sweet, it's a floral tobacco with powdery nuances. It somewhat reminds me of Francesca Bianchi's Sticky Fingers but leaning much more into the sweet powderiness of that fragrance. A bit spicy up close, very resinous, a faint and elusive charred/smokey facet in the deep background, but still mostly a tobacco fragrance for the most part. It's much sweeter in the air than up close. It's a nice fragrance, and I was not expecting it to be that sweet in the air, that rɛally took me by surprise. 8/10

• *Empty Wishes Well* - Smells like damp shaving cream in the air, very fougère-like surprisingly but definitely with a damp finish. Up close this is extremely earthy, almost overbearingly so. Very green and soily, but it's too strong for me, it might become nauseating after a while. The more I smell it the more I pick up on a strong mineralic facet, and the greenness of the scent smells almost like celery maybe? It brings to mind Tom Ford's Oud Minérale and Amouage's Lineage. Don't get me wrong, this replicates the concept it's conveying perfectly, the scent is just a bit too pungent for me, it's a completely conceptual scent and not that wearable at all. However I do wonder if it'll be more palatable on skin. 6/10

• *F7* - Aromatic, loads of lavender but with a touch of a sharp spiciness to it in the air, and it oddly has a savory undertone. To me this smells like a vanillic fougère, a bit old school but not entirely because of the addition of vanilla. I saw in a video not long ago that if you liked Tom Ford's Beau de Jour you might like this and I agree, this is mildly similar to the Tom Ford. It's very nice, I wish I had been able to get a sample of F2 as well as they're intended to be worn together. 8/10

• *Forlorn Embers and Black Reigns* - Pretty sweet, slightly boozy in the air. This is maple syrup with a very slight booziness and a touch of resins and tobacco up close. It makes me think of BeauFort's Terror & Magnificence, but much less ""weird"" and much more wearable. I expected this to be a darker scent but it's pretty nice. A subtle vanilla note starts peeking its head as it starts drying. 8/10

• *Génération Godard* - Surprisingly I get a lemon soda-like fizziness and a butter-ish scent in the air. This does kind of smell like soda and popcorn up close, but at the same time there's a strong, harsh smell kind of like varnish that brings the scent down a bit. Part of this scent brings to mind another BeauFort fragrance, in this case Lignum Vitae, but opposite to Forlorn Embers's case, the BeauFort is the less weird fragrance in this case. Once again this is more of a conceptual fragrance instead of a wearable one, but I prefer this to Empty Wishes Well. 7/10

• *Ichigo Ichie* - Very floral in a perfumey way, and it has an almost icy feel to it. Smells softer and much better up close, it's one big accord of soft florals over woods, perhaps a bit fruity as well? This might lean slightly feminine but it's a lovely scent. It's noticeably weaker on paper compared to other Toskovats. 8/10

• *Inexcusable Evil* - Smells like gunpowder in the air, very much like BeauFort's (and I keep bringing that brand up) Tonnerre but surprisingly I find this much more palatable than that. There's something up close that is very weird, I'm pretty sure it's iodine. This has an almost citrusy edge to it surprisingly, but this isn't that nice or palatable up close. I find the scent in the air likeable but it might be me getting accustomed to the gunpowder note through the BeauFort I mentioned earlier, but if the iodine note is detectable in the air too during a wear this will definitely be gross. I'm curious to try this on my skin. 7/10

• *Last Birthday Cake* - Sweet, vanillic, slightly powdery and floral in the air, it's reminding me of another fragrance very strongly but I'm not sure which, I think Spice d'Arno from Electimuss. This smells kind of like Forlorn Embers's sweetness but burnt, like whatever dessert is on that got burnt on the stove or fireplace. It also has a resinous bitterness similar to that of frankincense, but not smokey at all or as sharp as, for example, Amouage's fragrances perfumed by Quentin Bisch (Purpose and Decision specifically). I'd have to try this on skin but I like it a lot, especially the initial blast in the air. 9/10

• *My Past Selves' Flowers* - Green, earthy and floral scent in the air, but in a strange way, it almost smells like a floral patch after the rain. More of the same up close, the florals have an almost soapy quality to them while the green facet is definitely reminiscent of Empty Wishes Well. I want to stop bringing up BeauFort but this reminds me very strongly of Fathom V. This almost smells like a black and white picture of flowers, somber and sterile. There's an underlying sweetness to this that's quite likeable, it's a bit ambery or maybe resinous. Not my type of fragrance but it's very well done nonetheless. 8/10

• *Pining Dew 2* - Reminiscent of F7 but with a pungent edge, I can see the ""fermented pineapple"" in a way. This is sharp up close, almost like the smell of thinner or some other chemical like that, not too pleasant. It does have a green undertone but this chemical sharpness almost drowns it out completely. This may change on skin but as of right now this isn't that good. This strong sharpness subsides heavily after a while but overall the fermented pineapple smell isn't too likeable. 5/10

• *Я* - Smells like synthetic grape flavoring in the air, with a slight powdery note in the back that's almost floral. Much more floral up close, it smells like jasmine/tuberose, a faint smidge of vanilla but it doesn't come off feminine at all. It's much more pleasant up close than in the air, although the grape scent isn't dislikeable at all. I like this, I'd have to see if it doesn't become cloying. As it dries this develops an indolic tuberose-like smell, it brought to mind Areej Le Doré's Paradise Soil. 8/10

• *Silent at The Theme Park* - I get a sweet scent in the air, can't pinpoint what it is however. It has a rainy, dewy, generally watery quality to it. Up close it smells like a sharp white floral with cocoa. It's very likeable, I just found it undecipherable in the air. It's reminding me of something else but I'm not sure what it is. Like Ichigo Ichie this too isn't that strong on paper. 8/10

• *Things We Never Shared* - This one is very potent, it was like a headbutt to the nose and my nose started itching from how overwhelming it was right after spraying. It smells kind of like egg nog mixed with a vanilla hand cream. I say hand cream because it has that same icy sharpness that you feel in the back of your sinuses when you smell it up close. Up close this has a similar maple syrupiness/caramelized smell similar to Forlorn Embers, but with a very present booziness. Very nice, this might be great for the winter. My mom said this smelled like guava pudding (we call it guayabate) and in some ways I can see that too. 8/10

• *Vestibule Terror* - Very spicy and with a chocolate undertone, it's almost like a more polarizing Boccanera from Orto Parisi. Way more chocolatey up close, considerably less spicy and it has a distinct liqueur smell, maybe some hazelnuts or chestnuts in there as well. I wasn't expecting this to be a gourmand, let alone such a likeable one after smelling it in the air. Unfortunately the liqueur smell disappears after a short while but the scent is still great. 8.5/10

Overall I'm very pleased with these samples and very happy that I could try them, despite how expensive they were. I'm definitely picking up the missing ones (In The Belly Of The Beast, F2, Curtain Call, Domus Numeni, Amaretto in the Melting Room and Spinal Fluid on the Walls) at some point, preferably when Scent Split has them in stock in 2 mls again as I'd like to have all the samples be from the same place.

I'm quite surprised by how wearable many of these fragrances were with a few exceptions, obviously. I went with a different approach with these Toskovats compared to other brands, where I barely referenced their note breakdown at all (which I might do for every brand going forward). Even though their note breakdowns are usually long, I don't think many of the notes are noticeable. I wouldn't call them one-note or one-dimensional though, these are all far from it. Some of these fragrances have great blends, like Ichigo Ichie where all the florals and woods combine into one soft accord, but in others like Pining Dew 2 or maybe even Forlorn Embers I feel like there's one particular note/accord that just drowns out all the other potential notes. I'm sure all of these will be very different on skin and so I'm excited to try them in the near future. Another thing I liked about all of them is that they didn't come off as synthetic or screechy to my nose, except for Я where I'm sure it was intentional, and even then it was only one of the notes in the early opening.

1r5miyc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r5miyc,jersey cattle,"# Jersey Cattle: The Ultimate ""Recipe"" for High-Quality Dairy on Your Homestead

# 1. Introduction

Did you know that a single **Jersey cow** can produce milk containing up to 25% more butterfat and 18% more protein than the average commercial dairy breed?

In the world of dairy farming and homesteading, quantity often steals the spotlight, but quality is the silent king. While the black-and-white Holstein is the volume champion, the **Jersey cattle** breed is the undisputed queen of efficiency and flavor. Whether you are a seasoned farmer looking to diversify your herd or a homesteader dreaming of that first family cow, understanding the ""recipe"" for successfully raising this breed is crucial.

The **Jersey breed** is not just about aesthetics—though their doe-like eyes and fawn coats are stunning—it is about economics and taste. This guide will walk you through the essential components of raising **Jersey cattle**, treating the process with the same care and precision as a gourmet recipe. From the ""ingredients"" required for their care to the nutritional breakdown of their liquid gold, we’re diving deep into why the Jersey is the perfect addition to your land.

# 2. Ingredients List: Essentials for a Happy Herd

Just as a master chef needs the right supplies, a successful **Jersey cow** owner needs specific ""ingredients"" to ensure the animal thrives. Here is what you need to prepare for your bovine journey.

**The Core Essentials:**

* **1 Jersey Cow or Heifer:** Look for bright eyes, a straight back, and a history of A2/A2 genetics if possible.
* **High-Quality Forage:** **Jersey cattle** are famously efficient converters of grass to milk. You will need access to rotational pasture (lush clover and orchard grass are favorites) or high-grade alfalfa hay.
* **Fresh Water:** A lactating Jersey can drink 30 to 50 gallons of water a day.
* **Mineral Supplements:** Loose minerals specifically balanced for dairy breeds (high in calcium and magnesium) to prevent metabolic issues.

**The ""Kitchen"" Tools (Equipment):**

* **Shelter:** A three-sided run-in shed is often sufficient, but a dry, draft-free barn is ideal for winter.
* **Milking Stanchion:** A secure, comfortable place for the cow to stand while you milk.
* **Sanitation Kit:** Iodine teat dip, udder wipes, and a stainless steel milking pail.

**Substitutions & Variations:**

* *Limited Space?* If you don't have acres of pasture, **Jersey cattle** adapt well to ""dry lot"" living, provided they are fed high-quality hay and exercised.
* *Calf Sharing:* Instead of milking twice a day, you can ""share"" the milk with the calf, milking only once a day to free up your schedule.

# 3. Timing: The Commitment Involved

Raising animals is a ""slow-cook"" process; you cannot rush nature. However, understanding the time investment helps you plan your life around the herd.

* **Prep Time (Gestation):** Approximately 283 days (9 months). This is the ""marinating"" phase where proper nutrition is vital for the developing calf.
* **Active Time (Daily Chores):** 45–60 minutes per day per cow. This includes two milking sessions (morning and evening), feeding, and cleaning.
* **Total Time:** A 10–12 year commitment. **Jersey cattle** are known for their longevity and can remain productive well into their teens.

**Data Insight:** A Jersey cow reaches sexual maturity earlier than other breeds (often by 11-13 months), meaning you can get your ""production line"" moving roughly **15% faster** than with larger beef or dairy breeds.

# 4. Step-by-Step Instructions: Raising the Perfect Jersey

# Step 1: Sourcing and Selection

Start by selecting a **Jersey cow** from a reputable breeder. Do not just look at the animal; look at the udder. You want a well-attached udder with teats that are evenly spaced. Ask for health records, specifically testing for Johnny's Disease and BLV (Bovine Leukemia Virus).

# Step 2: The Feeding Regime

**Jersey cattle** have a unique metabolism. They are pound-for-pound the most efficient converters of feed in the dairy world.

* **Actionable Tip:** Feed them strictly according to their lactation cycle. When they are producing milk, they need higher energy. A mix of pasture and a small ration of 16% dairy grain during milking keeps their condition score steady without making them obese.

# Step 3: The Milking Routine

Consistency is key. Cows crave routine.

* Establish a set time (e.g., 6:00 AM and 6:00 PM).
* Bring the cow to the stanchion and offer her grain.
* Clean the udder thoroughly.
* Milk out completely to ensure you get the ""hindmilk,"" which is where the highest butterfat content lives.
* **Pro Tip:** Play soft music. Studies suggest cows let down milk easier in calm, low-stress environments.

# Step 4: Breeding and Calving

To keep the milk flowing, a cow must have a calf. Jerseys are known for ""calving ease"" due to their smaller calf size. Monitor them closely during their due date, but be prepared to step back; Jerseys have strong maternal instincts and usually handle the process well on their own.

# 5. Nutritional Information: The Jersey Advantage

While we aren't eating the cow, the ""nutritional yield"" of the **Jersey breed** is what makes them famous. Here is the breakdown of the milk they produce compared to the industry standard Holstein.

|**Nutrient Component**|**Holstein Milk (Avg)**|**Jersey Milk (Avg)**|**The Difference**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Butterfat**|3.7%|4.9% - 5.5%|Jerseys have \~30% more fat|
|**Protein**|3.1%|3.9%|Higher yields for cheese making|
|**Calcium**|Standard|\+15% Higher|Better for bone health|
|**Solids-Not-Fat**|8.7%|9.5%|Creamier texture|

**Data Insight:** Because of the high solids content, you need approximately **20% less Jersey milk** to make the same amount of cheese or butter as you would with Holstein milk. This makes the **Jersey cow** the undisputed champion of the micro-dairy.

# 6. Healthier Alternatives for the ""Recipe""

In the context of dairy farming, ""healthier alternatives"" refer to management practices that optimize the health of the milk and the animal.

* **A2/A2 Genetics:** Many people who believe they are lactose intolerant are actually sensitive to the A1 beta-casein protein found in most commercial milk. A significantly higher percentage of **Jersey cattle** carry the A2/A2 gene naturally. By genetically testing your herd and breeding for A2, you produce milk that is easier on human digestion.
* **Grass-Fed Only:** While grain increases volume, a 100% grass-fed diet increases the CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid) and Omega-3 fatty acids in the milk. This results in a product that supports heart health and inflammation reduction.

# 7. Serving Suggestions: Utilizing the Bounty

You have raised the cow and harvested the milk. Now, what do you do with 4-6 gallons of rich, creamy milk every day?

* **The ""Cream Top"" Experience:** Pour the milk into glass jars and let it sit in the fridge for 24 hours. The cream will separate to the top (the cream line on Jersey milk is legendary). Spoon this off for coffee, whipped cream, or making butter.
* **Golden Butter:** Because Jersey milk has larger fat globules and high beta-carotene (from grass), the butter churns quickly and is a deep, beautiful yellow color naturally.
* **Artisan Cheese:** The high protein-to-fat ratio makes this milk ideal for Cheddar, Gouda, and Camembert.

# 8. Common Mistakes to Avoid

Even experienced farmers can stumble with the **Jersey breed** if they aren't careful.

* **Overfeeding Grain (Milk Fever):** Jerseys are prone to *hypocalcemia* (Milk Fever) right after calving. This is often caused by feeding too much calcium or grain *before* the calf is born, which messes up their calcium mobilization.
   * *Fix:* Keep pre-calving cows on a low-calcium diet to prime their metabolism.
* **Underestimating the Bulls:** While Jersey cows are docile and sweet, **Jersey bulls** are notoriously aggressive and unpredictable.
   * *Advice:* Never turn your back on a Jersey bull. For small homesteads, Artificial Insemination (AI) is safer than keeping a bull.
* **Ignoring Body Condition:** Because they are dairy animals, they look ""bony"" compared to beef cows. However, do not let them get too thin. A spine that looks like a saw blade indicates a need for higher energy feed.

# 9. Storing Tips for the Recipe (Milk Management)

Hygiene and temperature control are the preservatives of the dairy world.

* **Rapid Cooling:** The ""danger zone"" for bacteria is between 40°F and 140°F. You must chill your raw milk to below 40°F within one hour of milking to maintain that sweet, fresh flavor.
* **Glass over Plastic:** Store Jersey milk in glass jars. Plastic can harbor odors and bacteria in microscopic scratches, which can taint the delicate flavor profile of the milk.
* **Freeze the Surplus:** Milk can be frozen! If you are overwhelmed during peak lactation, freeze milk in bags to use for soap making or animal feed later in the winter.

# 10. Conclusion

Raising **Jersey cattle** is a labor of love that pays dividends in rich, golden cream and self-sufficiency. While they require specific care regarding minerals and climate protection, their efficiency and personality make them the ultimate choice for the family farm.

**In short:** Provide quality pasture, manage their calcium intake carefully, and treat them with gentleness. In return, the Jersey cow will provide you with the highest quality dairy imaginable.

# 11. FAQs

**Q: Can a Jersey cow survive in cold climates?**

**A:** Yes, but they need help. Unlike beef breeds, **Jersey cattle** carry very little body fat. In freezing temperatures, they require a draft-free barn, deep bedding (straw), and extra hay to generate metabolic body heat.

**Q: How much milk does a Jersey cow produce daily?**

**A:** An average family Jersey will produce between 4 to 6 gallons of milk per day during peak lactation. This is significantly more than a family can usually drink, so have a plan for cheese or butter making!

**Q: Are Jersey cows good for beef?**

**A:** While they are a dairy breed, Jersey beef is considered a delicacy by those in the know. The meat is darker, heavily marbled, and very tender due to the fat content. However, the ""yield"" (amount of meat per animal) is lower than beef breeds.

**Q: What is the ""Jersey personality""?**

**A:** They are the ""dogs"" of the cow world. Jerseys are highly curious, intelligent, and seek human affection. This makes them easy to handle but also means they can be mischievous if they find a loose gate latch!",1,1771181324.0,JerseyCattle,0,1.0,False

1r5meqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/DailyDoseCoolFinds/comments/1r5meqa/spent_weeks_tracking_prices_for_my_home_office/,Spent weeks tracking prices for my home office setup: Here's my actual process for finding legit deals and avoiding junk (Saved $250 on a monitor and desk 💸),"You know that feeling when you click on a ""deal"" only to find the original price was massively inflated, or it's actually cheaper on a different site anyway? Or when every other post is sponsored content thinly disguised as a genuine recommendation? Yeah, I've been there, pulling my hair out trying to find actual value in a sea of marketing hype. For a while now, I've been tracking prices, comparing specs, and basically doing the legwork to find stuff that's genuinely worth buying at a good price. It takes time, but the savings add up, and frankly, it's satisfying to beat the system.

Here are a few real-world examples from my recent finds:

*   **Wireless Noise-Cancelling Headphones:** I snagged a pair of a well-regarded brand (think Bose/Sony alternative, but not those exact brands) on a third-party refurbisher site.
    *   **Price I got:** $79 (A-grade refurbished, like new with 1-year warranty)
    *   **Regular New Price:** $130 - $160 on Amazon or the brand's site.
    *   **Actual Savings:** Around $50-$80, which is about 40-50% off new.
    *   **The Catch:** Took about 10 days to arrive, and stock was limited to just a few units. You had to be quick.

*   **1TB NVMe SSD for PC Upgrade:** A specific model known for good performance and reliability.
    *   **Price I got:** $65 from a major electronics retailer during a flash sale.
    *   **Regular Price:** Typically $90-$110 across most stores.
    *   **Actual Savings:** Roughly $25-$45, or about 30% off.
    *   **The Catch:** This was a one-day only flash deal. If you weren't looking that morning, you missed it.

*   **High-Quality Kitchen Scale:** For baking and coffee brewing, a specific brand known for precision.
    *   **Price I got:** $28 during an ""Open Box"" event at a local specialty store.
    *   **Regular Price:** $45-$55 online.
    *   **Actual Savings:** Around $17-$27, a solid 35-50% off for something basically new.
    *   **The Catch:** Required an in-person visit, and there was only one available at that price. Highly regional.

Finding these kinds of deals isn't a ""set it and forget it"" thing. It often means checking multiple sites, reading reviews beyond the first page, and sometimes waiting a bit for shipping. You definitely spend some time digging, and not every lead pans out. Sometimes the ""deal"" has hidden costs, or the product just isn't what it claims to be. But when you hit, it feels good to know you're not just falling for marketing gimmicks.

I’ve spent so long using my busy schedule as an excuse to avoid my emotions, but that's sooo unhealthy and mentally exhausting. Now that I decided to value work-life balance, I don't know na what to do with my free time. I think this is the right time to find my constant. ✨️

I am looking for something long-term. Pagod na ako mag-introduce myself to people (sana nag-interview nalang ako, magkaka-2nd job pa ako haha). 

I also value conversations with substance. Wag sana yung puro surface-level hi, hello, kumusta work, silence, and then the cycle repeats.

I am alsooo very interested in people's interests and what people do. I believe there's sooo much to learn about the world, and one way to start exploring those is to talk about people's professions and hobbies, so i hope you don't mind if I ask too many questions about your industry (hindi ako 3rd-party background check staff, promise haha).

I am not very well-versed in Tagalog, but I try. I hope you don't mind if magta-TagLish nalang ako. I try my best naman to not sound maarte.



This is getting long na. Here's a bit more about me:

* Plus size (a dealbreaker for most people, so I'm saying this upfront)
* Likes sunsets, history, fresh flowers, parks, and walkable public spaces
* Loves exploring galleries and historical landmarks
* Likes walking around the city, but not hiking (still building up the stamina for the incline)
* Loves coffee and water (I can identify local water brands blindfolded. Test me lol)
* Night owl by profession



About you:

* Age preferred is -2 or +10
* Matino and may substance kausap
* Hindi nagsesend ng unrepliable messages
* Mabait sa cats and dogs
* Hindi rude sa people, especially those in the service industry
* Can banter? I hope our vibes and humor match
* Makakasama mag-explore ng museums and galleries
* Has hobbies
* Hindi DDS

1r5mbol,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1r5mbol/writing_about_random_fictional_towns_based_in/,Writing about random fictional towns based in Southeastern Saskatchewan?,"So Saskatchewan, is a Prairie Province in Canada, located in between Alberta (to the West) and Manitoba (to the East). With Northeastern Montana to the Southwest, and Northwestern North Dakota to the Southeast.

On February 15, 2022, I bored a VIA rail passenger train from Edmonton, to Toronto.

The kept seeing me take sips of my coffee without wearing my mask and they were giving me HELL for it. 

I can't sit my coffee with my mask on, and when I was sleeping on the train it was uncomfortable to wear the mask while I slept so I took it off and every time they saw me sleeping without my mask they threatened to throw me off the train and Winnipeg and it was mine is 50° because the laws of covid were quite something.

I was doing some Google measurements from downtown San Francisco California, to Weyburn Saskatchewan, then from Weyburn to here (Southern Niagara across from Buffalo, NY.). 

- Weyburn was slightly closer to San Fran at just under 2,000 km (Moonlight Desires - Gowan) from San Francisco but slightly over 2,000 km from here (Apophis April 13, XXXXkm). 

- Estevan however, is the other way around, just over 2,000 km from San Francisco (Poker Face like Lady Gaga?), and just under 2,000 km from here (Lady and The Tramp June 26, XXXXkm). 

Another thing I realized is the population of the towns being similar to my days in age count, and I hit 11,111 days old in December. 

The 30-year-old police officer from San Fran 39er (born 1939) was just 11,086 days old on Saturday October the 11th in 1969. 

Unfortunately, he lost his partner that night a few months after a key-sighting )in an infamous unsolved crime), to an unrelated home disturbance call on New Years Day of 1970, at tragically just 22 years of age. 

So the Senior Officer was 11,086 days old on Saturday October 11th in 1969, and the fictional Detective was 11,087 days old as of December 17, 2025. 

So This detective (born August 10, 1995) was 11,087 days old as of December 17, 2025, making her OLDER than the Police Man. 

These are what my two fictional towns in SE Saskatchewan (the middle of EVERYWHERE) are going to have their populations based off the days in age of the police officer from the Saturday October 11th the 1969 (has always been 11,086 people since the 1960s) and the town based on Debra Morgan was 11,087 days old nearing the end of last year. 

Also the fictional Showtime character Dexter, had a foster sister named Debra, she was NOT his wife, RITA was his wife and the Zodiac (1939?) had fooled that FBI Agent born August 8, 1949. 

So Deb's actor is literally a week younger than the fucking wall. And she was with a man close in age with Trinity and Z too? WTF!? This was late 2009, she was literally just turning 30, likely still only 29 and this man was fucking 60? In my opinion that's disgusting... 

Harry was a Dick to Dexter and Debra, and there's actually a hockey player for my hometown whose name was Harry Dick. 

So I were a Florida Panthers Barkov Jersey all the time now, or at least have it nearby me whenever I'm watching Dexter. 

I do the same with a Dallas Stars Nichushkin Jersey with King Of The Hill or a Colorado Avalanche MacKinnon Jersey and South Park. 

In late 2021, I stopped drinking (Fri Dec 3) for over 24 weeks or 168 days (until Sat May 21) with the intentions of 145. 

On Sat May 21, a cereal kisser (or kicker) was Born Sat May 21 in 1960, my parents always told me my middle name sake was after my dad. Not true, it was Missouri's State Capitol for what a dope state that I have literally James Shit to do with. 

So 1881, was 145 years ago (when James turned 34 on September the 5th) and 1882 was 144 years ago (April 3 this year is 144 years since James went to Bloody Heaven? 

So the Blue Ghost Tunnel, is a REAL tunnel I'm not lying about, it is an abandoned railway tunnel located in Thorold Ontario, running underneath the former third Welland Canal in between locks 18 and 19. 

The Red Ghost Tunnel, unlike the Blue Ghost Tunnel, is NOT a real tunnel. ",1,1771180842.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

The hot water seems to work just fine. I do get a coffee puck, which gets wet, but doesn’t stay all together when falling in the tray.

Things I have tried:

\- cleaned the spout outlets

\- cleaned the insides of the motor

\- replaced the water sprout

\- replaced a possible leaking hose connection to solenoid valve (5313225171) 

\- replaced the vaporizer (cracked the old one while tightening a fitting because of a tiny leak)

\- cleaned the brew unit

\- cleaned the piston (0308767062) found a cracked rubber ring and replaced that

\- did a reset

I was about to buy gaggia classic already year ago, and I'm so happy that I have delayed this decision until last week, After reading how much changed with this machine in last year with E24 version released, I'm so super happy this decision ended up this year.

I was already patiently waiting over a month for this yellow sunshine to be produced and delivered as stock dried up. I was so excited when machine arrived, I was 2h late in job as I was testing it out. Went to job with shaking hands after 3 espresso shots :D

I love that design, that color, everything about this setup is just perfect for me. And as I can afford as expensive machines as La Marzocco, I just couldn't justify buying this machine over this amazing setup. It's like buying old car over super car, just because it has more soul and just feels right.

I love fiddling around and already designed and printed few accessories and minor mods, I'm planning to buy gaggimate later this year and have a good time doing some adult lego with this machine :)

So far I'm so amazed with coffee coming out of this setup, I can't name a single coffee that I had in my life than what I can taste now. Yes, there were fancy ones with some crazy tastes, but maybe it's just very biased now, and emotional, as it will be really hard now to enjoy something else than true specialty coffee places over this what I can prepare myself.

Also as mentioned is earlier post, I'm planning to create my own parts and do some stuff modifying it, that I would be glad that maybe some day some other people will be able to enjoy my projects :) ",33,1771180628.0,espresso,11,1.0,False

My son a couple years ago was prescribed a non-stimulant medication. It was primarily for school after we got him diagnosed and it helps tremendously, with minimal to no side effects. (A rarity I know).

Problem is- I am not only autistic but a narcoleptic. So on the weekends his med schedule is borderline non existent-

Because either 

1. I slept in so late

or

2. He puts up such a fight to take them I don’t have the energy to keep at it.

Unfortunately he’s come to learn if he pushes hard enough I’ll give up as I’m too tired to fight him on it. 

I’ve tried small rewards and then slowly taking them away, I’ve tried offering drinks he likes to go with it- I’m a Dr. Pepper fan so since it’s a non-stimulant I let him have some of that to take it. 

I offer sips of my coffee after- I drink Korean whipped coffee and offer him a sip. 

I would like to clarify he has ALWAYS been medication avoidant- even when he was a toddler. Doesn’t matter if it was Tylenol, or Zofran (he had severe strep on and off before tonsillectomy), to now acid reflux meds.

I don’t know what to do. 

Any advice would be appreciated to be able to help get him to take his medication. 

I would continue to let him skip weekends- but he gets so irritated progressively worse, I just don’t think that’s an option.",1,1771180501.0,ADHDparenting,2,1.0,False

I recently went to my mom’s house and found an old K-Swiss branded binder packed with my Pokémon cards from about 25 years ago. I completely forgot I even still had them. Kind of crazy they’ve just been sitting there this whole time.

I went out and bought fresh sleeves and started carefully going through them. These are all vintage cards from the late 90s / early 2000s that I collected as a kid. A few of them honestly look insanely clean. No visible whitening, sharp corners, good centering. From what I can tell, they *look* like they could grade PSA 10… but I’m obviously not an expert.

I took the binder to a local card shop in Tampa (Joe's trading card and coffee shop)  just to get a feel for value. The guy initially offered me $500 for the binder. When I didn’t bite right away, he came back with $800. That jump kind of threw me off and made me feel like I might be missing something.

That’s when I figured I should slow down and do some research before making a decision.

  
So now I’m here. For vintage cards that *appear* to be in really strong condition:

• Is it generally worth grading with PSA?  
• Or is it smarter to sell raw and avoid the time / grading fees / risk?  
• Does an card shop bumping an offer like that usually mean they see bigger upside?

  
I’m not in a rush to sell. Just trying to figure out if I’m sitting on something meaningful or if this is just normal nostalgia value.

  
Appreciate any guidance.

1r5m4vk,https://www.reddit.com/r/naughtyconfessions_/comments/1r5m4vk/the_first_time_i_fucked_my_brother_in_law/,The first time I fucked my brother in law.,"My husband invited his older brother around for dinner, as his wife was in hospital, as he is hopeless in the kitchen. So I cooked us a dinner and we sat down and ate it whilst chatting, then I noticed they were whispering while I cleared up, but didn’t really think much about it. After dinner we went into the living room for coffee and I curled up next to my husband, the way I always did in the evenings, then after a few minutes, I was surprised to feel my husband’s hand on my tit, teasing my nipple until it got hard, it wasn’t unusual for him to do this as we have a great sexlife, and he usually did it, but only when we were alone, not in company. 

But this time we were sitting with his brother next to us and my husband was tweaking my aroused nipple, and his brother looking at us, then my brother in law said to my husband, you are one lucky man, she has fantastic tits and an ass that's just begging to be felt up, so don’t mind me carry on. Rather than telling his brother to shut up, my husband moved his hand down between my thighs and squeezed my pussy lightly, and said, her pussy is wonderfully tight, bro, just as I like them, as he smiled and kissed me.

His brother replied, I bet it is, then he said to me, are your gorgeous tits all real, I've been dying to get a feel of them ever since I met you. Then to my shock my husband said, honey, why don't we show my brother your lovely, real tits, you know you like to show them off, which with our sexual fun I show them off to guys quite often, but never to his family. My husband never left me any time to answer, and he just unbuttoned my blouse and then unhooked my lacy white bra, and I found myself sitting between my husband and his brother, wearing only my shorts, my tits on full view, and my nipples we’re erect and I could feel my pussy tingling watching his brothers face, he was almost dribbling looking at my tits, which I found quite erotic, and was turning me on terribly.

Then his brother said, mind if I, looking at my husband who smiled back at his brother in return,  then my brother in law cupped my tits and squeezed them around his face. He then started sucking on one of my nipples, making me even wetter than I already was, and I couldn’t help myself and I started moaning as he kissed, sucked and nibbled at my tits, and my husband pulled off the last of my clothes and knelt between my thighs. I soon felt my husband eating my shaved pussy while his brother was playing with my tits, and I felt so turned on, and in ecstasy my pussy was dripping. 

Then my husband’s tongue lapped up my juices before he settled his lips around my clit and started teasing it, my husband then grabbed one of his brothers hands and inserted two of his fingers inside my pussy. Fuck it felt great, and I moaned louder, as my husband and his brother were pleasuring me in a way I'd never imagined they would, and I'd never felt anything so erotic before in my life. I was enjoying this so much, and too soon my body betrayed me and I screamed out as my orgasm possessed my body. 

They both kept doing what they were doing until I'd stopped whimpering and started breathing normally again, then my brother in law pulled his fingers from my pussy and licked them, and said, you taste wonderful, and my husband said, he’s right, as he scooped up some of my pussy juices and licked it off his finger, and said to his brother, she has the sweetest pussy I've ever tasted.

Then my brother in law said, fuck, my cock is so hard I'm about to tear these jeans apart, and my husband said, you know how much you love cock honey, why don't you get his cock out for him, I looked at my husband who nodded at me encouragingly. So without being told twice, I slid down on the floor and positioned myself between my brother-in-law's legs, and unzipped his jeans and pulled out his cock, and thought I’m going to enjoy this, as it’s as long and thick as my husband’s, which I know so well from nightly fucking.

I looked at my husband again and he motioned for me to do to his brother what he himself loved so much, so I pulled his jeans open enough to get his full cock and his balls out. I then started sucking his balls, teasing them and tickling them with my tongue, before I licked the full length of his shaft until I reached his swollen cockhead and I cleared it of his precum. Then I finally wrapped my lips around his cock and I could tell that my brother in law was really enjoying it from his gasp. 

I sucked him in as deep as I could and then I kept him deep as my gagging reflexes did the work for me, as his moans got louder and louder as I deep throated him. I hadn't noticed that my husband had undressed next to us, and all of a sudden I felt him behind me and he was rubbing his hard cock along my wet pussy slit. As my head was bobbing up and down on his brother’s cock, my husband slowly penetrated me, filling me with his wonderful big cock, making me moan around his brothers in my mouth, and I felt his hands on my head, making sure I stayed focused on my task of sucking his cock.

My husband had grabbed my hips and was pumping his big cock in and out of my pussy, long deliberate strokes at first, but then harder and harder, faster and faster. His balls slammed into my swollen clit and I wanted to cry with enjoyment, but his brothers cock in my mouth stopped me from making much noise. I kept slurping around his cock and using my tongue to tease him as much as I could, and I had one hand wrapped around the base of his cock and the other hand cupping his heavy balls. My husband was slamming his cock into me fast and furiously, as he held my hips in position to make sure I felt the full size of him and with every penetration he stopped momentarily to grind himself into me, making sure that my entire pussy felt his presence.

My body started shaking and I cried out against my brother in law's cock as my husband's cock gave me an orgasm that I thought would never end. My husband then pulled out of me and pulled my face off his brother's cock, and kissed me deeply as his brother stripped off and lay on the floor. My husband then helped me straddle his brother, and guided me down on his rock hard cock, then stood and slid his cock into my mouth so that I could suck his pussy juice covered cock while riding his brother.

I sucked my husband's cock and moaned with pleasure, as his brothers cock was as delicious in my tight pussy as my husbands and the flavour of my own juices on my husband's cock turned me on even more than I already was. I was riding my brother In law like a woman possessed and my husband had to hold my face in place so that he could fuck my mouth. My husband was the first to cum, as his groans grew louder and louder and I sucked him as hard as I could, teasing him with my tongue and my hands. He grabbed my head tight and with a final thrust he shoved himself to the back of my throat and started shooting his cum into my mouth. When he finally let go, he pulled out and was still cummin and he shot some on my face and on my tits.

Once again a few seconds later my body shook and my pussy convulsed around my brother in law’s cock, I moaned out loud as my pussy squeezed his cock hard and the added pressure must have been what made him cum, as he grabbed my hips hard and forced himself all the way in me, and my throbbing pussy started milking his cum. My brother in law then said, that was fucking amazing, I can't wait to fuck you again, and my husband looked at me and said, thanks babe, I never mentioned it before, but he has wanted to fuck you for so long, I hope that you'll be happy to fuck both of us at times. I'd already married the most wonderful cock in the world and now I was going to get its brothers as well, and the thought of that made me feel like I had died and gone to heaven.",1,1771180394.0,naughtyconfessions_,0,1.0,False

I was initially set to buy Breville Barista Pro. I was pretty happy with the Infuser overall, and this seems like a logical replacement, even though I don’t really need the built-in grinder (I have a Smart Grinder Pro). It has a simple workflow, fast startup, hot water dispenser, so from usability pov it's pretty great, imo.

My main concern is reliability, though. I've read more than once that Brevilles aren’t really expected to last more than 5–7 years (this is likely anecdotal) and aren’t very repair-friendly. The technician I took my Infuser to literally said, “Don’t buy another Breville”, citing that they fail a lot and are not repairable. He suggested a Magister Stella Professional instead, which looks like a nice machine. It would cost me about 50% more than the Breville, but if it’s potentially the last machine I’ll need/buy, I’m fine with that. Also, if it'll be easier make a good coffee more consistently, that's a bonus :)

So I’m trying to figure out if the upgrade makes sense/worth it.

Is there a general consensus about the reliability of newer Brevilles? Was my Infuser atypical, or has the quality gone down? And is going to something like the Magister actually worth it long term?

For context, usually I make 1–2 lattes and 2–4 Americanos a day.

Also, I did look at Gaggia Classic Pro, Profitec Go, few Lelit models - in terms of features, Magister looks nicer.

K-dramas and romance - these two words are enough to attract a person's attention and make him/her engage for a whole. There have been many great romantic k-dramas released over the years: some stayed in the hearts of viewers; some made them cry, and some made them feel depressed and anxious long after the ending. From the peak romance of **'Crash Landing on You'**(2019), to the heartbreaking trauma of '**Uncontrollably Fond**'(2016) and to the OG **Coffee Prince (2007)**, we have seen more of romance full of purity in love from these dramas than an American drama or an Indian drama. However, there is one drama that literally created buzz on its release but has been under the radar for quite a while. It's '**Something in the rain**' (2018) and from this post, I want to request you all to try this because, even if it is not ranked higher or suggested, there is beauty in this drama that you would not want to miss.

Released in 2018, '**Something in the rain**' is a drama of two people of differences - both in age and family life - who fall in love. Heard before? Yes. So, what's new? Nothing. It just reinvigorates the true meaning of love and gives a new dimension to age-gap romance, which was explored very rarely (I'm not talking about **Goblin**, that's another level). There is poetry in the form of love between the lead couple, which has the ability to melt anybody's heart. There are also two side stories-tension within FL's family about the relationship and the sexual harassment cases in the company where FL works- that keeps the drama very much engaging. The makers have done a very good job in ensuring the balance between all the stories while maintaining the main essence of this drama. TBH, I'm very much impressed with the way it makes the viewer relate with real-life struggles in love.

In terms of cast performance, this drama hits it right into the slot. Son Ye-Jin and **Jung Hae-In**, as **Yoo-Jin Ah** and **Seo Joon-Hee** (that's what was written in subtitles), were completely mesmerizing as a couple. Romance only works when the chemistry between the leads work, and both of them not only perfected their chemistry, their romance was so real that for once I thought that they had also in fallen in love off the set (no pun intended). The love and respect they showed for each other, the struggles they faced in their relationship - everything looked real and not half-baked, which showed that sometimes, age-gap romance works. This drama proved to be a boon for both **Son Ye-Jin**, who experienced a resurgence in her golden career, and **Jung Hae-In**, who literally improved his skills from **'While you were sleeping**'(2017) and continued to star in hit dramas as a lead. The supporting cast, led by the experienced **Jang So Yeon**, were outstanding for most of the time, but they sometimes got overboard in terms of reacting to certain situations, which looked weird. Still, no issues in the acting department.

The OST is pretty much laid back, as only the title track of this drama and some of background music sounded good. But I had more expectations. The cinematography is, however, very much real and at times, beautiful to watch. The way the scenes were filmed, it was like watching all these scenes live.

Overall, it's **9/10** for me. Except some of the overdramatic workplace scenes and the fact that it could have been a 20-episode drama to flesh out the story even further, I think it's an excellent good drama to watch with your partner.

I just re-launched an iOS app called **Jotalyze.** I built it because I wanted a minimalism journaling experience in an app that is fully encrypted, private, and stored locally on my device that combines:

• various journal entry types  
• habit tracking with daily check-offs  
• goal tracking journaling with visual progress bars and completion counts  
• extensive analytics including streaks, visual pie charts based on my moods, timeline graphs of my mood over time, and writing analytics as well; would love to add more analytics and provide as many features as possible as time goes on or as ideas are recommended through reviews for what people would like to see!

My goal was to embrace a minimalism tone keeping it very simplistic and visually satisfying.

I felt that other apps, including some larger ones, were frustrating to navigate. You are sometimes forced to go through 6 views & questionnaires before you can finally start journaling. Alternatively, I kept Jotalyze as minimal as possible to let you select your journal type, begin writing, and keep everything organized under such journal types in your personal private feed.

I wanted the UI of a high-end journaling app while keeping the simplicity of Apple Journal.

Journal Types:

\- Morning Preparation: prepare for a productive day

\- Evening Reflection: reflect on your day

\- Mood Check-In: the general journaling style; select your mood, jot your thoughts, and get visual analytics in pie charts and line graphs

\- Gratitude: note what you're thankful for

\- Goal Tracking: journal about how goals went, see visual analytics fill progress bars and completion counts

\- Capture The Moment: take or upload a picture and reflect on the moment

Right now all current features are **free for life** (as long as you don't delete the app and re-install when a later premium version comes out; when updating the app you will still receive all current features forever)

First, I never used any alcohol stove, excpet a DIY with can just for fun, but not used in real word :)

I'm using a gas Primus Trail kit (1l pot) mostly on kayaking trips with friends, where everyone is cooking for themselves. I would say 1l pot is even overkill for my water boiling needs. I could go smaller with a mini fry pan and/or folding grill.

I'm very interested of leavnig gas. I love the idea of wood stove when we arrive early at camp site. But I think most of the time, I'd use the alcohol stove.

I've seen people with Trangia (or other brand) with Firebox folding stove. But I'm not sure how it's efficient with wind.

I'm wondering if anyone here are using that kind of wood stove boxes with an alcohol stoves.

I'm looking at Trangia since it seems to most reliable one, and you can leave alcohol in there (usefull when you cook for diner but you know you'll be using it just for a cup of coffee the next morning).

I still have a lot of think to learn about these systems.. especially how much alcohol we need to bring for a 3 to 5 days kayaking trip, given I'm using it in the morning and for dinner only.

I would not want to have a kit larger than my Primus kit + pan.

So, she's a pre-transition trans woman (32TF), let's call her June. I met June when I started working in a secondhand store (really low payment but all the staff and audience are old friends and I love being there). She visits each of us every day, bringing us coffee, sweets and other treats, cuz she knows we all don't earn much. June is in IT, so she earns well and can afford it. She's really cuddly and we can sit on the floor for two hours straight and just cuddle. I call her my beauty and my girl when nobody hears us. 

I noticed how over time, my attitude towards her changed. When June enters the store, I'm jumping up and down, whispering ""my beauty"" in her ear, tugging her to cuddle on the floor, trying to give her gifts or nurture her in other ways. June refuses because she says she is ""egoistic and loves making people happy"". This unconditional dynamic is new for me and I'm sometimes anxious because affirming my bond with people helps me with my abandonment issues. 

I noticed myself getting whiny and requesting headpats, or talking in a small voice to her, asking my stupid autistic questions, like ""why can't we print more money?"", and she always answers, doesn't judge me. I nuzzle her hair because it's cold in the store and my nose is freezing. With June, silence doesnt scare me. I wanna cuddle with her properly, like, in bed, or sit in her lap. I don't quite feel she's an older figure, I just... act silly and can't help it. My body aches when she's not holding me. I'm jumping up and down at the thought June is gonna visit me in the store. 

I've never felt like this towards anyone, even my ex-partner. Is this how having a caregiver feels? I mean, I'm not imposing this role on her, but I kinda think that one day, I could trust her enough to ask for helping me with my feeding bottle? 

Here's the pic of June and I. She, sitting on the chair and installing dozens of Minecraft mods on my laptop. Me, sitting on the floor, holding her hand and nuzzling her lap and demanding headpats.",12,1771179813.0,ageregression,1,0.93,False

But in 2026? That's cute. Real knowledge now is about connecting dots faster than AI, thinking critically when everyone's drowning in information, and actually applying what you learn instead of just hoarding it in your brain like a digital packrat.

I've spent the last few years reverse engineering how genuinely smart people (not just degree hoarders) actually learn. Dug through neuroscience research, interviewed people who seem to know everything about everything, and tested strategies from books, podcasts, and YouTube rabbit holes. Here's what actually works when you want to level up your brain game.

The truth is, most of us were never taught how to learn. We were taught to memorize and regurgitate. Schools optimized us for standardized tests, not for actually absorbing and synthesizing knowledge. Add social media's destruction of our attention spans, and you've got a generation that consumes information but retains almost nothing. But once you understand how your brain actually works and what's hijacking it, you can flip the script.

## Step 1: Build Your Knowledge Operating System First

You can't become dangerously knowledgeable if your brain is a messy filing cabinet. Most people consume content randomly, read books they forget a week later, watch educational videos that evaporate from memory. You need a system.

Start with Obsidian or Notion as your second brain. Every piece of knowledge you consume gets processed through your system. Read something interesting? Summarize it in your own words. Watched a killer YouTube video? Extract the core concepts. This isn't about creating pretty notes. It's about forcing your brain to actively process instead of passively consume.

The key is the Zettelkasten method, which sounds fancy but basically means: Make atomic notes (one idea per note), link related concepts together, and review regularly. Your brain remembers through connections, not isolation. When you link ""cognitive biases"" to ""marketing psychology"" to ""personal relationships,"" suddenly you're seeing patterns everywhere.

Here's the brutal part: If you can't explain something simply, you don't actually understand it. So after you consume anything, write a 3 sentence summary like you're explaining it to a smart 12 year old. Can't do it? You didn't really learn it.

## Step 2: Read Like Your Life Depends on It (Because It Kind Of Does)

Books are still the highest ROI knowledge source, period. One book represents years of someone's expertise compressed into 300 pages. But here's the catch, you're probably reading wrong.

""[How to Read a Book](https://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Book-Classic-Intelligent/dp/0671212095)"" by Mortimer Adler is the meta book that teaches you how to actually extract knowledge from books. Adler was a philosopher and educator who literally wrote the book (pun intended) on reading comprehension. This thing won the National Book Award and it's basically the instruction manual for your brain that school never gave you. Most people skim or read passively. Adler breaks down analytical reading, syntopical reading (reading multiple books on the same topic to compare ideas), and how to have a conversation with the author. After reading this, I realized I'd been wasting hundreds of hours on books I barely remembered. This book will make you question everything you think you know about reading. Insanely good.

Don't just read one genre. Dangerous knowledge comes from cross pollination. Read psychology, then business, then philosophy, then biology. The magic happens when you connect ""antifragile"" from Nassim Taleb to evolutionary biology to your own life decisions.

Speed reading is mostly bullshit, by the way. You can't speed read your way to deep knowledge. What works is reading with purpose. Before opening any book, ask yourself: What specific question am I trying to answer? Then hunt for those answers aggressively.

## Step 3: Become a Master Learner, Not a Content Consumer

There's a massive difference between consuming information and actually learning. Learning requires active engagement. Neuroscience shows that retrieval practice (testing yourself) is exponentially more effective than passive review.

After reading a chapter, close the book and write down everything you remember. It'll feel uncomfortable. You'll realize you retained maybe 20%. That discomfort is where learning happens. Then go back and fill in gaps.

Use spaced repetition through apps like Anki. Your brain forgets information predictably over time (the forgetting curve), but if you review at specific intervals, you can hack this. Anki uses algorithms to show you information right before you're about to forget it. Medical students use this to memorize thousands of facts. You can use it for anything.

The Feynman Technique is your other weapon. Named after physicist Richard Feynman, it's dead simple: Pick a concept. Teach it to someone (or pretend you are). When you get stuck, that's your knowledge gap. Go back, relearn that part, then teach it again. Repeat until you can explain it smoothly.

## Step 4: Curate Your Information Diet Like a Psycho

You are what you consume, mentally. If you're scrolling TikTok for 3 hours daily, your brain is getting optimized for dopamine hits, not deep thinking. Time to get militant about your inputs.

Unsubscribe from 90% of everything. Most newsletters, YouTube channels, podcasts, and social media accounts are just noise. Keep only the absolute S tier sources that consistently teach you something valuable.

For podcasts, Huberman Lab is non negotiable. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist at Stanford and his podcast dives deep into how your brain and body actually work. We're talking sleep optimization, dopamine regulation, learning protocols, all backed by legitimate research. Each episode is like a free college course. He breaks down complex neuroscience into actionable protocols you can use immediately.

YouTube is actually underrated for knowledge if you're selective. Channels like Veritasium (science and critical thinking), Ali Abdaal (productivity and learning), and Lex Fridman's interviews with world class thinkers are goldmines.

If you want to go deeper but struggle with finding time or energy to read through dozens of books and research papers, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) might be worth checking out. It's an AI powered learning app built by Columbia alumni and former Google engineers that turns books, research, and expert content into personalized audio podcasts.

You can literally type in something like ""I want to master critical thinking and spot cognitive biases in my daily life"" and it'll pull from psychology books, neuroscience research, and expert talks to create a custom learning plan with episodes tailored to your exact goal. The depth control is clutch, you can toggle between a quick 10 minute overview or a 40 minute deep dive with examples when something really hooks you. Plus the voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a smoky, sarcastic narrator that makes complex topics way more engaging during commutes or gym sessions. Makes it easier to actually retain what you're learning instead of just passively consuming.

Kill your news addiction. Daily news is designed to make you anxious and uninformed. Read weekly summaries instead, or better yet, read books about historical events and you'll understand the present way better than watching CNN.

## Step 5: Build a Learning Routine That Sticks

Knowledge without consistency is just random trivia. You need a daily learning routine that's so easy you can't say no.

My non negotiable: One hour every morning before any distractions. 30 minutes reading, 15 minutes processing notes, 15 minutes reviewing spaced repetition cards. That's it. Seven hours a week compounds into hundreds of hours yearly.

Use implementation intentions: ""When I drink my morning coffee, I will read for 30 minutes."" Your brain loves these if-then patterns. Attach learning to existing habits.

Interleaving is another neuroscience backed technique. Don't study one topic for hours. Mix it up. Study psychology for 30 minutes, then switch to history, then philosophy. Feels less efficient but actually creates stronger neural pathways.

## Step 6: Learn in Public and Test Your Knowledge

Here's where most people fail. They consume and consume but never output. Learning in public forces clarity.

Start a blog, Twitter thread, or YouTube channel where you explain what you're learning. Sounds scary? Good. Fear means growth. You don't need to be an expert. Just share what you learned this week. Teaching forces you to organize your thoughts and exposes gaps in your understanding.

Join communities where smart people hang out. Reddit's r/lectures, r/philosophy, and niche subreddits for whatever you're learning. Engage in discussions. When someone challenges your understanding, that's free feedback on your knowledge gaps.

Apply what you learn immediately. Read about negotiation? Negotiate something today. Learn about cognitive biases? Spot them in your own thinking. Knowledge that doesn't connect to action is just entertainment.

## Step 7: Embrace Intellectual Humility (The Secret Weapon)

The most dangerously knowledgeable people know how much they don't know. Dunning Kruger effect means beginners overestimate their competence while experts understand complexity.

""[Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-and-Slow/dp/0374533555)"" by Daniel Kahneman is essential here. Kahneman won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on cognitive biases and decision making. This book reveals how your brain tricks you constantly, how you're way less rational than you think, and how to recognize these patterns. Fair warning, this book is dense but it's the best book I've ever read on how human thinking actually works versus how we think it works. After reading it, you'll never trust your gut the same way again.

Always ask: What could I be wrong about? What's the strongest argument against my position? This makes you intellectually antifragile.

Seek out people smarter than you and ask questions. Most people are flattered when you genuinely want to learn from them. Email that author whose book changed your life. Comment thoughtfully on that YouTuber's video. You'd be surprised how accessible knowledge holders are.

## Step 8: Develop Your Unique Knowledge Stack

The real competitive advantage isn't being the best at one thing. It's combining multiple skills and knowledge areas in unique ways. Scott Adams (Dilbert creator) calls this ""talent stacking.""

Maybe you're pretty good at psychology, decent at writing, and understand basic statistics. Combine those and suddenly you can create compelling data driven content about human behavior. That's a rare combination.

Build your stack intentionally. Pick 3-5 domains that interest you and go deep. Don't try to know everything about everything. That's shallow knowledge. Go for T shaped knowledge: Deep in a few areas, broad understanding of many.

The dangerous part comes from unexpected combinations. Steve Jobs combined calligraphy with technology. Elon Musk combines physics with business with engineering. What weird combinations can you create?

---

Real talk: This isn't a fast process. You're not going to become dangerously knowledgeable in a month. But in a year of consistent daily learning? You'll be unrecognizable. While everyone else is mindlessly scrolling, you'll be building a knowledge base that compounds.

1r5lrvr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r5lrvr,I lost 8lbs in 4 days eating only sardines,"I love sardines, I grew up on them. I'm from Brazil and sardines is part of our culinary (Portuguese influence). I started on Tuesday (2/10) at 2pm first can, at 144 lbs and by (2/14) Saturday morning, I was 136lbs. I'm turning 51 on Feb 24, 5'8"" and perimenopausal. My weight goal is 130lbs.

I work during the week, and I find it easier to do the fast on weekdays than weekends. I drank black coffee, tea, mild laxatives, and water only.

I love carbs, wine and pasta are my biggest temptations.

I am active, but I do over-exercise. I garden, I clean, I work standing to minimize sitting. I sleep 8-9 hrs a night. I don't eat fast food. if I want a burger and fries im making them grass fed and organic at home. I use a vibration plate for 10 mins everyday. I also take baths with at least 5 cups of Epson salt to help with water weight and detox.

it is recommended to eat 100gms of sardines per body weight. I ate one can a day with extra virgen olive oil and felt full and satisfied.

Pros...My weight went down, bloat disappeared, my hair is stronger and does not shed, my skin is  glowing,it is easy to do and low cost. My lower back pain was also minimized. Cons.. I did burp sardines for two days, but as bile increases, that went away.

Today, Sunday, I ate one can of sardines in olive oil and lemon to start the day.

1r5lr2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/sahm/comments/1r5lr2v/how_to_entertain_a_5_month_old_as_an_extremely/,How to ‘entertain’ a 5 month old as an extremely burnt out SAHM?,"Yes, I know ‘entertain’ is not really the correct word to use for a 5 month old. I just worry he’s getting very bored being at home with just me 5 days a week. The first 3 1/2 months of his life, I felt like super-mom. Had a ridiculous amount of energy to get things done and spend quality time and loved every second of it. However, I’ve recently hit a wall. Perhaps im depressed but im definitely exhausted. (I am seeing a psychiatrist trying to get a hold on things).. The days are blurring together and I can tell my baby wants to do more than just floor time, time in the swing, grabbing for different toys, etc. I also deal with a lot of chronic pain and have been having some horrible flare-ups recently so even getting down on the floor with him can be a challenge. I’ve been feeling an insane amount of guilt since introducing Ms Rachel to him on the tv a few weeks ago… it makes him happy and occupied for the time being and I can at least lay down, drink coffee, let my meds kick in before peeling myself up off the couch to try to salvage the day! But it makes me feel so horrible and like im rotting his brain or something. I’ve done research and understand there is no direct correlation between tv time and any developmental challenges as long as he is still receiving connection&love.. but it doesn’t feel right but at the same time I am so low energy, don’t have a huge village to help me out so im just trying my best but I feel really bad about it. He is rolling over, grabbing things, rocking back and forth a bit trying to crawl, getting better at sitting up by himself, babbling/coo-ing/squealing, hitting all milestones on time. 

I look up all day ways to entertain him. I put random items in zip-lock baggies and let him explore the textures. I fill a baking dish with water and throw him over a pillow and let him splash around and pick things out. I carry him around and let him look at random stuff. I’ve been reading more books to him. I “narrate’ all the things I do. I squeal back and forth with him. I let him sit and watch me do stuff around the house while I talk to him. But all these activities are lucky to last 5 minutes then we have the entire rest of the day!!! I can tell he wants to be able to do more but his little body just has limited capabilities right now :( and im extremely exhausted and also very nervous as a FTM that im not enriching him enough.. \*\*\*

TLDR: feeling very guilty about putting the tv on sometimes for my 5 month old but im hitting an extreme point of exhaustion and looking for some fun but not too stimulating activities for him.

Does anyone have any activities they like/liked doing with their baby around 5 months old? Maybe something ‘niche’ that you wouldn’t really think of? Thanks everyone. ",2,1771179528.0,sahm,9,0.75,False
1r5lqtu,https://i.redd.it/uzqqvzf1apjg1.jpeg,Slice of Nothing,"*Two stars trailed across the sky, one a brilliant blue, the other an eclipsed red. The two burned brighter than any stars before or after, lazily drifting across the dark canvas as if looking for something. They hung in the air above Calarakis, and faded as the morning sun rose above the horizon.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What is this?**

*Two people stood on the corner of a crowded intersection, people rushed by to go from here to there, to go shopping, exploring, simply wandering around. And these two simply stood there, having nowhere to be.*

*They looked similar, like one had modelled their form after the other, but was less specific. One was more defined, features stable, the other was not. Their features seemed to shift constantly, ever so slightly, hair longer, somewhere between brown and blonde. Two things remained constant however, the stable one was always just a few centimeters taller, and their eyes. One had unbroken blue, the other had red spliced with black.*

It is coffee. Drink, it won't kill you.

**Not a lot can.**

*The shorter one put the cup to their mouth, and took a sip. It was bitter, hot, and vaguely energizing. Their eyes widened, and they took a much larger sip, emptying the cup.*

Ha! I assume you like it?

**It is... Acceptable.**

Uh huh. Want another?

**Yes please.**

*The two walked around the corner, and through the door. While the taller went to the til and ordered two lattes, the shorter marveled at the interior, like they had never seen a coffee shop before. A few minutes later, the two walked out, one drink already almost gone.*

So, what do you want to see next?

**Where do people go to relax?**

Well that depends on the person. I go to the park and feed ducks.

**What is a, Pah-ruk?**

I'll show you.

*The two begin to lazily walk through the street, letting the people guide them to where they wished to go.*

First things first though, we need food.

**Why? We don't eat.**

Not for us, for the ducks.

**I understand. The ducks will be satiated.**

*Before long the two arrive at a supermarket. The taller one led the way, considering they knew what frozen pees are. The shorter meanwhile, was lost in the colours of the stock. Once they had found the frozen pees, they went to the til and payed for them, as well as an empty box, several slices of ham, and two sandwiches.*

**What is the purpose of the others?**

*The two slowly make their way to the nearest park.*

To consume. We don't need to eat, but we can if we want to.

**I see. We will consume with the ducks.**

*Finding the park was easy, finding the pond was not. The two wander amongst the green for some time before spotting their target. A pond spreads out across the length of the park, making the two wonder why it took them so long to find it. A gathering of ducks rest at the edge.*

**These are the ducks you spoke of? They are not what I expected. Are not birds meant to have sharp beaks?**

Some are, some are not.

*A look of understanding passed over the shorter one's eyes as the two sat on the grass near the bank. With one fluid motion the bag of pees was sliced open.*

Do as I do, like so.

*The taller one took a small handful of less frozen pees, and tossed them at the pond. The ducks happily ate them all. The shorter did the same, taking more pees, and scattering them towards the lake. Once again the ducks are them all.*

**They are strange creatures. I can see why you do this to relax.**

Yeah. Hungry?

*The taller opened the box and pulled out the ham and sandwiches.*

**No, but I am curious.**

*The shorter took a bite of the sandwich, and once again their eyes widened. The sandwich was gone in a blink. The taller simply smiled, and passed the ham while taking a bite of their own sandwich. The ham too was consumed.*

**This new world, it is much greater than the one before.**

Indeed it is.

**But I don't understand. Why come here?**

Why not? You wished to see the world and I took you to part of it.

**You cannot lie to me. Why are we really here?**

*The taller grew silent, staring off into the distance at something beyond the edges of normal sight.*

Someone lives in this place. Someone I called a friend, someone I let down.

**Mmm...**

*Another handful of pees splashed into the pond.*

**Do you still care?**

Of course I do.

**Then you will go. Once the ducks are satisfied and our supplies are dwindled, you will go to this someone, and you will talk.**

Why? I hurt him once I'll just hurt him again.

**If you leave it like this then you will. If you can salvage this bond then you must try.**

*More flung pees, more happy ducks.*

**You should not leave something broken because you think it can't be fixed.**

But what if it can't be fixed?

**Then you will have tried, and that is better than not.**

*A moment of silence passed, broken only by the sound of happy quacking.*

Will you be okay on your own?

**I survived isolation for longer than empires can dream. I will survive being alone with the ducks for a while.**

Good point.

**Now enough of this for now. You are not eating your sandwich and you are not feeding the ducks.**

*The taller one smiled, and took the bag, throwing now just cold pees at an ever growing group of ducks.*",18,1771179512.0,wizardposting,13,0.89,False

My roomate 25f and me 27m have a touchy relationship where we don’t do anything besides cuddling and a bit of teasing. She also doesn’t mind me listening to her when she’s masturbating

Some days ago she went out, it was a hasty plan cause on the day she was going out she told me in the morning that she told me that she is meeting one of her school friends as they are in the city, but I know that she didn’t

She left around 9 and had dinner and drinks (5/6 glasses of wine- more than enough for her to be crazy drunk ) . And then she told me that she’s just gonna drop him off to his place (this is at 1am) as he is very drunk to drive and have to call someone to drive them to his place .

They reached there at 2am and then she called me for 20seconds- I could hear the door close on the call and she said she’ll be back in an hour.she just wanted to get coffee at his place and if I want to sleep I can’t put the key .

Now exactly at 3am she calls me asking if I’m awake and that she’s on the way home. When she reaches I see that she’s drunk. I don’t know what happened but she’s always said that she actually met a friend and nothing happened. Am I overthinking this.
