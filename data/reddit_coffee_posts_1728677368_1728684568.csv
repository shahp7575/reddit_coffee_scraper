I know it is inexpensive, but I feel like even at it's first Espresso setting ( 20 ) the grind size is possibly too fine. e.g. I just started using a new bean from Sawada Coffee ( Project X ) and the extraction just stalls or takes too long, e.g. sometime even 0.5 gm/s. 

Other than going coarser what else can I do? 

Some diag info : 

* Puck is wet when done
* sometimes only half of the portafilter is dripping
* My usual dosage is 17.9 gm 
* I have a Gaggia classic pro. 
* The espresso is VERY bitter but lots of crema available.

It's part of a long, strange trip I've been on for the past eight or so years. I end up compulsively listening to the channel on YouTube and I figured maybe put it here, because I have to put it somewhere.

I grew up one of many kids my mom (F59) had over the years. I was her fourth, and after me she had another eight (six pregnancies, two sets of twins) and I don't honestly think any of those kids but the twins have the same parents. I realize I sound judgmental here, but growing up like this was an exercise in enduring torture. From the time I was four, all I can remember is a rotating door of new 'uncles' and having to assistant parent all these babies she was having. By the time I was twelve I had half-sibs ranging from 9 to 2 years old that I had to take care of because she was out somewhere with her newest man, drinking and doing God knows what else. Sometimes her parents would help, but they were pretty worn out by then. My oldest half-sib was born when she was fifteen, he's M44 and was already gone by the time I was born. I barely even know him or the other two, her first set of twins. They're in their 30's. Most of my life was spent in a haze of watching her meet, fall in love, get pregnant, then either cheat or be cheated on and break up over and over again. She was pregnant with her 12th kid when I left, she was 38. 

Now, she wasn't cruel. She didn't beat us, or anything like that. She was actually affectionate, as best she could be, and when she was sober she'd be apologetic and would try to be there. But then the self loathing would kick in, and then she'd go get drunk and meet the next guy who was going to fix everything. When I moved out at 18, I had to cut ties with her just to keep from being dragged back into permanent nanny status. It felt bad leaving the kids, but they aren't MY kids, they're HER kids, I shouldn't have to parent all of them. My grandparents tried, and some of the kids had fathers who actually paid child support, and she did manage to cut back on drinking and give up whatever party drugs she was doing after I wasn't around to do the job for her.

I went NC with her because I didn't want to have to raise any more of her kids -- she's up to 14 or so now, the last four in the decade since I moved out. I know I'm irrational about it but I resent her so much. I'm livid when I think about what my life was like, no idea who my dad was, my mom barely even there and usually a weeping drunk or high mess when she was, so many babies for me to clean and feed and take care of. I was four and I had to start helping with my brother (he moved to California years ago but he does still send me mother's day cards) and then the next and the next. I didn't have time to have friends growing up. I didn't even know this wasn't normal until much later.

This poisoned my brain, really. I had (and am still trying to unlearn) really unhealthy attitudes towards sex and love and relationships. When I was 22, I was in my first serious long term relationship with an objectively awesome guy (m32), I've called him 'David' in the other posts I've written so I'll keep using that name. David and I were not quite moved in yet but were getting there when one bad night happened, he had to go to work overnight at his second grocery store job and I ended up hanging out with his brother Sam (M33) and Sam's friends. I got blackout drunk -- I did not drink much, due to hating how my mom had always been drunk, and didn't know my limits. I woke up the next morning naked in Sam's bed, in the wet spot of what I took to be confirmation that I was the same as my mom. This destroyed me, and I spent the next six or so years just hating myself for being a stupid drunk slut who cheated on my boyfriend and worse, couldn't even remember doing it. 

I told David, he tried to get past it but he and his brother were almost at war for obvious reasons -- I mean, it was Sam's bed and he was nowhere to be found when I woke up -- and when I found out I was pregnant I just couldn't fucking deal with it. Not with any of it. So I broke the lease I had, went and lived in my grandparent's backward shed for a month, got found out and they made me move in with them. As much as they'd been burned to the wick by mom and her whole disaster show, they really did try to help all of their grandkids. I wasn't sure what to do -- do I have the baby? Do I terminate the pregnancy? Do I give it up for adoption? Should I contact David, he knew where I was and was trying to get my grandparents to tell me he still wanted to work on us, and say 'Hey, I'm pregnant, and I'm pretty sure it's not yours' because sober me was and is obsessive about birth control?

Then I lost it. Almost four months in. Miscarriage, they call it. To me, it felt like stomach cramps. Then I went to the bathroom and saw all the blood and passed out, and when I woke up, I wasn't pregnant anymore.  Kind of went catatonic after that. 

We'll be here all day and I've written other posts about all this. I moved north to a bigger city in another state, worked a variety of crap jobs. Eventually finished my bachelor's in history. Work a better paying gig as a researcher now, I work remotely so I moved back home to be closer to my grandparents as they're heading towards 90 and I worry. I reconnected with some of my sibs -- my half brother in California and my half sister (f20) who actually still lives with mom, Chloe and I look a lot alike, and we both look a lot like mom, although I sit in front of a computer for most of every day and Chloe plays volleyball in college. And yeah, I've helped pay her tuition over the years when my grandparents couldn't handle the expense and my mom was drunk and couldn't pay her own rent.

Yes, I've also paid her rent. She doesn't know that. She thinks her parents have picked up the slack, but they don't really have the money anymore. That one isn't specifically her fault, just the way things are.

I honestly don't know how to describe my relationship with my mom. I mean, I don't hate her as a person, but the very idea that I'm like her in any way makes me almost suicidal. Like, after I lost the baby the idea that I was now a drunk slut who'd lost a baby just put me back into watching her lose one on the kitchen floor while she was too drunk to get up and having to wrestle her upright and onto the couch before calling 911. But she has worked to clean herself up, and although she's pregnant again (yes, at 59, she's like some avatar of fertility) this time she's not doing it to try and fix a broken relationship. This will be baby 14. We don't talk much, she and I. My mom, not the baby, I haven't spoken to the fetus at all. 

Sorry. Rambling. This past month. I found out I didn't sleep with David's brother, that Sam had put me in his bed because he was too drunk to work the door to David's room and gone out pub crawling with all of his friends, and that one of those friends borrowed Sam's keys on the pretense of having left his keys in the apartment and, in Sam's words, ""You were so unconscious there was no way you could have consented to anything"" so, yeah. Turns out I got SA'd and I didn't even know it. Sam and David had reconnected finally, David told Sam he knocked me up, Sam said *Excuse me what now* and then reached out to me with the story. David literally blew my phone up trying to reconnect, I met up with him, we talked and it was nice and then suddenly I'm spending every night with him and we're dating. Is it healthy? I have no idea, but probably not. And honestly I don't care, I'm happy for the first time in years.

But in the back of my head there was something roaring that I couldn't figure out. And of all people, it was my mom who did.

Chloe called me up and asked me to pick her up, her car was dead and she needed a ride to school -- she lives in the largest city in our state but her college is about as far away as you can get, which isn't really *that* far but it's further than she could walk. (We live in New England, put it that way.) I'm not super jazzed about going to my mom's house, but I get out of my warm bed with my warm boyfriend who keeps proposing to me (no, David, not for at least a year, we have got to get counseling because this is going so so fast but every time he says it I light up like a happy, aroused Christmas tree) and I drive over to the house that made my neuroses. 

Chloe is running late -- it's her biggest vice and it's one I share but in me it causes constant layers of scheduling because doing research for a living means you get that shit done on time. In her it causes rampant abuse of her clock's znooze button. That's not a typo, that's what she calls it. I'm sitting in the car for like ten minutes and just kind of listening to my iPhone through the car when someone knocks on my window.

It is she who bore me herself. The past decade has made some lines she didn't used to have, but for a woman almost sixty she looks good. Her eyes are a little watery, her smile a bit tired. I guess that's what being pregnant at her age looks like. It's so weird to see her, we haven't exchanged more than thirty words in the past decade. She asks if I want some coffee while Chloe gets her stuff together.

I don't know why I said yes. I don't know why I went into the house, or sat in the kitchen. It's cleaner now. Faded a bit. Felt smaller. I took the coffee, thanked her, took a sip. She ruined it with non dairy creamer like she always did. She tries to make small talk, it's awkward, talks about nothing in particular. Asks me how I am. My brain disengages mouth control and something like the following comes spilling out.

""Well, I'm happier than I've been in years because I found out I got r4p#d a few years back.

And then it just sat there. She was looking at me, I was looking at her, and I couldn't get my brain to re-engage and I just started shaking. And then there she was, wrapped around me, smelling like that fabric softener she overuses and I can feel her crying and I'm crying and I don't fucking even know what *happened*. It all just hit me that I'd been violated, that someone had ripped my clothes off while I was too drunk to move or fight them off and done that to me, and all the pain and trauma that I didn't even know I had was just flooding the area around me because I couldn't stop and of all people it was *her* hugging me and reassuring me and talking. Talking in this voice I've never heard her use.

My first brother? The one I barely know? His dad forced himself on her in a car on their way to A&W.  She didn't paint her entire life like that -- plenty of the shit I remember she copped to, admitted she'd always been a shit mother and not just to me, to all of the kids, to Chloe and Mark (California brother) and she hated herself and knew she was using that to be an even worse mother. Just this agonized confession and telling me how none of the things I felt about myself were true, that I was and had always been such a good, smart girl and she really did love me even if she'd never been able to let herself be a good mom. And the weirdest part was how much I needed to hear it. 

That was Wednesday. Chloe ended up getting a cab and afterwards we talked on the phone and I apologized and she told me not even, that Mom had told her some of what they'd talked about but had tried not to tell her too much so I told her the whole thing. I climbed into bed with David and we just slept and he held me and I said yes just to fuck with him, but I don't think I was? But we're still not going to make that official until we both get counseling. 

I have no idea if I'm going to let my mom back in my life. She didn't ask. I've always thought of her a certain way, and that's still there, but when I was breaking apart she kept me together and she shared her own experiences and told me things I needed to hear from the only person who I wouldn't expect to lie just to make me feel better. 

So yeah, that's my life now. Nothing is what I thought it was. ",1,1728684202.0,MarkNarrations,0,1.0,False

but sometimes, just sometimes, i feel insanely insecure. until my midteens, i was very tomboyish and didn't like skirts, pink, or whatever. i had my internalised misogyny phase and didn't think i was attractive, but i was content with thinking i was perfectly average. the boys who had crushes on me? i'd just thought it was because of my personality and that was it. then i started dressing up more, loving pink, and really feeling more confident in my own femininity. this is when my insecurities started. the more attention i got, the more insecure i became. the looks i'd get from men in public, the way they'd look me up and down, the way they'd approach me. 

i started thinking my appearance was my only asset, which was a full 180 from what i'd believed before (my personality). insecurity became disordered eating and that became a full-blown eating disorder for years. then i became insecure about becoming too skinny, that i was losing my value as a woman. thankfully, i am doing much better than before with my eating and body image.

however, once i became sexually active, i felt i had another asset: sex. i believed the best thing i could offer to someone interested in me was sex, because they were obviously only into me from physical attraction. somehow, i had ended up objectifying myself like the men who approached me. i'm distrustful of men who approach me. i feel like they don't care about who i am as a person, but what i look like. they don't know about how i love playing soulslikes and reading books about my favorite artists. how i cry to lilo and stitch every time i watch it. or how my favorite ice cream flavor is coffee. they just see a pretty girl.

Two days ago T stops me after class and asks if I'd like to get coffee sometime. Apparently, he had messaged me twice before already asking the same thing through an app my school uses for clubs (I had my notifications turned off and just didn't see the messages). Both messages were along the lines of, ""I think you're very pretty and interesting; I'd love to get to know you over coffee sometime."" I thought he was very attractive and was elated that the feeling was mutual. We exchanged instagram handles and set up a date for Friday (today). 

However, this past Wednesday was the first time me and T really talked. Which is not a huge deal - dates are for getting to know each other - except that I had assumed T was somewhere between 20 or 23 at the oldest. 

It's only been three days, but he's said a few things that kind of worry me - like, ""So, I need you to settle a bet I have with myself - you're either 18 or 19."" And he seems a bit immature for his age. I know people can have any interest at any age, but he mentioned that he plays roblox, he's struggling to keep up his GPA (he should have graduated last year, but he didn't have the required 2.5 GPA), and he's already mentioned conspiracy theories (like the fire in Hawaii being caused intentionally by lasers). On top of all this, he's on a student visa which will expire once he finishes this semester. Even if we were a perfect match, he'll be on the other side of the globe in 4 months. 

And lastly... he's moving WAY too fast for me. Good morning and good night texts, checking in multiple times throughout the day, and making plans for future dates (before our first date!). He held my hand for our entire car ride home and went in for a kiss as I was getting out. I don't know if that's standard for first dates, but it feels like he's treating things like we're already in a relationship, and I'm still just trying to get to know him.

","# BASICS OF ISLAM : Slavery. Part1

# Q:  Why does Islam Allow Slavery?

**There are historical, social, and psychological dimensions to this question. First, the very word slavery conjures up revulsion, sorrow, and deep disgust, especially when we remember how slaves were treated in ancient Rome and Egypt. Pictures of people building the pyramids, of gladiators fighting each other to the death for the spectators' amusement, and of people bound by shameful yokes and chains around their necks come to mind when we hear that word.**

Nearer to our own time, we have the western European variety of slavery. The barbarity and bestiality of this enormous trade beggars all description. The trade was principally in Africans who were transported across the oceans, packed in specially designed ships, and considered and treated as livestock. These slaves were forced to change their names, abandon their religion and language, deprived of all hope for freedom, and were kept for labor or breeding purposes. A birth among them was celebrated as if it were a death.

It is difficult to understand how human beings could conceive of fellow human beings in such a light, still less treat them thus. But it certainly happened. Documentary evidence shows, for example, how shipmasters would throw their human cargo overboard to claim compensation for their loss. Slaves had no legal or other rights, but only obligations. Their owners had the absolute right to dispose of them as they wished—brothers and sisters, parents and children, were separated or allowed to stay together according to the owner's mood or economic convenience.

Centuries of this dreadful practice made western Europe rich from its slave-based exploitation of such commodities as sugar, cotton, coffee. When it abolished slavery, first as a trade and then altogether with much self-congratulation, only the slave-owners were compensated. In other words, the attitudes that made slavery possible remained.

Not many years after its abolition, Africa was colonized by western Europe with consequences for the Africans no less terrible than slavery itself. Moreover, because their attitude to non-Europeans has changed little, if at all, the slaves' descendants continue to live in poor social and political conditions. Those who live amid Europeans remain despised inferiors. Anthropological museums in western European capitals only closed their public displays of bones and stuffed bodies of fellow (but non-white) human beings several decades ago—displays that had been organized by European scientists, doctors, learned people, and humanitarians.

**In short**, the institution of slavery disgusts the human heart, as do the attitudes of inhumanity that sustain it. If the institution no longer formally exists but the attitudes persist, can we say that humanity has made any progress? This is why colonial exploitation replaced slavery, and why the chains of unbearable, unrepayable international debt have replaced colonial exploitation. Slavery has disappeared, but its inhuman and barbarous structures are still securely in place.

**Before we turn to the Islamic perspective on slavery, let's recall a name famous even among western Europeans: Harun al-Rashid.** 

This ruler, who enjoyed such authority and power over Muslims, was the son of a slave. Nor is he the only such example. Slaves and their children enjoyed enormous prestige, authority, respect, and (shall we say it) freedom within the Islamic system, in all cultural, political, and other spheres of life. *How was this possible?*

1. **Islam amended the institution of slavery and educated masters about slaves.** 
2. **The Qur'an states many times that everyone is descended from a single ancestor (Adam), and that no one is inherently superior to anyone else because of race, nation, or social standing.** 
3. **The Prophet applied these principles in his own life, and his Companions learned them and accepted them as laws and as social norms.** 

The Prophet stated:

>*""Whoever kills a slave shall be killed. Whoever imprisons and starves a slave will be imprisoned and starved. Whoever castrates a slave will be castrated.""* (  Abu Dawud, Diyat, 70; Tirmidhi, Diyat, 17; al-Nasa'i, Qasama, 10:16.  )

>*""You are sons of Adam, and Adam was created from clay.""* (  Tirmidhi, Tafsir, 49; Manaqib, 73; Abu Dawud, Adab, 111.  )

>*""No Arab is superior to a non-Arab, and no non-Arab is superior to an Arab. No white person is superior to a black person, and no black person is superior to a white person. Superiority is based on righteousness and God-fearing alone.""* (  Ibn Hanbal, Musnad, 411.  )

Because of this compassionate attitude, slaves and those described as poor and lowly were respected by those who enjoyed high social status.

'Umar expressed such respect when he said: 

>*""Master Bilal, whom Master Abu Bakr set free.""* (  Bilal, one of the earliest Muslims, was a black Ethiopian slave. He eventually was chosen by the Prophet to be the official muezzin (caller to prayer) of the Muslim community. Abu Bakr, one of the pre-Islamic Makkan elite and also an early convert, was the Prophet's political successor and the first of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs.

For context, I started experiencing GERD symptoms three years ago. I was prescribed PPIs, and while the symptoms would disappear for a while, they always came back. I’ve had bad episodes where I felt indigestion and had trouble breathing. All this time, I thought it was because of my love for coffee and soda. It wasn’t until a recent endoscopy that I tested positive for H. pylori.

Now I’m on antibiotic treatment and after reading some posts here, I’ve been motivated to cook most of my meals. As someone who loves eating out, I’m kind of saddened by this change. But I can’t help but think that I’ll never really know if the food or drinks in restaurants are clean and uncontaminated. Pain is such a strong “demotivator,” and if cooking my own meals is what it takes to heal and avoid H. pylori again, then I’m willing to do it

I’m curious how those of you recovering from the infection have changed your eating habits after treatment. Have you also been avoiding restaurants and cooking more at home? Are there specific types of food that have helped with healing? I’d really appreciate any tips or advice!",1,1728683653.0,HPylori,0,0.99,False

Struggling with identifying what I'm actually looking for.,"Below is a good example of what I'm struggling with across the board. I'm struggling to identify what I'm actually being asked, and I keep using the wrong formulas at the wrong time.

Question stolen from this video at 10:54(https://youtu.be/Wf0vL6ZLM1A?si=QVxzJBz5GqL-ug44&t=654)

  
In a local donut shop, 63% of customers purchase a donut, 80% of customers purchase coffee, and 88% of customers purchase coffee or a donut. What percentage of customers purchase coffee AND a donut?

P(D) = {purchased donut} = .63

P(C) = {purchased coffee} = .8

P(C OR D) = .88

  
How he solves it: 

P(D OR C) = P(D) + P(C) - P(D AND C)

plug your numbers in and solve.

ok that's fine. But when I tried it before hand I used.

P(C AND D) = P(C) \* P(D)

The first one is right, and my way is wrong.

My thinking was, I'm asked to find P(C AND D). I'm given P(C) and I'm given P(D). So I multiply them together. But using the formula where I'm given two knowns is wrong. And I can't understand why.

Does it have something to do with independence? To me the person buying a coffee has nothing to do with if they're going to buy a donut. So they should be independent events right?

There's something fundamental or simple or both that I'm missing clearly.

If you want to include ships in your solarpunk story (even just mentioned in the background) or you’re looking for references for some artwork, this collection of notes might be able to help. I’m very much not an expert, but I’ve been pestering some of them, and collecting examples from the internet and doing my best to organize it. Hopefully this by-laymen-for-laymen approach will help make it accessible without leading you astray.

One thing to note up front: there’s a ton of variety here. Historical nautical terminology is remarkably chaotic – probably because most of it predates manufacturing practices that involved standardization. Highlights include the fact that ships can be classified based on size, sail plan, rigging, hull type, how they’re used, some combination thereof, or whether they have a figurehead or not. Modern sail-based freight shipping is still very new and I get the impression that the industry as a whole is sort of picking up old ideas and new ones and trying them in different combinations to see what fits. There are very few finished examples underway out in the world and I’m not sure we’ll know what designs are the absolute best for which use cases until a lot more ships have been launched and put to work.

That said, I think we’re definitely going to see a resurgence of sail and it seems like there’s a decent amount of interest and enthusiasm in the industry, even if many are understandably nervous about making huge changes when those changes involve incredibly expensive ships.

# Why sail?

It’s the original zero-carbon (-ish, they deforested huge amounts of land and destroyed entire habitats to build ships back when) shipping and transportation system. We had the technology to move cargo and passengers using the wind to directly do most of the work, and we have the technology (metal hulls, automated rigging, satellite navigation systems, radio, etc) to do it much more safely than our ancestors could. Even if a shipping company isn’t motivated by regulations or pure environmental reasons, oil will get more expensive eventually and that will cut into the profitability of giant motor vessels.

# How shipping might change:

Modern day shipping is extremely cheap but only when you limit the metrics you track to money. When you account for the pollution, the waste, it gets a lot harder to justify. A huge part of keeping modern day cargo shipping cheap is using the absolute worst fuel (bunker fuel, tar-like stuff left over after distilling and cracking petroleum, which is contaminated with everything the fuel they were actually making couldn’t include), as soon as they hit international waters.

I think a solarpunk society is one that cares about externalities. I genuinely like the optimization and logistical advantage of using standardized, stackable shipping containers which fit on ships, trucks, and trains without the need to load and unload the cargoes by hand at each transition in their journey. That’s great stuff, no complaints.

What I wonder about is if the cost efficiency brought by combining containerization with ever-more-massive, bunker-fuel-burning ships has caused other problems. We ship cargo all over the world but much of the time, we do it because it’s so cheap to do so. Many of those containers are full of cheap tat that ends up in landfills after one use or no use at all. We ship raw material from one continent to process it on another, we ship that material to another so it can be shaped into parts, which are shipped away for partial assembly on another continent, and then again for final assembly. Is that efficient? It’s cost efficient. But we burn terrible amounts of fuel each time we do it, and we do it for so many things.

When you read through the handful of real sail ships operating today, a theme becomes somewhat clear – these early (for profit) ones at least are primarily transporting the same high-value or location-specific cargoes sail ships were carrying a hundred years or more ago. Wines, champagnes, and other liquors, raw coffee, raw cocoa, luxury goods like that. This is partly because they need to justify the up-front cost of standing up a whole new kind of shipping, because they’re often slower, and because there are already crew shortages even before getting into the specialized skillsets related to sailing by wind. So they’re currently prioritizing the kind of specialty products (that only grow in certain climates or need special skills or reputation to produce) that exist in one place with markets in others, where they can markup for greener shipping. As they expand, the range of products will no doubt expand as well - cargo ships used to carry all kinds of stuff. But even with massive fleets (to make up for the fact that it’ll be hard to make single ships as big as we have now for reasons I’ll get to) we probably won’t see shipping done as cheap as it is today. Generally I think this lines up well with solarpunk principles like building to your local environment using local materials, manufacturing things locally, and building them to last and to be repairable. Shipping would fit the things that have to come from somewhere else.

# The motor to wind spectrum:

I think it’s safe to say that almost any ship is going to be some kind of hybrid between motor vessel and sailing vessel. What ratio of wind to other energy (electricity, biodesiel, hydrogen, bunker fuel) is up to you. I will say there’s potential for a timeline here, starting with the majority being modern-day cargo ships with sails bolted on saving around 20% of their fuel, and transitioning towards more numerous, smaller ships using more and more wind, until the bulk of the fleet is primarily-sail ships with auxiliary motors or engines for maneuvering in port and dealing with emergencies. And chances are good that ships from all over that spectrum will be sailing at the same time.

# So what does modern-day shipping look like? 

We should cover the current landscape a little so you know what the new stuff is competing with or building on.

Most of the sites I’ve read break cargo ships into a few big categories:

**Container ships:**

These are apparently the most common and probably for good reason. The convenience and efficiency of shipping containers allows for some real benefits. Cargo can be packed into a 20′, 40′ and 45′ long container, transported by truck or train to a port, loaded onto a ship, transported to another continent, lifted onto trains and trucks and not actually unpacked until it reaches its destination. When the alternative is people physically carrying stuff onto the ship and packing it into the hold, and carrying it out and packing it into a truck, you can see where there’d be some advantages. (Palatalized cargo is a sort of great middle ground that allows for better weight distribution in the hold (you want the heaviest stuff near the bottom so the ship is stable) and can be loaded very similarly to how containers are (you move the entire pallet, so it doesn’t get unpacked until it reaches its destination) but that’s not super relevant at the moment.)

The big modern container ships can transport 85 TEUs (twenty equivalent units) to 15,000+ depending on their size. So far the [biggest primarily-sail design](https://www.wind.coop/en/the-sailing-cargo/) I can find can haul 100 TEU containers.

Putting sails on these is kind of difficult because they use the deck for cargo space and will have cranes loading and unloading containers whenever they’re in port. Apparently this isn’t as big an issue as I expected, but it’s still something to keep in mind, especially if there’s tons of rigging involved in the design of the sails.

There’s a ton of designs out there for adding big easy-to-use sails and kites to existing container ships in order to boost their efficiency and cut fuel use somewhat. They’re in use now and have some good info if you’re looking for hard numbers. I haven't really covered them in these notes much.

I find container sailships to be the most interesting (something about the mix of old and new, and the fact that containers make the ship's purpose visually clear) so I’ve got a bunch of examples of them below.

**Roll-on roll-off ships:**

These ships are used to transport wheeled cargo, things like private cars, industrial vehicles, buses, trucks, construction equipment, excavators, etc. They usually have a huge door in the side or stern and the vehicles can directly roll on and off the vessel. They seem to be a popular choice for full-sail cargo ships because they don’t need to worry as much about keeping the decks clear for loading and unloading. How well they’ll fit in a solarpunk world is up to you – some vehicles and wheeled equipment will undoubtedly have to be transported overseas but whether there’ll be enough to justify this class of ship is up to you. Neoline is a good primarily-sail example of this type, Norsepower is a more traditional primarily-fuel version.

**Dry Bulk Carriers:**

These transport solid non-packaged loose dry cargo in bulk quantities. Think wheat/grain, chemicals for fertilizer, cement, wheat, sugar, coal, iron ore etc. Some of the last sail vessels in operation were bulk carriers, like the [Flying P-Liners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_P-Liner), some of which were still transporting nitrates in the 1950s. Most of the modern sailships listed below seem to do at least some of this.

**Tankers:**

These ships transport large amount of liquid cargoes like petroleum products (oil, gas), chemicals, wine, juice, etc. in bulk. They are probably a good fit for a wider range of sail types since they don’t need to worry as much about keeping the decks clear for loading and unloading.

**Reefer ships:**

(Short for refrigerator) they’re designed to transport frozen/temperature-controlled cargoes, mainly in refrigerated containers. Food and perishable goods (fruits, vegetables, meat, fish…). I don’t have much info on these (except that I think a lot of the container examples should apply). I do suspect these would be one of the most challenging as they’ll need a lot of power onboard.

# Considerations for sailing cargo vessels:

This info is mostly pulled from [some excellent comments provided by the folks on the Naval Architecture subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/navalarchitecture/comments/1fvfaj0/a_question_about_modern_sail_ship_designs/). This is a simplified summary, there are definitely details I left out that you can find over there.

**What kind of sails do you need?**

The most obvious (to most of us) difference between motor vessels and sail vessels is the huge masts and sails on top. For cargo vessels, they seem like they should pose huge issues for cranes in the ports (in the case of containerized shipping) but apparently this isn’t as much of an issue with larger and more modern crane designs as I would have expected. The modern cranes lift their booms to allow tall structures past, then lower them to the working position. Apparently they already work right up alongside tall structures on modern cargo ships so masts should be similar.

Where masts pose a problem is with going under bridges. Bridges often block ports and rivers where sail ships would like to enter. Most all of our modern bridge and port infrastructure was built in the days after tall ships had been replaced by steam and motor vessels, but that means there are trillions of dollars worth of port infrastructure that would be blocked to anything with a mast.

This has been a major motivator for folding mast designs. Some sails are better suited to folding masts than others, so consider the routes and ports your ship would likely see, and whether it would need to get past bridges. Consider bridge height, the height of the mast normally associated with your ship height, and whether the mast needs to fold. If it does, consider which sails are well-suited to doing so.

* Several modern/proposed designs like the Windcoop or Neoliner use rigid sails on masts that can apparently fold down.
* Of the more traditional designs, junk rigs / Chinese lug sails / fully battened lug sails seem to be the best candidate for a folding mast and [are apparently pretty easy to use](https://www.kastenmarine.com/junk_rig.htm). Hasler & McLeod for more info. They may use curved battens that flip to orient the curve towards the tack in order to make close-hauled upwind performance comparable to that of a bermuda rig. If you need to understand those terms in order to write your story at the correct level of detail, you probably either know them already or are about to dive in to the world of nautical terminology, in which case best of luck! Lots more info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/navalarchitecture/comments/1fvfaj0/comment/lrcua20/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
* Lateen or “crab claw” varieties fold fine. Unfortunately they don’t sail efficiently enough upwind.
* I’m told a bermuda main sail with in-boom furling is also conceivably compatible with a folding mast but that hasn’t been done yet.

**Water draft/how deep is the ship below the waterline?**

Water draft is another major consideration for port entry. Ports and rivers are shallower than the open ocean and sailing vessels with reasonably good performance will have a deeper draft than an equivalent motor vessel. This is for two reasons that I think basically sum up to ‘preventing the sails from tipping the ship over’ and ‘preventing the wind from pushing the ship sideways’:

* Ballast weight – the lower they can hang the ballast, the lower the vessel’s center of gravity. This makes it more stable against the tendency of the sails to pull it over onto its side.
* The protruding part under the hull acts as a wing in the water, producing horizontal lift. This counteracts the sideways component of the forces generated by the sails when traveling upwind, or even perpendicular to the wind. Having this makes the ship safer by helping prevent it from getting pushed onto shores, rocks, and reefs by unfavorable winds. This extra lateral area is going to stick out way under the hull for hydrodynamic reasons.

To allow them to enter these ports, modern sail ships might use lifting keels or have a flatter bottom, no keel fin, with daggerboards to provide that control while being able to lift up and cross into shallower water.

**How tippy is it?**

Diesel-only ships can make do with a higher center of gravity and much lower angle of vanishing stability (AVS). This is the point at which the vessel will capsize and stay inverted, thus sinking it. That’s because they don’t have sails making it easy for the wind to tip them. Sailing ships tend to lean more while underway, so they can’t pile containers as high.

Containers also don’t allow for the cargo to be packed quite as densely, or apportioned particularly well within the vessel from heavy to light as you go upwards compared to other systems. You just get what you get. Heavier containers can be placed lower, but the overall packaging density is less so the center of gravity still ends up higher than with more piecemeal loading methods. Palletization is a good compromise that can still load a sizable vessel in acceptable time. So while there’s a bunch of interesting container sailboat designs, I think we probably won’t see something equivalent to the absolutely massive cargo ships transporting thousands of containers.

However, this is another place where folding masts can help – being able reef the sails and tip them down during bad weather provides additional stability/safety so the ship can be loaded to a higher center of gravity.

# Examples:

This is a list of new, operating, and proposed sailship designs. I’m going to sort them from less-traditional to more-traditional as determined by me (a person who learned most of this terminology a week ago). There are a lot of traditional sailboat designs seeing a resurgence, with various modernizations ranging from basic stuff like metal hulls, on-board motors, and modern navigation and communication equipment, to fancier stuff like automated sails on rotating masts.

**The** [**Windcoop container ship**](https://www.wind.coop/en/the-sailing-cargo/) - this one has heavily-automated sails with very little rigging, making it easier to load and unload cargo. It can haul 100 TEUs which is the highest number I’ve found so far. It appears to have been designed by the same folks who drew up this one [https://www.dykstra-na.nl/designs/wasp-ecoliner/](https://www.dykstra-na.nl/designs/wasp-ecoliner/) which would have used dynarig sails. At time of writing, neither has been revealed or launched.

[**Neoliner**](https://www.neoline.eu/en/the-neoline-solution/#neoliner) - cosmetically similar to Windcoop (I think, anyways), this is a roll-on roll-off cargo ship with heavily automated sails which can fold down to go under bridges. This has also not launched yet.

**The** [**Anemos**](https://interestingengineering.com/photo-story/worlds-largest-sailing-cargo-ship-anemos), an 81-meter ‘Phoenix’ class ship (I can’t find an equivalent historical type) with a thousand-ton capacity and some automation on the sails. It’s currently transporting cognac, champagne, coffee, and other high-value cargoes.

**The** [**SV Juren AE**](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/this-highly-innovative-sailing-supply-ship-is-a-game-changer-for-the-marshall-islands-238541.html) a 48-meter cargo vessel with an Indosail-Sailing Rig and a 300-ton capacity. It looks much more like modern ships to me, and has an interesting frame rig on the structure near the stern covered in solar panels. A few other ships have used the Indosail rig, including one of Greenpeace’s Rainbow Warrior Ships (I think the one the french didn’t blow up?).

**The** [**Harryproa**](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/65193472eadeb133523da70f/t/65d603737972197f559e6632/1708524406510/Cargo+Proa+Prototype.pdf) (and any other cargo proa designs). These use hull designs borrowed from the outrigger sailing canoes of the Pacific Islands. Made from fiberglass using simple, modular molds, they’re intended to be easy to build and repair. One hull is intended to transport up to 10 tonnes of cargo in modular containers, while the other holds the crew quarters and ferry seating space for 25 passengers. It has a built-in tender (small boat) for reaching areas the main ship can’t, and for powering the main ship when it needs it. This may also be a good candidate for the river boat section below.

It looks somewhat more traditional in the rigging to me. [https://graindesail-overseas.com/grain-de-sail-ii](https://graindesail-overseas.com/grain-de-sail-ii)

[**https://gosailcargo.com/ships.html**](https://gosailcargo.com/ships.html) A list of designs for somewhat traditional (I think) sailboats designed to transport shipping containers, starting with a clipper and working down to small boats. I really appreciate the diagrams they provide with each ship description and feature list. I don’t think any of these have been built yet but they’re based on historical designs. I didn't notice any mention of being able to lower the masts, but some other tall ships, like the USCG training vessel Eagle (a three-masted barque), have upper mast sections that can be lowered to squeeze under modern bridges so that might be an option.

[**The SV Kwai**](https://www.hrmm.org/history-blog/sail-freighter-friday-sv-kwai-2006-present) for an example of a motor vessel retrofitted with fairly traditional sails. This allowed it to visit ports that weren’t considered profitable for motor vessels. A reuse-focused solarpunk society might make a lot of similar retrofits.

[**Sailcargo**](https://www.sailcargo.inc/) – a company operating a small fleet of wood-hulled schooners. They have a fair number of photos to use as references, including some clever solar panel placement.

[**Tres Hombres**](https://fairtransport.eu/en/onze-vloot/tres-hombres/) - about as traditional-looking as it gets – an engineless, wood-hulled brigantine made in the 1940s transporting rum, cocoa, coffee and olive oil.

[**Vega**](https://vega1892.com/historic-vessel-vega-about-the-boat/) - (a looks like either a galleass or a cutter?) built in 1892 and formerly used to transport limestone, bricks, pig iron and cement, it is still in use today, transporting free school and health supplies to remote islands in eastern Indonesia and to East Timor. More info here: [https://www.hrmm.org/history-blog/sail-freighter-friday-galleass-vega-1892-present](https://www.hrmm.org/history-blog/sail-freighter-friday-galleass-vega-1892-present)

This is far from an exhaustive list, if you know of a cool ship or design I should include by all means let me know and I’ll add it!



**River Sailboats** – here’s a few examples (real or proposed) which would operate on large rivers like the Hudson, hauling cargoes or passengers. (Here’s a neat worldbuilding idea I found in the [IWSA Small Windships Publication](https://issuu.com/international_windship_association/docs/iwsa_-_small_vessel_publication) – the term ‘Sail Freight’ is apparently more common in the US while Sail Cargo is more common in Europe – both terms seem to have gained popularity independently, but in the US it was mostly in the context of rivers and coasts while in Europe it seems to be more about ocean cargo. It wouldn’t be unreasonable for sail freight to come to mean transporting cargo on rivers (competing with trucks and trains) while sail cargo ends up referring to the ocean.)

The Eriemax canal barge [https://www.shipshares.com/Eriemax%20Final%20Report.pdf](https://www.shipshares.com/Eriemax%20Final%20Report.pdf)

Like the ships, these smaller watercraft will likely need some kind of motor for tight maneuvering, emergencies, lack of wind, and to work as their primary power in some canals (similar to the old sail-driven [canal barges](https://www.lcmm.org/visit/lois-mcclure/history-of-sailing-canal-schooners/) (sailboats intended to lift dagger boards and drop masts when they get to the canal but able to operate as sailboats outside it). Perhaps these could even operate as [trolly boats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_boat) using overhead wires for power when they get to the canal so they wouldn’t require dense onboard energy storage.

# Other Solarpunk Ship Stuff:

**Other types of vessel**

This post is mostly about cargo but there’s a ton of sail-based passenger stuff out there. I’ve gathered a few examples and will add more as I find new ones:

A company called Star Clipper is operating three tall ship cruise ships, [Star Flyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Flyer), [Star Clipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Clipper), and [Royal Clipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Clipper). These look like older style clipper ships to me so they might actually be using mostly wind. They seem to be very much operating in the cruise ship format, probably with some associated issues, but they demonstrate that passenger liners could still be viable (and can be quite comfortable) if a change in pace of life or available resources reduces the number of airplanes for that kind of travel.

A company called WindStar Cruises also operates a series of cruise-ship-sized ‘motor sailing yachts.’ These have sails but I don’t think these actually rely much on wind, at best I suspect they’re closer to the cargo ships with rotary sails bolted on to save some fuel. One of the naval architects on reddit [seemed to confirm this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/navalarchitecture/comments/1fvfaj0/comment/lrcua20/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

There are also smaller crafts such as the 38-meter [Schooner Mary Day](https://www.sailmainecoast.com/fleet/schooner-mary-day/) which can carry 28 passengers. This may be duplicate with the schooner example from the Hudson above, but it still represents the potential for sail-based water buses on both rivers and coasts.

River and harbour cleanup boats like [Mr. Trash Wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Trash_Wheel) (even if you hope a more solarpunk society would have less plastic trash, storms and floods can wash all kinds of non-trash stuff into the rivers).

There’s also the scaled-up version of those ([though stopping plastic in the rivers appear to still be the critical part](https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2023-03-17/ocean-cleanup-plastic-pollution-great-pacific-garbage-patch/102075810))



**Magazines and publications with lots of good info:**

**The** [**IWSA Small Windships Publication**](https://issuu.com/international_windship_association/docs/iwsa_-_small_vessel_publication) has tons of info on the sub-500GT range of smaller vessels including more info on most of the ships from the examples section (so it would have been really convenient if that was the first thing I found!). You can get a downloadable version [here](https://www.gosailcargo.com/pdf/IWSA-Small-Vessel-Publication-2024.pdf). Developments of Note lists a bunch of goo ships starting on page 10 and Sources for Vessel Plans on page 71 are especially useful but it’s all cool stuff.

**Whale Safety**

Whales are sometimes hit by ships (they sleep just below the surface and don’t know where human shipping lanes are). Some hulls are more dangerous to them than others. Ships with steep, sharp prows and [bulbous bows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulbous_bow) are especially dangerous for whales. If you search for ship hulls and whale safety, you’ll find an unfortunate number of photographs of dead whales draped over those bulbs.

One suggestion is to follow some cargo ferry designs and design the prow of the ship so it’s more traditional, angled forward so the deck is further forward than where the hull meets the waterline, with no bulb below the surface, and a much more rounded/blunt bowstem. This design will likely lose some performance benefits while underway but if it hits a whale I guess it’s more likely to sort of dunk them rather than to slam into them like an axe.

There are also ongoing attempts to map our whale activity and to ensure that human crews are both aware of their presence and actually making efforts to avoid them, but if you’re looking for visuals this might be worth considering.

**Lists of current projects:**

[This event](https://www.windforgoods.fr/en/page/exhibitors) has a decent list of current modern sail ships, from basically-modern-cargo-ships-with-sails-bolted-on to completely modernized 90-100% wind driven ships, to largely historical designs still in use.

I asked for a lower dose because I'm terrified of taking anything because I don't want to become dependent or make my anxiety worse, I also dont take any other medications and tend to try not to.
A little back story- I just turned 35 three weeks ago and I didn't start experiencing really bad anxiety until around new years of 2023 into 2024, I've done my best to manage my symptoms and some days were unbearable, then I had like 6 good months and out of no where it came back last week with a vengeance. The dread about anything and everything, the weight on my chest, hard time breathing and swallowing,  jittery, headache, nervous bowels, hard time falling asleep, uninterested in everything, emotions and feelings were intensified so I went to my doctor and they suggested Hydroxyzine, I was actually afraid to take it but I read a bunch of Reddit threads and that helped, quitting caffeine also helped but sucks because I love my morning coffee. I waited until I felt an anxiety attack coming on and took half (5mg) and the anxiety felt like it got worse for awhile but that might of been me hyping it up, it's hard to get out of your head when your afraid of it getting worse. It took about 40 minutes to kick in and I started feeling heavy headed and the anxiety was like still there on edge but lessoned, like an internal battle was happening, my husband suggested taking the other half so I did take it 1.5 hours after the first so im up to 10mg, now its been another 1.5 hours since taking the full 10mg and the anxiety is gone but I feel drowsy and kind of foggy headed, my appetite feels normal, still have a headache, and still not emotionally back to normal, I just feel weird, its hard to describe. Does this medication eventually level out? My doctor said it'd be fine to take as needed but is it better to get ahead of the attacks?

I have a very intense job in tech , and doing software development for the industry isn’t appealing anymore. I’ve lost that drive .. 

Now, I have a family and I can’t let them down and I picked this profession and I need to provide for them. 

I was thinking on just go to my doctor and maybe suggest trying the alternative even though I’m not so sure if is the best. I was wondering maybe just doing this treatment for some time and make sure I finish my mortgage then switch to something less intense. 

That brings me to formulate the questions. 
Is there permanent problems I’ll have after I quit taking this treatment? 
Can I take breaks on the weekend?

Today I used it for the first time in Sacramento (SMF) and LA (LAX).

The Sacramento lounge was an Escapes Lounge, which was decent I saw quite a bit of foot traffic while I was watching from outside, when I finally went in it feels kinda like a hotel lobby at breakfast somewhat but it was fine. Quieter than the general area and the coffee was decent, I didn't check out the food really so that's still on the list.

My main reason for posting though was the LAX lounge I went to ""gameway"" in terminal 3 where I had a lot of fun. It's a gaming Cafe pretty much so not many food options other than nuts/chips and water / sodas but it was very fun to play CoD on Xbox while waiting for my flight which ended up severely delayed.

The gaming setup wasn't stellar mostly because the tvs were slow but but they had headsets and upgraded controllers.

Point of the story it was fun & if you're a gamer you'd probably like being able to play console waiting for your flight. It was almost too much fun because I didn't want to leave, but i had a FLIGHT. You know how it is.

	“I’ll be home at 4:15, i have to drop something off at Lexi’s house,” i give you a look, you never spent time after school, maybe you had made a friend, but i doubt it, you’ve never talked about this ‘Lexi’ before… 
	“Okay, be safe.”
	“Yeah yeah, whatever,” you state, pulling your bag over your shoulder, leaving me alone, to make pancakes and set away your cup. I hope Max will be okay, please… Be okay… But I doubt it, they never are, they’ve been skipping school, coming home and sleeping all day, like their body was exhausted. I wish you loved yourself… But you don’t and you’ve said that many times, ‘no one loves me so why should i love myself?’ But I love you, and I would do anything to keep you safe, but you don’t want to. You don’t care about safety. Sometimes I wish I could make you see my love, make you smile, I've not ever seen you smile… I’ve only known you for a few weeks, but you made me sad, rotting away in your bed, as you say everything is fine. Is everything fine? No… And I don't know when it will be, because I'm failing at saving you. I’m not good enough for you. And I never will be.

1g1kr65,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1g1kr65/new_field_for_better_pay_or_keep_my_job_with_a/,"New field for better pay, or keep my job with a great environment?","I am 21, and have worked in preschools and education for 5 years now. Last year I signed onto a salary with an elementary school for 31,719 a year. The environment is great, we only operate 4 days a week, my coworkers and supervisors both are friendly and understanding, and I can get away with sitting down and doing nothing for about an hour everyday without anyone climbing up my ass. 

I've been feeling a bit trapped in childcare recently, and really broke, so I was searching for a new job. My friend recommended their company to me, things went through, and now I've got a 25/hour offer sitting in my email. An expected 40/48 hours a week, vs my current 32. 

It's boiled down to 31,719 for a good job that pays bad, or 48,00/55,000 for a bad job that pays good.

My financial situation is YEARNING for a new job. After taxes, each paycheck is almost 1k even.  I use one paycheck in its entirety to pay rent, and my other is spent on bills, insurances, pets, gas, and medication almost instantly. I consider myself lucky if I have 100 a month for groceries.  I regularly dip 100-200 into the negatives in my bank account, at least once or twice a month. I'm so tired of living in constant broke anxiety.  I want to save up for a motorcycle, which I've aspired to do since I was 5. I never have enough to even think about a savings account. 

I've even started daydreaming of actually having money to get coffee in the morning. I try not to prioritize work, but it often ends up influencing my day regardless. I'm not sure if that's the stress of working with kids,  or just who I am as a person. I've never worked in another field before, and the New Job knows this and would be willing to train me. I feel guilty, like I'm 'betraying' my supervisors and coworkers by taking a new job. Especially as I currently hold 3 roles, and they would need to fill the 2 essential roles every school requires when I leave, which is unfortunately only a weeks notice. 

I told my boss, and she didn't give a number but asked me what it would take to stay. I floundered and said 42,000. She hasn't replied, though I did only send it a half hour ago. I still don't know how to sort this in a logical way. Feeling like im """"""betraying"""""" The company and leaving them in a really rough spot is influencing me, but I KNOW that they're not really a friend, and would probably drop me in an instant if they had someone to replace me. Just feeling unsure of how to go about this and could use some advice from those more experienced in the world of jobs and careers and negotiating and job hopping.

The tasting room. 

Edward Stillwell glanced at the envelope resting on his polished mahogany desk. The glint of gold lettering caught the light, pulling his attention away from the stack of reviews waiting for his keen eye. With a flick of his fingers, he opened the invitation, and the paper crinkled under his grip. He furrowed his brow as he read the elegant script:

You are cordially invited to experience an evening of culinary wonder at La Chambre du Goût. Nothing but the rarest of rare meats awaits you. 


He dropped the invitation onto the desk, his lips curling into a skeptical smile. “Rare meats,” he muttered, shaking his head. The phrase echoed mockingly in his mind, stirring a sense of curiosity mixed with disdain. 


Edward Stillwell cut a striking figure, tall and lean, with a meticulously tailored charcoal suit that hugged his angular frame. His sleek gray hair, neatly combed back, framed a face marked by sharp cheekbones and a well-defined jawline. He often wore a look of intense concentration, his piercing blue eyes scanning his surroundings with the precision of a hawk. But it was his peculiar mannerism that set him apart: when deep in thought, he had a habit of tapping his fingers rhythmically against his chin, as if conducting an invisible orchestra of ideas, his brow slightly furrowed.  


He leaned back in his leather chair, fingers tapping rhythmically against the armrest. What could possibly remain uncharted in the culinary world? He pictured the countless meats he had tasted, from the gamey flesh of venison to the exotic richness of alligator.


His phone rang, pulling him from his thoughts. “Gerald,” he answered, adjusting his tie and straightening his posture.

“Edward, did you get the invitation?” Gerald’s voice crackled over the line. “You simply must attend. They say Marius Bellefeuille is a culinary genius!”

Edward scoffed, rolling his eyes. “Or a charlatan with a flair for the dramatic. I’ve tasted everything under the sun; what can this chef possibly offer?”

“Exactly that! Something you’ve never tasted before. Don’t be a bore, Edward. You can’t resist an adventure.”

Edward sighed, feeling the familiar tug of his competitive spirit. “Very well, I’ll go. But if it’s just another gimmick…” He left the sentence hanging, letting the threat linger.

After hanging up, he stared at the invitation once more, feeling the pull of intrigue deepening. He found himself contemplating the restaurant’s location, tucked away in an unmarked building down a narrow alley. How odd, he thought. He found a thrill in secrecy, something he couldn’t ignore.

As twilight draped the city, Edward navigated through the winding streets. The cobblestones, worn smooth by countless footsteps, echoed with the rhythmic clatter of horse-drawn carriages mingling with the hum of distant conversations. Soft lamplight flickered against wrought-iron balconies adorned with trailing vines, casting playful shadows on the sidewalk. The air carried a medley of scents—freshly baked bread wafting from a nearby boulangerie, mingling with the rich aroma of brewing coffee and the faint, sweet fragrance of blooming jasmine from window boxes. Occasional bursts of laughter erupted from outdoor cafés, punctuated by the soft clinking of glasses. 

As Edward approached the restaurant, La Chambre du Goût, the façade loomed before him, dark and foreboding, its windows obscured by thick, velvet drapes.  A narrow alley framed the entrance, lined with flickering gas lamps that struggled to illuminate the gloom. 

Edward stood before the heavy doors of La Chambre du Goût, the weight of his anticipation pressing against his chest. He pushed them open, and the creak of aged wood echoed in the silence. 

The air inside felt thick, heavy with the aroma of simmering spices. Dimly lit chandeliers hung from the ceiling, their golden hues casting long shadows that danced across the polished wooden floor. A few elegantly set tables dotted the room, each adorned with crisp white linens and flickering candles that barely illuminated the stark surroundings.

As Edward stepped inside, the atmosphere shifted. 

“Welcome to La Chambre du Goût, Mr. Stillwell,” a piercing nasal voice said from behind him, 

Edward turned to find a tall man in a white chef’s coat, a wiry silhouette with dark eyes that sparkled with an unsettling intensity.

“I am Marius Bellefeuille.”  he said, shaking Edward’s hand. Edward recoiled at how greasy and cold his palm was. “We are honored to finally have such a renowned food critic like you here, Edward.” He straightened and gave a big smile. His teeth were yellow. “Tonight, you shall embark on a culinary journey like no other.”

Edward offered a tight smile, but the warmth didn’t reach his eyes. He forced himself to meet Marius’s gaze, feeling a flicker of unease. “Let’s hope your menu lives up to the hype.”

Marius chuckled, the sound low and resonant. “Oh, I assure you, it will be a night to remember.”

As Marius gestured toward a table in the corner, Edward followed, scanning the room. The absence of other diners nagged at him. The restaurant felt like a stage set for an unplayed performance, and he was the lone actor, under the scrutiny of an unseen audience.

“Tonight’s menu features some of the rarest meats you’ll ever encounter,” Marius continued, his voice laced with a hint of pride. “Each dish is crafted to evoke a journey through flavor and sensation.”


“This place has quite the reputation.” Edward said as Marius pulled out the chair for him, his eyes lingering a moment too long as Edward sat down. 

The moment he settled into the chair, the flicker of candlelight danced across the table, casting fleeting shadows on his face.

 
“Reputation is merely a reflection of the experience one provides, wouldn’t you agree?”  Marius leaned in, tilted his head, and peered into Edward’s eyes. His fingers danced on the table, tracing invisible patterns, “Tonight, I promise you a taste of the extraordinary.”

Edward nodded, glancing around the dining room. The quiet buzz of the city outside faded away, leaving only the low murmur of Marius’s voice and the occasional clink of silverware. He wasn’t sure where it came from since he was the only one there. 


Edward picked up the wine list, his brow furrowing as he scanned the selections. “You seem confident,” he remarked, trying to sound intrigued. 

Marius leaned back slightly, crossing his arms, an enigmatic smile playing at the corners of his mouth. “Confidence is key in my profession. But it’s the ingredients that truly matter.”

As Marius began to pour the first glass of deep red wine, Edward’s senses sharpened. He caught a glimpse of movement from the kitchen, shadows flitting behind the frosted glass door, but the moment passed too quickly for him to focus on any details.

“Let’s begin,” Marius said, placing the glass in front of Edward. “I recommend savoring each course. The flavors will unfold in ways you never imagined.”

Edward raised his glass, the rich aroma wafting up to greet him. But as he took the first sip, Marius watched him intently. 

“Tell me, Mr. Stillwell,” Marius leaned closer, lowering his voice, “what does it take for you to be truly impressed?”

Edward set the glass down, feeling the weight of Marius’s gaze. “I’ll know it when I taste it,” 

“Ah,” Marius murmured, his smile widening, “then let the journey begin.”


The flickering candlelight danced across the elegant dining table, illuminating the polished silverware and crystal glassware that glimmered like jewels. Edward sat poised, anticipation buzzing in the air as Marius placed the first course before him—a carpaccio, glistening under the soft glow.

Marius stepped back, a knowing smile curling his lips as he watched Edward. The thinly sliced meat lay artfully arranged, a deep crimson hue adorned with sprigs of fresh herbs and drizzles of olive oil. Edward leaned forward, the aroma enveloping him, rich and intoxicating, yet something unfamiliar lurked beneath.

With a steady hand, he picked up his fork and pierced the delicate slice. He brought it to his mouth, the coolness of the meat meeting his tongue. The flavors burst forth—earthy, sweet, and somehow alive. His eyes widened, and he chewed slowly, trying to pinpoint the taste that danced on the edge of recognition.

“This is unlike anything I’ve tasted,” Edward finally exclaimed, setting his fork down with a soft clink. He glanced up at Marius, searching for answers. “What exactly is this meat?”

Marius leaned in, tilting his head slightly, his fingers danced on the edge of the table as he savored Edward’s intrigue. “Ah, the first of many surprises,” he replied, his voice smooth and enticing. “It is from an animal that most have only heard of in whispers.”

Edward frowned, a flicker of unease tightening his chest. “Whispers? What do you mean? Is this some rare breed?”

Marius chuckled, his gaze unwavering, and the candlelight cast shadows across his face, deepening the contours. “In a manner of speaking. You might say this animal is as elusive as it is exquisite.”

“I’m not sure I follow. What’s the name of this creature?”

Marius straightened, a satisfied gleam in his eye. “Names can be deceiving. It’s best to let the flavors speak for themselves.”

Edward leaned back and took another bite. The taste lingered, hauntingly complex, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was being drawn deeper into something unsettling.


Marius cleared the first course, replacing it with a steaming dish. The rich scent of herbs and spices wafted up, swirling through the air as Edward’s fork sank into the next creation. He raised a tender morsel to his mouth, but the flavors sparked a flicker of discomfort.

“Interesting,” Edward said, forcing the words out as he chewed. He met Marius’s gaze. “You’ve piqued my curiosity. Where do these ‘rare’ animals come from?”

Marius leaned back, fingers gliding along the table’s edge, his calm demeanor never wavering. “All in good time, my friend. Enjoy the journey before you ruin the surprise!”

Edward clenched his jaw, irritation bubbling beneath his composure. “I’m serious. I want to know what I’m eating.”

Marius chuckled, the sound low and almost melodic. “Trust the experience. It will all unfold.”

As Edward pressed for answers, a piercing scream erupted from the kitchen. The sound sliced through the air, jolting him in his seat. He glanced toward the frosted glass door, heart racing, but Marius remained unfazed.

“What was that?” Edward demanded, his voice rising. “What is happening back there?”

Marius waved a dismissive hand, his smile unwavering. “Just a little kitchen drama. Nothing to concern yourself with. Focus on your meal.”

Edward’s pulse quickened, and he leaned closer, challenging Marius’s calm. “This isn’t a joke. I need to know where this meat comes from.”

Marius tilted his head, eyes narrowing slightly. “Fear not, Edward. You will learn all in due time. The flavors will guide you.”

Another shout pierced the air, more desperate this time. Edward’s stomach churned, and he dropped his fork. “What is going on? Tell me!”

Marius chuckled softly, amusement dancing in his eyes. “It’s all part of the experience. Relax and savor the moment.”

Edward recoiled, dread creeping in as he fought the urge to bolt. The tension in the room thickened, pressing against him like a weight, while Marius’s gaze remained steady, revealing nothing.



Marius whisked away the empty plate and returned with a bowl, steam rising in swirling tendrils. He placed it before Edward, the aroma wafting upward, almost intoxicating. Edward grasped his spoon, but his fingers trembled, a chill creeping through him as he stared at the dark stew, chunks of meat submerged within.

He scooped a bite, lifting it to his lips. The stew’s initial warmth spread across his tongue, rich and velvety, but there was something unsettling about its sweetness. It wasn’t the familiar, comforting sweetness of caramelized onions or roasted root vegetables—it clung to his palate like syrup, coating his mouth in an almost sticky way. Beneath that, a metallic aftertaste lingered, sharp and raw, as if the meat had bled into the broth.

Each bite felt heavier, as though the stew was forcing itself down, refusing to settle. The meat, though tender, had a texture that didn’t quite match anything Edward had encountered before—too smooth, too pliable.. The unsettling sweetness mingled with an earthy undertone that made his stomach churn.

The discomfort came from the way the flavors conflicted—sweetness battling with something darker, something that tasted too close to life, to blood. It wasn’t the familiar gamey flavor of venison or the rich, fatty taste of beef. It was something he couldn’t place, and it gnawed at him. 

“This stew—there’s a sweetness to it. It’s unsettling,” he stammered, setting the spoon down with a deliberate motion. “Are you sure this is safe to eat?”

Marius leaned closer, his breath brushing against Edward’s ear. “ Ah, but isn’t the thrill of culinary exploration worth the risk?”

Edward recoiled instinctively, a shiver darting down his spine. He straightened, trying to assert himself, yet the flickering candlelight made him feel exposed. “I appreciate adventure, but I need to know what I’m eating,” 

Marius straightened, fingers drumming lightly on the table. “You see, Edward, I’ve always had a passion for exotic meats. Each one carries a unique history, a story waiting to unfold on the plate. The flavors, the textures—they resonate with the soul of their origin.”

Edward’s grip on the spoon tightened, knuckles whitening as he forced himself to take another bite. He chewed slowly, his jaw tense, unease twisting in his stomach. “This meat—where does it come from?”

Marius’s eyes sparkled with enthusiasm, yet Edward felt his heart race with unease. “Imagine traveling to remote locations, seeking out creatures that most only dream of tasting. I live for that journey, for the chance to transform something rare into a culinary masterpiece.”

Edward’s breath quickened, and he leaned back slightly, the chair creaking under him. “But what are these creatures? What am I actually eating?” His voice rose, betraying the tension coursing through him.

Marius chuckled softly, the sound both inviting and menacing. “Every great dish hides its secrets. You must understand the art of it. Some flavors are simply more thrilling than others, more… daring.”

Another echoing shout from the kitchen punctuated Marius’s words, causing Edward to flinch and jump in his seat, his pulse racing. 

“ What’s happening in there ? “ he shouted as he pushed back his chair abruptly, legs scraping against the floor as he rose. His heart pounded as he turned toward the kitchen, the scream still ringing in his ears. “That scream… I can’t just sit here. What’s really going on back there?”

He took a step, but Marius moved swiftly, blocking his path with a hand on Edward’s shoulder. The pressure of his grip was firm, almost too firm.

“I wouldn’t recommend that, my friend,” Marius said softly, his breath warm, tinged with the unsettling scent of iron and spice. His eyes locked onto Edward’s, a thin smile forming on his lips. “The kitchen is no place for a guest. Let them handle their… passions.”

Marius’s hand slid from Edward’s shoulder to the small of his back, guiding him with smooth, deliberate pressure. “Come now,” he murmured, his voice low and calm, “there’s no need for alarm. Let’s not interrupt the artistry behind your meal.”

Edward hesitated, eyes darting to the kitchen door, but Marius steered him gently yet insistently back toward the table. The flickering candlelight cast their shadows long and warped across the room, and Edward felt a cold sweat prickling his neck as his legs moved without his full consent. Marius’s grip remained steady, unyielding, his presence looming beside him.

“Sit, Edward,” Marius urged, almost a command now, as he eased Edward back into his chair. “You wouldn’t want to spoil the experience.” The weight of the chair creaked beneath Edward as Marius released him, stepping back with that same thin smile. “Trust me—everything is as it should be.”

Marius waved a dismissive hand, his calm demeanor unshaken. “Just the passion of my chefs. They strive for perfection. Cooking is not just a job; it’s an obsession, an art form. I have dedicated my life to mastering it.”

Edward swallowed hard, feeling the tightness in his throat. He tasted the stew again, the sweetness now cloying, suffocating. 

“My dear Edward, you cannot let fear cloud your senses. Each meal is a journey, and with that journey comes risk. Embrace it, or you will miss the true essence of my cooking.”

Edward set down the spoon, his fingers trembling. He stared at Marius, searching for a glimmer of truth behind the chef’s polished facade.





The final course lay before Edward, a perfectly seared cut of meat resting in a pool of dark sauce. The room had grown unnervingly quiet, the candles flickering in steady rhythm, casting long, distorted shadows across the table. Edward’s hand trembled as he brought the last bite to his lips, his stomach. Each swallow felt more like a stone sinking deeper inside him.

He set the fork down slowly, his breath shallow. Across from him, Marius watched, his hands clasped in front of him, fingers barely twitching, eyes sharp and unwavering.

Edward’s chest tightened, the weight of the evening pressing against him. His mind raced, piecing together fragments—the screams, the evasions, the strange, unplaceable taste of the meat. He couldn’t shake the gnawing thought that he had been deceived, played like a fool.

“Enough games!” His voice cracked with rising panic.“Tell me where this meat comes from, or I will walk out of here!”  His hands were pressing against the edge of the table. 

Marius didn’t flinch. He remained seated, his posture relaxed, fingers still intertwined on the table. A smile played at the edges of his lips as he looked up at Edward, his eyes cold but untroubled.

“You walked in willingly, Edward,” Marius said, his voice calm, almost soothing. “The truth is not so easily digested.”

Edward’s fists clenched, his pulse hammering in his ears. “What are you talking about? What have you been feeding me?”

Marius slowly rose to his feet, his movements smooth, controlled. “You asked for an experience unlike any other. I delivered. Now, whether you can stomach the truth, that’s another matter entirely.”

Edward’s heart raced as Marius stepped closer, his presence suddenly overwhelming, the room shrinking with every word.


The air in the room thickened, the flickering candlelight dimming as if the shadows themselves pressed closer. Marius stood tall, his calm demeanor slipping into something colder, more deliberate. He moved to the side of the table, hands folded behind his back, and looked down at Edward with a gaze that cut deeper than any knife.

“You see, my dear critic,” Marius began, his voice smooth as silk, “you are not just a guest here. You are part of the experience.”

Edward stared at him, his breath shallow, the weight of Marius’s words sinking in. The room felt smaller, the walls pressing in with every second. His chair creaked as he shifted, muscles tensing, ready to spring to his feet.

Marius moved closer, slowly, deliberately, his voice laced with menace. “Stay, and you may yet find enjoyment. Leave…” He paused, the smile that curled his lips devoid of warmth. “Well, let’s not dwell on that.”

Edward shot up from his seat, his voice cracking with disbelief and rising panic. “This is madness! You think you can intimidate me with your theatrics?”

Marius remained unfazed, his eyes gleaming with a cold amusement. He gestured toward the door with a slow sweep of his hand. “You can leave anytime you wish. But I wonder… do you truly want to? You’ve savored what others could only dream of. Do you really want to walk away now, before the final course?”

Edward’s chest tightened, fear creeping through him, yet anger flared, keeping him upright. “You’re insane,”

Marius smiled again, that chilling, knowing smile. “Perhaps. But in this room, at this moment, only one of us holds the key to what happens next. So, my dear Edward…” He leaned in closer, the flicker of candlelight dancing across his face, casting shadows that deepened his grin. “What will it be? Dessert… or something far less pleasant?”


Edward’s pulse hammered in his ears as the horror of Marius’s words sank in. His eyes darted to the door, the faint glow of the hallway taunting him with the slim chance of escape. Without another word, he bolted toward it, his shoes scuffing the floor, breath shallow, hands trembling as he reached for the handle. But Marius was faster—suddenly in front of him, blocking his path, his movements fluid, almost predatory.

“You can’t do this to me!” Edward gasped, his voice thin with panic. “I won’t be a part of this!”

Marius smirked, his hands at his sides, calm, almost amused. “But you already have,” he said, his voice like a smooth, icy whisper. He leaned in slightly, his eyes locking onto Edward’s. “A critic is only as good as his taste, after all. You will be my finest dish.”

Edward stumbled back, his heart racing as the words echoed in his mind. He glanced around frantically, looking for another way out, but the walls seemed to close in on him, the flickering candlelight distorting everything. He turned back to Marius, but the chef stood still, his smirk deepening.

Edward felt the room tilt. “No—this isn’t real,” he muttered, backing up against the wall. “This can’t be happening…”

But Marius only stepped forward. “It’s already begun.”






Edward woke up in a small dimly lit room. The floor was cold against his body. His breath came in shallow gasps, his eyes darting around the space. A single flickering light bulb hung from the ceiling, casting erratic shadows across the bare walls. His heart thundered in his chest, each beat a reminder of the trap he’d walked into. He stumbled to the door, pushing against it, but it wouldn’t budge. He was locked in.

“This can’t be happening,” Edward whispered, sliding down to the floor. His hands gripped his hair, pulling at it. “I— I’m a food critic, not a meal!”

From behind the door, Marius’s voice carried through. “Remember, Edward, every dish tells a story. Yours is just about to be served.”

Edward’s breath hitched. He could feel the walls closing in, the weight of his arrogance suffocating him. How many times had he walked into restaurants with a sense of superiority, dissecting dishes, belittling chefs who poured their souls into their work? Now, here he was—reduced to nothing more than an ingredient in Marius’s twisted masterpiece.

He pressed his back against the door, trembling, the irony suffocating him. He had always prided himself on knowing the finest meals, tasting the rarest flavors. But this… this was the rarest flavor of all, and he was part of it.



The next day, the dining room was bathed in warm, inviting light as the next wave of diners filed in, their conversations light and buzzing with anticipation. The tables gleamed under the soft glow of the chandeliers, the flicker of candles reflecting off the pristine silverware. Each guest looked around with curiosity, marveling at the exclusivity of the experience.

Marius stood at the center of the room, hands outstretched, his smile wide and welcoming. His eyes glittered as he surveyed the new faces, a fresh crop of eager participants ready to be swept into his web.

“Welcome, everyone!” he announced, his voice full of charm and promise. “Tonight, we delve into the extraordinary. Who among you is ready for the rarest flavors life has to offer?”

The diners chuckled, exchanging excited glances, unaware of the horror that had transpired just hours before. Plates clinked, glasses were raised, and Marius’s smile never faltered. As he moved toward the kitchen, he cast one final glance at the dining room, satisfied.

The cycle had begun again.

So I realize there might be a deeper issue here, but I just want to get some opinions on the latest example which just happened. I also realize this example will sound extremely insignificant, but it's just one of many lately so I think that's why I'm ""overthinking"" it. This was all communicated via text.

My gf works remotely and is often at various coffee shops. Last week she told me she got hit on by a barista at one of her favorite coffee shops, I'll call it X. He gave her his number on a napkin. And that she now feels awkward to go back since she didn't text him back. Totally fair. I get it.

Today she told me she was picking something up from her friends house which is just a couple blocks away from X. Then she said she was headed to work, so I asked ""Which shop are you going to? X?"" Her reply was an eye-roll emoji followed by ""And say what to the guy? I told you before I probably wont be back there for a while"" And she never told me which shop she was going to.

I asked if she was annoyed at my question and she said that the eye roll was a joke, that I was reading too much into her reply and then said ""sorry for not including more emojis and lols in my replies"" which I thought was a bit sarcastic. I don't think that I'd expect a bunch of emojis and lols in order to not feel like she was annoyed, but the eye roll emoji, followed by the reply, and the lack of telling me where she actually went made me feel like she was annoyed. I think a truly neutral response would be something like ""Didn't go to X bc I still feel awk about that guy. I'm going to Y instead""

Again, I realize this is so stupid in the grand scheme of things. But we've been dealing with many of these little kinds of cases, some more significant than others, so it's been piling up for me. Appreciate any opinions.",2,1728682470.0,amiwrong,1,1.0,False

Yet depression, Bipolar 2, and ADHD plus certain living situations have conspired to make my life a living hell for me.

My only living parent lives with me.  She’s nowhere near handicapped yet it’s like she’s a toddler.  I am forever cleaning up after her and she’s always leaving ‘her stuff’ out.  I don’t feel like it’s even my house anymore.

Nothing stays where I put it.  I have no joy in my life, save my kids and husband.  And dogs.

I don’t work.  I’m basically a maid.  All I do is clean, do laundry, pick things up, take care of the dogs.  And drive mom where she needs to go.  Plus my mil needs help as well.

I don’t really have friends, just 2.  I don’t meet anyone for coffee or for lunch.  We don’t have friends over.  

I can’t just up and do anything/go anywhere without ALWAYS taking others’ considerations before my own.  Someone has to watch the dogs.  Someone has to be here in case one of the parents falls and needs help.  I don’t have anything I do for fun.  If you told me I could do anything I want for a day, I would just sleep.  That’s all I do most days anyway.

I am medicated for my issues.  Yet I just don’t care anymore.  My kids are grown, the youngest is graduating college in the spring.  No one really needs me.  Hubby could hire a housekeeper and it would be fine, if not better in the house.

I just don’t want to be me anymore.  It seems my hate for my life feels stronger than the love for my family.  And that does not bode well for me at all.

I (34M) work with (25F). The mixed work-friend group we have among the few of us is relatively homogenous. Any number of us could be seen having coffee or eating together at the nearby fast food stand during breaks or hanging out in each other’s offices when those of us who are professors don’t have classes. Some of even go for drinks after work, from time to time. I forgot to mention that we work at a high school, she as a school psychologist and I as a teacher. 

During one of those office breaks the two of us talked and the conversation was really fun and lighthearted. I got a few laughs and was generally pleased with meeting her. I wouldn’t call it falling in love, but I feel some of you would at least understand the concept of a work-crush. In any case, I wasn’t and still am not looking for a relationship, but being an introvert I get a certain feeling when I click with someone, since it doesn’t happen very often lately, so I want to play it out, be it a relationship of just friendship. It’s hard to explain. 

We already had drinks at the aforementioned fast food stand with 2 more friends, but I was in a kind of a funk. I did my usual routine but was somewhat limited because the humour we usually do when more of us are together is a bit darker so I didn’t want to open with that level. During the 2-3 times I talked with her in the office I felt more at home and the exchange was smoother.

Since 99% of the students are boys, wanting to avoid certain comments from them but still wanting to continue the conversations 1 on 1 with her (she shares an office a another female colleague so there wasn’t much privacy, except when the colleague would leave for a short time), I asked her if she would like to have coffee sometime after work. Now, here is where I messed up. Whether it be because I asked her while a few more people were just entering the office or because, after she said she was busy that day I immediately said we can circle back to another day next time or both, she was flattered but said she doesn’t mix her work life with her private life. I know this wasn’t 100% true because my friend (32M) said he had coffee with her once outside the school, about 2-3 weeks earlier. Before any of you assume, he’s getting married tomorrow so it was just a friendly coffee. 
It could be that I gave off the vibe of wanting to flirt but making it too obvious too soon or something like that, I’m not sure. In any case, I responded with “Of course, I understand” smiled and left. 

Since classes started not long after, I decided to take advantage of that by keeping my distance, just saying hi, pretending I’m busier than I actually am and in general just seeing to it that our paths cross as less often as possible without making it obvious that I’m doing it. I know this might come across as passive aggressive, but so would continuing to come to their office might make it seem that I’m still hoping she’d change her mind. I was hoping to avoid the latter.

A few days ago, her colleague (asked me if I was still in the building. I said that I was already home (which I was) and asked if it’s regarding something important. She told me that 25F needed something. What she needed was to talk to me about a filing issue which has already been resolved the week prior plus her colleague could’ve asked me about it herself since I talk to her more often about these things. The next day, 25F asked me about it in the hallway. I answered quickly because I really was in a hurry, having to make photocopies before class and started walking away, but she followed me for a few steps asking how I’ve been doing, obviously wanting to make small talk. I can’t remember what I said afterwards, I know we were talking about some seminar she had to attend or something, but she laughed while slightly leaning against the wall. Might be nothing, but I’ve never gotten that reaction before. As I’ve said at the beginning, this might be overthinking, but so much is said about guys missing signals that I feel I should mention it. Afterwards we had a few laughs regarding the topic of the seminar in the staff room and she even asked me when my shift ends. It turned out I was done before her but I added how I was even busy afterwards (which really was true, I had a family thing to take care of).

The next day we had a few work-related exchanges and later, when we talked more casually before quitting time in the main hallway, she mentioned how some students found a picture of a girl they think its her but it clearly isn’t and how I’d find itnteresting. She couldn’t find it then and there but said she’d show it to me when she does (we both had to go in a few minutes).

I’d be perfectly fine if the previous rejection was it, but somehow I get the feeling that she reinitiated our conversations after me keeping my respectful and colleague-like distance. Should I ask her out on a drink again and when? Also, for those who are wondering how I think a relationship or at least a hookup, if it occured would function since we’re colleagues: she’s on a 1-year contract because she’s a trainee, so she’d be leaving the school by summer anyway.

1g1kets,https://www.reddit.com/r/BGodInspired/comments/1g1kets/faith_in_action_empowering_lives_through/,Faith in Action: Empowering Lives Through Generosity,"https://bgodinspired.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1728680969.png

**Devotional: Faith in Action – Empowering Lives Through Generosity**

**Scripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 9:6-8 (NIV)**

“Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously. Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.”

**Reflection:**

As we navigate our daily lives, the call to live out our faith can often feel overwhelming. Yet, the beautiful truth is that living out our faith can be a journey rooted in simplicity: generosity. In this scripture from 2 Corinthians, we are reminded that our attitude towards giving has immense power—not just for our hearts, but for the lives of those around us.

Generosity, in its essence, is an act of faith. It signifies our trust in God’s provision. When we give freely, we declare that we believe God is more than able to meet our needs, and we create a ripple effect of hope and empowerment in our communities. Each act of kindness, no matter how small, contributes to a larger tapestry of love and support.

**Understanding Generosity:**

1. **Generosity Transcends Resources**: Many often equate generosity only with financial contributions. While giving money is vital, generosity can take many forms—time, skills, empathy, and encouragement. When we invest in others with our presence and abilities, we make a profound impact. Consider volunteering at a local shelter, mentoring someone in your field, or simply sharing a meal with a neighbor. Each act connects us and embodies the love of Christ.
2. **Empowerment through Giving**: When we choose to give, we are not merely acting from duty; we are participating in God’s mission to empower others. Our gifts can uplift those who are struggling, providing them with hope, dignity, and the resources they need to move forward. Imagine the transformation that can occur when one person recognizes their worth through our kindness!
3. **The Joy of a Cheerful Heart**: God loves a cheerful giver because giving should stem from joy—not obligation. As we practice generosity, it transforms us, fostering a heart aligned with the spirit of Christ. Each time we give, we create space in our hearts for love, gratitude, and mindfulness of others’ needs.

**Encouragement:**

In this season of life, let us challenge ourselves to embrace the call of faith in action through generosity. Here are some practical ways to empower lives:

- **Set a Giving Goal**: Decide on a percentage of your income, time, or resources that you can commit to giving this month. This could be through local charities, ministries, or community outreach programs.
- **Share Your Talents**: Are you good at baking, tutoring, or organizing? Consider how your unique gifts can serve and uplift those around you. Offer to host a workshop, help someone with their resume, or start a community project.
- **Be Present**: Sometimes, the most generous thing we can give is our time. Make an effort to check in on friends or neighbors. A simple call or a shared coffee can lift someone’s spirit and make them feel valued.
- **Practice Gratitude**: Each morning, reflect on what you are thankful for and how you can pass that blessing on to others. Gratitude cultivates a generous spirit and opens our eyes to the needs around us.

Generosity is a powerful expression of faith in action that empowers lives—ours included. As we sow seeds generously, may we reap an abundant harvest of love, hope, and transformation in ourselves and others.

**Closing Prayer:**

Gracious Lord, thank You for the many blessings You have bestowed upon us. Help us to recognize that our gifts, big or small, can make a significant difference in the lives of others. Open our hearts to generous living, allowing our faith to shine through our actions. Empower us to be conduits of Your love and blessings in this world. In Jesus’ name, we pray. Amen.

1g1kcuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manipulation/comments/1g1kcuz/do_these_red_flags_resonate_with_you_if_yes/,"Do these red flags resonate with you? If yes, please walk away. Here are examples that you’re not “over reacting” and that how they’re treating you is not normal. Emotional abuse is covert and not just limited to name calling, expletives, yelling or insults. ","I stayed too long, and should’ve left much sooner than I did. I’m processing things in therapy and now that I’m looking back on everything, I realize how ridiculous these situations are and yes, I need to work on my boundaries, listen to my intuition and walk away when these flags come up in the next person. Never again will I make excuses for someone who devalues and disrespects me, gaslights me, or makes me question my worth. 

My ex gaslight me, used DARVO in conflict, could never take accountability/blamed me for his actions, lied constantly by omitting information & convinced me that I was the problem to the point where I was spending $150 every two weeks to see a therapist…while he was cheating on me throughout our entire relationship. The time apart has made me realize just how unacceptable his actions were. 

Red flags didn’t start until 4 months into the relationship, after he had moved in. The first few months of us dating was amazing; I hadn’t felt that way about anyone in years and I really thought I had found my life partner. Publicly he is a poster child for a “nice guy”— quiet, sweet, humble, chivalrous, consistent, attentive to your needs, is great with friends and strangers, and is close to his mom & sister. No one saw the Jekyl & Hyde moments I experienced behind closed doors. 

I used to listen to stories like this and think “why tf would you stay with someone whose actions show he doesn’t respect you?” What folks don’t realize is that things aren’t always bad, and the “bad” don’t appear all at once. It’s like a slowly boiling pot; when you’re in it, you don’t notice. In the beginning, You start dating, get attached, have your inside jokes, affection, love and plans for the future. They have their qualities and do all kinds of sweet things. And all of that sets the tone so that when something “off” does happen, you make excuses or believe them when they say you’re the problem. You think “this has to be a misunderstanding (or my fault) because he’s been so perfect” so you justify and disregard the red flags. and then things revert back to “normal” after the incident because he pretends it never happened and does something affectionate/sweet. This is trauma bonding and creates an unhealthy cycle, 

Below are some of the  🚩 starting at month 4 and then increasing til the end of our relationship:

🚩 1) criticisms about my clothes/personality/intelligence started. All the things he had complimented me on previously in the beginning were becoming wrong or irritating to him. He’d make insulting comments & when I’d tell him his words were hurtful, he’d say “you’re too sensitive”, “it’s just a joke”, that I “misunderstood him”, or “we don’t click because I didn’t get his jokes”. He’d dismiss my feelings to avoid taking accountability for the impact his words had, or he’d trigger my abandonment issues by saying “I wonder if we are right for each other because you don’t think my jokes (insults) are funny” when I objected to the comments he said to me 

🚩2) DARVO - “Deny, attack, reverse the situation to be the victim and you the offender”. He could never take accountability, or apologize for his actions. He would deny he did something or “didn’t remember doing it” (that I saw or heard him do just moments before), or there was always a justification, of “well you did XYZ” or “the look on your face made me” to excuse him lashing out. Whenever I tried to discuss an issue with him, he would flip the conversation to focus on something he was unhappy with me about, resulting in us talking in circles, arguing, me defending myself against a bizarre statement or accusation, and us focusing on something unrelated to the issue i originally tried to address. 

🚩 3) Extremely insecure - ex: he lashed out at me and said that I was “FLAUNTING I had been with well endowed men” Because I had magnum condoms in my dresser drawer. Ie Birth control. That he himself used with me and fit. He said that “me having those condoms was the equivalent of him keeping another woman’s bra as a trophy”. I had never once mentioned his size to him and was perfectly happy with our intimacy. He still had boxes of “ribbed for her pleasure” condoms from previous partners that we did not use because I didn’t  like them and I never had an issue with it. But claiming that I was “flaunting I had been with large men before him” because of the condoms was bizarre & showed me a glimpse of how insecure he was 

🚩 4) He saw any negative reaction in response to his actions as an attack against him. If I was quiet/feeling hurt/no longer upbeat and chatty because of something he did, he would get upset at me. He’d argue that I was wrong to feel that way, and say that I was “causing drama” and “ruining the day”. He’d ask me what I was thinking and then get upset if I was “thinking negatively of him”

🚩5) small lies that I later found out about. These things wouldn’t have mattered if he had just been transparent. But they are reflective of bigger issues with honesty,  and immaturity. Looking back, I realize that his M.O was to omit information, or provide just enough info to mislead you into the wrong assumptions. This was intentional to paint him in a good light. 1) He told me that since our first meeting, he hadn’t gone on any dates with any other women. That was a lie. 2) we went to his friend’s bday dinner and I noticed an “off energy” between him & the woman sitting next to him on his other side. I asked him about her. He stated she was a friend of a friend who was going through a divorce, but omitted the fact that they had slept together in the summer. I found out months later and realized why she had been so awkward around me at dinner. Prior to the dinner that night we had agreed to be in a monogamous relationship, so were discussing boundaries/preferences regarding exs/old flings. We made an agreement that if we were attending social events together where there would be a person we had a history with, we’d both like to be told and given a heads up. When I confronted him he conveniently “didn’t remember having that agreement with me” 3) he was adamant that he didn’t watch 🌽 but I found out he’s subscribed to 25+ different reddit communities & women’s profiles that depict explicit videos and “solo performances” of college age women. And of course, he was indeed cheating on me and gaslight TF out of me the entire time. 

🚩 6) Devaluing me. In the beginning he told me it was “rare to find a woman like me who wasn’t entitled, who offered to pay for things, who showed appreciation, who could cook and was beautiful & down to earth”.. But towards the end, he devalued my domestic & financial contributions and asked me “what value do you actually bring to this relationship?”. 

Example: Our place was OCD clean because of me, and 100% cleaner than when he lived in his own bachelor apartment. When he lived alone he hadn’t cleaned his bathroom or scrubbed his toilets during the first 3 months I knew him and was coming over to his apartment. 
- Financially we split things equitably; our agreement was that I bought, prepped & cooked all of our weekday dinners, did 90% of the household cleaning, & paid for smaller items out (coffee, comedy show tickets, small date activities). His income was 3 times more than mine so he took care of rent and weekend dinners, and did his own laundry/put his dishes in the dishwasher. We each took care of our own personal bills. 
- I had left clutter on the table for two days (I had just started a new job) and he used this to spin a story to his mom that made it seem like I never picked up after myself, & as if I wasn’t already doing 90% of the domestic duties. I was the only one who was wiping down the kitchen counters every night because he left tea and food stains, I took out the trash, scrubbed the toilet, bath tub and sinks weekly. Not once did he clean a bathroom while we lived together. I did Vacuuming, dusting, and washing sheets every 2 weeks. He got upset because he vacuumed twice in a 3 month period and told me I didn’t do enough (but somehow everything was just magically clean for him) 

🚩 7) He started rubbernecking/checking out other women in front of me. When it first happened I told him that I understood it’s human nature to notice attractive people, but I’d appreciate if he just glanced discretely and to not stare or do double takes. His response was to deny he did it, that I “imagined it”, that I “didn’t know the difference between a glance and a stare”, and then that he was just “trying to figure out if he knew her”. He kept gaslighting me. Later he said “it’s unfair because if you look at my face when attractive women are around, you’re obviously going to see me checking them out. I feel like I’m under a microscope. It’s controlling”.  

He reversed the situation so that he was somehow the victim and I was “controlling” because I verbalized that it hurt me., rather than acknowledge that he was disrespecting me as his partner. This continued the rest of the relationship (Yet somehow he could control his staring the week his mom visited, and the first 4 months of us dating. Yes, I should’ve left I know.). It impacted my confidence and decreased my desire to want to be physically intimate with him. And he got resentful towards me with that. He couldn’t seem to understand cause and effect

🚩 8) He used my past/trauma to dismiss my feelings or questions regarding his behavior. When I saw things that any human would ask about (shoulder length curly hair in the shower that wasn’t mine, a woman’s picture popping up on his iwatch, someone calling him that he sent immediately to voicemail, him closing out of a message when I came near, changed behavior with keeping his phone on his body/pocket at all times while at home and going to the bathroom constantly but not actually using the bathroom), it would turn into an argument about my trust issues. Asking questions in response to things he did would be dismissed as me “not trusting him”. I found out later that he had cheated on me with at least two other women. This guy gaslight me for months, telling me I needed anxiety medication, & I was  “treating him unfairly because of my past” while he was guilty the entire time.  

🚩 9) I found myself apologizing constantly for things that weren’t my fault, and that I shouldn’t have needed to apologize for. Ie - apologizing for “hurting his feelings by telling him something he did hurt me”

10. 🚩 I stopped speaking up at things that bothered me to avoid arguing. I became a shell of who I was & constantly felt anxious and started questioning my value, my appearance, my personality. He thought things “were going great” during these times, because I silenced myself. 

11. 🚩 Before me, He had a very promiscuous history, casually seeing & jumping from girl to girl every few weeks, seeing multiple girls at the same time, and being known as a player in his friends group. He painted a picture of him wanting to find a life partner, and just not having met the right one, but his actions and history show a Peter Pan syndrome. Even when he was dating his ex of 3 years, he cheated on her and hopped into a new relationship within a month of them ending. 

12. 🚩 he kicked me and my dog out of the home we shared, with less than 12 hours notice. I packed up as much of my things and went to a friends place. Then he changed his mind. And then did it again within 24 hours. And then changed his mind. What prompted that from him? I told him my therapist thought he was a covert narcissist. He was berating me and blaming me for everything wrong in our relationship because I said “it’s unfair to make everything my fault and it takes two people” and that triggered him to go on a condescending tirade to where I snapped and said my therapist thought he was a covert narcissist 

At the end of the day, I have no animosity towards him. I’m more mad at myself that I allowed the treatment to continue/happen; that I kept myself in a situation that was damaging my self esteem

I realize he is a deeply insecure, emotionally immature, and unaware person. It seems that his way of approaching conflict, communication, internalized beliefs and views of women were impacted by a stepfather who was emotionally and verbally abusive to his mom behind closed doors at home (but publicly was a “nice guy” and had a great social image). His bio dad cheated on his mom, and that’s why they divorced. He shared that Growing up his bio dad was a very critical, controlling and emotionally absent father who was hyper focused on image. So ultimately he had two male adults who never taught him emotional self regulation, and he never saw a healthy male/female relationship, or how to work through conflict & communicate vulnerably and with accountability. His mother taught him how to cater to women and to do things that make him “a gentleman”, but my impression was that she has a “my son can do no wrong & is perfect” attitude. These things all impact him as an adult but he is incapable of seeing or acknowledging it. The results of that is a mental cost to anyone he dates.

**Overview**

Novus Roleplay was founded on the premise that the most important part of roleplay was the players' ability to create the character scenes they wanted. We view the job of our community to facilitate a supportive, quality atmosphere for players. Novus is based in the non-lore State of New Malverne, offering El Reno, Prescott Lake, and Alpine Beach.

Our development team has spent thousands of hours remodeling/texturing the GTA V environment for this immersive experience. Our cities are where characters live, laugh and love while crime, despair, and conflict brew just under the surface.

**Planting Your Roots.**

*Create a Story, with Epic roleplays mixed all over.* To help guide character development, Novus RP uses character alignments. Pick from nine different character paths and create the story. Be ready to engage with other stories along the way.

**Live. Work. Play.**

Your character moves to a new city or wakes up to a new morning where they’ve been their entire life. Where do you choose for your character to live? Options await. Each character has a different path that we know you’ve thought a lot about including work. Our player-managed businesses are meant to serve as a base. Player-owned businesses allow you to come up with your new ideas, rent or buy an available shop, and create roleplay opportunities. The character you’ve created has spent their time working hard selling coffee, putting out fires, or maybe slinging drugs. Time to have fun and play in a city full of options.

**No Admission Required.**

*We break down the walls to give you options.* While your character must meet the IC minimums, there are no OOC walls you must leap over to do fun things like start a business, creating a faction or having an idea featured in the server. It is our goal to erase ‘click’ or ‘friend favoritism’ mentalities, leading to a more fair roleplay community.

**Pure Life Economy.**

In-server currency is evenly earned by players both legally or illegally. *No items are spawned in, or obtainable through ‘pay to pay’ patreon subscriptions or donator perks.* We aim to make it fair for all.

**No Lag or Poor Equipment.**

All of Novus Roleplay facilities are hosted on a 100% Dedicated Server with industry-leading components and a fast internet uplink. This means your player data will save and you can expect little to no server lag. We don’t cut corners.

1g1k5es,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1g1k5es/i_bagged_the_man_of_my_dreams_update/,I BAGGED THE MAN OF MY DREAMS! (Update),"2 months ago, I posted [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1eulyzh/ive_met_the_man_of_my_dreamswith_no_idea_on_how/) and received an overwhelming amount of support and people wanting an update. Well, I'm here to tell you THAT IS WAS A SUCCESS!

But I like to yap, so let me backtrack...

It's been 2 months of senseless pining, but during that time we grew incredibly close. We had lunch together almost every day of the week and constantly messaged each other. We even formed a little friend group consisting of us, his friend I mentioned in the previous post, and another person (more on them both later...).

I feel like I've been sent test after test these months to see if I was as legit about my feelings for him as I thought (Spoiler: I was). I'm very self-aware, so I know the whole ""love at first sight"" thing comes across as immature and doomed to feel, so imagine my surprise when my feelings only grew deeper every day.

The first test happened shortly after I met my man (let's call him Mack to make this not so confusing). Basically, I met another guy around the same time, and he asked me to hang out with him one day. we hung out and just walked and talked for like 4 hours, which I thought was fine at the time, but in retrospect he really just trauma-dumped and asked for reassurance on everything (""Am I an asshole? Am I pretentious? Am I ugly? Am I annoying?"")...but I digress. Anyways, I started getting the vibe that he was into me, to which I immediately texted my friend back at home--and I quote: ""CODE RED! I'm pulling--but I'm pulling the wrong man!""

It's worth noting that had I not met Mack, I probably would've accepted the guy's offer, or at the very least entertained it. As I said before, I was fully boy sober and eager to be in a relationship. But in that moment, none of that matters. I didn't even hesitate to tell the guy about Mack and how I was into him instead. I didn't want to be with anyone if not him. I only knew Mack for a week at this point.

The rest of that evening with that guy was awful...he pulled a ""Just leave...everyone always leaves me..."" and I DIDN'T cause I FELT BAD--but I really should've. Cause we got lost. For an hour. And he sulked the whole time. And apologized repeatedly (""I fucked this up...I fuck everything up!"") and I had to gentle parent and coddle him cause I thought he was going to cry...a terrible night, really. I told him we'd still be friends, and this wouldn't change anything--and meant it at the time--but every time he asked to hang out I denied, and eventually just ghosted him. That's very out of character for me, but just the idea of someone wanting me that wasn't Mack made me uncomfortable.

The next day, there was a block party on campus, to which I very nonchalantly asked him to join me (verbatim: ""I beg of you""). Of course, I love to run my mouth, and was curious how he'd react, so I told him the whole story of what transpired (Well, minus the fact that HE came up...). And hyperanalyzed every response. To my surprise he was...kinda angry? Not ANGRY angry...more of a like ""okay, what the fuck?"" He kept bringing it up, saying like ""Where is that fucker; you have to point him out to me""--which I did (and mainly the reason why I ghosted him, cause God forbid Mack get he impression that I changed my mind). 

The party was great, though. He stood by my side the whole time, grabbed my arm when I almost fell, posted pictures of us together...what more can I ask? At this point, I was seriously debating just biting the bullet and asking him out, but ultimately decided against it. We were becoming such good friends and I didn't wanna fuck that up. Plus...we just met. Again--it's been a week. So instead, I chose to do something absolutely unthinkable of me, historically speaking.

I decided to work on myself.

I started dressing better, started doing skincare, got a haircut, went to the gym, even started discreetly wearing MAKEUP. I worked on my confidence, my anxiety, my self-esteem...started eating better, started sleeping batter started getting out more, being social, started studying (okay that one's a lie). I even came out to my parents (which didn't turn out great, but Mack supported me throughout). I started to watch as I became a man that i was proud to be. And I came to the realization that regardless of how Mack felt about me, he indirectly encouraged me to become the best version of myself--and I would forever be thankful for that. And in the process, I came up with what will be my life philosophy moving forward:

""I have no control over the actions, thoughts, or feelings of others.""

LORE DUMP: I have struggled with severe anxiety and depression my entire life. I was diagnosed with OCD at 9--which enduced severe psychosis at several points in my life. I was screened for bipolar disorder and schizoid personality disorder at 15--both of which I don't have, but goes to show how low my mental health used to be. But in these few months, I became the happiest I had ever been. Genuinely. Every day has been a blessing, and I can't believe I used to think my life was not worth living. Thinks got better...things got ASTRONOMICALLY better. I'm so grateful to be alive.

Anyways, once I started to see myself as attractive and worthy of love, I started to...suspect...

I realized he was actively seeking out my company--asking me out to lunch nearly every day, finding me between classes, asking to meet up when he got on campus early. He became touchy--patting my hand or arm reassuringly, gently touching me to get my attention, hell--one day he just randomly hugged me (I thought I was going to pass out then and there). But then I started to panic.

RE: The new friend I mentioned earlier. Great person. Love him. But the voices is my head kept throwing out scenarios that he and Mack would get together. But I couldn't have been more wrong.

One day, after Mack left for class, me and the new friend and Mack's old friend (they will be relevant soon, I promise) were eating together. Then he mentioned how he invited Mack to go to a show with him that day, and he declined. Well, later that day I posted on my story asking if anyone wanted to see a movie with me (it was Whiplash's 10th year anniversary in theaters if you must know). And what do you know...Mack said yes. So he blew of the other person to hang out with ME instead...interesting...

So we went to the movies together, but since I publically invited pretty much the whole university we weren't alone--one of my other friends came with us. And third wheeled. Poor guy. I mean, there was nothing inherently homoerotic going on, just some tension mayhaps.

Keep in mind that this guy is a cishet frat boy and we're two very obviously and openly queer men, but unlike most of his breed he was actively trying to educate himself. But he's a pretty blunt guy...and he just asked us ""I don't mean to sound rude, but...what are y'all?"" of course, in reference to our sexuality. Mack answered pretty shortly after, but I didn't really say anything (I was raised in the deep south and have literally been hatecrimed so erm forgive me if it's a little hard to explicitly state my sexuality). And until I answered, he kept being all like: ""Hey, you never answered the question..."" ""It's still your turn..."" ""...okay, now you go."" And I'll admit...I was just curious to see how long he'd persist cause...hmm why do you wanna know so bad???? You want me, perhaps?????

I told him I was gay, don't worry. No room for miscommunication of any kind. But that wasn't the end of our accidental third-wheel accidentally third-wheeling...

Me and Mack were bantering, as men do, about uh...me having an intimate relationship with his father. Cause that's what men joke about. And third-wheel frat boy tuned in too late and this interaction took place:

""What are y'all talking about?"" ""He \[me\] is in a scandelous relationship."" ""Oh...with you \[Mack\], Right?""

The silence was deafening. Neither of us said anything. And we just ignored it...but oh my god, thank you accidental third-wheel cishet frat boy ily.

Things shifted between us after that day. We started subtly flirting with each other...well, it became less and less subtle. My favorite instance was when we were in line at Subway and our sandwiches got put in the oven at the same time and he said ""I bet our sandwiches are kissing in there."" We both started posting shit on our stories about wanting a boyfriend, or a relationship, or date ideas, or our type, or--my favorite--not knowing if someone is flirting or just being nice.

Around this time, I started getting really really close with Mack's older friend (older as in he knew them longer, they're the same age as us). And so, I decided enough is enough and I told them about my feelings for Mack. They freaked out. And there we were, giggling in the mall over a boy as I gushed. They really pulled their weight as my wingman. They made sure to always bring me up in conversation with him, would sit far from me so he would be forced to sit beside me, just simple but effective shit like that. God, I love my friends.

And then the second test happened.

A guy I had a serious crush on in high school (who I was pretty sure liked me back at the time) messaged me after 2 years of little to no contact, saying he broke up with his girlfriend...a few days later saying I had a glow-up (which I did, thank you)...and a few days later--he slid up on my flirtatious post that was targeted at MACK not HIM. Calling me hot and funny and wondering how I was single. I was honest and told him I wasn't interested, but told him I was into him in high school. And then he freaked out and said he was into me too. We had a long conversation, ending with a ""Well, if you're ever back in town, hit me up.""

This was the ultimate confirmation that how I felt about Mack was serious. Because prior, I EXPLICITLY said that if my crush from high-school ever asked to...well--hit him up--I would accept, no questions asked. And here it was: my fantasy for several years literally unfolding before my eyes and the only thing I could think was not in a million years. The only thing I could think was how much I wish Mack was saying that instead.

CUT TO: Wednesday, October 9th, 2024. 2 days ago.

I was at a party, and posted yet another flirtatious meme targeted at Mack. And he slid up. And I guess a wave of confidence came over us both, and we hardcore flirted for 2 hours straight. Explictly...no ""is this platonic?"" ""is this a joke?"" None of that. This was real, and we both know it. And I'm proud to admit that I do, in fact, have rizz.

Everyone else at the party is literally watching Terrifier (that fucking clown movie) and screaming and yelling and freaking out and I'm in the corner blushing and giggling at my phone. The real terror in ""Terrifier"" was homosexuality.

Now we're in this awkward, ""What are we?"" phase...right? The uncomfortable transition between platonic and romantic relationships? Where you don't know where the line is until you cross it?

LMAO NO NOT EVEN CLOSE

The next day we're just straight up acting like we've been dating for months. Holding hands, leaning against ecah other, hugging for WAY too long...it was incredible. A literal dream come true. 2 months of pining with a perfect reward, no trials or tribulations. I bagged the man I had been fawning over since the moment I saw him.

Today was the real dream come true, though. We met up in the morning, got coffee, held each other...then met up later and studied together, mostly silent but just enjoying each other's prescence...then met up later for lunch, drove to the lake nearby, held each other some more...AND WE HAVE OUR FIRST OFFICIAL DATE TOMORROW.

This is crazy. I feel like I'm dreaming. There's no way this is real. This has to be a joke. I just bagged the man of my dreams.

I have never been in an mlm relationship...I've only been with a woman (I didn't know I was gay at the time don't hate me). I hated being in that relationship for \*obvious\* reasons, but partially because I was forced to fufilll the ""masculine"" role. I payed for everything, I made the first move, I draped my arm over her shoulder, I initiated everything--I was ""the man."" But I'm not...""manly""...per se. I'm short and sassy and have a high-pitched voice. Everyone assumes I will play the ""feminine"" role in a relationship. But I'm not ""feminine"" either. I always hated the heteronormative roles imposed by society on queer relationships. I don't wanna choose between giving and receiving affection...I want both. But it's not like that with them. There is no ""woman"" in the relationship...we are both MEN. We take turns draping our arms around each other. We both initiate affection, and both just as easily get flustered by it. It's perfect. It's everything I've ever wanted. HE'S everything I've ever wanted.

Another thing about mlm relationships is EVERYONE IS STARING. And i'm okay with that, it's just a bit funny. But I can't really blame them. How many mlm relationships can you name consisting of people you've met ir' can you name? I literally cannot name one (granted, I am a southern boy as we've established). Now think of the wlw relationships you can name. I can name SEVERAL. I'm not sure why this is, and I'm not here to get into the philosophy of that, my point is--I see a heterosexual couple in public: ""Oh, look, a couple."" I see a wlw couple in public: ""Oh, look! Lesbians! Awesome!"" I see a mlm couple in pulic: ""WHAT THE FUCK THOSE ACTUALLY EXIST??????"" So um, yeah, I don't mind the staring. I would stare too.

This is in insanely long post, I'm aware. I didn't intend for it to be this long. I'm just so unbelievably happy right now. And every time I'm away from him I feel like I'm just staring into an abyss. Where is my man? I miss my man!

Me from 3 months would not believe this. ""You miss someone you've only been away from for an hour? Pathetic."" ""You've only known him for HOW long? Be for real. You can't actually feel that way. Give it time, it'll fade."" ""Love at first sight? That's ridiculous. And only exists in fiction. That's not how it works in real life.""

Anyways, I dedicate this post to all the piners, all the mlm's, all the slow-burners, and all the friends-to-lovers's. There is hope. It does get better. And 2 months is the magic number. You got this.

I love my man.",1,1728680871.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False
1g1k4x7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CBT/comments/1g1k4x7/looks_like_i_was_right_now_what/,Looks like I was right.  Now what?,"This is a bit long, I apologize for that.  I am not looking for a diagnosis here, I've already got that. I am looking for help with how to use those skills to get past this.  If I am breaking any rules, please forgive me.  
  
I (55F) went to CBT for a while to deal with Depression, PTSD and GAD.  One of the main things I focused on was my belief that my mother can't stand me and doesn't want me around.  I learned how to challenge those thoughts and refute them, trying to rewire my brain.  I started giving her the benefit of the doubt.  I have spent almost a year believing I had that beat.

Today I overheard my mom complaining about me to my stepdad.  She was complaining because I went to the door when I realized it was the guy in charge of a project they had to do which tore up our yard, sidewalk and street.   I wanted to make sure that my mom didn't forget to ask him about something she'd said she wanted.  Although my step dad has dementia, my mom also forgets stuff alot.  She'll ask me the same thing multiple times over the course of a few days.  So I didn't want her to be disappointed if she forgot to say something before they were finished.

I mostly kept quiet until they got around to that subject.  When I began to think my mom had forgotten about it, I brought it up.   She started glancing at me, and giving me that look.  (the one she gets when I'm convinced I'm embarrassing her.  I have ADHD, and she feels guilty about the fact that she gave me hell about certain behaviors I've had all my life only to find out I can't help it.)   I just ignored it, assuming she was stressed.

When he left I went back to what I was doing, heading upstairs.  As I was coming down with a load of laundry, I overheard her talking to my stepdad.   She was complaining about me standing there, actually making fun of me.  She then said she just wished I went upstairs, she didn't need me there.   I've never mentioned to her about her memory issues, mostly because she's narcissistic as hell and I just don't want to fight that battle.

But now I kinda feel like all that time I spent in therapy was a total waste of time, because it turns out I was right.  I learned alot of really good skills during that therapy, I still try to do them, but I struggle.  

So how do I use those CBT skills I learned to help me get past the fact that I was right?  She IS embarrassed of me, and DOES want me gone.  Clearly she's got issues, and whatever her issue is with me, that's her circus, not mine.  But it still hurts.  How do I deal with the fact that no one wants me around?   Not one person in my family cares about me.  Not one.  I keep catching things, noticing things.   I almost had myself convinced I was imagining things, but turns out I just made myself bury it, forced myself to NOT notice what's been right in front of me all along. 

Just for clarity, I'm currently trying to get approved for disability, I have so many issues, mental and physical.  And if I am approved, my next go is to GTFO of here as fast as I can, so I can put all of this behind me, and heal, and move on with my life.  I've lived on my own before, and no one ever came to visit.   No one called me or texted me to find out how I was doing.  Not even when my mother disowned me years ago and didn't speak or reach out to me for over a decade.  No one bothered to find out my side of that story.  Even when they found out she disowned me because I was marrying a black man and she didn't want HER friends to think less of her.  (""No decent white man will ever want you after you date or marry a black man.""  I'll never forget her saying that to me.)   Granted, my siblings did tell her she was wrong, they did tell her that, and called her out.  But not once did any of them bother to reach out to me.

I could go on but this is already too long and I'm out of coffee.   TLDR:  After going through therapy to learn how NOT to ""jump to conclusions""  it turns out that I was right about my mom (and family) being embarrassed by me and not wanting me around.  I don't know how to get past this.  How do I use my CBT skills I learned to get past this?    
  
When my mind reminds me that she doesn't want anything to do with me, how do I refute that now?  I can't convince myself that she doesn't mean it.  She does.   What do I tell myself now?",1,1728680832.0,CBT,1,1.0,False

1g1k13m,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1g1k13m/baby_steps_but_some_progress/,"Baby steps, but some progress!","Not sure if my situation translates well, but I took some positive baby steps this morning and felt the need to share.

Some background highly relevant background - my wife (47F) has a past history of trauma and depression from growing up with a father who was verbally and sometimes physically abusive towards her mother. She has also  been dealing with severe burnout from work and left her job about a year ago.

On my end, I (49M) am not great at communicating - especially when it comes to my own needs/wants. I started seeing a therapist earlier this year to deal with this as it applies to both my personal and professional life. Over the course of the year, my therapist has helped me see that on top of everything else, I am dealing with loneliness and a level of depression over the lack of connection and intimacy with my wife - something that I'm guessing we're all pretty familiar with. My therapist has also identified a need for me to develop some 'healthy narcissism,' and develop the ability to ask for things I want.

Other relevant details - we have a 9 year old son, and we've had sex about 5 times in the last 10 years.

Anyway, long story short, with our son back in school again this fall, we've been trying to get one day a week when we can grab coffee together after our son is off to school. We had a few false starts when my wife forgot the last two weeks in a row, but we managed to go out this morning. 

With the help of a lot of reinforcement from my therapist, I was finally able to express some of what I am looking for. I managed to overcome my own sex negative bullshit and finally tell her that I craved physical intimacy and crave her. She didn't respond with the enthusiasm I would have hoped for, but she positively acknowledged my desire and said that there was more to talk about away from a public coffee shop.

FInally, I managed to ask the question I've been avoiding because I was scared of the answer - I acknowledged that I don't even know what she wants and whether she also wants physical intimacy. And she said she does, but it's complicated. Not the tear our clothes off and have sex in the coffee shop response I may have fantasized about, but I felt a real relief to know that she wants some sort of physical relationship..

The 'it's complicated' may still turn into a pain point, but I know this has to do with her physical and mental health. I'm happy to support her, but if she's willing to acknowledge that she wants a physical relationship, I have to hold on to hope the we can work through this.

Most importantly, I took the learnings from therapy and closed out the conversation with an explicit want of my own - I asked that we have the follow-up conversation about this in the next week and not have several weeks of me in mental turmoil waiting, and she said yes to this.

I know it's just baby steps, but for the first time in years there's a chance of things changing.",4,1728680529.0,DeadBedrooms,0,0.83,False

In the aftermath of this storm wrecking people’s houses, I wanted to donate some furniture to a family or a small business in need of some home goods. I want this stuff to go to somebody who needs it. Although my house didn’t experience any flooding, I’ve still got things to give to someone who needs it more than me.

If you know someone who lost furniture in the flooding, point them my way. I’ve got two comfy chairs, a coffee table, a couple of end tables, a small set of patio furniture, an entertainment center, and a sleeper sofa. All of them fit in a pickup truck, and all of them are in pretty good shape. There’s some minor cat damage on the chairs from a while back, and they’re a bit older, but they’re all comfortable and undamaged by the floods. I’m going to post some pictures of the stuff I’ve got. Ideally, I’d prefer this stuff get picked up by whoever needs it, but if you need it and can’t come get it for whatever reason, I’d be happy to work with you on getting it dropped off.

  
Stay safe, Asheville.

This always seems to be the most difficult aspect for me. I generally don't want to stay in touristy neighborhoods because they tend to be busy and loud (when you want quiet time) - but I do want to be close enough so that it doesn't feel like I'm commuting every day. Aside from that, I like to have a nice cafe or small restaurant nearby (preferrably with patio) to grab coffee in the morning, or just sit outside and lounge with a drink during downtime. Aside from that, I don't really have a lot of ""must haves"" for location.

I am very bad at reading signs tho, but from what I saw I think there's a chance she like me too. Here's are a few hints I picked up: She spends a lot of free time or in between tasks talking to me, a lore more than she does to other co-workers; I randomly mentioned that it was getting hot and she jokingly started flashing a book up and down to cool me down; she jokingly also hinted that she wanted a car toy that we sell at the store and said that maybe we can give each other gifts for christmas holidays and that I should buy her the car while she gifts me something she thinks I would like; she wanted to compete with me about who gets a task done first so the loser has to get coffee; and today I asked which shift she is tomorrow and when she found out that we are not working the same shift she made a sad face.

1g1jtse,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g1jtse/two_weeks_after_the_grenade/,Two Weeks After the Grenade,"The heavy click of my front door sounds as it presses shut. I'm finally home. After all that's happened, I feel like it's all behind me now. All the people telling me how sorry they were, how terrible it was, and how it wasn't my fault. The pats on the shoulder. The gargling sniffles. The distant murmur of hazy speeches. The sea of black, with the grey stone ships. I couldn't wait to put it all behind me. The past two weeks I have sailed through almost muted. It feels like a grenade went off near me and I've heard nothing but the high pitched after-tone for 12 days. Right up until I heard the click of my door. I'm greeted by the most aggressive of silences. I can put it all behind me now.

No, I can't. I'm leaning back against the closed door and this is the worst I've felt since the grenade. It's too quiet. Too different. I can hear the silence laughing at me, mocking my lonesome. It slaps me continuously. As I walk through the corridor into each passing room, I see my wife. She's reading a book by the fire in the study, and she's wiping her hands on a towel in the bathroom. She's telling me about her work day while laughing and imitating. We’re walking through the corridor together. I look into the kitchen and she's dancing to the smells of apple pie and coffee. Slap. Slapped by another crushing reality. The kitchen is cold. The dishes haven't been washed, and there is a green and black mould pie on the counter.

I miss her. It's 9.03pm, around the time we cuddle up for one of our TV shows. I can hear the theme for one of them playing now. As I walk into the front room, the TV is on but muted, flicking between dull Tuesday night TV. I find the remote control stuck under one of the chair legs. It must have been continuously flicking between channels like this since the grenade. Just as I switch it off, I catch a glimpse of a woman shrieking in horror. It looked like a close-up shot of a face in complete agony. I only saw it for a second before switching off the TV, but it was so striking that I could have sworn I heard the screaming even though there was no sound.

I rub my eyes and let out a dejected yawn. It's been a long couple of weeks. Feels like one long moment of days pressing into each other. I've hardly had any sleep. Tonight would be the first night I sleep in that bed again. I'm so exhausted of life. I expect to see and hear things when I'm this tired. For example, I just heard something coming from the kitchen. Something slamming. I walk over to it and the fridge door is open. I guess it was open all this time, but I can't help but feel a little spooked by it. I decide to make myself a coffee. Not the dark-roasted brewed coffee she used to conjure. This one is lukewarm, thick and muddy.

I take my reduced coffee through the corridor on the way to the study, and I'm absolutely convinced something is following behind me. No sound, no physical contact. I can feel a strange energy behind me. I remember when my wife told me she would have the same feelings of something following behind her after watching or reading something scary. Following behind her through the house as she switched off the lights. Turning back to check didn't help because it turns behind with you, constantly staying at your six. She told me she would resort to communicating with it, as a result of a calmly justified terror. She would just tell herself ""No"". Or she’d be denying the follower, or whatever that would hear her - ""no"". She said it worked all the time, and helped herself snap out of any silly paranoia.

""No."" I try to convince myself that I too am being silly. The thought crosses my mind, but the feeling gets stronger and closer behind me. ""No! Wait!"" I spill my coffee as I turn around sharply. I'm greeted by the living room door cracked open slightly, and through it I see the TV on again, and muted. Like I said, I'm exhausted. I'm spooked too, but I've been like this before where I'm so tired that I seem to play tricks on myself.

I ignore the TV at this point. I turn again to walk towards the study. The feeling is there behind me again, but this time it's more of a pest than unnerving. It can follow me if it wants to.

I put the cup of coffee down on the desk and switch the table lamp on. The room is warmer than the rest of the house, and the light fits the thoughtful mood of a study. I realise I've hurt my hand pretty bad. There's a red mark surrounded by a dark stain that smells like coffee and burnt flesh. Looking at my cup again, I can see it's piping hot, and I must have burnt myself turning around sharply moments ago. I'm starting to get quite unnerved now.

The first few layers were peeled from me due to tiredness and lack of attention. Now I'm beginning to wonder if my lack of sleep is causing me to go crazy. Not only did it feel lukewarm to the touch, but I took a few massive gulps of that searing hot coffee and felt nothing. That's how she used to like it. And she’d nurse the cup by her side for a good while until it was but warm enough to start.

My hand is throbbing in pain now. I go to the bathroom and run my hand under the cold water. I haven't seen myself ever since the grenade, but I know there's a mirror right up in front of me. I refuse to look up. The mirror is huge, almost covering the wall. I figured these past days it would be pointless seeing a reflection of just me instead of the both of us, since this is the mirror we’d clean our teeth and get dressed together in. Every time I looked into this mirror I’d see the both of us smiling. But there's that feeling again. I'm unsure if this time I won't look up because I’d see only me, or if I'd see more than just me. It feels like something is directly beside me, very close to my ear. She used to whisper in my ear a lot and I loved that. But these ones aren't whispers, it's more like a silent grin. I still refuse to look up, admittedly unsettled and afraid of what I'd see. But now is not the time. I'll look into it after a good night’s sleep.

I turn off the cold tap and dry my hands on my trousers as I walk back to the study. My armchair is now facing away from the doorway I entered. I'm now standing here afraid because I distinctly remember turning it around. It's something I always do. I walk in to the room, place down my cup, and I turn the armchair. Now it's facing the desk again, and I can see the steam coming off the coffee cup, rising up above the chair. If I'm not completely crazy, it looks like a force is being pressed down on the armchair, as if it were being sat in. I find myself slightly petrified - the television turns off and on, the coffee is bi-polar, mirrors grin at me, and I'm being followed by 6 o'clock.

Now there's someone sitting in my chair and I hear whatever or whoever sitting in the chair turning pages of a book. The pages turn slowly at first, they sound old and heavy. They turn faster as I take the first steps towards it, and faster yet the closer I get. Faster and louder the pages turn - nobody could read that fast. It's now so fast and aggressive that I can hear the pages tearing from the book, and I find myself one step behind the large armchair.

The page turning makes me deaf to my own thoughts. I'm absolutely terrified right now but I need to know for sure if it's my mental state. Surely if I'm aware of my mental stability and lack of sleep, these things can't be happening. If I'm aware of it, I should be on top of it. So why aren't I?

I lay a hand on the side of the armchair, and everything stops. No, it pauses. The page feels mid-turn, hanging in the balance. Whoever is turning it is waiting. With a swift push I rotate the armchair to face me. I hear a loud scream directed into my head, a shriek so loud I can feel the sound waves beating against my temples. I can feel something standing all of 2 inches from my face, unloading all fear into me with it's scream. It sounds so loud like it might be coming from inside me. I jump back in shock and my eyes dart around the entire room trying to catch a glimpse of the creature. Or the demon. The gate-keeper to all hells. But I see nothing. And the feeling of there being an entity begins to hide away.

The screaming can still be heard, but now it sounds like it's coming quieter from the other room as opposed to stabbing my ears in this one. I know it's coming from that channel I switched to, of the woman screaming on TV. I suppose it's the budget horror channel. She’s still shrieking loudly, as if it were on loop, and I'd peek around the corner to confirm this if I wasn't rooted to the spot in fear and confusion.

After a good 5 minutes of listening to more screams, I pluck up the courage to step off my heels. Ignoring the coffee that now looks ice cold, I check the armchair once more with a calm head and confirm there's indeed nobody there. There is however a magazine laying face first on the ground. I guess it's one of mine that I was planning on skimming through. Right now I just want to not be in this room. I heard those pages turn. I'm aware of myself, and this isn't mental grief. Those screams have now turned into distant movie ambience, and I motion slowly towards the corridor again.

I peek around the doorframe and I see the TV on with sound matching what I hear. It was muted not too long ago. With every step I take I hear a snapping sound. I'm sure it's not the floorboards, and my legs don't usually creak. It's coming from behind me, in the bathroom. And at once that 6 o'clock feeling has returned, like a wave of doom crashing against my back. I edge forward while rolling my eyes to the left to see if I can catch anything behind me. I try to simultaneously look towards the TV room in front of me and to the bathroom and study areas behind me. This house is freezing cold outside of the study.

I glimpse into the kitchen as I walk past it, and the fridge is still open. I'm not going to even deal with that now. I walk straight into the living room and turn off the TV from the electrical socket.

Sitting on my couch now, I light a cigarette. I cough my way through the first one. These aren't mine, they are my wife’s. She loves to smoke. But I need these right now. I'm terrified of this night. I should by all means call someone or run the hell away from here, but it can all still be chalked up to something rational. I scratch the side of my head, lost in thought. I've never been one to entertain any notion other than the only-if-you-see-it. And I haven't seen anything. I've just felt... things. I will look into the mirror tomorrow, and all this will go away. I'll be smiling again.

I begin to turn in for the night. I empty my pockets on to the coffee table. Cigarette lighter, car keys, wallet, and a flash drive. As I walk upstairs to the bedroom, I pass some pictures of my wife's photos. Not photos of her, but her photography. She's an inspiring photographer, and I find myself giving way to a proud smile. In the hallway upstairs I hear those cracking sounds again. This time they’re coming from the stairs behind me. It reminds me of cracking knuckles or joints, a few at a time. At this point I'm so sleep deprived that I'm more inclined to drop dead on the bed than to investigate anything further. On any other occasion I would be straight out the house, but I feel like the bed is calling me with a lullaby.

She sings to me every night with a hum. The tapping of her phone and the smacking of her lips always send me into a dreamy daze before we fall asleep. She's the snorer of the house, and I always try to fall asleep before her, but it's always her that sleeps first as I read my magazines. I open my magazine to where I left off. Turning the pages feel heavy and they make a crackling sound. I rest my head to the side against a propped up pillow, and I try to read and take my mind away from everything. The snoring behind me is a little distracting, but I'm used to it. Loud, sharp snort-like sounds are inhaled and let loose with spit and wheeze. I'm inclined to a coy smile. I turn around and shut my eyes. Tomorrow I will look in the mirror and a smile will be looking back at me. The snoring suddenly comes to a halt, and as she shuffles across the bed, I finally fall into a deep sleep.",1,1728679984.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

so i recently got a teams private message from a male coworker, who i’d consider a friend, asking me to coffee. the way it was worded seemed weirdly like he was asking me out, and less to just hang out. i showed my partner of 4 years, whom he has met MANY times. my partner said he trusts that he wouldn’t ask me out. that settled my fears and i replied back a few days later saying i would get coffee with him.

i was going to proceed as such: he does try to make a move? set him straight that im not interested. he just wanted to hang out? great! i like having friends. thing is he never replied. he also just stopped talking to me like he used to, and only reached out if it was absolutely work related. this is weird bc my company has very few employees, and in a small space so it can be a social setting and obvious when someone has a problem with you. 

we had a work dinner a few nights ago, and he brought a girl. i couldn’t tell if it was a romantic thing (people bring family and friends as a plus one sometimes), but i was assuming she was a date. my friend asked the next day at work and found out she was a date and they started dating near days after he messaged me. i tried to talk to the both of them the night of but he was very clearly ignoring me. like would actively walk out of situation if i joined them, would pretend he didn’t just make eye contact, and ignored my greeting.

so basically in conclusion i feel gross, i feel a bit cheated, and i feel scummy. definitely comes across like he was only interacting with me to get something more even though i am literally in a committed relationship. the timeline also just feels… icky for some reason? idk if i should confront it, ignore him, or what.

* I am a 22-year-old Muslim hijabi, and he is a 19-year-old Austrian. I attend evening school from 6 PM to 10 PM and work from 7 AM to 1 PM, leaving me very tired during classes.
* I'm confident, introverted, and focused on my goals. On the first day of school, I noticed a quiet guy and asked him for directions after class. He agreed to help but went to the bathroom first. Afterward, he showed me the way to my classroom.
* Although my German is basic and he's a native speaker, I felt comfortable enough to talk to him and shook his hand when we introduced ourselves.
* I always wear new, fitted clothes and a hijab, which might seem unusual, but I try to look pretty at school to hide my tiredness.
* There are many Muslims at school, including another hijabi, but they all speak perfect German. I seem to be the center of attention, possibly due to my being brown or my selective engagement. When I walk past groups talking, I don’t say hi, but I do greet individuals one-on-one. although they never say hi to me too, they get mad when i dont? as if its my duty?
* The guys at school stare at me, making me uncomfortable, as if they're waiting for me to engage with them first. i think since they ""think"" i am pretty, they expect certain people pleasing behavior from me.
* I spoke to Max, the quiet guy, and found out he’s very extroverted. He started sitting next to me and showed a lot of interest. We had to do group work together, and that's when things got complicated.
* so, i make good eye contact, maybe i am a bit flirty? i really dont know because i try to be friendly, so, we basically watch deep inside our eyes.
* He began insisting on sitting next to me, even telling his friends he wanted to switch seats to be closer. One day, he suggested we grab coffee together since we both had a free hour.
* I agreed but needed he said ""i will use the toilet please wait"" but i also had to use the bathroom first. Afterward, I couldn't find him and ended up in the library. but if i asked his friend who was around i would have found him but i simply decided i dont want to.
* Later, I learned he told the entire class about our coffee plans. After I ignored him for a bit, he caught me in the hallway, put his arm around me, and asked why I didn’t wait. His Muslim friend intervened and reminded him not to touch me. Max apologized and said he would keep his distance from now on. i also explained my point of view, that i couldnt find him and even gave him my number.
* I felt conflicted because he had gossiped about me. The next day, when he tried to approach me again, I reacted coldly, which seemed to escalate things.
* He started telling others I was ignoring him, then asked another girl if she was Muslim. When she said no, he invited her for coffee. He also stopped sitting next to me and instead sat directly behind me.
* I asked him if he was uncomfortable or angry with me, especially since he sometimes came to class tipsy. I apologized if I had made him feel that way and offered to grab coffee together, but he declined and chose to hang out with others instead.
* He then announced to his friends that he would sit next to me and share my book since he didn’t bring his. However, I ended up sitting by the window, and another classmate took the spot next to me, while the other guys teased Max about where he would sit.
* Whenever I spoke to someone else, he would eavesdrop. I noticed him talking to the girl he was using to get my attention. I sat next to a different girl and a guy he knows, leading to his friends teasing him again.
* also, he always is nervous when i am sitting behind him, he cant function.
* Today, when we received our assignments, he had mine but instead of handing it to me like everyone else, he mixed it with other papers and gave it to the teacher. I got angry and glared at him, but he just smirked, clearly enjoying the attention—whether positive or negative.
* At 22, I feel bullied like a child, and I’m left wondering if I’ve done something wrong. Am I the asshole for not putting in enough effort to meet him for coffee, for ignoring him, or for not people-pleasing? i feel like he is obsessed ",2,1728679168.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

TL;DR: I feel absolutely zero motivation to study or to do anything, but my conscience doesn't let me to completely drop it all. I end up being torn between actually studying and not caring at all, I am scared to disappoint my parents even if I know I technically already did that.  

My life has been at its absolute peak when I finished high school this year in June. I ended up as one of the best students out there, I made and fixed so much good relationships, my parents were absolutely proud of me, and I also had quite a lot of time for personal development, it was great. Worked two jobs I really enjoyed and overall, it was THE time to be alive.

 As 8th of June passed, it was hard to really realize that yes - that's it, I'm done with school and I have to move on. To clarify, these past 6 months were particularly special to me because I would have to move on to a different country to study in university. To be fair, I didn't really want to - going so far from my home to an unknown place all alone felt a bit stressful, but my mom insisted and I didn't want to disappoint her. My father was slightly against the idea and doubtful, but he did agree too. I moved out on 30th of July.

What is funnier is that the whole thing about ""being alone and foreign"" turned out now to be one of the least scary things for me there. So I went for English Studies degree, as it was being studied in English and I wasn't accepted to be a translator. That was fine for me though, at least for the time being. I lived alone since August for 2 months, but it took me to move into my dorm room to start breaking down. Entire week ever since I entered the dorm I cried almost all the time, it felt like I was so broken and neglected, so scared. As the second week started, I suddenly realized that ""huh, I don't cry anymore, maybe it's not what it seemed like"", which gave me some hope that it might get better soon. And yes, it did get better and I finished the first week of studying with some energy. It started going downhill next week, I randomly broke down during my Monday classes because pressure was a bit too overwhelming and I had to choose a topic for the presentation I didn't like, then we had to write our resume with provocative questions such as ""tell us about your home"" or ""tell us about your parents"". In all honesty, I despise group/paired projects because I already live my entire life with constant worry of letting others down, projects like these only make stakes unpleasantly higher for me. I made 3 out of 5 presentations alone and basically told my teammates ""here you go"". I started regretting my choice and I really wanted to leave. My colleague got sick today and I had to present our presentation alone, which was fair(considering that I made 100% of it), but I still feel like I let someone down because they can't get pass unless they present something themselves. Honestly I don't get why I feel slightly more happy to do things for others rather than making sure that I'm the one who succeeds. Just a few months ago I was super selfish and never did any homework for anyone unless paid, but here I am.

I can cook and I actually really like making something for myself, but I literally can't pull my ass up to do anything anymore. I limited myself from doing things I love, such as singing, drawing, writing, or even playing videogames. And that's not only because I lack motivation, but also because I don't want to do things I'd feel so much happier doing somewhere I am comfortable at. That also makes me even more repulsed and done.

Yesterday something very strange happened. I was sitting down by my laptop, doing some of my reading, but then I felt like my head started spinning for no reason at all and, all of the sudden, I somehow ended up on my bed in a snap. I felt like my heart was about to burst from my chest and my breathing got super chaotic, ringing in my ears was a clear indicator that my blood pressure rose for some reason to an unhealthy degree(I haven't drank a coffee for 2 weeks btw). Calmed down in like 15 minutes, but it was very weird and I had never had anything like this happening to me before. When it ended, I teared up - again, no reason at all.

I feel like I start slowly losing things I used to have during my school years. My friends don't really want to talk or don't have a way to, it feels like life both stopped for me and improved for others after I left, my job colleagues and other musicians/artists went on giving out concerts without me as if I had never existed at all, my parents started slowly taking various things from my room because ""I won't use them any soon"". Oh, yes, my parents. They went from supporting me on the first days to now being frustrated with me. I don't like that they don't have anything else to talk about other than my academic life and that I became too pessimistic. They know that I didn't want to go here, but insisted and now are pushing me away more and more. I am already letting down my parents by not managing to study that well, but if I fail, I will have to live with this for the rest of my life. I know I can technically study, but I don't want to. I know they expect the best from me, but I know I'm not motivated to. If I come home now, there's a big chance that it's never going to be the same. They used to say that coming back won't change anything between us and that they will welcome me, but I'm pretty sure it's said only to make me relieved, no one actually wants me there anymore. I painted a picture in my head of me coming back to my house with degree on hands, but only the first part of this seems to be possible to imagine now. My mom is sorta obsessed with the idea of me being a perfect student who does everything in time, studies in expensive university, leaves home the day he turns 18(3 months prior to that actually).

Homesickness is a terrible feeling, I've been literally lifting my mood up by looking at satellite photos from 2005 of my hometown and watching old videos of it. It honestly makes me feel even worse, but nostalgia is addicting and I've been doing that for three days now. I'm jealous of my friends who get to visit their parents and meet each other. My mom always told me that ""they will envy that I study abroad in a prestige EU university, but they only get to live with their parents or study in poor universities"", which makes me feel rather ungrateful and incredibly overestimated. One thing I know that even if I attend to all classes I will definitely fail my exams, they're pretty difficult and I am really bad at politics, history, and learning three poems to heart. I don't know why I am like that, why do I force myself to study if the result still remains the same.

I uh don't have any plans for now. I have only some ideas of what I'm going to do, either take a gap year(which might not benefit me at all unless I go home which will mean no university for me even next year) or try to somehow get the money back from the agency and find something better to do for now. If there's anything you could suggest, I'm open to it, but I'm not that desperate for any advice, I'm just tired. I wouldn't mind some support, but again, I gave up on myself kinda already.",1,1728679105.0,selfhelp,1,1.0,False

10 years ago I (32 yo/f) dated a guy (34yo). It was to this day the first and only time I felt so in love, but it lasted only a year off/on and didnt work. I was heartbroken and moved to another city after a while. I met someone else when I was 26 and we were in a relationship for 2 years until he dumped me. While we were broken up this old flame surprisingly sent a looong msg telling me how sorry he was for the way he treated me and how it had norhing to do with me, but his mental struggles at the time. He really didnt treat me badly, as I see it he just wasnt as interested in me as I was in him. Anyways, he said how sorry he was and if I ever found myself in his city I should let him know. I said thank you, no worries and wasnt in a place to meet anyone due to heartache over recent relationship. 6 months after breakup i was back together with the guy that broke up with me. My self esteem got worse, the relationship was turbulent but I still had hope and a lot of love for him. Then i got pregnant, and was miserable the whole pregnancy. 4 month along old flame(lets call him Jack, old flame is so cringe) messaged me again. I ofc ignored it. Then, 3 months after my daughter was born he msg me again, only now he asked if I wanted to call him. Without me answering he asked if he could call me and had one typo, he assured me he wasnt drinking he was only nervous. He wanted to meet, no obligations, he just really wanted to meet someone «who always meant a lot to him». (He sent other incredibly cute and thoughtful msg too but this is already very long) I told him i was charmed but that i was a new mom with a boyfriend. He congratulated me and told me he thought that was amazing. This was april 2023. I felt instant butterflies from seeing his texts and horrible guilt. I decided to do my absolute best to work on my relationship. Turns out it couldnt be saved. Ive been deeply unhappy to the point ive had crazy physical symptoms of stress, we’ve broken up 6(!) times during the past 1,5 year. But now its finally over. Were great parents to our girl, but horrible together. It feels right and suddenly i feel motivated and happy about life again. And now, suddenly, Jack is back. He wants to meet for coffee next time Im in his city, and i will in 2 weeks. Here’s my issue; while pregnant I gained 60 pounds. Ive lost a lot but im still about 160 p  and 5,7 f. I feel like i dont look like myself anymore, when I last saw Jack i was wildly broke and kinda eatingdisordered and about 120 pounds. Im terrified he wont be attracted to me anymore. Should I wait until I lost more weight to meet him? Not meet him at all? Tell him ive gained weight? Im spiraling and need some advice from the internet. Sorry for insanely long post, have trouble keeping it short in general.

Had a baby and was in toxic relationship. Got out of toxic relationship, still 20p overweight and self conscious. Now old flame from 10y ago wants to reconnect. What should I do?",1,1728678946.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

on top of that my rosacea is flaring up even more and i’ve gotten more white tongue which started after 5mg. 

i’ve also seen a few folks mention SIBO and it seems omeprazole could make it worse?! bc it’s often related to low stomach acid + slow motility. sigh. i’ll ask my doc about this but i feel like she’ll send me to the gastro for this. 

two questions: 
- if you have lpr did you get rid of it successfully with ppis? 
- if you have sibo, what were your symptoms? 

some context/stats:
- i have hypothyroidism and hashimotos
- sw: (not 100% sure bc doc scale and my scale are diff) 225
- cw: 205
- the above is my only real side effect side from post shot food aversion which only lasts a couple days. 

one more thing: i’ve seen folks mention their symptoms alleviate at higher doses. i tried a week of 7.5 (under doc advise) but went back to 5 bc the lump and chest fullness didn’t go away and i figured i should address the issue at hand before introducing more medication.

SW: 210lbs
CW: 149.6lbs
GW: first goal was 150lbs, new goal: 140lbs

I've been waiting to share my story and I think now is as good of time as any since I've met my first goal of 150lbs (down 60lbs since Feb). Never in my entire adult life have I been this weight or even close to it...in fact I've been overweight my entire life.

I started with 18:6 for approx 4 weeks then transitioned to 20:4 mostly with some 24hr, 36hr, 42hr and 48hrs sprinkled in weekly. I've also tried a 68 hr fast in Sept. 

My window is often 12-4pm or 2-6pm. Sometimes I have longer windows on the weekend as I find it harder to stick to around the kids and fun things we plan.

My kids are 5 and 1, my youngest was 7 months old when I started IF. I work from home for our family business and use black coffee and warm water to help curb hunger. I don't restrict any foods but find I naturally eat protein, good fats and veggies/fruits for carbs as opposed to the ultra processed food I used to eat all day long. I still like my desserts and chocolate but have cut way, way back.

I enjoy running and have had some of my best exercises in the fasted state. I hit a personal best of 5km in 32 mins which I was stoked about.

I think I have about 10-20lbs to go but I'm so relaxed in to the process that I know it'll happen eventually. I just bought my first ever bikini and I know I'll be able to wear it by next summer! I look OK in it now but I know I'll wear it with great confidence next summer!

It's been with me though 3 different espresso machines, ground I don't even know how many doses, certainly thousands over its life (which I realize isn't a crazy amount but it's not nothing).

Unfortunately it's come to a point where the chrome plating on the bean hopper has started to corrode. I'll caveat all this issue by saying that this is almost certainly my own fault because my workflow is stupid. I weigh out my doses directly into my Niche 58mm cup, dump them into the bean hopper, then spritz them twice with water and mix them around in there before closing the lid and grinding. I do this because I try to minimize the amount of little things on my bar and a cup specially for weighing and RDT is just another thing that I will eventually have to clean.

So after my coffee is ground there winds up being water droplets that just sit on the bean hopper and it's gotten to the point where they are pitting the chrome.

I will say that I break my grinder down roughly every 6-months and give it a thorough cleaning, but this was bound to happen eventually given my workflow.

Ironically, I'm a corrosion engineer and deal with this type of stuff every single day....but i try to keep the rust observing to work hours only (literally impossible once you realize that it's literally everywhere, entropy is terrifying).

I've already contacted Niche customer support and they're shipping me a new one for £40 which is totally fair. Just figured I would share my story in case anyone else is just as lazy as i am and also has a Niche.

1g1jc65,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1g1jc65/am_i_entirely_at_fault_here/,Am I entirely at fault here?,"Recently a girl (20F) broke up with me (21M). We met on Instagram and started dating after a lot of message exchanges. At first, she was really invested. In fact, I was trying to be a bit more reserved, but she went all in and shared a lot of personal stuff about her personal life early on. That made me open up and go all in too. After a month of dating, she was the one to put a label on us (bf and gf status), and although that went a tad too quickly for my taste, I went along with it. And then the problems just kept rolling...

I had a big problem with her male friends. Now, usually, I am not overly jealous. I am perfectly fine with my girlfriend having male friends, going clubbing in mixed gender groups and even hanging out one on one (for this one though, I am a lot more comfortable after meeting the friend at least once). However, a lot of her friendships were serious red flags:

*  Her ex, 35, and they dated for about 3 months a year and a half ago. Despite breaking up due to the age gap, they remained on good terms, occasionally meeting for coffee. She said he was someone she could confide in, which made me uncomfortable, as I worried he'd influence our relationship negatively. Eventually, she agreed to stop contact but didn’t initially explain that they were part of the same friend group, which caused unnecessary concern, and I then told her I had no problems with them hanging out in the said group and communicating from time to time.
* The second guy was from a neighboring country, and they met through a volunteering conference. They only saw each other once or twice a year when he visited, but their interactions resembled full-day outings, like trips to the pool, the zoo, and lunches, which felt more like dates than casual hangouts. My main concern arose when I found a picture on his Instagram highlights. In the photo, he was standing behind her, his arm wrapped tightly around her neck in a close, almost intimate embrace. She leaned back into him, clearly comfortable. To make it worse, he had tagged her in the post and added a heart emoji, which made the whole interaction seem much more personal. Given that they had only met a few times, this kind of picture felt inappropriate and far beyond a platonic friendship. When I confronted her about it, she insisted it was harmless, but the image and the way he presented their relationship on social media made me uncomfortable. After we argued, she said she’d block him because it upset me.

* The third guy was a patient (she works as a nurse), and married with two kids. Initially, I was fine with their friendship, but my concerns grew when she admitted his wife didn’t know about their meetups. He frequently complained about his wife, saying she didn’t care about him, and my girlfriend suggested that his wife didn’t need to know since they rarely met up. Also, they met up with him giving his number to her (already married with one kid at the time). This made me uneasy, as it seemed like he was interested in more than just friendship. She offered to stop one-on-one meetups, and I suggested meeting him and his wife together, and she dismissed that because ""she dislikes her because she is horrible to her friend."". The guy also ignored the option of the three of us meeting up when she proposed it.

She did cut off all these men for me, really a stranger in her life, in order to make me comfortable. However, all these situations at almost the same time, combined with the stress of me finishing my undergrad CS degree, working part time, taking care of my sick mother, lack of sleep and all other sh\*t that I was going through- made me the most insecure and undesireable person on the planet at the time. It did not help that physical intimacy was moving quite slowly (it moved quick in the beginning but then she pulled away and said she needed ""more trust"", this happened before all these situations with her friends), and she was not very touchy feely (yet she clearly was with her ""friend"" number two). She did not flirt much and compliment me much and those things made me very insecure and clingy. Honestly, I wouldn't have dated myself in that state, even though I tried to make up later with sweet messages, little gifts, planning dates and working on myself. However, she clearly pulled away and waited for me to start the conversation (slowly breaking my heart in the process instead of confronting me when I felt something was off and asked her multiple times). I am still mad about it because I am aware that I was at the lowest and most insecure point of my life, and I believe it could have worked if all these red flag situatuions did not show up so early and so close to each other. I understand that she was fed up and tired from fighting, but I really liked her and my heart is torn to shreds.

Couch - 81x53 (full dimensions when pulled out. the light green part tucks back into the couch when not in bed mode)

desk - 43x24 (I like the idea behind my desk facing a wall of some sort so when my camera is on it doesn't show the room behind me)

Coffee table - 24x48

tv stand - 48x12 (this one is optional. ideally its in the room, but no biggie if it doesnt work)

Ideally i have an ""art area"" where I can have a small crafting corner of some sort. but again, optional given the space, but I think it could work somehow. Please help, open to all ideas

  
The dark gray bits are random corner jut outs and the AC unit, non-removable. Dimensions of the items are below. Also if any of you have ideas on the rug size I should be getting for the final set up.

A spot on sand hill road beside the library. They had a sign saying open so we got excited and walked in. We weren’t expecting a gourmet meal by any stretch. After the informal greeting we were asked to sit at the bar and were given a “carefully curated” menu with 7-8 things on it. The lowest priced item being $5 chips and guacamole. A medium priced item $12 being the Philly cheese steak. So we got the Philly and chips and guacamole. After ordering the bar back handed us a wrapped in paper and plastic sandwich like you’d buy bulk at Sam’s. Basically a hot pocket as a sandwich. Probably the box itself would be $20 or less for 8 of them. Not positive but that’s a fair price for the box in my opinion. At which point we were told “there’s a sandwich press over there so you can make it yourself. Health department won’t let me touch it”. So we pressed our sandwiches one at a time for 5 minutes each and cold juice still dripped out. But we ate it cos we’re hungry hungry hippos. There was a basket with bags of chips in it and I asked if the ($12) sandwich came with chips. No. But I could get a bag cos chips and guacamole. So we went to sit and were given a cup of guacamole. Not a coffee cup or a drinking cup but the kind like the boars head hummus comes in. So the bag of chips and tiny guac was $5. We were asked what we wanted to drink and after seeing the prices we were about to pay for the sad excuse of food we had we said water. We ate as fast as we could because the whole scene was just depressing as fuck with old retirees sipping mixed drinks in silence and us being too nice to walk out when we were told “go heat up your sack sandwich”. We also really like the place and thought we wanted to help support them right now cos they also are trying to get by. But the final nail in the coffin was when we got the check and we were charged $1 for each “thirster” brand water bottle. We weren’t at all expecting a free meal. We knew the pay to play was in effect. But I stopped into old school subs today when I wanted lunch and they gave for free a killer turkey sandwich, bag of chips, soda/water, apple, and condiments. We aren’t gonna go back and maybe im in the wrong for airing this right now but holy fuck…how can you charge these stupid insane prices for Junior high school slop and then on top of it while there’s a water shortage charge for water. Yes they have to survive. We all do. And this was a luxury opportunity for us that we chose to waste. Idk.

Just to clarify, I do not have any experience as a barista. I had the opportunity to practice for 3-4 hours at a pub, making coffee and some other drinks (also serving people as a waitress), but that's it. Truly enjoyed it with enthusiasm. They told me they'll get back to me.. never did. Didn't get hired, though I am passionate and interested about it ( I would like to learn/be taught. I have started learning the basics on the internet, diving deeper and deeper into the world of coffee.. reading, watching videos, taking notes, etc., it's just that I wasn't able to show ""off"" my knowledge.

**• My questions are: >** Is it worth applying for a ***McDonalds Barista*** job?  
>Do they train the new employees, or previous experience is required to get hired?  
  
**•** **Bonus question:** Finishing a barista (owning a certificate) course would raise the chance of getting hired?

**Overview**

Novus Roleplay was founded on the premise that the most important part of roleplay was the players' ability to create the character scenes they wanted. We view the job of our community to facilitate a supportive, quality atmosphere for players. Novus is based in the non-lore State of New Malverne, offering El Reno, Prescott Lake, and Alpine Beach.

Our development team has spent thousands of hours remodeling/texturing the GTA V environment for this immersive experience. Our cities are where characters live, laugh and love while crime, despair, and conflict brew just under the surface.

**Planting Your Roots.**

*Create a Story, with Epic roleplays mixed all over.* To help guide character development, Novus RP uses character alignments. Pick from nine different character paths and create the story. Be ready to engage with other stories along the way.

**Live. Work. Play.**

Your character moves to a new city or wakes up to a new morning where they’ve been their entire life. Where do you choose for your character to live? Options await. Each character has a different path that we know you’ve thought a lot about including work. Our player-managed businesses are meant to serve as a base. Player-owned businesses allow you to come up with your new ideas, rent or buy an available shop, and create roleplay opportunities. The character you’ve created has spent their time working hard selling coffee, putting out fires, or maybe slinging drugs. Time to have fun and play in a city full of options.

**No Admission Required.**

*We break down the walls to give you options.* While your character must meet the IC minimums, there are no OOC walls you must leap over to do fun things like start a business, creating a faction or having an idea featured in the server. It is our goal to erase ‘click’ or ‘friend favoritism’ mentalities, leading to a more fair roleplay community.

**Pure Life Economy.**

In-server currency is evenly earned by players both legally or illegally. *No items are spawned in, or obtainable through ‘pay to pay’ patreon subscriptions or donator perks.* We aim to make it fair for all.

**No Lag or Poor Equipment.**

All of Novus Roleplay facilities are hosted on a 100% Dedicated Server with industry-leading components and a fast internet uplink. This means your player data will save and you can expect little to no server lag. We don’t cut corners.

>We believe proper administrative staff can either lead to the growth or demise of a roleplay community. We pledge to administrate fairly and justly, prioritizing the enjoyment of our community members. See the steps we’ve taken for better admins in our bylaws.

Thanks so much at u/Frejaa for being a great exchange partner! I had a lot of fun getting to know you and following your adventures. Sara is a big travel buff and had lots of cool souvenirs, pictures, and updates for me every day.  It was so cool to get updates about where she was that day.

I love that the package included so many things from different places! I'm a bit of a homebody myself, so it was fun to live vicariously through her on her super intense road trip. I got lots of candy, treats, stickers, a handmade mug, books, and of course some perfume!

Special thanks for finally putting some Sorce in my grubby little hands. I enjoy all the samples sent and have fallen in love with the house after putting off trying it for ages. I also got 3 full size perfume oils from Alkemia, Possets, and BPAL which is very generous!

Blood sugar spikes are normal after eating as long as they don’t go over 140 and  stay up? I know better than to eat what  I did but I was curious to see how it would affect me. I’d the goal to completely avoid all blood sugar spikes or not going above the 140? I’m a daily coffee drinker and I have some marshmallow syrup with some lowfat Fairlife milk.

Apologies if this isn't the right place to be posting this, and if not I'd appreciate if someone could tell me where I should. I've been trying to disassemble and restore an antique coffee grinder (similar one attached below) and the handle is seized to the shaft of the grinder pretty good. I tried using WD40 penetrant and Kroil to get it off (not the smartest in retrospect) and it got into the wood of the grinder. Is there anything I can do to make the thing food safe again? Or is it just for display now.

Similarly, I used kroil to loosen a fully rusted bolt on the bottom of an old grill I picked up off the sidewalk, again without thinking. Any way to make it safe to use?
