Nespresso machines aren't working out for me anymore...I'm on my 4th machine in 2 years (They keep breaking from technical issues). I don't mind the espresso that comes from those machines but I like coffee enough that I think it'll be fun to also upgrade my experience. I usually make iced oat lattes in the morning so steaming/frothing isn't a regular occurrence. 

I'm in the United States and in no rush so I'll likely wait until good deals come around Black Friday. I've semi narrowed down my list to Breville since they are abundantly available here and are good looking machines. 

I initially thought I was going to get a Bambino Plus with the Breville Smart Grinder Pro but the Breville sales rep at C&B tried to upsell me to the Express Impress and told me that the grinders built into the machines have gotten better in the current lineup. I feel like the built in scale and auto tamper in the Impress are overkill though, I don't mind getting a scale and spring/weighted tamper separately.  

Does anyone have thoughts on the Bambino Plus vs Express vs Express Impress? Should I consider other options? If I go with the Bambino, are there different recommendations for grinders? ",1,1756757377.0,espresso,0,0.99,False

[USA],"Hi there‚Ä¶ I recently wrote a review about a property we stayed in‚Ä¶ It was beyond decrepit and was advertised as a luxurious mansion. I‚Äôm sure you can see in some of my previous posts how bad it was. It was basically a townhome that needed some major TLC and despite being a newer build, it was WORN. Dirty, fingerprints, and random liquids on all the walls smashed bugs with shoe prints all over the walls‚Ä¶ the front area of house smelled like weed‚Ä¶ Skidmarks in the toilet,trash under the couch and coffee table, baseboards were filthy, and the worst was the extensive water damage through throughout the entire house. Also, there were only two spoons and two bowls in the ‚Äúchef style‚Äù kitchen and no hangers to hang your clothes. I knew within 10 minutes that this place was going to be an issue and I immediately started reaching out to the manager who would just dismiss me and say don‚Äôt worry about that. Enjoy your vacation, blah blah blah. After two nights we decided to leave with two toddlers and two dogs and moved to a much better Airbnb after I showed Airbnb pictures and evidence. I left an honest review because I‚Äôm shocked that this place had five stars in the first place‚Ä¶ It seemed more of a bachelorette party pad with groups of 15 people or more that we‚Äôre probably there for a night or two and didn‚Äôt really care.. I felt generous giving them three stars after our experience but shortly after my review, the host responded with the most scathing review of me and my little family of four. Calling us  despicable and that we were the worst guests ever etc and claiming that I was lying for a refund. The truth is that we weren‚Äôt trying to get a refund on nights we stayed, we just wanted to be able to leave and have the rest of the stay refunded and she refused! We were spending close to 10k on the two week stay and didn‚Äôt want to feel like a hostage in a filthy and hazardous place. We ended up leaving after two nights and spending much more money on a better Airbnb and did get a refund for the future nights and not the ones we did stay. Also having to pack up and move with two toddlers and two dogs in the middle of our vacation was such an inconvenience. Now I have this terrible review even though we were great guests despite  the terrible experience. Should I even bother to get it removed? I think we feel so burned by Airbnb we will most likely never use them again so what does it matter anyways.",1,1756757367.0,AirBnB,1,1.0,False

It was a blistering summer day at the Bennett family's swanky villa.

Kaia Bennett lounged on a sleek leather couch, popping bubblegum with a lazy smirk. Her smooth skin glowed in the sunlight streaming through the window.

With her striking features and effortless grace, she looked like she'd waltzed right out of a fairy tale.

Pop!

Her lips quirked, cheeks puffed, as she blew a bubble the size of her face.

""Kaia's a total loser. I'm done with this engagement!"" Louis stood in the doorway, sneering at her like she was yesterday's trash.

Kaia's mom, Ruth Bennett, freaked out. ""Louis, come on, it's not your fault. Kaia's been a mess‚Äîskipping school, hanging with the wrong crowd.

""But your grandpa and hers set this up. You can't just bail!""

Ruth shot Kaia a look that could kill. ""What're you doing just sitting there? Get over here, apologize to Louis, and promise you'll stop acting like an idiot!""

Snap.

Kaia sucked the bubble back in, cool as ice, and lifted her gaze, lashes fluttering.

A spark of defiance flashed in her gorgeous eyes. ""Me? Say sorry to him? He's the one who should be begging. Breaking his word and talking smack, saying I'm not good enough.""

Ruth's face turned beet red, practically steaming.

Before she could snap, Kaia went on, unfazed. ""And for the record, I'm not out causing trouble. Him? He's chasing every girl in sight, acting like a total player. Good riddance to this engagement‚Äîsaves me from his mess.""

""Kaia!"" Ruth hissed through clenched teeth.

""Forget it,"" Louis cut in, waving her off. ""Kaia's hot, sure, but that's all she's got. I'm not that shallow.

""Even if she begged, I wouldn't marry her. There's only one girl for me.""

His gaze drifted upstairs, all soft and mushy. ""Andrea.""

""Hi, Louis!"" Andrea's voice cracked with emotion as she raced down the stairs.

""Oh, Andrea!"" Louis strode over, arms open wide.

In a flash, they were wrapped in each other's arms, totally lost in the moment.

Andrea's eyes welled up. ""I can't believe it‚Äîwe're finally getting married!""

""I'm so sorry, babe,"" Louis murmured. ""I dragged my feet on calling off the engagement. You shouldn't have had to wait.""

""It's okay,"" she sniffled, clinging to him. ""I get it. You had your reasons. We're good now.""

While the two were lost in their lovey-dovey bubble, Kaia's phone pinged with a text.

It read: \[Dr. Bennett, the project's in its final stretch. For your safety, we've sent an elite team to escort you. We're at the gate. When can you head out?\]

Kaia tapped back: \[On my way.\]

She spit out her gum, tossed it, and made for the door.

Andrea, who'd been side-eyeing Kaia the whole time, smirked to herself.

'Bet she's too embarrassed to stick around,' she thought. 'No way I'm letting her slip out before I twist the knife a little.'

""Kaia, hold up!"" Andrea called, plastering on her best fake-sorry face. ""I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to steal Louis. Yeah, he was your fianc√©, but we're head over heels. I couldn't stop myself! If you're pissed, take it out on me, not him, okay?""

Kaia turned, her face cool and unbothered, like a wisp of smoke. ""What, you auditioning for drama queen of the year? Buzz off.""

Andrea's jaw tightened, but she pushed on. ""Kaia, please don't hate me! If it'll make you feel better, go ahead‚Äîhit me! Whatever it takes to make this right!""

She grabbed Kaia's hand and tried to slap it against her own cheek.

""Whoa, what's your deal, Kaia?"" Ruth, Andrea's mom, stormed over and swatted Kaia's hand away.

Smack!

Kaia glanced at her hand, now stinging red, and went quiet for a second. Then her eyes locked on Ruth.

This was her actual mom, but people'd never guess. Ruth only had heart-eyes for Andrea, the adopted daughter she'd raised, her love so lopsided it was practically in another state.

Andrea fake-sobbed, her eyes red and glistening. ""Mom, it's not her fault. It's mine. I shouldn't have taken her fianc√©. I‚Äî""

""Cut the crap,"" Kaia interrupted, her voice ice-cold. ""You're a pro at playing the victim. Born to steal guys, huh? Can't help it, I guess. It's in your DNA.""

Andrea's face went from red to purple faster than a mood ring on a rollercoaster. She was steaming but bit her tongue to keep up her sweet-girl act.

""Kaia, she's your sister!"" Ruth snapped, her glare full of raw disappointment. ""How can you talk to her like that? That's just vicious!""

Kaia's expression didn't budge‚Äîno anger, no nothing. ""She's not my sister. We're not related.""

Talk about a soap opera twist. Two decades ago, Kaia and Andrea got swapped at birth.

Five years back, the truth came out, and Kaia was dragged from the sticks to the Bennett family's fancy life.

But Ruth, too attached to the daughter she'd raised, kept Andrea around.

And as Kaia's real mom? Ruth didn't lift a finger to make up for lost time. Instead, she treated Kaia like some country-bumpkin burden, while Andrea got all the love.

""How can you say something so cruel?"" Ruth fumed. ""Andrea is my daughter! Blood or no blood, she's family. You pull that talk again, and you'll be sorry!""

Kaia had heard this spiel so many times her ears were calloused. ""I'm swamped. Gotta bounce. Not coming back tonight.""

She turned for the door again.

""Not coming back?"" Ruth's chest heaved like she was about to pop. ""Where are you off to now? Out screwing around again?""

""Not screwing around,"" Kaia shot back, calm as ever.

""Then what is it? Spill it!"" Ruth roared.

Kaia's brows twitched, and she paused for a beat. ""Privlleged information. Can't say.""

Ruth nearly choked on her own rage. By the time she caught her breath, Kaia was already out the door.

""What did I do to get stuck with a daughter like her?"" Ruth wailed, clutching her chest.

Outside the villa, Kaia hit the gate and stopped dead.

A massive convoy of over a hundred military trucks rolled up, engines growling like a thunderstorm.

Above, the whup-whup of a dozen armed choppers sliced the air, kicking up wind.

Kaia glanced up, cool as ever, as the helicopters circled like vultures ready to dive.

Soldiers in sharp camo spilled out of the trucks, snapping into formation and surrounding her in a tight, disciplined ring.

# 2.Chapter 2 This Ride's My Treat

The guy in charge stepped up, dipping his head in a quick bow. ""Dr. Bennett, your chariot awaits.""

""What's with the army?"" Kaia asked, eyeing the crowd.

There wasn't just a ton of them‚Äîthey were all strapped with identical, heavy-duty weapons.

""Dr. Bennett, you're basically a national icon,"" the leader said with a grin. ""Can't let a single scratch ruin the masterpiece. If you didn't hate big scenes, we'd have rolled up with ten times this crew.""

The man, Harry Patterson, stood tall, his gold epaulets with blue trim catching the light.

He looked every bit the badass commander.

""You're full of it,"" Kaia said, rolling her eyes. ""It's just a quick trip to the lab. I'm not gonna get lost in the parking lot. And let's be real‚Äîwith my moves, anyone dumb enough to try me would be eating dirt in seconds.""

""No cap, I'm dead serious!"" Harry's voice crackled with excitement, his eyes practically glowing with hero-worship vibes. ""Your research? It's got the whole world's attention.

""If this thing pops off, it's gonna change the game for humanity. Your safety, your real identity? That's top-secret stuff we'd die to protect.""

Kaia quirked a brow, clearly over the hype. ""Where's Joel at?""

""Mr. Graham's off kicking butt at some global martial arts thing. I've got your back for now.""

""Cool, let's bounce."" Kaia didn't dig deeper and slid into the car.

Back at the Bennett family estate, the butler caught the commotion and hustled outside. He froze, jaw dropping, as Kaia was whisked into a jeep by a pack of camo-clad soldiers.

""Oh, crap! Mrs. Bennett! We've got a problem!"" he yelled, sprinting back inside. ""Miss Kaia Bennett just got nabbed by a swarm of cops!""

""What's going on?"" Ruth's stomach dropped like a rock.

""No idea! Just saw a bunch of cops roll up, surround her, and shove her into a car!""

Ruth bolted out of the villa, Andrea and Louis hot on her tail.

By the time they hit the driveway, the choppers were dots in the sky, and the jeeps were just a trail of dust.

""What‚Äîwhat the hell was that?"" Ruth stammered, clutching her chest, her face white as a sheet.

""Did Kaia do something illegal?"" Andrea threw out, wide-eyed.

""What kind of crime gets that kind of firepower?"" Louis muttered, brow furrowed.

'Murder? A string of murders? Or something totally unhinged?' They were stumped.

\*\*\*\*\*

Two days later, the top lab in Shanghai exploded with cheers and clapping.

""Hell yeah! A whole year of grinding, and we finally nailed it!""

""All thanks to Dr. Bennett. Without her running the show, we'd still be nowhere with this new carbon nanomaterial!""

""No kidding! Once this stuff hits the streets, it's gonna supercharge every industry out there. Total win for the nation!""

""No kidding! Once this stuff hits the streets, it's gonna supercharge every industry out there. Total win for the nation!""

The room was electric, with big-shot professors acting like kids at a candy store, high-fiving and practically breakdancing.

Meanwhile, Kaia, the star of the show, just chilled in the corner, sipping coffee like it was no big deal.

One of the older professors sidled up to her. ""Dr. Bennett, just got a call from the National Research Institute. They wanna know when you're free for a press conference.""

""Eh, whenever works,"" Kaia said with a lazy shrug.

The professor hesitated, not wanting to step on toes. ""So, I can handle the details?""

""Yup."" Kaia's reply was cool as ice.

Relieved, the professor pressed on. ""One more thing‚Äîthis project's got everyone's eyes, even the international research crews are blowing up our inbox.

""They're begging for you to show up in person and own that press conference.""

He held his breath, knowing Kaia liked to keep things low-key.

She paused for a beat, then said, ""Alright, I'm in.""

'Score!' The professor let out a mental cheer, wiping imaginary sweat off his forehead.

He'd been dreading her saying no‚Äînobody wanted to deal with the bigwigs breathing down their necks.

""Cool, I'll get everything ready,"" he said.

""Go for it,"" Kaia said with a casual wave, enjoying her coffee.

Bzzt. Her phone buzzed. Caller ID: Mr. Moreno.

Kaia tapped to answer, but before she could speak, an excited voice blared through. ""Kaia, kid! Heard you ditched that Jiang guy? Congrats, girl!""

Kaia smirked. 'Called it.'

She stayed quiet, waiting for him to get to the point.

""Listen, Kaia, you remember our deal, right?"" Keaton Moreno said. ""If you're single, you give my grandson a chance. Well, you're free now, so it's time to make good on that promise.""

Kaia raised an eyebrow. ""Fine, I'll bite. But what about your grandson? He's Morganburg's hottest bachelor, with women throwing themselves at him left and right. You sure he's down for this?""

""He'll be down, trust me. Oh, and to keep your identity hush-hush, I told him to pick you up by the supermarket near the institute. He's probably there already. I gave him your number, so he'll text when he shows.""

Ding. A text popped up: \[I'm here.\]

Keaton caught the sound through the phone. ""That's him! Get moving, girl, he's waiting to scoop you up!""

""Yeah, yeah,"" Kaia said, unfazed. She tossed a quick wave to the still-hyped professor and headed out of the institute.

Right outside, a slick black Maybach screamed money.

""That car‚Ä¶ looks familiar,"" she muttered.

Three years back, some big-shot overseas tycoon had gifted her one‚Äîonly a handful exist, impossible to buy.

She'd saved his dad's life, and he'd shipped it over as thanks. Not big on driving, she'd passed it to Keaton for his birthday.

As she pieced it together, the driver's window rolled down, revealing a chiseled, handsome face.

""You Kaia?"" that man asked.

""Yup."" She nodded, sizing him up.

The guy sported a loud floral shirt, collar open, rocking a weird-ass necklace. Total player vibes.

'This is Mr. Moreno's grandson? Didn't see that coming,' she thought.

""Hot damn, you're a looker!"" the guy said with a grin, then turned to the backseat. ""Tobias, you hit the jackpot, man. Mr. Moreno knows how to pick 'em.""

Kaia froze. 'Whoops, wrong dude.'

As she reached for the door, a deep, icy voice came from the back. ""Whoever she is, I don't give a damn.""

Kaia kept her face blank and slid into the backseat. That was when she got a good look at Keaton's real grandson‚Äîand for a split second, her breath caught.

She was barely twenty but had traveled the globe, seen more hot guys than she could count.

Few ever made her pause, but this one? He was something else.

Still, she flicked her gaze away quick. Like the guy had said, ""I don't give a damn.""

Not to mention, the dude next to her was glued to his laptop, typing away like his life depended on it. Not a single glance her way. Yeah, he was definitely here under duress.

""Hey, Miss Bennett, realized I didn't introduce myself. I'm Russell Fosher, Tobias's best bro,"" the driver said, tossing her a grin.

""Hey,"" Kaia replied, polite but short.

""No offense, but word is you're twenty and still in high school?"" Russell asked, raising an eyebrow.

""Yup,"" she said, nodding once.

""SAT's coming up, right? You feeling good about it? 'Cause if you're sweating it, I could hook you up. My grandpa's a big-shot professor at Morganburg University‚Ä¶""

Russell kept yammering, but Kaia just stuck to her one-word ""yups.""

'Jeez, she's got that same closed-off vibe as Tobias,' he thought. 'Talk about a tough crowd.'

Bored of the one-sided chat, he let it drop.

Then, out of the blue, Kaia piped up. ""This car‚Äîit was Mr. Moreno's, wasn't it?""

Russell's eyes widened. ""Yeah! How'd you guess?""

Kaia shrugged, all chill. ""Simple. I'm the one who gave it to him.""

At that, Tobias Moreno's head snapped up from his laptop, his eyes darting to the girl beside him.

# 3.Chapter 3 Loose Lips

Kaia's face was a stunner‚Äîdrop-dead gorgeous.

But it wasn't just that. Tobias's cool eyes, usually steady as stone, flickered with something murky.

Her vibe was unreal, like she floated above the rest of the world.

But that wild claim she just dropped made him wince.

""Pfft‚Äî"" Russell cracked up. ""You're killing me! You? Gave Mr. Moreno that car? Best joke I've heard all year!""

""You don't buy it?"" Kaia said, calm as ever, like she was just spitting facts.

Russell thought it was a gag, but her dead-serious face? Like she'd die on that hill. It bugged him.

""You know what car that is? And you're saying you gave it to him?"" he said.

'As if you could afford it.' He didn't say it, but his tone screamed it.

Kaia nodded. ""Limited edition, dropped three years back in Gasha City. Ten made worldwide, right?""

Some big-shot dealer had bragged about it to her once.

Russell's eyes bugged out. 'She knows? And still flexes like she's the one who gifted it? Geez, that's next-level.

'I don't get it‚ÄîKeaton's sharp as a whip, so why pick a show-off like her for his grandson's wife?'

For the Moreno family's sake, Russell zipped it.

The car soon pulled up to the Moreno villa.

""We're here,"" Tobias said, face blank as a brick wall.

""Cool."" Kaia hopped out.

Russell shot Tobias a look as he moved to follow. ""No shade, man, but this girl? Total miss. Mr. Moreno whiffed it.""

Tobias didn't blink. ""Told you, she's got nothing to do with me.""

Seeing Tobias wasn't into her, Russell relaxed.

Keaton was waiting at the entrance, his old eyes lighting up when he saw Kaia. ""Kaia, kiddo! You made it! First time here, huh? My villa's pretty slick, right?""

Kaia glanced inside‚Äîglitzy chandeliers, leather couches, even the tiles screamed cash.

""It's nice,"" she said, short and sweet.

""Nice? Move in! Marry my grandson, pop out a chubby great-grandkid. Nah, one's not enough. Three‚Äîno, five. Scratch that, seven's the vibe.""

Russell clutched his stomach, howling. ""Mr. Moreno, you planning a reboot of The Fantastic Seven? A whole squad of tiny heroes to save their great-grandpa?""

Keaton, too chipper to snap back, grabbed Kaia's hand and tried to pass it to Tobias.

Their hands brushed, and both yanked back like they'd been shocked.

""Grandpa,"" Tobias said, face darkening, ""I picked her up. That's it. I'm not into dating, so drop it.""

""No dating? What, something wrong down there? Or are those rumors true? Always with that Fisher kid‚Äîpeople saying you bat for the other team?"" scolded Keaton.

""Pfft‚Äî"" Russell spewed his water. ""Mr. Moreno, that's just dumb gossip! Total crap!""

""Hmph! Save it. Stay away from my grandson.""

Russell stood there, stunned.

Tobias, seeing Keaton's stubborn streak, doubled down. ""She's not my type.""

""Not your type? How?"" Keaton barked.

Tobias flicked a glance at Kaia, then squared up, voice icy. ""Grandpa, you call me cocky. Fine. But I've earned it. Skipped grades, full ride to Morganburg's top school.

""As CEO, I've crushed it‚Äîtook the company and our family to the top, owned entire markets.""

Keaton's bushy brows knotted. ""So what?""

Tobias's eyes narrowed, stealing another look at Kaia. ""She doesn't cut it. I want someone as exceptional as me.""

""What? Doesn't cut it? Kid, you don't even know who she really is! She's‚Äî""

# 4.Chapter 4 The Engagement

Kaia's foot slammed down on Keaton's, cutting him off mid-sentence.

""What?"" Tobias asked, eyebrow raised.

Russell leaned in, all ears.

Keaton was dying to spill Kaia's secret, but her glare could've stopped traffic.

He coughed. ""Uh, she's my future daughter-in-law, that's who! I picked her myself. You're 27, man, and acting like she's the problem? She's not complaining about you being an old dude chasing young blood, and you're throwing shade? Apologize. Now.""

Tobias's lips thinned as he stood, facing Kaia. ""Sorry if I hurt your feelings, but I'm just being real.""

Kaia popped an orange slice in her mouth, her lazy gaze locking onto him. ""No need. You said what I was thinking. You're solid, but next to me? You're out of your depth. Right back at ya‚Äîyou don't cut it.""

The room went dead quiet.

Tobias's cool eyes flickered, sizing Kaia up with new interest.

Russell, eating up the drama, thought, 'This girl's got guts! Talk about a plot twist.'

""Alright, enough!"" Keaton groaned, half-amused, half-fed-up. ""You two acting like I'm just some old coot to ignore!""

He pointed at Kaia. ""You told me yourself‚Äîwhen I saved you and your family, you'd do whatever I asked. I'm cashing that in.""

Kaia's brows twitched, but she stayed quiet.

""And you,"" Keaton jabbed at Tobias, ""your parents rode you hard to skip chess and join the family biz. If I hadn't backed you, you'd never have played chess or hit those tournaments.

""You swore you'd owe me. Gonna bail now?""

Tobias opened his mouth, then shut it. Checkmate.

The room fell silent, tension thick.

Keaton broke the quiet. ""I'm not forcing a bad match. Here's the deal: get engaged, give it a shot. If it flops, we're done.""

Kaia tilted her head. ""Fine, but I want a deadline.""

""Ten years,"" Keaton said. ""If you're still not clicking, I'll back off.""

Kaia shot him a really? look. ""You're kidding me. Why not fifty?""

Keaton grinned, slapping his thigh. ""Fifty? Done!""

Kaia rolled her eyes. ""You're messing with me.""

""One month,"" she said, voice like ice. ""That's it. Then we're through.""

""A month?"" Keaton yelped. ""That's nothing! Tobias, talk some sense into her!""

Tobias's face didn't budge. ""A month works.""

""Deal,"" Kaia said.

""No take-backs,"" Tobias shot back.

They were weirdly in sync.

Keaton sighed dramatically. ""Fine, you stubborn kids. I'll pick a date for the engagement.""

""Cool,"" Kaia said, checking her phone. She stood. ""It's late. I'm out.""

""Stay for dinner,"" Keaton urged. ""Or crash here.""

""Nah, I've been gone for days. My folks'll have my head.""

Keaton let it go.

As Kaia walked out, Russell muttered, ""Days away? She's a student, right? Doesn't look sick.

""Bet she's just skipping class. Mr. Moreno, you sure about her? She's trouble waiting to happen.""

""You don't know squat!"" Keaton barked, his mustache twitching.

Russell zipped it, not daring to push further.

""Oh, wait!"" Russell perked up, turning to Tobias. ""Big news‚ÄîI tracked down that chess master, Queen K.""

""No way!"" Tobias's stone-cold face lit up, his eyes practically sparkling. ""You're not pulling my leg, right?""

Russell smirked. ""Only chess gets you this pumped. Look at you, acting like a lively twenty-something instead of a grumpy grandpa.""

""Cut the chatter,"" Tobias said. ""When'd you reach her? She down for a match?""

""Didn't talk to her directly,"" Russell said. ""Got someone close to her. She's swamped but they'll pass the message when she's free.""

""Fine,"" Tobias said, fist clenched to hide his excitement. ""I'll wait.""

The Bennett household was quiet until the butler came barreling in, nearly tripping over his own feet.""Ma'am! Miss Bennett‚Äîshe's back!""

""What? She's back?"" Ruth froze mid-bite at the dinner table, her fork hovering as she shot a look at her husband, Lincoln.

The two shared a glance, totally thrown.

Before they could wrap their heads around it, Kaia strutted into the foyer, kicking off her beat-up sneakers and sliding into some comfy slippers.

Ruth dropped her fork with a clatter and hurried over to Kaia.""Hold up‚Äîweren't you dragged off by the cops? How're you back already?

""Oh my God, don't tell me you broke out!""

Ruth's voice cracked at the thought, and Lincoln's face went ashen, his eyes narrowing at Kaia.

""You didn't actually escape, did you?"" he asked, his tone dead serious. ""I'm your dad, Kaia, but I'm not about to cover for you. You gotta turn yourself in. If you don't, I'm calling the cops myself‚Äîfor your own good, kid.""

Kaia just raised an eyebrow, cool as ever. ""Y'all need to chill. I didn't break any laws, and I'm definitely not some fugitive.""

Lincoln's expression hardened. ""You sure you wanna stick with that story?""

Kaia gave a lazy shrug, clearly over the whole drama.

Fed up with her attitude, Lincoln snatched his phone and jabbed at the screen, dialing 9-1-1.

""Hey, yeah, I need to report something,"" he began. ""My daughter got picked up by the police two days ago, and now she's back, acting all sneaky.

""I told her to turn herself in, but she's not listening. I'm reporting her!""

# 5.Chapter 5 Boxing

""Name?"" the operator asked. Lincoln gave the operator her name. ""Kaia Bennett. K-A-I-A.""

""Hold on, let me check the records,"" the voice on the line said.

A minute later, the operator's voice came back, tripping over itself. ""Uh, sir, you're way off. Kaia hasn't broken any laws, and she sure as hell didn't bust out of jail!

""Pull this again, and we'll hit you with a fine for wasting our time.""

Click. The line went dead.

Lincoln stood there, dumbfounded. Ruth, right next to him, had heard every word crystal clear.

Kaia, cool as ever, started for the stairs. ""If that's it, I'm out.""

Ruth watched her daughter's solitary figure, a twinge of guilt softening her scowl.

Kaia was her kid, her own flesh and blood. No matter how much she messed up, that bond wasn't going anywhere.

""Kaia, sweetie, I'm sorry,"" Ruth said, her voice softer than usual. ""I shouldn't have jumped down your throat.""

Kaia paused mid-step, a sting hitting her chest. She turned, locking eyes with her mom.

Lincoln let out a heavy sigh. ""Look, kiddo, I was just freaked out, thinking you'd gotten into some serious trouble. I screwed up. Sorry.""

Kaia's brows knit together. ""You don't need to make a big deal out of it.""

The living room went quiet, the air thick with tension. Kaia broke the silence first. ""I'm hitting the sack.""

""Hang on,"" Ruth called. ""What went down that day? Why'd a swarm of cops show up and drag you off?""

""I already told you, Mom. It's classified. I can't spill now, but I'll fill you in when I can.""

Ruth's patience evaporated, her eyes burning with frustration and disappointment.

She didn't want to keep butting heads, so she pivoted. ""Your teacher called this morning. Said if you keep ditching class, you're out of that school.""

""I'll deal with it,"" Kaia said with a shrug, like it was no sweat.

She knew she could pull a few strings to smooth things over.

Ruth's temper flared. ""Deal with it? How? You're not running the place, Kaia! You're twenty!

""If you hadn't skipped so much school‚Äîor taken that whole year off‚Äîyou wouldn't still be stuck in high school.

""Look at Andrea. Same birthday as you, and she's killing it as a sophomore at Morganburg University. Two years ahead!

""If you keep slacking, you think you're getting into college? You'll end up at some rinky-dink school people laugh at!""

Kaia had tried explaining why she took that year off before, but her parents never bought it.

They'd ripped into her, saying she was spinning tall tales. So now? She didn't bother. Believe what they wanted.

""Don't stress,"" Kaia said, her voice steady. ""I'm not gonna be a joke, and I'm not going to some shady college. I'm shooting for Morganburg University.""

Ruth's jaw hit the floor. ""Morganburg University? You're kidding, right?""

Kaia gave a small, confident nod. ""Nope.""

""That's the best school in the city! Only the cream of the crop gets in. Andrea practically lived in her textbooks to make it, studying 24/7.

""You, with all your absences and two years behind? You really think you've got a shot?""

""I'm pretty sure I can nail the city's top exam score,"" Kaia said, not a hint of doubt in her voice.

Ruth nearly choked on her own breath. By the time she pulled herself together, Kaia was already in her room.

Wiped out from two days of hardcore research, Kaia was about to hop in the shower when her phone lit up with a video call from a buddy.

A good-looking guy popped up on the screen, grinning wide.

""Yo, Queen K!"" he said. ""Big news. King T's throwing down the gauntlet. Wants to face off with you in a mess match. Winner takes all.""

Kaia's eyes lit up. ""King T? No way, for real?""

""Cross my heart.""

""Count me in.""

""Hell yeah!"" Owen Webb was practically vibrating with excitement. ""Queen K versus King T? That's like the World Series of Chess! The whole scene's gonna lose their minds. I'm so pumped! I'll tell him you're down.""

""Sweet,"" Kaia said with a nod.

Call done, she took a quick, steaming shower and crawled into bed, ready to crash hard.

\*\*\*\*\*

At six a.m. sharp, Kaia threw on her workout clothes and headed out the door.

It'd been forever since her last morning session, and today, she was pumped to hit the park for some boxing practice.

When she rolled up, she saw an old guy in a tracksuit throwing punches, surrounded by a bunch of other old-timers cheering like it was a prizefight.

""Way to go, Mr. Crawford! You're crushing it!""

I brought home flowers for no reason- peonies (her favorite) and didn‚Äôt care. I scheduled a babysitter, reservation at her favorite restaurant, and a night at a fancy hotel. Told her to just grab what makeup/bathroom items she wanted because we would be shopping for a new dress and shoes for dinner, and something comfortable for the next day. She rolled her eyes and said she didn‚Äôt have time for that. I was tired of being the only one who tried. 

We had been married for twelve years. The first six had been decent. The last six, not so much. What started as quiet discontent had evolved into a numb, daily endurance test‚Äîher passive digs, the emotional distance, the lifeless conversations. They weren‚Äôt yelling matches. They were worse: nothingness. Each day felt like a gray, suffocating fog that dulled everything.
My friends had mostly drifted away, tired of my half-hearted excuses about her interest in ever leaving the house or doing anything fun. 
My world had grown small. Predictable. Tiring. 

And then came the club.

It started innocently enough. One night, I stumbled upon something in Reddit‚Äî‚ÄúMarried but Lonely?‚Äù‚Äîand clicked out of sheer curiosity. The stories there sounded eerily familiar: men and women trapped in the same quiet desperation. No drama, no scandal, just a craving for connection. The ad said DM for info.

By the end of the evening I had worked up the nerve and created a username.
It didn‚Äôt take long for someone to invite me to a private screening room where they talked about how privacy (OPSEC) is suuuper important and quizzed me on my practices. Even suggested some new ways to stay safe that I‚Äôd not heard of. After I passed the screening process I was invited into a lovely space. Everyone greeted me and I felt like a shiny penny! People who actually cared what I thought, and what I liked. It wasn‚Äôt sleazy. It wasn‚Äôt about cheating. Not really. Just a dimly lit corner of the internet where people flirted, vented, laughed. Called each other gorgeous. For the first time a compliment I paid a woman was met with enthusiasm.

By the end of the week, I had private messages buzzing with others like me! The flirting and women who actually were kind and thoughtful. Beautiful women who reciprocated my flirting and appreciated it. 

There was one woman who really stood out, pretty in an unconventional way. I couldn‚Äôt stop staring at her photo. We flirted constantly in the group, and even heavier in DMs. There were voice notes and then voice calls. I was enamored. For once, in a long time, I was spending time with a woman who appreciated all of the attention I showed her.

Sitting at my desk tonight, I feel both grateful and relieved. If someone had told me two months ago that I‚Äôd be running my own office, managing my own clients, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have believed them.

Leaving my job at a mid-sized CPA firm after just eight months was one of the hardest choices I‚Äôve ever made. Most dad thought I was making a mistake. There were nights when I questioned if I had taken on too much too early.

But I wanted to build something of my own. Now that the first month is behind me, I thought I‚Äôd share how things went, what I earned, and what I‚Äôve learned so far.

**Location**

I opened my office in North Lamar, Austin, and honestly, it turned out to be the right call. The area is buzzing with startups, IT firms, and professionals who need tax planning, filings, and compliance help. Because of the location, I got a steady flow of walk-ins, and referrals started coming in sooner than I expected.

**First Month‚Äôs Earnings**

**Clients handled:** 28 total (walk-ins, referrals, and tie-ups combined)

|Service|Revenue|
|:-|:-|
|Consultation fees|$1,650|
|Federal & state tax filings|$1,200|
|Business tax advisory *(2 startups)*|$1,500|
|**Gross Revenue**|**$4,350**|

**Monthly Expenses**

|Expense|Amount|
|:-|:-|
|Staff salary (1 junior + receptionist)|$1,600|
|Office rent (North Lamar)|$1,050|
|Utilities & Internet|$180|
|Printing & stationery|$90|
|Software subscriptions|$120|
|**Net Revenue**|**$1,310**|

$1,310 might not sound huge, but for me, it's a great start. More than the money, it‚Äôs the systems I‚Äôve built and the lessons I‚Äôve learned that matter most.

**Key Learnings So Far**

**1. Time Matters More Than Revenue**

The income this month feels good, but the real gain is the time saved. Better systems let me focus on tax planning, compliance strategies, and deeper client relationships instead of drowning in manual work.

For example, I started using a [PDF tool](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xpfd8khrlntj9v?hl=fr-FR&gl=FR) because almost every client sends me W-2s, 1099s, invoices, and returns in PDF form.

Earlier, I used different PDF tools for each task and spent hours editing, merging, and organizing files manually. Now, the tool saves me 6-7 hours every week, reduces my staffing needs, and frees me up for more consultations and client strategy work.

**2. Automate Wherever You Can**

The first week was chaos. Scanned statements, invoices, and tax docs were everywhere. I worked late every night and still couldn‚Äôt keep up. That‚Äôs when I understood the real value of automation:

I set up:

* **Automated tax filing reminders** via Google Calendar integrated with my CRM, so clients get notified ahead of deadlines.
* **Pre-drafted email templates** for common queries, which save hours every week.
* **Delegation of repetitive work** like invoice sorting and basic data entry to my junior.

These changes alone improved my productivity by nearly 30 to 35 percent and gave me room to handle more clients efficiently.

**3. Trust Builds Business**

Some of my old clients from the CPA firm where I worked reached out this month, and a few decided to continue with my services. That trust means everything to me. Two of them even referred me to startup founders, which led to my first business tax advisory tie-ups. Referrals are proof that good work brings more clients without even asking for it.

**4. Client Education Builds Long-Term Relationships**

Many small business owners don‚Äôt fully understand tax laws or compliance timelines. Instead of just doing the work, I started explaining the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù during tax planning consultations. When clients understand what‚Äôs happening with their money, they value your work more and stick around longer. It also makes them more likely to refer you to others.

**5. Networking Brings Clients**

A few clients came through referrals, but others came simply because I took the time to connect with local startups and small business owners around North Lamar. A quick coffee chat or a casual introduction often turns into a consultation, and sometimes that leads to recurring work. In this line of work, people hire people they know and trust.

**6. Stay Updated, Stay Relevant**

Tax laws change constantly in the US, both at the federal and state levels. Missing updates can cost clients money and hurt your credibility. I‚Äôve started dedicating at least 30-minutes daily to reading IRS updates, state notifications, and recent tax case rulings. Clients notice when you‚Äôre informed, and it builds confidence in your services.

**Mistakes**

* I **underpriced a few services early on**, thinking I‚Äôd attract more clients. It taught me to value my time and expertise properly.
* I **tried to handle everything myself** in the first week. That caused burnout and delays. Delegate work whenever you can.
* I **didn‚Äôt track recurring clients** properly at first, which meant missed upsell opportunities. Now, I keep a simple CRM to track every client interaction.

These mistakes were small but important lessons that I‚Äôll carry forward.

**A Personal Moment**

Last weekend, my dad came to visit the office. He walked around quietly, taking it all in. I showed him my first month‚Äôs earnings report. He stood silently for a moment and then smiled.

That one smile, after months of doubt, meant more to me than the $1,310 I earned this month.

1n5z46b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n5z46b,"JAKUB SCHIKANEDER ‚Äê A STREET IN WINTER, 1905","The artist captures a moment in Prague that feels both fleeting and eternal. The sky above is a deep, inky blue, with the promise of more snow. The street is covered in a soft blanket of white, untouched save for a few faint footprints that trail off into the distance, as if someone wandered through and vanished into the night. A solitary figure stands near the edge of the scene, a woman, her back to us, her form concealed in a dark coat. She is alone, her posture hinting at a probable moment of contemplation, or perhaps hesitation before continuing her journey. Is she waiting for someone? Or is she simply lost in thought? Schikaneder does not tell us her story. We only wonder. The snow muffles all sound, and the silence is almost palpable, broken only by the imagined crunch of her boots.

Schikaneder‚Äôs style is rooted in late 19th- and early 20th-century realism, but it leans heavily into a moody, almost impressionistic evocation of atmosphere, which sets him apart from purely documentary painters. In this piece, his brushwork is deliberate yet soft, rendering the snow with a textured, almost tactile quality, and the buildings with a weathered authenticity. This realism grounds the scene in the everyday life of Prague‚Äôs working-class neighborhoods. His style feels deeply tied to the soulful, reflective spirit of Czech art and literature from his era, echoing the works of writers like Karel ƒåapek and poets like Otokar B≈ôezina. Their stories and verses often wove concepts of solitude and a quiet search for meaning, and you can sense that same mood in his painting, like a shared heartbeat of the time.

What‚Äôs really special is that Schikaneder was part of a lively group of artists, writers, and musicians who gathered at the Caf√© Slavia, a beloved spot just across from the National Theatre. Back then, this caf√© was like a second home for creative minds, a place where they‚Äôd sit for hours, sipping coffee and diving into conversations about art, politics, and what it meant to be Czech in the shadow of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Schikaneder, quiet but always watching, soaked up these talks, his mind buzzing with ideas about freedom and identity. You can feel that same spirit here. The painting‚Äôs quiet, heartfelt mood captures the hope and heaviness of those late-night chats. Being part of the Caf√© Slavia crowd gave Schikaneder‚Äôs work a deeper soul, as if he wasn‚Äôt just painting a street but the heart of a city longing to be heard.",6,1756756930.0,ArtConnoisseur,0,1.0,False
1n5z42x,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrEricBergDC/comments/1n5z42x/how_diet_and_nutrition_may_impact_adhd/,How Diet and Nutrition May Impact ADHD,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsive behaviors that typically begin in childhood and persist into adulthood.

While more research is needed, it appears that certain food additives, nutritional deficiencies, and a high-carb or ultra-processed diet may exacerbate ADHD symptoms.

Learn about common ADHD symptoms and their potential connection to diet and discover key ADHD nutrition tips to support healthy neurological development and brain function.

# What is ADHD?

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition that usually begins affecting children between the ages of 3 and 6 and often persists into adulthood.¬†

This common disorder is characterized by frequent behaviors that disrupt daily life, making it challenging to maintain relationships or focus on certain tasks. This can lead to poor performance in various settings, such as school or the workplace.

There are three recognized types of ADHD:¬†

* Inattentive ADHD
* Hyperactive-impulsive ADHD
* Combined presentation ADHD



Inattentive ADHD involves difficulties focusing or staying on task with no obvious impulsive or hyperactive behavior.

Those diagnosed with hyperactive-impulsive ADHD may find paying attention less challenging. However, those affected often talk excessively, have trouble sitting still, and intrude on activities or conversations inappropriately.

Combined presentation ADHD is the most common diagnosis, with symptoms of both hyperactivity and inattentiveness.¬†

Watch the video below to learn more about the link between nutritional deficiencies and ADHD.

# Symptoms of ADHD

ADHD symptoms are defined as a pattern of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsive behaviors.¬†

Common signs of ADHD include:

* Aggression
* Moving at inappropriate times
* Feeling restless or fidgety¬†
* Difficulty paying attention or staying on task
* Interrupting others¬†
* Excessive chatter¬†
* [Mood swings](https://www.drberg.com/blog/ketones-and-emotions-depression-anxiety-irritability)
* Low frustration tolerance
* Poor time management
* Disorganization
* Forgetfulness¬†
* Careless or dangerous risk-taking

Symptoms can range from mild to severe and may affect children and adults differently, change, or partially alleviate as a person ages.¬†

If you‚Äôre concerned that you or your child may have ADHD, contact your healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.

# Can nutrition impact ADHD symptoms?

Yes, dietary habits influence overall health, including brain health and central nervous system functions. Poor nutrition could affect ADHD symptom severity and inhibit healthy neurodevelopment and neurological function.¬†

Deficiencies in specific nutrients, such as B vitamins, iron, magnesium, and zinc, may worsen hyperactivity and inattention due to their roles in neurotransmitter synthesis and metabolism.

Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that transport messages across brain cells and play a crucial role in regulating several bodily functions, including memory, learning, attention, and mood.

Unhealthy diets are linked to worsening ADHD symptoms. In contrast, healthy dietary patterns, such as those rich in vegetables, berries, healthy fats, and high-quality protein, are positively associated with better brain health.¬†

A study published in¬†*Nutrients*¬†concluded,¬†*‚Äú‚Ä¶dietary patterns appear to play a significant role in the risk of developing or aggravating disease symptoms. Altered levels of nutrients, such as vitamin D, iron, zinc, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, have also been associated with the aggravation and progression of ADHD.‚Äù*[^(1)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/adhd-is-a-nutritional-problem-not-a-mental-one#3050d639-0abc-4a3a-8551-5539ec61974c)

While some evidence suggests a connection between diet and this neurodevelopmental disorder, it‚Äôs important to consult your doctor before stopping ADHD medication or making significant lifestyle changes.

# 8 ADHD nutrition tips

More than 40 essential nutrients cannot be synthesized by the body in sufficient quantities, which means they must be obtained from the diet.¬†

Adopting a nutrient-dense diet is vital for supporting nervous system development and brain function, and certain nutrients may be especially beneficial for individuals with ADHD symptoms.

Here are eight ADHD diet tips to support neurological functions.

# 1. Regularly consume fatty fish

Fatty fish, such as salmon, tuna, and sardines, are rich sources of¬†[omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/basics-of-omega-3-fatty-acids), a group of health-promoting polyunsaturated fats crucial for optimal nerve and brain function.¬†

Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a type of omega-3 fat, is strongly linked to brain health and makes up about 25 percent of the brain‚Äôs total gray matter. This gray matter is essential for memory, emotional regulation, and cognitive function.

A¬†[study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4170184/)¬†published in¬†*Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America*¬†highlights the potential benefits of omega-3 fatty acids in supporting focus, attention, and overall brain health in children with ADHD.[^(2)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/adhd-is-a-nutritional-problem-not-a-mental-one#7eaa5ea1-adc3-41c8-b304-5a72c4cb3945)

# 2. Prioritize vitamin B-rich foods

Individuals with ADHD often display B vitamin deficiencies, particularly in vitamins B2, B6, and B9, all of which are vital nutrients for neuronal health.

Evidence published in¬†*The British Journal of Psychiatry*¬†suggests that B vitamins may support ADHD symptom management by helping regulate the production of serotonin, dopamine, and other key neurotransmitters.[^(3)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/adhd-is-a-nutritional-problem-not-a-mental-one#9a17618f-2363-4d44-bf56-5e5f0d45486b)

Nutritional yeast, pork, pasture-raised poultry, wild-caught fish, eggs, avocado, and leafy green vegetables are essential ADHD brain function foods, as they are rich in B vitamin complex nutrients.¬†

# 3. Enjoy caffeine in moderation

While their effects can vary, caffeinated beverages, such as¬†[black coffee](https://www.drberg.com/blog/health-benefits-black-coffee)¬†and tea, may help increase attention, learning, and memory in adults with ADHD.¬†

This is likely due to its ability to boost dopamine and norepinephrine, two key neurotransmitters that regulate motivation, attention, and focus, similarly to stimulant medications often used in ADHD treatment.

However, it‚Äôs recommended to consume caffeine in moderation. Daily intake over 400 milligrams (mg) can worsen symptoms, such as anxiety, restlessness, irritability, and difficulty focusing, in those with ADHD.

# 4. Consider an elimination diet

An elimination diet is a short-term approach to identify food sensitivities and reduce gut inflammation. It involves removing common allergens from the diet and gradually reintroducing them to observe any reactions.¬†

Foods typically eliminated include:

* Dairy
* Soy
* Wheat
* Eggs
* Peanuts
* Seafood

Identifying and avoiding trigger foods can support gut health, reduce neuroinflammation, and positively influence brain function. This connection between the digestive system and the brain is known as the gut-brain axis.

The gut-brain axis allows the brain and gut to communicate and influence bidirectional functions, including digestion, mood, and mental health, which may influence ADHD severity.

# 5. Avoid sugar and refined carbohydrates

There may be a link between diets high in refined carbohydrates, such as bread, pasta, and cereals, as well as sugary foods, and ADHD symptom severity.¬†

This is likely due to the impact these foods have on blood glucose, leading to rapid spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels.

When the brain relies on glucose as a primary fuel source, fluctuations in blood sugar balance can quickly lead to mood instability and difficulties focusing, two hallmarks of ADHD. Increased hyperactivity has also been associated with higher dietary sugar intake.

Additionally, sugar and refined carbohydrates may deplete B vitamins, which are essential nutrients for optimal neurological development and performance.

# 6. Focus on minimally processed whole foods

Nutritious whole foods, such as wild-caught or grass-fed meat, organic vegetables, low-carb fruits, and full-fat dairy, are rich sources of essential vitamins and minerals that support brain and overall health.¬†

Individuals with ADHD are often deficient in a wide range of nutrients, including iron, zinc, and magnesium, which are found in various animal and plant foods.¬†

Additionally, consuming foods rich in minerals and the amino acid L-tyrosine promotes dopamine release and may help maintain normal brain function.¬†

*‚ÄúL-tyrosine is a precursor to dopamine found in meat, eggs, cheese, and fish,‚Äù*¬†explains Dr. Berg.¬†*‚ÄúA boost in dopamine can greatly improve focus, particularly in children consuming a high-carb, ultra-processed diet.‚Äù*

In addition, non-starchy vegetables and berries offer potent antioxidants. These natural compounds can enhance the body‚Äôs ability to protect the brain from free radical damage and oxidative stress, which are believed to be contributing factors to the development of ADHD and other neurological conditions.¬†

# 7. Promote optimal vitamin D levels¬†

[Vitamin D](https://www.drberg.com/blog/vitamin-d3-5000-iu-benefits-health-benefits-risks-explained)¬†is involved in several biological processes involving the central nervous system, which directly impact brain function and neurotransmitter activity.¬†

Vitamin D plays a key role in regulating dopamine levels, a neurotransmitter often found to be low in individuals with ADHD.

Research published in¬†*BMC Pediatrics*¬†suggests a potential role of vitamin D in supporting emotional balance, behavior regulation, and social functioning in children with ADHD.[^(4)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/adhd-is-a-nutritional-problem-not-a-mental-one#c6be21aa-bd6a-4812-b83e-30b84497089f)

Maintaining healthy vitamin D levels through regular sunlight exposure and vitamin D-rich foods such as egg yolks, beef liver, salmon, and tuna may support overall well-being in individuals with ADHD.

# 8. Avoid artificial dyes and preservatives

Research suggests that artificial food colorings and preservatives may be associated with worsening ADHD symptoms, potentially by affecting neurotransmitter function or contributing to neuroinflammation.

A study published in¬†*Nutritional Neuroscience*¬†confirms this and reports that artificial food coloring exposure can affect brainwave activity and symptom severity in those with ADHD.[^(5)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/adhd-is-a-nutritional-problem-not-a-mental-one#b27892e0-1ef3-41cc-96fe-4cdd67333857)",1,1756756923.0,DrEricBergDC,0,1.0,False

1n5z3p3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cafe/comments/1n5z3p3/caferestaurant_bottlenecks/,Cafe/Restaurant  Bottlenecks,"So, i got quite a few questions from my last post. I am indeed building a SaaS product for cafes/restaurants. Upon research i've found that a number of people are having issues with:

\* Disjointed Operations. Juggling multiple tools for rota management, stock management, and staff training, leading to inefficiencies.

\* High staff turnover & training gaps. Constantly training new staff

\* Unreliable Marketing & Customer Retention. Need help with consistent marketing.

\* Tracking Wastage can often be quite difficult, and what is running low.

\* Stuck working in the business is the biggest pain point.

So i've set out to tackle these issues being a coffee shop owner for over 10 years myself. Personally supply chain issues has been a real bottleneck. Because of being so busy working IN the business i would lose track of ordering the basics like coffee, milk, cups, serviettes etc. 

Are there any businesses that have any bottlenecks in their coffee/restaurant business? ",1,1756756898.0,cafe,0,1.0,False
1n5z3bi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1n5z3bi/my_moms_behaviour_is_very_concerning/,My mom‚Äôs behaviour is very concerning.,"I‚Äôm 17 and my mom (63) is becoming very forgetful. In a drive thru the barista held out her drink for her to grab it, she kept talking to me and ignored him even though I repeatedly told her to turn around and grab her drink. She constantly drives into curbs and swerves wildly, simply saying ‚Äúoops‚Äù when I tell her she needs to pay attention. She will leave Facebook reels playing full volume on loop and not even realize she hasn‚Äôt turned her phone off.

We do fitness classes together as a work at a gym. I told her after class that she should lose the Pilates block when doing lunges so she can focus on balance and get the full range of movement to help her muscles grow and prevent injury. She got terribly mad at me and yelled how cruel I was and how I hurt her feelings. She said she had been ‚Äúslaying‚Äù all of her classes and now she feels like an idiot over me just correcting her form. She has always taken critique awful but in recent years even worse. She talks long and often about how strong and fit she is, even though she is not. I‚Äôve seen her in classes and she cannot complete any of the movements properly. When we come out of a class, I‚Äôll remark that it was difficult and she says how easy it was for her because of how very fit she is. 

In the winter we got in a fight where she threw her coffee on me and kicked me out of her car miles away from home, claiming she hated me. I jogged 7 km to my work and just sat in the office crying because I didn‚Äôt want to go home. Eventually she came and got me, saying I was being dramatic. The next day I told her I was upset because she said she hated me over a petty argument which started when I told her she pulled up to far at the Starbucks drive through  and misses the order screen. She just left the house and ignored me completely. She always leaves or tells me to leave at any whiff of conflict. 

I‚Äôve been dating my boyfriend for almost a year now, he is lovely and we have had a happy relationship this far. My mom is obsessed with him even though they have barely had a full conversation, she always tells me how much she loves him, how good a boy he is. Her background on her phone is a picture of my boyfriend at prom with me but I am cropped from the photo. She makes breakfast in bed for us but only when he sleeps over. She asks him often for favours such as borrowing his truck or having him walk the dogs with her while I‚Äôm at work. 

She is obsessed with being young, she gets Botox and fillers and is on ozempic but still manages to out eat it. She has criticized by body many times, telling me I eat too much or I‚Äôm getting big even though I‚Äôm at a very healthy weight and at times have been severely underweight. I exercise five days a week and eat balanced meals. She always asks me about the girls I work with ‚ÄúWho is the super skinny girl you work with? The short one? She is so tiny and so beautiful.‚Äù I laugh and awkwardly say I must be fat as she never talks about me like that. She says ‚ÄúYou did eat your breakfast really fast‚Ä¶‚Äù it‚Äôs always something along those lines. She wants to get cool sculpting and I‚Äôve told her it‚Äôs stupid and it‚Äôs a bit frightening that she is obsessed with looking like a twenty year old. She just went silent. 

As I sit to write this she has just said ‚ÄúI thought you were going for a run. You could use one.‚Äù 

I hate living with her so very much. It has caused me endless distress and my brother as well. She was an awful parent to us as she never really wanted children. As a woman I feel really sorry for her but as a mother she has failed me immensely. The catalyst for our most recent argument was yesterday. I was looking through my Snapchat memories with my brother (he is visiting for the week), he comments on how sad I looked on my birthday. I answered that I was sad and I cried so hard that night I threw up. My mom scoffs and says ‚ÄúNot as hard as I cried this morning.‚Äù 
I ask what wrong and she is still bent up about me correcting her form. Usually I can stay pretty calm when we fight but I lost it.
‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm pretty sure I cried a whole lot harder than you.‚Äù I said. 
Then she has the audacity to say ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre making it a competition now?‚Äù Like what wasn‚Äôt her intention with her initial comment. I got so upset I began to sob and told her I spent the entire summer depressed and harming myself, that she knew and she didn‚Äôt care. When there was blood all over the bathroom because I had cut. She told me to stop being sad because my boyfriend would want to break up with me. 
I brought up every time she has made mine and my brothers suffering about her. She raises her hand and says ‚ÄúBye. Leave.‚Äù Repeatedly until I do. 

Currently I am working and saving to move out as soon as I graduate. It‚Äôs impossible to live with her. My whole life she has never had an ounce of sympathy for me and less and less the older I become. My boyfriend has offered for me to live with him many times but I turn him down as I don‚Äôt want to be a burden on his family. My goal is to be self sufficient so I will never have to rely on anyone again. My mom is always talking about how big of narcissists my dad and my brother are but she is the biggest of them all, so far up her own ass she can‚Äôt see what she does wrong. I forgot to mention my parents are divorced, my dad is an alcoholic and doesn‚Äôt have a steady place to live. My brother is in between jobs and living  with his girlfriend‚Äôs family. I‚Äôm just frustrated is all since I‚Äôve lived with my biggest bully my whole life. One day I will put her in a home and never have to see her again.

1n5z26q,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1n5z26q/sf_the_corridors/,[SF] The corridors,"I only have a fragment of mirror left, I have been away from my Hall for too long. All my mirrors gone, broken, lost, bartered. I extend this last one, carefully, on the rod I recovered from the lintel of 12B, the Middle Door of the corridor I have walked. I have not yet pushed the fragment past the corner to peek into the new corridor, when I hear a noise. I pull my hand back as if I had burned it and slip the precious fragment into the sheath on my chest.

Something rolling. Not the fragmented roll of a grenade, a Pineapple, but the smooth rolling of a marble. Small. Light. I step back quickly, on the edge of my bare feet, silent, the right hand with a Beretta aimed at the turn, the left hand with the sister Beretta backwards, because sometimes the Middle Door connects with the corridor behind the corner. Unknown geometries, I am a stranger, I cannot explore every branch. I lie down and stretch in the corner formed by wall and floor, waiting for what is rolling to appear. As soon as I see it, a little shiny steel ball, I shut my eyes and press my face on my arm.

It is a flash-bang. I hear it hit the wall, coming toward me, then it detonates with what is a thud and a hiss at the same time. I see the flash even through my arm. I raise my head and reopen my eyes, because now they are coming. I sing my mantra, I empty my mind. It is only one, who turns the corner on foot, flattened against the wall, to offer less surface. But he is slower than me, and my position offers him an unusual firing angle, which leaves him puzzled, and then dead. I see a thread of smoke from the slide of the right Beretta and it is as if I do not remember having fired. If you remember, you thought about it, and if you thought about it you are dead. He is folded on the ground, I wait. Hearing fucked by the shots, I wait. When I am sure enough he was alone, I move.

I start running, jump the body and turn. The new corridor is empty now, as I sensed, I am pressed against the left wall. I deal with the dead. I lay him on his back. He is young, he has only two ritual scars on the left arm, the last one still has reddened edges. He has two .45 Sig Sauers, the grip plates remade in transparent plastic carved with his clan‚Äôs patterns. A real gigolo. Two grenades and a Claymore on his back. Too young, too accessorized.

He has two entry holes under the right armpit, I stick the index finger that shot into the lower hole, the first one, and say the prayer of the dead. This ceremony has always embarrassed me. I find it too sensual. Then I cut a strip of muscle from his right leg and chew it for a long time.

When I have finished with the rites, I hoist him on my shoulder and go back to the Middle Door. I enter the Round Hall and put him down. I blindfold his eyes with two pieces of his mirrors on top, lift the grate in the center of the floor and slide him into the Pit with his weapons. I reload the right Beretta with two cartridges, then I set off for the new corridor.


---

I reach the first door on the right, place my mirror on the plate and open it. It is a short corridor, only four doors. I open the first on the right. I enter a large round hall, without a central Pit. I am lucky, it is a Storage Hall. It is surrounded by doors, between one and another vending machines of food and drinks. On the vending machines there are the seals of a Hall. I tear them off, my mirror has Unlimited Access. I drink three coffees and eat a hamburger. Then I sit cross-legged in the center of the hall and clean my teeth with my toothbrush. I am terrified of toothache, of mouths tormented and ruined by cavities. I must add a scar to my left arm, but this is not the right time and place. The possibilities are equal, I will now enter the Storage I face. I get up and reach the door. I open, I enter the tunnel of the Track. The arrival station is empty, I will have to wait for the wagon. I look around, the station is fairly clean, except for the remains of a fire in a corner, and bones. Beasts. I go to the large plate on the poles at the side of the access gate. I activate it with the mirror. It tells me the next wagon arrives in seventeen minutes. I have time to evacuate. I go to the toilets. I enter cautiously, because I sense the smell of the Beasts. The light panels do not turn on at my entrance. Only one, in a corner. The steel urinals are full of unidentifiable remains, I relieve myself in one of the stalls, more or less free, luckily the water still runs.

It gives me chills to put my feet on this floor.

I return to the platform to wait for the wagon. I hide behind the bumper plate, there could be passengers. I feel a draft of air, it is coming. There is no noise, only wind and pressure in the ears. When I feel the plate vibrate, I understand it has arrived. The hydraulic doors open, but no one seems to get off. After a while I take a quick look, the station is empty.

The wagon is empty and spotless, as always, like the corridors and storages, dirt never sticks to their surfaces. It seems to stand out sharp against the grayness of the station, because it is shiny, chromed, clean.

I enter, go to the end that will become the nose and wait. When it starts, it does so without any noise, without vibrations. The journey lasts seven minutes, even the arrival station is empty. I get off, go to the door and I am in the storage. Shelves ten meters high, shelves of variable height, depending on the stored goods. Infinite rows, ahead and to the sides. The shelves of the first rows are empty, the floor disappears under layers of cardboard, cloth, carpets and packaging material. I set out along the avenue between the shelves in front of me. It is wide, the ceiling is at least another ten meters above the top of the shelves, from the metal trusses in the darkness hang the light panels.

As I walk, the layer covering the floor decreases and some boxes begin to appear on the shelves. Every ten shelves there is an opening to change aisle. I move eight aisles to the right and continue forward. I must hurry, because night is coming and I must move away from the entrances, because the beasts never go deep inside. I keep a light run, from time to time I move another eight aisles to the right, eight is the number I have chosen for this night. At a certain point I find a pallet jack, I start it and run along the shelves without deviating to the right anymore, I try to go as deep as possible into the storage. When I think I am deep enough I stop and consult the mirror. I have twelve minutes left before night. I climb the shelf to my right, climb to the top and settle on the boxes. I open some until I find a fabric. The others contain glass tubes of various sizes embedded in gray shavings. I wait for the night facing the depths of the storage. It comes as a black line widening between the shelves. The line spreads more and more, until it is upon me and passes me, heading towards the entrances. It is the light panels turning off in sequence, except the one of my shelf, which detects the presence of someone and stays on.

If I moved, the island of light would follow me.

I stay for a while staring at the darkness of the center. Behind, towards the entrances, there are other islands of light like mine. They are few and scattered, mine is the only one so deep. Some bigger ones move, some beast hunting. Tomorrow I will hunt too. In the silence, I listen to the depths of the storage, the voices of the dark. At the edge of the inaudible there is something, always, sometimes I convince myself it is the noise of my blood, sometimes it seems to approach, and my palms sweat.

It is time to honor the young warrior I killed a few hours ago. I make a cut on my left arm, put inside a pinch of soil from my Hall that I take from the bag at my neck, so that it heals with a raised scar.

I fall into a kind of trance, interrupted a couple of times by what seem like distant screams.

When the day returns with a line of light, I climb down from the shelf and set off with the pallet jack in search of a plate for the mirror. I find it twenty-four islands further on, together with a battery of vending machines. This is a rich and fairly virgin portion of the Storage, only the outer shelves have been used. I have breakfast, coffee and bars, take a supply of water. Then I place my mirror on the plate and store the coordinates of permanence of this portion of the storage. They will become part of my Hall‚Äôs database. I am deep inside, the shelves are all full. There is a perfect silence, not even a creak of settling; I look at the perspective of shelves that converges towards a center I have never found. I am fine, I need nothing, I have a good supply of cartridges for my Berettas. My neoprene is intact, it will last a long time yet. I climb on the pallet jack and head towards the entrances.


---

For the return I choose to always follow one direction, I will approach the entrance only at the last passage. I smell the beasts. I slow down, I hear a distant tinkling of bells. I go on. Now I see signs of beasts. Excrements. Bales and cartons opened and left in the middle of the passages. The bells. They sound like the bells of the garments of a Jennifer. A Jennifer, in the Storage. I stop my vehicle and proceed on foot.

I am cautious now. Very. I reach a barricade of wrappings, pass under an empty shelf. It is a Cave. A settlement of beasts, a numerous group that has established residence among the shelves. The bells of the Jennifer are crystalline, they bring out untimely memories. I reach the central nest, follow a passage between stinking bales and rags, peek through an opening between the cartons. The clearing at the center is free. All the wrappings have been removed from the shelves. Among the bare metal trusses a herd of beasts root around. A rod stretched between two shelves holds a hook. On the hook, pierced through the hocks, hangs a Jennifer. Her skirt and veils with the bells fall beyond her waist. Her nakedness is a white blasphemy veined with blood. The body shakes, making the bells jingle.

From the cone of her garments a beast cub falls. Its mouth stained with blood. There must be at least a couple more, below.

The last coherent thought I have is a memory. It is my weapon-master, who taught me a song, when I was small. It is a verse: ‚ÄúJe passerais bien du temps l√†-bas, mon ami.‚Äù

The world becomes something like a thousand furry toys. I come out of hiding. I have the Wakizashi, the short sword, in my hand. I walk among the beasts, dull, they look at me, their reaction times slowed. Or maybe I am in berserker mode. I drive the sword into the sternum of a Sow. I turn it, feel the bone separate. I draw it out, pirouette and cut and run and leap. In the frenzy, I remember the teachings. Hold back the blows, do not let the blade get stuck between the vertebrae or in the skull. Only one cub I behead, clean, a lucky stroke, the blade must have caught the gap between two vertebrae.

A couple of beasts have machine guns. They love machine guns. They fire bursts that fell other beasts. They empty the magazines and I am upon them. The first makes a sort of squeak as I open him from bottom to top. The second tries to run, then stops to look at the steel tip coming out of his chest. Cubs and females climb the uprights, so I sheathe the Wakizashi and do some easy shooting with the Berettas. Not much, only six of them. I am covered in blood. My sword is dirty too, I have sheathed it without cleaning the blade. I will have to wash and do the purification rites. I extract the magazines of the Berettas, change them with two full ones. I go away without looking back, without looking at the Jennifer.

I return to the pallet jack, bring it to the center of the Cave. With my mirror I open its plate and access the tangle of colored tubes. I tear off a couple and smash a reddish cube with the butt of a Beretta. It is a trick my master taught me. I run away. I run for a while, then the pressure wave slaps me between the shoulder blades and throws me to the ground. I turn and see a white globe seething where the cave was. I know that in a few night/day cycles the place will be clean, virgin and new again. The storages renew themselves.

I head for the entrance. I will return to the corridors, I will seek the Hall of the dead Jennifer, idiots, spoiled brood of the Gardens. I will know another Hall. I will remember mine and continue to search. I am the master of my time. I am myself, I am a warrior of the corridors, I lean against an upright and vomit my breakfast, then continue along the aisle of shelves.

Ethan didn‚Äôt glance up. His focus remained on the laptop screen.‚ÄúAre you busy?‚Äù I asked, my voice even, polite.He looked up, his gray eyes meeting mine without any flicker of warmth.‚ÄúA bit,‚Äù he said, voice low and rough. He leaned back in his chair. I placed the folder on his desk, already flipping to the marked pages where his signature was needed.‚ÄúJust a few spots to sign.‚ÄùWithout reading, he picked up the pen lying next to his laptop and began to sign, page after page, his hand moving automatically, his gaze occasionally drifting back to his screen.I watched silently. Ethan looked‚Ä¶worn out. His usually sharp grey eyes were dull, and there were deep shadows under them. He had just come back from London after two weeks at the Annual Alpha Conference ‚Äî a gathering of pack leaders across the globe.But he hadn‚Äôt come back alone.My wolf Yve stirred uneasily inside me.‚ÄòHe reeks of her.‚ÄôI pushed her down gently. There was no point in flaring up.Not when the papers he had just signed held the ending we both needed.When he was finished, he clicked the pen closed and slid it across the table toward me.‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I said, sliding the documents back into my folder.I paused, hesitated, then asked, ‚ÄúWill you be home for dinner tonight?‚ÄùPredictably, Ethan shook his head. ‚ÄúGot some things to wrap up here. Don‚Äôt wait.‚ÄùI nodded, plastering the same empty smile across my face. ‚ÄúGot it. See you around, Alpha,‚Äù I said, forcing my voice to sound like any other obedient wolf under his rule‚Äînot like the Luna and fated mate he seemed to have regretted claiming.‚ÄùI turned away, letting my smile fade once my back was to him.My heels clicked softly against the hardwood floor as I walked toward the door.The air shifted slightly when I passed the annex lounge, and Yve immediately bristled.‚ÄòSmell.‚ÄôSweet vanilla perfume ‚Äî too sweet.I glanced sideways without thinking, my enhanced senses sharpening the image beyond what human eyes would see.Half a box of artisanal pastries sat abandoned on the low glass table. A lipstick-smeared coffee cup beside it. And near the plush lounge chair, a black high-heeled shoe.Yve snarled deep within me, the sound more a vibration across my bones than a true noise.‚ÄòHe brought her here. Here. Not just to London. To our den. Our Pack. He stains our space.‚ÄôMy throat tightened painfully.My chest felt heavy, like something was sitting right on top of it as I turned on my heel and head back, away from this awful place that made me feel disgusted.By the time I got back to my office, exhaustion hit me hard. I dropped into my chair, not even bothering to turn on the lights.Slowly, I pulled out the divorce agreement from the lowest drawer‚Äîthe very document Ethan had just unknowingly signed.My fingers brushed over his perfect signature.Firm. Bold. Unwavering.Just like the way he had pledged himself to me during the mating ceremony years ago. Back then, Ethan had been so firm, so sure. He looked at me like I was his whole world. I had believed it, like a fool.That familiar scent I sniffed earlier‚ÄîI knew exactly who it belonged to. I‚Äôm smarter than this. I should‚Äôve seen it coming.I could still feel the phantom brush of his lips against the mark he placed on my neck.I leaned back in my chair, staring blankly at the ceiling. I could almost hear Ethan‚Äôs mother Amelia‚Äôs voice again‚Äî calm, cold, and cutting. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be naive, Olivia. Men‚Äîeven Alphas‚Äîalways want more. They don‚Äôt stay faithful.‚ÄùA bitter laugh escaped my lips. ‚ÄúYou were always spot on, Amelia,‚Äù I muttered.I realized then that I had been wrong. So, so wrong.Not only had Ethan cheated, but he had taken his mistress to our office.‚ÄòWe deserve better‚Äô, Yve whispered.‚ÄòWe do‚Äô, I agreed.Steeling myself, I picked up my phone, snapped a clear photo of the signed divorce agreement, and attached it to a new message.To: Amelia HawthroneSubject: Agreement CompleteMessage: Ethan has signed, as per our understanding.I hit send without hesitation.The previous week, Amelia had approached me in private.If I agreed to file for divorce quietly, without confronting Ethan or exposing the affair publicly, she would ensure a settlement of $150 million transferred discreetly to my personal accounts.In the world of packs and politics, image was everything. An Alpha embroiled in a public scandal would weaken the Hawthrone Pack‚Äôs standing ‚Äî something Amelia would never allow.Neither would I, truthfully. No matter how broken Ethan had left me, I would not humiliate myself by causing a spectacle.I had my dignity.After a month ‚Äî the grace period to finalize everything ‚Äî Ethan would be free.And so would I.I let out a slow breath, settling into my chair. That‚Äôs when a knock came at the door.‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù I said.Ethan‚Äôs beta, Reed stepped inside, carrying a small, elegant box in both hands.‚ÄúLuna Olivia,‚Äù he said formally, not quite meeting my eyes. ‚ÄúAlpha Ethan asked me to deliver this to you. He bought it for you during his trip to London.‚ÄùReed placed the box on my desk and I flipped the lid open.Inside, nestled on deep blue velvet, was a gleaming diamond set ‚Äî necklace, earrings, bracelet. The same set I had seen in a photo...on her.Disgust crawled up my throat.‚ÄúAlpha Ethan mentioned he... he picked it out personally. Wanted something special for you.‚Äù Reed added quickly, like the words might make it hurt less.I forced a smile, tucking the box back into my desk drawer like it meant nothing.‚ÄúHow thoughtful of him,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúEven with his busy schedule and all‚Äù I said lightly, my tone dripping with sarcasm.Reed flinched slightly. ‚ÄúI should get back,‚Äù He was slipping out, leaving the door swinging shut behind him with a soft thud.My eyes dropped back to the jewelry sitting on my desk, gleaming under the harsh office lights.My stomach twisted in disgust.Without wasting another second, I snapped a photo of it and forwarded it to a second-hand luxury dealer.Me: Donate the full amount to the werewolf orphanage fund.I shut the box with a click, wiping my hands like I‚Äôd just handled garbage. Because, honestly, that‚Äôs what it felt like.By five in the evening, I was wrapping up, gathering my things, and heading to the parking lot.The day had drained me, but it was the kind of exhaustion that sat deeper than muscles or bones.As I stepped outside, the wind shifted, carrying a familiar scent.Leather. Musk. Vanilla.My eyes narrowed instinctively.That‚Äôs when I spotted Ethan‚Äôs car, parked near the exit.Through the window, I caught a glimpse‚ÄîEthan, sitting in the back seat.And right beside him, a vibrant blonde, laughing like she didn‚Äôt have a care in the world.Reed was behind the wheel.The second he saw me, he slammed on the brakes, hard enough that the car jolted.For a heartbeat, everything went still.My eyes locked with Ethan‚Äôs through the glass.Chapter 2Olivia‚Äôs POVI recognized the blonde girl sitting close to Ethan ‚Äî it was Chole Windsor, the daughter of the Alpha of the second-largest pack in the United States.She didn‚Äôt even pretend to be subtle. Her eyes found mine across the lot, but she made no move to step away from Ethan. Instead, she draped her arms over his shoulders, leaned in, and whispered something in his ear. He didn‚Äôt stop her.I looked away. Got into my car, turned the engine, and drove off without sparing them a second glance.I hadn‚Äôt been home for long. After slipping off my shoes at the entrance, I made my way upstairs to the walk-in closet, the quiet of the pack house settling around me.I was standing in front of the wardrobe, picking out a necklace ‚Äî something simple to go with tomorrow‚Äôs blazer ‚Äî when I heard a car pull into the gravel driveway outside.I didn‚Äôt need to look to know who it was.A moment later, I smelled someone behind me.Ethan.I didn‚Äôt turn around. Just clasped the necklace and set it back in its place.‚ÄúAre you upset?‚Äù he asked.‚ÄúObviously,‚Äù I said, still not looking at him. ‚ÄúYou should be careful next time.‚ÄùHe didn‚Äôt respond right away. I heard him exhale through his nose. ‚ÄúThe Windsor pack‚Äôs Alpha wants to collaborate with us. I‚Äôve been talking to Felix, their eldest Alpha-in-line. Chole is his sister.‚ÄùI nodded slightly and turned to face him. ‚ÄúSo to secure the alliance, it‚Äôs necessary to wrap your arms around his sister in public?‚ÄùHis jaw flexed. He didn‚Äôt answer immediately. For a moment, he just looked at me like he didn‚Äôt expect to be questioned. Then his voice hardened.‚ÄúI'm trying to explain, Olivia. Watch your tone when speaking to your Alpha.‚ÄùI stared at him for a second.‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to explain anything to me,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre tired of me and ready to name someone else as Luna, say so. I‚Äôll leave.‚ÄùHis face darkened. ‚ÄúWhat did you just say?‚ÄùI didn‚Äôt flinch. ‚ÄúI said we can get a divorce and break the bond.‚ÄùI stepped past him, but he grabbed my arm. His hand shot up to my chin, gripping it just enough to hold me still without bruising.‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever say that again,‚Äù he said, voice low.I didn‚Äôt respond. Just met his eyes for a beat too long before pulling away.But inside, I already knew ‚Äî I wasn‚Äôt saying it for effect.I‚Äôd been thinking about divorce for weeks. Preparing for it in quiet ways. I didn‚Äôt want him anymore.Ethan stayed home that night. Sat in the Alpha‚Äôs private office most of the evening, didn‚Äôt eat dinner. It was well past midnight when he finally got a phone call that made him leave. I wasn‚Äôt close enough to hear everything, but I caught a woman‚Äôs voice on the other end ‚Äî crying.The next morning, my phone lit up with a message from my friend Ava ‚Äî a lawyer. She had sent me a screenshot of Chole‚Äôs latest post.It was a photo taken at sunrise, from the top of some mountain trail. Two hands clasped together, fingers interlocked.The caption read: ‚ÄúEnjoy the sunrise, feel your heartbeat.‚ÄùI stared at the photo.One of those hands was Ethan‚Äôs. I‚Äôd know that scar near his thumb anywhere.I sat holding my mug for so long the water went cold. Only when I set it down did it make a sound.The following days, Ethan didn‚Äôt return home.At work, we saw each other only during meetings. He sat at the head of the table, and I stayed on the side with the executives. We barely made eye contact. I didn‚Äôt go upstairs to his office, and he didn‚Äôt come down to mine.In the evenings, I started browsing house listings ‚Äî somewhere small, outside the city. I also started clearing out the closet. Anniversary gifts. Jewelry. Even the wedding ring. All of it went to resell platforms or donation. They didn‚Äôt mean anything to me anymore.One evening around 11 p.m., Luna Kate from SilverFang pack texted me out of the blue, inviting me to join her at a club. We were not very familiar‚ÄîI'd only met her a few times when I attended the Pack Summit with Ethan. She was very good at greeting anyone with her fake smile. Her Alpha husband was frequently caught up in scandals, and now she started to be a social butterfly as well.I almost said no. But then I remembered ‚Äî if I really left the Hawthorne Group, I‚Äôd have to build something on my own. Might as well start moving.‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I texted back.When I got to the Moonfell, Kate met me near the entrance. She linked her arm through mine like we were best friends.‚ÄúGlad to see you Olivia,‚Äù she kissed my face. No one but our inner circle knew Ethan and I were married. They always called me Olivia and thought we were just a rumored couple with mate bond.‚ÄúMe too,‚Äù I tried to fake smile.She led me upstairs and into a large room that was divided by a decorative wooden screen.There were people on the other side ‚Äî laughing, drinking, talking loud ‚Äî but Kate brought me to this side, quieter, with just one woman sitting alone. I recognized her vaguely. Mate of someone in Ethan‚Äôs circle. She smiled at me ‚Äî tight, awkward.I took off my coat, sat down, and Kate disappeared a moment later.I picked up a drink, sipped it once, and then I heard it.My name.From the other side of the screen.‚ÄúShe hasn‚Äôt been seen with Alpha Ethan much lately, huh?‚Äù‚ÄúWell, of course not. He takes Chole Windsor everywhere now.‚Äù‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the daughter of the second biggest Pack Alpha in the country. Obviously, she‚Äôs a better fit. Makes the Pack look stronger.‚Äù‚ÄúStill, Olivia and Alpha Ethan were together what ‚Äî eight years? He‚Äôs probably tired of her even though they are mates.‚ÄùThere was a pause. Then a chuckle.‚ÄúShame. She wasted her best years. I‚Äôd still take a go at her, though.‚ÄùThe cup froze in my hand.I recognized the voices. Two of them belonged to the sons of the Gamma and Delta.The woman beside me shifted uncomfortably.I stood up. She looked startled, maybe thinking I was going to leave.Instead, I cleared my throat, picked up my drink, and stepped around the screen.The laughter faded when they saw me.I leaned casually against the edge of the divider, my drink in hand. I looked at the one who‚Äôd spoken last.‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it a bit unfair?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúYou make it sound like I‚Äôve been living off him.‚ÄùThey blinked.I took a sip.‚ÄúEthan was a virgin before we got together. So if I‚Äôve been using him to satisfy my needs for eight years without paying ‚Äî sounds like I got the better deal, doesn‚Äôt it?Silence. The whole room had gone still.Most of them just stared‚Äî and then widened when they looked at someone behind me.Chapter 3Olivia‚Äôs POVI smelled it. I turned around, and there he was.Alpha Ethan.I glanced at him, then looked past him to the low velvet sofa behind. Chole Windsor sat there, legs crossed, glass in hand.Her smile was gone. The way she stared at me ‚Äîher eyes flashing with the territorial aggression of a she-wolf ready to defend her claim ‚Äî made it clear she would've ripped my throat out if she could get away with it.That‚Äôs when it clicked.This wasn‚Äôt some coincidence. They were here together. Chole, Ethan, and their usual circle ‚Äî people I once thought of as allies. This was their private little gathering. From the way they talked earlier, it clearly wasn‚Äôt their first. They didn‚Äôt even care to hide their relationship. Maybe they never had.Ethan walked toward me.Behind him, the group scrambled back to life. One of them stepped forward quickly. ‚ÄúOlivia, we were just messing around‚Äînone of it was serious. We were just talking nonsense.‚ÄùAnother added, ‚ÄúReally sorry. We didn‚Äôt mean anything by it.‚ÄùI didn‚Äôt respond.Ethan reached for my wrist.‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go,‚Äù he said, already trying to pull me out of the room.I didn‚Äôt fight.Instead, I grabbed my drink and threw it in his face, a clear challenge in the presence of his pack.The room fell into complete silence again. Someone gasped. I could hear the ice clink against his cheek as the liquid ran down his jawline.I smiled faintly, ‚ÄúPlease, Alpha, continue enjoying yourself with your beloved. I won‚Äôt interrupt again.‚ÄùThen I lowered my head, tried to pull my hand back from his.His grip only tightened.His face had gone dark. Without another word, he bent down, grabbed me, and threw me over his shoulder like a sack.I kicked instinctively. ‚ÄúEthan‚Äîput me down!‚ÄùHe didn‚Äôt respond.We walked into the hallway, and I struggled on his back, but Ethan didn‚Äôt loosen his grip.The elevator had just arrived on the floor. As he stepped inside and turned around, my upside-down view caught a pair of polished black leather shoes. Then black suit pants, long legs, and pale hands ‚Äî each finger slender, the joints sharp and defined.The air felt still. Quiet but awkward.Ethan walked out of the elevator just as I looked up ‚Äî and met a pair of deep, steady eyes.Sharp and captivating.They held mine for a second too long. I looked away, suddenly embarrassed to be seen like that. Slung over Ethan‚Äôs shoulder like some helpless object.Suddenly, Yve stirred inside me, her instincts sharpening, the primal awareness of another strong wolf nearby sparking her curiosity.I didn‚Äôt know why I felt that way. But I didn‚Äôt like it. It unsettled me.Ethan dragged me out of the club and down the steps to his car. He opened the back door, tossed me in, and climbed in himself.My head spun. Being carried upside down and then thrown like that.He grabbed a wet wipe from the glove compartment and began wiping his face silently.Then he finally spoke. ‚ÄúWhy were you there? You came to catch me, didn‚Äôt you?‚ÄùAs he wiped his cheek, I noticed something just behind the tissue box.A foil wrapper ‚Äî gold, neatly tucked behind the tissue box.A condom.The sight of it made my stomach turn. I looked away immediately and reached for the door handle.‚ÄúI‚Äôm not staying in this car,‚Äù I said.He pulled me back roughly. ‚ÄúWhere do you think you‚Äôre going?‚Äù‚ÄúHome,‚Äù I said, my breathing uneven. ‚ÄúI want to go home.‚Äù‚ÄúStop making trouble, Olivia. My patience is running out.‚ÄùI didn‚Äôt answer. Just sat there, breathing hard.‚ÄúHarold!‚Äù Ethan called out toward the club. ‚ÄúDrive.‚ÄùHarold came out a minute later, nodded, and got into the front seat.The ride was silent. I stayed pressed against the farthest side of the car, arms crossed, staring out the window.By the time we reached the house, I opened the door and got out before the engine had fully stopped.Inside, I went straight to the kitchen and poured a full glass of ice water. I drank all of it in one go.Only then did I feel something close to normal.When I walked back out, Ethan was sitting in the living room. I didn‚Äôt ask why.I sat down across from him.It was quiet for a while. Then he said, ‚ÄúI was there to talk business. A new project.‚ÄùI said nothing.‚ÄúYou showing up and making a scene like that ‚Äî it embarrassed me.‚ÄùHe kept going. ‚ÄúYou looked ridiculous. Screaming, throwing drinks. Like a jealous shrew.‚ÄùI stared at him.He looked back at me, like he expected me to deny it.‚ÄúIs that all?‚Äù I asked.His brows drew together. ‚ÄúIf you want our relationship to work, you need to stop being paranoid all the time. I don‚Äôt have time for your insane suspicions.‚ÄùI nodded. ‚ÄúGot it. Anything else?‚ÄùHe stared at me. ‚ÄúDo you know how annoying you are right now?‚ÄùI stood up slowly.He won‚Äôt be annoyed much longer.I went upstairs, changed into pajamas, and got into bed without another word.He came up about an hour later and found me already asleep.After showering, he got into bed quietly. I turned my back to him and inched closer to the edge, making sure our bodies wouldn‚Äôt touch.That didn‚Äôt stop him.He hugged me from behind and yanked me back into his arms, rough and without a word. He was tall, his Alpha strength undeniable, the raw power of a pack leader. With barely any effort, he held me in place, his grip unyielding, making it clear that resisting would be pointless.I spent the night stiffly, barely moving.By morning, I hadn‚Äôt slept at all. I went downstairs and made breakfast for myself ‚Äî toast, boiled eggs, a glass of milk. I sat alone at the dining table and started eating in silence.Ethan came down a little while later, dressed for work. He glanced toward me but didn‚Äôt say anything at first. He walked halfway to the door, then stopped. A few seconds passed before he turned around and walked over.He leaned in close to my ear.‚ÄúThis weekend,‚Äù he said gently, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go out to sea. Just the two of us. Clear our heads a little.‚ÄùI took a sip of milk and replied without looking at him. ‚ÄúHmm.‚ÄùThat was it.On Friday, he broke the promise.Said he had to fly to Washington for a project. An urgent meeting, supposedly.I wasn‚Äôt surprised. I didn‚Äôt feel anything ‚Äî no disappointment, no anger. Just nothing.Maybe he hasn‚Äôt noticed we haven‚Äôt shared a meal in weeks. We don‚Äôt talk. We don‚Äôt go anywhere. We don‚Äôt spend time like people in a marriage ‚Äî not even like people who live under the same roof.He says divorce is out of the question, but I already feel like someone who doesn‚Äôt exist to him.If I disappeared tomorrow, I genuinely doubt he would even notice.Over the weekend, I started moving books out of the study. Stacked them into a suitcase and took them to my new apartment. The place was smaller. Simpler. But it felt like mine.While I was organizing the shelf, my phone rang.Melina.I hesitated, then picked up. ‚ÄúHello, Luna Melina.‚Äù Ever since I married his son eight years ago, she still asks me to call her luna.She snorted arrogantly. ‚ÄúCome over now. We need to put down in writing what we discussed earlier.‚ÄùI paused. ‚ÄúIs that really necessary?‚ÄùShe didn‚Äôt hesitate. ‚ÄúIf I say so.‚Äù""Fine. I'll go back this afternoon,"" I answered.Yet, she wasn't satisfied. ""Come back at noon.""Chapter 4Olivia‚Äôs POVI arrived atHawthorne Manoraround 11 AM.As I approached the main entrance, a sweet, overly cheerful voice drifted out through the partially open windows.‚ÄúYay! I won again!‚Äù The girl‚Äôs tone was playful, but there was a flirtatious edge to it, the kind meant to tease a lover. ‚ÄúAre you letting me win on purpose, Ethan?‚ÄùI paused, my hand hovering over the door handle. I didn‚Äôt need to see her to know who it was.Chole Windsor.I realized the real purpose of Melina, she wanted to humiliated me.I took a slow breath, letting Yve‚Äôs quiet growl settle in my chest, then pushed open the door and stepped inside.Ethan was in the living room, his head turning sharply when he caught sight of me. For a moment, his eyes flickered with surprise, quickly masked by a flash of annoyance. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚ÄùI walked in, slipping my sunglasses off and tucking them into the pocket of my loose white T-shirt. I hadn‚Äôt bothered with makeup today, just jeans and a comfortable shirt. I met his eyes,‚ÄúYour mom didn‚Äôt tel you? She called me.‚Äù I continued, ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt know you were back from London so soon. Or are you a magician now, managing to be in two places at once?‚ÄùHis jaw tightened, a flicker of guilt flashing in his eyes. He didn‚Äôt respond.Before he could recover, Chole stood up from the plush velvet sofa. She brushed an invisible speck of dust off her thigh, showing off her perfectly manicured fingers.‚ÄúHi,‚Äù she extened her hand, stepping closer with a bright smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Chole Windsor. It‚Äôs nice to meet you.‚ÄùI looked at her outstretched hand for a second, then deliberately ignored her.Melina entered the room. She wore a tailored black dress, her hair swept back in a flawless chignon, a perfect image of power and control. Her eyes moved over me briefly before settling on Chole.‚ÄúChole, darling,‚Äù she said, taking Chole‚Äôs hand in both of hers,‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre having a good time today. Make yourself at home. This is your house too.‚ÄùI felt a muscle in my jaw tighten, but I kept my face neutral.Melina‚Äôs eyes flicked to me, her expression cooling instantly.‚ÄúAh, Olivia. You‚Äôre here.‚ÄùShe turned back to Chole, her tone still warm.‚ÄúThis is Ms. Hawthorne, the manager of the Hawthorne Group. She‚Äôs here on business.‚ÄùIt took every ounce of self-control not to roll my eyes. She made it sound like I was just another employee, someone here to deliver a report, not the Luna of the pack or her son‚Äôs wife. It was a subtle dismissal, a deliberate way to tell Chole that I was no threat.I ignored her, my eyes drifting back to Ethan. He didn‚Äôt even try to defend my position.‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you say we had business to discuss? Let‚Äôs get it over with.‚ÄùMelina‚Äôs smile tightened slightly.‚ÄúWe can discuss it another day. You‚Äôre here now, so why not join us for a meal?‚ÄùI exhaled slowly, already tired of this charade.‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here for a meal, Melina. I have other things to do.‚ÄùI turned to leave, my back already to them.Her voice sharpened,‚ÄúI am still the pack luna, Olivia, and I have asked you politely to stay. What is this attitude of yours? No manners at all.‚ÄùI paused, my hand stilling on the back of a leather chair. I turned slowly, meeting her icy stare with one of my own.‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôll stay for a meal.‚ÄùI met her gaze without blinking.‚ÄúJust make sure you don‚Äôt regret it.‚ÄùChole, sensing the tension, quickly tried to lighten the atmosphere,‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs perfect. I was just telling Ethan how much I enjoyed winning our little game of Silver Moon Toss earlier. I‚Äôd love to keep playing.‚ÄùI glanced at the balcony where a polishedSilver Moon Tosstarget stood, several delicate gold rings stacked neatly beside it. I hadn‚Äôt even noticed it before. Clearly, it was something new ‚Äî probably Chole‚Äôs idea.Silver Moon Tosswas a light social competition often played atwerewolf gatherings. The rules were simple ‚Äî players took turns tossing three golden rings, trying to encircle the movingMoon Pillarfive meters away. It required precision and rhythm, often used to showcase coordination between couples.Chole‚Äôs eyes lit up when she saw me looking at the ring toss setup.‚ÄúOh, Olivia, do you know how to playSilver Moon Toss?‚ÄùI met her gaze, catching the hint of challenge behind her bright smile.‚ÄúOnly a little,‚ÄùI replied, letting my eyes linger on her for a beat.‚ÄúWanna play?‚ÄùEthan‚Äôs jaw tightening as he shot me a warning look.‚ÄúOf course. Shall I go first, or would you like the honor?‚Äù Chole adjusted one of the gold rings on the table, her confidence flaring.‚ÄúGo ahead. I‚Äôll watch.‚Äù I stepped back, casually folding my arms.Chole‚Äôs smile widened, clearly pleased with herself. She stepped into position, her posture perfect, each movement precise. She took a steadying breath, then flicked her wrist. The golden ring sliced through the air, narrowly missing the Moon Pillar, landing just a few centimeters off.She turned back to me,‚ÄúAlmost nailed it.‚ÄùBehind her, Melina‚Äôs eyes followed the ring,‚ÄúChole. So graceful.‚ÄùChole gave a appreciative nod, clearly loving the praise.I didn‚Äôt bother with any of the theatrics. I stepped forward, picked up a ring, and tossed it without much thought. The ring cut through the air cleanly, glinting in the sunlight before slipping perfectly around the Moon Pillar with a clear, satisfying clink.Chole‚Äôs smile froze for a second, her fingers tightening around the ring she still held. She forced a thin, strained smile.‚ÄúLucky shot.‚ÄùI let a careless smile spread across my lips, leaning back slightly.‚ÄúMaybe.‚ÄùI shrugged,‚ÄúLast time I played this was at the Alpha Foundation dinner with Ethan.‚ÄùThe remark hit its mark. Chole‚Äôs face tensed, her grip on the ring tightening as she prepared for the next throw.Melina stepped in quickly,‚ÄúDear, it‚Äôs just a game. The important thing is to have fun.‚ÄùI shrugged, stepping back.‚ÄúOf course. But some people get carried away too easily.‚ÄùI didn‚Äôt miss the way Melina‚Äôs eyes flicked to Ethan, a silent accusation in them.In the next few rounds, I almost hit every ring, each one sliding smoothly around theMoon Pillarwith a clear, satisfying clink. Meanwhile, Chole‚Äôs throws grew increasingly off-target, her rings clattering against the base or falling short entirely.I noticed the slight tremble in her fingers as she reached for another ring, her forced smile tightening with every miss, her eyes flashing with barely concealed frustration.",1,1756756738.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False
1n5z0vb,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1n5z0vb/bought_a_meraki_some_thought_and_ama/,Bought a Meraki - Some Thought and AMA,"Got a new Meraki machine this past Friday and thought I'd add a few notes, pros/cons, and see if any questions on it I can help with.

Background - Have been using an Oracle + Sette 270 for the past 4.5ish years. Oracle was starting to have some issues that I wanted to get fixed but was having some high prices quoted for a fix and didn't want to dig in to fixing myself, particularly for an older machine

Started looking around at some machines but had a few requirements to meet. Notably my SO drinks a latte daily and wants a simple workflow, particularly for measuring out beans, auto-frothing (no manual frothing), and output. We were previously single dosing with the Sette due to the Oracle being very inconsistent with grind. But wanted to get an integrated grinder or a smaller machine to save on some counter space. On the other hand, I like to tinker a bit more with trying different beans out, temperatures, pre-infusions, etc... So ultimately wanted a machine that could do a bit of both.

Only really considered a few machines, but decided on the Meraki due to the integrated scales for grinder/brew and frothing. 

* Oracle Jet/New Oracle Dual Boiler
* Meraki

**Pros:**

* Very quiet (relative to previous setup), can barely hear from room next door.
* Simple setup out of box, able to have some great coffee within 5-10 minutes without much tuning
* Great steam wand, seriously blew the Breville one out of the water. Also like the experience of using much more, thought the Breville was a bit clunky under the machine for getting an angle.
* Really convenient workflow with weighted grinding/brewing
* Nice consistency on grind
* Looks really nice. Bit more of a personal preference but think the machine looks great.

Cons:

* A bit of waste with changing out beans.
* Limited use of RFID setup at this time
* Plastic under steam wand/drip tray can smell funny/seems hard to clean.
* Portafilter grinds while twisting in, maybe will smooth out after a few uses (it hasn't yet).
* Small milk pitcher provided (used a bigger one I already had)
* Hard to get basket out of portafilter,
* Descale/cleaning looks a bit funky (haven't gotten to maintenance yet)
* Can't easily access/save coffee profiles/drinks (from what I've seen) - there may be a way but I haven't gotten to it yet.
* Pre-infusion a bit confusing - still playing around with setup but haven't done much yet.

Note, I have no affiliation with either company.

1. Overview

Kendu is positioning itself as the evolution of the memecoin. Unlike Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, or Pepe that leaned purely on social media hype, Kendu combines memetic virality with IRL (in real life) brand efforts, coining the term Brandcoin.

With a current market cap under $20M, Kendu already has a sprawling ecosystem of real-world businesses, community-led initiatives, and creative projects. This combination acts as a proof of humanity and resilience against the AI-driven, bot-filled, scam-prone landscape of today‚Äôs crypto markets.


---

2. Strengths & Opportunities

‚úÖ Real-World Utility & Brand Building

Coffee, energy drinks, hotdog stands, vapes, vending machines, apparel, sneakers, jewelry, plushies.

Video games (with revenue share to treasury), board games, anime series, entertainment events.

Unique community-driven projects like tattoos, murals, glow-in-the-dark pickleball tournaments.


‚úÖ Community-First DNA

No centralized dev team. Entirely grassroots and permissionless.

Strong IRL activations prove real adoption vs. empty promises.


‚úÖ Timing Advantage

Current altseason narrative is shifting: ‚ÄúNot just memes, but real utility + memes = next big run.‚Äù

Positioned as ‚ÄúNext Shiba‚Äù with deeper IRL roots.


‚úÖ Brandcoin Thesis

Sets a new category: ‚ÄúBrandcoin‚Äù ‚Üí A memecoin + consumer brand hybrid.

Investors looking for the next evolution after Doge, Shib, Pepe are primed for this narrative.

---

3. Weaknesses & Risks

‚ö†Ô∏è Execution Risk

With no centralized team, coordination may be slower.

Quality control of products can vary since initiatives are decentralized.


‚ö†Ô∏è Market Competition

Other memecoins may attempt IRL expansions.

Needs continuous momentum to avoid dilution of the Brandcoin thesis.


‚ö†Ô∏è Scaling Challenge

IRL businesses require capital, logistics, distribution.

While community-driven is powerful, large-scale rollout needs structure.

---

4. Market & Sector Outlook

Memecoins are still dominant this cycle, but differentiation matters. Pure memes will pump & dump; hybrids with utility, IRL branding, and strong communities will sustain.

Consumer + Crypto fusion is emerging. Projects that exist both on-chain & IRL will resonate with retail investors and brands looking for partnerships.

Macro tailwinds: Bitcoin halving cycle + liquidity rotation into mid and low caps favors narratives like Kendu.

---

5. Bull Scenario & Price Prediction

Current Market Cap: ~$20M

Shiba Inu 2021 Market Cap Peak: >$40B

Dogecoin 2021 Market Cap Peak: >$80B


Even a fraction of those peaks, under the Brandcoin thesis, would be explosive.

Bull Case Targets for 2025 Altseason

Conservative Target (x10) ‚Üí $200M market cap

Mid Target (x50) ‚Üí $1B market cap (achievable with strong IRL + meme hype combo)

Moonshot Target (x200) ‚Üí $4B market cap (if Kendu cements ‚ÄúBrandcoin‚Äù as the next big crypto narrative)


üëâ At sub-$20M MC today, a $1B cap would be a 50x, and a $4B cap would be a 200x opportunity.


---

üéØ Final Analysis

Kendu is more than a memecoin; it‚Äôs the prototype of the Brandcoin era. With IRL proof, strong community DNA, and narrative alignment for this cycle, it has the right ingredients to outperform typical meme plays.

If the Brandcoin thesis takes off the way Shib once did in 2021, Kendu could easily hit $1B+ market cap this cycle.

Flights in/out of SNA - avoid LAX if at all possible.

We arrived on Saturday August 23rd and should‚Äôve switched our first park day to Sunday, but we kept it with Tuesday/Wednesday/Friday. We had park hopper + LL tickets.

Absolutely recommend:
- Afternoon break if you rope drop 
- Stay @ hotel within walking distance 
- Good shoes!! (we walked a combined 95,000 steps over 3 days and I feel completely fine after wearing OCs)
- Decrease park hopping when the entrance gate is busy (wasted a lot of time hopping on our last day unfortunately as Friday night got really busy)
- Rope drop the breakfast chimichangas so you have something to eat in your first line up (esp if it‚Äôs Peter Pan or Rise)
- Getting tshirts and ears for cheap prior to your trip
- UV umbrella for instant shade (I liked my cooling towel but my husband and daughter didn‚Äôt use them)

We stayed at the SunCoast Park Hotel. It was a great deal, has a pool, is clean and has a nice lobby and offers breakfast for purchase. The walk to the park took us about 15-20 minutes.

1n5ysr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1n5ysr9/going_insane_on_our_vacation/,Going insane on (our) vacation.,"I (28F) am on vacation with my BF/husband and 1y/o son. 

Little backstory; my husband and I are together for almost 8 years, married for almost one and have a 1 y/o together. When I met him I was a smoker, smoked weed and cigarettes. He was fine with that back then. 

In the 8 years of us being together we never been on a holiday with just the two of us. It was always with friends. Even our soms first vacation was with friends. Weve been on weekend trips but I don't think it's the same as a 3 week long vacation. 

I've been quite down since te birth of our son. Don't get me wrong, I love my son so much! I even miss him when he's asleep. But I just miss the person I was before having him. 

So as an excuse to feel more like myself I picked up smoking again. I quit during pregnancy but the urge to smoke won and now I am on vacation and I just love to have a smoke so now and then. Mind you, I don't smoke anywhere near my son. I'll always stay a few meters away from him or any other child. 

My husband hates it. Everytime I light up a smoke my husband will comment. And will start ranting about how it's bad, how I need to quit etc. I've counted how much I smoked today, it where 5 cigarettes. Two of those where in the presence of my son who was with his dad at that time. Again; I'll stand a few meters away. 

My husband does not only give me shit about smoking, he gives me shit about not hurrying up in the morning. While I'm dressing myself and my son, getting his diaper bag ready and my son's snacks making sure we all have breakfast and my husband and I both had our morning coffee. Yesterday I forgot my son's sunhat. Today I forgot the Instax 360. He's giving me shit for everything! I have to think about everything, have to pack everything and he's sitting there doom scrolling on his phone and when I light up a smoke he's hating me for it. (He's also hating me for forgetting shit) 

And when I get upset because I will feel guilty about forgetting my son's sunhat or the camera he will say things like ""don't be sad -name-, you did this yourself you forgot his sunhat but you sure brought your smokes didn't you?""  

It makes me sad. Why can't we have a fun holiday as a family. Why are our vacations only fun when there are friends involved. 
I'm sad 

I know I'm wrong for smoking. I just want to feel like myself. It's no excuse. I'm sorry. 
Thanks for reading..

1n5yqqf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n5yqqf,Helpful Prodect/Tools/Aids,"DISCLAIMER: I'm not a Dr, this is not medical advise.


About a year ago my father started falling repeatedly. I knew our home was unsafe for him, but didn't know what to do to help it be safe. I just wanted someone to come and and tell us what to change or buy. It didn't happen until months later after he's been diagnosed with Parkinson's and had a bad enough fall to warrant home health care. Those ladies were beyond helpful, especially the occupational therapist. 

Since I never found one, I put together a list of EVERYTHING that has helped him or me. I hope this helps someone else! 

Let me know if anything is wonky or not working. 


Grippy socks: https://a.co/d/1BXJsl8 
   - I heard bombas are the best, but he has leg swelling and the bombas were too tight. 

Water cup: https://a.co/d/9INXaL6 
  - The handle and (below) straw are helpful especially when he's shaking. 
 - Thinking of getting this one because his current one falls over a lot when he's moving and it's on his walker tray... https://a.co/d/3n7wg8g
 - Straw he uses... https://a.co/d/7LL55mx 

Coffee mug: https://www.yeti.com/drinkware/mugs/21071507368.html 
   - He broke about three mugs and his coffee kept spilling when it was on his walker tray. This has a handle, lid, and unbreakable!

Gait belt: https://a.co/d/bFtwL9e 
   - This has been INSANELY helpful. He puts it on every time we leave the house and I can keep a hand on it when he's walking, going down a couple steps, etc. It really helps when he starts to fall. 

Alarm button for falls/emergencies: https://a.co/d/1gQrfCw 
   - Recommend by another Reddit user. He's used this a few times when he fell and I'm still asleep (we sleep on different floors). We call it Bing Bong because of the sound it makes. 

Walker regular size: https://a.co/d/bVcylKf 
   - Walker tray: https://a.co/d/1LinlZU 

Transfer bench for tub/shower: https://a.co/d/4zlG2tB 
   -  He sits on the end and then scootches his butt over and swings his legs over the tub wall. He said this has been VERY helpful. Makes shower time less stressful for both of us. 

Tablet: https://a.co/d/650kGZu 
   - He was having problems reading books because of the print size. Got him a fire tablet so he can customize the font size. He won't buy regular books anymore. 

Hip kit: https://a.co/d/frQtpKv 
   - Besides the loofah, he doesn't use much out of this, but has some good stuff to have if/when he does need it. 

New toilet (not his exact one, but similar): https://www.lowes.com/pd/KOHLER-1-piece-elongated-toilet-1-28-gpf/7270787? 
   - He took out TWO toilets falling back when standing up. I researched and went with a one piece toilet hoping for less weak spots. It's still standing! I also believe the toilet seat riser helped. 

Toilet seat riser: https://a.co/d/2pi2AZN 
   - Makes getting off the toilet SO MUCH easier. 

Pill box: https://a.co/d/00C9tIf 
   - Allows him to dump pills easily into his hand instead of picking them out one by one or having a large pill box that he has to turn over. 

Seat riser and cushion: https://a.co/d/50RBPaO 
   - He has a 4"" and 2"" on his wheelchair at the kitchen table. 

Grip material for cushions on wheelchair because they like to slide: https://a.co/d/6CLH9qd 

Stryker cleansing wipes: https://a.co/d/4Wx7srZ 
   - They use these in hospitals and they work great if you can't shower, but they're pricey.

Adult wet wipes: https://a.co/d/0Q3pMso 
   - Do not work as well as the above Stryker wipes, but more cost effective for every day use. 

Tennis balls for walker: https://a.co/d/iGJZziQ 
   - Tried less expensive ones, but they wore out in a couple days, these last 4-5 days. He tried the skis and wasn't a fan. 
   - IF YOU KNOW ANY OTHER ALTERNATIVES, PLEASE DM ME! It's kind of a pain to change them out all the time. 

Shower mat: https://a.co/d/5KgtDLW 

Grab bars: 
https://a.co/d/9rZQNFO 
   - This is actually on the counter so he can grab it when he opens the fridge, gives him something solid to hold.
https://a.co/d/hTOSEFc 
   - Uses in shower
   *Disclaimer: permanent installed ones are much safer, we just can't install them in his shower.

Tegaderm/transparent dressing for skin tears: https://a.co/d/dzq6JG7 
   - His Dr recommended these. I leave it on for 5 days then clean and change. I like that it's transparent so we can see if it's looking infected. 

TV headphones: https://a.co/d/bq9YeVx 

Paint pens: https://a.co/d/3iUHHmK 
   - See pics. These have helped him in locating charging ports, volume buttons, etc.


Soap dispenser: https://a.co/d/buuPZBt 
   - He was using the regular ones that the soap comes in but was having a problem with the angle and pressure pushing down and it was regularly careening off the vanity. This works better because this is wide and low (and glass and heavier). 

Larger walker as his feet turn out and he keeps kicking the regular sized one: https://a.co/d/iHcL6be 
  - Tray for larger walker: https://athome.medline.com/en/medline-bariatric-walker-tray-g07850mbh 

Things he already had and uses regularly:
   - Bed grab bar similar to this:  https://a.co/d/aG6I42c 
   - Wheelchair from probably the 80s at the kitchen table. It's much easier to get in and out of than a regular kitchen chair. The cushions above are used on this.",2,1756756052.0,ParkinsonsCaregivers,0,1.0,False

Find happiness in reading, watching films, listening to music, going for a coffee, eating out, and such. 

I no longer wanted to use the apps last year. And wanted to change my lifestyle a bit. So I reconnected with an old friend of mine who was going out on his own, and we decided to go out together, practically every weekend. 

We‚Äôve made some great memories don‚Äôt get me wrong. Some nights have been great. Most though have been just.. not good? Waking up the next morning feeling like shit and feeling empty. 

I think the issue is, I go mainly to see if a hook up can happen. Or get a number. And while I have been approached, and approach a few times, I‚Äôve never actually hooked up. It‚Äôs pretty hard out there. Feel like it‚Äôs a matter of luck of sitting next to the right person.

But the issue is I focus way too much on women, and not enough on having fun. Some nights I dance here and there. But the truth is, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm in the environment I naturally belong in. 

Reddit threads told me not to have the self limiting belief of disliking clubs and bars and that‚Äôs why I approached it with an open mind. But a year later I think I genuinely do dislike being in this environment. I can‚Äôt relate to most of the people. The alcohol I don‚Äôt even like and just drink to vibe with the night. I hate the way it makes me feel. 

Even on nights when I have some social success, I get no fulfillment out of it really. Used to think me not liking socializing was a cope for dealing with my social awkwardness and the rejections I face. But even on nights where I make acquaintances and such, I don‚Äôt feel anything. It all feels superficial at the end of the night for me. 

I suppose having ADHD and OCD is what makes feel this way. The feeling isolation, and obsession with idea of hooking up and women in general. 

But if the environment were for me, I likely would not focus on that stuff too much. I go to the library and coffee shops with hopes that maybe I‚Äôll meet someone. If it doesn‚Äôt, which it hasn‚Äôt so far, I don‚Äôt care. Because I enjoyed reading history and philosophy at the library, or enjoyed my vanilla flavored coffee. I don‚Äôt obsess with the idea of romance because I at least am enjoying what I do. 

At the club however I think I hyper fixate on women because.. that‚Äôs all that interests me. Not the alcohol, not the music, not the environment.

And it sucks. Because I did genuinely want like a hook up phase. It just seems however I‚Äôm not wired to enjoy the environments in where they happen. 

I miss my old life. Again I made some great memories and I‚Äôm glad I got closer to my friends, but I miss feeling normal on the weekends, and not being tired. I think I was happier living a chill life 24/7. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. ",3,1756755699.0,self,0,1.0,False

1n5yj63,https://www.reddit.com/r/webhosting/comments/1n5yj63/mission_impossible/,mission impossible?,"10 years ago I had a rather successful hosting company. Unfortunately, I ended up getting REALLY interested in coffee, so I started my own coffee roasting business and shut down the hosting business after selling all clients to another company. Since my roasting company needed a webshop, I down into the different softwares avail and ended up with Wordpress and Woocommerce. The short story here is that I used all my knowledge from running dedicated servers to set up a dedicated server(s) with the webshop on and it has now become so finely tuned that I can easily have 90 plugins, load time of about 1 second, almost perfect score on GTMetrix, PageSpeed and Pingdom and we have hundreds of visitors every day on our site. This brings me to my mission impossible-question; A bunch of my friends and others have discovered what I do and wants me to set up their worpress site or woocommerce-site and this of course has lead me into thinking there is some money to be made, as I obviously is not the only one who wants a good setup for Wordpress or primarily Woocommerce. So I am thinking about setting up a service for people so that they can buy optimized dedicated servers or VPS to host their Wordpress-installation and we will also mange their entire Wordpress-installations. I know; not exactly revolutionary, but it seems that there is some interest for my little niche-setup so I want to explore it. 

The problem is that i am having a hard time figuring out how to automate things or if it is even possible. I have used various tools to deploy servers over the years. My main setup ""back in the days"" were WHMCS and dedicated Hetzner-servers with cPanel and shared hosting. Easy peasy! 

Currently, I use Ploi to deploy servers and set up websites on the servers, as I find things easy to handle via their control panel and then I can do all manual tweaks via SSH. 

I really like WHMCS and personally I think it would be ideal to handle billing and support, but I am unsure about the automated setup of things, as there are no modules around for Ploi (or Runcloud, as this also is a tool I have used). I have over the years used a LOT of different services and tools for various jobs, but my search for the ideal setup to automate everything has so far come up empty.

That being said; People are willing to pay good money for this, so this will not be you $9 a month hosting. Haven\`t decided for a price yet, but the clients I have pitched the idea to and have tested my setup are willing to pay a very decent price per month to have everything managed. And it will be 100% managed, as I really don\`t want to install any control panes on the servers. Both to keep everything mean and lean and I really don\`t want the customers to make any changes themselves and mess up stuff üòâ Everything has to go through us. Perhaps an automated setup is not needed for this kind of service? Instead reach out to the customer via phone, if this is not too 1999?

Anybody else who is running something similar that can offer som advice on how they run their services?",1,1756755556.0,webhosting,1,1.0,False
1n5yio9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1n5yio9/recurring_sudden_lightheadedness_during_any/,Recurring sudden lightheadedness during any physical activity,"26M, 190lbs, 6'2, Indian

Last wednesday I was out running and all of a sudden I felt a numbness in my right leg, closely followed by a feeling of lightheadedness and dizziness like I was about to pass out. I could fight back the feeling if I stopped and took some deep breaths. I kept trying to run but it kept happening, and eventually I walked the rest of the way back and got some water and it didn't happen again the rest of that night. At that point I was assuming it was some sort of dehydration.

The next day when I got out of bed the feeling started happening more frequently, always the leg numbness and the lightheadedness at the same time, whether I was sitting down or standing up. Only when laying down did it seem to stop completely. I went to urgent care, who directed me to the ER to get blood work done. The ER didn't find anything wrong with me so they sent me to primary care the next day. I got more blood tests done at primary care and they again didn't find anything wrong; normal B12 levels, normal iron levels, normal blood sugar. The doctor gave me no diagnosis and then told me to see a physical therapist and a cardiologist, but I'll have to wait a while for those appointments.

Since then I have mostly stayed sedentary, only doing things around the house, and things seemed to be improving. The leg numbness seems to be more faint and less frequent, and the lightheadedness doesn't occur when I'm sitting down anymore. But then today I went out to get groceries and the episodes occurred several times while I was standing and walking around, which is what is causing me to want to look for answers. Even just walking around the grocery store, I felt a few times like I was about to pass out and a sudden panic set in, and only after leaning against something and taking some deep breaths did it go away.

I have no idea what's going on with me. I've looked up my symptoms several times with different wording and nothing seems to match. Google keeps telling me it's orthostatic hypotension but I don't think so; this doesn't just occur when I stand up, it's constantly occurring the entire time I'm walking around. The doctor suggested it was BPPV but I did the exercise for it and it didn't help. And any diagnosis involving pain doesn't match either, since there's no pain.

I'm a very healthy person. I'm a lifelong vegetarian, I don't smoke anything, I drink very moderately, I get tons of sleep, regularly exercise, maybe a little too much coffee but nothing crazy. I'm not on any medications. I haven't had any injuries in at least a year. Nothing like this has ever happened to me. And I wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary to trigger this; I run and play tennis fairly often.

I (28F) am 16 days post-op from gallbladder removal and am worrying myself sick with all these aches and pains. I was told by my surgeon 2 weeks if I take it easy, eat a low fat diet, and take frequent walks I would be feeling just fine and able fo eat about anything. However recovery has been a bit rough. 

I am currently experiencing a lot of random pains in my chest, upper (EDIT) right side,lower/upper left side, and lower back with soreness afterwards. Also feeling uncomfy bloating and enflamed when needing to have a bowel movement. 

These started showing up a little after my Post-Op Appointment with my surgeon on Aug. 27th, gave ok to introduce some things back into diet. I braved a small half cup of coffee and suffered the consequences of enflamed constipation. üòñ
Same thing happened 2 days later with a half cup of skim milk, ouch!

I may be overdoing it with the exercise too, Im not sure. Im very tired a lot of the time.

This has been my very first major surgery and every pain I have felt post-op has had me so worried something else is wrong after experiencing issues with my gallbladder. It has been a day at a time sort of experience with all this. 

Did anyone else experienced these symptoms that far out from the surgery? How long did it take to resolve?

I feel Im being overlydramatic with the pain of recovery. Especially after hearing how several others can go a week of recovery and going straight back to normal with no issues with what they eat. Its very disheartening.

This will help you with brand recognition.

The store looks ok. Nothing to write home about. But it does not look professional

Regarding marketing, here are a few things that can help:

* **Get clear on your angle**: Right now it feels like general seasonal merch. Figure out who it‚Äôs *for* (eco-friendly buyers, outdoorsy types, gift shoppers, etc.). That focus will make your messaging stronger.
* **Social proof & visuals**: Don‚Äôt rely only on mockups. Post lifestyle pics (hoodie on someone outside in fall, tumbler on a desk, etc.) and try sending a couple samples to micro-influencers for reviews.
* **Build an email list early**: Even a small one beats just posting on socials. Offer a discount or ‚Äúfirst to know‚Äù perk.
* **Seasonal promos**: Lean into bundles and themes (‚ÄúSweater Weather Set‚Äù = hoodie + tumbler). Small tweaks like that give people a reason to buy now.
* **Keep product pages specific**: Short, benefit-focused copy (‚Äúultra-soft fleece for chilly mornings‚Äù) feels more real than generic descriptions.

Start small. Pick one or two channels you can stick with (say Instagram + email). Marketing works best when you tell a story people can connect with, not just list products.

I asked ChatGPT for a little help (I hope you don't mind me using AI to help you a bit further):

Here are some Instagram content ideas you could suggest for CircaSeasons to make their store feel alive and attract buyers:

# 1. Lifestyle Shots

* Show someone wearing the hoodie while drinking coffee outdoors on a crisp morning.
* Tumbler in a cozy fall flat lay: blanket, book, pumpkin spice vibes.
* Baseball cap with casual autumn outfit (jeans + boots).

# 2. Behind-the-Scenes / Brand Story

* A Reel introducing ‚ÄúWhy CircaSeasons exists‚Äù ‚Äî quick clips of nature, changing leaves, cozy moments, with captions like ‚ÄúInspired by the seasons.‚Äù
* Share design sketches or mockup process (carousel post).

# 3. Seasonal Tie-Ins

* Countdown to Fall: ‚ÄúüçÇ 7 days until sweater weather ‚Äî are you ready?‚Äù
* Bundle spotlight: hoodie + tumbler = ‚ÄúSweater Weather Set.‚Äù
* Weekly ‚ÄúSeasonal Mood‚Äù posts (fall playlist recs, cozy activities, pumpkin recipes) tied to the brand vibe.

# 4. User-Generated Content / Community

* Encourage buyers to tag photos with their products using a branded hashtag (#MyCircaSeason).
* Repost tagged stories to show real people using the merch.

# 5. Interactive Content

* Polls in Stories: ‚ÄúPumpkin spice or apple cider?‚Äù with product images subtly in the background.
* Quizzes: ‚ÄúWhich fall essential are you? Hoodie, tumbler, or cap?‚Äù

# 6. Quick Reels / TikTok Cross-Posts

* 5‚Äì10 second Reel of outfit transitions featuring the hoodie and jacket (‚ÄúSummer ‚ûù Fall transformation‚Äù).
* ‚ÄúUnboxing‚Äù video of your own products ‚Äî gives authenticity since POD stores often look generic.

# 7. Testimonials & Reviews

* Even if you only have a few early buyers, turn their words into aesthetic quote graphics:
   * Example: *‚ÄúThe hoodie feels like a warm hug on a chilly morning.‚Äù* paired with product photo.",1,1756755114.0,Printify,0,1.0,False

1n5y8q2,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1n5y8q2/slowly_tapering_off_but_dont_understand_why/,Slowly tapering off... but don't understand why caffeine has this effect now,"I had no success going cold-turkey, so I try to slooooowwwwwly taper off caffeine. I used to take like 600-700 mg every day, and now down to about 225 mg average. So, I guess it should be fine.

It is not.

For some reason, it seems like I don't tolerate caffeine anymore. I used to take 2 ""energy"" drinks (about 300 mg) + like 3-4 coffees each day and it was working fine. Now I'm down to about 1 ""energy"" drink (150 mg) and if I take more than 100 mg over that in coffee, I get nauseous, feel spaced out, completely tired and just so strange. And before I used to be able to drink caffeine until 6:00 PM and sleep at night; now anything after 3:00 PM disturbs my sleep a lot.

Mostly, I get some buzz from the 150-200 mg zone, but can't go much over it without feeling really bad.

I know the easy answer will be : ""Dude, just stop it"". 

Yeah, I know.

But I'd like to understand WHY it does this to me. I know a couple of months ago I had to increase my SSNI med because of high anxiety, and it seems it uses the same CYP1A2 pathway to detox caffeine, but I increased moderately (about 33%, but it was like 4 months ago), so could it be because of it, even 4 months later? A couple of years ago, I used to take the same med at much higher dose, and that was when I would take 600-700 mg caffeine without any problem.

Anyone can relate? It seems like my body can't deal with caffeine anymore. Why? What causes this?

1n5y0hk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeRigged/comments/1n5y0hk/reveal_if_the_best_coffee_maker_keurig_kduo_is/,Reveal if the Best Coffee Maker Keurig K-Duo Is Worth the Buzz,"The Keurig K-Duo Special Edition packs so much practicality into one sleek machine that I couldn't resist trying it for myself. This coffee maker, designed for both single-serve K-Cup pods and traditional ground coffee, had me curious from the get-go. It promises versatility, ease of use, and that shiny silver finish adds a touch of modernity to any kitchen countertop. After putting it through its paces over a few weeks, here's how it stacked up for daily use in my home.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
The design of this coffee machine immediately catches the eye. Its polished silver finish gives it a premium, stylish look that fits seamlessly into my kitchen. It's not just about looks, though‚Äîthe design is practical. The shared 60 oz water reservoir between the single-serve and carafe brewing modes means fewer refills, which is an underrated convenience when you‚Äôre busy in the morning. The metallic handle on the included 12-cup carafe adds a nice touch of sophistication, and the heating plate keeps the coffee warm for those slow-moving mornings. Its footprint isn't too imposing either; at around 12.76 x 10.94 x 12.92 inches, it‚Äôs a comfortable fit on most countertops.  

**Performance in Everyday Situations**  
I tend to switch between brewing a single strong cup and a full carafe for when guests come over, and this machine handles both scenarios effortlessly. The ability to program a carafe up to 24 hours in advance also saves the day, especially when I want coffee to greet me first thing in the morning. The Strong Brew option for single-serve cups produces a bold taste that can cut through even the heaviest dose of milk and sugar. Trust me, I tested it with my ""barely-a-coffee-anymore"" lattes, and the flavor shone through!

**[Check Keurig K-Duo Special Edition price on Amazon.](https://raifords.com/p/b095xdqpzc/)**

**Advantages**  
This coffee maker comes with a wide range of features that impressed me.  
- The dual brewing system opens the door to unlimited coffee choices. Whether you prefer K-Cups or fresh ground coffee, it's got you covered.  
- Brewing flexibility is another plus. I could easily brew either a 6, 8, 10, or 12-cup carafe depending on the crowd I was hosting. For my solo days, 6, 8, 10, or 12 oz. single cups did the trick.  
- The programmable carafe auto-brew is a game-changer for early mornings.  
- Pause & Pour is a thoughtful addition‚ÄîI could sneak a cup before the whole carafe had finished brewing without causing a mess.  

**Areas of Concern**  
While the Keurig K-Duo Special Edition delivers on most fronts, there are a few nitpicks worth mentioning.  
- Cleaning can be a bit tedious. The removable reservoir is convenient, but cleaning the nooks and crannies of the machine takes time.  
- It takes up vertical space, so under-cabinet placement might be an issue in smaller kitchens.  
- While the Strong Brew option is great, it‚Äôs only available for single cups, which might leave some carafe brewers wanting a bolder flavor.  

**Product Alternatives**  
In the world of coffee makers, competition is stiff. I tested a comparable model, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, which is also a dual-purpose machine. While it offers similar features, such as being able to use both K-Cups and ground coffee, it lacks the programmable feature that sets the K-Duo apart. The Ninja Coffee Bar is another rival offering versatility with its adjustable brew strengths, but its focus is more on single-serve capabilities and specialty drinks rather than large carafes. Where this Keurig machine shines is in its balance; it caters equally well to solo drinkers and large gatherings without needing multiple machines.

**Affordable Quality**  
Investing in the Keurig K-Duo Special Edition feels worthwhile, especially when you factor in its versatility. While it may sit at a slightly higher price point than some basic coffee machines, the additional features‚Äîlike the programmable carafe, Pause & Pour, and Strong Brew options‚Äîadd significant value. This coffee maker can go toe-to-toe with pricier specialty machines without breaking the bank. Its one-machine-to-do-it-all appeal makes it a strong contender in terms of cost-efficiency, considering the savings over needing a separate single-serve and full-carafe brewing system.

Years ago I bought a Rancilio Rocky used for $350 (probably close to $400 after shipping) for my espresso set up with a renewed Gaggia Classic Pro. I was very unhappy with it as I was never able to grind fine enough for most espresso. The best results I had were with incredibly dark roast coffee while grinding essentially at ""true zero"" (the burrs just barely touching and letting out a chirp sound). Even then I was still getting less than 30 second shots, and any coarser than true zero poured out the entire grams worth of espresso in 10 seconds. This continued even after buying new burrs assuming the issue was dullness. Sometime a year ago I bought a Fellow Opus that does the job wonderfully and the Rocky has sat in my garage since.

Fast forward to now, and a friend's birthday (who also happens to be an ex-barista and now home-barista) is coming up and I wanted to fix this up for her. She has an espresso machine but no grinder, so she's been using pre-ground coffee with her machine's pressurized portafilter basket. This needs to change and I figured I can re-home this Rocky. After researching the issues I had, I found that it wasn't some motor issue like I initially suspected but rather a QC issue with burr alignment and threading. I read several decade-old forum posts and even reddit posts in this very subreddit from as soon as 6 months ago looking for solutions and trying them.

I have the newer burrs I mentioned earlier. I did the teflon tape mod. I added aluminum foil shims until the burrs were parallel using the marker trick. NONE OF IT HAS WORKED.

I've spent the better part of 10 hours yesterday troubleshooting this to no avail. Going +1 above true zero resulted in a watery mess that dumps all over my scale every time without fail. The burrs are horizontally and vertically aligned. The teflon has stopped any rattling and slop present in the threading. I checked alignment with ths shims before and after the teflon just to be sure the addition of tape didn't mess up the alignment. Yet I'm unable to produce a drinkable shot. It seems no matter what I do I cannot get this grinder to actually grind. The one thing I haven't tested yet is the stepless mod, but if these mods aren't working at +1, then I am not sure how much the stepless mod can really help.

I am at a loss. I really want to fix this up to gift to my friend since my issues with the grinder seem to be common with other home baristas that have owned this. It feels repairable since the word from people who have done these mods seems to suggest that it made the grinder feel brand new and still get the machine to choke at +3 or +4 above true zero. I'm getting to the point where I want to toss this thing, but then I won't be able to gift it forward to a friend I really care a lot about who could get a lot of use out of this. And I also don't want the $400 ($450 after including the new burrs in it) I spent on this to be a complete waste. If anyone has ANY advice whatsoever please let me know.

This product offers a seamless way to indulge in Canada‚Äôs favorite coffee without stepping out of your house. I‚Äôve always appreciated the brand‚Äôs dedication to quality, so I had high expectations. Did it live up to the hype? Absolutely‚Äîbut not without a few caveats.

**Appearance and Packaging**

The coffee capsules come neatly packed in a sturdy box that emphasizes convenience. The first thing I noticed was the vibrant red and white Tim Hortons branding, which screams familiarity if you've ever visited one of their coffee shops. Each capsule is tightly sealed to preserve freshness, which is a big deal when you're aiming for that caf√©-quality experience at home. The packaging, however, is a tad bulky, and I did find it challenging at times to store it in my already crowded cabinet.

**Ease of Use**

Operating these pods with a Keurig brewer is simplicity itself. Sliding one into place and pressing that brew button takes seconds, and before you know it, you‚Äôre greeted by the rich aroma of their Original Blend. These pods fit perfectly into my Keurig device, which is great because compatibility issues can be a nightmare. You just pop one in, and there‚Äôs no fuss about coffee measuring or cleanup. However, I should point out that not every single pod seemed to puncture perfectly‚Äîthere were rare instances when a capsule leaked slightly during brewing.  

[Want Tim Hortons 1 Original Blend coffee at home? Check Amazon now.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07s9h32x5/)

**Flavor Profile**

What‚Äôs a coffee review without discussing the taste? Tim Hortons‚Äô Original Blend Medium Roast lives up to its reputation with a balanced flavor profile that‚Äôs neither too bold nor too light. It's exactly what you want when looking for a straightforward, no-frills cup of coffee. As a black coffee drinker, I found it smooth with minimal bitterness, but on days I craved a little indulgence, I added some cream and sugar to make their signature ‚ÄúDouble Double,‚Äù and honestly, it felt like I was back in one of their bustling cafes. However, if you're someone who prefers exotic flavors or darker, more intense profiles, this might not wow you.

**Consistency and Freshness**

One of the standout merits was how consistent every cup brewed. Whether it was a quick, energized morning or a slow afternoon break, the taste remained predictable (in a good way). It's worth mentioning that these pods do an incredible job of locking in the coffee's freshness due to the tightly sealed individual packaging. Even three weeks after purchase, I didn't notice a decline in quality.

**Advantages**

- Smooth, balanced medium roast perfect for black coffee or customized drinks like a ""Double Double.""
- Compatible with a wide range of Keurig brewers, making brewing effortless.
- Convenient, single-serve pods with sealed freshness.
- Offers a taste of Tim Hortons' signature coffee from the comfort of home.

**Negatives**

- Occasional leakage from capsules during brewing can be messy.
- Storage can be inconvenient due to the box's size.
- May not satisfy those pursuing niche or bold coffee flavors.

**Sustainability Practices**

Tim Hortons impresses with its nod to environmental awareness. The brand encourages consumers to recycle the pods if local recycling allows it, and they even suggest emptying the coffee grounds for alternative uses. While this doesn‚Äôt make the pods entirely eco-friendly, I appreciate the effort toward sustainability.

**Competing Brands**

In the world of single-serve coffee pods, there are a lot of heavy hitters. Starbucks, for instance, leans into bolder roasts and offers more diverse flavors. Their dark roast K-Cups are unbeatable for those days when you want something punchy, but they sometimes overshadow gentler blends that Tim Hortons excels in. Dunkin‚Äôs K-Cups, on the other hand, have a similar accessibility and focus on mid-strength coffees, but I find the Tim Hortons blend more nuanced and fresh-tasting. Meanwhile, brands like Peet‚Äôs Coffee cater to a niche by leaning extremely heavily into fair-trade, ethically sourced beans, which might make them preferable if sustainability is a top priority for you.

**Cost Efficiency**

For its category, these single-serve pods offer excellent value for the price. They bring the taste of a beloved coffee chain to your kitchen, saving you countless trips to the caf√©. Compared to some competitors, which can be astronomically priced despite offering the same convenience, you're genuinely getting your money's worth here. Of course, if you drink an absurd number of cups a day, the per-pod cost might add up, but in moderation, this is a worthwhile treat.

My wife and I are having our honeymoon in/around Cape Town over Christmas and New Year - we land on Christmas Day and we leave to go to Kruger on 7 January. We're from the UK, she's British and I'm Indian.

We have done our own research and made a rough itinerary but we would love some advice from locals too! We are like hiking, the outdoors, good food/wine and all the other cliches - we generally like to keep active during our trips.

We also have some more specific questions:  
\- Will shops/restaurants etc. be open on Christmas Day?  
\- Do you recommend staying in hotels or Airbnbs?  
\- What area within Cape Town would be a good base?  
\- Any specific markets, coffee shops, restaurants that you particularly recommend?  
\- Any good walks that are a bit more off the beaten track? We are aware the Christmas period is busy  
\- Anything we should know before renting a car?  
\- Any other general advice or comments?

Our rough plan is as follows:  
Days 1-5 in Cape Town  
Days 6-7 in vineyards e.g. Stellenbosch/Franschhoek  
Days 8-12 Garden Route  
Day 13 in Cape Town

1n5xxsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildfreeFriendships/comments/1n5xxsm/calling_all_european_women_29f/,Calling all European women ‚Äì 29F,"Hello peeps :) 

I'm a 29 yo cis woman from Central Europe looking for friends, maybe a small community. Maybe a small private discord with anywhere from 3-15ish women, maybe one on one contact on discord, depending on what comes of this.

I am looking for women somewhere in the age range of 25-35 from Europe, mainly for timezone reasons.

I'll tell you a little about me, and if you think we'd get along feel free to message me or leave a comment, ideally with some information about you, too.

I have degrees in linguistics and media design, and I am currently working on another degree in nutrition science. I work part time in a bakery and freelance as photographer amd media designer. I speak English, German, Danish, French, and I am learning Arabic and Spanish.

I am a very creative person, always slightly chaotic, doing many things at once. I love to cook, and I'd say 98% of the things I eat are plant based so I spend a lot of time experimenting in the kitchen. I am also actively following formula 1, since birth, basically. I love 60s-80s music, specifically Queen, Bowie, Annie Lennox, and the like and that is pretty much all I listen to. I have four dogs, who take up a lot of my spare time, sometimes if I have time I draw, I craft and play video games, but casually. I also read for fun, if I don't have a lot to read for university, mainly fiction, with a happy end. I used to be big into plants but somehow my green thumb is not as green anymore.

I am not religious and trust in scientific knowledge (including things like vaccines), it would be nice if you have the same perspective.

One thing that is pretty important to me is that I don't drink, I don't smoke, and I don't do any drugs (not even coffee), and I am not big on partying.

I am also a little awkward sometimes so I don't do well in huge groups, which is why I'm looking for/wanting to build a smaller community. 

Another thing is that I tend to get along better with (single) feminist women who are decentering men in their lives, women with no active plans to marry, because that is a different path through life. I am single and intend to remain that way so it would be too big of a difference in the long term. Oh, I am sterilised, so I'm definitely childfree for the rest of my life.

I think this should give you a rough idea of what I like, and who I am, and I hope to hear from you ‚Äì for filtering reasons, please tell me what your favourite fruit/vegetable is so I know you're a real human :)",3,1756754206.0,ChildfreeFriendships,1,0.8,False

In the past kids have often laugh at me in a patern and mocked me for some reason they have always have this creepy grin these are from strangers, there are some other asian kid,s but are often half white or 3/4 white and look white. however everyone who passes by me does this thing where they laugh, grin and mock at me when they get my attention. It is very creepy and they know it. I have started to think this is a racial thing, but my parents dismiss it. Am I crazy? I have asked my friend if I am for thinking this. she said I am not, but I wanted some further insight on this. One time a kid said I looked like a serial killer when I was very pissed off one time, and my parents blamed this for me of having a ""strict appearance."" I am not sure if this is race, but this also bugged me very much. Also I mentioned to my friend that one time a group of boys mocked me by laughing and pointing by saying ""look out! he looks like the main charecter!""

I‚Äôm writing this as a very discouraged and shocked dog mom. So my boyfriend and I recently bought a new home, and we all moved in together. Everything was fine. The boys were finally free roam and they had an entire home, and were doing so good. 

Saturday, it was hot out and the mosquitoes were relentless and Lenny(large dog aged 3) attacked Leo(mid size dog aged 6) out of the blue. We had to physically separate them and then reengage them slowly. They were fine overnight and slept in our bed as usual. 

Sunday morning, I‚Äôm drinking my coffee on the couch with Leo laying next to me. My boyfriend was outside and Lenny decided to come around to my other side to sit next to me, and Leo lunged at him and attacked him. At one point, Lenny put Leo‚Äôs head in his mouth without biting down, but holding it tightly, as Leo was trying to bite Lenny‚Äôs face. These are the only two incidents of my dogs EVER fighting. They play, they cuddle, they have been each other‚Äôs side kick for the last 3 years of them being together. 

I am so confused and my boyfriend and I have different work schedules so we‚Äôre not always home at the same time. They are both now kennelled while we are out of the house, and Lenny is now taking his fluoxetine again to reduce anxiety. Please help with any and all advice or ideas. It‚Äôs heartbreaking to see them act out like this and I have no idea what sparked either incident.

They can be in the same room with us if we both are in it, otherwise they go to separate areas but where they can still see each other. Their food bowls are next to each other, and Lenny would not eat until I moved his bowl to the other side of the pantry(legit 3 feet maybe). We are thinking that Lenny acted out maybe due to the heat, and Leo retaliated yesterday when he had the upper hand. Looking back on yesterday‚Äôs incident, when Lenny had his mouth around Leo‚Äôs head, he could have bitten or hurt him but he just held it. Lenny had marks and is missing fur on his face so we think that Lenny was holding Leo back in his own way? I don‚Äôt know, maybe I‚Äôm trying to convince myself that they will be okay again together.

As a typical American I would wear shorts and T-shirts at home but outside the house and going downtown in each country, I would buy clothing from each area where I lived to blend in with the population (which means in America businesses casual‚Ä¶   Because of respect)

Italy was harder and easier for learning the language.  Because everyone was willing to teach.  I spoke college Spanish at this Trattoria, the cook was from Argentina. He only spoke Spanish and Italian and I started out putting out a cup and I said cut in Spanish and he gave me the proper Italian term and then the Vincentino term.  My parents came to visit and I was a picture of three Tratter years, especially when they basically at this they were my Italian mother and father.  

And I was an American in military uniform getting gas and I asked for gas in Italian and this guy said ‚Äúoh you speak such beautiful Italian!‚Äù  I did not.  (I have probably murdered Italian because I was like three weeks in.) But he said I need to learn the Vincentino accent and would not let me leave until I was close‚Ä¶

I eventually ended up fluent in Italian except for things like science or technology 

Italy was absolutely wonderful and I am so thankful I was able to be there and it holds such great memories 

Sometimes when I dream, I will wake up and remember, I was dreaming about being in my house on the economy in the mountains

Germany: 

Part of my family is from Hanover journey and I actually have Steins from the 16 and 1700s and this special cabinet today and one of my father was shaving. He would teach me in German or when he was pissed off‚Ä¶ Like how to count to 20, or if he was pissed at me.  Then it was, ‚Äúcome here, sit down, shut up.‚Äù

Then one time I was with a German buddy in the passenger seat because we‚Äôre gonna go downtown to club and then get some great Greek food and I stopped for gas and I asked the gas station attendant for gas in German.  And the attendant just looked at my military license plate and he said in English, ‚ÄúOh just say it in English ‚Äú

I was kinda hurt because I was in my 20s and when I got back in the car, my buddy was laughing and I looked at him and I‚Äôm like hey did I like boss German and he said actually you have an accent from Lower Saxony.  And I said that‚Äôs too funny because that‚Äôs where my parents are from.

But he did say your German was just fine .   He also love the story of my father teach me German, and the first thing I learned was come here, sit down, shut up.    Lol. And I invited him and his wife to basically conspire against my mother so we could keep my father intoxicated at least 70% of the time.  

And I was watching enough to bring my parents over when I was stationed in Italy and they had an absolutely wonderful time. Everybody was wonderful.

And I was also able to fly my parents over to Germany and everybody was wonderful and they had a wonderful time.

Granted, we were respectful always, and always dressed appropriately.   We were guests.  

I remember waking up my parents and Germany at 4 AM and they were kind of upset with me, but I took them to this bread shop and we got fresh German black bread and we sat at the table outside and we put butter all over the black bread and we had coffee or my dad and I had coffee and my mother had tea and they‚Äôre like you know what we will never forget this. And I said oh yes, they know me I will show up and do this and they did not want to charge me because I introduced the owner and his wife to my parents and my parents were far more conversing in German than I was after living there for three years but I said oh no it can‚Äôt be free. I‚Äôll pay for it.

What good people 


Europe was safe back then.  The streets were clean. 

My six years in Europe were absolutely wonderful and I made so many friends and I had so many positive encounters‚Ä¶ the best time of my life

(as a caveat, I also have some stories about dealing with ugly Americans, and expressing my disgust at their behavior with people from their native countries.)  but the six years I spent in Europe was absolutely wonderful and I had a great respect for the cultures of Italy, Austria and German and also France.

I probably have 1000 other stories to tell about positive interaction with people in Europe and sometimes they were surprised I was in American and another time they could figure out I was an American, but I was dressed appropriately and acted appropriately 

Reading this sub, your countries are under attack and have been invaded and crime is rampant.   

I hope new politicians can be in by elected to get rid of this invasion and preserve the respective cultures.  

My father died last year and my mother has dementia. She is now in a memory care facility and the biggest topic we have is her visits with her husband to Italy in Germany because she remembers that clearly and it is a constant source of joy.  I bring pictures every day to relive it with her.  She forgets every day so every day it is a new source of joy for her.  And she will hold a picture and say I remember this place and she‚Äôll tell me details about the picture in like 360 around her that I don‚Äôt even remember.



Bless all of Europe, I hope the original culture can be preserved.

A Bit More About Me


I‚Äôm a storyteller at heart‚Äîwhether through books, music, movies, games, or late-night conversations. I love weird trivia, exploring overlooked places, and chasing good ideas.

I stay active in my own way: home workouts, nature walks, and travel whenever I can. I‚Äôve explored the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and the Bahamas. I also speak Spanish.

I notice the little things‚Äîyour favorite song, how you take your coffee, the way you light up when you talk about what you love. I care deeply, listen closely, and show up consistently.



What I‚Äôm Looking For


Someone playful, grounded, and emotionally present. Someone who loves to laugh, explore, and have thoughtful conversations. Someone unapologetically themselves.

I‚Äôm open to friendship, flirtation, or something more‚Äîwhatever feels real. Long-distance, age gaps, different backgrounds‚Äîall welcome.



Why You Should Message Me

If you want someone thoughtful, creative, and emotionally steady‚Äîsomeone who values kindness, depth, and a mix of silly and serious‚ÄîI‚Äôd genuinely love to hear from you.

No pressure. No expectations. Just curiosity.

I was driving through the Midwest, chasing daylight, when I realized I wasn‚Äôt going to make it to the next town before dark. Instead of pushing on, I took a small side road that led me past miles of cornfields. The sun was setting behind the stalks, throwing this golden light across everything, and I decided to just pull over and settle in for the night.

At first, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôd be comfortable. There were no other vans around, no people, just the sound of crickets and the occasional truck on a faraway road. But after cooking a quick dinner on my little stove and opening the back doors, the night actually felt peaceful. The moon came up, the air cooled down, and I realized I hadn‚Äôt felt that calm in weeks.

I woke up early the next morning to the sound of birds and the sight of fog rising over the fields. It was like a scene out of a movie. I sat there with my coffee in hand, doors still open, watching the sun burn through the mist, and it made me appreciate the stillness that van life gives you when you‚Äôre not rushing from one place to another.

It wasn‚Äôt glamorous, and technically it was just me parked on a dirt pull-off, but it ended up being one of the best nights I‚Äôve had on the road. I‚Äôm curious, have any of you had those random stops that turned out way better than expected?",4,1756753115.0,VanLife,1,0.83,False

Before taking a sip, think of one thing you want to manifest. Could be big (‚Äúmy dream client‚Äù) or small (‚Äúmoney for coffee today‚Äù). Keep it simple one focus at a time works best.

Step 2: Feel it
As you lift the glass, imagine the feeling of already having it. Excitement, relief, joy, gratitude whatever emotion matches that desire.

Step 3: Speak it
Either out loud or silently, say a tiny affirmation like:
	‚Ä¢	This desire is already mine.
	‚Ä¢	I drink in abundance.
	‚Ä¢	Everything I want flows to me easily.

Step 4: Sip with intention
Take the water in slowly, imagining it ‚Äúfilling you up‚Äù with that energy literally hydrating your body and your manifestation.

Bonus tip: Keep a cute water bottle with a sticker that says ‚ÄúManifest & Hydrate‚Äù visual reminders make the habit stick.

I love this take as it keeps you hydrated and i love water! i always feel gratitude that i am able to turn on a tap in my home and have water. others aren‚Äôt so lucky.

About 70% of you is water, which is wild when you think about it. Every cell, organ, and system depends on it to function. 

Translation for manifesting: if water carries energy, intentions, and vibes (yes, scientifically and spiritually), then you‚Äôre basically a walking manifestation machine.

The car is insanely quiet now. I can cold start the car in my garage and not hear it in the house. I hear the road noise more than I hear the exhaust.

It took a second to get used to not having that exhaust note to know when to shift, but after already knowing the car this change didn't take long to adjust to.

The car feels better too. I can't really explain why. But it feels smoother. And it feels a little more zippy on the low end. I'm confused because I was expecting to lose a bit of power and pep going from the Comp RS Catback to the stock 2nd gen but it turned out to be the opposite. I was expecting there to be more back-pressure. Though admittedly I need to refresh my knowledge on exhaust flow.

And psychologically it's exponentially better. I no longer have a loud exhaust screaming in my ear 24/7. And idk if the conditions were just right and this was a coincidence but I had no problems with traffic either. I was able to cruise at 5 over the entire time which I have *NEVER* been able to do in my 2 years of driving this 200 mile loop twice a month. I *""feel""* like maybe it was because nobody is focused on my loud car. But I don't exactly believe correlation equals causation here so we'll see how this goes in the future. But even driving around town had the same effect which is also unprecedented. Maybe it was as I said above, where nobody is distracted by the loud car, maybe it's in my head where I'm more relaxed due to not having a loud exhaust in my ear and thus I don't care how traffic behaves and I'm not constantly trying to get around people, maybe it's both. Just thought it was worth mentioning. 

Gotta say this was worth all the effort. I'm happy to finally hear my music again. I'm happy to not have that feeling of waking up my kids or my neighbors kids every time I want to go get a coffee. I feel more at peace with this setup, as weird as that sounds. 

For those that asked for a sound clip, I'll get one eventually. I didn't see y'all asked until I got home. I'll try to get one the next time I go out. Forewarning though it's nothing special. It's so quiet I wonder if I can even get a good clip. Hell I think my stock Civic LX is louder lol.",4,1756752822.0,ft86,5,1.0,False

I do gig work only. And I don't bother with small events. It only works with big events.

(all numbers are without VAT)

If I have 8 hours of sales, all day a line, non stop making coffee, I make \~950‚Ç¨ revenue. I don't think much more is really possible atm.

My average this year is \~770 per day, last year \~560

So this is a graph which shows my net per day on the y axis (after substracting all costs) dependant on the yearly revenue (x-axis). Costs include only costs of doing business (my wage is not included). Basically the number before personal tax, health insurance and social contributions and stuff is applied (for the IRS it's basically like gross salary I have to pay personal tax on).

[https://imgur.com/a/oi-KMxPDDF](https://imgur.com/a/oi-KMxPDDF)

I don't think way more than 770 average is possible, and I need to be really picky with gigs for that.

So basically if I can keep my 770 average, I can't go higher than 450/day; 550 average is no more than 320/day; 350 average is no more than 200 per sales day.

And it needs to cover my other work like finding gigs, and all other overhead.

I'm not that mobile that I can hit on multiple locations a day

My cart is really small so I can't offer much else

Hours are long

From the top of my head I wouldn't know a location which would be profitable to during normal hours

Like RN I'm thinking more about keeping my recurring gigs, optimize it for chill work days (like weddings and corporate events) and then trying to start something else with higher glass ceiling or no glass ceiling at all. Or do you think it's solid for a side gig?

Like my issue is that I don't really want a side gig, I want actually something which could develop into something better

After churning out words for a few hours, Rick went out for his second stroll of the day. There was a smile plastered across his face‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt one of satisfaction but one of relief. He hadn‚Äôt written anything particularly well, but he was relieved to have written anything at all, and that was because of what had happened in the morning, before his first walk.

After forcing himself to get out of bed early in the morning, he had made scrambled eggs and coffee. Then he carried both to a mahogany table where his laptop lay. He used a knife to eat the scrambled eggs because it was the only clean utensil he had at the moment. After finishing his breakfast, he turned to his laptop almost immediately, like a tiger noticing its prey for the first time. Pushing the knife, plate, and cup to the corner of the table, he took a deep breath and opened his work-in-progress novel.

His face scrunched in concentration accentuated the wrinkles he‚Äôd been awarded with for slaving years at an unfulfilling job. Those years had made him age decades. Sleep-deprived eyes darted back and forth, reading the previous day‚Äôs work, noticing the errors he had made. Almost without his will, his hand started to edit the previous day's work. It was like the hand was a foreign being, with a volition of its own. He almost had to physically restrain his hands and bring them under control.

As the time slipped by, sweat erupted from every pore of Rick‚Äôs body, all while unpleasant thoughts ran rampant through his mind. Self-doubt crept into his lap like a past lover, one he knew he should stay away from, knowing it would only end terribly. At first, he could have shrugged it off him easily, but he almost craved its familiar feel. How it caressed him. How it consoled him. How it urged him to leave for greener pastures. Soon, the time to act had passed, and it had nestled into deeper places than Rick‚Äôs lap, solidifying itself. Still, he stared stubbornly at the laptop screen. Sometime later, good sense strolled by him almost on pure chance. It offered him a hand as if it were a sailor and Rick a drowning child. Rick grabbed the hand, and it led him outside.

He walked for an hour. The morning sun mercilessly targeted him as if it had a personal vendetta against him. He frowned at the shabby houses in the neighborhood, laden with cracks and mold. He clicked his tongue at the sharp gust of wind prickling his face, and he thought of it as an obstacle, pushing him back from his goal of walking forward. He desperately searched for something pleasant to look at, something beautiful. But he failed, and his mood deteriorated further. While everything around him *was* unpleasant, unbeknownst to Rick, it had made no difference. He hadn‚Äôt known that even if Helen of Troy had teasingly brushed past him, his mood would never have improved. For how a man perceives himself is how he perceives the world.

So it was that when he went for a second stroll, after successfully writing for a few hours, and having fully wrought himself from the clutches of self-doubt, everything felt as different as different can be. Even though the afternoon sun was shining more mercilessly than ever, Rick thought they had come to a silent reconciliation. When he ran his hands through the cracks of the passing building, he could only marvel at the intricacies of the mundane, how each centimeter of the crack was a subtly different feeling on his hand. Even the humid wind felt liberating. It almost caressed his face. Now, even though it was a bigger gust of wind than before, and more of an obstacle, he felt it was the gentle push of a dear friend, cautioning him of the dangers that lay ahead. Even though it was anything but gentle, Rick thought otherwise.

When he came home, Rick jumped as he saw something moving from the corner of his eye. The man in front of him also jumped into a sideways position, protectively raising a hand towards Rick.

‚ÄúWho the fuck are you? What are you doing in my house?‚Äù Rick said. Seeing the tall man with crusty black hair, hazel eyes, and a jaw forged from an anvil, he felt he was familiar in some way.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, man. I just woke up at your house.‚Äù The tall man said, straightening himself, and only then did Rick see the other side of his body, and saw his right sleeve flaunting helplessly. Rick let out a horrible gasp.

\#

The man stood up from the mahogany table and pushed aside the laptop from which he‚Äôd read the novel Rick had been writing. As he stood, he slouched as if the whole world was resting on his shoulders. But even slouched, he was noticeably taller than Rick.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fucking believe this.‚Äù The man whispered, almost to himself.

‚ÄúI think this manuscript is indisputable proof of‚Ä¶‚Äù Rick said placidly, as if convincing a child Santa wasn‚Äôt real.

‚ÄúOh, to hell with your manuscript. Do you know how it feels learning your whole existence is a lie?‚Äù The man said on the verge of hysteria, cupping his face in his singular hand.

‚ÄúI am just as baffled as you. Honestly, Alexander, I would have taken it so much harder if I‚Äôd come to know I wasn‚Äôt real.‚Äù Rick prodded.

‚ÄúI *am* real!‚Äù The man shouted, anger contorting his handsome face.

‚ÄúStories aren‚Äôt real. So how can a character from a story be real?‚Äù Rick asked, further fanning the flames of Alex‚Äôs anger. But he had fanned too much, and the flames burst out of Alex, causing him to charge Rick. They both toppled to the floor, wrestling like maniacs.

While Alex was taller and bigger than Rick, the lack of an arm was too much of a handicap, and the gap could not be bridged by a few extra inches and a couple of pounds. So after a brief scuffle, Alex accepted his defeat and sat on the floor, destitute and broken. All anger left him, and sadness filled its place. He began to cry.

‚ÄúYou maimed me. You took my arm.‚Äù Through the tsunami of tears, Alex let out a bone-chilling wail. It would have broken even the toughest of men, but not Rick. For he was a God, and Gods do not break.

‚ÄúOh, Alexander, do you even know what I have planned for you? Imagine how wonderful it would be for you to come out on top *despite* being crippled. This monumental challenge will make the fruit of your triumph all the sweeter!‚Äù

‚ÄúGod, why would you think I‚Äôd want that? Nobody would. Why not just give me triumph from the get-go? No conflicts, no challenges, just happiness.‚Äù¬† He pleaded. It was not a child‚Äôs plea but the plea of a man who had been wronged and demanded justice.

‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs boring!‚Äù

‚ÄúBoring to live, boring to read, or boring to write?‚Äù Alex asked accusingly.

¬†‚ÄúAll of them. An unchallenging life is not worth living. It is not worth reading, and *certainly* not worth writing.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you believe in God?‚Äù He asked after a pause.

‚ÄúI know what you‚Äôre trying to do. But that‚Äôs different. A God who knowingly makes the lives of living beings challenging and full of suffering is no true god at all.‚Äù Rick scoffed. ‚ÄúI did not know you were living, so I cannot be held accountable for making you suffer. If God exists, then he has to know he is making us suffer because a God, by definition, knows all things. So if he does not know he is making us suffer, then he is no God at all.

‚ÄúYou were my God. And you did not know. So why do you think he knows? What if God does not know he is making you suffer? What if he does not know you are living beings? Even if he does, what if he thinks a life devoid of suffering is not worth living? What if he thinks an unchallenging life is not worth living? What if he thinks it is not worth reading, and *certainly* not worth writing?‚Äù Alex‚Äôs mouth curved into a ghastly smile as he eyed the knife lying on the mahogany table.

Rick realized that if he were God, then Alex was the devil. After all, it was God who had breathed life into Lucifer.

He‚Äôs totally in love with me, really gentle and protective. We clicked immediatelly after the first date which is not usual for me as I am generally quite reserved in the beginning and only let very trusted people into my space, so really from the start everything about this man seemed perfect and I really dont know a girl who has such a wonderful boyfriend who buys gifts every day and cooks for her and does everything for her without her even asking. I could literally call him at 3am asking him to come from the other part of the city to come give me a glass of water and he would do it without hesitation. He is also the first guy that genuinely liked me and just loves the way I look naturally, I could wear a clown costume and he would still think i‚Äôm the most attractive girl in a room full of models. Okay now finally getting to the not so great part, I think in some ways I am getting emotionally abused. I don‚Äôt want to throw the term so easily but honestly it‚Äôs just the way I feel. So, I will give you some examples of what he does, I could go on a night out, dressed totally modest and go with friends he already knows, all girls, and he would make me feel so bad for going. I remember once he got so angry with me because I went to have coffee with a female friend and I didnt want him to come with me. He either makes me feel bad for going or invites himself too. Number two, I lost nearly all my friends because of this, I get invited and dont go, I lost so much of my energy on explaining that i just started to ghost people and obviously now everyone hates me and I dont have friends anymore. Number three, in the past i would go out and he would spam my phone with missed calls and messages, making me anxious all night instead of enjoying myself, i havent enjoyed a night out since i was 19, and havent been on one in like 7 months probably. He isolated me from most of my friends, i only hang out with him and he‚Äôs the only person left in my life. The reason its so hard for me to end the relationship is because of the first paragraph where i stated how amazing this guy is in every way when we are alone and nobody else is involved, I genuinely enjoy my time with him, it‚Äôs never boring, he plans dates n stuff, even just sitting in the car and talking feels amazing. He‚Äôs so great with kids and I could see him being the father of my children, as he is responsible too. I dont think i could ever again find a guy like him, usually guys only look at my looks and dont really care about who i am inside, but he is different. Its not about my beauty to him but about my humor and creativity and conversations. I wish i could fix him just a little bit, i totally lost myself in this relationship and i feel like im a part of him now, it got so toxic that every day after uni when friends would ask me to stay and study i would need to say no i need to go back to my bf cause he‚Äôs coming back from work and if im not there he might get mad. And he‚Äôs not physically violent we just fight a lot verbally. Sometimes he does admit and reflect on what i said, but its rare. He gives me zero space and even if my going to the toilet to sh*t and i take my phone to play videogames he will make a whole drama about me going to the toilet with my phone and hiding something. He constalty is paranoid that im hiding stuff. I never did anything for him to not trust me‚Ä¶ i dont want to lose him, but if i stay i pretty much could lose myself‚Ä¶ breaking up also feels impossible cause it will feel like hell and also i will hurt him a lot with this‚Ä¶ i want to work on us but i dont think controlling people like him can change.

# GM-4: Game Mistress Environment ~ by Sphiratrioth

Welcome to the new age of roleplaying. No more repetitive starting messages, no more fixed scenarios. LLM becomes your Game Mistress in a tabletop RPG like style roleplay. Choose a world to roleplay in, choose a setting and a story genre you want and jump right in. The LLM will start a scene for you and push the story forward - in line with a selected setting & genre. Time of day/night & weather for a current scene will be rolled, one of 50+ locations that match and become filtered by a setting will be randomly selected or you can choose it yourself (city, countryside, fantasy, sci-fi). Highly customizable roleplay experience without editing the once finished cards nor any additional hassle.

**Permissions: you are allowed to use it and generate your own remixes or versions of the GM-4 format, worlds & scenarios. However, if you upload your creations online - you need to give me credits and attach a link to this exact repository. All the creations must be clearly credited as using GM-4 Environment by Sphiratroth.**

# What is it?

GM-4 format cards are just the normal V2/V3 character cards but with custom, especially crafted lorebooks to activate the environment (\~900 entries) and with a custom sysprompt to load within SillyTavern. When you trigger a given scenario/setting/genre of your roleplay through normal chat, the instructions in the lorebook will be sent to the LLM without appearing in chat but the starting message for a roleplay scene will be generated - different each time. Since it follows precise instructions from a lorebook, the starting message always reflects your choice so the scenario remains consistent but the starting message and the small surrounding details change. No roleplay feels the same - even for the same scenario. There is no boring repetition. On a top of that - different scenarios may be mixed. For example, if you want the scene to start in a sci-fi cyberpunk world world, you can keep it SFW, you can turn it NSFW or you can even add a supernatural horror/hunting flavor to it. You do not need to edit a card itself, you do not need different variants of the same card - it is all in the universal lorebook.

In other words - everything matches everything and anything may be picked up freely or rolled. I am a game designer for AAA games studio, I do it for living - I make stories and games in a modular form - thus - my roleplays also look and work just like that.

# What it does?

* it becomes your game mistress - it generates the story & pushes it forward but you can do whatever you want in a given setting world;
* it generates a different starting message - every single time (no more repetitive roleplays);
* it automatically randomizes time & weather for a current scene;
* it makes it possible to select a specific, setting-matching location or it rolls it for you randomly (we all know that ""your journey starts at the inn..."" trope and the LLMs love it the same as real Game Masters do - thus - it is better selecting or rolling a location each time);
* it allows picking up all those options from a normal chat window (no need to edit a character card itself, no need for multiple versions of the same character);
* it guides characters in a specific way druing roleplay - to improve the experience (for instance, stops the LLM directly repeating what {{user}} did in {{char}}'s response, which personally - infuriates me);
* it does not require any extensions nor special knowledge - just picking up the intuitive trigger words from the convenient lists presented in alternative starting messages (but you roleplay in the default starting message only - all the rest just serves as an easy way of presenting the options to choose from);
* it allows randomly rolling almost all the available options or to choose, which ones you want to roll - for more fun and even less predictability.

# How is it different from other solutions out there?

I'm fully aware of similar solutions that have been developed separately and at the same time as mine (this is a fourth version, I released the first ones the previous summer) - but all of those alternative solutions do not give you a freedom nor flexibility that my approach offers. Also, you do not need ANY extensions nor any settings adjustments to use my environments. It works out of the box, just like that. Only lorebooks required - and lorebooks are a native tool of SillyTavern - so why shoot at flies with a tactical nuke when all needed is already there? To be honest, I've also tried all the alternate extensions & environments in hopes that they would be better and that other people will simply do all the work for me so I can sit, roleplay and enjoy - but I have never been satisfied with those solutions - not because they're bad or worse - not at all - they're just not flexible and not modular - so - to my honest disappointment, I had to work on the new versions of my own environments. Now, it's all at v.4 so SX-4, GM-4, CG-4 and as previously, I'm hoping it will be the final version but who knows :-P As stated before - await the SX-4 and CG-4 release soon. It may be tomorrow, it may be within the next 2 weeks - depends on my job :-P

# How to set it up?

**Download all the filest in the repository:**

1. Navigate to the files section of this post and download the files.
2. Choose the AIO version or the modular version. AIO includes NSFW and it is just one lorebook to activate in SillyTavern. Modular version allows selecting separate modules freely but you need to activate more lorebooks. BEWARE: DO NOT MIX THE AIO AND THE MODULAR LOREBOOKS!
3. Import the lorebooks, the GM Character & the GM sysprompts in SillyTavern.
4. Activate the lorebooks: Framework \[AIO\] + Scenario lorebooks or Framework \[MODULAR\] lorebooks + Scenario lorebooks.
5. Select the Game Mistress character.
6. Navigate to the alternate starting messages to check the list of all the available options and their trigger words.
7. Optional: after deciding what you want to roleplay, you can also activate one of the additional ""World"" lorebooks to make the roleplay experience better.

**Roleplay:**

1. Return to the DEFAULT STARTING MESSAGE. BEWARE: THIS IS THE ONLY MESSAGE WHERE YOU START YOUR ROLEPLAYS. ALL THE ALTERNATIVE STARTING MESSAGES ARE JUST THE TRIGGER WORDS LISTS - FOR CONVENIENCE. DO NOT ROLEPLAY THERE!
2. Type in the trigger words you want. You need a scenario/setting at minimum, you can add the location if you want (and it is highly suggested).
3. Hit ENTER - the actual starting scene/message for a roleplay should be generated. If LLM makes a mistake and does not jump right into the world of your choice but blabbers somethihng to continue the scene with a Game Mistress and you setting up the roleplay, just swipe and see what happens.
4. Roleplay for a while to have a more consistent experience. It is known that after a couple of roleplays, my environments get better.

# Tips & Tricks

* always roleplay in the default starting message. If you edit it, just remember that it needs to include a suggestion/set-up for roleplaying - so the LLM understands instructions from a lorebook properly and generates the actual starting message for a roleplay.
* edit the scenarios & other interesting things within the framework and scenario lorebooks;
* you can turn the options on & off by changing the value ""trigger"" from 0 to 100 to turn something on and from 0 to 100 to turn something off. This way, you can permanently select something for your roleplays and turn all the rest off. However, you will still need to use the trigger words if they're defined within the trigger words field. If you want to just always roleplay in a given setting, change this setting's activation to a ""blue dot"" and delete the trigger words, then set all the other entires within the group Trigger values to 0.
* some things may be triggered with a full word or with a ""quick trigger"" like fantasy: 01 vs F: 01; see the scenario lists in the alternate starting messages for more information on what can be triggered and how. It is very convenient and intuitive!

We would love to stay in the greater Bay Area/Northern California but ideally somewhere we could rent a 2+ bed house with some outdoor space for ~$3,300/month and maybe eventually afford to buy a home one day ($600-$700k ish) rather than paying $3,300/month for our one bedroom city apartment and feeling priced out of eventual home ownership.

We work remotely and make ~$250k combined. We want to prioritize access to nature, but would love some decent restaurant options, coffee shops, fitness studios as well. Ideally there would be a decent community of people in their 30s to make friends. We both have Wisconsin roots and spend most of the summer months at a family lake home in northern WI, so staying in CA where winters are mild is important to us, though we have considered the Denver area as it‚Äôs closer to home and we have plenty of friends there.

I began to follow it and I finally experienced some relief. When I ate simply and excluded FODMAPs it wasn't perfect but it was workable, livable even. I was still having issues however and sought another GI as well as help with my diet.

This new GI ran a great many tests, vitamin panels, parasites, celiac, elastase, etc. I began to follow the FODMAP diet religiously. I would slowly attempt to incorporate foods, and if I had a bad reaction I would label the food as bad and not eat it again. Eventually I had some semblance of control, but it was fickle and random sometimes. It seemed that it often didn't matter what I ate, and I began to think maybe it is not the food, maybe it is the system.

I began attempting to regulate my system. I started with box breathing daily. For the first time in years I found real relief, not much, but a start, a lever I could pull. The box breathing helped me reduce urgency. I would do box breathing after eating to calm my system down. I realized I was hyper-focused on any sensation in my stomach. I practiced feeling the sensations and not holding on to them. Once I realized that I was doing this to myself, I began to cycle FODMAPs instead of excluding them.

The same way you would use progressive overload in the gym, I used on FODMAPs. I realized that the more I attempted to protect my system, the more it needed protecting. You do not build stronger muscles by lifting lighter weight. You do not strengthen your mind by ignoring complicated ideas. Why would my stomach be any different?

I cycle my FODMAP consumption. I eat safe foods until my stomach is settled. Then I begin to add FODMAPs to my meals throughout the week, garlic and onion in seasonings, cruciferous vegetables, etc. I found that I can handle these things and that a little discomfort is okay. I began to push boundaries as far and as fast as I could to test my limits. I would end my FODMAP cycles effectively maxing out, eating 8 servings of broccoli, making pasta sauce mainly out of garlic and shallot, eating large amounts of apples or cherries. I push until I get symptoms, then I go back to chicken, rice and carrots until I am good again. Then I start all again.

I have also been breaking my fear of needing to be next to a bathroom. In the morning I will drink cold brew (220mg of caffeine), take a nicotine lozenge, and then get as far away from a bathroom as possible. I have also purposely consumed BBQ beans and onion rings the night before a flight in order to stress test my symptoms. I have found the more I push and expose myself to, the more robust I become.

I‚Äôm not cured, but I‚Äôve made substantial progress. For the first time in years I finally feel alive again. I don‚Äôt fear food anymore, and I don‚Äôt fear being in places without a bathroom nearby. These days I can wake up, drink my coffee, and head out the door without a second thought.",4,1756752279.0,ibs,0,0.76,False

I would love to get your opinion on the best layout for my one-room apartment. I've been trying to figure out the most functional and comfortable arrangement, and I've created three mockups (A, B, and C) to visualize the options.

The furniture I need to fit in the space is:

A bed

A desk

A TV

A low-profile, Japanese-style sofa

A coffee table (which will also be my dining table)



A few important notes on the mockups:

The furniture dimensions are approximately correct, but the actual style/design of the furniture is just a placeholder. The floor color is accurate.

To clarify the room's features:

The glass door leads to a balcony.

The main wooden door leads to the rest of the house.

The two narrower doors are a built-in closet.



I have two main questions for you:

Which layout (A, B, or C) do you think works best and why? I've also included a blank ""Option D"" for any completely new suggestions or improvements you might have.

I'm also undecided on the wood color for the furniture. Based on the floor, do you think a lighter or a darker wood would look better?

When I was 16 my mom came out as a lesbian. At first it was a shock, but then it felt right. She told my dad before me and my sister (who was 21, 27 now) so we didn't see his reaction but he was incredibly accepting. Having so much love for my mum, he just wanted her to be happy. Thats not the unique part, that part is that they stayed married and decided not to divorce. They're separated and date other people but still live under the same roof.

It started off that way because when I was 16 I was going through tough exams and they didn't want to change home too much (mums idea), so it just kinda stayed? To be honest it did help, and whilst at first it felt different but quickly everything fell into place. They decided divorce was such a lengthy process, and they get on so well, really best friends, it wasn't really like much had changed, only that my dad stayed in the guest room. They decided that if either of them got in a serious relationship, then they'd divorce, but still live close to each other.They started dating other people pretty soon after. Ironically my dad got more dates than my mum, turned out her single friends always had a thing for him lol which we even joked about before. Anyway thats a long way to say they were happy living with each other and not being divorced. Sometime in the past month my dad called me, inviting me out for a movie. I was confused, because my parents go on friend 'dates' like twice a month to go see a movie, turned out she'd blown him off. When I got there my dad talked about how my mum was acting weird, she was ignoring him a lot. This worried me, so I called her to meet up.

I met up with my mum over coffee and asked if she was alright. She acted odd and brushed it off, before I mentioned stuff with my dad. She acted weird again, and then straight up laid it on me that she was 'finalising the divorce.' Shocked, I asked her why, and asked if she'd found someone and she said she hadn't, then said 'isn't it weird we're still married? There‚Äôs no point' I guess I hadn't thought about that, but still, it was odd and random. She also discussed her plans to move to a city 5 hours away from us, which in the UK is a big change.

I called my sister straight after I got home, telling her about it, worried about our dad, and she said 'oh she finally did it'. Confused, I asked her what she meant, and she said something like 'aren't you embarrassed? Don't your friends find it weird they're still together?' and that our dad should ‚Äòget a grip‚Äô. I lost it. I asked why a 27 year old woman would give a shit about something like that, and called her heartless because she knows our dad is still in love with our mum, even though it's harmless and he just wants her to be happy. Our mum is also very introverted and will hate moving. But I want to know, am I doing this just because I want my parents to be together?

Until now, we have been selling to third-party exporters, but we are now seeking to connect directly with roasters, importers, distributors, or brands interested in sourcing directly from the origin. We are passionate about supporting local farmers, sharing the rich flavors of Vietnam, and building long-term partnerships with buyers worldwide. 
The primary coffee varietals are Robusta and Arabica. Robusta is typically cultivated at elevations around 1,000 meters, while Arabica is grown at higher altitudes, where cooler temperatures enhance flavor development. We have also sourced some Catimor from farmers, although not in significant quantities compared to Robusta and Arabica. There are several processing methods for coffee, including the honey process, washed process, and natural dry process. Coffee is mainly grown by smallholder farmers who utilize traditional cultivation methods. The region's fertile soil and favorable climate contribute to the production of high-quality coffee beans. Many farmers adopt sustainable practices to maintain soil health and promote biodiversity. 
- Robusta Coffee: Robusta coffee is known for its strong, bold flavor with notes of dark chocolate and a lingering aftertaste.
- Arabica Coffee: Arabica coffee Ha offers a clean cup with bright acidity, floral notes, and a smooth body.

If you are in the coffee or spice industry (or know someone who is)I would love to connect, share samples, and explore potential collaboration opportunities.

I (29F) have been with my boyfriend (28M) for 6 years. There‚Äôs a rumor he‚Äôs about to propose and instead of feeling excited like everyone expects, I just feel dread.

I do love him. He‚Äôs sweet, funny, hardworking, and honestly one of the kindest people I‚Äôve ever met. He cooks, cleans, takes care of me, and everyone I know thinks he‚Äôs amazing. He does things like leave me notes, plan picnics, or bring me coffee when I‚Äôm stressed. He remembers little things I mention and will surprise me with them later. People say he‚Äôs a true romantic. And while I know that stuff is thoughtful, sometimes it‚Äôs not what I pictured for myself. Like for our last anniversary he made me a scrapbook, which was really sweet, but then I see my friends posting jewelry or trips from their husbands and boyfriends and it‚Äôs hard not to compare.

We met in college. I grew up in a wealthy suburb and my parents paid for everything, tuition, housing, extras, so I graduated from a university in Massachusetts with honors and no debt. He grew up in Massachusetts too and went to the same school, but he had to work part time and take out loans just to scrape by. I walked out debt free, he walked out already buried. At the time I thought it didn‚Äôt matter.

After graduation I moved back to Indiana. We did long distance until he eventually left everything in Massachusetts and moved here for me. Before that he was living with four roommates just to afford rent. Everyone thought it was romantic that he gave all that up, but honestly sometimes I resent it because now I feel like I‚Äôm stuck here too.

Indiana is objectively a terrible place to live. The politics, the lack of opportunities, the general vibe‚Ä¶ idk, it just feels like there‚Äôs nothing here. I‚Äôve wanted out for years. I work fully remote now so I could move to Chicago tomorrow. It‚Äôs only three hours from my family and has everything I want. But he refuses because his job is fully in person here. On top of that, he makes significantly less than I do. I know some people are fine with non-traditional dynamics, but I grew up expecting the man to provide, and I really struggle with the fact that I earn way more than him. To me it feels like I‚Äôm compromising while he won‚Äôt.

We live together in an apartment downtown. It‚Äôs nice enough, but nothing fancy, and I pay most of the rent since I make a lot more. It feels like another reminder of the gap between us.

Financially we‚Äôre just in completely different worlds. I make a six figure salary and support myself. Yes, my parents have helped. They bought me my car, paid for my education, and gave me money for a house down payment. I haven‚Äôt touched it because I don‚Äôt want to use it on a small starter home with him. Most of my friends‚Äô parents helped them too, so in my circle it doesn‚Äôt feel unusual.

He was raised by a single mom. They even lived in shelters at times. His mom is clean now and living with a relative, but they never really recovered financially. He‚Äôs still drowning in debt. It‚Äôs not just student loans, but also credit card debt, medical debt, personal loans, and some random old bills that keep resurfacing. His car barely runs. He chips away at it but it feels endless. And I‚Äôve noticed he always grabs the mail first thing when it arrives. I can‚Äôt help but wonder if it‚Äôs because he doesn‚Äôt want me to see how bad things really are.

My family has always tried to bridge the gap. Whenever we went on vacations they made sure to include him. He‚Äôs been on trips with us to the lake, Disney, even overseas. But those were my family‚Äôs resources, not his. If he proposes, the ring will not be what I want. His family can‚Äôt contribute to a wedding, so my parents would have to cover everything again.

And it‚Äôs not just the big things. He doesn‚Äôt like expensive restaurants. He doesn‚Äôt splurge on gifts. He‚Äôs not going to surprise me with big gifts or a trip to Europe like I see with my friends. He honestly thinks love and stability should be enough. But I grew up watching my dad provide everything for my mom, and I always thought I‚Äôd have the same.

So that‚Äôs my dilemma. He‚Äôs amazing in so many ways, but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôd be marrying down. I don‚Äôt want to be stuck in Indiana forever, tied to his debt, and limited by a life I never pictured for myself.

At the same time, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the AH and I shouldn‚Äôt be punished for being honest about what I want. I worked hard, graduated with good grades, built a good career, and was raised with certain expectations. Maybe that makes me selfish, but at least I‚Äôm self aware enough to admit it. I know he tries his best, but sometimes his love just doesn‚Äôt seem like it will be enough.

AITA for wanting to leave the most amazing man I‚Äôve ever met just because of his debt and the way he was raised?

1n5wufw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnboxedOpinions/comments/1n5wufw/should_you_trust_howard_lemon_oil_wood_polish_for/,Should You Trust Howard Lemon Oil Wood Polish for Furniture Care,"Testing out Howard Products LM0016 Lemon Oil Wood Furniture Polish has been a genuinely pleasant experience. I was drawn in by the promise of a product that combines cleaning and polishing in one step, and I‚Äôll admit, I‚Äôve put it through its paces. Specifically designed for wood surfaces, this lemon-scented polish seemed perfect for everything from the antique dresser I inherited to my modern kitchen cabinets. I wanted to see how well it stacked up against previous wood polishes I've used, and whether it could live up to its reputation as a must-have for furniture care.

**Enhancing the Look of Wood Surfaces**

One of the immediate benefits was how the product brought out the natural beauty of the wood grain. My old oak coffee table, which had seen better days, was revitalized in a matter of minutes. The polish not only enhanced the wood grain but also gave it a natural shine without feeling overly glossy or artificial. Whether I used it on sleek honey-toned furniture or deep walnut finishes, the formula adapted beautifully. The absence of streaks or greasy residue made the process incredibly satisfying.

[Check Howard Products LM0016 price on Amazon.](https://review.sanue.com/p/b00ewlbno0/)

**The Role of the Lemon Scent**

The light citrusy aroma felt like a bonus for anyone sensitive to strong chemical smells. Each time I opened the bottle, there wasn‚Äôt that unpleasant solvent-like odor common with some wood cleaning products. Instead, the lemon scent was subtle but pleasant enough to make the cleaning process somehow more enjoyable. It leaves this faint aroma that lingers for hours, giving my home a fresh feel.

**Protecting Against Drying and Fading**

Another highlight of using this polish was its ability to nourish and protect the wood against drying and fading. I tested it on a set of bookshelves that sit next to a large window and are frequently exposed to sunlight. The polish helped restore a slightly dull finish while leaving a protective barrier that seemed to strain light exposure. Over time, I hope this will minimize fading, but even based on short-term usage, it seemed proactive in combating dryness caused by environmental factors.

**Suitability for Different Wood Surfaces**

This versatility was a feature I did not expect to appreciate as much as I did. Howard Products LM0016 works just as well on vintage dressers as it does on everyday-use kitchen cabinets. It‚Äôs clear this product is formulated with both finished and unfinished wood surfaces in mind. I even experimented with it on wooden chairs and light scuff marks on my dining table, and it managed to restore a noticeable level of smoothness while minimizing those small but bothersome blemishes.

**Highlights**

- Enhances wood grain for a natural, elegant glow.
- Subtle and fresh lemon scent makes cleaning more enjoyable.
- Prevents wood from drying and fading over time.
- Compatible with both finished and unfinished wood pieces.

**Critiques**

- Requires consistent reapplication for long-term results.
- Not as effective on deeper scratches or very old, worn-out surfaces.
- Could benefit from a nozzle or sprayer for easier application.

**Industry Competitors**

In terms of similar products available, a widely recognized competitor is Old English Lemon Oil. While equally effective as far as a fresh scent goes, I found this one left behind a slightly heavier residue compared to Howard Products LM0016. Meanwhile, some furniture polishing sprays I‚Äôve used in the past felt more commercial and less nourishing for the wood itself, focusing more on temporary shine. Howard's formula seems better suited for both preserving and enhancing the luster of the furniture. On the other hand, products like Orange Glo offer a quicker application process but feel less versatile overall.

**Affordable Quality**

For its results, I feel like it delivers excellent value in furniture maintenance. Cheaper brands often miss a crucial step: deeply nourishing the wood while simultaneously cleaning it. Whether you consider the restoration of aged furniture, the revitalization of dull cabinets, or simply the convenience of a 16-ounce bottle that lasts through multiple uses, it‚Äôs hard to argue with its overall value.

Salam brothers and sisters, not sure if this is the proper subreddit but I tried muslimlounge and they removed it for being marriage related, which I don‚Äôt really think it is, but oh well. 

my wife‚Äôs sister is a lost person and I do not want her to have any contact with my family. She was recently working at some coffee shop, ended up meeting this guy (allegedly Muslim, but his actions speak otherwise), she would essentially be dating him while at work because he would stay there for hours while she was working chatting with her and even holding hands. Eventually her brothers and parents found out and in an attempt to break it off sent her to live with her other sister 3 hours away and took away her devices.

She must have still had a secret phone or something because that guy drove to where she was when no one was around and took her and they basically ran away together. This is a major disgrace and embarrassment to our entire family and I do not want any form of contact with this woman, she is disowned as far as I‚Äôm concerned. My question is after all this, if I am islamically allowed to ban my wife from speaking to her anymore? I do not want anything to do with this woman and I certainly don‚Äôt want her anywhere near my children or wife, I don‚Äôt want them to have the idea in their head that you can do whatever you want, your family will be mad for a while but in the end  will just forgive it anyway so no harm.

My partner and I are from the states where it sucks ass right now and we're spending a year in Melbourne. We just signed a lease for the year in a beautiful little apartment in st. Kilda 20 mins from the beach. It's already clear we aren't going to be able to extend it because we have a work and holiday visa and we're nowhere near the zip codes to do farm work out in the bush to get another 2 years max, not that I'm built for farm work anyway. I love it here, the people, the culture, the weather, the nature. I love everything, from walking down the shores looking towards Tasmania to walking into Cole's for some coffee and bread. I just want a quiet life with a menial job where I can enjoy my hobbies in a beautiful country that cares for it's citizens.

However, in the states, I'm too poor to go to university, too rich for the financial aid, my grades in high school weren't good enough for academic scholarships cause I stopped caring after the first year. In a perfect world I could travel to the country I want to live in regardless of borders and assimilate with the people there but in this day and age I need a specific work visa, which I'm wholly unqualified for. A student visa, which I can't afford for the same reasons as in America, or a partner visa with my SO. They just graduated college last year with an art degree but it's already nearly impossible for Aussies to find art jobs here, let alone immigrants. 

Not that a lot of Aussies even want immigrants judging by the showing at the protests the other day. I even made sure to check my options with an asylum visa and even though I'm an lgbtq autistic person on medication, I am not actively persecuted yet like so many others so I couldn't even morally bring myself to apply for that even if I did qualify. 

I plan on coming back here some day probably when I'm much much older but even then if I lived my life and tried to retire here I wouldn't have a Super or anything saved up like the rest of the old Aussies would and I would still be at a huge disadvantage unless I managed to amass a ton of wealth over my life. I'm 24 now and I don't know if I'll ever get to live here with a small life and no specialized career all because I made the unforgivable mistake of being born somewhere else. 

Last paragraph I promise, but there really is no where else in the world like Australia and I'm gonna miss it here dearly. Sorry this is more of a venting rant than a question but I am still genuinely looking for advice or at least what actual Aussies thoughts are on this perspective from an outsider. I'm trying to enjoy the rest of my time here but every day I go out now I just feel a pang in my heart of exclusionary ""you're not a part of this"" feeling like your looking at the popular kids table in grade school or I'm having the worst case of FOMO I've ever felt.

My ex, who has BPD, is moving to the city I came to get away from her. It‚Äôs been over nine months since we last spoke. The last time we did, she wanted to do a video call just because she was ‚Äúcurious,‚Äù after about eight months of no contact. That hurt me a lot. She had no regard for my feelings at all.

Today, I was in my room enjoying my day off. Tomorrow is my birthday, which always makes things worse because of how our relationship ended. I was playing some video games on my new laptop when my phone vibrated. I got a notification from Bumble saying someone wants to meet me. I opened it up and it was a picture of my ex. My heart sank. She was only three kilometers away.

Out of bad judgment, I swiped right to see what she wanted. She immediately sent me a voice message on WhatsApp saying she was in San Sebasti√°n for a job interview. I replied, trying to set boundaries: ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre doing okay, but I‚Äôm not interested in being just friends. I hope you understand.‚Äù She hasn‚Äôt replied.

What makes it even more particular and painful is that she lives in Madrid. This is not just a casual coincidence. She‚Äôs actively coming to a city I moved to in order to heal and get away from her. Now she‚Äôs appearing on Hinge, Tinder, and Bumble, and I‚Äôm worried she might actually move here. I don‚Äôt understand her motivation.

I feel it‚Äôs incredibly cruel and insensitive. I‚Äôm afraid I might see her on the street, see her with someone else, and it‚Äôs just going to hurt. I was doing fine. I thought I was healed, but now I feel like all of that progress is threatened. It doesn‚Äôt feel fair, and I just don‚Äôt know how to protect myself emotionally.

I don't want to move from here I was finally happy and independent thoughts of jelousyx heartbreak were no longer... and now its coming back

""Lily, you must marry that comatose man James in place of my daughter. This is what you owe the Ginger family! You‚Äî""  
  
""I will.""  
  
Lily‚Äôs reply made her foster mother gasp in disbelief. ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù  
  
Lily could understand her shock. After all, in this massive capital city, who didn‚Äôt know how madly she was in love with John Jones? She‚Äôd loved him so much she‚Äôd given up her future, her dignity‚Äîeverything.  
  
She had refused her foster mother many times before, all because of John. Her foster mother clearly hadn‚Äôt expected her to actually agree this time‚Äîto marry a total stranger who lay in a vegetative state.  
  
Calm and numb, Lily repeated, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it.‚Äù  
  
Once it was clear Lily was serious, her foster mother let out a breath of relief before snapping at her again. ‚ÄúOne month from now, the Luke family will register your marriage with their eldest son. They have decided on that day, and it's final. Someone will come to pick you up for the wedding that day. I‚Äôve already accepted the bride price from the Luke family. It‚Äôs what you owe the Ginger family, and I‚Äôm not giving it back. If you dare go back on your word or stir up trouble, I will...‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI won‚Äôt,‚Äù Lily cut her off coldly.  
  
‚ÄúThe Luke family is rich. I trust the bride price was generous. You took me in from the orphanage and raised me for sixteen years. Now I‚Äôll take your daughter‚Äôs place and marry into the Luke family. That settles my debt to you and the Ginger family. From now on, we owe each other nothing.‚Äù  
  
With that, she hung up.  
  
Sitting quietly at the dining table, Lily couldn‚Äôt help but reopen the news article she‚Äôd just seen.  
  
It was everywhere‚Äîvideos of John and Elsa Quinn‚Äôs wedding flooded the internet, dominating the trending charts.  
  
In the video, he and Elsa stood hand in hand, surrounded by their friends, vowing to spend their lives together.  
  
The entire internet was offering their blessings, rejoicing that the two had reunited and wishing them a lifetime of happiness.  
  
Everyone except Lily.  
  
Because John was her boyfriend‚Äîthe man she had loved with all her heart.  
  
Four years ago, he‚Äôd been paralyzed in a car accident. The cold-hearted Jones family had abandoned him, and Elsa had gone abroad and married someone else.  
  
Back when Lily was being bullied, he was the one who had pulled her out of it.  
  
She had loved him in secret for so long. On that freezing, snowy night when he had tried to end it all, she brought him home.  
  
She did everything she could to take care of him, to lift him out of the darkness one step at a time.  
  
She‚Äôd heard about a hospital overseas that could help him walk again. To raise the money, she sold her blood, became a punching bag for rich people, ending up with three broken ribs‚Ä¶  
  
She suffered endlessly, but finally, two years ago, she scraped together enough for the surgery.  
  
It was a success. He could walk again. He kissed her and promised he would treat her well for the rest of his life, that he would never let her down.  
  
She had believed that everything they‚Äôd been through was finally behind them, and from then on, it would all be smooth sailing.  
  
She never expected things to fall apart the moment Elsa came back.  
  
Word had it Elsa was gravely ill and only had six months to live. Her last wish was to marry John.  
  
He couldn‚Äôt bear to see the woman he once loved suffer, so the wedding Lily had spent six painstaking months preparing became Elsa‚Äôs.  
  
The wedding dress Lily had sewn with her own hands‚ÄîElsa wore it.  
  
The diamond ring John had custom-ordered for her‚ÄîElsa wore it on her left ring finger.  
  
Through blurred vision, Lily saw a pendant around Elsa‚Äôs neck.  
  
She recognized it instantly.  
  
It was the keepsake her parents had left her.  
  
She had lost it while trying to save John.  
  
He had once told her he found it and would give it to her on her birthday.  
  
But now, just because Elsa had said she liked it‚Ä¶ he gave it to her instead.  
  
Suddenly, Lily realized there was no point in loving someone like John.  
  
She didn‚Äôt call him. Didn‚Äôt beg him to come back.  
  
She simply lit the candle on her birthday cake and stared blankly as it slowly burned down. The whipped cream cake melted into a mess‚Äîjust like her love for John, which had burned to ash overnight, leaving not a trace of warmth.  
  
It was nearly dawn when John finally came home.  
  
When he saw her sitting at the dining table with red eyes, clearly having stayed up all night, his brows furrowed tightly.  
  
‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt you gone to bed?‚Äù  
  
Lily ignored his question and said calmly, ‚ÄúJohn, let‚Äôs break up. And tell Elsa to return my parents‚Äô keepsake as soon as possible.‚Äù  
  
John immediately understood‚Äîshe must‚Äôve seen the news about his wedding with Elsa and was feeling jealous.  
  
He didn‚Äôt like it when women got jealous over nothing, but he had never once thought of leaving her. So he softened his voice.  
  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be mad. I didn‚Äôt forget your birthday. This is your gift.‚Äù  
  
He opened a sleek burgundy velvet jewelry box in front of her.  
  
Inside lay a pink diamond necklace.  
  
The exquisite gem shimmered under the light. The centerpiece‚Äîa pink diamond the size of a pigeon‚Äôs egg‚Äîsparkled brilliantly.  
  
It was far more expensive than the pendant her parents had left her. But it wasn‚Äôt what she wanted.  
  
Just like how she no longer wanted him.  
  
John knew better than anyone how deeply Lily loved him, how she couldn‚Äôt live without him.  
  
When she stayed quiet, he thought it meant she was done throwing a fit.  
  
He reached for the necklace, intending to put it on her.  
  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want this necklace! I just want my parents‚Äô keepsake!‚Äù  
  
Lily slapped the necklace away and said stubbornly, ‚ÄúThat pendant was left to me by my parents. How could you give it to Elsa? I only want that pendant!‚Äù  
  
*Still throwing a tantrum...*  
  
John‚Äôs patience snapped.  
  
His chiseled face turned cold and hard, like it had been carved from ice, filled with a sharp, suffocating pressure.  
  
‚ÄúElsa really likes that pendant.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs so sick‚Äîhow much longer do you think she‚Äôll even get to wear it? Why must you fight over something with someone who's already dying? Lily, when did you become so selfish and heartless?‚Äù        



**Chapter 2 She Bloomed Like a Rose and Entangled Him Without Mercy**



*Selfish. Cold-blooded. Fighting a dying woman over a pendant‚Ä¶*  
  
But that pendant was hers‚Äîleft to her by her parents. What was so wrong about wanting it back?  
  
Did he really expect her to keep sacrificing everything for him after being betrayed so completely? Was she supposed to grovel after being humiliated like that?  
  
*She wasn‚Äôt that pathetic.*  
  
Before she could even say a word, John‚Äôs phone rang shrilly.  
  
It was a call from Elsa.  
  
Her voice was weak and pained. ‚ÄúJohn, I just threw up blood. I feel awful‚Ä¶ Can you come be with me?‚Äù  
  
John paused.  
  
He hadn‚Äôt even managed to calm Lily down yet.  
  
But he figured Lily would never really leave him, and Elsa was already seriously ill. So he made his decision.  
  
‚ÄúElsa, don‚Äôt cry. I‚Äôm on my way.‚Äù  
  
Hearing her choked sobs, he didn‚Äôt bother explaining to Lily anymore. He turned around and left the room without looking back.  
  
As the front door slammed shut, Lily let out a cold laugh and kicked the diamond necklace into a corner.  
  
It had been like this ever since Elsa came back a month ago.  
  
Every time Elsa felt a little uncomfortable or upset, he would drop everything to run to her.  
  
Rain or shine, day or night‚Äîhe was always there for her.  
  
It was like all those sweet whispers he‚Äôd once murmured to Lily, all those promises of eternal love, had been nothing but a dream.  
  
But luckily, it was all about to end.  
  
In one month, she‚Äôd marry James.  
  
Then John could stop worrying about her clinging to him, and go be happy with his precious crush. What a perfect outcome.  
  
Funny thing was‚Äîher wedding day would be on John‚Äôs birthday.  
  
His birthday, her wedding. Two celebrations on the same day. *Poetic, really.*  
  
As far as Lily was concerned, once she broke up with John, he was no longer her boyfriend. She had no reason to stay in his villa.  
  
And it just so happened to be a Sunday. She spent the whole day packing everything she owned.  
  
She sold what she could, tossed the rest.  
  
She‚Äôd contacted the biggest luxury resale company in Capital City. The staff came straight to her door, and her used bags and jewelry sold for a total of twenty million.  
  
She didn‚Äôt transfer a cent to John. She kept it all.  
  
She earned that money. It was hers.  
  
As night fell, Lily shredded the last tie she‚Äôd ever made for John, threw it away, and returned to her room.  
  
She was just about to leave with her suitcase when she noticed the photo on her nightstand.  
  
In the picture, she leaned against John‚Äôs shoulder, smiling brightly. He was gazing down at her with what looked like affection.  
  
John had always hated taking photos.  
  
This one was taken on her birthday last year, after she begged and pestered him nonstop. It was the only photo they had together.  
  
She had treasured it like gold.  
  
As soon as it was printed, she placed it on her nightstand and looked at it every single day. Even on business trips, she would take it with her.  
  
Now, all she felt was mockery.  
  
She smashed the frame against the floor and tossed it in the trash.  
  
‚Ä¶  
  
By the time John came home, it was late at night.  
  
He parked in front of the main house and immediately noticed the living room was dark.  
  
The sight made him vaguely uncomfortable.  
  
He often came home late from social events.  
  
But no matter how late it was, Lily would always leave the lights on for him.  
  
That single light in the night had always guided him home. So before Elsa returned, he had never once stayed out all night.  
  
He figured Lily was still sulking.  
  
Knowing her, she was probably curled up on the couch waiting for him to coax her.  
  
‚ÄúLily.‚Äù  
  
He snapped out of his thoughts and walked quickly into the living room, flipping on the lights.  
  
To his surprise, she wasn‚Äôt there.  
  
She wasn‚Äôt dozing on the couch like usual, struggling to keep her eyes open after waiting so long, ready to stumble into the kitchen and make some ginger tea for him.  
  
The living room felt‚Ä¶ emptier.  
  
He couldn‚Äôt quite put his finger on what was missing, but it felt cold.  
  
‚ÄúSir, you‚Äôre back.‚Äù  
  
Hearing him, Mandy rushed out of her room. ‚ÄúDid you drink, sir? I‚Äôll make you some ginger tea.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo need.‚Äù  
  
John wasn‚Äôt in the mood. He rushed upstairs and headed straight to Lily‚Äôs room.  
  
She wasn‚Äôt there.  
  
The room itself was empty.  
  
The potted plants by the windowsill were gone. Even her pillows and bedding had vanished.  
  
The space used to be so cozy‚Äîplush toys, crystal bead curtains, whimsical wall stickers‚Ä¶  
  
Now, it was nothing but cold black and white.  
  
The sterile atmosphere irritated him.  
  
He turned around and asked Mandy in a chilling voice, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Lily?‚Äù  
  
His presence was so cold, it made Mandy shiver.  
  
She drew in a deep breath before answering honestly, ‚ÄúMiss Lily said‚Ä¶ she broke up with you. And that she‚Äôs not coming back.‚Äù  
  
John was stunned into laughter by the nonsense Lily had left behind.  
  
*So she was still throwing a tantrum?*  
  
*Running away from home?*  
  
*She really thought she had guts now, huh?*  
  
‚ÄúMandy, leave.‚Äù  
  
Once she was gone, John dialed his assistant Wayne, face still cold, and ordered him to find out what hotel Lily was staying in.  
  
She had no family in Capital City. In such a rush, she couldn‚Äôt possibly have found a proper place to live.  
  
Running away in anger‚Äîshe could only have gone to a hotel.  
  
Wayne worked fast. It didn‚Äôt take long before he confirmed she was at Capital City First Hotel.  
  
‚ÄúLily, how long are you going to keep this up?‚Äù  
  
John typed the message into the chat app‚Äîbut then he stopped.  
  
And deleted it.  
  
Because he realized the photo frame on the nightstand was gone.  
  
He knew better than anyone how much Lily had treasured that photo.  
  
Even if she was throwing a fit, she must have taken it with her. No way she‚Äôd just walk out for good.  
  
He didn‚Äôt need to message her.  
  
Four years ago, the Ginger family kicked her out. Her biological parents had died when she was six. She‚Äôd had no home since then.  
  
If she didn‚Äôt come back to him‚Äîwhere else could she go?  
  
Since Elsa returned, they‚Äôd argued countless times.  
  
And every single time, she was the one who apologized first.  
  
*This time would be no different. It was only a matter of time.*  
  
‚Ä¶  
  
In the month since Elsa came back, Lily had been plagued by so many negative emotions that she hadn‚Äôt had a good night‚Äôs sleep.  
  
But now that she was free of that cage, she slept like a baby.  
  
Packing up the day before had drained her energy. Her calves were sore and aching‚Äîshe really wanted to stay in bed.  
  
But it was a weekday. She had to go resign from Jones Corp.  
  
All those years with John, she‚Äôd built her life around him.  
  
When he was struggling, she worked herself to the bone to pay for his treatment. After he became successful, she became his personal assistant and cared for him in every detail.  
  
Now that she was done with him, there was no reason to keep that job either.  
  
She wanted to chase her childhood dream‚Äîto become a great voice actress.  
  
‚ÄúLily, my stomach hurts so bad, I can‚Äôt hold it anymore!‚Äù  
  
Lily had just arrived at the secretarial department when the new girl, Yulia Xander, ran up to her in a panic.  
  
Yulia looked absolutely pitiful. ‚ÄúMr. John needs this file urgently. Can you please bring it to the CEO‚Äôs office for me?‚Äù  
  
She was clearly in crisis mode.  
  
Before Lily could even agree, Yulia had already dashed off toward the restroom in a very awkward pose.  
  
Lily didn‚Äôt want to see John.  
  
But it was obvious Yulia was desperate.  
  
She had a good impression of the girl and didn‚Äôt want her getting chewed out by the boss. So she took the file and headed for the CEO‚Äôs office.  
  
The door was slightly ajar.  
  
Lily raised her hand to knock‚Äîthen froze.  
  
She heard Elsa‚Äôs coy, flirty voice.  
  
‚ÄúJohn, my ankle suddenly hurts so much!‚Äù  
  
Her hand hovered over the door, then lightly pushed it open a crack.  
  
Through the narrow gap, she saw Elsa‚Äôs body suddenly go limp‚Äîand fall into John‚Äôs lap.  
  
‚ÄúElsa‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
John seemed startled and instinctively grabbed her waist, probably afraid she‚Äôd get hurt.  
  
But even after regaining her balance, Elsa didn‚Äôt move.  
  
She hooked her arms around his neck, bright and alluring like a rose in full bloom.  
  
‚ÄúJohn, I suddenly want to kiss you. What should I do?‚Äù  
  
As she spoke, her dewy red lips slowly pressed toward his‚Äî  
  
And John didn‚Äôt move away.       



**Chapter 3 Spiraling, Unraveling, Lost in Her Wake**



""Lily...""  
  
Wayne Hunter had come to the CEO's office to give his report.  
  
Most employees at Jones Corp had no idea about Lily and John‚Äôs relationship.  
  
But Wayne, trusted by John for years, knew everything.  
  
Seeing Lily, he instinctively greeted her‚Äîonly to catch sight of what was happening inside the office.  
  
He froze, horrified.  
  
Then quickly slapped a hand over his mouth.  
  
He looked at Lily, his eyes full of awkwardness and sympathy.  
  
""Elsa, I‚Äôm sorry.""  
  
John had been momentarily distracted, stunned for a good ten seconds before he quickly pulled away from Elsa.  
  
""I'm not blaming you,"" Elsa said coyly, cheeks flushed. ""My shoelace came undone.""  
  
Hearing that, Lily‚Äôs dull gaze dropped to Elsa‚Äôs shoes.  
  
Elsa was stunning.  
  
Bright, bold, beautiful in an almost aggressive way.  
  
Today, she wore crisp designer white sneakers, paired with a white blouse and a pleated pink skirt. Youthful and radiant, she looked exactly like a campus sweetheart.  
  
John didn‚Äôt say anything.  
  
But his actions spoke louder.  
  
He gently lifted Elsa onto the desk, then knelt to tie her shoelace. His movements were so careful, they almost looked reverent.  
  
Watching his long, elegant fingers slowly and intently tie the lace, Lily couldn‚Äôt help but remember something.  
  
Back then, when their love was still new, he had once said to her, *‚Äú*Lily, meeting you is the happiest thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me. I‚Äôll protect you, treasure you, never let you suffer. Never betray you.‚Äù  
  
She had believed him with all her heart, like a fool, thinking she was the luckiest girl in the world.  
  
One day, while they were walking hand in hand, they saw a guy bending to tie his girlfriend‚Äôs shoelace. She‚Äôd snuggled into John‚Äôs arms and teased, ‚ÄúWould you tie mine if it came undone?‚Äù  
  
He had answered that it was pointless to compare things like that‚Äîtoo childish.  
  
It was obvious what he meant: no, he wouldn‚Äôt.  
  
John was like a cold, distant mountain capped with snow. She thought his aloofness made sense‚Äîit wasn't in his nature to stoop for something so small.  
  
As long as she had a place in his heart, it was enough.  
  
But now, seeing him so tenderly kneeling for Elsa, Lily finally understood. Love could win anyone over if their love was with the right person.  
  
All his so-called principles, all his ‚Äúcan‚Äôts,‚Äù were never about principle.  
  
*He just didn‚Äôt love her.*  
  
And that was fine. They would both start new lives.  
  
It was fine.  
  
She stood outside the door, quietly watching as he tied Elsa‚Äôs laces, then began to massage her ankle.  
  
Watching the way they looked at each other, the unspoken affection sparking between them...  
  
She watched as the boy she had once loved so deeply blurred into a vague, unfamiliar shadow.  
  
When Elsa threw herself into John‚Äôs arms again, Lily didn‚Äôt linger.  
  
She turned and walked quickly toward the stairwell.  
  
""Ms. Lily!""  
  
Wayne had seen everything Lily had done for John over the years.  
  
The moment she turned to leave, he ran after her, worried.  
  
Normally quick with words, he found himself at a loss. That scene just now had been too damning. He didn‚Äôt know what to say to comfort her.  
  
Pushing his gold-rimmed glasses up his nose, he finally spoke awkwardly. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt read into it. Honestly, the boss still really loves you. The last time you two fought, he got drunk and kept calling your name. He‚Äî‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWayne, I‚Äôve already broken up with John.‚Äù  
  
Lily knew Wayne meant well, but she didn‚Äôt let him finish.  
  
Ignoring the shock in his eyes, she continued, ‚ÄúHe loves me? He loves me, so he married Elsa on my birthday? He loves me, so he‚Äôs tangled up with her like that, unable to let go? That kind of love‚ÄîI don‚Äôt want it. Wayne, I‚Äôve already written my resignation. Please sign it when you have a moment.‚Äù  
  
Wayne was the head of the secretary department. Lily didn‚Äôt need John‚Äôs signature to quit‚Äîbut she did need his.  
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really sure about this? Does the boss know?‚Äù  
  
Wayne had always been loyal to John.  
  
He didn‚Äôt want John getting back together with Elsa, not after she abandoned him when he was at his lowest.  
  
But after Elsa came back, he saw how John had treated her, and he knew it wasn‚Äôt fair to Lily.  
  
Deep down, Wayne understood‚Äîleaving John might actually be the best thing for her.  
  
That night, John got drunk after arguing with Lily; he hadn‚Äôt just called her name. He‚Äôd insisted she was his wife. When Elsa came in, John had pushed her away.  
  
Wayne knew John felt guilty that Elsa was dying.  
  
But somewhere along the way, he‚Äôd fallen for Lily too.  
  
Still, not wanting to make a move without permission, Wayne decided to speak with John before signing anything.  
  
‚ÄúMs. Lily, you‚Äôre giving this directly to the boss? I‚Äôll bring it to him. I‚Äôll talk to him first. If he agrees, I‚Äôll sign it.‚Äù  
  
Lily had wanted to finalize her resignation as soon as possible.  
  
But she didn‚Äôt want to make things difficult for Wayne. She handed over the file and returned to her office to wait.  
  
Even if John didn‚Äôt approve it, she wouldn‚Äôt be coming in tomorrow.  
  
She liked finishing what she started, but there was no point dragging out something that no longer mattered.  
  
‚Ä¶  
  
That afternoon, after confirming Elsa had left, Wayne went to John‚Äôs office.  
  
As soon as he stepped in, he saw John‚Äôs face was thunderous.  
  
‚ÄúBoss‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWho made this coffee?‚Äù  
  
John glared at the cup on his desk like it had personally offended him.  
  
Wayne instantly understood what was going on.  
  
He hadn‚Äôt signed Lily‚Äôs resignation yet‚Äîbut she‚Äôd already given up and stopped working.  
  
The coffee John used to drink was always brewed by Lily herself.  
  
Wayne had tasted it before‚Äîso good that even top baristas would struggle to replicate it.  
  
Compared to hers, anyone else‚Äôs brew might as well have been sewage. Of course John hated it.  
  
Wayne swallowed hard and said honestly, ‚ÄúBoss, it wasn‚Äôt Ms. Lily. She just‚Ä¶ she submitted her resignation. Should I sign it?‚Äù  
  
*Resign?*  
  
John‚Äôs expression darkened even further.          



**Chapter 4 They All Forced Lily to Apologize to Elsa**



As if realizing something, John let out a cold laugh.  
  
So that‚Äôs what this was‚ÄîLily was throwing a tantrum and threatening him with a resignation. Playing hard to get, was she?  
  
He knew better than anyone how much she wanted to be his personal assistant.  
  
She‚Äôd buttered him up for days just to land that role.  
  
If he really approved her resignation, she‚Äôd be the first to panic.  
  
She needed a lesson‚Äîto understand she had gone too far this time.  
  
‚ÄúSign it.‚Äù  
  
After letting out that icy aura, John added coldly, ‚ÄúAnd when you do, tell her‚Äîif she resigns, she better never come back.‚Äù  
  
Wayne shrank his neck.  
  
He wanted to say Lily seemed completely determined this time, like she never intended to come back at all.  
  
But the killing intent radiating from John was too terrifying, so he kept quiet.  
  
He just nodded and respectfully went to sign off on her resignation.  
  
‚Ä¶  
  
Once Wayne signed, Lily quickly completed all her paperwork and left the company.  
  
Almost the moment she got back to the hotel, a message came in from John.  
  
‚ÄúCome to Flora Club.‚Äù  
  
Flora Club‚Äîthe place John always took his friends for drinks and parties.  
  
Lily had broken up with him. She had no intention of going.  
  
She was about to refuse when another message followed:  
  
‚ÄúIf you still want your parents‚Äô keepsake, be in front of me in half an hour.‚Äù  
  
Lily desperately wanted to get that pendant back. She didn‚Äôt dare delay and rushed to Flora Club.  
  
Inside the private room, Elsa and several of John‚Äôs close friends were already there.  
  
When Lily pushed open the door, she immediately saw John seated in the center of a deep red leather couch, Elsa curled up beside him.  
  
Elsa lifted her chin proudly, striking and radiant as ever.  
  
John sat protectively at her side, every movement full of tenderness and care.  
  
Lily felt a sharp sting behind her eyes.  
  
But she had come for a reason. She swallowed the bitterness and stepped inside.  
  
‚ÄúApologize to Elsa!‚Äù  
  
The moment John saw her, he slammed his glass down at her feet.  
  
‚ÄúHow dare you send thugs after Elsa to steal the pendant? If Simon hadn‚Äôt happened to pass by and save her, she would've been assaulted by those animals!‚Äù  
  
His friends all jumped in, shouting their indignation.  
  
‚ÄúHey, you, that was too much!‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWe get that you‚Äôre jealous of Elsa, but this? You can‚Äôt just send people to attack her!‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúApologize to Elsa now. Maybe if she lets it go, John will still forgive you!‚Äù  
  
*Elsa‚Ä¶*  
  
Lily stood frozen, face pale.  
  
She‚Äôd loved John so much. She had gone out of her way to be nice to his friends, always trying to fit in.  
  
But in all the years she was with John, not one of them ever called her by name. Their attitude had never even been respectful.  
  
She used to think they were just arrogant and blunt by nature.  
  
But hearing the way they now fawned over Elsa, she finally understood‚Äîthey had never lacked manners. They simply knew John didn‚Äôt truly care about her. She wasn‚Äôt worth respecting.  
  
But Elsa‚Äîdespite having betrayed John four years ago‚Äîwas cradled in the palm of his hand. So now, they all worshiped her too.  
  
‚ÄúLily, apologize to Elsa!‚Äù  
  
John‚Äôs cold voice snapped in her ear. Lily snapped out of her daze.  
  
She hadn‚Äôt done anything. Of course she wouldn‚Äôt admit to something she didn‚Äôt do.  
  
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt send anyone to hurt Elsa. I‚Äî‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThose thugs said you were behind it. Elsa wouldn‚Äôt lie!‚Äù  
  
John cut her off without letting her finish. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll say it one more time. Apologize.‚Äù  
  
*Elsa wouldn‚Äôt lie‚Ä¶*  
  
Lily almost laughed out loud.  
  
*So if Elsa said something, it was the truth? But when I spoke, it was all lies?*  
  
Even if he loved Elsa more, after four years together, shouldn‚Äôt he know what kind of person I was?  
  
Shouldn‚Äôt he trust me, just a little?

Anyone else had to restart?,"I don't know what came over me this morning but I just didn't care. I managed to take pics but then no exercise, reading or sticking to my diet. I can't believe just a day or two ago I was thinking this is the new me and that I'd finally cracked the code to losing weight. 

I wasn't prepared for real life. Two things came up that were super stressful and upsetting and I clearly wasn't prepared for how to work this around this. So yeah... I spent the day at home feeling sorry for myself, doom scrolling and eating ice cream, French toast, etc. 

I was really tempted to just lie and pretend that today didn't happen as it's hard to go back to day 1 but what's the point in doing this if I don't do it properly? I will keep doing this even if I have to keep restarting until I do it right and see it through. 

The good thing is that day 1 - 6 were so helpful in terms of getting me back into exercising and reading. I hadn't done either of the two for way too long. I'm finally comfortable with going to the gym and swimming pool by myself which is great. I was doing really well so screw the past, let's go!

  
Mistakes not to repeat - 

No eating out (even if I think it's healthy they add salt/sugar to it which then sets off my cravings).

Start the day with reading and exercise otherwise I go into sloth mode.

No energy drinks or coffee.

After about two weeks we had agreed to meet up for coffee. The thing is, he didn‚Äôt show up. He had been texting me that morning and I hadn‚Äôt thought to remind this grown-ass man that we had a date planned.
I got there early and waited for 35 minutes past our meeting time before I left.

Do I give him another chance? I haven‚Äôt confronted him about it yet and he left my last text message on read. ",1,1756751120.0,askgaybros,1,0.66,False
1n5wj6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatItsLike/comments/1n5wj6g/showcase_forcefield_fabric_cleaner_for_upholstery/,Showcase ForceField Fabric Cleaner for Upholstery Does It Deliver,"The ForceField 2022 FAB CLNR has been my daily go-to for tackling stains on everything from my living room upholstery to the occasional coffee mishap on my favorite rug. As someone who values a clean, inviting space but doesn‚Äôt love spending hours scrubbing, I was curious about whether this cleaner could live up to its professional-strength promise. Spoiler alert: it did‚Äîbut it‚Äôs not without some quirks.  

**Design and Usability**  
This fabric cleaner comes in a straightforward, ergonomically-designed spray bottle that fits comfortably in your hand. The 22-ounce size feels generous without being cumbersome to handle. The spray nozzle delivers a fine mist, ensuring even coverage over stains without drenching the fabric. Its compact dimensions make it easy to store under the sink or in a corner cabinet, a minor but valuable upside for those of us with limited storage space.

**Performance on Stains**  
After spending a few weeks putting it through its paces, I‚Äôm impressed with how the ForceField cleaner delivers on its claims of handling both oil- and water-based stains. My toddler managed to grind chocolate ice cream into our beige couch, and much to my amazement, this product lifted it out entirely. It also worked wonders on an old ketchup stain on a dining chair cushion that had resisted multiple cleaning attempts.  

[Find the best price for ForceField 2022 FAB CLNR on Amazon.](https://info.sanue.com/p/b008eujbm6/)  

**Good Aspects**  
- Works effectively on challenging stains like oil and food-based spills.  
- Suitable for water-safe fabrics such as carpets, rugs, and upholstery.  
- WoolSafe approval adds confidence for use on delicate carpeting.  
- Doesn‚Äôt leave any residue or cause discoloration.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The smell, while not overpowering, has a slightly chemical undertone.  
- For larger areas, you may find yourself needing a second or third bottle depending on frequency of use.  
- While the packaging is functional, it‚Äôs not the most aesthetically pleasing if you care about how products look sitting out.

**Other Options**  
When compared to other well-known brands like Scotchgard or Bissell SpotClean, the ForceField cleaner stands out for its ability to simultaneously tackle oil- and water-based stains without leaving any residue behind. Scotchgard has more protection-focused products, while Bissell‚Äôs options lean towards use with dedicated cleaning machines. For standalone, no-fuss stain removal, though, the ForceField cleaner holds its own among its rivals.

**Value Proposal**  
The pricing feels justified for a professional-strength cleaner, especially given its ability to handle a wide range of stains. It easily replaces the need for multiple specialized cleaning products, and in that sense, it‚Äôs a smart spending choice for regular household use. The fact that it works well on everything from fabric upholstery to rugs adds even more bang for the buck, making it undeniable value without feeling like you‚Äôre cutting corners.

For almost a year I‚Äôve been freelancing in the UAE, saving so I can study for a master‚Äôs in Hamburg, Germany (or as of now Vienna, Austria). I built this life from nothing. I remember building this whole freelancing from nothing, to something I'm truly proud of and enough to get me to my dream.

We were together online for four years. At the start she was suicidal and self-harming. For a year and a half I did what no one else did: I stayed. I carried her when she couldn‚Äôt stand, I gave her energy and stability, I showed up every day.

The thing is ‚Äî it was never equal. I always gave; she always withdrew. She admitted she took me for granted, said she was cold, but nothing changed.

Then she got better. Job, routine, a future. And at the exact moment my world fell apart ‚Äî when I needed someone the way she needed me before ‚Äî she chose to leave. She wrapped it as a ‚Äúpermanent break,‚Äù called things ‚Äúunhealthy,‚Äù and reduced four years to ‚Äújust a friend.‚Äù

That hurts hard because I had no safety net at home. My family failed me: financial instability, emotional neglect, promises that never held. I didn‚Äôt have people to fall back on. She was the closest thing I had to someone who could stand with me. She left anyway.

I‚Äôm hurt and I‚Äôm angry. But I‚Äôm not broken. I‚Äôm moving forward. I‚Äôve saved what I could, I‚Äôll be in Vienna chasing my master‚Äôs, and I did it myself. She got the broken years ‚Äî the world will get the whole man I become.

**The thing is that it was never meant to be Vienna, her city, it was meant to be Hamburg, but it's honestly the best admission letter i recieved 2 months after our breakup.**


My final text to her before we blocked each other:

Right, (her name). If a 'permanent break' is truly what you need to finally reconcile with yourself, then I won't stand in your way. It's clear now this was never a two-sided effort; one of us perpetually gave, while the other mastered the art of receiving, only reciprocating when explicitly called out. You might, eventually, appreciate that singular investment. For my part, I simply detest the sheer selfishness of it.

One of us was capable of true forgiveness and moving past, while the other seemed utterly compelled to trigger those same old, selfish patterns, pulling the other right into them.Honestly, it's remarkably easy for me to call for this now. I walked into your life, a mess back then, as the undeniably BETTER HALF, pulling a disturbed girl back from the brink of suicide because she felt worthless, continuously throwing up cuz she saw no life in her or anything. And I'm walking out now, amidst my own significant uncertainties and a major transitional phase, still the BETTER HALF.

So yes, (her name), know that I forgive you for who you are, allowing you to move on without guilt ‚Äì though you were never good at handling that part, always throwing it at me with your anxious, avoidant silence. More importantly, I forgive myself for sticking by you, hoping to see the girl I once loved evolve into the woman I believed she could be, a hope that now, sadly, I fear will never be realized.

When I'm next in Vienna, one of many capitals I'll be visiting. I might just invite you for that coffee. Perhaps by then, you'll have become more.. more than a needy hollow vessel who only needs needs needs without reciprocating!And rest assured, the chapter of hoping for anything more from you is now definitively closed.

Remember me as the guy who was there for you when no one else was, not the guy you took for granted.

Cheers!

One Saturday, while browsing health blogs over breakfast, I read about this metabolism-boosting powder inspired by the lean, vital people of Japan‚Äôs Nagano region. Curious and hopeful, I decided to try Nagano Tonic‚Äîa citrusy drink mix packed with natural ingredients like green tea extract, ashwagandha, and mangosteen.

1n5wb95,https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1n5wb95/1_year_floxed/,1 year floxed,"Hello everybody, I'm floxed for one year, long time observer, first time posting.

M31, overall healthy and athletic until 1 year ago.

A rather long post, just want to give a good overview of my status so far and looking forward to advice/feedback.

I'm already really thankful for all the input and helpful discussions in this group and the sense of community which really helps in this crazy situation.

**FQ exposure:**

Took Cipro 1,5 years ago (5 days, 1000 mg/day) on vacation --> No (noticeable) side effects but also didn't know about FQs back then, no warning from the doctor. Just realised recently when going through my medical files.

1 year ago was prescribed Levo for 20 days, 500 mg/day for alleged prostatitis. Went to 4 different doctors before finally taking it to get different evaluations of the risks vs. benefits. EVERY single one told me it's safe since I'm under 60 and healthy and that sepsis would be way worse.

Right before Levo I was put on azithromycin, doxycyclin, amoxicillin, clavulanic acid one after another for around 3 weeks in total for the infection and had a gadolinium MRI for a different issue.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
**Symptoms (1st month):**

On day 2 or 3 of Levo I felt some slight tingling in my heels but dismissed it.

Next day stabbing pain in the back of the knees after a 30 min walk. Went to the doc that prescribed it, told me to keep taking it since there's no alternative and otherwise it would turn into sepsis and - quote - I would die.

Took the full 20 day course, no increase in symptoms during that time but also stayed home the entire time to not stress my body in any way.

Later turned out that there were in fact IV alternatives and that the test was most likely not even correct.

Since the pain in the legs and heels persisted my GP put me on Ibuprofen for a week.

Probably like a week after stopping it I woke up with severe eye pain and dry eyes and my teeth suddenly felt like the enamel was gone.

**Symptoms (month 2 until now):**

**Neuropathy**:

* Burning pain in the heels of my feet. Didn't have an appointment with a neurologist yet but Dr. Pieper suggests polyneuropathy and SFN.
* Getting the hiccups every time I cough now. Doesn't bother me but I guess it could be an indicator for autonomous nerve problems.

**Muscles/tendons/joints:**

* Stabbing pains in the back of the knees are kinda gone.
* In month 5 hip joints started hurting and clicking for several weeks. Now it's coming and going from time to time.
* First 6 months I didn't really walk a lot. Then visited a family member for a weeked and walked a bit more in the city. Since then the knees in general hurt more.
* Went on vacation for a few days last week for the first time since flox and walked a bit every day for 5 days, seems to be tolerated better than in December.
* Overall constant knee pain, I have to extend them from time to get some relieve.
* In month 7 I tripped and had to do a catch myself on my right foot. Horizontal meniscus tear, MRI confirmed, doctors say its quite big and needs surgery (will probably do a separate post for that).
* After around 6 months achilles pain started as well. Had to walk a few 100 m last week with a heavy backpack that put a lot of stress on my calves. Next few days achilles hurt quite badly. No sweeling or turning red. Achilles pain is not right in the part that would touch the back part of the shoe (don't know how to explain it properly) but feels more like it is where the tendon is probably attached to the bone.
* Upper body feels normal if there's no load. But when I moved some boxes in October when I moved apartments my shoulder joints hurt for several weeks afterwards in a stabbing way. Tried out swimming for like 5 mins in February, that tiny bit of stress/load already caused pain for a few days again.
* In the first  few months I carefully tried out some pushups on the edge of a table. Tendons felt more brittle first and better after a few weeks. But I still don't feel like trying to workout again.
* After 1 or 2 sets of biceps curls with 1 kg the entire upper arm hurts for a few days especially at the shoulder. Not like beeing sore but more like beeing hit with a hammer.

**Gut**

* Could eat everything before flox, only got an upset stomach through coffee.
* Fast food messes up my digestion now, but has gotten better a lot I'd say.
* Some foods make my teeth feel a lot more rough, was thinking of oxalates, not sure though, haven't looked into it deeply yet.
* Cut out sugar for the first 10 monts of being floxed, not one cookie or peace of chocolate.
* First time eating apple pie again after that sent me right to the toilet. But I'm guessing that was just the shock to the system since after that sinning from time to time didn't mess with my gut really.
* Stool test in month 2 showed leaky gut.

**Pre diabetes**

* Dr. Pieper diagnosed me with pre diabetes, levels where at like 115 mg/dl.
* Did 1 day of fasting/week (and cut out sugar) for 7 months--> now usually at like 95 mg/dl.
* (Pre flox it was at 85)

**Tinnitus**

* Started in month 5 and hasn't left since.
* Only noticable at night, sometimes spikes for a few seconds, sometimes a day.
* Didn't do any therapy for that so far, another floxie just suggested Q10 which I'm taking anyways.

**Alcohol**

* Not a big drinker in general since I'm always aware of the detrimental effects on the body but I do enjoy it especially when going out. Was planning on maybe even not drinking at all anymore as soon as the clubbing days are finally over.
* Tried my first sip of beer again 10 months post flox. Half a glass gives me several days of bad head ache.
* I see the alcohol tolerance as more of an indicator of the condition of the detox systems rather than something I'm aspiring to be able to do again. From this ""testing"" it seems like they're pretty f-ed.

**HRV**

* Post flox I started using Whoop to track my health data.
* HRV on average at around 60 ms.
* Interesting observation: After getting a big private project done last month my HRV reached 88 ms for the first time and stayed there for a few days. During that time my teeth startet to feel more smooth again.

**Mind**

* Didn't notice anything first but realised after a few months that I loose my train of thought really easily (especially if there's any interruption), not as eloquent anymore and can't seem to remember things as easily.
* Comprehensison skills got worse a bit.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Doctors/treatments:**

* **Ophthalmologist**:
   * ""You have extremely dry eyes for your age (since flox). Use hyaluronic eye drops."" --> Doing that, it helps but just treats the symptoms. Also eye sight got worse.
   * Been having (non bacterial!) chalazions a few times since floxed now, never before --> Ophthalmologist tried to prescribe Ofloxacin...
* **Dentist**:
   * X-ray was fine.
   * 2 molars (one hurts for 6 months now) show less vitality --> Doc tested each tooth through cold exposure, these two only reacted after like 10 seconds or not at all --> she wants to keep an eye on them and might eventually want to do a root canal.
   * She said she could see that the teeth seem to be missing fluoride and I should use a lot of it to replenish it. I said I wouldn't but would use hydrxylapatit instead.
   * She actually had experience with floxed patients and said that tooth replacment or implants are difficult in floxed people. They only operate on them carefully and after looking at the blood work.
   * Tooth pain getting more and more unfortunately now.

**Orhthopedic**:

* He knows a few floxies but told me that judging from the knee MRI for the meniscus tear it is unrealted to flox. Which is ofc not true but at least he knows a bit about flox.
* Told me that he would try to sew the menisus first and if that doesn't work remove it partly. I'm still undecided on what to do, probably getting a few more opinions.
* Another (10 year) floxie suggested I buy an ultrsound gadget and use that to increase bloodflow and not get any surgery.

**My Supps:**

* Magnesium, usually complex, 600 mg
* Vitamin D 10.000 IUs
* Vitamin C 800-1200 mg
* B12 injection 1200 mg once per week
* B complex 
* Benfotiamin 300 mg 
* Multivitamin 4 x times a day
* PQQ 20 mg
* PEA 600 mg
* Astaxanthin 8 mg
* Q10 200 mg
* Spirullina 800 mg
* Taurin 1000 mg
* Probiotics 
* Spermidin 2,4 mg
* Uridinmonophosphat 300 mg
* Cholin 250 mg
* Omega3 1300 mg
* Calcium Glucarat 500 mg

\--> Tbh I don't really notice any differences through the supps/haven't identified one that I desperately need.

I try to eat low carb (not tracking it so probably still too many carbs). No sugar, no alcohol.   


**Possible preexisting conditions:**

* Rather easily hurt myself in the gym or during sports. Guess I could have a very light version of EDS or just rather ""bad"" connective tissue. Normal flexibility though.
* Did a hair gene analysis before flox since I started to loose hair slightly, interesting results might be:
   * COL1A1: ""Predisposition to collagen instability.""
   * MTHFR: ""Increased predisposition to folate deficiency.""
   * GC: ""Predisposition to lower vitamin D serum levels.""
   * NGO1: ""Predisposition to lower NQO1 enzyme activity.""
   * MUC1: ""Predisposition to intermediate magnesium serum level.""
   * SLC30A3 and DMGDH: ""Predisposition to lower serum zinc / selenium levels.""
* However also no predisposition to low B12 for example but still got neuropathy.

**What got better?**

* Not a lot unfortunately:
* Eye pain slowly reduced to 0-10%. Couldn't look at my phone f√ºr more than 10 minutes or work more than an 2 hours at the computer in the beginning. Basically gone now but flared for 2 weeks when the Ophthalmologist used fluorescein.
* Plantar fasciitis for a few weeks in the beginning then never came back.
* Tolerate fast food again basically but don't do it often.
* I guess walking more for a few days in a row is not as bad anymore but just a tiny difference.

**What is NOT affected:**

* To also look on the bright side ;)
* Sleep. Using 2-3 mg of melatonin as Dr. Pieper prescribed but also sleep well without it.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Questions:**

* I'm assuming the dry eyes come from nerve damage regarding the production of tears. Or is it collagen damage in the eyes? Any successfull treatment experiences or helpful testing?
* What is the reason for the stabbing shoulder joint pain after even slightly loading it? What can I do about it?
* Can't do alcohol at all rn. I'm guessing it will stay that way, any experiences?
* What could be the reason for the rough teeth and tooth pain/""dying"" teeth? And what's the connection between being in a mentally better place and the teeth symptoms getting temporarily better? Disrupted collagen production that gets better if the mood is good so kind of a neurological issue?
* Any tinnitus advice? (Scanning the former posts here it seems nothing really helps except time but maybe someone had some success with new approaches?)

If you guys have any advice or have/had specific identical symptoms I'm happy for any feedback.

I have an appointment with Dr. Pieper on Wednesday, if you guys have any input on what I should ask him let me know :)

Overall, life is quite miserable, lost everything I loved (working out, sports, traveling, going out, living the big city life, being proud of a healthy body and of carefully taking care of it etc).

Best wishes to everyone!

I don't think we'll ever be coming back to Portugal, due to the behaviour of the people we have come across.

We are from the UK, where it is a more reserved country when it comes to walking down the streets and respecting females / others we have a certain standard.

After 4 days here, with tonight being a stay in Chaves, we feel too uncomfortable to be here. My girlfriend has had a significant number of men, older, younger, builders, shop attendants, gawping at her, staring at her from cars, attendants literally going behind her to look at her butt. Even just walking down the street shes been stared at and when she's made eye contact people haven't even smiled or said anything they just kept staring back.

I've had to be her guard in whenever she was taking a photo or in a shop making sure to be behind her to stop people looking from the back.

It's not just been the rude men that have been an issue, a number of other folk, older men and women have no manners, moving out the way in the streets, letting them past, not even a smile or a thank you has been thrown our way.

Even I felt very uncomfortable in the towns with people staring at us, even when staring back, nobody greeting us, it's all felt very rude and unwelcoming, having come from Spain when people have been very friendly and people haven't been staring at us.

I really wanted to come here and love the country and it's people, we have tried to take part in the local culture, visiting bakeries and coffee shops, but bar two people we have interacted with everyone else has made us feel very watched, judged, unwelcome, and men have been downright predators. 

Is this really what Portugal is like? If we were to ever come back for a city break will we experience the same? Is this because we've been in smaller towns, or is this a very uncomfortable culture? I would love to get an insight into our experience.",0,1756750600.0,portugal,42,0.31,False
