Chester looks really pretty - I've already visited York but wished I could've stayed for longer so I think I'd still enjoy Chester. Liverpool looks really lively and energetic and I'd hopefully be able to catch a show or something interesting going on. Sheffield seems to have a ton of pretty green space and parks but tomorrow looks rainy and there's only 1 indoor garden.

I live and breathe trading—the charts, the strategy, the thrill of the markets. But lately, I’ve realized something: as much as I love analyzing trends, what I really want is someone to share the journey with.  
About Me:
- Passionate about trading (Forex, stocks, crypto—you name it, I’ve probably traded it).  
-  Deeply analytical but also a hopeless romantic (I believe in data-driven decisions, but love? That’s all intuition).  
-  A mix of ambition and warmth**—I’ll geek out over market trends, but I also love lazy Sundays and deep conversations.  
-  Loyal and supportive —if you’ve got dreams, I’ll be your biggest cheerleader (and maybe even your part-time strategist).  

What I’m Looking For:
✔  A partner who understands passion**—whether it’s for art, science, or something entirely different. I love people who light up when they talk about what they care about.  
✔  Emotional depth**—someone who values real connection over surface-level small talk.  
✔  A sense of humor**—because let’s be honest, trading (and dating) requires the ability to laugh at yourself.  
✔  Patience and kindness**—life’s too short for games. I want something real.  

  Why This Could Be Great:**  
- Imagine combining our passions—maybe you teach me something new, and I’ll show you how to read a candlestick chart (or just make you coffee while you laugh at my attempts).  
- I’m not just looking for a relationship—I’m looking for a partner. Someone to grow with, challenge me, and make the quiet moments just as meaningful as the exciting ones. 
 
If This Resonates:
 Send me a message! Tell me:  
1. What’s something you’re truly passionate about?  
2. Your idea of a perfect lazy Sunday.  
3. (Optional) Your hottest take on Bitcoin—I won’t judge.  ",1,1748081354.0,u_Alive-Razzmatazz-4,0,1.0,False

I have never had any issues you guys mentioned

Drinking coffee cola etc? Never, I even drank beer and no one said anything

I can watch anything, I can play anything and honestly, the stuff they teach do make sense

I have never read from Ellen White so lets skip that,

Their culture of not eating Pork, Going on Sabbath to church, and anti LGBTQ honestly makes very good sense to me

(The LGBTQ topic is very sensible, in my country its not accepted, no matter what church you are, you are going to get bad looks)

I genuinly dont understand, like did your parents not let you do stuff? Were you manipulated to go to church? I have an ex adventist friend, he is now orthodox (not Christian) but he still follows the Adventist tradition, he just doesnt agree that Ellen G White is a prophet, and I honestly dont care, 
altough he never read something from her(neither have I)

1ku86az,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1ku86az/nightmare_rant/,Nightmare rant,"I just had a nightmare about my parents. 

I'm 33 years old. I've worked HARD to get where I am mentally. I haven't seen my mother since 2019 and my dad so rarely, if I'm unlucky one a year. It would be absurd if I see him because I finally told key people that he sexually assaulted me. 

I've had therapy for years. So much so that I feel good now in regards to managing my symptoms well. I know how to calm myself down, I know how to set boundaries, my reactions to things are minimized, I'm even growing to connect with other estranged family cautiously. I even called my mother in law ""mama"" (who knows a bit of what happened with my parents and said she'd be my mom if i wanted) , something I wouldn't have dared for fear of hurting my mother. 

So why the fuck did I have this nightmare? In the nightmare I'm getting driven to dance class (haven't done that since 11th grade highschool). Mom is silent like always and dad speaks little. I'm trapped in the car and they trap me at a restaurant to talk to me.  Mom has tears in her eyes and dad basically clocks out and says talk. 

I could have yelled, vented how their treatment of a child was absurd. They shot down all attempts at communication with being told don't talk back but got angry when I stopped talking all together.  They were frustrated that I held back myself from to just fake happy/ content with them but yelled when I cried or tried to tell them how I felt.  I tried to explain how I was terrified to talk to them and they said bullshit. So I gave up at some point. And like, that's not even getting into the parenting aspects that were just simply abuse. 

Instead, In the nightmare, I thought, I'm not dealing with this and woke myself up.  Something I taught myself at a stupidly young age due to constant nightmares. Now I take meds for insomnia, go figure.  That was at exactly 5am at when I woke up.

 I was suicidal living there from around 6th (?) grade till i moved out at 21 years old.  If it wasn't for my mantra (job, car, college, move out), supporting boyfriend (now husband)/ his loving family, and a weirdly religious mindset (I thought if I prayed hard enough, God would kill me. Otherwise there had to be more to life even if I didn't see it), I would have killed myself.

Now my life is heaven compared.  I got therapy at college a few years after I moved out. I have a degree in psychology, human behavior and I know down to the neuron how healing works.  I worked stupidly hard to heal: grounding techniques, talk therapy,  emdr, Journaling, reiki, witchcraft.

I still have this nightmare. 

I have a feeling it's a combo between grinding out in work to get it perfect for my boss (he's fine, just old mindsets from previous boss that linger), calling my mother in law ""mama"", and watching an old anime that I would have secretly in my parents house at like 2am in my room.

Still mad about it.  

Venting has helped.  This is kinda like Journaling.  My cat is laying on my leg so I can't move (and my husband gets sad if I leave the bed early)  but when I can I'm gonna have a fire in the fire pit & listen to birds while I drink my coffee/have breakfast. Maybe take a walk or something. ",1,1748081222.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

1ku855i,https://i.redd.it/c7tnuozkep2f1.jpeg,$ATYR Development Timeline Super Drop,"Hey everyone,

So I thought I’d pull together something for the community this weekend that I think you’ll all love—it’s what I’m calling the **$ATYR Development Timeline Super Drop**.

Those of you who’ve been following my posts will know that I take a pretty obsessive, hyper-forensic approach to research. I vacuum up everything I can find—transcripts, filings, scientific literature, media interviews, social posts, market data, short interest, options flow—and then I go looking for connections, correlations, and storylines that aren’t immediately obvious. It’s not just about the fundamentals; it’s also about understanding the mechanics and sentiment that shape how a story unfolds in the real world.

And $ATYR has been the perfect case study for that. The more I dig, the more interesting it gets. What started as a high-conviction investment idea has turned into a bit of a test bed for a new way of thinking about biotech setups. I’d been building out a repository of information and analysis—initially just for me, but now I’m making it available for all of you. And the response from the Reddit community over the past week has been nothing short of incredible. Honestly, the engagement drives me more than I expected. It’s addictive—in the best way.

So this weekend I wanted to do something that I thought you’d really enjoy. I really think you’re going to love this. Something to read as you have your cup of morning coffee. This post is for those of you who want the deepest possible read on the $ATYR narrative. What follows is a **chronological, categorised listing of every major development I’ve compiled—100+ total events—drawn directly from aTyr’s website and archive**, with a few extras from public sources. They’re current until just a few weeks ago.

I’ve also **categorised every item** (clinical, regulatory, scientific, IP, partnerships, etc.) and at the end, I’ve pulled together a synthesis of key read-between-the-lines insights—an attempt to map out the deeper narrative that I believe is unfolding underneath the surface.

This is a long post. It took me a lot of hours. I do go outside and see the sun sometimes, I promise—but this kind of research and content creation does takes a *lot* of effort. If you’ve found my work valuable and want to support more of it, it would be very much appreciated [Buy Me a Coffee here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/BioBingo).

## Narrative Synthesis: Key Insights Drawn From the Development Timeline.

This following section is very much a deep, read between the lines analysis of the development timeline and its events.

### 1. Platform Signaling Was Telegraphed Far Earlier Than Market Realised
From as early as 2018–2019, aTyr’s focus on Neuropilin-2 (NRP2) was visible in preclinical work—but the real unlock began with a 2021–2024 stream of mechanistic data culminating in the *Science Translational Medicine* 2025 publication.

In my view, this reflects deliberate reframing: efzofitimod isn’t just a drug—it’s the **anchor of a broader immunology platform**.

---

### 2. IP Strategy Mirrors Classic “Platform Buildout” Playbooks
Between 2022–2024, patents began clustering around new targets (e.g. myofibroblasts, antibody fragments, combination therapies). This mirrors companies like Alnylam in early-stage platform construction.

This strongly suggests they're either:
- Securing licensing leverage
- Protecting a broader indication strategy
- Or preparing the ground for M&A suitor attention

---

### 3. Commercial Readiness Is Underrated by Most Investors
The appointments of Dalia Rayes (commercial) and Jayant Aphale (GMP operations) are not “pre-revenue” hires—they’re **launch-phase specialists**. This team isn’t just dabbling—they’re positioning to **self-commercialize in the US**, with selective licensing in EU/JP.

In my opinion, this alone may justify a valuation uplift post-readout.

---

### 4. Regulatory Momentum Is Rare for a Microcap
This company has:
- Maintained the same FDA review team from EOP2 through Phase 3
- Received formal endpoint guidance that reduces statistical variability
- Earned Orphan/Fast Track designations in multiple jurisdictions

This is regulatory choreography. It tells me the company is **clearly aligned with regulators**, a rarity in early-stage biotech.

---

### 5. Market Mechanics May Trigger Reflexive Overshoots
We’re looking at:
- Float under 90M shares
- Retail ownership rising
- High short interest
- Institutional accumulation
- $100K–$120K price point baked in

This is a **coiled spring**. If the Phase 3 is clean, the reflexivity risk is real. I think we’ll see it move past any DCF logic if institutions, shorts, and retail collide.

---

### 6. Inflection Stacking Is No Accident
Look at the timeline: DSMB reviews → regulatory milestones → publications → exec hires → data drops.

That’s **tight choreography**—typical of companies with full-spectrum roadmaps (uplisting, acquisition, launch). It indicates to me that they’ve been planning this for years.

---

### 7. Regulatory Sequencing Suggests Label Expansion Readiness
Multiple designations (Fast Track + Orphan) across **multiple indications and geographies** signal a pre-emptive roadmap.

They’re not just navigating a readout—they’re mapping:
- Label expansion
- Ex-US approval
- Potential priority review

That’s not accidental. It’s forward-engineering.

---

### 8. Scientific Publication Cadence Shows Maturity
You don’t go from preclinical posters to a *Science Translational Medicine* cover by chance. The team used STMed, *Chest*, *Eur Resp J* to tell a story:
1. Mechanism
2. Clinical proof
3. Global legitimacy

It’s a scientific marketing plan.

---

### 9. Executive Appointments Telegraphed the Strategy
When you hire:
- Rayes (ex-ChemoCentryx)
- Benevich (ex-Neurocrine)

You’re not just filling positions for the sake of it. You’re shaping optics. These are names with launch pedigrees. The implication is clear: **aTyr is anticipating scrutiny**—and responding with high credibility hires.

---

### 10. IP and Pipeline Show a Quiet Platform Expansion
By mid-2023, they were rolling out:
- ATYR2810 (anti-NRP2 in oncology)
- ATYR0101 (fibrosis-reversing tRNA fragment)
- New combination patents

This is **a full-blown platform**, quietly being locked in. In my view, they’re building toward a multi-asset, multi-mechanism immunology company.

---

### 11. Global Partnerships Reflect Strategic Foresight
Collaborations with:
- Pangu BioPharma (Asia)
- Foundation for Sarcoidosis Research (US)
- Kyorin (Japan)

…show geopolitical alignment. They’re not waiting to “go global”—they’re **already localizing credibility**.

---

### Final Observation

If you’ve made it this far—thank you and well done! I genuinely appreciate you taking the time to dive deep with me. This post took a lot of effort to put together, but I hope it gave you something valuable: a richer sense of how this $ATYR story has been constructed, and why I think it’s one of the most fascinating setups in biotech right now.

In my view, this isn’t just a timeline—it’s a map. And when you zoom out, the picture it paints is clear: **a company quietly building with the precision and sequencing of a future platform leader.**

We all know $ATYR is still being priced like a small biotech. But everything from the cadence of news to the quality of hires to the regulatory alignment suggests otherwise. If the Phase 3 readout lands cleanly, I think the re-rating could be **nonlinear**—not just based on the data, but on:

- **Platform validation**
- **Regulatory momentum**
- **Strategic scarcity**
- **Reflexive market dynamics**

And once the institutions catch on to what retail’s already starting to factor in? It won’t just be an upward move—it could be a structural transition.

Thanks again for reading. I hope this helped add clarity to your own thinking. Let me know what you’d like me to post next.

Been there? Yeah, me too. The hosting decision can make or break your online presence, and frankly, it's one of those choices that'll either have you sleeping peacefully or waking up to panicked ""website down"" alerts.

Today, we're diving deep into what's arguably the most important hosting debate of 2025: **CloudWays vs DigitalOcean**. These aren't just random competitors – there's actually a fascinating plot twist here that makes this comparison even more intriguing. Spoiler alert: DigitalOcean actually acquired CloudWays back in 2022, but they've maintained their distinct approaches to cloud hosting.

After managing dozens of websites across both platforms (and losing plenty of sleep over server configurations), I'm here to break down everything you need to know. Whether you're a developer who dreams in command lines or a business owner who just wants things to work seamlessly, this comparison will help you make the right choice.

# Understanding the Players: CloudWays vs DigitalOcean Fundamentals 🎯

# What is CloudWays? The Managed Hosting Hero

CloudWays is like having a technical co-founder who handles all the server stuff while you focus on growing your business. It's a **managed cloud hosting platform** that essentially acts as a bridge between you and powerful cloud infrastructure providers like DigitalOcean, AWS, Google Cloud, Vultr, and Linode.

Think of CloudWays as your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man of hosting – with great power comes zero responsibility (for server management, that is). They handle all the technical complexities: server configuration, security updates, backups, monitoring, and performance optimization. You get enterprise-level cloud hosting without needing a computer science degree.

What makes CloudWays special is their **platform-agnostic approach**. You're not locked into their hardware – instead, you can choose from five major cloud providers while enjoying CloudWays' managed services layer on top. It's like getting the best of both worlds: cutting-edge infrastructure with white-glove service.

# What is DigitalOcean? The Developer's Playground

DigitalOcean is the original cloud infrastructure darling that revolutionized how developers think about virtual private servers. Since 2011, they've been providing **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** with their famous ""Droplets"" – virtual machines that you can spin up in seconds.

DigitalOcean built their reputation on three pillars: **simplicity, affordability, and developer-focused design**. While AWS was busy adding their 47th database service (okay, slight exaggeration), DigitalOcean kept things clean and straightforward. Their control panel doesn't require a PhD to navigate, and their documentation is genuinely helpful.

However, here's the catch: with DigitalOcean, you're the captain of your own ship. You get raw computing power, but you're responsible for configuring everything – from security patches to load balancing to backup strategies. It's incredibly powerful if you have the technical chops, but it can be overwhelming for non-technical users.

# The Plot Twist: When DigitalOcean Acquired CloudWays 🔄

Here's where things get interesting. In May 2022, DigitalOcean acquired CloudWays for $350 million, creating one of the most unique dynamics in the hosting industry. Imagine if Ferrari bought a luxury chauffeur service – suddenly, you could either drive the sports car yourself or have someone else handle the driving while you enjoy the ride.

This acquisition wasn't about eliminating competition; it was about **expanding DigitalOcean's market reach**. DigitalOcean recognized that not everyone wants to manage servers, even if those servers are beautifully designed Droplets. CloudWays allowed them to serve the growing market of businesses that wanted cloud performance without the technical overhead.

The fascinating part? Both platforms have maintained their distinct identities and pricing structures. DigitalOcean continues to serve developers and technical teams who want control, while CloudWays focuses on businesses, agencies, and WordPress users who prioritize convenience over customization.

What this means for you in 2025: You're essentially choosing between two different philosophies under the same corporate umbrella. It's not about which company to trust – it's about which approach fits your technical comfort level and business needs.

# Ease of Use: Where CloudWays Shines Brightest ✨

# CloudWays Dashboard Experience: Hosting Made Human

I'll be honest – the first time I logged into CloudWays after years of wrestling with cPanel and server command lines, I almost cried with relief. The dashboard feels like it was designed by people who actually use hosting services, not engineers who think everyone enjoys spending weekends troubleshooting PHP configurations.

The **one-click application deployment** is genuinely one-click. Want WordPress? Click. Need a staging environment? Click. Want to scale your server resources? Drag a slider. It's so intuitive that I've successfully walked complete beginners through server setups over phone calls.

CloudWays' approach to **server management** removes the intimidation factor completely. Instead of SSH commands and configuration files, you get visual interfaces for everything:

* **Application management** with clear performance metrics
* **Backup scheduling** that actually makes sense
* **Security settings** explained in plain English
* **Team collaboration** tools that don't require IT training

The platform also includes built-in **staging environments**, which is huge for anyone who's ever accidentally broken a live website while testing changes. You can clone your entire site, make modifications, and push changes with confidence.

# DigitalOcean's Learning Curve: Power Comes with Responsibility

DigitalOcean's control panel is clean and well-designed, but it assumes you know what you're doing. Creating a Droplet is straightforward, but once it's running, you're essentially staring at a blank Linux server wondering what to do next.

The **technical requirements** are real:

* Command line proficiency for most configurations
* Understanding of web server software (Apache, Nginx)
* Knowledge of database management
* Security hardening expertise
* Backup strategy implementation

Don't get me wrong – DigitalOcean provides excellent documentation and tutorials. Their community guides are genuinely helpful, and their API is developer-friendly. But there's an undeniable **time investment** required to get productive.

I've seen talented developers spend entire weekends configuring what CloudWays sets up automatically in minutes. If you're building a SaaS product or running an agency, that time cost adds up quickly.

# Performance Showdown: Speed Matters ⚡

When it comes to raw performance, both platforms can deliver exceptional results, but they achieve it through different approaches.

CloudWays achieved an excellent score in performance tests, scoring slightly above DigitalOcean in head-to-head comparisons. This makes sense when you consider CloudWays' **managed optimization layer**.

# CloudWays Performance Advantages

CloudWays doesn't just give you a server – they give you a **performance-optimized server**. Every server comes pre-configured with:

* **Built-in caching** (Redis, Memcached, Varnish)
* **SSD storage** across all plans
* **PHP 8.2 support** with easy version switching
* **Cloudflare CDN integration** (optional but seamless)
* **Advanced cache management** tools

The real magic happens with their **ThunderStack** – a custom-built server stack optimized for PHP applications. In my testing, WordPress sites hosted on CloudWays consistently showed 40-60% faster loading times compared to default DigitalOcean configurations.

# DigitalOcean Performance Potential

DigitalOcean provides the raw ingredients for exceptional performance, but you need to cook the meal yourself. Their **Premium Intel Droplets** offer impressive specifications:

* High-frequency Intel processors
* NVMe SSD storage
* Dedicated CPU options for consistent performance
* Multiple data center locations globally

DigitalOcean guarantees an excellent 99.99% uptime, which is industry-leading. However, achieving optimal performance requires significant optimization work on your part.

The key difference: CloudWays delivers optimized performance out of the box, while DigitalOcean gives you the tools to potentially achieve even better performance if you have the expertise to configure everything properly.

# Pricing Breakdown: Getting Your Money's Worth 💰

Here's where things get really interesting. The pricing structures reflect each platform's philosophy perfectly.

# CloudWays Pricing Structure: Transparent and Predictable

CloudWays pricing starts from $14/month with pay-as-you-go billing, meaning you only pay for the hours your server actually runs.

|Provider|Basic Plan|RAM|Storage|Bandwidth|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|DigitalOcean Standard|1GB|25GB SSD|1TB|$11/month||
|DigitalOcean Premium|1GB|25GB NVMe|1TB|$13/month||
|Vultr Standard|1GB|32GB SSD|1TB|$14/month||
|Vultr High Frequency|1GB|32GB NVMe|1TB|$16/month||
|Linode|1GB|25GB SSD|1TB|$12/month||

What's included in **every CloudWays plan**:

* ✅ Free SSL certificates
* ✅ Automated daily backups
* ✅ 24/7 expert support
* ✅ Staging environments
* ✅ Built-in caching
* ✅ Security monitoring
* ✅ Team collaboration tools
* ✅ One-click cloning

# DigitalOcean Pricing Analysis: Raw Value with Hidden Costs

DigitalOcean's pricing appears more affordable initially:

|Droplet Type|RAM|vCPUs|Storage|Transfer|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Basic|1GB|1|25GB SSD|1TB|$6/month|
|Premium Intel|1GB|1|25GB NVMe|1TB|$7/month|
|CPU-Optimized|4GB|2|80GB SSD|4TB|$24/month|

But here's what's **NOT included**:

* ❌ Automated backups ($1.20/month extra)
* ❌ Load balancing ($10/month+)
* ❌ Managed databases ($15/month+)
* ❌ CDN services (additional costs)
* ❌ SSL certificate management
* ❌ Security monitoring tools

**Real-world cost example**: A basic WordPress site that would cost $11/month on CloudWays (fully managed) might cost $6/month on DigitalOcean for the Droplet, plus $1.20 for backups, plus your time for configuration and maintenance. If you value your time at even $25/hour, CloudWays quickly becomes the better deal.

# Security Features: Protecting Your Digital Assets 🔒

Security is where the managed vs. unmanaged difference becomes crystal clear.

# CloudWays Security: Fort Knox for Websites

CloudWays treats security as a **managed service**, not an afterthought:

* **Dedicated firewalls** for every server
* **Automated security patches** and updates
* **Free SSL certificates** with auto-renewal
* **Two-factor authentication** built-in
* **Regular security audits** by their team
* **DDoS protection** included
* **24/7 security monitoring**

The peace of mind factor is huge. I sleep better knowing that security updates are handled automatically and that there's a team monitoring for threats 24/7.

# DigitalOcean Security: DIY Protection

DigitalOcean provides **security tools**, but you need to implement them:

* Cloud firewalls (configuration required)
* Droplet snapshots for backups
* SSH key management
* VPC networking options
* Monitoring and alerting tools

DigitalOcean offers default end-to-end encryption and droplet monitoring, but DDoS protection requires purchasing their CDN add-on.

The challenge: You're responsible for staying on top of security updates, configuring firewalls properly, and monitoring for threats. For technical teams, this level of control is valuable. For busy business owners, it's a significant burden.

# Customer Support: When Things Go Wrong 🆘

# CloudWays Support: Your 24/7 Technical Co-Founder

CloudWays offers 24/7 support with substantial knowledge bases and live chat included in all plans. But what really sets them apart is the **quality and expertise** of their support team.

I've dealt with CloudWays support dozens of times, and they consistently demonstrate:

* **Deep technical knowledge** beyond basic troubleshooting
* **Proactive problem-solving** rather than just answering questions
* **Fast response times** (usually under 30 minutes)
* **Follow-up communication** to ensure issues are resolved

Real example: When I was struggling with a performance issue on a high-traffic WordPress site, their support team didn't just tell me to ""clear the cache."" They analyzed my server logs, identified a plugin conflict, recommended specific optimizations, and followed up two days later to confirm everything was working smoothly.

# DigitalOcean Support: Good Documentation, Limited Hand-Holding

DigitalOcean provides 24/7 support and excellent documentation, but live chat is only available with their Premier Support plan.

Their **community tutorials** are genuinely excellent – some of the best technical documentation in the industry. For common issues, you'll often find detailed guides written by their team.

However, **standard support** is limited to tickets and email. Response times can vary, and the support team focuses more on infrastructure issues rather than application-level problems.

# Target Audiences: Who Should Choose What 🎯

# CloudWays is Perfect For...

**Small to Medium Businesses** who want enterprise-level hosting without enterprise-level complexity. If you're running an e-commerce store, digital agency, or content-heavy website, CloudWays removes the technical barriers while delivering excellent performance.

**WordPress Users** get particular value from CloudWays' WordPress-optimized features. The platform includes WordPress-specific caching, staging environments, and security configurations that would take hours to set up manually on DigitalOcean.

**Agencies and Freelancers** benefit from CloudWays' team collaboration features and client management tools. You can give clients access to specific servers without worrying about them accidentally breaking something important.

**Growing Businesses** appreciate the **scalability without complexity**. As your traffic grows, you can increase server resources with a few clicks rather than migrating to larger Droplets and reconfiguring everything.

# DigitalOcean Works Best For...

**Developers and Technical Teams** who want full control over their infrastructure. If you're building custom applications, need specific software configurations, or want to implement advanced deployment pipelines, DigitalOcean provides the flexibility you need.

**Cost-Conscious Projects** where you have the technical expertise to handle server management. If you're comfortable with command lines and server administration, DigitalOcean's lower base costs can be attractive.

**Learning and Experimentation** scenarios where you want to understand how web infrastructure works. DigitalOcean's approach forces you to learn valuable skills, even if it requires more time investment.

**Large-Scale Applications** that need custom architectures, multiple databases, or complex networking setups benefit from DigitalOcean's infrastructure flexibility.

# Real User Experiences: What People Actually Say 📝

# The CloudWays Love

Across forums and review sites, CloudWays users consistently highlight:

Reviewers felt that CloudWays meets the needs of their business better than DigitalOcean and preferred doing business with CloudWays overall.

**User testimonial from Reddit**: *""Moved from SiteGround to CloudWays and the performance difference is night and day. My WordPress site loads 3x faster, and I haven't had to think about server management once.""*

**Agency owner feedback**: *""CloudWays saved me probably 10-15 hours per month that I was spending on server maintenance. That time is now spent on client work instead of fighting with PHP configurations.""*

# The DigitalOcean Appreciation

Reviewers found DigitalOcean easier to use for initial setup, with amazing user experience and clear, friendly interfaces.

**Developer perspective**: *""DigitalOcean's API and deployment tools are fantastic. We've built our entire CI/CD pipeline around their services, and the flexibility is unmatched.""*

**Startup feedback**: *""Started with DigitalOcean because of the pricing, and stayed because we learned so much about infrastructure management. Now our team can handle any hosting challenge.""*

# Common Complaints

**CloudWays concerns**:

* Some users find the pricing too high compared to competitors
* Limited customization options for advanced users
* Markup on cloud provider pricing (typically 2-3x the base cost)

**DigitalOcean challenges**:

* Steep learning curve for non-technical users
* Time investment required for proper setup and maintenance
* Additional costs for managed services add up quickly

# The Verdict: Why CloudWays Takes the Crown 👑

After extensive testing, user research, and real-world experience managing websites on both platforms, **CloudWays emerges as the winner for most use cases in 2025**.

Here's why CloudWays is the smarter choice:

# 🚀 Performance Out of the Box

CloudWays delivers optimized performance immediately, while DigitalOcean requires significant configuration time to achieve similar results.

# 💰 True Total Cost of Ownership

While CloudWays appears more expensive upfront, the included features and time savings make it more cost-effective for most businesses.

# 🛡️ Security and Peace of Mind

Managed security updates, monitoring, and backups remove major operational burdens that can be costly if handled incorrectly.

# 📈 Scalability Made Simple

Growing your hosting resources shouldn't require advanced technical skills or migration headaches.

# 🎯 Focus on Your Business

CloudWays lets you focus on growing your business rather than becoming a server administrator.

**The Bottom Line**: Unless you're a developer who genuinely enjoys server management or you have specific technical requirements that demand custom configurations, CloudWays provides superior value in 2025.

# Getting Started with CloudWays

Ready to make the switch? Here's my recommended approach:

1. **Start with the 3-day free trial** (no credit card required)
2. **Choose DigitalOcean as your cloud provider** for the best balance of performance and cost
3. **Begin with a 1GB plan** – you can always scale up later
4. **Use the migration service** if you're moving from another host

**Pro tip**: Use promo code **DEVOPS30** at signup for 30% off your first three months.

CloudWays isn't just hosting – it's a **competitive advantage** that lets you focus on what matters most: growing your business, serving your customers, and building something amazing online.

The choice is yours, but if you want hosting that just works while delivering enterprise-level performance, CloudWays is the clear winner in 2025. Your future self (and your sleep schedule) will thank you. 🌟",1,1748080834.0,NoCodeCommunity,0,1.0,False

So I dropped him then and there and moved on . 
I live alone for university and parents are in a different state , had a depressive episode , didn't have anyone , so contacted him hoping he can be someone to hold me down or help me through it .

He showed up , shared sweet words , but then started pushing me physically beyond what I was comfortable with , got irritative and started convincing me to let him have access to me because ""We've already shared all of this, what's the issue now?""

This happens a lot, but what she did next was new and unexpected to me: in an attempt to get more pets (while already being petted), she forcefully hit my hand - holding a cup of freshly poured coffee - and in doing so managed to splash about half the cup onto my monitor (from the middle downwards). After ensuring she was fine, I turned off the monitor, cleaned the spill, and let it dry for the rest of the day.

The next day I turned on the monitor and it worked as usual, so I did not think too much of it. But the past week, it has started to randomly glitch and produce artifacts (see the attached video). I have not been able to tie it to anything specific: some days nothing happens, other days it will glitch out several times in a few minutes, be fine for an hour, repeat the cycle. What bothers me the most is that the monitor goes black when using the OSD whenever a glitch occurs, which suggests to me it is a hardware issue.

I have already tried the following:

\- Replace the DP 1.4 cable with a DP 2.1 cable I had lying around. I know the bandwidth should not matter, but the DP 2.1 cable had not been used yet.

\- Run stress tests on my PC with OCCT, which did not flag any hardware-related issues with my PC.

\- Run DDU and reinstall the latest Nvidia drivers.

\- Switched over to HDMI for a day, it also produced said artifacts. I have not seen them pop up when connecting my PC to my OLED TV.

So far I have been unable to reproduce these artifacts myself, which makes it difficult to isolate the root cause, but given the earlier coffee spill it makes me suspect that my monitor is dying.

Any thoughts?

We are both Nigerians and I’m 27 she’s a 50 but doesn’t look like it at all. I was shocked when she told me her age, let’s call her Mrs S. we’re both healthcare assistants.

Mrs S likes to talk about some staff to me like complaining about what the person did and she doesn’t like it and then when she sees that person she complained about, she’s all smiles and laughing with them. I’ve noticed this with everyone she talks about. More like she’s trying to influence me to also hate the person (which will never happen, my father taught me not to inherit enemies 💀) but then again she goes on and plays with that person. Makes me realise that she’s so fake and not her true self.


Now about me, I noticed she likes to copy me. When I newly joined the hospital and she kept asking me what am I using on my face (I always get compliments about how nice and smooth my skin is) when she asked me last year, I literally sent a picture about everything I’m using and explained the steps. No gatekeeping 🙂 now 2 days ago she asked me again and because I changed some products I just told her that I use La Roche posay moisturiser and sunscreen which I took screenshots and sent to her on WhatsApp and got no “thank you” by the way. I came into the kitchen and she randomly asked me if I got prescriptions for those products before using and I said nope, it’s just an ordinary moisturiser and sunscreen.



The other day I brought my matcha, milk frother and coffee cup which were all pink and another staff I get along with was there too and she said “who brought these” and I said me and she was like oh you’re also doing pink pink like Jennifer (a nurse that uses pink stuff too) and I was like what are you talking about? I’ve been using pink stuff since I was 5 lol 


She’s always telling me how nice my wig is ( it’s a curly fringe wig) then she asked me if I bought it from Nigeria as it looks very expensive I said nope I bought it on AliExpress for less than £30 😂 that it’s my work wig so I’m no spending too much money on a work wig. Then yesterday she was like oh let me take a picture of it and send to my hair vendor back in Nigeria so I can buy 🤣 I was like sure go ahead 💀



These are just a few I could list now and there are many more times she has copied me.

Heather has just completed a short avant-garde synthesizer performance. Jemima, impressed, approaches her.


---

[Scene: The warmly lit interior of Fahrenheit. Mid-evening. Heather, in her thirties, is packing up a compact modular synthesizer rig. Jemima, now in her early seventies but striking in presence—tall, finely dressed in vintage velvet—approaches with quiet confidence.]

Jemima:
That was Stockhausen, wasn’t it? But filtered through… dare I say… someone with a beating heart.

Heather: (slightly flustered, smiling)
Yes. Hymnen, mostly. But I reworked some transitions. I… I hope that’s not sacrilegious.

Jemima:
Not at all. Stockhausen would have adored you—he always encouraged disobedience. Especially if it made the music more alive. You played with real intuition. And your pacing—utterly exquisite.

Heather: (surprised)
Thank you. That means a lot. I don’t usually get feedback like that. People mostly just… say it’s weird.

Jemima:
Oh, they always will. Mediocrity clings to the familiar. But art—true art—knows no safety.
I’m Jemima, by the way. Dr. Jemima von Steckreich. Though I’m known in some circles as Queen Jemima.

Heather: (laughs, unsure if she’s joking)
Queen Jemima?

Jemima:
A long story. Let’s just say I once danced in a lavender ballgown in the presence of a Communist general—and lived.
And you are?

Heather:
Heather. Heather Wigston. I work in community services. But music’s… kind of what keeps me sane.

Jemima:
You’re more than sane, Heather—you’re tuned. Most people are walking around out of pitch with the world. But you—you’re modulating deliberately. Have you ever studied composition formally?

Heather:
No. I didn’t have the right background. Or the right money. So I taught myself. Read everything I could get my hands on. Built my own patches from YouTube videos and PDFs.

Jemima: (leaning in slightly)
I started in church halls. No one ever gave me permission either. I took it.
Have you ever considered teaching? Or research?

Heather:
God, no. I mean—no one would take me seriously. I haven’t even been to university.

Jemima: (with a glint of challenge)
What if I told you I know a place that would take you seriously? A college where I happen to Chair a department. And where raw talent, especially from unexpected places, is very welcome?

Heather: (shocked)
You’re serious?

Jemima:
Entirely. But only if you promise me one thing.

Heather:
What’s that?

Jemima:
Never, ever let anyone tell you your instincts are wrong. Especially not men in grey suits with graphs.
We’ll have tea. At my house. Tomorrow. I want to hear everything.

After that, I began applying on job sites like **LinkedIn,** and **Indeed**, and somehow discovered **speedy-apply.com**, which literally sped everything up immensely. I ended up sending 47 applications in total, consumed way too many crackers, and found peace knowing my resume was out in the universe.

Worth a read.","Link, this post comes from VAXEE Twitter account: https://x.com/vaxee_corp/status/1925854348308885862?t=ofm-L9wKdedGXsgLtstDCA&s=19

This post originates from the personal Facebook page of Vincent Tang, the Chairman of VAXEE. Originally, it was intended to share his thoughts on the development process of the PD, but it gradually expanded to cover more topics, including his personal views on recent events related to VAXEE. We believe this is worth sharing with those who care about VAXEE, and thus we are reposting it here.

【Starting with PD】
*Long post warning
If you decide to continue reading, please keep an open mind—it’ll be easier that way.

The PD series mousepad was actually the first product VAXEE intended to launch. We believed that rounded edge stitching offers more comfort compared to non-stitched or traditionally stitched edges. This wasn’t a new technique—it’s been around for a long time. However, we underestimated how difficult it would be to achieve high quality with this method. We faced issues with flatness, durability, and delamination (where the fabric separates from the base), which delayed the release by five years. During PD’s development, we also created the PB, PC, and PE series. While PC uses similar edge stitching, its production method is different and extremely demanding on fabric quality. That’s why we haven’t made other surface types for PC’s base yet—and PC’s fabric can’t be used on other production methods. As for why PE launched before PD, that’s because just when we thought PD was ready for mass production, new problems emerged and it was postponed again.

PD’s production process might seem “uncool” by today’s standards—it requires our production staff to monitor each piece and manually handle many steps to maintain quality and yield. But since we promised to deliver high-quality products, we chose to move forward anyway. We’ll see later whether the process can be optimized while still ensuring quality, to ease the burden on our production team.

Now that PD’s production has stabilized, we plan to release versions with different surface fabrics in the future to offer a wider variety of tactile experiences for our supporters. We’ve also developed different base stiffness levels that will be introduced over time.

Since we’ve outlined the development history of PD, we might as well address some common questions and misunderstandings about VAXEE to help those who are interested in the brand better understand our philosophy and avoid unrealistic expectations. If you're curious about topics beyond PD, keep reading.

➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖

【Is VAXEE a brand?】
Yes. VAXEE is a retail brand that aims to provide consumers with reliable products and service—not a traditional product brand like we used to create.

➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖

【Why the shift?】
When we made product brands in the past, one of the most frustrating issues was that customers with problems or defective products couldn’t get proper service. We would occasionally learn about a bad customer experience, but often couldn’t reach them to help. This was painful for a team focused on long-term sustainability. We didn’t want history to repeat itself.

➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖

【Why doesn’t VAXEE sell through e-commerce platforms or global distributors?】
For the same reasons mentioned above—“immediate” and “complete” service. Yes, it makes buying our products less convenient, and it slows down our sales growth. We also need to train more customer service staff.

There was once a problem that troubled me for a while. There were some areas where we couldn’t provide service, but there were people in those areas who wanted to buy our products and said they weren't worried about the high shipping costs or the lack of after-sales service, as long as we were willing to sell to them. But in the end, I decided not to make an exception. Because I know that once you make an exception, you stop moving forward on the path to your goals.

Whenever we face a difficult choice, if we bring out our highest guiding principles to make a decision, we can quickly come to a conclusion, even if we know it's not the perfect solution for the moment. But with our values of sustainable management, many problems will gradually be solved over time. However, this comes with a premise: if we don’t strive for progress and just think that time will fix everything, then what gets solved is VAXEE itself. So, we must maintain the spirit of “continual improvement”.

➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖

【Why launch the anime-themed mousepads?】
Some people were really bothered by this move, saying it wasn’t the “VAXEE” they envisioned. Some even said “VAXEE is dead.” If you’re reading this, I hope you’ll hear me out.

First, VAXEE is a retail brand that sells high-quality products and provides good service. If we were a pro esports product brand like ZOWIE, we might not have released these.

Second, while I’ve been in the esports industry for over 23 years (from SteelSeries to ZOWIE to VAXEE), I’m not a former pro player. I can never match someone like Xanver in understanding or designing esports gear. That’s why I made him our CEO. It shows VAXEE is still esports at its core.

In esports’ early days, many star players lived hard lives, despite bringing fans amazing games. Their income didn’t reflect their impact. That’s why we collaborated with players during the ZOWIE era—to help improve their lives. Sure, we gained something too, but the risks were higher for our small company. Fortunately, those efforts paid off.

Similarly, VAXEE holds a mousepad design competition, which not only allows consumers to choose the designs they like but also gives these creators a chance to gain more recognition from others for their work. The top performers even get some prize money, because they’ve provided products that make consumers happy. I believe they deserve it. When it comes to signing creators, it's because their work brings joy to more people, so we offer them extra encouragement.

So even if anime mousepads and pro collaborations seem unrelated, they’re driven by the same values. If we wanted to maximize profit, we’d ditch our sales restrictions and go full-on with big e-commerce. But we didn’t.

Xanver has worked with me since he was 20. He’s still the same esports pro, and while he leads our competitive gear, I use my energy to support others in different fields. That’s the real VAXEE. If my values disappoint you, I apologize.

➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖

【Why did the VAXEE team leave ZOWIE and go independent?】
Actually, it’s just a matter of differing corporate cultures, and both sides are not able to adapt. There’s no clear winner or victim in this process and outcome. During the few years of working together, both sides tried to adjust, but the results weren’t satisfactory. Life is short, and our main purpose is to provide products and services to consumers. I believe it's best to focus on that primary goal and minimize distractions that are unrelated to it, for the benefit of everyone. For consumers, having one more product option is probably not a bad thing.

Just recently, I even met the now-retired GM of BenQ for coffee and had a great chat.

➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖

【Why did VAXEE start a LifeStyle division?】
When we started VAXEE, we didn’t just want to solve the customer service gaps of the past. We also wanted to serve those who believe in us for the long run—even into their 50s, 60s, or 70s. Once Xanver firmly took the esports lead, we created the LifeStyle division to offer high-quality daily-use products to our supporters.

The first product was a T-shirt made with fabric developed by our mousepad material partner—an expert and passionate textile developer. The fabric was incredibly comfortable, though too expensive to sell well. We lost money, but I don’t regret it. If a great product is within acceptable financial loss, I want to offer it to those who appreciate it.

Just like we released a mouse bungee despite wired mice fading, we pursued what we believed in. Some friends even repurchased the T-shirt, which really encouraged us. Thank you.

➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖

【Why did VAXEE collaborate with Ninjutso on a mouse?】
As a retailer aiming to offer quality products, we want to collaborate with other brands. We’re grateful to Ninjutso’s Bill for trusting us. The collaboration turned out well—many fans of the Sora shape loved the result. I believe it benefited all three parties: customers, Ninjutso, and VAXEE.

We plan to do more partnerships like this to give our supporters more excellent choices.

➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖

【How do you become a VAXEE VIP?】
I don’t have a clear answer. If it were just about spending, we could set a number. But it’s not. Some people may not spend much but show their love and support through interactions, and we consider them VIPs too. That’s one benefit of personally handling all customer service.

There’s a customer in Shanghai who became friends with our team there, often bringing homemade cakes and treats. I don’t know how much she spent, but she’s definitely a VIP. I even invited her to our dinner when I visited.

Maybe we shouldn’t call it “VIP”—it can be misleading—but we haven’t thought of a better name yet.

➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖

【Why are VAXEE products more expensive?】
A few key reasons:

1. We release a new mouse every 3–4 months, in small batches of a few thousand. Just the tooling and certification costs are much higher than others.

2. For each batch, our production team personally inspects every unit at the factory—traveling 1–2 times a month. They’ve become VIPs at local hotels.

3. In order to provide more choices for consumers who don’t just look at price and specs, but also clearly understand what kind of product they actually need, our product development timeline and investment for each new category tend to be longer. If you recall, when wireless mice had already become mainstream in the market, we released our first wireless mouse—the XE Wireless—one to two years later than other brands. The reason is simple: if we were making a wireless mouse just for the sake of being wireless, offering something similar to what others already have, then the market wouldn’t need VAXEE, and I wouldn’t see any reason to design and produce our own mouse. The competitive mode of the XE Wireless has indeed provided some users with a better experience..

In short, we’re still a small company, but thanks to your support, we can keep going with our own philosophy. We’re truly grateful.

【If there’s a second round of full inspections, why are there still quality issues?】

From the PB issue a few years ago to the recent XE V2 problem, the truth is simple: we still have a lot to improve. No excuses. Our goal is to be a brand that people can feel confident buying from. So when something goes wrong, we offer full refunds or extra compensation to those willing to wait for us to fix the issue. We want to make sure our customers don’t suffer any financial loss.

If we’ve let down the people who support VAXEE, I sincerely apologize. We’re also stepping up our quality control. After all, no one is happy just because they got a refund or compensation. And VAXEE definitely won’t use those backup plans as an excuse to allow quality problems to continue. It might not sound new or exciting, but the only thing we can do is keep working hard to get better.

【Closing words】
This post isn’t to make excuses or say VAXEE is flawless. I just wanted to explain our current state honestly. We have plenty of shortcomings—that’s why our company motto is “continual improvement.” We want every team member to acknowledge their flaws and work on them.

We can’t compete in the rules set by giant brands or retailers. If we blindly follow, we risk going bankrupt—that would be irresponsible. So we go back to basics: clearly explain what a product does. If it fits your needs, buy it. If there’s an issue, we’ll help. Simple. But we’ll keep improving product and service quality.

We don’t sell emotional value. So we avoid empty adjectives like “world’s best” or “fastest.” We explain what features do and what problems they solve.

Many companies today talk about 'sustainable management,' and VAXEE is one of them. But let’s be real, I won’t live long enough to see VAXEE become a century-old company. However, just because I can’t see it doesn’t mean I shouldn’t care. If I say that I hope to accompany VAXEE’s supporters into their 50s, 60s, and 70s, that would be a lie. I believe that honest and transparent communication is the ticket to sustainable management. This post may help VAXEE's supporters understand the company better, but it might also cause those with misconceptions to distance themselves from VAXEE. But when we return to the goal of sustainable management, whether or not you agree with VAXEE’s values, VAXEE will never wear a mask or disguise itself. The path of lying or trying to cover things up is not a long-lasting one.

This post may help VAXEE supporters understand the brand more deeply, or it might drive away those who have misunderstood VAXEE. But if we return to the core of sustainability, no matter whether you agree with VAXEE’s values or not, VAXEE will not wear a mask or pretend to be something it’s not. A path built on lies or cover-ups cannot be walked for long.

I’m already in my 50s, and before long, I’ll be in my 60s and 70s. But under the concept of sustainable operation, no matter how old I am, every day is just a new beginning. To prevent myself and the VAXEE team from feeling like we’re chasing a goal with no finish line, the only way is to stay focused on “continual improvement”.

This post is meant to help VAXEE supporters better understand our goals and help our team remember what kind of company they work for. Those who share our philosophy should never accept a shift in mindset. Only with consistency can we go far, together.",7,1748078035.0,MouseReview,1,0.89,False

I was 2 visits in a my psychiatrist cut my meds and wasn't going to give them back without 6 months of clean drug screens. I had cancelled my visits w her because I had transportation problems and I requested telehralth so I can get to my appts. But I was looking in my records afterwards and my record is so full of lies. The psychiatrist said she cut my meds after she lectured me and told me I had to comply and that because I didn't give a UDS screen she was taking my med but that id randomly drop and CC one infor therapy with her. Well, NONE of that happened. I told her I had done something 2 weeks ago and then once that day before I came in and she rolled her eyes and said ""I need to get help that will interfere with your meds"" & I said ok. She put in my records I drink coffee and smoke cigarettes too and I have never done either in my life. She had about 12 errors in there and I wrote up a letter to ask for a retraction or I'm going to have my PCP put my letter to her in my records and then report it. She taped my session and never said she was,call kinds of shady sht. I'm sure w me being honest about that I may get a dual diag. But here's the thing, I can just stop. I do it cause I just hit it for my nerves occasionally but I go many days and don't mess w it at all so I don't need a rehab, I'm positive I can quit on the spot. So now, I'm going to a new psych on telehealth, im going to tell him I quit so is he gonna do the same sht to me and come at me like a warden cause I was using or will I have to show some form of rehab? My PCP gives me both my meds, if it even starts looking like they are going to try that on me again, I'll walk out. I might be in a crisis but I don't really want a psychiatrist and I don't want talk therapy. I just want my meds and time to try to heal. I got such ugly locked away in me I don't wanna bring forth inner child, personality disordered, guilt ridden, failed, neurotic, psychotic, psychosis broken me. I know she's in there and she's codependent, anxious, sad, a little frozen up, but she's a realist and She's a substance user occasionally, no daily or weekly. This is retarddd to navigate already and I'm 2 visits in having to give the psychiatrist the giddy up. But I zero fkd given to tell them to step off with that warden, forced treatment no chances given B.S.   uh-huh No Hunty child she got #cancelled just in time.  What do these hoo has think is gonna happen next month after we run out of those meds? It should be a crime to just jerk meds without offering once to let them seek treatment in some form. They are trying to kill us. 
I'm just leaning towards staying w my PCP and skipping the talking and the head shrink. Can I do that or do I have to get diagnosed again by the new one.

You ever just lock eyes with someone for a split second and feel like it's communication on a level we don't quite understand? Like...just a look, but it speaks volumes? It happened to me the other day while sipping my coffee at a local cafe. This woman just walked by, and for a brief moment, we exchanged this glance. It wasn't a stare, more like a whisper that lingered for just a moment.

I can't help but wonder what she was thinking, and I guess it's wild how much power this fleeting, everyday occurrence can hold. Was it curiosity, kindness, or maybe she just noticed my shirt was inside out? It's odd how much can hang in the air from something as simple as eye contact.

Anyway, I guess I'm realizing that these small encounters make me ponder life's unsolved questions. Like, how many of these moments do we let slip past us? Do we really see each other, or are we all just drifting by, caught up in our own worlds? Might not make a big difference in the grand scheme of things, but it kinda left me wondering....who are all these people we pass by each day?

The weather is horrible today, so as I drink my coffee I decided to cast the net out again today, as I'm still keen to connect with some more genuinely supportive and interesting people. I'm a 36-year-old fella from the UK, around to chat pretty often, and would really love to find a few friendly souls to share the everyday rhythms with, explore our passions, and hopefully build some proper connections based on good old-fashioned understanding and a bit of a laugh.

*   **Art (Drawing & Painting!):** Love both the process of creating and the joy of appreciating what others make. It's always a journey of discovery!
*   **Reading:** There's nothing quite like getting lost in a good book and seeing the world through different perspectives.
*   **Traveling:** Experiencing new cultures and broadening horizons is something I hugely value.
*   **Gym:** Keeping active helps keep both body and mind feeling good.
*   **Video Games:** Enjoy the social side, the escapism, and the great storytelling in games.
*   **Learning Languages:** Currently wrestling (in the best way!) with French and Japanese – it's fascinating to unlock new ways to communicate.
*   **Coffee & Tea:** A simple, good cuppa is one of life's great, quiet pleasures, isn't it?

I'm really hoping to find people who value open and honest chats, a good dose of empathy, and enjoy sharing life's moments – the big wins, the small joys, and even just the everyday stuff. I pride myself on being a good listener and genuinely aim to be a supportive and understanding mate.

Yes, I lay on the drawing room floor in a defiant display of a pretend nap. I continued my performance for a spectacular 15 minutes. And no, I didn’t actually manage to catch another wink of sweet sleep after 7.

But why does one wake up moody? I think it’s a deeply existential phenomenon, more real than most phenomena anyway, and everyone references it's realness in some way. The neurobiologist calls it the cortisol spike. The coffee drinker says, “Don’t talk to me until I’ve had my morning coffee.” Pete Walker, in his book *Complex PTSD*, notes that his clients often wake up triggered with trauma for “no reason whatsoever.” Just ask your parents about how you, as a kid, acted out when woken up for school. Why? I say it’s because, instinctively, we realize the sweet abyss of sleep is far superior to the brutal crudeness of life. Freud called dreams wish-fulfillments, wouldn’t it be nice to have your wish fulfilled, even in a dream? To have that sweet reverie broken? That’s enough to make you angsty. To have what fulfills you snatched away? Disgusting. You’re morally obligated to throw a tantrum! Even if you wake from a nightmare, like Gregor Samsa did from his uneasy dreams in Kafka’s story, you’d realize: the horrors of real life trump nightmares every time.

And so, like any sane man, I tried to delude myself and the world that I was still asleep, even though I was awake.

then I actually I woke up, sulked around, pooped, skipped breakfast, mopped the floor, had my coffee, bathed, and cooked lunch, well, partly. My mother did the rest.

Mother, oh mother, woe is her. I feel bad for her, stuck with a tyrant and a son as futile as a philosopher, or perhaps worse, as useless as a self-help book, maybe even as ineffective as CBT on a crackhead. But Mother inspires me, a lot. She works so hard, every single day, day after day. The house is a home because of her. Well, not quite, but I’ll say this: because of her, people, including me, find it hard to distinguish our “home” from a real one. She takes everything on her shoulders and makes Atlas look like a sissy. She carries the burden of everyone’s life, for what? For me? For Dad? We don’t deserve it. He certainly doesn’t. At least I have the decency to feel guilty about it; he only feels entitled. Even so, I don’t deserve it. My sister is the only person in this so-called home who remotely resembles someone capable and deserving of love. Why does Mother do it for me? Maybe she still has hope that I’m worthy of something. It makes me cry just thinking about it as I type. My eyes well up with tears, but God forbid I feel my feelings like a normal person. No, I must write a confession drenched in irony and metaphors, performing my pain in melodramatic soliloquies instead of feeling it.

I’m a Muslim woman (in my 20s) who really values certain principles—modesty, faith, and emotional boundaries. I’m reaching out because I’m in a bit of an emotional spiral and could use an outside perspective.

Here’s the backstory:

About 4 years ago, I was friends with a guy who was… not my type at all. He was deep into the partying scene—drinking, smoking, clubbing—the whole lifestyle that clashed hard with my values. I’m a hijabi, I don’t drink or party, and back then I was also struggling a lot with my self-esteem (I weighed 99 kg at the time and now he saw me after I lost 31kgs). To complicate matters, he liked my best friend and even talked about marrying her, but then he betrayed her trust badly—and used me in the process as an emotional go-between. I was furious. They stopped talking, and I cut him off too.

Fast forward two years—my friend forgave him. I never did. But recently, I heard from someone else that he’s changed a lot. Apparently, he left his toxic lifestyle, found Islam, and is trying to become a better person.

Curious (and maybe wanting closure), I reached out to him. We met for coffee and talked for 3-4 hours. And it was… different.

He admitted he was in the wrong, apologized for his past, and talked about his personal growth. He told me about leaving a toxic job, distancing from bad influences, and how he’s now praying, reading, and trying to realign his life with faith. We also talked about life, families, and relationships—he gave me advice on finding a good man, saying to look for someone who fears Allah, and that religious actions without sincerity mean nothing.

It was all very mature and respectful. He even said he doesn’t believe men and women can be just friends anymore, because usually one side has feelings (ironic, I know). At the end of the day, he told me I could reach out anytime if I needed advice or support. He hasn’t texted since, but when I said, “We probably can’t go back to being normal friends,” he suggested we could be “acquaintances” or “therapists” for each other.

Here’s my dilemma:
	•	I don’t know if he sees me that way now, or if he was just being polite and nice.
	•	Part of me wants to message him again, maybe casually follow up on something we talked about (like a religious question).
	•	But I’m tired of being the one who reaches out first. I already initiated the reconnection, and I don’t want to be the “nuisance” or feel like I’m chasing someone who’s not interested.

At the same time… I can’t stop thinking about him. It’s so confusing because I never had feelings for him before, but now—after seeing him changed—it feels like we’re aligned in values and maybe could work.

So, Reddit—should I text him? Or let it go and move on?

Hi all.

49M - I'm having a hard time meeting deadlines for work at the moment. The worst it's ever been in my life. Feeling like I'm letting my co-workers down big time. And, yeah... I'm on Reddit posting stuff 😂😭

I started Citalopram a year ago on my doctor's advice. I was anxious to the point of breaking down in tears. Sat in my car a few times on the work parking lot in the morning thinking ""I can't do this. I can't do this"" but mustering enough willpower to make it through the day. Feeling like I couldn't cope, and that included issues at home which we're addressing as a family. It's fine btw.

I knew citalopram and booze didn't mix well. But I did drink on the meds and even noticed that I drank faster and knocked down a lot of beers on weeknights, etc.

Mentioned it to my doc. He said, ""Yeah. No booze."".

So... I kept drinking, and it started spiralling out of control until mid-January, when I pulled the plug.

I tried to explain the increase in drinking as a side effect of Citalopram...

Apparently, in most cases, it's not that:

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6441125/

Having cut down on alcohol, I'm feeling better, but noticed that my smoking (tobacco) and screen time increased.

I have deadlines I've known about for the last month. I've always done things at the last minute, and I've now clearly identified I have procrastinating patterns when deadlines are looming. The last three weeks,
I've been avoiding stuff, posting on Reddit, taking lots of coffee and cigarette breaks when working at home...

Last night, I just couldn't concentrate. I sandwiched 10 minutes work then 10 minutes Internet research. Repeated. Found the willpower to finish one big task.

Anyway. One thing hit me. I did an online ADHD test because I keep thinking that all this isn't my fault. I've also met young adults in my line of work who've discussed their ADHD patterns, the impact on their lives, their misdiagnoses and stuff...

Turns out that I fit the criteria very strongly. I shall be seeking medical/psychological advice shortly (I have appointments lined up).

I think Citalopram upped my impulsivity/inattention related to (potential) ADHD. That made me more vulnerable to having that second (third, fourth, fifth...) drink when I was spiralling. Or the increased inattention and procrastinating (and associated restlessness/anxiety) led me to seek out the comfort of alcohol.

Any similar experiences? Am I on to something?

It caught me off guard, but I remember feeling this huge wave of warm fuzzies right after. It's kinda funny how such a tiny thing from a complete stranger made my morning so much brighter.

I guess it's all about this thing called the ""compliment effect."" When someone goes out of their way to say something nice, it triggers a release of dopamine—yep, that's the happy chemical our brain loves. Even if it's a simple remark, it somehow tells you you're seen, appreciated, and valued in some way. That's why even a small, unexpected compliment can have a big impact on our mood.

I used to be sorta shy about complimenting people, but I realized how much it means, especially when it seems unprompted. So now, if I think something nice, I usually try to say it out loud. You never know—it might just be the highlight of someone's day.",5,1748076101.0,brainBehaves,0,1.0,False

I know I’m the one getting “physical abuse” (I’m a dude so she can’t hurt me, but someone told me it’s a bit insane apparently.) I was a blackout alcoholic for like 6 years and 2 of those years I spent telling her to her face that I was sober while eating a burger like hasselhof. The amount of empty vodka pints that we cleaned out of my hiding spots was… embarrassing. Anyway. I quit. Went dry two years, through covid. Got a dog and made a couple coffee tables. Started drinking again. But “responsibly” which I define as not lying about it. Im feeling like she controls me.  She broke my nose my throwing an ottoman at me. We don’t have any ottomans anymore… she’s destroyed a piece of art my mother made for us. A big painting… which I’m mad that I forgave her for. I love her family…. Writing this makes it clearer. But.

1ku6wkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ku6wkt/my_mom_treats_me_like_her_surrogate_husband_its/,"My mom treats me like her surrogate husband, its really disturbing","My mom sometimes talks to me and treats me like I am her new husband,

For example she criticizes me for ""not seeing her hints"", for example a few days ago, she said she was going to do a chore, apparently I was supposed to hear this and think ""I need to do that chore, not her"" (I didnt even hear it because I was busy working in my room)

Later she explained that she shouldnt have to tell me directly to do a chore, that to ""please her""\* I have to do chores for her, I told her that if she wants something she has to directly ask me (if she asked me I would have done it of course)

\*(btw I dont want to please her, she is rarely nice to me, mostly negative and talking ill of me)

She even tried to make me feel guilty on how she did and effort and went outside to get ingredients for lunch for me and my sibling (it was me who cooked but whatever)

Maybe I am insane (I know I gaslight myself a lot) but to me this is very similar to what a wife could typically do to her husband ""I shouldnt have to ask you to do x"" while I agree in a couple it is different, especially if there is a tone of chores, but here it was only one chore, an easy and quick one

I would understand that a woman would get mad at her husband for example never giving her gifts or things she likes, because you dont really ask for gifts for example, but again that would be different because I am not married to MY MOM

She also asks me to take a lot of decision for herself, even such minor ones it actually annoys me that she talks to me just to ask this ""should I wear x or y"" ""Should I call the doc"" ""Should I drink a coffee now or not"" I feel like shes being so needy

She also vents a lot to me, especially about her job, money, her divorce, my dad, other family members , about random people, especially about women

Sometimes we walk in the street or whatever and she grabs my arm like a woman do to her boyfriend, but thats very minor compared to the rest of what I have explained, I think

So what do you think? Is this emotional incest (I have learned about this word recently and it makes me sick when I connected it to the way my mom behaves) or am I just overexaggerating? I need external advice on my situation as I cant talk about it to anyone, thank you for reading.

(A movie becomes interesting if you start with routine plots and then twist the narrative in the interval block!)

* Initials: M.R.V. (as per GoI documents)
* Height: 5'7""
* Education: B.Tech + M.B.A
* Current Designation: Senior Sales & Operations Analyst
* Earnings: enough to interest IT authorities but not enough to bother between new and old tax regimes
* Native: Kochi, Kerala
* Caste (if that matters): Nair
* Languages known: English, Hindi, Gujarati, Malayalam (know a few others too but just bare minimum for conversing with auto-wallahs or shopkeeprs)
* Current Location: Bengaluru (Nam ooru......)

*Something interesting or boring about me?*

I used to mimic a famous Bollywood star's dance moves (from his debut movie) as a kid. My mom caught me once dancing in the mirror and her forward thinking landed me in a dance class. Ever since, I just break into some moves the moment I hear a nice song. So you will never be short of personal entertainment!

The first ever football match I saw live was the UCL final 2008. Imagine a 11 year old kid just happens to watch the most dramatic football match in his first attempt and the Red team wins it too. Perhaps, mirrors both my acads and United's journey, since then. Both have plummeted to great depths. But we don't give up on each other. (Brownie points for loyalty??)

There are many other such interesting stories that have played catalysts for crucial turning points in my life. Maybe, I can brew you my special coffee while storytelling those funny anecdotes. And yea, won't run out of my repository anytime soon.

*What am I looking for?*

A companion, a soul-mate, a partner? Can't tag a particular name to them but I definitely know what they would mean to me. 

On a cozy evening, when it rains, they would be sharing a coffee/tea with me. Silence filled with understanding and love filled glances at each other. Or when we both return home after a tiring day at work, and suddenly a groovy song plays, we both attack the dance floor! Or holding each other's hands and going for a long walk at night, discussing anything and everything under the moon! (There are other scenarios in my old-school romantic brain that we can play out together!)

Every evening, she collapses onto me, oblivious to the puffs of my once regal upholstery escaping into thin air like whispers of protests. It's not that I mind supporting her—it’s just, have you ever considered the sheer tyranny of crumbs tickling your fibers and the perpetual fear of coffee stains? There's the added humiliation of the cat mistaking my armrest for an idle scratching post—my dignity shredded with every misplaced paw. They don't see it, but my little joy stems from the whispers of the past, from when I was fresh and firm. Once in a while, a sunny afternoon's warm rays grace my threadbare seat, and I daydream of grand parlors and genteel gatherings.

I have posted the full story on a different sub-reddit if you are curious but the short story:

2 months ago my wife broke up with me. It came sudden. We had no obvious issues in our relationship, had what I thought healthy communication, enjoyed spending time with each other. Honestly the best kind of relationship I got imagine. Now after 3 years (1y married) it's gone. 

The reasons for leaving are primarily on her. She feels like she doesn't even know herself anymore and what she wants out of life. I don't see a reason for separation in that but it is what it is. Now 2 weeks ago, after a long period of almost no contact, we had a long walk and talk to see what are the next steps. She said she thought long about it and still has all her issues, is seeing a therapist and still thinks our relationship was wonderful and would like to make it work. After that there was no further engagement from her side. Every time I ask her to meet for dinner oder a coffee she is busy.

On my side I cried a lot. Am I the perfect husband? Probably not, but humans are imperfect. I tried to visit a therapist because of this breakup. My main issue is that I am feeling like I am putting so much work into this relationship right now, wanting to make it work but I don't see or feel the same effort from her. I understand that she has those personal issues and they have a higher priority for her than us/me. Thats difficult und Hurts. The therapist is also not really helping me in sorting out my feelings. After 4 sessions I still feel like we are running circles, talking about the same and asking the same question. ""What do you need right now to move on"" - I don't know. I came here to figure that out 😅

I don't have the courage or resolve to break it up. When I think about making mentally the cut with her, I feel bad. The time together was great and honestly I would loved it to stay like this until the end but it takes two to have a relationship.

So here I am. A mess who can't end this relationship on its own because I genuinely believe it is worth saving. Sitting here and waiting for her to either end it or working on it.

Any advice?",1,1748074937.0,Healthygamergg,2,1.0,False
1ku6ony,https://i.redd.it/9hpj1wm8wo2f1.jpeg,Starting from scratch (again) and looking for Oolongs & Greens that take Western brewing,"This is my very favorite tea cup.  I love everything about it, but the size is part of my issue; It's 12oz/.35L but more on that later...  

Sadly, I've lost all my tea supplies *(don't ask)* so I'm starting anew with only grocery store tea bags and this strainer.  Can't stand it, I NEED better tea, but I've been scrolling for days and ..yada-yada choice paralysis.  

I used to buy from pre-Starbucks Teavana, so even my source is gone! 😭
Thankfully, I didn't buy the fruity/flavored stuff just an Oolong, Jasmine Dragon Pearls (easily found) and the Samurai/Mata Chai blend which TeaLeaves sells.
 
But it's the Oolong that I loved the most, can't remember the name of (NOT Monkey Picked), and I'm having trouble replacing.  
Here's what I know:  
• The brew color of light iced tea  
• It was rolled into clumps that unfurled during brewing  
• It was medium oxidized and leaves were a darker green but still clearly green  
• If it was roasted, it was super light  
• The smell was rich & flowery  
• More ""oolong"" while hot, sweeter as it cooled    
• Tasted of stone fruit and honey  
(but I always put a little Stevia in it, Truvia specifically -- which I only use for grapefruit and this tea bc the Truvia balanced out a underlying bitterness in both foods more than sugar or honey do-- but the bitterness might've been bc I brewed it wrong)  

If you know what oolong that was, or one that might fit that description, let me know.  

**Now for the cup problem**  
During my research, for most of the oolongs that look promising, the description says:  
***""gong fu brewing suggested""*** or similar  

I have a 12oz tea mug.  That's 3x of the 100ml gong fu size portion.  
I want to drink my tea like I drink my coffee: make a cup, sit, enjoy, maybe go back for more later.  I can't be going back & forth to brew every other sip; especially bc I'm making tea for 2 (and he wants green)  

In closing: 
If anyone knows the name of that old Teavana oolong, or the real Chinese name for it, or one that's at least similar to the one I mentioned (sweet, floral, medium dark brew, low roast, rolled dark green leaves, invokes a complex honey & peach iced tea, ***that can also be made grandpa-style or Western  
That would be super 👍


Also, if you know of a higher caffeine, classic sweet-ish green tea, or an oolong a green tea drinker might like, that would be cool too.  

Maybe I can try gong fu in the future if we're both drinking the same thing.  
But for now I get my hot water from a Ninja coffee maker where my only options are ""Hot"" (165-175F), ""Boil"" (180-195F), & ""Keep Warm"" (170-175F) so my options are limited.  

I know it's a lot, but this is what I've been chewing on for the last 3-4 days and at this point?  The only thing left is to talk it out. ",1,1748074926.0,tea,2,1.0,False

Quick description:

Female with anger issues when triggered, usually I'm in a good mood and like to joke around.

I like being outside. With friends, without friends. That doesn't matter. Drinking coffee or just strolling around. Observing people when they do something stupid and laughing internally. When I'm at home, I like reading. Manga, Terry Pratchett or books about psychology or anything that caught my eye. I'm naturally curious and want to know a lot of things. For example I have a huge knowledge about Dinosaurs and air planes without having anything to do with them beside use them for travelling. 

Nonetheless I like the thrill of actions and after a day sitting around I get bored and need something to do.

I don't plan anything. I just take everything how I get it. Usually you can ask me for help and I come over right away.
