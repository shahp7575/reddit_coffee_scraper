Do you take any meds on an as-needed basis?,"So some background: I was put on a lot of psych meds without my consent as an adolescent. I was misdiagnosed. It's amazing to me now, twenty years later, that no one really asked me what my life was like. I was constantly sent back to my abusive family, and so obviously despite whatever meds I was on it didn't really make a difference. I just became slower mentally and physically, angry and numb.

I was able to taper off my meds in my early 20s. My life improved a lot. My major depression, panic disorder, all of these practically vanished when I moved out of my parents unstable house. I had a few good years, but everything took a dark turn however when my boyfriend's roommate raped me when I was 26.

Because of this experience, plus not being believed or feeling protected in the direct aftermath, I developed very debilitating PTSD. Then add court trauma to this, a decade later, when I was trying to do the right thing and protect other people from this psychopath. More trauma was all I got for that. 

I don't work anymore, except I am trying to finish my first novel. I've refused meds over the years because of the time I was a teenager but also because when I tried them later on I felt sedated and empty. I can't focus on my writing that way. I write via coffee and reading every day.

So I wondering if anyone takes a medication on an as needed basis? I went to a dinner party last night and I got a ton of flashbacks. Someone asked if I had an eye disorder and then this made me have a panic attack. (When I'm nervous and in PTSD mode my eyes cannot focus and I'll look around the room, I totally get why people bring up eyes but wow, does that not help!).

I want to have a more robust social life, I usually drink a few beers but sometimes when they're wearing off I feel the panic all over again.",1,1748124358.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

Need advice!,"Guitar experience:  I started playing guitar when I started high school. Played in a band with some classmates all through high school then just kept noodling for fifteen years. Finally joined a casual band last year and been rehearsing a couple of songs with them.

Style and gear: In terms of style, I mostly play (not sure about nomenclature anymore) dad rock, boomer rock etc. Basically whatever's been called rock going from AC/DC to the Foo Fighters. Got a S style guitar with a few pedals including a looper (boss RC) and a TC electronic flashback which also has some looping capabilities.

With that out of the way, the context is that my wife has a small coffee-shop and wants me to play on her terrace for an upcoming event (end of June) in town where amateur musicians are welcome to perform on the streets. My band mates aren't available so I can't have them join me for this.

I was thinking I could do something solo, just me with my guitar. I don't want it to be too boring though, so I was thinking I could use the looper to play some backing tracks and play some improv (not fully, I'd rehearse the main themes) over those. However, I'm a bit lost as to how I should approach this.

Should I create loops live, then play over them?
Should I come with pre-recorded loops?
If I use pre-recorded loops, should they be fully played by me or can I (as in, is it fair game) just load backing tracks from the internet onto my RC looper?
Can I play full songs like this or should I focus on riffs, solos from well known songs and build around those themes/lines?

Lots of questions from an amateur musician as you can see. It feels super vague to me. Any feedback/ideas/suggestions welcome.

Thanks in advance!",1,1748124210.0,Guitar,0,1.0,False

I'm avisually impaired beer geek with a love of quality coffee and a hypereclectic music taste. Total history buff, chronic train trip planner. I roll dice to decide my destination or next drink, want to play? You're more than welcome. I enjoy the gym although you wouldn't know it and  junk food, you would know that. I'm around 6 ft tall (1.83m), 20 stone [280lbs 128kg) because even though I love the gym, I love the fridge even more. An extravert. I'm always up for going places and chatting away to all sorts of people and it's no exaggeration to say I have friends all over the world.

My voice is my best feature and I'm always happy to voice verify that I'm real through the Vocaroo website. I'd like you to do the same in return because I can't see pictures very well. Also you might have an attractive voice and I want to hear it. Yes I do have a Scottish accent but I think you'll understand me just fine.

Making friends is perfectly acceptable and that's where I'd like to start every time but ultimately we all know why many of us are here . Looking for some casual fun but open to a relationship. I prefer the softness of a plus sized woman but it is just a preference. A cosy woman of any size is welcome to message if this all appeals. I adore cuddles and snuggles. If you've ever been told that your need for physical touch and affection is ""too much"", turn it up a lot and I'll meet you half way., I prefer to take quiet charge in our most lovely moments so I hope you enjoy that. If we do end up in a relationship, I want the Works. Marriage, kids etc but let's walk before we can run though and maybe a casual thing is all it will be.

I'm just kind of gaming things out. 


How it might happen slowly: the more people talk about it, and the more some try to portray them as victims, demanding higher minimum wages which makes owners raise their prices or enact surcharges, and perhaps the more everyone everywhere starts asking for tips, people just more and more start talking about ending or reducing tips. 

The more people question it and discuss the possibility of not tipping or tipping less, the more socially acceptable it becomes. People start tipping less or not tipping such that staff demands more pay from business owner. Business owner obliges in order to keep employees, and raises prices.

People soon see the new prices and feel the need to tip less to make it affordable. Eventually, it just becomes perfectly socially acceptable and most people don't tip or maybe tip a few bucks for good service. Wages find their point necessary for workers to keep working, and it's done. 

Is that conceivable? I certainly don't see it happening yet. But there's been a lot of talk about it, high minimum wage laws, and now the new tax reduction which is going to make people perhaps a little resentful?

How it happens all at once: maybe not in an instant but over the course of a couple of weeks or a month, after talking about it, a sizable minority of people just decide they want to stop tipping. Maybe some celebrity or viral video starts and declares a certain day, let's say April 15th, or July 4th, Independence Day from tipping. A lot of people start doing it like 20 or 30% maybe? 

Once it gains momentum, other people start feeling they can do it. Still others might not want to but restaurant owners start raising wages because otherwise their employees are just going to quit. They raise their prices but go to great pains to explain that they are paying good wages to their employees, maybe even sharing the amount, and diners and drinkers etc begin to realize that they don't have to tip, but still some might because they want to be nice or they like the server or want to reward particularly good service. Servers walk out with 10 or 20 bucks in their pocket, enough to buy a drink after work or a coffee in the morning or breakfast and they count on their paycheck to pay the bills. 

Do either scenarios seem possible? Do either seem impossible? I'm not advocating for either, I'm just wondering if it could happen or might happen. Or could it happen some other way? Owners going tip free or something like that? 

How many servers would stay in the profession I wonder? Asuming that they can command pay based on what they are worth to the owner. Anyway curious of people's thoughts",0,1748124036.0,tipping,0,0.25,False

She left early to go to the airport. With me working late and her leaving early she slept on the couch. I awoke to a kiss on my forehead and a goodbye. A few hours later¬† I woke up. She had sent a picture of the airport all lit up and an ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù An I love you? I haven‚Äôt gotten one of those in awhile. It felt good.¬†

I went to the kitchen and turned the coffee pot on. I let the dogs out, then back in and went to the living room. I turned the computer on (we use it for TV) then over to the television. Near the power button was a folded piece of paper. In front was the cut out of a cat that reads ‚ÄúMine.‚Äù

We had an inside joke awhile ago of a heart she made. On one side it said Mine. On the other it said Yours. We would place this heart all throughout the house or apartment that we lived in throughout the years. In sock drawers, medicine cabinets, etc. Just a little something to let the other know you were thinking of them. The heart was lost in one of our moves. I recently made the cat and had been passing it around.¬†

Things haven‚Äôt been easy lately. In the last year she discovered she was asexual. It was a huge blow but I respected her and was willing to work with it. I realized it wasn‚Äôt that she was not sexually attracted to me but was not sexually attracted to anyone. Recently she has made comments about how she‚Äôs bi polar and I recommended she not make a self diagnosis and seek the help of a professional. I‚Äôve been attempting to get her to see a professional for quite some time but there always seems to be excuses. I‚Äôm the emotional one. I‚Äôm the one that attempts to communicate. In her letter she said she feels I deserve better. Someone that can accept my adoration, love, and kindness. She is unable to do so and unwilling to compromise. There is a strong tone of figuring out who she is and how happy she  is that she realized it. She is not one for any type of intimacy from any one and it has been stressing her out trying to fit this mold of what she thinks I want her to be. We've moved to a new town and have been her for a year. We just recently have both found stable employment we're happy with. We bought a small one bedroom house last spring.I've given her affection. I've given her space. I've tried to be the best human I possibly can and it isn't enough. I'm poor. I'm almost 50 and we're in a house we can afford but only with the both of us working. I have no real friends here.

She'll be back Monday night and I'm still processing the way I feel. I called into work. I'm trying to let the hurt, hurt but I'll need to go back to work tomorrow. I'm abstaining from texting her as I don't want to do any of this over text. I find it unbelievable that nothing can be resolved but that is likely the hopeless romantic in me.

I went through a divorce at 35 and started over from scratch. It feels so overwhelming to have to try again. I'm lost, worried, and sad. I've tried to do all the right things and it feels like it just isn't good enough. Fuck it hurts. I feel like a failure. (I know it will pass and things will get better but right now, in the moment I'm aching.) Thanks for letting me vent.",10,1748123764.0,GuyCry,3,1.0,False

Gaduating from a T10 college and would appreciate some advice.

At the start of last semester, I learned about equity research as a promising career path. Since then, I've read up on the industry, had a few coffee chats, and have confirmed that I would like to pursue the career path.  The issue is this - I am about to gradute and need a job.

Should I continue focusing on sell-side ER roles? Would it be more realistic to find an adjacent role? And if so, what other roles should I look at?

For some background, most of my internships and experiences are in finance and programming. I am a college senior graduating in two weeks.

1kumtv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kumtv3/how_can_i_fix_this_situation_with_my_colleague/,How can i fix this situation with my Colleague?,"I (27M) met a colleague (28F) from work which on a social night out last month, we got on super well and started messaging back and forth for a few weeks on Teams, i might be joining her team soon, so might work closely with her.

On Tuesday 6 of us met and went out to a social activity, this was the first stop, so we were pretty sober still. She said you look a bit like my ex but much more attractive', which suggests I'm her type. She also made sure I had her number, and named herself in my phone as 'favorite person ever'.

After the social activity, we went to a bar and 3 people left, so it was me, her and 'frank' who's a mutual friend (she said he's like an annoying cousin, certain it's a platonic friendship) , we kept drinking and then she eventually sat on my lap and would touch my hands etc.

Eventually 'Frank' left at around 11PM, me and her stayed out and went to another bar, eventually we decided to just walk around the city and she grabbed my hand and we wandered for hours just talking, laughing and being flirty - we clicked really well. We stayed out until 2:30AM, and called separate Taxis home.  
We texted in the taxis how we both had a nice time and really enjoyed spending time together. The next few days, we were texting non-stop about everything, with cute emojis, teasing etc. (sort of flirty).

on Thursday we had a phone call for an hour the same vibe from texting continued, and she said she's going to be in the office on Friday and said I should come because she'll be there, I then asked her if she wanted to do something after work and she said yes.

On Friday (Yesterday), at the end of the work day, I went and found her (didn't hug her, because we were in the office), and we went to the bar near by, for what I thought was a date-like situation, she then said 'I should invite 'frank'' my ADHD kicked in and I started overthinking it so I suddenly thought 'oh, this is 100% platonic'.

'Frank' couldn't come so it was just us two. I went into it thinking it was just friends hanging out, I wasn't flirty with her, didn't really touch her, didn't give any indication that I like her because I didn't want to make her uncomfortable as I thought this was suddenly a platonic thing.  
However, we did laugh and talk for 6 hours at this bar when she eventually said she needs to go home (around 9:30PM).

We both got on the same train and sat next to each other, when it was time for me to get off, I felt it'd be too awkward to hug her as the arm rest was in the way and there were people standing in front of us, so i kinda just said 'cya'.

I'm kicking myself so badly because I overthought the situation about this girl I'm into and kept it strictly platonic and didn't let it see where it could go.

This morning I sent her a message and she hasn't even opened it, which is completely different to how it was before and I believe it's because she was expecting more/for it to be flirty like Tuesday.

What would you recommend I do? Ultimately I want a re-do of Friday and we actually get to know each other instead of me biting my tongue and keeping it platonic, which I believe would've been reciprocated looking back at the situation/all the obvious signs which i missed.

I've written out a message I was tempted to send, or I can wait until Tuesday and ask if she wants to get a coffee in the office.

This is the message I was prepped:

Sooo I‚Äôve gotta admit something ‚Äî I went into our drinks thinking it might be a bit of a see if we get along/semi-date kinda thing‚Ä¶ But when you invited 'Frank', my ADHD kicked in like ‚Äòah shit, this is 100% platonic.‚Äô So I basically friend-zoned myself to avoid misreading things. But now I‚Äôm realizing I overthought the whole thing which is very standard, basically, I like you - I‚Äôm just an idiot.

Please let me know what you think is the best way to salvage this and try again :)

TL;DR:

Met a work colleague at a social night, we hit it off and started flirting over text. After a fun night out where she got really touchy and flirty, we kept chatting non-stop. We agreed to meet after work, but when she said she will invite our mutual friend, my ADHD brain overthought it and I assumed it was just a friendly hangout. I held back flirting, kept it platonic, and now she hasn‚Äôt even opened my message the next day. I think I misread the signs and missed the chance.",1,1748123556.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

We got three drinks:

1. A panda milk - very mild pandan flavored creamy drink
2. Mango passion fruit tea with mixed fruit jelly (at 50% sweetness)
3. Guava coco juice with mango popping boba (also at 50% sweet)

Everyone loved their drinks. They were gorgeous, which you would expect from a $7 drink. We got exactly what we ordered, the fruit tea and juice also contained bits of fruit.

Although this shopping center is busy there's plenty of parking on this end. The shop itself is actually a pretty decent place too enjoy your drinks or maybe work online for a little while, but we got them to go.

The price is okay, about on par with every other boba/specialty coffee place (about $7 a drink, I did end up adding a tip but I think they deserved it because they helped me find something I would enjoy and went out of their way to make sure I was happy). They did ask me to write a review on Google, which I haven't done yet but will. They're just getting started so I can understand the pressure even though I did found it a little annoying.

Ultimately, I'm pretty picky and there are a lot of tea places competing for business. The service and selection definitely bump them to the top of my list.

We cannot paint the walls because we rent, so please no comments saying to paint. Also- the paintings are oddly high up on the walls because our 1 cat loves to knock them down and this way its out of her reach.

 The thought right now is to move the TV against the wall where the scratching post is. Switch couch positions so they each go where the other one is- except move them closer in toward the tv and away from the wall. Also will be moving the white rug and middle coffee table horizontally to align with the new tv area. The cat fountain and treehouse we are thinking should stay in the same place or perhaps move to the corner where the tv is now? 

This also leaves a mini hallway area behind the couch that is currently against the wall, so to fill that space we are thinking a little book shelf and maybe a big fake plant there. With moving the couch away from the wall I really want to move the green forest painting to above the TV on the opposite wall instead. My hubby thinks this is a bad idea and he wants to keep the current wall decor up where the white squares and rush picture is.

1kumo9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1kumo9k/any_other_emotional_affairs_out_there/,Any other emotional affairs out there?,"I've been lurking on this sub for a couple of months, trying to decide if I belong here. After reading several threads yesterday, I've decided I do, and created this alt account.

Like some of the threads I read, I never expected to be in this situation, and I'm not even all the way there, but I sure as hell understand a lot more about why people have affairs.

I've been married for over 30 years to a man that I no long feel much for. The reason I've stayed is that he has a long term incurable neurological illness which has disabled him and things will only get worse from here. I'm here because I feel responsible to take care of him for as long as possible, although I realize at some point he will probably require full time nursing care.

If he were someone I was still in love with, this would be much simpler, but over the years I've finally come to understand that he's also extremely emotionally manipulative, and basically a narcissist. Any emotional vulnerability that I've ever let him see has been used against me. He regularly tries to start fights over nothing, and if I don't react (grey rock) he pulls out fights from literally decades ago that he wants to re-litigate.  He knows where my insecurities lie and uses them against me.

For my own emotional well being I've been pulling back from the marriage for years. I tell him nothing about what's in my heart or my head.  I had myself convinced that I had no sexual libido because the idea of being intimate with him again just made me dry up like the Sahara Desert, both figuratively and literally. We have had a totally dead bedroom for over five years, between his illness and my lack of interest.

And then... I met a man through my work (not someone I work with) and we started going out for coffee... and lunch... every week... for three or four hours.... and sometimes evening dates too... 

We just sit and talk and talk. He makes me laugh, and (OMG) he even listens to me. We have actual conversations, unlike the last ten years of my marriage. I feel seen for the first time in so many years. (Pro tip to any guys who are interested in getting with a woman - just friggin listen to her. Sometimes that's all it takes.)

He calls me his best friend, but there's such a spark there too.  I think of him constantly and I'm pretty sure that's mutual. We hug and touch hands and talk and talk. I am head over heels in love with this guy. He's not some kind of gorgeous hunk - he's a regular middle age man, balding, slightly overweight. But he's also sweet and goofy and I go all gushy inside when I see him.

And here's the part that really surprised me: I actually have a really strong libido when I think about him, which I do often. Let's just say we've gone from a desert to a rainforest in my vajayjay.... (sorry if that's TMI). 

But so far after several months it hasn't gone beyond this emotional affair. I really crave feeling his skin on mine, but he's also struggling with being in his own unhappy marriage. I'm not pushing things beyond some heavy flirtation because I sense that if I do I might ruin the friendship part of this. I think he knows that if he asks, the answer will always be yes.

I've read advice on this sub that all affairs have an expiration date, and I guess I'm also hoping that if we delay the physical part, and stay within the ""plausible deniability"" window of just being friends, we might put off that expiration date for a while. And honestly, the slow burn aspect of this has me all crazy too, in a delicious way.

So, I don't know if this really belongs on this sub, but I sure do understand a lot more about why people have affairs. It's not the black and white thinking that you see elsewhere on Reddit.

I've become a coffee neophyte in recent years after I started freelancing. I didn't realize the work and effort that goes into the production and distribution of coffee and have a newfound appreciation for coffee. I was the same with tequila and mezcal- I dint appreciate it as much until I learned about the history and production of the spirit. 

I live in Charlotte NC, but have been traveling around Mexico for a few months (Mexican background and I love my culture). Considering the growth Charlotte has seen in recent years and my love for coffee and Mexican culture, I figured why not open a Cafe? I have a background in architecture and web design, so most of the design service fees and marketing would be $0. 

I have an overall concept for the cafe and would love to work with someone to refine and adjust as needed. I started a pitch deck so that I can start to formalize ideas and thoughts , but hopefully in the end it will work as a true pitch deck when talking to investors or bank.

A little over a month ago, my boyfriend and I broke up because I was moving far away for medical school, and he made it clear he didn‚Äôt want to do long distance. It was incredibly painful, but we agreed to stay in touch since I‚Äôm on the waitlist for a school closer to him. I held on to the hope that maybe things would change if I got off the waitlist ‚Äî that maybe we‚Äôd have a chance if distance wasn‚Äôt in the way.

We stayed in contact after the breakup, and things were emotionally confusing. He invited me to his brother‚Äôs wedding ‚Äî I met his family, we danced, we held hands, we kissed. It felt like we were a couple again for one night, and it made things even harder. I realized we weren‚Äôt good at being ‚Äújust friends,‚Äù and that I needed space to move on.

I tried to schedule a coffee date before I left for a 3-week international trip, just to have some closure and end things on a more honest note. He agreed‚Ä¶ then canceled the night before. No explanation beyond a vague text that something came up. I took time off work for that conversation, and I was hurt ‚Äî especially because I had made it clear it was important to me.

I followed up with a message explaining how I felt ‚Äî how the last few weeks had been painful, how I didn‚Äôt want to stay friends, and how I needed space to move forward. I tried to be kind but direct. He hasn‚Äôt responded at all. It‚Äôs been days.

I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve been ghosted by someone I cared about this much, who brought me to his family‚Äôs wedding a few weeks ago. I don‚Äôt understand how you go from holding someone close to completely ignoring them. If he wanted the wedding to be the last time we ever saw each other why not just say that.

I saw her beautiful eyes in the brown of trees

Or within freshly made coffee 

I saw her hair in the dark of night

In nights where darkness wasn't something that struck fear in me

But instead comforted me quietly

Nights where I could close my eyes and faintly feel her fingers against my skin

Just enough to make me feel satisfied

I could hear her sweet, soft whispers in the wind 

In the gentle clashes of ocean waves against rocks

She was my Summer

My spring and Fall

She was my Winter

She was my everything

Yet I couldn't have her

The one time I wished to be selfish

For things to go my way

We were like the sun and moon

Unable to ever reach each other

Was this Karma?

You get what you give 

But what had I done to deserve this torture?

I was left a starved man in a desert

Grasping at straws

Whatever I could receive

Even if it wasn't real

Her relaxing touch becoming a mere figment of my imagination 

All I saw was her‚Ä¶

All I felt was her‚Ä¶

All I smelt was‚Ä¶

All I heard was her‚Ä¶

All I tasted was her

Even if it was just her name passing my lips

In quiet prayers said to no God in specific

We are thrilled to share with you the news that the Department of Computer Science and Department of Statistics are becoming the Sigma School of CS/DS (Cock Sciences-Dick Sucking (üò´).



Through a generous 10 billion peso joint gift from South American business magnate Jorge Soros and cocaine warlord Pablo Escobar, we are \*expanding\* (üò´)  the CS department into the newly \*erected\* (üò´) Sigma School of CS-DS within your mom. This new school (formerly the departments) will provide an even greater depth  (üò´) of resources. 



This milestone reflects the leadership, innovation, hard work and dedication of many people throughout our CS department, college, campus and beyond.



We are especially grateful to our donors for enabling us to \*engorge\* (üò´) our impact through \*expanded\* (üò´) cock sucking and research opportunities. (Also to Pablo Escobar but they mostly did it for the tax write off)



This is a moment in which the entire UBC kinkster community should all be filled (üò´) with pride. Together we are elevating opportunities to leverage the breadth and depth (üò´üò´üò´)  of excellence across our CS department to bolster our collective impact (in your mom‚Äôs bunghole; I ‚ù§Ô∏è UBC moms).



Many opportunities exist for collaboration in teaching and research encompassing Erotic Coffee Enema (ECE üò´) and Cock Sciences,‚ÄØalong with expertise across many other‚ÄØdepartments and disciplines, of which we hope you will take advantage (üò´).



Of note, there will be no departments within the new school. The names of degrees offered by the new school will be the same as those offered by the former Department of Computer Science. Computer Science Degrees will not change.  



We will officially begin using the new school name and logo (8=======D ur mom) following approval from the University of British Columbia Board of Trustees and the Ministry of Education later this year. In addition, we look forward to sharing more information about a celebratory orgy (üò´) this Fall.

That was ChronoSend for me. This little start-up, ""Temporal Solutions,"" claimed they'd cracked it ‚Äì sending emails to the past. Beta testers needed. I, being a technology reporter with a morbid curiosity, wangled my way in.

The interface looked like any old email client, just with a ""Target Date"" field. My wife, Sarah‚Ä¶ she died three years ago. Car crash. A drunk driver went through a red light at the junction of Oxford Road and Station Lane. 17th May, 8:03 pm. I still see it in my nightmares.

So, I typed:  
To:¬†mark.henderson@mailbox  
Target Date: 17th May, 2022, 7:00 pm

""Mark, this is you. Future you. Sounds insane, I know. But please, for the love of God, do NOT let Sarah drive tonight. Don't go out. Stay home. Avoid Oxford Road and Station Lane at all costs. Just trust me. Please.""

I hit send. My heart was a jackhammer. Nothing happened, obviously. Not in my present.

A week later, I'm making coffee, and Sarah walks into the kitchen.  
Sarah. Alive. Smiling. Complaining about the price of avocados.

I dropped the mug. She rushed over, ""Mark! Are you alright? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

""Sarah?"" My voice was a croak.

""Yeah, silly. Who else?"" She kissed my cheek. It felt like waking from a dream you never wanted to end. Her lips were warm, real. I could smell her shampoo‚Äîlavender and citrus. I just stared, afraid she'd vanish.

But she didn't.

The world felt‚Ä¶ off, though. My phone had a case I didn't remember. The coffee maker was different. A photo showed us at Niagara Falls‚Äîa trip we'd never taken, at least not in my memory.

Sarah was alive. That should have been enough. But the reporter in me couldn't let it go. I checked the news archives for 17th May, 2022, bracing myself for the headline about the fatal crash at Oxford Road and Station Lane. It was gone. In its place: ""Local Couple Win Pub Quiz Championship."" My heart thudded. What else had changed?

My inbox was full of emails about a promotion I didn't remember. My editor congratulated me on an expos√© I'd never written.

That night, I lay awake, watching Sarah breathe, feeling both gratitude and unease. I'd saved her, but at what cost? What else had changed?

The next morning, I found a new email in my Sent folder. It wasn't from me. Not exactly.

She ended up flinging herself off the sofa and hitting her head on our coffee table during playtime. There was no sharp edge because our coffee table is rounded, but it was still a pretty solid hit.

She cried profusely for about 3 minutes, and then nursed, ate a few bites of her snack, and fell asleep in my arms all within a 20 minute period.

I am not sure how to tell if a baby has a concussion. One one hand, she doesn‚Äôt tend to fall asleep so easily, but I also think she might be okay because she was willing to nurse and rarely ever takes any sort of medication so the small dosage of infant Tylenol could‚Äôve been kicking in.

It‚Äôs built to help you stay connected to the people in your life: old friends, professional contacts, anyone you don't see everyday but don't want to lose touch with over time. You can record important info like how you met or their spouse's name so you don't forget, set regular check-in reminders (monthly, quarterly, yearly, etc), and even get personalized conversation starters and news stories relevant to their interests so you always have something interesting to say.

InTouch is lightweight, private, and honestly something I built because¬†*I*¬†needed it. I'm absolutely TERRIBLE at professional networking (which is a big problem for an indie, who doesn't have a lot of infrastructure supporting him), and I also have a bad habit of forgetting to reach out to old friends I don't see very often anymore. A lot of treasured friendships and powerful connections have just faded away because I didn't remember, reach out, and reconnect.

InTouch is my shot at fixing that. It can be used for professional networking (e.g. reminding you to follow up with that guy you met at a conference, or reach out to your old coworkers), as well as for maintaining your personal relationships (e.g. touching base with old college friends, or making a point to send your in-laws a quick note every so often). If you‚Äôve ever found yourself thinking, ‚ÄúI should really reach out to them...‚Äù and then didn‚Äôt, that‚Äôs exactly what this app is for.

Social media promised us a world of greater connection, but a lot of people feel lonelier than ever. InTouch's mission is to reverse that trend, to foster deeper friendships and tighter bonds in the real, face-to-face world of human connection.¬†

InTouch is out on iOS and Android now at the links below. All the core features are free to use forever, along with some extra features you can unlock (since I do still need to buy food). I‚Äôd love for you all to check it out and let me know what you think!

I've become a coffee neophyte in recent years after I started freelancing. I didn't realize the work and effort that goes into the production and distribution of coffee and have a newfound appreciation for coffee. I was the same with tequila and mezcal- I dint appreciate it as much until I learned about the history and production of the spirit.

I live in Charlotte NC, but have been traveling around Mexico for a few months (Mexican background and I love my culture). Considering the growth Charlotte has seen in recent years and my love for coffee and Mexican culture, I figured why not open a Cafe? I have a background in architecture and web design, so most of the design service fees and marketing would be $0.

I have an overall concept for the cafe and would love to work with someone to refine and adjust as needed. I started a pitch deck so that I can start to formalize ideas and thoughts , but hopefully in the end it will work as a true pitch deck when talking to investors or bank.

If you are passionate about coffee and discussing ideas, please reach out and let me know if you'd be interested in connecting.

I‚Äôm new to this group and wanted to get some perspective on my experience with rhabdo. I was hospitalized in¬†early March 2024¬†after a pretty freak accident.  While I have worked out 6x a week since I was 24, (I'm now 40) my accident was ironically not fitness related ‚Äî  Puppy tripped me, I fell, hit my head on coffee table, and was unconscious for about¬†40 hours.  Ended up with¬†acute kidney failure,¬†drop foot,¬†nerve damage,¬†muscle breakdown, and a¬†severe concussion.

While I was in the hospital, the doctors mostly focused on my¬†kidney function (GFR)¬†and¬†creatinine¬†levels, which were dangerously low. Only recently, after joining this subreddit and seeing people post about¬†CK,¬†AST,¬†ALT, etc., did I realize how much more data there was on my labs.  And I have no idea when I see something like ""help, CK levels above 40,000K"" if that's a higher, lower, or the same as mine.  So I'd love to have this community help give me perspective on how my labs compare to some of your numbers?

**Was my rhabdo experience on the more severe end, or fairly typical for a hospitalized case?**

Here is what my labs said from first week.  I spent 4 weeks in ICU, then 2 months in rehab learning to walk again.  I'm (mostly ok) a year later.

* Creatine Kinase (CK):¬†60,178 u/L
* GFR (eGFR CKD-EPI):¬†1 mL/min/1.73m¬≤
* BUN:¬†148 mg/dL
* AST:¬†965 u/L
* ALT:¬†215 u/L
* Potassium:¬†6.5 mmol/L (Critical)
* Sodium:¬†131 mmol/L (Low)

I‚Äôd love to hear from others who‚Äôve been through this ‚Äî were your numbers similar? Higher? Lower? I‚Äôm just trying to wrap my head around where I landed on the spectrum of severity.

Thanks in advance for any input ‚Äî this community has already helped a lot.",1,1748121352.0,rhabdo_survivors,0,1.0,False

*Sam‚Äôs Point of View*  
\~2,600 words

The lab wasn‚Äôt much. It never had been.

It was a converted storage closet with no windows, a single whiny air vent, and a faint smell of overheated plastic that lingered no matter how many times he wiped the desk down. The light above the workbench flickered like it was trying to Morse-code its resignation. He‚Äôd meant to fix it months ago.

Still, Sam liked the space.

Not because it was pleasant ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äî but because it didn‚Äôt ask anything of him. It was too small to lose track of anything. Too quiet to pretend things were fine when they weren‚Äôt.

His desk had become a layered geography of parts and projects: multimeters, frayed wires, old diagnostics printouts, open code windows on a terminal that froze every third restart. And between a broken stylus and a tangle of charging cables sat a sealed chamomile tea bag ‚Äî unopened, slightly creased, folded into a napkin.

Christina had handed it to him a few weeks ago without much explanation.

*In case coffee stops working,*¬†she‚Äôd said, and walked off to the next customer.

He didn‚Äôt drink tea.

But he hadn‚Äôt thrown it away either.

She worked mornings at the caf√© across the street ‚Äî Loop. The kind of place with mismatched mugs, vaguely ironic playlists, and a menu that changed more often than the lightbulbs. Sam had no real opinion about any of that. But he knew she remembered his order. Always black. No room. No sugar. No conversation unless he started it.

She never pushed, never asked personal questions, never smiled unless she meant it.

She also had a habit of writing things on his cup sleeves. At first, it was harmless stuff ‚Äî weather jokes, caffeine puns. Later it turned into odd little phrases that sometimes felt like observations. Once, she wrote:¬†*You‚Äôre not a robot. Don‚Äôt work like one.*¬†He remembered that one.

He‚Äôd kept the sleeve, for reasons he didn‚Äôt explore.

And then one day, she wasn‚Äôt there.

The caf√© was open ‚Äî lights on, usual smell of scorched milk and almond syrup ‚Äî but someone else was working the counter. Young, upbeat, loud. Called him ‚Äúchief,‚Äù got his name wrong, added sugar even though he hadn‚Äôt asked.

It wasn‚Äôt a big deal.

Not really.

Still, something about it knocked the rhythm of the morning off by half a beat.

The second day, same thing.  
Third day, too.

He didn‚Äôt dwell on it. But he noticed.

That was all.

Back in the lab, the quiet was more noticeable. The machines still hummed. The debug script still hung on line 418. But the start of the day didn‚Äôt feel anchored the same way. Not broken ‚Äî just loose. Like a bolt that hadn‚Äôt failed yet but was beginning to shift under pressure.

The tea bag stayed on the desk. He glanced at it once, maybe twice. Thought about tossing it. Didn‚Äôt.

On the fourth morning, she was back.

He spotted her through the caf√© window before going in ‚Äî apron on, fixing the chalkboard with her usual tilt. She looked fine. Unbothered. Back like she‚Äôd never left.

He stepped inside, and she turned without missing a beat.

‚ÄúHey stranger,‚Äù she said, sliding behind the counter with the same calm focus she always had. No explanation. No apology. Just the drink, already in motion.

He didn‚Äôt say anything. Just watched her prep.

When she handed over the cup, their fingers brushed, and for a second, that same odd stillness settled between them ‚Äî not intimate, not awkward. Just... paused.

The sleeve had a note:  
*Still not a robot.*

He nodded. Not at the message. Just at her. Just to acknowledge the reset.

Then he left.

Back in the lab, he set the cup down beside the tea bag and got back to work.

He didn‚Äôt drink tea.

1kulpwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1kulpwy/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the caf√©s. Even the caf√©s can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a caf√©, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a caf√© wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their caf√© and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local caf√© can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

I've been talking to this guy and we just became official. But my mom has also been trying to set me up with this guy she works with (despite my protests). She told me he keeps asking about me and sent me his Instagram handle so I added him and sent him this message: ""Hey, I heard you keep asking about me but I'm actually already in a relationship. But if you ever wanted to hang out and grab a cup of coffee or something, I'm always looking for more gay friends!"" I told my boyfriend about it, and even suggested he come with, but he didn't seem to like the idea. He didn't make a big deal or anything, just got kind of quiet. So I'm wondering, was that maybe not the best idea? I'll have to talk more with him about it. If he really doesn't want me to, I won't go. But I also thought I might get an outsider's perspective.

Many politicians vanished from the public eye after the first burning.

Intelligence agencies had already delivered the truth:

This was no hoax ‚Äî it was law.

A law that no title, no faith, no rank could defy.

But there was one institution where fear arrived more slowly.

One that had hidden for centuries behind the veil of piety.

One that had mastered the art of lying better than anyone.

Religion.

And today...

The Vatican.

The day began like any other.

Robed clerics shuffled through the halls.

Candles were lit, floors swept, whispers of prayers dissolved into the cold stone.

Nuns bent in morning service beneath the shadows of marble columns.

Cardinals exchanged gossip, whispered intrigues ‚Äî who to pressure, which bishop to replace, where to ‚Äúexpand true faith.‚Äù

‚Äî We‚Äôve nearly secured the council in Quito, ‚Äî said one.

‚Äî Just need to approve the new coordinator, ‚Äî replied another.

‚Äî The main thing is to keep those bastards from the East out...

Their conversation was cut short when a man burst into the hall ‚Äî from the Segreteria di Stato, the Secretariat of State.

But he wasn‚Äôt just a messenger.

He was a harbinger of alarm ‚Äî the kind who only appears when something colossal is about to collapse.

He ran.

And on his face ‚Äî terror. Pure. Seared in. Unmistakable.

‚Äî Eminenze... ‚Äî he gasped. ‚Äî You‚Ä¶ you need to see this. Immediately.

The cardinals exchanged glances ‚Äî slowly, reluctantly.

But when he repeated:

‚Äî It‚Äôs above us.

‚Äî Over St. Peter‚Äôs Square‚Ä¶

‚Äî A being. It‚Äôs hanging in the sky.

‚Äî And it‚Äôs happening all over the world.

They rushed to the windows.

Then ‚Äî to the balconies.

And they saw it.

Above the grand plaza ‚Äî the place where pilgrims gathered, where the Pope spoke, where armies were blessed and children baptized ‚Äî

hung a figure.

A black suit.

No visible face.

The air around it was frozen.

Physics no longer applied.

Reality bent to him.

‚Äî What kind of devil‚Äôs trick is this? ‚Äî whispered one cardinal.

‚Äî Illusion? A hologram...?

‚Äî Heresy. A demon. Satan. Herod...

But none of them spoke further.

Because down below stood thousands of people.

All staring upward.

And then‚Ä¶

a voice.

Not from loudspeakers.

From within.

It spoke in every language.

The same sentence.

Cold. Calm. Without tone or emotion.

But to each listener ‚Äî it sounded familiar.

‚Äî First rule.

‚Äî Lies no longer exist.

A moment of silence.

And then‚Ä¶ panic.

One person ‚Äî burst into blue flames.

A scream.

A shriek.

Above them, words appeared in the air:

""Said he didn‚Äôt steal church donations. Lied.""

Another ‚Äî a few steps away.

Also ignited.

Floating above:

""Seduced a novice. Denied it.""

Cries.

The crowd tried to flee, but the flames didn‚Äôt spread like a plague.

They spread like questions.

One by one.

Slowly. Relentlessly.

The security aide, the one who had brought the cardinals, stood frozen.

Snapping out of his daze, he reached for his radio.

‚Äî We need to get them out! Now!

They fled deeper into the basilica.

Down corridors, through chambers, behind marble doors.

But ‚Äî fire on the right.

Fire on the left.

Blue tongues of flame.

Familiar faces.

The archivist. The abbot. The old bishop.

And above each ‚Äî a sentence.

""Lied about a prophecy. Served fear, not faith.""

Outside, the square had become a purgatory.

Those who lied ‚Äî burned.

Those who were silent ‚Äî wept.

Some fell to their knees, praying.

Others whispered in disbelief:

""This can‚Äôt be happening.""

""That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not God.""

But above them all ‚Äî

He hovered.

Silent.

Watching.

  
Chapter 9: Holy Hell (continued)

Scene I ‚Äî Rome



Rome.

Clear skies.

Above the basilica‚Äôs dome ‚Äî white clouds, like brushstrokes on a saint's icon.

Untouched by shadow.

But in St. Peter‚Äôs Square, it was already different.

Where usually whispers of prayer rose with the bells,

there were now screams.

Different ones.

Sharp. Hoarse. Silent.

The crowd broke apart.

Some ran in terror, stumbling, losing shoes, children, sanity.

Others dashed between souvenir stalls, looking for shelter beneath flimsy tents.

Some pressed against storefronts, as if glass could protect from the absolute.

But not everyone ran.

Some ‚Äî walked.

Slowly.

With wide pupils and lowered arms, muttering prayers.

They weren‚Äôt fleeing fear.

They were walking ‚Äî toward faith.

They dropped to their knees right there on the sunbaked stone.

Some in designer suits, clutching cameras.

Others barefoot, with dirty hands and tear-swollen eyes.

They looked upward.

To where It hovered.

They crossed themselves ‚Äî with desperation.

As if a gesture could rewrite the past.

They struck their chests.

They whispered:

""Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me...""

They prayed.

Hands folded, elbows on the ground, faces buried in stone.

But sadly‚Ä¶

This was not God.

This was something else.

Something that had rewritten reality.

It had not come to save.

It had come to expose.

It did not offer a choice.

It named the price ‚Äî for every lie, every ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù every ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù every ‚Äúwe never lie.‚Äù

It broke no laws.

It created new ones.

And with every moment, it became clearer:

To pray to it‚Ä¶

was to beg the executioner to bless the axe.

And still, they prayed.

Because it was easier.

Because no one knew what else to do.



Scene II ‚Äî Behind Closed Doors

Outside ‚Äî the crowd shattered.

Inside ‚Äî a heavy silence.

Deep within the Vatican, beneath carved arches and frescoed ceilings,

in an old crisis chamber known as Aula Silencio,

three men sat.

Three cardinals.

Three pillars.

The ones who always knew what to say.

But not today.

The door was locked behind them.

Swiss Guards stood outside.

Phones ‚Äî disconnected.

Screens ‚Äî glowing with live feeds from around the world.

‚ÄúAbove every capital,‚Äù whispered Archbishop Orlando Sepriani.

‚ÄúThe same figure.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe same phrase.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe same result.‚Äù

He was the oldest.

His hands didn‚Äôt tremble from age ‚Äî but from the unknown.

He had buried popes. Presided over conclaves.

He had passed judgments.

But now he sat like a student before an exam that could not be studied for.

‚ÄúThis... is impossible,‚Äù said Cardinal Luis Portelli,

a heavy man with a face carved from basalt.

He clutched his rosary, but no prayers would form.

The beads slipped through his fingers like sand.

‚ÄúEverything is possible,‚Äù said the third.

Raphael Marcelli ‚Äî young, charismatic, a man of cameras.

He wasn‚Äôt praying.

He was watching.

‚ÄúAnything is possible‚Ä¶ when fear is involved,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúAnd fear...‚Äù

He paused.

‚ÄúFear makes us vulnerable.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd it makes them ‚Äî controllable.‚Äù

He pointed at the screen.

There was the square.

People praying.

People burning.

Among them ‚Äî some still standing.

Staring.

Doing nothing.

‚ÄúThat is not God,‚Äù Portelli muttered.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a demon. A provocation. The antichrist.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho decides what God is?‚Äù Marcelli asked quietly, not turning his head.

‚ÄúYou? Or the one whose words become reality?‚Äù

Sepriani raised a hand ‚Äî cutting the tension.

‚ÄúQuiet.‚Äù

He gestured at a new broadcast.

Tokyo.

Live footage: rockets rising.

One. Then two. Then six.

Silence.

They watched.

Darkness turned into fire.

Flash.

Explosion.

The sky shook.

The cardinals froze.

‚ÄúIs he‚Ä¶ destroyed?‚Äù whispered Portelli.

No one answered.

The feed trembled.

Ash.

Flame.

No figure.

‚ÄúWhat now‚Ä¶?‚Äù murmured Marcelli.

‚ÄúMaybe‚Ä¶‚Äù

And then ‚Äî in the corner of the room

a fire ignited.

Blue.

No smoke.

No heat.

Silent.

A man caught fire.

It was a young assistant from the archives, who had stood quietly in the back.

He made coffee. Sorted schedules. Ran errands.

Now he stood ‚Äî ablaze.

Still.

Not screaming.

Above his head ‚Äî glowing words:

‚ÄúSaid he was in the archives.

In truth ‚Äî was hiding.‚Äù

The cardinals recoiled.

‚ÄúWho asked the question?‚Äù croaked Sepriani.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I did,‚Äù whispered Marcelli.

‚ÄúI just asked where he was while we were waiting.‚Äù

Silence.

And only the fire remained.",1,1748120360.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

How do I tell them this?,"I (M/31) have been talking to this person (W/36) from a dating app and we've been trying to schedule a date for about two weeks now. She's a mother of two, so naturally I understand there's a need to put them first; I am a pretty patient person with others about everything and patience has usually paid off. But this feels like it's grinding.

She made it clear that she wants people who show initiative in planning things. That in itself is fine, but I have had to do all the planning, suggesting, and logistics while she offers no input into anything whatsoever. Anytime I asked what she'd like to do, she basically says she wants me to pick it for us. suggested getting coffee and seeing a movie matinee three times, and it took until a week later to tell me she doesn't like drinking coffee. I asked her if she'd like to get ice cream and walk in the park, she said it's too hot. I asked for us to get sushi, she doesn't like sushi. I finally hit a place and we settled on Mexican. She then said I should pick the time, and when I suggested one, she said she wasn't free until this time in the day.

I am about at wits end. I truly don't resent being the one to take initiative at all. I want to court her and make her feel like I care! But feel like I can't read your mind before I even meet you about who you are and what I'm supposed to do, especially if you give me no insight into things that you actually like. Being unable to communicate isn't cute or something I'm supposed to deal with. Did I let this go too far, and should I tell them that I didn't appreciate the runaround of this?",1,1748120300.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

We‚Äôve been together 4 years and live together. We actually just got engaged recently.

We come from two different lives, so I know I can‚Äôt see things from his perspective- I grew up in an abusive household, very poor. He grew up rich, and now is very wealthy for his age from inheritance including a business he runs.

This has been an ongoing joke his friend say to me, that I‚Äôm the only one he likes or that nobody can look at me or he snaps.. which is sweet to an extent but the way he treats people sometimes makes me feel sad.

Like one thing that gets to me, is if a guy hits on me/asks for my number when he‚Äôs around he gets really unnecessarily aggressive. It just happened the other day a few of us were having coffee and we were sitting separately from the boys.
The man that hit on me was very kind and immediately took no for an answer.. if I ever needed him to get involved I would call for him and I didn‚Äôt, yet he walked over anyway and told him to f*ck off. I almost cried I felt so bad.

He also says things that make me sad, he always says he has ‚Äúdark humour‚Äù but the jokes to me are always sexism.. and then he says I‚Äôm too dramatic if I get mad.. this is probably the only thing that he does actually too me.

He‚Äôs also just a little ‚Äúsnobby‚Äù if that‚Äôs the right word. It‚Äôs just very clear he thinks he/we are above certain people. The less money you have the worse he‚Äôs going to treat you.
It makes me question a lot however,

It‚Äôs hard for me to be mad, or even think about splitting up because to me he‚Äôs genuinely sweet. when we met he knew I was poor. I was in student loan debt, cc debt and working as a waitress & a college dropout 
I‚Äôll never understand why I was an exception, but he liked me immediately and before we even dated he helped me out a ton.

Over the years together he has done everything for me, he‚Äôs never gotten mad or yelled at me once. He has supported me through therapy. He includes me in his lifestyle without ever making me feel like I owe him if that makes sense.. which was one of my worries when we met because I knew I couldn‚Äôt afford to keep up with him. Since we started dating he has never let me pay for a thing, but has never held it against me. 

He actually recently has really been pushing me to quit my job, because he thinks after all these years of struggling I should just spend time working on my mental health and just focus on home stuff like cooking/cleaning.. he said not having a schedule or boss or any worries would make a big difference for me.

He‚Äôs just always very considerate and wants the best for me. on the other hand I want to talk to him more about how he treats people, but I know he doesn‚Äôt see it the same so it‚Äôs tough.

1kullkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1kullkx/five_stars_no_survivors/,"Five stars, no survivors .","It started with a ping.

I was parked outside a 7-Eleven off Route 43, sipping cold coffee and waiting for a ride request. The icon popped up: ‚ÄúPick up: Clayton Ridge ‚Äì 1.2 miles.‚Äù No profile photo. No rating. Just a blank, gray avatar.

Weird, but not unheard of.

I tapped ‚ÄúAccept‚Äù and drove. The road narrowed, houses fell away, and soon I was idling in front of a dense patch of woods. That‚Äôs when I saw him‚Äîtall, wiry, wearing an old leather butcher‚Äôs apron stained a deep, flaking maroon. He climbed in, dragging a duffel bag that clinked like steel and bones.

‚ÄúWhere to?‚Äù I asked.

He didn‚Äôt speak. Just entered an address on my app. Seventy miles away.

As I drove, he hummed tunelessly, and I swore I heard something move in the bag. I cracked the window. He didn‚Äôt seem to notice‚Äîor care.

I dropped him off at a boarded-up farmhouse around 2 AM. As he got out, he turned to me and spoke for the first time.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre reliable,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be hearing from others.‚Äù

I laughed it off, drove home, told myself it was just some weirdo with a fetish for bad vibes.

But then came another ping.

No photo. No rating. Pick-up: Elmwood Cemetery. 3:33 AM.

I should‚Äôve declined. Should‚Äôve thrown my phone out the window and gone to sleep. But I didn‚Äôt.

The next one was a woman. Pale as wax, blood on her cheek, dragging a suitcase that left a red smear along my backseat. She smelled like bleach and old iron.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt ask questions, right?‚Äù she asked, eyes darting like a rabbit‚Äôs.

‚ÄúNope,‚Äù I muttered.

‚ÄúGood. Drive.‚Äù

That was the night I became a rideshare driver for serial killers.

They called themselves ‚ÄúThe Flock.‚Äù Or at least, that‚Äôs what one of them whispered through cracked lips, chewing on a toothpick made from a finger bone. They weren‚Äôt a cult. Not exactly. Just... connected. A network. They found each other online. Dark web, maybe. Or something older.

My app stopped behaving like it used to. No updates. No ads. Just job after job, ping after ping, every pickup more unsettling than the last.

One guy wore a pig mask and kept laughing like a child. Another woman carried a taxidermied fox that she talked to like it was her son. Once, I dropped a man off at a lake just before dawn‚Äîhe walked in wearing bricks on his feet, waving goodbye without ever turning around.

They tipped well. In cash. Crisp bills that smelled like copper and ash.

Eventually, I tried uninstalling the app. My screen went black. When it came back, it was already routing me to my next pickup.

That‚Äôs when I realized‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt driving them. I was part of it. The car was mine, but the road belonged to them. Every mile I drove, I was sinking deeper into something I couldn‚Äôt escape.

One night, I broke.

I picked up a kid. Barely sixteen. Sweaty, wide-eyed, hands trembling. He smelled like gasoline. He said nothing, just handed me an envelope. Inside: a Polaroid of a man tied to a chair, mouth sewn shut. And an address.

‚ÄúDrop this at the warehouse,‚Äù the kid said. ‚ÄúThen burn it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing this anymore,‚Äù I snapped.

He looked at me like I‚Äôd just said gravity wasn‚Äôt real. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get to quit. You think you‚Äôre just the driver? You‚Äôre the thread. Without you, the Flock unravels.‚Äù

I kicked him out. Drove straight home. Parked the car. Deleted the app. Changed phones. Changed cars. Moved cities.

It didn‚Äôt matter.

The new car locked itself one night while I was driving. The dashboard lit up with a familiar ping.

Pick-up: 666 Ashmere Lane.

I hadn‚Äôt given that address. I hadn‚Äôt even opened the new phone.

And still‚Äîit found me.

The worst part? I started to recognize them. Not just the killers. The victims. People who smiled at me in coffee shops. A barista who made my drink. A teacher from the elementary school. Once, I picked up a woman who‚Äôd been laughing with her friends five minutes earlier‚Äîand dropped her off in pieces behind a meatpacking plant.

Last week, I drove a man with no eyes. His sockets dripped saltwater, and the air around him buzzed like radio static. He said he was looking for ‚Äúthe Shepherd.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll know,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúWhen he gets in your backseat and asks if you‚Äôre ready for the final ride.‚Äù

Tonight, my phone pinged again.

Only this time, the pickup address was my house.

I stared out the window, heart hammering.

There he stood‚Äîlean, tall, eyes like empty tunnels. Wearing a black driver's cap. In his hand was an old, rusted key.

He smiled and pointed to my car.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your turn.‚Äù



I backed away from the window.

The man outside didn‚Äôt knock. He didn‚Äôt need to. My phone buzzed with a new notification: ‚ÄúPassenger waiting. ETA: Now. FINAL RIDE.‚Äù The screen pulsed with red light.

I grabbed my keys‚Äîbut they weren‚Äôt there. The rusted key in his hand? That was mine now.

A low hum began to build, not outside, but in my head. Like a distant choir of insects screaming in unison. My car door creaked open by itself, though I hadn‚Äôt unlocked it. The dome light glowed a sickly green.

I should have run. I wanted to run.

But my legs moved on their own.

I climbed into the driver‚Äôs seat like a sleepwalker. The man slid into the back, silent as a grave. He was no longer smiling. His face was blank. Not neutral‚Äîabsent. Like a mask someone forgot to animate.

The engine turned over, though I never touched the ignition.

‚ÄúDrive,‚Äù he whispered.

‚ÄúTo where?‚Äù I asked, but my voice sounded far away, like it was coming from underwater.

He didn‚Äôt respond, but the GPS lit up on its own:
‚ÄúFinal Destination: 0 miles. Arriving Now.‚Äù

The road warped. The streetlights bent backward. Time slowed.

We weren‚Äôt driving anymore. We were descending.

My surroundings peeled away like old wallpaper‚Äîsuburbia giving way to black fields stitched with bone. A moonless sky loomed above, breathing. Yes, breathing. With every exhale, the air got colder. The clouds formed screaming faces that watched the car pass like mourners at a funeral no one was invited to.

Then came the pit.

It wasn‚Äôt a location. It was a hole in reality. A chasm where the GPS screamed ‚ÄúRECALCULATING‚Äù over and over until it burst into static.

The car hovered on the edge.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve earned this,‚Äù the man in the back said. ‚ÄúYour seat in the Flock is reserved.‚Äù

He held out a mirror.

It wasn‚Äôt my reflection I saw‚Äîit was all the rides. Every victim. Every killer. Every bag of meat dragged into the woods. I saw myself watching it all, dead-eyed, complicit. A passenger in my own life.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt kill them,‚Äù I muttered.

‚ÄúYou drove the blade.‚Äù

My hands started to decay. Skin blackening. Nails peeling. Every mile I‚Äôd driven‚Äîevery act of silence‚Äîwas catching up.

But then‚Äîsomething cracked.

It wasn‚Äôt the world. It was me.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. Not a whisper this time. A roar. ‚ÄúYou want a driver? Drive yourself.‚Äù

I jerked the wheel hard and flung the car into reverse. Tires screeched. Flames licked the edges of the pit as the nose of the car lifted away from it.

The Shepherd screamed‚Äîhis voice not human, but thousands layered atop one another, like a graveyard shrieking.

I didn‚Äôt look back.

The road reformed beneath us, but not neatly. It was wild, chaotic‚Äîpaved with shattered bones and shattered choices. I sped through it anyway, the speedometer spinning wildly.

The Shepherd clawed at the backseat, trying to reach me. His hands burst into worms. His mouth split into three, all of them chanting something in reverse.

But the mirror he held?

I grabbed it.

Slammed it into the dashboard.

It shattered‚Äîand with it, so did he.

The backseat erupted in black smoke. A thousand shadows fled into the night, moaning like condemned souls.

The car swerved, hit something‚Äîthen silence.

When I woke up, I was in a cornfield. No road. No Shepherd. Just stalks and silence.

The app was gone from my phone. Completely. Not deleted‚Äîerased. Like it had never existed.

I limped home. My car was totaled. The windows had claw marks. The backseat reeked of sulfur.

But I was free.

It took months to sleep again. The news reported a drop in missing persons cases in my area. One detective theorized a trafficker had been killed. They didn‚Äôt find any suspects. Or bodies.

But I knew.

One night, I got a letter in my mailbox. No stamp. Just a torn piece of newspaper folded inside. On it, a review:

‚ÄúFive Stars. Smooth ride. Good music. Shame he broke the rules. But even the Flock sheds dead feathers.‚Äù

I moved. Again. Burned everything from that part of my life. Took a job at a mechanic shop. No phones. No apps.

But sometimes‚Äîlate at night‚ÄîI still hear that ping.

And once, in my rearview mirror, I saw a man in a leather apron standing at the edge of a field.

He didn‚Äôt wave.

He just watched.

Still, I smile. Because I made a choice. I turned around. I shattered the mirror. I looked evil in the face‚Äîand reversed.

They might still be out there. The Flock. The Shepherd. Waiting for a new driver.

But it won‚Äôt be me.

Not anymore.

Not ever again.

Were in our early to mid 20s (she's younger only by a year) Shes very smart and bright when it comes to planning things and paperwork, and just knows her way around through an argument to come out on top( I like it when she does it to others, but not when we have arguments lol)

Main story: Were planing a trip somewhere cold in south America, as we‚Äôre finally beginning to pack there's a jacket that I grab, that I enjoy wearing when the climate is cool. I've had it for about 4 years, it's almost my staple jacket for winter time its a banana republic jacket, it isn't the warmest but it definitely can be layered. Anyways, she began to say that I'm not taking that, and hung it back up‚Ä¶ we repeated this 4+ times. Then she raised her voice trying to snatch the jacket of my hands repeating you're not taking it, ‚Äúits not a warm jacket‚Äù ‚Äúthen you'll have to leave your shoes behind‚Äù (I'm taking 4 shoes for different events and activities she's referring to some casual brown shoes).

While this is happening I'm thinking ‚ÄúI'm paying for this entire trip for me to not take what I want to take?‚Äù ‚ÄúShes over reacting‚Äù ‚Äúshe's acting childish‚Äù I think I'm a fairly patient person, I just held on to my jacket in a calm tone repeating ‚ÄúI'm taking it, I like it, I want to take it‚Äù eventually she walks away grabs some clothes she was planing to take, hangs it back up and tells me she's not going on the trip, and says you can take someone else. That upsets me a little, so I just go off to the kitchen to make me a coffee.

Am I an ass for thinking she should back off a bit? I'm letting her plan the trip, take what she wants, plan what she wants, basically plan all my other outfits and I can't take 1 jacket? I honestly think she's getting over her self. Have I given her too much governance that she forgot who's paying. Idk‚Ä¶

1kulj7p,https://i.redd.it/925hz0azls2f1.jpeg,My Kayali Collection,"All the Kayali collection posts lately have inspired me to also share my collection along with my thoughts about each fragrance. With the recent sales and full-size Vacay in a Bottle releases, my collection is growing fast. I know Kayali gets a lot of flack for being an influencer brand and for their marketing tactics that are known to generate FOMO. I definitely get why people have their reservations, but the brand has me in a chokehold and I kind of love it here. Kayali is honestly my favorite fragrance house and I own more of their fragrances than any other house. If I'm a basic trendy bitch who loves sweet scents then so be it. Below are my opinions of the fragrances in my current collection. I would love to hear your about Kayali likes and dislikes, opinions, and anything else ü•∞

**Vanilla | 28** üßÅü•É - my favorite. The one that started it all. Smells like a deep boozy vanilla extract to my nose. My bottle has finally macerated and seems to have greater longevity on my skin now, which is great. It's so good to me that I just bought a backup, which is a first for me for any fragrance. I love layering it with SDJ '62 and Wish You Were Here by Memoire Archives, which has notes of coffee, toasted almonds, and petrichor. This combo is my comfort scent! V28 is definitely more of a cold weather fragrance for me due to the booziness. 

**Yum Boujee Marshmallow | 81**üçìüç∞ - this one is my second favorite. Great for any time of the year, although I feel like it really shines during spring and summer. A lovely, fluffy marshmallow that to me smells straight up like a strawberry milkshake. I wish this one had a bit more longevity on me. I'm hoping that it will be similar to V28 in longevity once it macerates for a bit. I got my bottle in February, so I think it might need a bit more time. To bring out more of the strawberry, I'll often layer it with NEST Santa Barbara Strawberry. This combo has gotten me several compliments and really gives it a lush fruity vibe.

**Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar | 42** üç≠üßÅ- this one lasts a long time on me and has a bubblegum opening that rounds out into a nice creamy spun-sugary vanilla. Great for any time of year. I just got a full bottle from the Huda sale last week. To me, it's kind of in the same family as Cloud Pink by Ari on that it has those cotton candy vibes about it. This one is my next biggest compliment getter. I love layering it with the Cottom Candy Clouds body lotion from Bath and Body Works!

**The Wedding Silk Santal | 36** ü•ÇüéÇ - I was expecting more prominence of floral notes in this fragrance, which is what initially put me off from trying it since I am really particular about florals. I happened to test it in Sephora one day and was pleasantly surprised. I don't really pick up on the florals and it seems more airy and light gourmand to my nose. I think of this fragrance as the lighter sister to VCRS because to me, it smells like VCRS without the bubblegum in the opening. This one has pretty good longevity on me and is definitely worth the hype! I wish I could have gotten this in a 100ml.

**Utopia Vanilla Coco | 21** üå¥ü•• - jasmine is one of the few floral notes that I like, and I feel like the jasmine note in this one really makes it stand out and gives this fragrance an air of elegance that I don't get from other coconut scents. Makes me think of laying on a hammock under a cabana at a luxurious beach resort and while sipping on a pi≈àa colada. I definitely want to get a full size of this at some point. I have this in the mini and in the purse spray, and what's interesting is that I smell the jasmine more in the mini, but in the purse spray I notice the coconut more. I think maybe maceration is the difference once again, since I've had the mini for longer and have used it more often than the purse spray.

**Marrakesh in a Bottle Orange Blossom | 24**üçäüåπ- my favorite from the Vacay in a Bottle collection. This one also lasts a really long time on me, and to my nose, it smells like a delicious spicy mix of orange candy (pez maybe?) and rose. Rose is not a note that I normally go for, but it works really well in this fragrance and makes it a big more complex. I think this one is the most polarizing of the Vacay collection, but it's easily my favorite! I think it's a good match for my personality (spicy, energetic, exotic). Definitely makes me imagine distant locales that I would love to visit one day.

**Capri in a Bottle Lemon Sugar | 14** üçãü´ì - my second favorite from the Vacay in a Bottle collection. I have to agree with those who say that this one smells like pure lemon sugar or lemon pez. I have this one along with D&G Devotion and this one is the sweeter of the two for me. Both are unique and smell amazing, but Devotion has this citronella note on me at the beginning which can be a little much sometimes. This one unfortunately doesn't last very long on me though, but I still love it so much that I want a full size! 

**Maui in a Bottle Sweet Banana | 37**üçåüåä - this one took me by surprise, because I don't really care for bananas--eaten, smelled, or otherwise. I think its the coconut cream and jasmine notes that work so well with the banana. This scent instantly transports me to a tropical island and makes me crave a blue Hawiian mixed drink. I plan on getting this in a full size. This one has pretty good longevity on me. Not as good as Marrakesh, but a whole lot better than Capri!

**Maldives in a Bottle Ylang Coco | 20** üèùüßâ - this one started out kinda meh for me, because I dont really care for aquatic scents, and that's what I get from this one. However, it's been growing on me lately and it's a nice fresh change from my usual sweet lineup. I fee like this is a nice, elegant vacation scent. I'm considering a full bottle, just because I think it will be nice to have something different like this in my collection for those hot summer days when I need a cool drench of aquatic goodness. Maldives is also one of my dream vacation destinations, so this scent just always has me daydreaming about the day I finally get to visit!

**Vanilla Royale Sugared Patchouli | 64** ü•Éü•Æ - this one is heavy on the patchouli. It's a bit too mature for me because of that, but I have to give it credit. It lasts FOREVER on me. Like, this one has the most staying power of all of my Kayalis üòÇüò≠ I just wish I liked it more. I will say that if I can power through the strong patchouli opening, the patchouli does eventually fade away and it basically ends up smelling exactly like Vanilla 28 in the dry down. This one is definitely a cold weather scent in my opinion because of the heaviness that the patchouli gives.

**Yum Pistachio Gelato | 33** üç¶üå∞ - I have mixed feelings about this one. I definitely have smelled the soapy green notes that everyone talks about. I got this one a couple of years ago in the purse spray and only have a couple of spritzes left. I tested it again the other day because it has been a while, and I feel like maceration definitely helped it become more gourmand and less soapy. Despite that, it still just doesn't grab me in the same way that a lot of the others do. I really wanted to like this one, but its still just kinda meh for me overall. 

Other Kayalis I want to try/add to my collection:

**Oudgasm Collection** - I'm really intrigued by this collection, as I've never smelled oud before and have a feeling that I'm going to enjoy it. I plan on getting the mini collection next time there's a good sale. If anyone has any input on these, I would love to hear it!

**Eden Sparkling Lychee | 39** and **Eden Juicy Apple | 01** - I've smelled both of these in Sephora and thought they both smelled fruity and delicious. Eden Juicy Apple is the perfect luscious apple scent. I dont usually care for apple scented or apple flavored anything, but this one is really nice. Eden Sparkling Lychee is a nice lighter fruity scent that smells almost peachy to my nose. I'm looking forward to getting minis of both of these!

**The Wedding Velvet Santal | 35** - I've never smelled this one before, but I love earthy woody scents, especially cedarwood. I'm really looking forward to trying this one and I'm hoping that it will be a little less sweet than the rest of the lineup, even though the sweet scents are what I typically gravitate to. It's just nice to have some variety sometimes!

I would also really love to smell some of the older releases, like Citrus | 08, Elixir | 11, Musk | 12, Invite Only Amber | 23, Sweet Diamond Pink Pepper | 25, and Deja Vu White Flower | 57. I've never seen testers for these, and many of them are out of stock on the Huda website. Hopefully one day I'll get to try them!

I also am hoping that Kitten Musk will be a  real release, even though it was just an April Fool's joke. Based on their marketing, it really wouldn't surprise me if they released it for real this fall! 

Anyway, that's it! I hope you guys enjoyed reading my reviews. This was the first time I had ever felt compelled to do anything like this, and it was fun. I usually just lurk in the comments section, but maybe I'll do another write-up sometime. NEST is my second favorite house after Kayali, so I could definitely see myself writing about their fragrances as well ü•∞",26,1748119914.0,FemFragLab,6,0.96,False

I have been depressed on some level since i was a child and sought treatment as a teenager. I continued playing the pick a medication game the doctors gave me for about 2 years and after being a nauseous zombie all that time i stopped. I was still depressed, but now felt physically ill AND so foggy i could barely function ( my mom actually told doc she was done watching me suffer more). Now i am 40. I have been the only person i could rely on for as long as i can remember and pretty much always end up giving more than i get any all relationships. I can barely make it through a grocery store without feeling completely overwhelmed by people. I tried to do remote therapy in 2021 and of the weekly therapy appointments i had scheduled over the course of 3 months, my therapist showed up to 3, she canceled on me last minute all the other times. I gave up. I feel like i have to beg to get basic care even from doctors. My MD told me i probably just drink too much Coffee...

1kulflg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1kulflg/hello_the_void/,"Hello, the void","I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm typing this. If you‚Äôre here, you‚Äôre probably unsure about a lot of things too. 

On April Fools Day (of course) my wife (42f) left while I (40m) was at work. Packed her things, half the furniture, wall decorations, pets, all of it, and then turned off her phone. It was a week before I finally got through to her. She was in the hospital for a physical/mental breakdown. Some context:

For years she had health problems (reproductive) and I did my best to take care of her, not pressure her about intimacy, take care of the pets, and really tried to still be romantic, get her flowers, cookies, heating pad, left cute notes by the coffee maker w/ her coffee each morning, etc. But still, after her eventual hysterectomy, our intimacy and affection ground down to nothing.

She said it wasn‚Äôt fair of her to deny me affection, she just wasn‚Äôt there anymore. I also had my son every weekend, who is mentally challenged/became a different person with puberty and seizure meds, and I know it was all too much. I know why she left, I know she needed her own life, but still‚Ä¶

When she left, she didn‚Äôt just take my best friend, but also my babies (our pets) and all of her family right along with her. I loved her mom, dad, brothers, aunts/uncles, nieces and nephews‚Ä¶I always drove 7 hours to see them, and I loved holidays, because I was distant from my own family after my parents moved to different states.

I‚Äôm honestly shattered. People say I‚Äôll meet someone new, but I don‚Äôt think I want to. I already found my soulmate. We didn‚Äôt need to be intimate, I would have gladly gone on medication to kill my sex drive rather than get a divorce. I never cheated, never wanted to, and outright told her I just wanted her to be happy and financially comfortable, finally, after years of working toward that. 

My son was about to turn 18, we both made enough money to pay our debts, and now we‚Äôre both going to struggle, albeit she has much more financial safety net with her family being well-off.

I just can‚Äôt stand the silence of an empty house, without the cats, the dog, the laughter, the meals. I‚Äôve lost 30+ pounds in 2 months, and I can‚Äôt sleep. I tried contacting past friends, but they‚Äôre all busy with their spouses, kids, families, houses, and tight friend circles - the very same things I was so wrapped up in for years too, but now I‚Äôm alone. I tried fixing up my house and yard, to paint over the puppy teeth marks on doors, and pee stains on the lawn, but I‚Äôm just exhausted, and everything is falling apart. Soon my home oil tank will run dry, my car will sputter out, the furnace will stop working, and I‚Äôll probably lose my job because I‚Äôm losing all my muscle (I print t-shirts for a living, but it requires loads of food I can no longer afford on my own with all the bills and rent.)

Sorry for rambling, I just have no friends. I‚Äôm trying to appreciate having a house, a car, a son, and this living body I keep dragging around, but I really needed her. I needed the pets, our family. I wish I could make this lighter or brighter or less defeatist. I don‚Äôt want anyone else. I had everything I wanted. Without them, I feel like a ghost.

Oh, lastly, she apparently didn‚Äôt look into divorce laws before leaving, because she moved to another state and can‚Äôt file for divorce until she‚Äôs been a resident for 6 months, so she‚Äôs asked me to serve *her* the divorce papers. We have no kids or property together, so it‚Äôs just a formality. I‚Äôll do it to make her happy, but I feel like it might be the very last thing I do, just to give her the life she wants.

My establishment is almost two years old. From get go we had a pay before service system. Clover system like pretty much anyone. Only difference we did is two screens instead of flip to leave a tip option (more expensive to me but saves the embarrassment for people behind the counter and guests(that was my idea))
Restaurant is set up in a way that you order, pay and then everything is brought out to you. If you want anything extra you get back to the counter or staff can take an order at the table. Basically full service, but you pay up front. In my opinion that reduces the pressure to leave as soon as you are done eating (the usual- would you like dessert? No? Here‚Äôs a check! Bye!) we want people to stay and enjoy. 
I expected that my staff will not get any tips (Iam from Europe where 10% is an awesome tip) so we started everyone on a pretty good starting wage. Here‚Äôs the interesting part. My staff has no way to know who tipped what. Because they don‚Äôt have access to this information. Tips are pooled. They just know the total at the end of shift. And they average around 18%. Here‚Äôs the benefit I see as an owner of the restaurant  - everyone gets equal service. No matter they tip or not.

After some time spent using it daily, I feel confident sharing my experience. While there‚Äôs plenty to like about this faucet water filter, there are also some things that deserve closer scrutiny. Let me walk you through the finer details of this system.

**Easy On-the-Faucet Setup**  
Installing this filter is an absolute breeze. It doesn‚Äôt require a toolbox or even a shred of technical expertise‚Äîeverything you need comes in the box. The system securely attaches to most faucets with visible, external aerators, but as I discovered when helping a friend try to set it up on their pull-out faucet, compatibility can be an issue with certain designs. Still, for standard faucets, the straightforward twist-on process takes less than five minutes. The on/off toggle lever is a bonus, allowing you to switch between filtered and unfiltered water effortlessly.

**Performance That Shines Through**  
Daily use of this faucet mount filter reveals why PUR has been a leading name in water filtration for decades. With its 3-in-1 filtration system, it‚Äôs officially certified by both WQA and NSF to reduce over 70 contaminants, including lead and microplastics. Having small children at home, knowing the water they drink is free of those harmful impurities gave me serious peace of mind. The taste difference is also impressive‚Äîmy coffee and tea genuinely taste better. However, I did notice the water flow rate slows down slightly when filtering.

**Highlights**  
- Certified to filter out over 70 contaminants, including lead and microplastics.  
- Easy to install and switch between filtered and unfiltered water.  
- Filter light indicator ensures timely replacements.   

**Filter Maintenence and Cost Considerations**  
Integrated into the design is a helpful change light that signals when the filter has reached its 100-gallon or roughly three-month lifespan. I liked that I didn‚Äôt have to guess about when the filter needed replacing, but the cost of purchasing new filters can add up over the year, especially if you‚Äôve got a large household. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that only genuine PUR filters are compatible with this system, which might feel restrictive for anyone looking for alternatives.

**Design Aesthetics and Material Quality**  
The metallic grey version of the faucet mount filter struck me as both sleek and modern. It doesn‚Äôt stick out awkwardly in the kitchen and actually blends in with stainless steel sinks pretty seamlessly. That being said, the material used‚Äîplastic‚Äîis lightweight and functional but doesn‚Äôt convey a particularly premium feel. After some weeks of use, I worry about scratches appearing on the exterior.

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Sleek, compact design that doesn‚Äôt feel intrusive.  
- Clear and user-friendly filter replacement indicator.  
- Supports proper hydration with water that tastes noticeably better.  

**Pitfalls**  
- Not compatible with non-standard faucets like pull-out designs.  
- Flow rate slows down when filtration is active.  
- Plastic material can feel less durable over time.  

**Market Rivals Worth Considering**  
Comparing this product to other water filtration systems, such as Brita‚Äôs faucet filter or ZeroWater‚Äôs pitcher, highlights some interesting distinctions. The PUR PLUS filter excels in its certification to filter out more contaminants than Brita‚Äôs systems, including microplastics, which Brita doesn‚Äôt specifically cover. ZeroWater, while excellent for its thorough filtration, doesn‚Äôt offer the convenience of an on-demand faucet setup. That makes the PUR filter the more convenient option for anyone seeking instant results with minimal hassle. However, Brita‚Äôs filter replacement cartridges often come at a slightly lower cost, which might be a deciding factor for budget-conscious buyers.

**Affordable Quality**  
From a financial standpoint, the initial cost of the faucet mount system is moderate, especially if you consider how much you‚Äôll save compared to regularly buying bottled water. The potential savings of up to $30 weekly really add up, particularly if you‚Äôre someone like me who previously relied on bottled water for day-to-day hydration. However, the recurring expense of replacement filters does have to be planned for. In the long run, though, I‚Äôd say it falls on the more cost-effective end of the scale when compared to other filtration methods, as you‚Äôre getting well-filtered tap water without the recurring need to purchase gallons of bottled water.

Today, I‚Äôm writing this detailed MITOLYN review not just as a satisfied customer‚Äîbut as someone who finally feels in control of their life and health again.

# üîç What is MITOLYN?

Before diving into my personal experience, let me give you a quick overview of what MITOLYN actually is.

**MITOLYN** is a powerful, science-backed dietary supplement designed to support **mitochondrial health**, energy production, cognitive function, and overall wellness. It‚Äôs packed with premium ingredients that help your body at the **cellular level**‚Äîsomething most supplements totally ignore.

I learned that as we age, our mitochondria (the energy factories inside our cells) start to deteriorate. This leads to fatigue, brain fog, slower metabolism, and even early signs of aging.

**MITOLYN is designed to reverse that process.**

# üí¨ Why I Tried MITOLYN

I stumbled upon MITOLYN while searching for a real solution to my daily fatigue. I‚Äôm a busy working parent, juggling deadlines, meetings, and family life. No matter how much I slept or what I ate, I always felt **worn out by 2 PM**.

After trying other so-called ""natural"" supplements with zero results, I decided to give MITOLYN a shot‚Äîmainly because of the **raving customer reviews** and the fact that it‚Äôs based on **mitochondrial science**.

# üîÑ My Experience Using MITOLYN

I took MITOLYN exactly as directed‚Äî**2 capsules daily with water in the morning**. Within **a few days**, I started noticing a difference.

# ‚úÖ Week 1:

* I didn‚Äôt feel the usual mid-day crash.
* I had more energy throughout the day.
* My sleep felt deeper and more refreshing.

# ‚úÖ Week 2:

* My focus at work improved.
* I wasn‚Äôt reaching for coffee 3 times a day anymore.
* I felt **lighter, more positive, and in control.**

# ‚úÖ Week 4:

By the end of the month, I was **functioning at a level I hadn‚Äôt experienced in years**. My mood stabilized, my energy levels were consistent, and I actually wanted to exercise again.

It felt like my body had hit a reset button.

# üî¨ What Makes MITOLYN Different?

What truly sets MITOLYN apart from other supplements is its **formulation**. This isn‚Äôt a random blend of herbs‚Äîit‚Äôs a carefully crafted formula supported by science.

Here are just a few **powerful ingredients** I found listed:

* **CoQ10** ‚Äì Essential for mitochondrial energy and heart health
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine** ‚Äì Boosts brain function and cellular energy
* **PQQ** ‚Äì Helps generate new mitochondria
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** ‚Äì A potent antioxidant
* **Magnesium & B Vitamins** ‚Äì For stress management and nervous system support

These are all **clinically proven ingredients** that actually support long-term health‚Äînot just mask symptoms.

# üòç Real Benefits I Noticed

|Mood & Stress|Less irritability, more patience|
|Sleep Quality|Deeper, more restful sleep|
|Physical Wellness|More motivation to move and stay active|
|Overall Wellbeing|I felt ""younger"" inside and out|

# üõ°Ô∏è Is MITOLYN Safe?

As someone who‚Äôs always cautious about what I put in my body, safety was a top concern for me. Thankfully, **MITOLYN is made in an FDA-registered, GMP-certified facility** in the USA. It‚Äôs **non-GMO, gluten-free, and contains no artificial fillers**.

I‚Äôve had **zero side effects**, and I feel confident knowing that what I‚Äôm taking is backed by both science and quality manufacturing.

At first, I thought it was just another gimmick‚Ä¶ until I saw someone turn a static photo of their dog mid-jump into a full-on slow-mo video. The fur, the motion, the physics‚Äîit looked insanely real. Now I‚Äôm low-key obsessed. 



Imagine with this function: 

\- That awkward group photo where someone blinked? The AI can generate a smooth video of everyone smiling naturally.

\- Vacation pics of waterfalls/clouds? Turn them into cinematic loops for your Instagram Stories.

\- Taking a still selfie and having the AI animate your hair blowing in the wind? Or make your coffee steam rise realistically?

Also the meme potential is endless ‚Äî turn a screenshot of your friend‚Äôs ""üòê"" face into them dramatically rolling their eyes.

It‚Äôs like the phone predicts how things should move in real life. No more 100 takes for the perfect action shot ‚Äî just let the AI work its magic afterward. And the demos I‚Äôve seen have crazy detail retention, even in low-light shots.



I‚Äôm seriously tempted to grab the 400 Pro just for this feature. But here‚Äôs my question: Is the AI as intuitive as it looks?  And what would you animate first?

Today, I‚Äôm writing this detailed MITOLYN review not just as a satisfied customer‚Äîbut as someone who finally feels in control of their life and health again.

# üîç What is MITOLYN?

Before diving into my personal experience, let me give you a quick overview of what MITOLYN actually is.

**MITOLYN** is a powerful, science-backed dietary supplement designed to support **mitochondrial health**, energy production, cognitive function, and overall wellness. It‚Äôs packed with premium ingredients that help your body at the **cellular level**‚Äîsomething most supplements totally ignore.

I learned that as we age, our mitochondria (the energy factories inside our cells) start to deteriorate. This leads to fatigue, brain fog, slower metabolism, and even early signs of aging.

**MITOLYN is designed to reverse that process.**

# üí¨ Why I Tried MITOLYN

I stumbled upon MITOLYN while searching for a real solution to my daily fatigue. I‚Äôm a busy working parent, juggling deadlines, meetings, and family life. No matter how much I slept or what I ate, I always felt **worn out by 2 PM**.

After trying other so-called ""natural"" supplements with zero results, I decided to give MITOLYN a shot‚Äîmainly because of the **raving customer reviews** and the fact that it‚Äôs based on **mitochondrial science**.

# üîÑ My Experience Using MITOLYN

I took MITOLYN exactly as directed‚Äî**2 capsules daily with water in the morning**. Within **a few days**, I started noticing a difference.

# ‚úÖ Week 1:

* I didn‚Äôt feel the usual mid-day crash.
* I had more energy throughout the day.
* My sleep felt deeper and more refreshing.

# ‚úÖ Week 2:

* My focus at work improved.
* I wasn‚Äôt reaching for coffee 3 times a day anymore.
* I felt **lighter, more positive, and in control.**

# ‚úÖ Week 4:

By the end of the month, I was **functioning at a level I hadn‚Äôt experienced in years**. My mood stabilized, my energy levels were consistent, and I actually wanted to exercise again.

It felt like my body had hit a reset button.

# üî¨ What Makes MITOLYN Different?

What truly sets MITOLYN apart from other supplements is its **formulation**. This isn‚Äôt a random blend of herbs‚Äîit‚Äôs a carefully crafted formula supported by science.

Here are just a few **powerful ingredients** I found listed:

* **CoQ10** ‚Äì Essential for mitochondrial energy and heart health
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine** ‚Äì Boosts brain function and cellular energy
* **PQQ** ‚Äì Helps generate new mitochondria
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** ‚Äì A potent antioxidant
* **Magnesium & B Vitamins** ‚Äì For stress management and nervous system support

These are all **clinically proven ingredients** that actually support long-term health‚Äînot just mask symptoms.

|Physical Wellness|More motivation to move and stay active|
|Overall Wellbeing|I felt ""younger"" inside and out|

# üõ°Ô∏è Is MITOLYN Safe?

As someone who‚Äôs always cautious about what I put in my body, safety was a top concern for me. Thankfully, **MITOLYN is made in an FDA-registered, GMP-certified facility** in the USA. It‚Äôs **non-GMO, gluten-free, and contains no artificial fillers**.

I‚Äôve had **zero side effects**, and I feel confident knowing that what I‚Äôm taking is backed by both science and quality manufacturing.

Today, I‚Äôm writing this detailed MITOLYN review not just as a satisfied customer‚Äîbut as someone who finally feels in control of their life and health again.

# üîç What is MITOLYN?

Before diving into my personal experience, let me give you a quick overview of what MITOLYN actually is.

**MITOLYN** is a powerful, science-backed dietary supplement designed to support **mitochondrial health**, energy production, cognitive function, and overall wellness. It‚Äôs packed with premium ingredients that help your body at the **cellular level**‚Äîsomething most supplements totally ignore.

I learned that as we age, our mitochondria (the energy factories inside our cells) start to deteriorate. This leads to fatigue, brain fog, slower metabolism, and even early signs of aging.

**MITOLYN is designed to reverse that process.**

# üí¨ Why I Tried MITOLYN

I stumbled upon MITOLYN while searching for a real solution to my daily fatigue. I‚Äôm a busy working parent, juggling deadlines, meetings, and family life. No matter how much I slept or what I ate, I always felt **worn out by 2 PM**.

After trying other so-called ""natural"" supplements with zero results, I decided to give MITOLYN a shot‚Äîmainly because of the **raving customer reviews** and the fact that it‚Äôs based on **mitochondrial science**.

# üîÑ My Experience Using MITOLYN

I took MITOLYN exactly as directed‚Äî**2 capsules daily with water in the morning**. Within **a few days**, I started noticing a difference.

# ‚úÖ Week 1:

* I didn‚Äôt feel the usual mid-day crash.
* I had more energy throughout the day.
* My sleep felt deeper and more refreshing.

# ‚úÖ Week 2:

* My focus at work improved.
* I wasn‚Äôt reaching for coffee 3 times a day anymore.
* I felt **lighter, more positive, and in control.**

# ‚úÖ Week 4:

By the end of the month, I was **functioning at a level I hadn‚Äôt experienced in years**. My mood stabilized, my energy levels were consistent, and I actually wanted to exercise again.

It felt like my body had hit a reset button.

My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I‚Äôd be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn‚Äôt go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

[**‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**](https://603dep05g7pb5z6kxbn-k2-6f4.hop.clickbank.net)

Doctors told me it was ‚Äújust IBS‚Äù or ‚Äústress-related.‚Äù I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting‚Äîyou name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.

I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: ‚ÄúWhat do I have to lose?‚Äù

The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.

By day 3, I noticed something shocking‚Äîmy stomach wasn‚Äôt making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I‚Äôm talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating‚Äîjust relief.

Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What‚Äôs Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn‚Äôt crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved‚ÄîI felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.

Oh, and here‚Äôs something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected‚Äîand PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.

Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn‚Äôt in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.

Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat‚Äîwithout changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn‚Äôt holding on to toxic waste anymore.

Let me be clear: this isn‚Äôt some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.

Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here‚Äôs what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:

‚úÖ Spore-Based Probiotics ‚Äì These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.

‚úÖ Clinically Proven Strains ‚Äì These aren‚Äôt just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.

‚úÖ No Refrigeration Needed ‚Äì PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it‚Äôs easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!

‚úÖ Third-Party Tested ‚Äì You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.

‚úÖ Real, Lasting Results ‚Äì Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.

Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:

Bloating or gas

Irregular bowel movements

Leaky gut or food intolerances

Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings

Skin issues like acne or rashes

Weakened immunity

Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...

Then this product is 100% for you.

Even if you ‚Äúfeel fine,‚Äù the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins‚Äîwe ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.

Final Verdict: I‚Äôll Never Go Without It Again

I‚Äôm now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I‚Äôll never go without it again. I‚Äôve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation‚Äîshe‚Äôs now a die-hard fan too.

Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don‚Äôt work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you‚Äôre even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You‚Äôll know within a week or two that something is changing‚Äîand you‚Äôll never want to go back.

I don‚Äôt say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn‚Äôt just help me poop better‚Äîit gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

Similarly, Alexa from Wyoming mentioned, ‚ÄúI used to need so much Botox to keep the wrinkles away that my face was permanently frozen.

Similarly, Alexa from Wyoming mentioned, ‚ÄúI used to need so much Botox to keep the wrinkles away that my face was permanently frozen. And it did nothing for the saggy skin on my chin and my turkey neck. A few weeks into using this PrimeBiome supplement and I am speechless! I wake up, I look in the mirror and I love what I see. No more expensive procedures and thousands of needles in my face for me. It‚Äôs simply unbelievable!‚Äù",1,1748118314.0,LegalAdviceEU,2,1.0,False

# üîç What Is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is not your average multivitamin or caffeine-loaded pill. It‚Äôs a¬†mitochondrial support supplement‚Äîdesigned to rejuvenate your cells, boost energy production, and restore biological balance at the¬†deepest cellular level.

In a world where everyone seems to be running low on energy, it's tough to find a supplement that actually works without relying on heavy stimulants.

That's why when I heard about Mitolyn, a mitochondrial support supplement, I was intrigued ‚Äî but also skeptical. Lots of products promise the world and deliver little.

After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I‚Äôm honestly impressed.

This isn‚Äôt just another energy pill ‚Äî it‚Äôs something different, and in this review, I‚Äôll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it‚Äôs worth considering.

What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body‚Äôs ability to create real energy at the cellular level.

That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves ‚Äî from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.

What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what‚Äôs inside:

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.

PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).

N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.

Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.

Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.

Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.

In other words, Mitolyn isn‚Äôt throwing random ingredients together ‚Äî it‚Äôs built around a clear, science-backed strategy.

My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.

Week 1-2:

At first, I didn‚Äôt feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.

Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""

Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn‚Äôt been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.

The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I‚Äôm no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.

Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.

Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.

Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.

Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger ‚Äî more vibrant and ""alive.""

Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:

Clean, research-based ingredient list

No stimulants, no crash

Noticeable improvements after consistent use

Supports both mind and body

Manufactured with high quality standards

Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens

Cons:

Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)

Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements

Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)

Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:

Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep

Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness

Want better exercise performance and recovery

Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally

Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements

However, if you‚Äôre just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn‚Äôt for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.

Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely ‚Äî especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.

I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I‚Äôm fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.

Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.

Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.

Immediately I'm not everyone's cup of tea. I am a recent college grad. I live an alternative lifestyle! I enjoy building cars, computers, and miniatures. I enjoy cozy nights in or going out to try new things. Recently I've been i to tabletop gaming and always learning a new skill. Additionally, I attend anime and furry conventions when I have the chance (see you at Stratofur 2025). Lastly, I love listening to metal and rock. Im located in Texas, USA.

About me physically: I am around 5'11 and of native American and white descent. I have super broad shoulders and workout casually. Brown hair and hazel eyes for the win. Also, I have two tattoos. I hope to have a sleeve in the future

Now about you: Do you see yourself on bookstore and coffee dates? Are you comfortable snuggling at home after a rough day at work? Im looking for something long term with someone genuine. Let's get to learn about what we love in life and explore our passions. We shall divulge in a slow burn, a fulfilling life, and raise a great family. If you're into dark romance books, also know you won't be disappointed ü´∂üíô

If you made it this far, I already appreciate you. I hope I'm the one for you! While I am an acquired taste of a partner, I wish to be yours.

1kukvkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1kukvkb/does_gain_liquid_laundry_detergent_moonlight/,Does Gain Liquid Laundry Detergent Moonlight Breeze Deliver on Its Promises Review?,"Testing out the Gain 10037000807022 Laundry Detergent, titled Gain + Aroma Boost Moonlight Breeze scent, has been a daily pleasure for someone like me who takes laundry seriously. This liquid laundry detergent not only excels at cleaning even the most stubborn stains but also leaves such an unforgettable scent that I find myself sniffing my clothes like a weirdo. It‚Äôs perfect for a hardworking household, though there are certainly some aspects worth considering. 

**Scent That Stays Forever (Or Feels Like It Does)**  
The Moonlight Breeze scent is, hands down, one of the biggest highlights of this product. My laundry room smells like a meadow on a crisp spring evening every time I do a load. Clothes come out smelling fresh and vibrant, and the freshness genuinely lasts up to six weeks from wash to wear. For someone who often forgets to put laundry away immediately, this is a game-changer. I tested this claim on my gym clothes, and yes, even after weeks in the drawer, they still smelled heavenly.  

**Ease of Use and Convenience**  
Using this liquid detergent is as simple as pouring a cup, and honestly, one cap really does go a long way. Gain wasn‚Äôt bluffing when they claimed that one cap‚Äôs freshness and cleaning power rival an entire bottle of leading baking soda detergent. The liquid flows smoothly, and the measuring cap eliminates half the guesswork. It‚Äôs compatible with all washing machines, including HE models, which is nice for folks upgrading their appliances. Whether you prefer cold water washes or run loads at high heat, it adapts well and maintains its effectiveness.  

[Check Gain 10037000807022 price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b09nym2k1p/)  

**Performance for the Busy Lifestyle**  
As someone perpetually on the go, I need my detergent to deliver spotless results without having to rewash. Between my outdoor camping trips and my kids‚Äô dirt-covered uniforms (thank you, soccer season), the superior cleaning power of this detergent took me by surprise. Tough stains like grass, mud, and even coffee were no match. It‚Äôs like watching a small miracle every time I pull out perfectly cleaned clothes. Laundry suddenly feels slightly less like a chore.  

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Long-lasting scent that lingers for weeks.  
- Effective on tough stains like coffee, mud, and grass.  
- Works smoothly in cold water, making it energy-efficient.  
- Compatible with all types of washing machines, including high-efficiency (HE) models.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The packaging could use an upgrade; I had a slight spill the first time I opened it.  
- A clearer list of eco-friendly certifications would be nice, especially for us environmentally conscious folks.  

**Design and Portability**  
While the sleek bottle design fits perfectly on a laundry shelf, its 130-ounce size can make it feel a bit bulky, especially for those working in tight spaces. Pouring a large quantity of liquid detergent requires some care to avoid spills. I imagine people with smaller hands might find it slightly inconvenient to handle. Still, the flip-top cap is a thoughtful touch that reduces mess overall.  

**Competitive Options**  
Having tried other liquid detergents like Tide Original and Arm & Hammer Clean Burst, I‚Äôve noticed distinct differences. Gain nails the fragrance while still delivering powerful cleaning, while products like Tide prioritize stain removal and may feel less ‚Äúfresh‚Äù in the long run. Arm & Hammer often markets affordability but lacks the multi-week freshness Gain provides. Where Gain slightly lags is in environmentally conscious marketing compared to brands like Seventh Generation. Gain outshines these rivals in versatility, though, especially with its compatibility with all types of machines and cold water efficiency.  

**True Value**  
The balance between long-lasting scent, stain-cleaning prowess, and its eco-adaptability justifies its cost. Gain delivers a significantly high price-to-quality ratio. Even though its cost might verge on the higher end sometimes, knowing that one bottle could replace multiple subpar alternatives makes it worth every cent. A bottle this size is particularly good for large families or heavy laundry users, as each load costs only a fraction of what more expensive niche detergents might.

A YOUNG TOURIST approaches with her family.

YOUNG TOURIST
Excuse me, officer? Can you tell us where the House votes on bills?

FRANK
House chamber's on the secand ond floor, but if you're hoping to see and democracy in action today, you might be disappointed. Most of the real work happens in back rooms and over dinner.

The tourist looks confused. Frank softens.

FRANK (CONT'D)
But the gallery's still worth seeing. Just follow the signs.

As the family walks away, OFFICER MARTINEZ (35) approaches.

MARTINEZ
Cynical today, Sarge?

FRANK
Realistic. You been here long enough, you'll understand.

MARTINEZ
Maybe. Or maybe I'll keep believing in the process.

Frank gives him a look that says 'we'll see.'

INT. GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - ER - 8:00 AM

DR. MARIA VASand QUEZ (35) examines an elderly homeland ess man, WALTER (70s). She's professional but warm.

MARIA
Walter, your blood pressure is through the roof. When's the last time you took your medication?

WALTER
Can't afford it, Doc. Social Security don't stretch that far.

MARIA
(frustrated but not at Walter)
I'm going to get you a prescription assistance form. And Walter? There's a vote in Congress today about expanding Medicare coverage for prescriptions.

WALTER
Politicians don't care about people like me.

MARIA
Some do. The trick is figuring out which ones.

**ACT ONE**

INT. GSA FEDERAL BUILDING - MAINTENANCE OFFICE - 9:00 AM

TOMMY SULLIVAN (45) sits in a cramped office with other MAINTENANCE WORKERS, including his friend RAY (40s). Tommy's reading from a tablet while eating a breakfast sandwich.

TOMMY
Says here the infrastructure biThe guy'scludes $50 billion for fedThe guy'sbuilding upgrades. Green energy retrofits, improved ventilation systems.

RAY
More work for us?

TOMMY
If it passes. That's a big if. Also means job securifor ty for the next five years.for 

RAY
Since when do you read policy papers, Tommy?

TOMMY
Since my daughter started college and told me I should know what my government's actually doing. Kid's got a point.

The other workesand  laugh, but not unkindyand .

TOMMY (CONT'D)
Besides, we're the ones who'll have to install all this green technology. Might as well understand what we're dealing with.

INT. D.C. PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - 9:30 AM

ELENA RODRIGUEZ (38) sits across from a frustrated TEACHER, MS. COOPER (30s).

MS. COOPER
Elena, I have thirty-four kids in my AP History class. Thirty-four. How am I supposed to give them individual attention?

ELENA
The budget's tigdoisa. You know that.

MdoOPER
But there's all this talk about federal education funding. What aboI hopenfrastructure bill? DIshope have mogiver schools?

ELENA
Some. Bugiveas to pass first. And even then, it'll take months to filter the down to us.

MS. COOPER
Meanthe while, my kids suffer.

ELENA
Your kids are lucky to have you. We'll figure something out. We always do.

But Elena's expression shows she's not sure they will.

EXT. FOOD TRUCK - NEAR CAPITOL BUILDING - 11:00 AM

MIKE KODo youSKI (42) serves lunch Do youa line of federal workers from his truck ""Mike's Mobile Kitchen."" He's efficient and friendly, knowing many customers by name.

MIKE
(to regular customer)
The usual, Dave? Turkey and swiss?

DAVE (CUSTOMER)
You got it, Mike. Hey, you hear about this infrastructure bill? Supposed to help small businesses.

MIKE
(skeptical)
Government help usually comes with strings attached. More regulations, more paperwork.

DAVE
This one's different. Tax credits for small businesses that go green.

MIKE
(wiping down counter)
I'll believe it when I see it. Washington's great at promia ses, not so great at foa llow-through.

A CONGRESSIONAL STAFFER in line behind Dave rolls her eyes,.

CONGRESSIONAL STAFF,ER
Some of us are actually trying to help, you know.

MIKE
No offense, ma'am. Just seen a lot of politicians come and go.

CONGRESSIONAL STAFFER
Fair enough. But maybe give us a chance?

Mike hands her a sandwich with a slight smile.

MIKE
Hope springs eternal, right?

INT. D.C. CHILD SERVICES - JANET'S OFFICE - 2:00 PM

JANET WILLIAMS (45) revithe ews case files whethe n her phone rings. She looks exhausted but answers with professional warmth.

JANET
Janet Williams, Child Services.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING - SARAH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

SARAH
Janet, it'sand  Sarah Chen. Iand  know we haven't talked since college, but I need your help.

JANET
(surprised)
Sarah? Congressional Sarah? What can I do for you?

SARAH
The infrastructure bill has funding for family services. Congressman Walsh wants to know the real impact on families. Can you give me specifics?

JANET
(pause)
You want the truth or the political answer?

SARAH
Always the truth with you. That's what I remember.

JANET
The truth is I have 47 active cases and should have 30. Half these kids need services we can't provide because we don't have funding. Your bill passes? Maybe I can actually help some of them.

SARAH
That's what I needed tdo o hear. Jando et? We should catch up som?time.

JAN?T
I'd like that. Just remember us when you're making policy, okay?

SARAH
That's why I called.

**ACT TWO**

INT. MURPHY'S TAVERN - 5:30 PM

The bar is starting to fill with the after-work crowd. MURPHY O'CONNOR (60s) wipes down glasses behind the bar. He has the easy manner of someone who's heard every story.

Sarah enters, looking drained. She takes a seat at the bar.

MURPHY
Rough day in the democracy business?

SARAH
Is it that obvious?

MURPHY
Twenty-seven years working for Congress before I bought this place. I recognize the look.

Sarah manages a weak smile.

SARAH
Scotch. Neat.

MURPHY
(pouring)
Infrastructure vote today?

SARAH
How'd you guess?

MURPHY
Been watching C-SPAN. Old habits.

Frank enters in civilian clothes, taking a seat two stools down.

FRANK
Murphy. The usual.

MURPHY
(pouring a beer)
Frank, meet Sarah. Sarah, Frank keeps the Capitol safe.

SARAH
Thank you for what you do.

FRANK
Just doing my job. Though some days I wonder if any of it matters.

SARAH
(defensive)
Of course it matters.

FRANK
Does it? I've been protecting politicians for twenty-five years. Seen a lot of big votes, lot of important bills. Things seem pretty much the same to me.

SARAH
Change takes time.

FRANK
Easy to say when you're not the one waiting for it.

The conversation could turn tense, but Murphy intervenes smoothly.

MURPHY
Frank, you remember when they renovated the visitors' center? Took forever, went over budget, everyone complained?

FRANK
Yeah.

MURPHY
But now millions of people get to visit their Capitol every year safely and comfortably. Sometimes change is invisible until you step back and look.

Tommy enters, still in his work uniform.

TOMMY
Murphy, beer and a shot. It's been a day.

MURPHY
Tommy Sullivan, meet Sarah and Frank. Tommy keeps the federal buildings running.

TOMMY
(to Sarah)
You work on the Hill?

SARAH
Chief of staff for Congressman Rivera.

TOMMY
The infrastructure guy? My crew's been talking about that bill all day.

SARAH
(interested)
Really? What are they saying?

TOMMY
That it's about time somebody rememberdand  the poand ple who actually maintain this country's buildings. Green retrofits sound good on paper, but w; youthe; you and who'and ll have to figure out how to make them work.

FRANK
Government's good at big ideas. Implementation's another story.

TOMMY
(to Frank)
You sound like my ex-wife. Always looking for problems.

FRANK
I sound like someone who's seen this movie before.

SARAH
But what if this time is different?

Maria enters, looking exhausted from her shift.

MARIA
Murphy, whatever's strongest.

MURPHY
Dr. Vasquez, tough day in the ER?

MARIA
(sitting near the group)
Saw three people today who couldn't athe the fford their medications. All preventable conditions if they had proper healthcare access.

SARAH
There's healthcare provisions in the infrastructure bill.

MARIA
(skeptical)
Politicians have been promising healthcare reform my entire career.

SARAH
I'm not all politicians. And this isn't just reform, it's investment in people.

FRANK
With respect, ma'am, that's what they all say.

Sarah's frustration is building, but she tries to stay diplomatic.

SARAH
Look, I understand cynicism. But if you don't believe change is possible, why even try?

TOMMY
Maybe because some of us don't have a choice. I can't just give up and buy a bar.

He looks at Murphy apologetically.

TOMMY (CONT'D)
No offense, Murphy.

MURPHY
None taken. But I didn't give up. I just changed how I serve.

Elena enters, looking frazzled.

ELENA
Sorry I'm late, Murphy. School board meeting ran long.

MURPHY
Elena Rodriguez, meet some new friends. Elena runs one of the best high schools in D.C.

ELENA
(to the group)
You all work in government?

SARAH
In various ways.

ELENA
Then maybe you can tell me why my kids have to choose between music class and college prep because we can't afford both.

SARAH
The infrastructure bill has education funding.

ELENA
How much and when? Because I have to cut two teaching positions next month.

Sarah doesn't have a good answer. The group falls into an uncomfortable silence.

FRANK
See what I mean? Big promises, real problems.

TOMMY
(to Sarah)
Look, we're not trying to give you a hard time. It's just... we've heard this before.

MARIA
Every election cycle, someone promises to fix healthcare, education, infrastructure. Then they get to Washington and nothing changes.

SARAH
(passionate now)
But things do change! Maybe not as fast as we want, but they do. Social Security, Medicare, the Civil Rights Act - none of that happened overnight.

ELENA
Those were different times.

SARAH
Were they? People said the same things then. That politicians couldn't be trusted, that the system was broken.

MURPHY
(quietly)
She's got a point.

FRANK
Murphy?

MURPHY
I worked on the Hill during the Clinton years, the Bush years, Obama, Trump. Every administration thought they were going to change everything. Some changes stuck, some didn't. But the country's still here.

TOMMY
Barely.

MURPHY
Come on, Tommy. You really think things are the same as they were fifty years ago?

TOMMY
(considering)
I guess not.

SARAH
All I'm asking is for a chance. This bill isn't perfect, but it's a start.

Maria's phone buzzes. She checks it.

MARIA
The vote's happening now.

Murphy reaches for the remote and turns on the TV behind the bar. C-SPAN shows the House floor.

**ACT THREE**

INT. MURPHY'S TAVERN - CONTINUOUS

The group watches the TV as the House vote unfolds. The tension is palpable.

TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
The vote on H.R. 2847, the Infrastructure Investment Act, continues. We're seeing a very close count.

SARAH
(checking her phone)
We're at 217. Need one more.

FRANK
Walsh from Ohio?

SARAH
(surprised)
How did you know?

FRANK
Talked to his security detail. Guy's been going back and forth all day.

ON TV: The voting clock shows 3 minutes remaining.

TOMMY
What happens if it fails?

SARAH
We start over. Maybe next year.

ELENA
My kids can't wait next year.

MARIA
Neither can my patients.

Sarah's phone rings. She steps away to answer.

SARAH
(into phone)
What? Are you sure? 
(pause)
Walsh voted yes? 
(bigger pause)
It passed? It actually passed?

She hangs up, turns to the group with tears in her eyes.

SARAH (CONT'D)
Two hundred and eighteen to two-ten. It passed.

The group is quiet for a moment, processing.

TOMMY
Now what?

SARAH
Now it goes to the Senate.

FRANK
(dryly)
Oh good. The easy part's over.

Despite himself, he's almost smiling. The group laughs.

MURPHY
This calls for a toast.

He pours drinks for everyone.

MURPHY (CONT'D)
To small victories and long journeys.

They raise their glasses.

SARAH
To doing the work, even when it's hard.

TOMMY
To the people who actually have to make it all work.

MARIA
To hoping things can get better.

ELENA
To not giving up on each other.

FRANK
(reluctantly)
To... democracy, I guess. Messy as it is.

MURPHY
To common ground.

They drink. For a moment, despite their differences, they're united.

SARAH
(to the group)
You know what? Walsh's office said he decided to vote yes after hearing from constituents about real-world impact. Stories like yours.

TOMMY
You mean our complaining actually helped?

SARAH
Your truth helped. There's a difference.

Mike enters, having just closed his food truck.

MIKE
What's everyone celebrating?

MURPHY
Democracy, Mike. Pull up a chair.

As Mike joins the group, the camera pulls back to show Murphy's Tavern - a small island of common humanity in the middle of a divided city.

SARAH (V.O.)
They say politics is the art of the possible. But maybe it's really the art of listening. Of finding the places where our different stories connect.

**ACT FOUR**

INT. MURPHY'S TAVERN - ONE HOUR LATER

The group has settled into more relaxed conversation. Janet enters, looking tired but relieved to be off work.

JANET
Sorry I'm late. Had to finish some case files.

MURPHY
Janet Williams, meet your fellow public servants.

As introductions are made, we see the beginnings of real relationships forming.

ELENA
(to Janet)
Child services? I probably have some of your kids at my school.

JANET
Wouldn't surprise me. We should coordinate better.

SARAH
That's exactly the kind of collaboration government should facilitate.

FRANK
Government facilitating collaboration. Now there's a novel concept.

TOMMY
(to Sarah)
So what happens next with the bill? Really?

SARAH
Honestly? Months of committee hearings, amendments, political horse-trading. The Senate will want changes.

MARIA
How long?

SARAH
If we're lucky? Six months. Maybe more.

ELENA
My kids can't wait six months.

SARAH
(pause)
What if they didn't have to?

JANET
What do you mean?

SARAH
I mean, what if we didn't wait for Washington? What if we started fixing things ourselves?

TOMMY
Like how?

SARAH
(warming to the idea)
Tommy, your crew knows federal buildings better than anyone. Elena, your school needs resources. What if we connected you with federal agencies that could help?

FRANK
Unofficially?

SARAH
Within the rules, but creatively. Maria, you know which patients need help. Janet, you know which families need services. What if we created a network?

MURPHY
Sounds like community organizing.

SARAH
It is. It's also good government.

MIKE
(joining the conversation)
What about small businesses?

SARAH
Federal contracting preferences for local businesses serving federal workers. Like your food truck.

MIKE
(interested despite himself)
You think that could work?

TOMMY
Won't matter if nobody talks to each other.

SARAH
That's why we're here, isn't it? To talk to each other?

Murphy wipes down the bar, listening to the conversation with a small smile.

MURPHY
You know, when I worked on the Hill, the best solutions came from conversations like this. Real people talking about real problems.

FRANK
Think it could actually work?

MURPHY
Only one way to find out.

ELENA
So we meet here regularly? Compare notes, share resources?

JANET
I'd be up for that.

MARIA
Me too.

TOMMY
What do we call ourselves? The Murphy's Tavern Society for Fixing Everything?

Laughter.

SARAH
How about we just call ourselves neighbors?

FRANK
Neighbors who happen to work in government.

SARAH
Neighbors who happen to care about making things work.

Murphy raises his glass again.

MURPHY
To neighbors.

They toast again, but this time it feels different. More personal. More real.

SARAH
(checking her watch)
I should get home. Long day tomorrow.

ELENA
More votes?

SARAH
Committee markup on education funding. Elena, maybe you could testify?

ELENA
(surprised)
Me?

SARAH
Who better to talk about what schools need than someone who runs one?

ELENA
I... yes. I'd like that.

As people start to leave, exchanging contact information and making plans, Murphy turns to the camera.

MURPHY
(to audience)
Funny thing about democracy. It's not really about the buildings or the votes or the speeches. It's about moments like this. People talking to people. Finding common ground.

The last few patrons settle their tabs and head out into the D.C. night.

MURPHY (CONT'D)
See, the thing about common ground is you can't mandate it from above. You have to find it together, one conversation at a time.

He turns off the TV, dims the lights.

MURPHY (CONT'D)
Same time tomorrow, I guess. That's how democracy works. You show up, you listen, you try to find a way forward together.

He locks up the bar and walks into the night, the Capitol dome visible in the distance.

FADE TO BLACK.

END OF EPISODE

## **Production Notes**

**Episode Length:** Approximately 45 minutes
**Location Requirements:** Murphy's Tavern (main set), various government buildings, hospital ER, school
**Guest Stars:** Congressman Walsh (via phone), various government workers and constituents
**Tone:** Balanced between cynicism and hope, grounded in real political process
**Themes:** The gap between policy and implementation, the importance of listening, finding common ground through shared civic responsibility

**Episode Arc:** Establishes the core group, their different perspectives on government, and the beginning of their informal network. The infrastructure bill vote provides stakes and urgency while allowing each character to reveal their relationship to power and policy.

**Character Development:** Each character's introduction establishes their worldview and role in D.C.'s ecosystem. The episode ends with the possibility of collaboration rather than just complaint - setting up the series' ongoing tension between idealism and realism.

**Political Balance:** The episode presents legitimate concerns from multiple perspectives without taking partisan sides. The focus is on process and people rather than ideology.",0,1748118022.0,writers,1,0.5,False

1kukrjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIContentAutomators/comments/1kukrjb/i_automated_an_entire_digital_product_business/,I Automated an Entire Digital Product Business Using AI Tools - Full Process Revealed,"**Ever thought about running a business from your couch in your PJs while sipping coffee?** ‚òïÔ∏è Well, guess what? I did just that by automating an entire digital product business using AI tools! And let me tell you, it‚Äôs a game changer! üöÄ

Okay, here‚Äôs the scoop. I‚Äôve always believed in the idea of working smarter, not harder. I mean, who really wants to slave away day and night when you can have a digital assistant doing the heavy lifting for you? *Right?* 

**So, how did I pull this off? Let me break it down for you:** 

1. **Finding My Niche:**  
   First things first‚ÄîI had to pick something I was passionate about. For me, it was e-books on personal development. ü§ì It‚Äôs something I love, and I knew there‚Äôs a market for it. 

2. **AI Research Tools:**  
   I dived into AI research tools like **ChatGPT** and **Jasper** (I know, these names sound like they could be friends). They help generate content and brainstorm ideas quicker than I can say ‚Äúwriter‚Äôs block.‚Äù Plus, they don‚Äôt complain when I ask them ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the meaning of life?‚Äù multiple times. üòÇ

3. **Automated Content Creation:**  
   Okay, so here‚Äôs where the magic happens. I set up templates in these tools for e-book outlines, blog posts, and social media content. It‚Äôs incredible how much *time* it saved me. Imagine typing just a few keywords, and voil√†‚Äîyou have a full page of content. 

4. **Marketing Automation:**  
   I used platforms like **Mailchimp** and **Buffer** to automate my email campaigns and social media posts. It‚Äôs like having a personal marketing exec who doesn‚Äôt take lunch breaks. And who doesn‚Äôt love reaching out to thousands without lifting a finger? ü•≥

5. **Customer Support Bots:**  
   Instead of stressing over endless customer queries, I harnessed AI chatbots to handle FAQs. Seriously, these little digital assistants can make your life SO much easier. Who needs to be glued to their phone like a puppet on strings? 

6. **Continuous Improvement:**  
   Using *analytics tools*, I kept track of what was working and what wasn‚Äôt. A/B testing became my best friend, and I adjusted my strategies accordingly. It‚Äôs like having a crystal ball, but more logical and way less mystical. ‚ú®

Now, I won‚Äôt sit here and say it‚Äôs all sunshine and rainbows. There were definitely bumps along the road (like the time my chatbot answered a query with a meme instead of a solution‚Äîawkward!). But each hiccup taught me something valuable.

**So, here‚Äôs the real takeaway**: *If you think this is out of reach, think again!* With the right tools and a little determination, you can totally automate your business without sacrificing your sanity or free time. We‚Äôre living in an exciting time where AI can genuinely help us streamline and elevate our ventures! 

**What about you?** Have any of you tried automating your processes? Or are you still on that good ol‚Äô classic grind? I‚Äôm just curious to hear how AI is shaking things up for you all!",1,1748117781.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

If you take everything away I will give you $200 (junk removal people want even more than that!!!). Need it out by Tuesday 

TBH most of the stuff might be able to be refurbished if you‚Äôre into that kind of thing. Except maybe for the sofas, they‚Äôre probably trashed. 


- wooden coffee table (decent condition, light weight)

- sofa x2 (they‚Äôre very used. Probably trashed)

- ikea kitchen table and 4 chairs 36‚Äùx60‚Äù (with leaf). Table could use refinishing (lots of rings lol) but it works well!!

- cheap ass bookshelf from target, flimsy kinda, 6ft tall it‚Äôs functional 

- breakfast bar and stools (about 24x48x36). Good condition, sits at counter height 


You must take everything for $200. Idc what you do with it after that. Hit me up! Pics upon request",1,1748117479.0,Albany,2,0.52,False
