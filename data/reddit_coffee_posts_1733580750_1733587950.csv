1h8vpm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1h8vpm8/i_love_black_tea/,"""I love black tea"" ","
Once, I came across a question online: why do people dislike bitter things? I‚Äôm no philosopher, but I answered, bitterness feels unspoiled, raw, and pure. Black tea, black coffee, dark chocolate, they‚Äôre bitter, perhaps because they remain untouched, in their truest form. Yet, people often crave sweetness instead, something softer, easier to love.

Perhaps that‚Äôs why he left. My love, like black tea, was too pure, too unfiltered, too bitter for him to savor. But I, a devotee of black tea, embraced his love as it was, both the sweetness and the flaws. I took it all in, and perhaps that‚Äôs what left me standing here, alone.

Still, I wait, sipping my black tea, its bittersweetness my only companion, hoping he‚Äôll return someday.",1,1733587799.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

(Willing to pay a little bit!)","To begin: I can be a little sensitive to criticism and that‚Äôs why I have been nervous to do this before. I posted one replay on a Facebook group and got torn to shreds by someone who wrote an essay about everything I did wrong and I basically felt like I did nothing right at all.

 But I‚Äôm going to to try it again.

I am willing to pay a little bit especially if someone is patient. I don‚Äôt know if people generally meet up on Discord or if you just send voiced over VODs or what. Honestly a voiced over VOD would probably be preferable.

I could do Cash App or Venmo, or I have some spare Amazon gift card from work (no spammy stuff, lol, I work for a big corporation and they randomly send $10 or $15 ones as thank you‚Äôd and I have a handful sitting I haven‚Äôt added to my account yet). 

Highest win rate support this season is Kiriko for me.

Supports I feel comfortable with in order: Ana, Kiriko, Moira, Juno

Supports I feel comfortable enough to play in QP but get nervous to pull them out in comp: Mercy (messy movement and tend to not be conservative enough with rezzes), Baptiste (I panic use his immortality a lot, and that + not utilizing his jump enough makes me scared to use him) 

I do not play any other supports unless I just haven‚Äôt finished my coffee and I‚Äôm forgetting someone. 

Extra points if you‚Äôre a woman because then I‚Äôd feel more comfortable meeting you up on Discord (sorry but it‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm a woman and getting alone on a Discord call can be a bit intimidating ‚Äî that‚Äôs another reason, I have tried to ask once or twice in OW discords and it turned into a dude or two being weird towards me offering to carry. While I don‚Äôt mind someone playing with me if they actually want to learn how I play, that wasn‚Äôt it).

I don‚Äôt know what the going rate is for coaching. If you have good karma on Reddit I‚Äôd be willing to do half first and half after so you know you won‚Äôt get ripped off.

I personally think we should encourage my son to buy his gf a gift. My son is much like his dad and doesn‚Äôt often think of others and their feelings. I want to encourage him early on to think of others in his life and what may bring them joy, especially around the holidays. 
Christmas also happens to be my favorite holiday ever since being an adult. I grew up poor and we often got gifts donated or had very minimal. So I have a bit of a complex about Christmas I‚Äôll add‚Ä¶. Gifting is also part of who I am. I love to be able to show my love for people with gifts, even small things like a coffee. However I am worried,  am I off base here? Is it appropriate for him to get her a gift?

If a gift is ok what do you get a child you‚Äôve never met/know minimally about? She is in middle school (12/13) and loves books. I know she is a great student and involved at school. What would be something he could get her that‚Äôs age appropriate for him to gift?

1h8viuk,https://i.redd.it/2ihbs2n09g5e1.jpeg,Royalton bavaro december 2024 review ,"Review of Royalton Bavaro Punta Cana

Overall, Royalton Bavaro Punta Cana offers an enjoyable experience for families and couples, with standout amenities and friendly staff. However, visitors should be prepared for some service-related challenges and plan accordingly. I‚Äôm enclosing contact information for Carlos, a reliable and friendly cab driver who enhanced our trip by helping with laundry and local tours.

Positives
	‚Ä¢	Convenient location: Only about 30 minutes from the airport.
	‚Ä¢	Spacious rooms: Comfortable accommodations.
	‚Ä¢	Friendly staff: Always welcoming and helpful.
	‚Ä¢	Outstanding pools: Fabulous pools, including a lazy river, kiddie pool, and the option to book a poolside cabana for added relaxation.
	‚Ä¢	Multiple bars: Conveniently scattered throughout the resort, with seating generally available.
	‚Ä¢	Buffet convenience: Open for all meals, with quick service and standard options.
	‚Ä¢	Kid-friendly: Evening and night shows cater to children, and there‚Äôs a vibrant evening ambiance for adults.
	‚Ä¢	Reliable housekeeping: Rooms are cleaned daily.
	‚Ä¢	Shopping and souvenirs: Coffee, chocolate, cocoa powder, local handicrafts, and larimar jewelry are excellent keepsakes.

Negatives
	‚Ä¢	Check-in process: Long and frustrating. Promised connected rooms were not delivered, and Diamond Club upgrades were unavailable despite being offered.
	‚Ä¢	Service delays: Room service is slow, and app-based service requests are restricted to 9 AM‚Äì6 PM.
	‚Ä¢	Jacuzzi issues: Ours was not functional and was never fixed despite repeated complaints.
	‚Ä¢	Food options: Limited off-hours food availability, repetitive buffet menus, and limited vegetarian-friendly options. Bakery offerings are below par.
	‚Ä¢	Reservations difficulty: Without Diamond Club, restaurant bookings are hard to secure.
	‚Ä¢	Overpriced resort services: Laundry and souvenirs are expensive.
	‚Ä¢	Luggage pick-up issues: Despite multiple calls, luggage was not picked up during check-out.

Tips for Visitors
	1.	Carry singles: Bring around $200 in singles for tipping during a week-long stay.
	2.	Book early: Make reservations for restaurants and pool cabanas as early as possible.
	3.	Avoid the Prime Travelers Club presentation: The sales pitch is intense, and the vacation club is not worth the cost.
	4.	Be patient: Expect a standard delay of 15‚Äì30 minutes for most services (‚Äúisland time‚Äù).
	5.	Bring a clothesline: Useful for drying clothes on the veranda.
	6.	Shop outside the resort: For better prices on souvenirs and essentials.
	7.	Vegetarian visitors: Expect basic options like salads, lentils, and rice at the buffet.
	8.	Carlos the cab driver: Reliable and helpful for local tours and errands. Contact info enclosed.

Final Thoughts

While there are service-related challenges and some food limitations, the pools, friendly staff, and overall ambiance make Royalton Bavaro Punta Cana a great destination.

I (17f) was excited to go because I thought we might go to the mall. I liked it because we all eat and talk, then everyone does their own thing. My dad and my sister (5f) go to play, my mom (40smth) and my twin (17f) go shopping, and I stay at the food court, watching shows or doing some homework, or we go to a restaurant. I'm a picky eater (not my best quality), I usually don't eat, and we pick up some food for me on the way back (it was their idea btw).

For context, I've had some health problems lately, I changed my diet, my health is better, and it's showing. So when we went out today, and insisted I eat there. I told him that it's more expensive here, and he refused. I told him that if they got to eat whatever they want, I get to eat whatever I want, but they guilted me into ordering.

Back to the story, we decided to go to a coffee shop after that my mom and twin went to and loved. On the way, we were discussing a school awards event (it's a thing where they give certificates every semester to the top ten students of every major). My mom doesn't usually come, but she decided to come to this one,I wanted to hide in the bathrooms, When I said this to my mom, she told me not to even dare do it. I told her I hate this stuff, and we don't do anything but walk in front of people (social anxiety),and take the certificate, She told me that I have to do it or she'll tell the teacher, I told her that she'll see my twin do it (it's her first time doing this), that I'd get to not do it, my sister would get to do it, and my mom would see one of us do it and be proud, and that's a win for all of us! My parents yelled at me for this. I got upset and decided to stay on my phone again for the rest of the ride.

when we got there, I was full already, so I told them not to get me anything (I think they thought I was being passive, but I was just full). We sat down, and I started writing this. My dad kept telling me to eat, I told him I was full. He got upset and told me to put my phone down, so I did, then picked it up 5 seconds later because he picked up his. They kept nudging me to eat (again), and I told them I was full (again). On the ride back, my dad finally lashed out and told me I ruined this day for them, and it was supposed to be a family thing. I told them that they didn't even listen to what I wanted, He told me to shut up as soon as I said that, so I just continued writing this post. AITA?

Sorry this post is long with a mundane story. When I tell stories, I usually drift off and start talking in details or other stuff, and I feel like I have to include details in this subreddit.

Sibarist trapezoid are a bit thick but very fast. You have to grind finer. About 50-100microns finer should do it and you can up dose as well if you want more body. 

Overall the sibarist seem to bring more balance to the cup and make the acidity more muted but still there but not as intense. Sweetness is also there but also balance as well as body.

The abaca seem to bring out more clarity and more acidity driven and slower than the sibarist and fellow filters. 

The fellow filters are very similar to the abaca but not as much acidity or clarity but rather more body (more testing needed). 

The sibarist filter although very fast still seem to be able to offer a good amount of body which I felt was lacking with the abaca but the clarity is a bit more balanced here. Overall very interesting and very good cups from the sibarist once dialed in. 

Coffee: Wilton Benitez Pink bourbon 
 Flavor notes: passion fruit, caramel and lemon 
Abaca filters: 650microns, total brew time: 3:45
Fellow filters: 650 microns, total brew time: 4min
Sibarist filters: 450microns, total brew time: 3.05min.

Then, I prepared a different breakfast, which was a change from my usual routine.

As always, my morning ritual wouldn‚Äôt be complete without a stop at **Starbucks for my coffee cravings**. ‚òï With coffee in hand, my plan was to dive into writing and proofreading the book, then check off some other pending tasks.

But here‚Äôs where the day took an unexpected turn‚ÄîI just didn‚Äôt feel like doing anything. ü´† For some reason, my mind is like, ‚ÄúShould I sit here ? Or maybe take a quick nap?‚Äù

Still thinking 

It‚Äôs funny how our brains sometimes wander in unexpected directions. Maybe today isn‚Äôt about productivity. Maybe it‚Äôs about giving myself the space to just be. What do you all do when your brain is in this zone? Work through it or lean into the nap? üòä

The same pods from the same sleeve taste better from the inissia than the citiz for some reason. 

I‚Äôve tried this with 2 pods at the same time for several mornings in a row now. Citiz pours a more bitter, almost burnt tasting espresso, while inissia has been consistently the same. I‚Äôve tweaked extraction timing and I‚Äôve reduced some of the burnt flavour but the coffee is more acidic than the same pod out of the inissia. 

Tried descaling the new Citiz machine and not sure it did anything.

The owner said he was using Mauro beans, which were available at the grocery store just next door, but for some reason I never made the switch. 

This past summer, I was in the Bari area of Italy and had another God shot that happened to use Mauro once again (it‚Äôs a Calabrese roast). They currently have a 30% robusta blend and a whopping 80%. I first got ahold of the 30% which was alright, but it had an annoying acidic aftertaste. 

I finally cracked open the 80% yesterday. Initial results were a bit wishy washy; pulls were around 40s. I lowered the dose to 14g and cranked the temperature to near-boiling‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and voila!  Dark chocolate heaven!  üí™üèºüí™üèº",7,1733586893.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

Without a medical provider, I have been trying to do what I can on my own. I really appreciate the posts about exercising and such because those are things I should be doing anyway!

One of the things I have been doing is logging things that seem to make it worse or better. For example, I have noticed that things are fine when I first wake up, but are worse after drinking coffee. Better after a glass of wine, worse when I am tired.

What are some other things I can test and log? I know everyone is different, but are there things that definitely seem to make it better or worse for you?",2,1733586789.0,EssentialTremor,1,1.0,False

1h8v5a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/KaffeBox/comments/1h8v5a2/day_7_amateur_review/,Day 7. Amateur review,"Today‚Äôs review comes in later than usually. Early in the morning I had an unfortunate incident involving container with fragrance sticks from another advent calendar tipping and spilling enough liquid to make our house smell like a chemical cedarwood forest. So I had to postpone the coffee tasting. Otherwise today‚Äôs pick would be described even funkier than yesterday‚Äôs pick :) But here we are. I promise, no cedarwood in this review from now on.

Not always, the beauty of coffee lies not in its wild unpredictability but in its ability to deliver a timeless, comforting experience. Today‚Äôs pick brought just that‚Äîa journey into the heart of classical coffee, with a hint of subtle elegance. After yesterday‚Äôs very fun and enjoyable funky Colombian Wush Wush experience, today‚Äôs pick brought a sense of balance and tradition to the table. This natural-processed varietal that I‚Äôve not had any experience with before (CentroAmericano) reminded me of the kind of coffee you‚Äôd savor at a cozy Christmas dinner or discover in a refined caf√© in Barcelona. It‚Äôs a coffee for those who appreciate the classics: rich, familiar, and easy to enjoy.

https://preview.redd.it/fplnop7j6g5e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db444efe3af3c89ac4e833ab96dc0c593fe740e4

To ensure I don‚Äôt get affected by the incident mentioned above, I had two brews today.

Brew #1: For the initial brew, I turned to the trusty 4:6 method with Origami. A 1:15 ratio (20g coffee to 300g water) paired with an Abaca filter and a 28-click grind on Comandante. Brew #2: Given the coffee‚Äôs refined profile, I decided to switch gears and embrace its classical nature with Tim Wendelboe‚Äôs Aeropress recipe. 14g/200ml

**ROAST:**

[Day 6 \(left\) vs. Day 7\(right\). Note a quacker right in the center](https://preview.redd.it/7cqsixjk6g5e1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=baaa00ecb50b7fae5d41d7f5ac60ee97fc07eea5)

The roast is light and comparable to yesterday‚Äôs Wush Wush. The beans look pretty clean. However, there were quite a few unevenly developed beans with a couple of quackers. Not a big deal though.

**AROMA:**

From the Canister: the aroma starts with a classic coffee vibe‚Äîdark chocolate and a touch of caramel and toffee. However, there‚Äôs a faint cardboard note initially, which doesn‚Äôt persist.

Ground Coffee: Once ground, the aroma intensifies. The chocolate becomes more dominant, complemented by caramel sweetness as a backdrop.

Brewed Coffee: Brewing brings out the best in this coffee. The aroma transforms into a delightful mix of maple syrup, chocolate, and dried fruits like prunes and raisins. It‚Äôs rich and inviting, perfectly suited to colder days.

**TASTE:**

**Brew #1:** Origami

https://preview.redd.it/r54znl4s6g5e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=013902b4c76633d7ac556395db3657dd4180bfcb

The first cup had a full body, leaning towards the heavier side of the spectrum. It‚Äôs dense and satisfying, with chocolate and prunes taking center stage. The aftertaste is long-lasting and dominated by prunes, accompanied by a creamy, marshmallow-like texture that adds to its appeal.

One important note: the brewing ratio makes a noticeable difference. At 1:15, the coffee shines with balance and richness. Increasing the ratio might create a heavier cup, which some might find overwhelming.

**Brew #2:** Aeropress

https://preview.redd.it/3e3on9ys6g5e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df3a2a640db07b54d636725f87ab53feb673c7c4

A cleaner cup overall compared to the first brew. Probably a bit underextracted (grinded at 25 clicks which is coarser than suggested 15-20 clicks) which brought some green aromas. But combined with a bit more prominent acidity, it give the coffee a refreshing lift. The chocolate notes remained, but the caramel sweetness took a step back a bit. Overall, it was a pleasant experience‚Äîan excellent pairing for a light dessert like macarons or shortbread.

This Costa Rican CentroAmericano is a step back into familiar territory, but in the best possible way. It‚Äôs a coffee that offers richness and balance without overwhelming complexity. It won‚Äôt blow you away with wild experimentation, but that‚Äôs its charm. It‚Äôs a coffee that invites you to slow down, savor the moment, and appreciate the craftsmanship behind its clean, natural processing. If you‚Äôre in the mood for something that pairs seamlessly with dessert‚Äîor just need a reassuring, grounded cup‚Äîthis is definitely a nice one to reach for.

If you‚Äôve been exploring experimental picks, this coffee is a welcome change of pace‚Äîclassic, dependable, and easy to enjoy.

Growing up Vacaville was a pretty great place for me. I‚Äôve always loved my environment. 2020 really shook things up for me. I‚Äôm white passing and didn‚Äôt give two flicks about politics as a young person. So, when the lights came on for me in 2020 it was a stark revolution of the town I thought I loved. To be fair, I did grow up near 7/11 apartments, in the 80-90s, aka pretty diverse, low income families. It‚Äôs been a solid 4 years and I feel Vacaville has only grown in its conservativeness.

The Oh Shirt Yeah gal just opens up a coffee shop that gives young, rich, conservatives. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong, please tell me I‚Äôm wrong!!! 

From as far as my research can tell, Vacaville has one mutual aid program that is not linked to a religious organization (this is important because many charities require sign up and have stipulations on who they will help). No queer spaces; our own mayor won‚Äôt fly the lgbtq+ flag. Instead we‚Äôre left with elementary teachers who worship god at a mega church in Sunday and show up absolutely shit-faced to work as kindergarten teachers, not arrested but quietly sent to the Travis school district instead.

I guess I‚Äôd like to know that I‚Äôm not alone! I still love living here with the community that I created. I love my kid is dating the nephew of someone I dated in high school. But, when I look over my fence, I see a public I don‚Äôt tend to agree with.

# Background

I‚Äôd run London Marathon in April ([race report](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1cayip5/london_marathon_2024_finally_a_decent_execution/)) after a solid training block. I'd been aiming for 2:43-2:45 and came away with a 2:45:03 and a performance I was very proud of.

Beyond a really enjoyable race, it gave me a lot of confidence that I could go faster and maybe get a London Marathon championship qualifying time (2:40 at the time). So I signed up for Valencia Marathon 2024 which would be just within the qualifying period and committed to another training block with that goal in mind.

# Training

After London it took me a while to get the motivation to get back into training. I'd say my training over the summer was hit and miss. I had the odd race, managed a 10k PB (just) in 34:35, did some bits in the fells for my club but annoyingly, I managed to roll my ankle really badly at the beginning of August requiring a whole week off. I struggled with this ankle issue on and off for the whole of the build into Valencia.

I had the same coach (Matt Rees) for this block I had into London. The training clearly worked for me there so I wanted to get the cumulative gains from more of the same.

These are the main takeaways from the build from mid August:

* It was the most consistent block I've done, I got up to 80km per week quickly, averaged 91km and peaked at 119km (for one week), mostly over 6-7 days a week.
* I struggled to hit all the runs prescribed, mainly missing the odd easy run here and there. This was just due to family and work commitments, but given some more discipline I think I could work on this in the future.
* I generally had 1-2 workouts a week (usually a threshold style session, e.g 12 x 1k threshold off 60 seconds, then maybe also something faster, e.g 1‚Äô reps).
* Almost all my long runs were workouts too, e.g 4 x 6k @ MP off 1k float. That session in particular was probably my best one of the block where I maybe started to think that I might be able to go convincingly under 2:40. Unfortunately after that run I struggled to repeat the success and struggled to complete my last few long runs to the same standard.
* I did *a lot* of my training on a treadmill, partly due to necessity with small children and time being limited, but I've also got quite used to it and maybe I‚Äôve become overly reliant on the ability to watch trash on YouTube whilst running‚Ä¶
   * That being said, I tried to do my key long runs towards the end of the block outside as much as possible for a bit more specificity.
* For nutrition, I trained with Precision Fuel and Hydration gels and carb drink. I did mini carb loads into my key long runs which I felt worked well and let me get the most out of these sessions. Also plenty of biscuits, but the jury is still out on if this was a help or a hindrance.
* I completely neglected to do any strength training, I had done it weekly into London so I was quite concerned about not having that for Valencia, and I think rightly slow on reflection.

I raced Manchester Half Marathon mid way through the block. I had planned to go out for 75/76, but accidentally latched onto the 71/72 group, only realising and slowing down after 5k. I set a 10k PB during it (so not an ideal way to race a half‚Ä¶) but managed to not blow up massively and came away with a big PB of 74:13. I‚Äôm pretty sure, had I not been an idiot, I could've brought it under 74 minutes. But anyway, even with my shocking ‚Äòstrategy‚Äô, this was a huge confidence booster for Valencia.

# Taper and race morning

My last long run was planned for 2 weeks before race day, but I had a bit of a wobble during the warm up and thought I was going to faint (this was actually a recurring theme throughout training that I never got to the bottom off, but often I'd have to cut a run or move it as I would start to feel faint). I ended up pushing that run to the next day (Monday), this meant my first week of taper was actually 98km, so not exactly ideal for a taper, I recovered well from the long run which went pretty well, hitting the expected paces, but having so much mileage so close to the race concerned me a bit. My coach didn‚Äôt seem concerned though and I‚Äôd had a decent mileage week the week before London and felt that hadn‚Äôt negatively effected me, so maybe I just do well off of a short and relatively aggressive taper.

The week of the race I ended up being incredibly stressed, busy work, stressful travel, stress for the race, probably more so than any other race I've done, far more than my normal pre race nerves. I think it may just be due to being the first race I've travelled far for, but it put me in a bad headspace that I struggled to shake before race day. I really need to work out better ways of managing this stress as I do think this contributed to my experience of the race itself.

We did our shakeout on Saturday morning in the park (Jard√≠n del Turia), only a few miles and some strides. It felt average, as expected, but I was just glad to get it out the way early and get an opportunity to see the finish area.

It was absolutely packed with runners including what seemed like half the elites doing their shakeouts. Crazy to see Bekele just jog by chatting. We also saw two elites doing their strides together, legs perfectly in sync, it was mesmerising to see.

After our shakeout, we went to the expo and queues for an hour in the sun to get our bibs, if I were to do Valencia again, I would travel out earlier and get this out the way on Friday at the latest.

I started carb loading on Thursday. I was aiming for 550g (\~9g per kg) of carbs on Thursday, then 650g (\~10g per kg) on Friday and Saturday. I think I generally hit that through a mix of pizza, pasta, bagels, fruit, carb drink (Precision Fuel and Hydration) and carb bars (OTE). I never really felt overly full or bloated.

My coach had suggested I go out at 3:41-3:42/km pace which had the potential of putting me in the position to get close to 2:36. This worried me a bit initially, as this felt quite aggressive, but I knew two people who were aiming for pretty much the same pace so it meant I‚Äôd have a group to work with. The thought of having the group and running a marathon at that pace really got me excited for racing.

On the morning of, I woke up feeling well rested and raring to go. I ate 1.5 bagels, a banana, had a coffee and a carb drink, showered and listened to some music to chill out.

We walked to the start, dropped our bags, queued for ages for a loo only to find when we were into the pen there were plenty of portaloos free (one to remember for next time), did a short warm up jog plus a couple of strides and lined up at the back of the green pen (2:30 ‚Üí 2:38) feeling very hyped. As an aside, ‚ÄòRobbie Williams - Let Me Entertain You‚Äô was playing on the loud speakers which felt like an interesting choice of motivational music, but hey, if it gets you going, why not.

# Race

**0-10k**

The gun went off and within a few seconds we were over the line and gently building up to pace. It was insane to be in such a packed group with hundreds of people around us, all ticking along at 3:40 ish per km.

Our mini group of three were aiming to come through half way in around 1:18 (3:42/km), with the intention of closing faster if possible. Within the first few km we were hitting the right pace but it felt surprisingly warm and sweaty, maybe the result of the sheer number of people around us.

I managed to roll my ankle (the dodgy one) in a crack in the road at 2km which caused a sharp pain, but I was pretty sure the discomfort would settle and shouldn‚Äôt cause problems later in the race.

At 5k I checked my heart rate (I always race with a chest HRM) as the effort level felt high and I didn‚Äôt want to commit to a pace that wasn‚Äôt sustainable that day. Usually my HR is very stable in a marathon, 154-158 bpm so I was expecting to see something similar, however it was actually 168bpm (much closer to my threshold), I decided to drop back to get it under control.

I probably dropped back only 20m or so and I could see my HR coming down with a minimal reduction (if any) in pace. Within a few km I‚Äôd caught back up to our group. HR was down and continuing to drop, we were cruising together again, on target. First bad patch over. I reminded myself that all bad patches are temporary (I obviously forgot this bit of self advice later in the race).

**10-20k**

With my HR down and us moving well, this section felt amazing. At points I had to really hold back and was having a lot of fun. I wouldn‚Äôt say the effort felt easy, but it felt right. I remember thinking, ‚Äòhow did I feel at London?‚Äô and this feeling a similar effort level. I saw a club mate who was out supporting at 14km and couldn‚Äôt help myself, I broke off from the group, shouted ‚Äòcome on!‚Äô and pumped my arms as he got a great video of me running past.

At around 18km we realised one of our group wasn‚Äôt immediately behind us, we struggled to look far back for fear of getting a stitch, but he usually closes well in a race so we thought he‚Äôd probably catch us soon, come blazing past and then completely drop us.

**20k-30k**

We came through half way in 1:18:17, a little bit off pace but nothing we were worried about. This was, after all, 3-4 minutes faster than I‚Äôd ever opened a marathon in, which felt incredible. The effort level had definitely started to creep up, but it didn‚Äôt feel much harder than London earlier in the year.

Beyond this things become a bit of a blur, but looking at my splits, I maintained pace till around 26km then started to drop off, by 30km, 3:42/km had turned to 3:50/km and my quads were starting to scream. I remember the elastic suddenly breaking with the one remaining guy in the group and the pace change felt like I had completely stopped. It was pretty soul destroying watching him disappear into the distance so quickly after being on each others shoulder up till now. This put me into a bad patch that I never got out of.

**30-40k**

By 32km, 3:50/km had turned to 4:00/km and I was trying everything not to stop, but just past that 32km sign I stopped for my first walk. It was horrible to be back walking in a marathon after London where I‚Äôd managed to keep it together for the first time, but my quads felt destroyed and like I just wasn't able to run on them at all.

I felt sorry for myself for a handful of seconds then got back to running. I was still through 32km in under 2 hours, so up till this point I hadn't deviated that much from my initial goal.

I managed another 2k at around 4:00/km pace then walked again.

For the next few km I flipped between a short walk then getting back to a decent pace for a bit, but always my quads were screaming and I felt utterly defeated. I knew sub 2:40 was disappearing and honestly I had just given up mentally by this point. I felt utterly crap for walking after so much progress in the year prior, all these negative thoughts just swirling around, guaranteeing I would continue to throw my goals away.

As we hit the city centre again, the noise suddenly hit me, I felt I hadn't really noticed it all morning but this was so deafening. I really wasn't expecting it, but it felt louder and more intense than I had experienced in London.

**40k-Finish**

The noise through the centre and seeing the 40k sign gave me a kick and I just told myself, ‚Äò8 minutes, of course you can run for 8 minutes‚Äô. So I picked myself up, started slow and then just sped up all the way to the finish.

I saw a guy cut someone up in the final km and knock them over. He came down too but then just sprinted off, leaving the other guy floundering on the floor struggling to get up.

As we hit the blue carpet and that final downhill stretch, I saw on my watch I could still sneak under 2:43, I had to give it everything, I felt it would bring me some redemption for what had otherwise been a disappointing second half.

With 100m to go, that same guy who knocked the other runner down cut me up (I had overtaken him after his fall), so suddenly I almost hit the deck too, I may have expressed my distaste quite loudly‚Ä¶

Anyway, it didn't matter, I crossed the line and saw I‚Äôd got under 2:43. A solid 2+ minute PB.

# Post race

I was wallowing a bit in self pity and annoyance at my race, however the long walk to the bag drop gave me some time to reflect, acknowledge the PB, the hard work and be grateful for the ability to come out to Valencia and run such an amazing event, even if my personal race hadn't been what I wanted.

But we shot for an aggressive goal, and sometimes you miss, and that's fine, I'm so much happier that I tried and it‚Äôs made me hungry for more.

# What‚Äôs next

* Strength training. I‚Äôm almost positive this was my downfall, of course I may have been running beyond my fitness, and maybe a bit. But I feel the style of blow up I experienced and the feeling in my quads during and after was due to a lack of strength.
* Working on my mental game. I definitely let the stress pre race and the negative thoughts during take over. This couldn't of helped my race.
* I‚Äôve gone back and forth with whether I should take a break and run easier at London or go all in. Part of me would love the break, but I feel I have a solid few back to back marathon blocks to build further on and my fitness has jumped a lot, even just from earlier this year, so I want to fully commit to a big London block and give myself every opportunity to surprise myself.

I never thought I'd meet someone from reddit. But ended up making a friend who is now leaving Gurgaon for good. Very thankful to this sub honestly that got to meet her and more people on this sub who became part of our mutual growth journey. God, before I met her, my room was a mess, I had no idea how to dress / style myself, I was desperate for love. She came into my life as a guardian angel - very patiently allowed me to heal alongside her and taught me to be a decent person. In the past one year, I have upgraded like anything and have been attracting really good energy. As she moves out of the country, I feel overwhelmed with all the great memories we created together. And although I'm very happy for her, I feel like I've lost the one good person I found in ncr. :(.

Last night, I saw Vince (not his real name) for the first time in three weeks (he'd been away on a family/holiday and business trip). Right off the bat, I felt unnatural, like I was ""trying too hard."" Before the date, I did some deep breathing to try to calm myself down, but after I stepped into his apartment, as soon as we finished hugging and kissing, I immediately thought, ""What am I going to talk about? How can I meaningfully connect with him over what's happened in our lives these past three weeks?"" For the next five hours, I became an overly-polite, awkward mess. I had wanted to bring up the fact that I'd been offered a raise at work, but never even remembered to mention that! 

It even seemed like my awkwardness was rubbing off on him, like, for example, we didn't even seem to know how to share a plate of food together without the food dropping on the table or floor! 

I also found myself apologizing too much, like when I kept adjusting myself on the couch with him. Another instance of me apologizing too much was after I had already apologized for my teeth scraping his penis during fellatio, I apologized again for it while we were eating dinner! Like, that barely warranted a first apology, never mind a second one! He even said, when I apologized during dinner, ""Babe, I need you to not have anxiety over this. You did great! An A+ job!"" I don't want him to get annoyed with my over-apologizing, which obviously I don't do on purpose, but it stems from a lack of confidence. 

Prior to dinner, when he was making us coffee in the kitchen, I didn't know where to stand. The conversation felt too polite, talking about preferred coffee making methods and whether or not a manual grinder is better than electric - not exactly fodder for deep, meaningful conversation! 

At one point, I awkwardly brought up the topic of five-year goals. Vince said he just wanted to see how far he could go with his business, that it was really important to him to see how far he could go when he set his mind to something. He said traditional goals, like marriage and children didn't appeal to him. While I don't feel I must get married or have children to feel fulfilled, when he said that, it felt like I was being left out of the picture. 

While he was sweet, considerate, and affectionate during the date, he didn't respond in kind when I told him I had never felt for any other person the way I felt for him (although earlier on when I had said I was crazy about him, he did say he was crazy about me, too). 

When he was telling me about his business partner's son having been adopted, it brought to mind my childhood experience of going to a foster home, so I tried segueing into it. While I was talking about the reason I had gone to a foster home, which was because I had told my school counselor when I was in 5th grade that my father had inappropriately touched me, I said to him that I was sorry if it was making him uncomfortable, and he replied that it was okay, that he understood that my foster home experience related to the topic of his business partner's son having been adopted. Still, I wonder if it might have made him see me differently, or if it might not have been an appropriate conversation to have with him yet. 

As soon as I got home last night, I texted him, ""Hi, babe! I just got home. Thank you for everything tonight - the cuddles, the gift, dinner, the sexy time, lol! I love the little alligator ornament! It's got a special place in my collection, along with the Pooh ornament you got me. I hope I can see you again soon! Get some rest 'cause I know you're beat. Good night! üòò,"" to which he promptly responded, ""Glad you made it home safe babe! Thank you for the coffee and chocolates‚Ä¶and all the rest too üòâ Maybe if you‚Äôre free Sunday I could come up by you and we could check out the Christmas stuff at (shopping center)?"" I replied, ""Yeah, let's do it! They've got the tree up and Santa's house, so it looks very festive! We can also check out (store name) there. On the top floor, they've got a (coffee shop name) and lots of cute gifts, games, and more. What time were you thinking?"" Vince replied, ""Would early afternoon be good so we could get lunch there? Or do the vibes feel more christmas-y after the sun goes down?"" Me: ""The vibes are Christmas-y at any time of the day, but I say we do early afternoon; that way, we can spend more time together üòö"". Vince: ""That works for me üòä I‚Äôll see you Sunday then! Have a good night, babe! üòò"". Me: ""Sunday it is! Good night, babe! üòò"" and then Vince liked my text with a heart emoji. 

What do you think of all this?

TL;DR: Due to past traumas, I struggle with being myself when dating, and I'm not talking first dates - I mean, when feelings have developed for a particular man, I overthink everything and become reticent, clammed up, awkward, etc. I'm afraid I'm going to cause someone special I'm seeing to lose interest in me and want to know if there's hope for salvaging the relationship given the last date we had.

I made a cup with the 078, pre-seasoning, with the Pulsar, to try and limit pouring and swirling variables and whatnot. The difference between the grinders is NOT subtle. The cup from the 078 was bright, juicy and punchy, and despite not being a clarity monster, I could still pick apart flavors to a degree that wasn‚Äôt possible with the 64 brew. I know some have said they couldn‚Äôt tell much of a difference, but at least for me, it was a noticeable change in cup quality. 

Seasoning was a breeze, and the motor did not heat up AT ALL despite running 5 lbs through it inside of about an hour to an hour and a half, with breaks just to vacuum as I went. I‚Äôm on the fence about the need to run the other 5 lbs through. Btw for anyone looking to season a new grinder, Prodigal sells 10 lbs of seasoning beans for like $30 plus shipping. It‚Äôs cheaper than grabbing cheap bags from Costco, and the house didn‚Äôt smell like burnt coffee afterwards which was great. 

Made 3 side by side brews today of a yeast inoculated washed Ecuadorian yellow maracaturra produced by Angel Carrion and roasted by Enjoy Coffee Roasters in Providence, RI. All were 12/200, 3 pour (60/70/70) V60s at 6, 8 and 10 grind sizes. Water was 60/20 GH/KH at 92C. My pin is moved 2 holes left of stock, so 0 is just off chirp. The brew times bumped by about 12 seconds with each grind size move, so ~ 1:48, ~ 2, and ~ 2:12 min respectively for the 10, 8 and 6 grind sizes. 

I finally got off of the astringency train at the 10 grind size, but definitely sacrificed some body and punchiness to get there, as it was the most subtle of the bunch. The most vibrant cup was at 8 grind size, and had the most notable mandarin and mango present, which are two of the tasting notes. The 6 cup felt muddied relative to the other two. Obviously this is just one coffee, but figured it was worth sharing for anyone who might find the info useful. I‚Äôll probably hover around a 9 for now to split the difference in the cup qualities I found, and play around with drippers. Feel free to share your own experiences with the 078 so far!

1h8uoiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1h8uoiz/stop_getting_hung_up_on_fluent_its_a_ruse/,"Stop getting hung up on fluent, it‚Äôs a ruse.","I feel that many people are getting too hung up on this idea of what fluent means. This is a curse from academia, especially in the western sense where we want to quantify and become logicians over everything minute detail. To give an example, I had a student the other day jokingly tell me that I sound like I learned through a dictionary because my grammar and word choice is quite precise and ‚Äúextremely educated‚Äù, sometimes a little too educated, to the point of sounding stiff quite rigid (not native). 


The other day I was getting coffee and I had a quick conversation with the security guard outside, I could hear the mistakes he was making in the language, and what I mean to say is that I could hear parts of his speech that in the back of my mind, I knew I had studied like a madman all through undergraduate and understood that he not using correct tense here or there. Would we say that person is less fluent than I? Absolutely not, we would just say that there is a difference in education. 

Further, what is a true measure of fluency? Is it ‚Äúeloquence‚Äù or is it relatable dialogue that is quickly constructed and reciprocated without delay? 

I would argue the latter, and I used to believe the former!

In my own native language, I‚Äôve had many instances where I‚Äôve had trouble reading texts because I didn‚Äôt understand what the author was saying nor did I understand some of the wordage that was used. Would people say because I couldn‚Äôt understand certain words nor the context of a topic, such as the transcribed version of the phenomenology of spirit by Hegel, that I‚Äôm not fluent in English?

The idea of fluency is that you‚Äôre able to have smooth communication without major disruptions in a language. Please don‚Äôt get hung up on all the little details or the small tests that reward you with a certificate showing how stellar you are, there‚Äôs probably a native speaker out there who couldn‚Äôt pass that test yet is obviously more fluent than you‚Äôll ever be.

(Sit down, long and confusing one here) ","For context. Im 18 and hes 22. Shes 61. Hes still saving to move out , and im looking for a job. Grandma also has a job because she refuses to stop working .( she only works half a shift at subway, so its not a hard job. At all. You make literal sandwiches all day.) me and him recently purchased our first pet TOGETHER.   Ive had pets before , and he has to, but we have never had one together . It is a kitten , we will call her ‚Äúkitty‚Äù. Kitty is 7months old, and spends alot of her time sleeping , and eating. She dosent play as much as we wouldve hoped but its ok! . This is important. How she spends her time , and her age. Back on topic, his grandma likes to wake us up everyday at 4-5am,, by grabbing the kitten and getting it all hyper and by giving her catnip first thing in the morning , today was my last straw i think. Its 4:30am ish,, i wake up to hear her with the cat upstairs (shes yelling at the cat as loud as she can to ‚Äúget out of the way‚Äù and to ‚Äúleave the dog alone ‚Äú (because apparently the kitten is hurting the dog. The dog is so matted you cant feel the skin, i doubt the dog can feel the cat jumping on it. Cat never hurt the dog before . Shes just looking for an ‚Äúexcuse‚Äù to punish the kitten.  I got my boyfriend to send her a quick message ‚Äúbring the cat down, its to early for her to get zoomies .‚Äù She proceeded to STOMP down to our bedroom, swing open the door while we are both basically half asleep(he sent her the message and passed back out after , hes a deep sleeper . I was ABOUT to drift back off .) she flicked on every light leading to his unit , and every light in his room. She threw the cat at us. Whipped it even. The cat is 109% fine i checked , shes just scared of grandma now. I politely said ‚Äúnext time can we just sit her on the floor?‚Äù She told me to shut up and to literally kms.. over a cat.. a 61 yr old told me to take my own life , a 18 yr olds life, over a cat, over being told to bring thr cat down as theres no reason to be screaming at it at 4:30 am! . This has been happening ALOT recently . She has heavily targeted me to the point i had to block her number as she would spend all her time at work spam calling me to belittle me over temporarily dropping a few classes to keep up with my hobby. (I am 100% in school again . She has no need to be borderline harassing me over it  . Im not even her kid. Im DATING her grandson. ) im just truly getting sick of the things she says , and does . The kitten can somehow open a 15 pound inframe set door, get upstairs SOMEHOW MYSTERIOUSLY, and reak havoc. Four nights ago i was drunk off my ass , im playing with kitty laying on the floor beside his units door ,, , his nan sits down infront the foor on the other side and starts playing with kitty,, from under the door and through it . She then went to open the door but instantly slammed it once she noticed me staring at her . I directly caught her doing exactly what she said she wasn‚Äôt doing. ‚ÄúThe CATS been opening the door to get upstairs!‚Äù Is bullshit and i know it was! They own a very large house ok? This cat is so so small. They have alot of danger here in the house , ESPECIALLY because kittys size. Kitty was supposed to stay in his unit untill she was atleast 1yr. Shes already 6-7 months old so she wouldnt have to wait long to explore . His grandma didnt listen because clearly she knows everything and anything possible . So now the cat spends alot if its time , up in her unit ,, eating things it shouldnt , like dog food. And human food . And garbage , because if she brings kitty up, it means leave all her belongings locked away in his unit ., aka, dont bring up her food or water all day. Dont bring up her litter box . Leave it all where she cant get jt then punish her when she poops on the floor infront of thr unit door . Or punish her when she gets into your coffee because shes hungry and thirsty because shes been upstairs all day! Moral,, the door..  its animal proof... Its a door specifically animals cant open. Grandma over here thinks we are stupid and dont know shes the one opening the door at 4am everyday. And she thinks we dont know shes giving kitty human food.BUT  Im pretty sure kitty being bloated as hell after being up there all day , and being sick / vomit /liquid poop after being up there all day, means shes getting fed human food! And its making her sick ! . Grandma is being stupid and saying stupid things to me. I cant keep doing it . Im going to snap . I studied vet care ,, seeing her do this causes me lots of anger towards her .  And just to be 100% clear, she never paid anything for kitty, hasnt bought ANYTHING for kitty. Boyfriend and i, paid for kitty to come home. Kitty is legally OUR cat. On the paper , OUR cat.
Not hers, but shes telling everyone shes mommy and its HER cat.. kitty does not respond to her name because while we legally named her kitty(not real name js example for the story)she goes around calling it peppa, or something else completely different from her REAL name . Kitty wont respond to kitty, kitty refuses to eat kitten food because she keeps getting given canned wet dog food and human food .(Chinese food, stirfry,  stew. Chilli. Etc. ) im truly just upset . I can handle the backhanded comments i get from her , i can handle her belittling me and making incredible scenes when she dosent get her way (like a toddler ) , but i cannot handle her borderline abusing a baby animal because ‚Äú thats how i did it when i was a kid‚Äù.. yeah grandma.. a kid 40 yrs ago.. things have changed and your ruining everyones life thats around you, or close to you. She also pretends to have dementia to get what she wants . I have proof its faked . No one believes me tho, but if you saw what i see when i see her ,, you‚Äôd believe me just as much as i believe . Am i wrong for feeling so deeply worried and upset ?   She literally gave his last pet cat diabetes and heart failure,, (happened YEARS ago. , she was feeding cat nothing but human food and take out, refused to get it taken to the vet, cat had to get put down bc diabetes was so bad the medication wouldn‚Äôt have done anything , and his heart was so weak. She CANNOT own pets . But everyone of her family thats her age and up, says she can. So she gets animals . She owns 7 budgies in a 2ft by 2ft cage . Ive offered to give her my 6ft parrot cage . She got mad at me . She said her birds are fine and are happy. Her birds never make sound. They are constantly raping eachother . LITERALLY. Cage full of males, but one.

I felt undesirable, unattractive..sexually unappealing

there was such a rough phase,i would have so many issues with alcohol and self harm..months spent drinking until sickness,eventually i slowed down but i kept suffering

blood,i couldn't get out of bed from the cinder blocks tied to my ankles made out of depression,hatred,evy and feelings of unworthyness

I liberated myself through my own blood, I would skip classes and self harm all day until the crimson smell of tormented blood filled the room

death marched towards me, and I hoped it would complete its march..i was fine with dying since a young age and if in life I was never wanted I would be liberated in death

but it never came.
it never did.

it was a cold winter, the kind of cold that slowly gnaws at your own skin, but in my mind it started to be spring

I felt as if I was lying on beds of flowers, and even as I was bruised, battered and bleeding something was forming..some kind of hope

maybe it was not my time to die yet, so I twisted my own fate

someone who seemed to want me found me..but it was a lie

every time I attracted someone it was never because they found me attractive, always because they wanted a romantic partner, someone to settle with..and the same went with her

i broke up with her after she kept shaming me for being a virgin..months later she accused me of kidnapping her..tragicomedy at it's peak

the dulleroded switchblade..that brown tint, it looks like coffee but the smell of your own blood you can never forget

the pills of xanax..the ones i used to push myself further during the mutilation of my own self

spirits, the spirits I used to drink first thing in the morning

..death,death wanted me..and i wanted death,but something inside of me just refused to die

that spirit of survival..no amount of mutilation could snuff out and to this day I have no idea what it is

life enforcing..all i wanted was to die

the blade could barely open, the blood eroded it's opening mechanisms, almost as if my own old blood was telling me 'please, not again'

yes, again,and again.
it's over.

i woke up with the smell of blood on me,my skin tore open

blood was running down on me,like all the tears i could not shed during years of agony having new life through the blood i shed

eventually,i would have reached my release,every single cut led me one step closer to freedom

a slave which bangs his own head against the wall,with every single strike leading him closer to the eternal peace

..how i got here now,i have no idea..

i started making friends,enjoying the night life and finally,some people started wanting me


..i am so close,but every time i go to sleep i feel the reaper running his hand through my hair like a mother would to lull her own child to sleep

every waking minute i spend in lonelines..i am doubting my decision

I wanted to let you know we have softly opened a brand new cafe at 313 Mass Ave in Central Square. It's called the Smoot Standard, named after the man Ollie Smoot himself!

We're open 8-2 today and tomorrow for coffee, breakfast, and lunch, and offering 20% off for our opening weekend as we work out the kinks. 

We'll probably stick to a Wed-Sun schedule at least through the holiday season. We also have a full bar and dinner menu that will be kicking off in the next few weeks, along with online ordering, delivery, catering, etc. 

You may have seen me post about my restaurants before, I'm also the owner of Naco Taco and Lily P's in Cambridge. Please come through and say hello (I'm Alex and wearing the green Smoot Sweatshirt)! I promise no more shameless self-promotion!

It was a no-name investment banking firm in a mid-sized city. I wanted my parents' approval, and it was the only college internship offer I had, so I took it. The office itself was nondescript but nice enough inside, it sat on top of a hookah lounge and a fair-trade coffee shop in an art deco-style building where the cold brew was eight dollars. The owner was a catty man who always made it seem like you were interrupting his day by coming in. He wore the same thing every day, and I told him he reminded me of a cartoon character in that regard. On my first day, I was laughingly told about a man my coworkers had watched die on the sidewalk outside. I should have thought about this revelation more, the fact that they would tell me something like that on the first day.¬†

I realized quickly that most of my coworkers were insane in some form or another. My associate, with whom I was staffed on most deals, carried a gun everywhere. Once, when it was just us two in the office on a Saturday, he let me hold it. It was a Sig Sauer, it felt nice in my hand. He told me that sometimes when he drove home, he would hold it in his hand just under the window in case something happened. I told him he sounded paranoid. He would take me on walks and berate any homeless people who asked us for cash and talked about killing ""third-worlders"" and the homeless. I should mention that we were running mergers and acquisitions for middle market companies, yet everyone in the office thought we were doing God's work. At one point, my managing director told me he wanted to turn our firm into the Goldman Sachs of the South. I said okay and went back to my desk. One day I was given a company Amex and tasked with finding a water gun. I figured it was for a prank, and, being the intern, I obliged. I soon found out I was an accomplice to their new favorite pastime: spraying sleeping homeless people from the windows of our office. I asked them if they thought this is why people hated bankers, they shrugged.

Towards the end of my stint, we hired a new analyst, a boarding school type who wore Golden Goose and who we thought was schizophrenic. On his first day, he told us that we were all inferior to him because he left a respected bank to work here. He was incredibly short and skinny and wore black Hunter rain boots if there was the slightest chance of rain. I joked that he looked like he would make a good jockey at the Kentucky Derby; he didn't find it funny. My internship program ended soon after, and I concluded I never wanted to work in banking ever again. This is not an exit.

I‚Äôm still not well-versed when it comes to tasting specialty coffee or home brewed pourovers but this cup tasted sweet with a hint of acidity (since one of the tasting note was lemon tea). Mouthfeel was very light with no astringency.

Rating: 5/5 


This was the first time I ordered a pourover from a cafe/beverage space since mostly espresso-based lang yung inoorder ko before I explored filter coffee. After finishing the whole thing,  narealize ko na bitter/astringent yung first few cups that I made and mas gusto ko iimprove yung tasting and brewing sa V60 + explore other recipes, brew ratio, and beans.

The only options are Vertuo Pop, Pop+, Next, Next Premium and Next Deluxe.

They also sell the Lattissima and Creatista but because I also purchased the Aeroccino 4 with the Pop; it‚Äôs a waste of money.

Today is the beginning of our 12 Days of Christmas celebration and for day 1 we are releasing our Barley‚Äôs Cask Strength IPA Whiskey. It‚Äôs available for purchase and to sample at the distillery. 

Here are the details: we distilled a batch of Barley's Tour de Hops #14 double IPA and it has been aging for about three years. It‚Äôs at the point where the balance of the hoppy flavor of the distillate and the barrel influence are optimal. This is a hop forward whiskey but with enough age on it to give it some balance. When IPA is distilled the bitterness is left behind and what you end up with in the spirit are the wonderful fruit and floral aromas and flavors. 

We only had one barrel of this so it‚Äôs going to be a tasting room exclusive. I'm really happy with how this whiskey has turned out. If you've ever had the whiskey we distilled from a Brew Dog blueberry IPA this is quite different.  It has a much more intense hop aroma and taste and was aged in the barrel longer to stand up to that.  Even if you aren't interested in buying a bottle we would still love for anyone who is curious to come down and try it, we are really proud of this one.

We‚Äôve also got batch 2 of our Death Before Decaf coffee liqueur out. Thank you to everyone who gave us feedback on batch 1! We made some tweaks to the second batch. We upped the sugar a bit (though it‚Äôs still about 1/8 of what you‚Äôd find in Kahlua) and refined our infusion process a bit to improve the overall flavor. Please keep the feedback coming!  We plan to continue some small evolutionary tweaks until we get this perfect. 

Sling & Stone Whiskey batch 1 is still on the shelf as well. This is our blend of bourbon and pot distilled whiskeys. The feedback on this one has been amazing and we plan to start putting a blend together for batch 2 soon. 

Everyone is welcome to come down and sample these, or any of our other spirits. Shop hours today are 2PM - 6PM. Our address is 590 Ste D Oakland Park Ave, Columbus 43214. We really appreciate your support!",6,1733583767.0,OhioLiquor,4,0.88,False

For context: I (23F) work from home and my shift starts at 3AM. My BF (24M) is an ER nurse with mixed shifts.

He was off duty when we decided to get some BBQs, Isaw, Tokong, etc. for meryenda. While waiting, nakita naming may coffee shop sa tapat so we also went to get coffee since minsan lang din makapag fancy coffee. He wanted Spanish Latte and I bought Matcha Latte with the hopes of still getting some sleep before my duty.

Fast forward after dinner, around 8PM, nakahiga na ako and just scrolling through Tiktok at nagpapaantok. He was playing PUBG, like usual, and would lie down around 10PM. That was his usual routine pag walang duty which is totally okay with me because I get to watch KDramas (which are not his forte)

Ang tagal ko nagpapaantok until 10PM came and he‚Äôs already finished playing pero di pa rin ako makatulog. I think sumipa na rin ang kape sa sistema niya kaya hindi rin siya makatulog. Nagkulitan muna kami, nanood ng reels, nag asaran at nagdecide na manahimik para sana makakuha pa ako ng konting tulog before my shift. It was already 12AM. Pumikit ako, sobrang tagal kong nakapikit hindi man lang ako nakatulog talaga. I was so frustrated because I won‚Äôt get any sleep before my shift starts. I turned to my BF whose eyes were closed. I wasn‚Äôt sure if he was sleeping but I didn‚Äôt want to wake him up just because I was still awake.

I tried closing my eyes again. Wala talaga. Timecheck, 2AM na. That‚Äôs when I decided na babangon na ako kasi wala na talagang pag asa na makatulog ako.

When I got out of bed, nagulat ako when he also stood up. He held my hand and said, ‚ÄúBaby, anong gusto mong gawin ko?‚Äù referring to what he can do since I can‚Äôt sleep.

OA na kung OA, pero nahaplos talaga puso ko. He never calls me baby but he calls me babygirl as a joke and to tease me like a cringe boyfriend. 

He hugged me and I just said he should sleep and I will be starting working. I love hugging him so much! He brings me comfort.

I‚Äôve been resentful the past few days because I‚Äôm burnt out. But him doing this made me realize there are lots of things I should be grateful for. Kahit pagod sa duty at toxic, he never treated me bad. I‚Äôve suffered a lot from my previous relationship and meetimg my current BF is so much to be thankful for. I wish he knew how much he healed me and motivated me to become a better person.

I hope everyone finds someone who can bring them comfort and love.

I opened it up and couldn‚Äôt tell where it was coming from so we restored power and everything worked fine. We soon then learned all the power strips and the coffee maker were fried. Fast forward to now and we had another loud pop with no smoke, things got fried again, and now it‚Äôs weird. When connected to shore power everything powers on like it should but when I plug something into a outlet and power it on all AC appliances and outlets go out completely, and when I turn that device back off the power is restored again. I originally thought it was the power converter but I don‚Äôt understand how that would interfere with the AC outlets/appliances. Did we blow something in the electrical panel? Any help would be appreciated:)

Edit: We have a 50 amp rv, and oddly enough after letting it sit all night I plugged the rv back in and everything works fine again. ",1,1733583332.0,RVLiving,6,0.67,False

1h8u4jv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h8u4jv/dispatcher/,Dispatcher ,"I‚Äôm a first responders dispatcher, I work on a 2 week pay schedule first week is 4 days of 12a-12p the second is 3 days 12a-12p. I handle everything from calls requesting life alert helicopters for dear stuck on icy lakes to fires, disputes and medical emergency‚Äôs. My town has a population of 2k and the county population can go from 15k-22k depending on season. Generally nothing happens 12a-6a aside from elders falling on their way to the bathroom or unattended deaths. Unattended deaths are not murders but people passing in their home alone either from heart attacks or old age there found by visitors checking in. 

Background and helpful information: 39 means a city officer 56 is county so 3901 is city sheriff and 5606 is county sheriff. Our fire and ambulance is all volunteer so it can take 5 minutes too 1-4 hours to get a response from pages out and calling personnel phones Generally locals don‚Äôt call 911 for amb but to pass word to next towns hospital, we don‚Äôt have one in my town, we only have a place for bruised knees and common colds. Things we don‚Äôt note down are ‚Äòghost calls‚Äô there a 911 call from a 911 num, 000 num and sometimes [      ]. We don‚Äôt know why they come in but assume that there a rouge current in the line, since they don‚Äôt geo locate on any of our tracker maps, allow for a call back option, and when we stay on the line there‚Äôs no sound aside from a rhythm of soft buzz trailing in and out. 

My weekly routine guarantees I see the same exact people every morning for 24/7 pbt test. It‚Äôs a probation check for dui drivers so they can work and not go to jail for a few months. The same three people come in every morning at 7am. First is Greg he‚Äôs a older guy a little short looks like a angry logger, he‚Äôs never late always shows up at 7:02a and if he‚Äôs late he always makes it in before 7:15a. He‚Äôs a nice guy always happy to get back to work without delay. 
The next is Ms. Paige she‚Äôs always almost late. They have to be tested between 7a-8a and no later unless court ordered. Paige always shows up between 7:40a-7:55a she‚Äôs been late a few times. Being late means a strike on the check in record and if you get too many you‚Äôll be sent back to jail of removed from the program. She‚Äôs not my favorite, complains a lot and talks too much. 
The last one is Issac, he‚Äôs my favorite he‚Äôs permitted to test between 6a and 7a he‚Äôs always on time too between 6:20 and 6:30. He‚Äôs always polite and respectful. I think he works for the local lumber yard/train yard. The job sites are connected and my town main export is pine lumber via train. The tracks end 3 miles north of town they used to go into Canada but were removed to make room for the koocanusa and its dam, they removed a whole town too. 

They‚Äôre listed in order of when they were added to the system, or I think so. I took this job because I‚Äôm slightly obsessed with consistency. I don‚Äôt like when the regular way something works gets flipped, I can‚Äôt work a job where each day may be different I need a constant flow of rules and procedures. I finally found my job, I enter warrants, protection orders, run vehicles and handle a system of calls and because government is very strict the procedure will not change and I know how to respond each time. That leads me here now, when a pbt blower finishes the program there name becomes grayed out and they are sorted to the bottom of the list, they don‚Äôt remove them in order to have record of each day and every test. It‚Äôs my job to let the probation officer who doesn‚Äôt show who failed the test and if the website isn‚Äôt working.

Today being my Friday I was getting ready to test Paige, she never showed up and I went to mark her for today but she wasn‚Äôt on the list anymore. I checked the bottom of the list and she wasn‚Äôt listed there either. I gave the probation officer Allie a call and he sounded very busy and brushed me off with a quick, ‚ÄúWho, what I don‚Äôt have time if someone didn‚Äôt show just have whoever gets on shift first go check there place out ok.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äú and he hung up. Right now I do have a county officer on shift but he‚Äôs not 10-8 yet and I don‚Äôt know when he will call on. This isn‚Äôt a call out and the on duty officer has a nasty morning attitude. I‚Äôm going to wait for him to call on shift and get coffee before sending him out. I think she wasn‚Äôt the most pleasant person to deal with, I think she was just annoying. 

If anything was explained poorly or anyone wants a better explanation please don‚Äôt be afraid to ask. I‚Äôm trying my best to write this on my phone it may be messy. You can call me by my user, U56729 or dispatcher 662, I‚Äôm going to make a strong pot of coffee and get rid of this headache take care.

Together, they formed an unlikely squad, known as **The Handsome Heroes of Absurdity**.  

---

### **The Call to Action**
One day, the peaceful planet of Swagtropolis was under siege by the evil overlord Swagnificent, whose plan was to steal the universal ""Rizz Crystal""‚Äîthe very source of everyone's magnetic allure. Desperate, the citizens of Swagtropolis summoned the only beings powerful enough to stop Swagnificent: The Handsome Heroes.

---

### **The Squad Gathers**
- **Lego Batman**: Perched atop a blocky Lego skyscraper, Lego Batman was brooding (as always). ‚ÄúJustice calls,‚Äù he muttered. As he leapt into his human-sized Lego Batmobile (which made clunky *click-clack* sounds), he tossed out a *Lego Batarang* for dramatic effect.  
- **Chicken Little**: Meanwhile, Nerd Chicken Little was finishing his latest equation, solving for ‚ÄúWhy am I so ridiculously cute?‚Äù Adjusting his oversized glasses, he packed his emergency inhaler and a tech device shaped like an egg into his backpack.  
- **Mbapp√©**: Athlete Mbapp√© was mid-game, about to score the most epic goal in the Intergalactic Soccer League championship. When he heard the call, he effortlessly kicked the ball into the goal *from space*, grabbed his cleats, and sprinted to Swagtropolis faster than light.  
- **Dreadhead Eugene**: Eugene was chilling on a cosmic hammock, sipping on his favorite iced coffee, and scrolling through memes. ‚ÄúBruh, I guess I‚Äôll pull up,‚Äù he sighed, rolling off his hammock and casually sauntering through a wormhole.  

---

### **The Epic Battle**
When they arrived on Swagtropolis, Swagnificent greeted them with his army of overly confident minions wearing sunglasses indoors.  

- **Lego Batman** went first, dramatically flipping his Lego cape. He hurled *explosive Lego bricks* at the minions, shouting, ‚ÄúEverything is NOT awesome for you!‚Äù  
- **Chicken Little** hacked into Swagnificent‚Äôs swag servers, causing all the minions‚Äô shades to blast embarrassing karaoke videos of themselves. ‚ÄúHa! I knew my coding skills would save the day!‚Äù  
- **Mbapp√©** juggled soccer balls, using his insane footwork to kick them at the minions, sending them flying into orbit. ‚ÄúGolden Boot, meet golden defeat!‚Äù  
- **Eugene** just stood there, arms crossed. His dreadlocks seemed to move on their own, slapping enemies left and right. When Swagnificent himself approached, Eugene simply said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing too much, my guy,‚Äù and handed him a mirror. Overwhelmed by self-doubt, Swagnificent dropped the Rizz Crystal and fled.  

---

### **The Aftermath**
The Handsome Heroes saved the day and restored the Rizz Crystal to its rightful place, ensuring everyone in the universe could be unapologetically attractive again. The citizens of Swagtropolis threw a massive party.  

- Lego Batman brooded in the corner but secretly enjoyed the snacks.  
- Chicken Little lectured a crowd on the science of swag.  
- Mbapp√© showed off his freestyle soccer tricks, becoming the life of the party.  
- Eugene chilled on a cosmic couch, saying, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall can hype me up if you want, but no pressure.‚Äù  

The Handsome Heroes departed, each returning to their uniquely absurd lives, knowing they‚Äôd always have the universe simping for them.

### **Kent**  
The ""Garden of England,"" but honestly, it‚Äôs more like the unkempt backyard. Full of hop fields and people hopping to France to escape the reality of living there.

Beautiful beaches, but can you stop trying to secede every other week? And let‚Äôs not even get started on the pasty wars. It‚Äôs a *snack*, not a national treasure.

Newcastle‚Äôs nightlife is legendary‚Äîprobably because it helps you forget the rest of the county exists.

### **Durham**  
The cathedral is nice, but after that? It‚Äôs just endless student housing and a river nobody cares about.

### **Teesside (Technically not a county, but let‚Äôs go with it)**  
You‚Äôve got industry! And‚Ä¶ well, that‚Äôs about it. Middlesbrough isn‚Äôt so much a town as a reason to leave.

### **East Riding of Yorkshire**  
A Yorkshire offshoot that nobody asked for. Hull is your capital‚Äîenough said.

### **Isle of Wight**  
Like a retirement home broke off and floated out to sea. Your big attraction is ""being near the mainland.""

### **Merseyside**  
Liverpool‚Äôs cool, but the rest? Mostly just people wondering how they ended up stuck behind a ferry queue.

### **Berkshire**  
""Royal County""‚Äîsure, if you count Windsor Castle. The rest is just Reading pretending it‚Äôs a city.

The city where optimism goes to hibernate. You‚Äôve got all the charm of a rust belt city that's trying to reinvent itself ‚Äî but often gets lost in its own attempts at reinvention. It's a place where the lakefront is more famous for its ""pleasant"" *smell* than its scenic beauty. Let‚Äôs take a stroll through what Cleveland could use to get out of its long-standing identity crisis.

# 1. Cleveland Browns: The Undefeated Champions of Mediocrity

The Browns' consistent inability to win a Super Bowl is as much a Cleveland tradition as rain and potholes. They've mastered the art of *not* winning. But Cleveland doesn‚Äôt just need a new stadium; it needs an entirely new culture. Here's a thought: Maybe replace the Browns with a team that's *already* winning somewhere else. Or, if you keep them, put them on the same rehab program you put your other struggling industries on‚Äîjust throw everything at it and hope for the best.

# 2. Public Transportation: A Game of Guess Where It Goes

The public transit system in Cleveland is a joke, but not the funny kind. The buses are slow, the trains are few, and even if you‚Äôre lucky enough to get a ride, it's more likely that the vehicle‚Äôs charm is the fact that it‚Äôs ""vintage"" than it is actually functional. Cleveland should take a page out of cities that aren‚Äôt still using transit technology from the 1980s. Why not a few more lines that connect neighborhoods, and just *maybe* make the bus system actually reliable? Public transportation should be about convenience, not a test of patience.

# 3. The City‚Äôs Aesthetic: ‚ÄúMid-Century Blight‚Äù

Cleveland‚Äôs skyline looks like a visual metaphor for its economy. At least you could say it's ""charmingly industrial,"" but let's face it, the lack of aesthetic ambition leaves much to be desired. Instead of gentrifying just the edge of downtown with a few trendy bars and coffee shops, Cleveland could take a hard look at fixing up the places in between‚Äîthere‚Äôs a lot of forgotten corners here that could really shine with some TLC, and maybe a little more green space and modern architecture.

# 4. Economic Development: From Steel to What?

Remember when Cleveland was the heart of America‚Äôs steel industry? Now it's known for...what exactly? Sure, there are some tech startups in the area, but you could argue it‚Äôs like putting a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. The city needs to seriously reconsider its economy and try to build something that isn‚Äôt just based on nostalgia for its industrial past. That means investing in more sustainable, diverse industries and making sure that people who live in Cleveland don't just work in Cleveland but *thrive* there.

# 5. Crime and Safety: Not Just the Statistics, but the Vibe

Cleveland‚Äôs crime rate is more legendary than its sports teams. It‚Äôs not just about the raw numbers; it‚Äôs about the tension that fills the air in some areas. If Cleveland wants to be a vibrant place, it needs to tackle crime head-on. It‚Äôs not all about adding more cops‚Äîit‚Äôs about creating communities that people want to stay in, through better opportunities and safer neighborhoods. You can‚Äôt expect a city to thrive when people are afraid to walk down the street after dark.

# 6. Winter Weather: A Year-Round Slogan

Cleveland's weather is the city's version of the Cleveland Browns: you *know* it‚Äôs coming, and you dread it. The long, dark winters with too much snow and not enough sunshine would test anyone's will to live. Why not use that to your advantage? Turn those long winters into a legitimate part of the city‚Äôs identity. Think year-round events, ice sculptures, and more heated patios. Make the best of it! But seriously, improve public infrastructure to handle the winter better. More shovels, fewer slippery sidewalks.

# Improvements Cleveland Could Make:

1. **Expand the arts and culture scene** to make it a more vibrant, engaging place to live. Right now, Cleveland is a bit of a hidden gem, but it could be so much more if there was a stronger push to make the arts scene more inclusive and accessible.
2. **Revitalize neighborhoods** outside of the ""nice"" parts of town. The effort to make certain areas look good should extend throughout the city, not just areas that are prime real estate for gentrification.
3. **Embrace tech and green industries**. Take advantage of the digital economy, clean energy, and sustainable development. Get more involved with tech startups and green infrastructure‚Äîmaybe get Cleveland known for being progressive in these areas instead of living in the past.
4. **Invest in public safety and quality of life** in the most marginalized areas. Creating safer streets with a focus on community-based initiatives could make a big difference in making Cleveland feel more alive and welcoming.

In conclusion, Cleveland‚Äôs got a lot going for it: rich history, passionate fans, and a certain underdog charm. But let‚Äôs be honest, it‚Äôs time to stop resting on your reputation and take those extra steps to become a city people actually want to live in. The first step? Accepting that being a ‚Äútough city‚Äù is a tired excuse and not an actual strategy for success.",0,1733582417.0,Cleveland,1,0.2,False

1h8tf9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1h8tf9s/divorce_diaries_the_chapters_they_dont_tell_you/,Divorce Diaries: The Chapters They Don‚Äôt Tell You About,"
They tell you about the paperwork. The signatures, the lawyers, the splitting of everything right down to the knives in the kitchen drawer. But no one tells you about the silence that comes after. No one tells you how heavy a house can feel when it‚Äôs just you rattling around in it.

The chapters they don‚Äôt tell you about are the ones where the hero isn‚Äôt really a hero at all. He‚Äôs just a man who couldn‚Äôt get it right. Couldn‚Äôt hold on to what mattered because he was too busy holding on to himself, his pride, his bad habits.

I wrote those chapters with my own two hands. With every sharp word I threw, every time I let her fall asleep feeling small. I thought love was elastic, that it‚Äôd snap back no matter how far I stretched it. Turns out, it‚Äôs more like glass. You drop it enough times, it shatters, and you‚Äôre left staring at the mess you made, wondering how you were dumb enough to let it slip.

The early chapters were easy. Laughter, late nights, the kind of love that felt too big to fail. But the middle? That‚Äôs where the cracks started. You get tired. Comfortable. You stop showing up for the little things‚Äîthe random compliments, the quiet reassurances, the thank-yous that say, I see you. I still see you.

And by the end? You don‚Äôt even know how you got there. You‚Äôre sitting across a table from her, a stranger wearing a face you used to know, signing away seventeen years with a pen that feels like it weighs a ton.

The chapters they don‚Äôt tell you about are the ones where you stay up nights replaying every mistake like it‚Äôs on a loop. You watch yourself fail her in a hundred ways, small and large, and you realize she wasn‚Äôt asking for the moon, just a man who‚Äôd meet her halfway.

They don‚Äôt tell you about the empty spaces, either. The spots where her laughter used to live, the way she‚Äôd steal the blanket in the middle of the night, the sound of her stirring sugar into her coffee. Those spaces don‚Äôt fill themselves. They just sit there, aching.

But the chapter that cuts the deepest? It‚Äôs not the leaving. It‚Äôs the knowing. Knowing you had something good, something rare, and you let it slip through your fingers because you thought you had time to figure it out.

They don‚Äôt tell you that the hardest part of a divorce isn‚Äôt losing her. It‚Äôs waking up every day and knowing it was all your fault. And still, somehow, learning to carry that truth without letting it crush you.

We've known each other for years, just a little short of 2 decades now. You weren't my first best friend, but I think, and I don't mean for this to sound undermining of our other closest friends, you are the first one I run to the most. 

I've seen you fall in and out of love countless times the same way you've seen me. But this time, it feels different. This time, it feels like an epilogue to a new chapter. The permanence of this impending change scares me. 

Of course I'm happy for you! I've never seen you so in love, it's endearing. Anyone would be lucky to have you, Blue. You're kind, thoughtful, generous with your time, and your humor's not that bad. You love hugs, you love making handmade gifts, you love having even the boring days-- she'll be so lucky if she answers you. 

But there's this sinking feeling that I'll lose you to her, which is silly, right? Friends and romantic partners aren't on the same pedestal, I understand. You will love me and our friends the same, always-- and you will love her as one loves a significant other. These are two different kinds of love. But still, will you really not slowly drift away from us? I've seen it plenty of times before with other friends who had long become distant. 

But I'm learning to be okay with being alone. I know it will have to happen eventually, all of us separating for longer periods of time, what with us going off to start graduate studies, begin working, or starting other chapters of our adult life. 

For what it's worth, I'm so glad you have been part of my life for as long as you have. The Lord placed you in my life at the right moment, and I suppose Him leading you away (for now) is the right timing as well. You are my guardian angel, my sister, and my lavender, Blue. I loveeee you! Wag ka lang masyadong lumayo, ah? Dapat may coffee/ foodtrip dates parin tayo when our schedules sync up once in a blue moon!

I‚Äôm moving to Bangkok for 6 months and trying to figure out where to live. I‚Äôm torn between Park Origin Phrom Phong and Ashton Chula-Silom.  

About me:
  
- I‚Äôm 29,straight, male.  
- I like walking around and exploring (so walkable areas are a big plus).  
- Would love to be close to a shopping mall, coffee shops, and a gym.  

From what I‚Äôve seen online:  

- Phrom Phong seems chill, nice, and full of stuff to do, especially with malls like Emporium/EmQuartier nearby.  
- Chula-Silom looks more central and convenient for getting around, with a mix of modern vibes and local culture.  

Anyone here lived in these areas or has experience with either condo? 

Would love to hear your thoughts‚Äîlike, which one might feel more lively or convenient for daily life? Or if you have more suggestions?

I'm very much struggling with how to feel comfortable/confident with everything I need to transport daily. 
[IDK if it has to do with my ADHD or what, but if things don't look and feel just right for me, I find it difficult to be productive bc I remain focused on how to ""fix"" what isn't working for me. In this case, I am physically very uncomfortable and nothing ive tried has worked exactly how I need it to.] I'm trying to get ahead of this now to set myself up for success.

üéíI started with a traditional backpack. -> did not like it because I can't reach anything while walking, if I stop briefly in the front office and need to reach for something there's the whole process of taking it off your back, etc. It's just not streamlined for easy access. Also possibly not enough space in total. 
‚òÜI tried the traditional laptop bag (black cloth, has the laptop sleeve etc). It was comfortable but it was ugly and didn't leave much space inside for books, files, notebooks? Etc. Def nowhere to throw my coffee or water bottle for easier transport.

üëúI ordered this: https://a.co/d/jaJg96k - I thought well, it's cute and has pockets with more space. I didn't like it either. The straps hurt and aren't great quality.

üí™üèºI bought this large tote bag (photo posted at top of this entry) and it fits everything with some extra space (yay!). And then I realized how crazy heavy it is. It's crazy heavy because I am carrying, probably, too much at once on my shoulder but idk what else do?

1h8tbmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamInterpretation/comments/1h8tbmw/the_creamer_dream/,The Creamer Dream,"The Creamer Dreamer

I am in one of those strange, amorphous mindscapes that I so often encounter while dreaming: a mall or other large commercial location that becomes an entirely different scape with the turning of a corner or egress through a door. Ex: I‚Äôm wandering through a mall, turn a corner, then find that I am in the detached garage at my grandparent‚Äôs summer home in Goshen, NJ.

Anyway, in my dream last night, I found myself in one of the aforementioned and nebulously defined environments. This time, I am standing in the back of a church basement, making myself a cup of coffee. It‚Äôs clear that I am at a 12-Step meeting, with one person up at the front of the room, dressed in casual attire (white t-shirt with a design I either can‚Äôt remember or couldn‚Äôt make out and, I‚Äôm assuming, blue jeans), and telling their story of Experience, Strength, and Hope. Anyone who‚Äôs been to an AA meeting will know exactly what I‚Äôm talking about. They may not even need to read the rest of the description of my environment to envision a location in which the coming events could take place. As is common for my dreams, I hear speech, but can only make sense of phrasal odds & ends‚Äîa word here, half a sentence there. The audience is rapt, hardly daring to blink or breathe for fear of interrupting the vocal spell being cast by the speaker.

I notice that there is an uncommon number of children among the crowd. There are sometimes one or two children, wreaking quiet havoc or playing games on tablets, but in this dream it appears as though as much as fifty percent have their children in tow. This in itself is not particularly alarming, just strange.

The coffee station in the dream AA meeting is no different from the dozens of others I‚Äôve encountered over the past few years. With its large steel electric coffee urn, stack of possibly the smallest Styrofoam cups allowed by Galactic law (roughly half the size of what most adult Americans would consider a normal cup size, and *always* Styrofoam), one of the foam cups filled with granulated sugar set into hard brown clumps as a result of people stirring their coffee with the ubiquitous plastic spoon then placing it immediately back into the sugar, all set atop a faux wood-grain folding table.

As previously mentioned, I am at the described coffee station, making myself a cup of usually surprisingly good coffee. (F.N.: I have theories as to just why it is that AA meetings typically have above subpar coffee, the most logical being that the coffee urns, receiving no more than a cursory rinse at the end of each meeting, have an effect on the flavor, just as the seasoning of a cast iron skillet or wok effects the flavor of the food cooked in it. But I digress. Again.)

I‚Äôve always been a cream and sugar person. That‚Äôs how I experienced coffee for the firt time, and that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve consumed it since, with the exception of a period of just a few weeks in my early thirties when I drank it black for no reason more significant than just wanting to try something differently. In my dream, I fill my cup with coffee, add a spoonful of sugar, then go to add some of the non-dairy creamer that‚Äôs usually available in one of the foam cups right next to the sugar. Only this time, instead of being filled with a reasonable amount of the whitish powder, it is overflowing, sitting in a pile of the stuff. The cup literally runneth over. For reasons I did not at the time, and still don‚Äôt, understand, I find that I am wary of this sight, as one may be wary of a stray dog. There is now not a spoon to be found on or about the table. I look behind the urn, under the table, in my pockets: nothing. But I know that \*simply must\* add creamer to my coffee. I have no choice in the matter. It must absolutely be done. Not adding creamer to this particular cup of coffee has, in the context of the dream, dire/unknown and therefore possibly life-threatening consequences.

Meanwhile, the bits & bobs I‚Äôve been hearing of the speaker‚Äôs story have ceased. A venomous silence has fallen over the room. I turn to investigate, to see what might have prompted this sudden silence, and find that everyone in the church basement is staring at me. Not just the adults; the children are watching, goggle-eyed, as well.A few among the populous whisper to one another while keeping their eyes firmly on me, sopeaking from the corners of their mouths. My anxiety rises several notches.

Although I don‚Äôt typically have Lucid Dreams, I become aware that it‚Äôs entirely possible that I may be in the midst of a classic Naked-in-Public dream, but when I look down, I am fully clothed. All the same, this does nothing to assuage the steadily mounting fear and trepidation building in my mind and heart. At this point, I can only assume that they are watching and waiting for me to/to see if or how I add the creamer to my coffee. Again, my anxiety increases. It hasn‚Äôt yet reached a point of criticality, though I can tell that that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs headed, based on past experience.

I turn back to the table, cup in hand, even though I distinctly remember leaving it on the table before turning to inspect the crowd. This time, there‚Äôs no creamer, non-dairy or otherwise, anywhere in sight. The table is entirely barren, save for a white plastic spoon set parallel to the length of the table. The sight of the empty table is somewhat relieving. It‚Äôs as if I‚Äôve been absolved of my creamer-adding duties by some benign beverage-base deity. (F.N.: I have a memory of being told by my father one summer afternoon in my thirteenth or fourteenth year that I was to learn how to use the lawnmower the following morning. I spent the rest of that afternoon/evening in an anxious daze because, at the time, I had something of a phobia of gas-powered machinery. My relief the following morning when I woke up and saw that we were being hit by torrential rains was such that I can still recall that visceral sense of relief in decent detail. My point here is that I experienced a similar breed of relief upon discovering that the coffee creamer had gone missing that I felt back in ‚Äò99/‚Äô00 when the lawn mowing lesson had been delayed.)

This is where the serious surreality kicks off. Staring at the suddenly barren table, foam cup in hand, I feel a tug at the back of my shirt. I turn and see a little blonde girl in a blue and white checkered Little Debbie‚Ñ¢dress proffering a cardboard pint of Half&Half. Not an eye has wandered from me and my plight. My fear, anxiety, and relief are now melding into an odd pseudo-emotion I am at a complete loss to describe with any accuracy. I turn back to the table, set the cup down on the faux wood surface, twist off the half & half‚Äôs plastic cap, and pour a dollop into the black coffee. I reach for the spoon to stir it up. An angry male voice shouts, ‚Äú\*What the hell was THAT\*?‚Äù

I freeze.

An equally angry female voice then adds, ‚Äú\*Does this guy even know what he‚Äôs doing\*?‚Äù

Stasis intact, I second guess my actions. Did I do that correctly? What did I do wrong here?

More cries of contention arise from the ever watchful crowd, all voicing convictions to the effect that I‚Äôve added the creamer incorrectly and haven‚Äôt the foggiest clue as to what I‚Äôm doing. The amorphous pseudo-emotion transforms quickly into firm, unalloyed terror. I cannot speak, and therefore can‚Äôt counter the crowd‚Äôs arguments or defend myself. I look like an idiot. There‚Äôs no way I look like anything but a complete ineffectual moron. Confused and beginning to feel the cyclonic swirl of anxiety-induced disorientation, I do the only thing that seems to make any sense.I pour more half & half into my cup, an action met by some positive reactions from the crowd. Cries of ‚Äú\*There you go\*,‚Äù and, ‚Äú‚Äù\*Now we‚Äôre talkin‚Äô\*,‚Äù and the like emanate from the crowd like deconstructed atoms from a fissile core. When I stop pouring, the negative comments regarding my creamer-related aptitude resume. There is no no more than a quarter-inch of room left in the cup. If I add much more half & half, I won‚Äôt be able to pick up the cup without spilling it, but still the catcalling and ridicule come. The crowd begins to chant (F.N.: One thing I learned from this dream is that hearing large groups of people chanting, whether directed at me or not, prompts a serious phobic reaction in me), but there‚Äôs no uniformity in the act, as is the norm for chanting crowds; it sound as if there are different factions within the group calling out their own individual slogans, equating to a maelstrom of indeterminate vocalizations, none of which sound very encouraging. Or, at least, encouraging of anything that made sense to me. Imagine standing in the middle of a stadium filled with people who hate your guts. Each one of them is equipped with a megaphone and ceaselessly spouting personalized vitriol in unison. That is as accurate an approximation as I can convey without divulging (or \*indulging\*) vast quantities of abstract, nonsensical verbiage.

For some unknown span of characteristically elastic Dream Time, I absorb the barbs, the digs, the slings and arrows; my distressed perplexity mounts ever higher. In an attempt to quell the chaos, I begin pouring more creamer into the cup. Coffee and creamer run over the rim of the cup and onto the tabletop. Instantly, as if some Frankensteinian Lever has been pulled, the chiding ceases and become cheers, encouragement, applause, laughter. The AA attendees are losing their ever-loving minds. \*This\* is what they‚Äôve wanted from me the whole time, what they‚Äôve been waiting and watching for. I pour and pour, periodically looking over my shoulder at the ecstatic crowd. When the cardboard pint is empty, a man departs briefly from the crowd to clap me on the shoulder, congratulate me, and hand me another carton of creamer. I begin pouring this into the cup as well. The coffee has long since departed the cup, washed away by a tsunami of half & half, leaving behind only specter of pallid beige to evidence its one-time existence. The table and floor are now home to puddles of coffee-laced half & half. I empty a second carton, a third, a fifth (there is no fourth carton‚ÄîI go straight from number three to number five) all the while the crowd behind me cheers and shouts fervently in support of my actions. I was born for this, made to do this; generations have passed, awaiting my arrival. I am the Pourer of Creamer, a King by my Own Rite. The cosmos begins to deflate around me. I want to drop the creamer and run, but there is no stopping this foretold event. I must pour the creamer, I must not stop. The universe begins to speed up like a VHS tape on Fast-Forward, faster and faster until all that exists, has existed, or ever will exist becomes one uniform blur of light and life and pain and pleasure.
