And now, suddenly, it’s almost a week since you married the guy your parents pressured you into. We didn’t even break up—you just went ahead and married him.



I had to get home, walking all the way to Cubao, ugly crying, asking my friends for help—the only thought in my head was: why? Why was this happening so suddenly? I traveled from Cubao to Zambales, desperately hoping I would reach you before the wedding. I arrived 12 hours too late—only remnants of the celebration remained. I didn’t want to go home, even when friends and family kept trying to reach me. I didn’t need them. I needed you. I needed answers. I ended up sleeping outside a church, asking Him why—what the hell did I do to deserve this?



I finally went home, bombarded with comforting words. I hated every single one.



You chose to abandon me. Your reason? That I’d move on. But how the hell can I move on, knowing that you love me and that you’re suffering from the choice they pressured you into? Here I am, back at work, trying to distract myself, but oh boy—so this is what it feels like to die inside. I can’t do anything to get you out of that misery.



And yet, despite everything you did to me, despite all the pain you caused, I’m neither angry at you nor do I hate you. I can’t hate you. I love you, J. I always will. I just hope this is all a nightmare, and I want to f\*cking wake up.



P.S. Wrote this with a sabaw brain. I'm on my third cup of coffee, and I’m still out of it, so sorry if my storytelling is messy. Guess I’ll be bonding with NIKI’s music again and again.",2,1741920062.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

1jatnkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/astrologymemes/comments/1jatnkg/the_aries_and_pig_paradox_a_golden_retriever_soul/,The Aries and Pig Paradox: A Golden Retriever Soul in a Godzilla Body,"
I’ve noticed something interesting about my Aries friends (born between March 21 and April 19). After learning more about Eastern astrology, I realized that many of them are also Zodiac Pigs (born in 1983, 1995, 2007, or 2019). What impresses me the most is their distinct “modes” in different situations. Here are some clear examples:

	•	Social Mode: A tail-wagging Golden Retriever (when they’re with friends).
	•	Battle Mode: A fire-breathing Godzilla (when facing enemies).
	•	Everyday Mode: A Husky that just knocked over your coffee and is laughing about it (as seen by strangers).

To outsiders, they seem like born optimists—carefree, energetic, and always ready for action. But when you get closer, you might find them surprisingly grumpy. It’s not that they enjoy conflict; rather, they always seem to be in battle mode, so much so that they don’t even realize when they get hurt. However, deep down, they are extremely sensitive when it comes to their close friends.

For example, one of my friends was secretly upset for two weeks just because I casually mentioned that he could learn a little from my mom while complimenting his cookies.

The Secret Behind Their Grumpiness ⬇️

Temper tantrums ≠ Losing control

They aren’t naturally hot-tempered. Instead, they can sense when conflict is coming and prefer to take the initiative rather than passively waiting for it to happen. This gives them a sense of control. So if you ever think about dumping work on them, be prepared—they’ll probably pick a fight with you before you even finish your sentence.

The Oddly Detailed Memory ⬇️

Aries-Pigs might forget your birthday—especially if you never made a big deal about it. But they will absolutely remember that three years ago, at a random get-together, you mentioned that you don’t like onions.

Do you have a friend like this? Are they an Aries or a Zodiac Pig?

1jat8zo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wisdomteeth/comments/1jat8zo/everythings_fine_despite_me_doing_very_bad_things/,"Everything's fine - despite me doing ""very bad"" things (Age 37)","I wanted to write about my chill experience, hoping it is reassuring for those who are worried about extractions.

For about 10 years my dentists refused to extract my wisdom teeth, although all four of them were partially impacted (without any immediate issues though). I begged to get them removed, just because I wanted to get rid of all of them as soon as possible. My dentists stated that the teeth were fine at that moment, and they would handle it only when there are problems in the future. (Note: I am in Turkey, in case general policy for extractions among dentists is different here.)

Finally at age 37, my lower right wisdom tooth decided to get really naughty; causing big trouble 6 months ago and again last week, even wreaking havoc through my entire mouth. My dentist at last said ""Alright, it is time this one is gone"" and just 15 minutes later, poof it was gone! (Kudos to my awesome dentist for the quick and nice experience.) It was a big one, and it came out with a large ball of abscess tissue attached to it. I got dissolvable stitches too, as the hole is huge.

----

I am pretty much living like normal, not giving a shit, even starting 1 hour after the extraction.

**So, what have I been doing wrong?**

- I started smoking 1 hour after the extraction. I smoke about two packs of cigarettes a day.
- I started drinking alcohol on the second day. The anise in Raki (Turkish drink) actually seemed to help.
- I've been eating like my normal diet, starting from the evening of the extraction: Huge amounts of red meat and liver, 85% chocolate, hard cheese, spicy food, some nuts, chunks of butter with honey.
- I've been drinking a lot of coffee, as normal.
- I did not do much dental care. I only brushed two times in 4 days, nothing else. But I did the light rinsing with salt water a few times everyday.
- I did not take antibiotics.
- I did not rest much.

----

The extraction was at 14:30. After the local anesthesia wore off around 19:00, I had considerable pain until 04:00 at night, along with a huge inflamed tonsil at that side of my neck and some fever. I guess it was due to the size of the extraction; it is significant trauma for the tissues. I normally never feel pain and never use painkillers, but any painkiller then was only having an effect for 1.5 hours. Thankfully, after just those painful 9-10 hours, it all subsided.

Now after 4 days, only the extraction site is still a bit swollen, but much better. Some pain still comes and goes, which is handled with just 200mg Ibuprofen (Advil) every 5-6 hours. It seems just about now the pain is pretty much gone though, as I do not feel the need to take any painkillers.

So, despite having a rather large and troubling extraction at age 37, and doing a bunch of things quite wrong, I had a pretty comfortable experience. Good luck to all others!

Tomorrow I will probably be going out for a long night out.",1,1741918115.0,wisdomteeth,1,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

When pouring hot coffee into a metal thermos bottle and then putting on the lid, it seems like it is cooled down to a greater degree than if hot water were put in the bottle first, to heat up the inner surface, before pouring the hot coffee in.  Is it worth using hot tap water to do this?

Question:  So, how can you determine how much cooler a metal vessel will make a hot liquid when the liquid is poured into it?  Is it worth the energy to heat the vessel first.  For example, assume a 350 ml stainless steel cylindrical vessel (you can set the dimensions), at 20 C.  If you pour 350 ml of 100 C coffee (water) into it, at what temperature do the two equalize and how long does it take?  I assume there is some known coefficient related to heat conduction(?) for the vessel.  If you first fill the vessel with hot tap water (say, 50 C), at what temperature do they equalize and how long does it take?  Is it practical to do this first to bring the vessel's temperature up before adding the coffee so that the coffee stays hot longer?",0,1741917543.0,AskPhysics,6,0.5,False

For a bit of context, I (26M) went on four dates with (23F). All seemed to be going well, she was always saying how she was excited to see me, she’s told people close to her about me and we were intimate on our last date. Last week she messaged me saying that she isn’t ready for a relationship. Which was handled well by both sides with clear communication. So there’s no bad blood whatsoever. 

She said that she’s going through a lot right now with work and she disclosed some health issues and she’s going through lots of tests (heart issue, severity unknown) and basically said it wasn’t the right time for her to date anyone or get into a committed relationship. I listened to her and I thanked her for her honesty, and told her it made me understand her situation so much more. She said she’d still love me to be in her life. Some people may think I’m being a fool but I have no reason not to trust her as she’s been honest so far. 

I’ve always said to her that I want to get to know her better, when we were dating and even now. Even though the news was disappointing it made me realise over the last week that perhaps I wasn’t as ready as I thought for a relationship, so I’m more open to the idea of a friendship than I usually would be. I’ve suggested seeing each other casually from time to time, whether it be grabbing a coffee or grabbing some food. 

She also asked to me last week to never change my ways as my thoughtfulness is what drew her to me in the first place. I promised not to change. 

Sorry for rambling I just wanted to clearly explain everything, I guess I’m just looking for some extra perspectives. I’ve never been faced with a situation like this. Just to clarify also it isn’t my intention to get into a friendship with her just to hope we’ll end up dating, I’d like to be there for her as I care.

Over the last few years I've been open to dating men and have gone out of my way to show interest in guys in both places. When I was in Europe guys gave me more attention organically and were much more receptive to flirting and overall nice. Like I had several guys pay for coffee, give gifts, etc while I also did the same for them.

However, in America I've only ever had bad luck with men. Most guys aren't interested in me at all, even after showcasing my intentions and interests in them, and tend to make fun of me. I've had a lot of American guys comment on my looks (saying I'm fat, nothing much to look at, and make jokes about my appearance) and just overall be terrible people. Additionally, I've always had to put my full effort in for American guys and never have been met half way. I feel like men expect to be pampered in the US based on the guys I've spoken to.

Additionally, I don't think this is really an issue about the types of guys I speak to. I am very social and I tend to have a good mix of different types of guys I speak to. These were just some general trends on the people I have met and spoken to.

I had a knee debridement today. We had tried cortisone shot (or whatever it is) in November, but the mechanical symptoms quickly returned with any exertion and the Baker’s cyst came right back, so we decided on an arthroscopy to clean the cartilage up and also give the doc a better look at what’s going on. I assume the surgery went well with no surprises, but the doc didn’t come talk to me after the surgery. For those reading this to get a better idea of what to expect, I will list it out a timeline below.

0700: Show time at the hospital. Had to fast after 0500. Surgery was scheduled for 1100.
0715: In my room and changed into gowns.  Just starting the waiting game. I was tired from waking up early and no coffee, so staying awake was a challenge, not that I really needed to.
1200: Physical therapist came in and went over exercises to do following the surgery and how to walk up and down steps. No crutches or anything needed because I would be able to put my weight on my leg.
1230: The nurse took me to the anesthesia room in the surgical theatre.
~1300: The anesthesiologist quickly put in the IV and knocked me out. I don’t like the thought of needles and have had a rough time getting IVs before, but this was very smooth and painless.
~1400: I woke up in the recovery room. I feel like I woke up very quickly. I wasn’t groggy or anything. My only complaint was a sore throat from the intubation. 
1400-1600: I ate a chicken salad, rice pudding, two cappuccinos, and drank a bunch of water.
1600ish: I was allowed to leave.  I was given my pain meds (co-dydramol and naproxen) and was told to leave the wrap on my knee for 24 hrs. It just feels like an ace bandage. It doesn’t feel like a compression sleeve or anything, but I don’t know for sure.

Post op at home: I was told that I would be sleepy from the general anesthesia for today and maybe tomorrow.  It is almost 2am now and I am WIDE awake, so no grogginess today for me at all.  My knee doesn’t really hurt at all. I am still trying to respect it and take it easy, but besides the occasional little twinge, I don’t feel anything.

1jastnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/personaltraining/comments/1jastnk/improving_your_client_retention/,Improving your client retention,"How do the first 100 days of your clients look?

Two key numbers define your business success: revenue per member and length of engagement - how much you earn per person on average and how long they stay with you. If your only service offering is personal training, the first number is largely fixed and difficult to manipulate. However, the second one - how long a client remains a recurring, paying member - is almost entirely within your control. And as anyone with a basic understanding of marketing knows, retaining clients is always easier and cheaper than acquiring new ones.

As a former combat unit officer, I operated with detailed planning and structured SOPs. As a gym owner, I progressed through group training, small group, personal training, semi-private, and Individual Design services. These, with my bit of love for marketing and product design, made me notice a major problem among personal trainers: they think they just sell exercise. Or worse, they think they sell ""fitness""- in a vague, undefined way. So, how do we fix this?

Systemize the predictable. This means creating an ideal client journey - a clear, written and visualized roadmap of what happens when someone starts working with you. How do they go with your help from feeling lost and confused to confident and successful? This provides clarity for both you and your clients.

Think through questions like:
- How do they find you?
- What happens in the first contact?
- How do you convert interest into commitment?
- What do you do with them in a session?
- What happens between sessions?
- When do you sit down and have actual conversations with them beyond training?
-How do you make the service more valuable over time?

How does this help?
- It highlights your weak points. If you have no idea what happens at certain stages of a client’s journey, you do not know where to improve. (Remember: your job is to create an ideal structure that adapts to individual needs - don’t fall into the trap of saying, “Everyone is different, so I don’t need a system.”)
- It improves your consultation and sales process. When you have a clear journey with defined milestones, it’s easier to communicate your value. Compare these two sales pitches:
“You’ll lose X lbs of fat and gain Y lbs of muscle.”
versus
“In the first two weeks, you’ll gain confidence in exercise selection of squat and pull. By day 30, you’ll be able to warm up independently. By session 20, you’ll learn 2 more movement patterns: push and bend.”
- It makes sales easier because people see an “end” or a clear “outcome.” If people feel like they’re just paying indefinitely for training sessions, they’ll eventually lose motivation. A structured journey helps them see progress and understand exactly what they’re gaining.
- It helps you boost your services. All successful service providers create raving fans within the first 100 days. If your process is just “schedule, train, be nice, sweat, book next session,” you’re missing something.
- Think about small, simple touches that make the experience more valuable. When they sign up, send them a homework video or a questionnaire - something that immediately adds depth to their experience. After their first month, 8-12 sessions, give them a thank-you card. By session 20-25, schedule a coffee chat - a 20-minute extra conversation about their progress. Tie in educational milestones. When they first warm up alone confidently, give them a handwritten certificate.
- A detailed journey also shows you where to improve immediately. If most clients drop off at a certain point, that’s a clear milestone that needs attention. Instead of blaming retention issues on external factors, analyze where the friction happens and make adjustments (is it your sales? is it after the first package? is it at month 3?).
- It helps you refine pricing and service structures. If you can’t imagine any client making it through the full 100-day journey, your service structure needs a rethink. Maybe you need better renewal options, better package structures, or even a coaching subscription model where clients pay a flat rate for access to your expertise rather than just per session.

In short:
Write out your ideal client journey from lost to success. Draw it out like a roadmap, name key milestones. Analyze what you’re doing at each stage and what’s missing. Look for bottlenecks where clients drop off and improve those areas first - then all the rest. 

If your business model confuses you, it’s likely confusing your clients too.",1,1741916794.0,personaltraining,0,0.67,False

It was almost Halloween. Leafless tree branches swayed in the crisp breeze. The grey overcast sky hinted at yet another day of rain. Yellow-grey cornstalks flitted past and dead leaves scattered as the big, brown Buick carried us down the empty country road.

I looked forward to seeing Granny, even if she would be working most of the time I was staying with her. Grandpa agreed to watch me during the daytime. He received a stipend from a back injury he received in the army. It wasn’t much, but between the monthly check and Granny working it was enough. He always enjoyed the company. He would tell me stories about his time in the army and he knew the funniest jokes I ever heard. When he did his daily chores like cleaning the house, he let me explore the empty fields and small woods near their house. I looked forward to trying to find arrowheads, playing on hay bales, climbing trees… Maybe not that last one.

The only downside to my visit was I had to spend it with my cousin, Kasey. My grandparents became her legal guardians after her mom left. Mom and dad never explained where she went. I always worried she might have gone to jail or ended up like those people on Unsolved Mysteries. I might have felt sorry for Kasey if she didn’t bully me whenever the adults weren’t around.

“We’re only going to be gone three days for this business retreat, so I expect you to behave yourself.” Dad looked at me in the rearview mirror. “I don’t want you in the hospital again.”

“Don’t worry, I’ll be good.”

Mom turned in her seat to face me. “If you’re a good boy, maybe we’ll bring you back a present for good behavior. You’ll make sure he’s good, won’t you Teddy?” She held my stuffed bear and made him nod his head like a puppet. I was old enough to know Teddy wasn’t doing it himself, but I played along.

“Teddy gets a present too, right? For good bear-haviour?”

Mom smiled before turning around. “Of course, sweetie.”

The once smooth, quiet ride suddenly became rough and loud as dad’s car transitioned from pavement to the dirt and gravel leading the rest of the way to my grandparents’ house. Granny would take me on long walks down this stretch of road, and I would look for little round rocks she called “Indian Beads”. I showed some to my first-grade teacher, Mrs. Smith and she told me they were actually fossils from a prehistoric plant.

As we came to a stop at a four-way intersection I noticed the abandoned house on the corner. It was the only neighboring house to my grandparents for miles. Most of the year it was completely hidden from view by the trees and overgrown vines covering the chain link fence. Even now, after many of the leaves had fallen, I couldn’t distinguish much other than the chipping paint and wrap-around porch. A few windows on the upper floor peered over the trees, their screens torn and shutters unsecured.

“Somebody really ought to fix that place up.” Mom said.

“Too late for that,” Dad said. “The roof is caved in. It’s not safe.”

“That’s a shame. It must be over a hundred years old.”

After the fence row to the abandoned house, an empty field came into view. It probably belonged to whoever owned the house, but the only thing that grew in it were clusters of Indiangrass, cattails, and most notably, a massive oak tree in the center of the field. It was so big two grown-ups couldn’t reach all the way around it. Several of the limbs were low enough I could reach them without any help. I nearly forgot all the fun we had playing in this field when I realized my grandparents’ house was coming into view.

Grandpa was smoking a cigarette on the front porch as we pulled up. He was jolted from some reverie as Maggie, the black lab shot up and barked, wagging her tail. The car wasn’t even parked before I bolted out the door.

“Grandpa!” I ran to hug him. I nearly knocked him over. He laughed as he steadied himself on the porch railing. A tube of grey cinders fell from the tip of his cigarette as he laughed.

“What are they feeding you, Bucko? You get bigger every time I see you.”

I shrugged, and he let out another loud laugh. “You know what? I got some cartoons recorded for you!”

“Really?” We only got local channels at my house. The only cartoons were the ones on PBS, and that was only when they weren’t broadcasting boring home repair shows.

He smiled. “Your grandma left the videotapes next to the TV for you.”

Mom and Dad came up to the porch, Dad with the suitcase, Mom with Teddy. Grandpa bent down to whisper something to me. “I hid something for you under your pillow.”

“Really? What is it?”

“Don’t you spoil the boy, dad,” Mom handed me Teddy.

“Spoil him? It’s Halloween isn’t it Johnny?”

“Uh-Huh!”

“Well, we hate to drop him off and run, but we do need to get going.” My dad looked at his watch. “Johnny, you behave now.”

“I will.”

I hugged my parents goodbye. They waved as they backed out of the driveway and pulled onto the road. The big brown car slowly vanished in a cloud of dust. I picked up my luggage and went inside.

“I’ll be in there in a few minutes,” Grandpa said, settling into the lawn chair and sipping his coffee. “I just want to finish this newspaper article.”

I walked through the living room and saw the VHS tapes just like grandpa said. One of the labels read “Speed Racer”. I couldn’t wait to watch them. When I got to the guest bedroom, I set my suitcase on the floor next to the bunk bed. Kasey always slept in the top bunk which left me on the bottom. I set Teddy down and reached under the pillow. To my surprise there was nothing. Confused, I moved the pillow and found the spot underneath was bare. I looked under the bed thinking maybe whatever Grandpa left for me had fallen on the floor.

“Looking for this?” Kasey was hanging upside down from the top bunk. She dangled a bag of assorted candy while biting off a piece of taffy.

“Hey! Grandpa said that was supposed to be for me!”

“Not anymore.” She chomped the sticky mess in her mouth between words. A few tootsie rolls fell out of the bag as she rummaged for something else.

“Oh, you can have those.” She grimaced. “I don’t like those anyway.”

I picked up the pieces of candy from the floor and put them on the bottom bunk.

“They’re better than nothing,” I thought, as I set Teddy on top of the pillow.

“Why couldn’t you just go with your parents?” Kasey was scowling, still upside down.

“They’re going on a business trip,” I said. “Kids aren’t allowed.”

“Whatever,” Kasey said, disappearing over the edge of the bed. I wondered if Kasey was going to be this way the entirety of my stay. No, she couldn’t be. Not with the grown-ups around. Even when they weren’t she could be alright sometimes. Maggie’s barking from the porch interrupted the thought. From the window next to the bunk bed, I saw Granny’s car pulling up the driveway and into the lean-to carport behind the house. I ran through the kitchen and out the back door to meet her. Kasey shoved me aside as she rushed past me into the carport.

“Granny, Granny! You’ll never guess what I did at school today!”

“I’m sure it was wonderful sweetheart.” Granny fumbled an unlit cigarette to her lips.

“Hi, Granny!”

“Well, hi there, Johnny!” Granny hugged me. “Are you hungry for some cheeseburgers?”

“You make the best cheeseburgers in the world, Granny.” She smiled as I said this and slammed the back door shut behind us. It was an old door, possibly part of the house’s original construction. The latch didn’t work most of the time, and there was about an inch between the bottom of the door and the threshold. I remembered how scared I was last summer when I spent the night. I could see coyotes’ feet under the door as they walked through the carport. Occasionally, one would bump the door and it would open slightly, only to be stopped by the chain holding it shut. It was terrifying to see one of the wild dogs’ muzzles through the small gap as they howled.

“Damn this old door.” Granny slammed it again two more times before kicking a wooden wedge under it to keep it shut. The chain jangled as she fastened it shut. Turning around, I could see her look of exhaustion give way to anger as she looked over the messy kitchen.

“Daniel Lee!” Grandpa hurried to his feet and ambled inside, the screen door slamming behind him.

“Why didn’t you do anything while I was gone today? This place is a wreck!”

“I did plenty while you were gone, woman!”

“Oh, like the dishes?” She gestured to the overflowing sink of dirty cups and plates.

“I had to pace myself, so I took out the trash, emptied the ash-trays, checked the mail, made some coffee…”

“And then sat around listening to music and watching the weather channel.”

“Don’t be mad Granny,” I said. “He has a bad back.”

“I know sweetie.” Granny sighed. “Why don’t you and Kasey go outside and play?”

After dinner, Granny took us to the field with the oak tree. Kasey and I used sticks we found like swords, slashing through the occasional cluster of tall grass. You couldn’t tell from the road, but trash littered the field, smashed beer cans, worn-out clothes, and who knew what else. Kasey and I prodded at a large black bag, ripping at the seams.

“Stay out of that, kids! You don’t know where it came from or what it is,” Granny said as she lit another cigarette.

Kasey and I bolted off ahead, “fighting” other imaginary pirates until we came to the oak tree. We ran around it, played tag under it, and swung from the low-hanging branches. Kasey even helped me reach some stray acorns from a branch I couldn’t reach. I was a bit nervous, climbing. When I broke my arm last summer, Kasey and I were trying to get her kite out of the spruce tree in the front yard. This felt eerily similar, but I got down with no trouble. We divided the acorns between ourselves and pretended they were doubloons. Kasey could be alright, at times like this. Neither of us had siblings and it was fun having someone to play with. I had to admit, even if she was terrible sometimes, Kasey could still be a lot of fun.

“Eww,” Kasey said pointing between a couple of the tree’s exposed roots. “What’s that?”

“What is it Kasey?” Granny looked down from the clouds she was looking at.

“It’s moving,” Kasey said, pointing.

A clump of ladybugs the size of a football crawled around and over top of each other. I couldn’t believe we missed it when we were playing our game of tag. I had no idea why these ladybugs were doing this. I wondered if Mrs. Smith would know. She knew about lots of things.

“They must be huddling together to stay warm,” Granny said. She turned her head upward to the darkening sky as thunder rumbled in the distance.

“Come on, you two. It sounds like rain is on the way.”

“Aww, Granny! Can’t we stay a little longer? We’re still trying to find the X where the treasure is.” Kasey pouted as she said this.

“Kasey,” Granny said with a stern look on her face.

“Come on, Johnny! Let’s race back to the house.”

“O.K.” I ran as fast as I could after her, but it was no use. Kasey was taller than me and a faster runner. I could barely see her magenta jacket between the sporadic growths of grass and the odd bush. Finally, she was out of sight. I gave up and tried to catch my breath. The distant rumble of thunder became louder as I walked the rest of the way back to the house.

Granny made us take baths before we went to the living room to watch TV. I forgot to pack my pajamas, so Granny gave me one of Kasey’s old ones to wear. They were red flannel with a zipper and built-in feet. Ky’s pajamas were almost identical, just bigger. Granny thought us wearing matching outfits would make a great picture. She snapped one of us on the couch with her polaroid. Granny had to get up early, so she couldn’t stay up with us long.

“Don’t stay up too late.” She said, hugging us goodnight. Kasey got up and left the room. I decided to get one of the VHS tapes ready. I checked the cartoon channels, but nothing good seemed to be on. I just started the “Speed Racer” tape when Kasey plopped down on the couch with a bowl of popcorn. I reached for a handful when she jerked the bowl out of my reach.

“Don’t wipe your hands on my pajamas.” She gestured to my borrowed outfit.

“I wasn’t going to.”

“Good. Because they’re mine.” I could already hear my grandparents snoring in the small house. I tried to enjoy the cartoon, despite realizing Kasey now had free reign to torment me as much as she liked. She made fun of how the people’s lips didn’t match what they were saying. She mocked the characters and made me wish I had just gone to bed. Between her comments and the howling wind outside I could barely focus. We only finished one episode when I decided to go to bed. I could always take the tapes home and enjoy them there.

“At least she won’t be able to bother me while I sleep,” I thought.

I was wrong. The overcast, rumbling skies from earlier had given way to a thunderstorm. Lightning flashed against the skeletal tree branches out the window and I held Teddy tight. Kasey’s long black hair hung from her upside-down head as she peered down from the top bunk. Her pale face looked at me in the dark.

“I bet you don’t know about the witch that lives in those woods.” She pointed at the woods behind the house.

“There aren’t any witches around here.”

“Are so! Kathy Connors showed me a book all about them at school.”

“Goosebumps are just made-up stories.”

“It wasn’t a Goosebumps book, stupid. It was about a town nearby with a bunch of witches. They were caught casting spells and making sacrifices in the woods. The townspeople found them after hearing the cries of children they were killing.”

I didn’t say anything. I just shuddered at the thought.

“Then,” Kasey continued, “a bunch of angry villagers chased them through the woods until they caught and executed every witch but one. She escaped and was seen flying on her broomstick in the night sky. She hovered over the gallows and said she would avenge the death of the other witches in her coven.”

“Stop making things up. None of that’s true.” I shuddered.

“It is true. It was in that book. It said bad things happened to the people who tried capturing her. Their crops didn’t grow, their animals died, their children vanished without a trace. They never found her, and she still haunts the woods to this very day.”

I held Teddy tight as thunder clapped and wind raged outside. I couldn’t wait for this visit to my grandparents to end.

Birds scattered from behind a bush as we ran through the empty field. The thunderstorm of the previous evening had given way to a crisp, foggy morning. We found stick swords and decided to pick up our game of pirates from the night before. Once we got through the overgrown fence row, however, our attention was immediately diverted to the oak tree. It had fallen. We looked at each other before throwing down our sticks and running to see what happened. Granny told us the tree was over 200 years old, I couldn’t believe it collapsed. I gasped for air as I tried keeping up with Kasey. Without the tree sticking up in the center of the field, I realized how easily I could get lost. Most of the tufts of grass were taller than I was. Besides a few trees in the fence row, nothing else was visible. Kasey was no help. She ran so far ahead I could barely catch a glimpse of her magenta jacked as I rounded a cluster of grass before she would disappear behind the thick fog and foliage.

My lungs burned and my throat was hoarse from breathing the cold air when we both stopped at the terrible sight. The once-great tree lay on the ground, its massive trunk splintered a couple of feet above the ground. Most of the branches were crushed or broken off as they fell. Kasey and I looked at each other before getting closer. The cluster of ladybugs was nowhere to be found. The limbs I swung from just yesterday lie shattered beneath the weight of the wrecked tree. Worse still, inside the jagged stump, I could see the wood in the center was dead. Frowning, I grabbed a handful of waterlogged, decomposing wood. Only the outer few inches of the tree beneath the bark was actually alive. I realized it was probably on the verge of collapse since I first saw it.

“You see,” Kasey said, as I wiped the rotten wood from my hands. “It’s the witch.”

Kasey jumped up on the collapsed tree trunk and walked its length like a balance beam. “She’s still haunting those woods. All these years later, she’s still making bad things happen.”

I felt a chill, but couldn’t tell if it came from Kasey’s story or the strong breeze which seemed to come from nowhere.

“A witch couldn’t have done this,” I said. “She’d be a hundred years old by now.”

“Doesn’t matter,” Kasey jumped from the trunk. “Witches live hundreds of years on the blood of children just like us.”

I desperately wanted this to be false. I tried to think of a way to prove Kasey was lying.

“The witch couldn’t live all year in the woods. What about winter? She would have frozen to death.”

“That’s why she killed the farmer who used to plant this field. Why don’t you think anyone lives in the house at the crossroads?” Kasey gestured to the derelict house at the opposite end of the field. A window from the house’s turret peeked ominously through empty tree branches and rising fog.

“My dad said nobody lives there because it isn’t safe. He said the roof is caving in.”

“Has he ever been there before?” Kasey wore a terrible smirk on her face.

“I don’t…”

“Of course, he hasn’t! Because he knew the witch was living inside.” The wind was picking up again and I felt cold standing next to the old oak tree.

“I’ll bet none of the grown-ups have gone to that house. They’re probably all scared, just like you.”

“Am not!” I felt my brow furrowing.

“Scaredy cat! Scaredy cat! Scaredy cat!”

“I am not.”

“Then come with me.”

“Where?”

“To the witch’s house stupid.” Before I could say anything, Kasey took off through the fog. Her bright jacket almost completely vanished before I tried catching up with her. I didn’t want to go to the house, but I definitely didn’t want to stay by myself in the fog. At this point, I had no idea where Kasey was. I just knew the direction she went. The occasional crow erupted from a hiding place around the clumps of grass as I struggled to keep up. Their loud caws were the only sound I could hear besides the squishing of wet grass and my strained breathing as I ran. The fog seemed to thicken at the far end of the field. In some places, I couldn’t see more than a few feet ahead of me.

I finally reached the tree line before the house’s yard when I saw Kasey’s magenta jacket. She was moving slowly toward the back porch of the house. I ran the short distance to catch up with her. She must have heard my footsteps because she turned to face me with a finger to her lips. She gestured for me to come closer.

“Somebody is inside,” She whispered.

“Stop telling lies.” I shuddered at the thought. I felt exposed in the relatively empty, albeit overgrown yard.

“I’m telling the truth.” Kasey’s eyes were wide. “I saw a shadow move behind the upstairs window.”

I looked at the dilapidated house and realized it was in even worse shape than I thought. Wooden siding hung loosely from the sides of the house. Several of the windows were shattered. Vines from some wild plant grew through the collapsed portion of the roof. The porch was riddled with termite holes. The door on the back porch stood halfway open, giving us a view of the hallway. Wallpaper hung, peeling from chalky plaster. The wooden floor was covered with moss, scraps of paper, and broken ceiling tiles. The staircase had several broken steps. We stopped in our tracks at bottom of the porch steps.

“Come on aren’t you going to come inside?” Kasey looked much less sure of herself.

“Nobody could live in this place. Not even a witch.”

“So, you say.”

Kasey took the first step onto the porch. I followed close behind, keeping a watchful eye to the trees around the house. I felt like we weren’t alone as we advanced on the back door. I tried thinking of some way to get Kasey to leave this place as the porch creaked under our combined weight. We avoided the broken boards until we were at the threshold of the ruined house. With an uncertain foot, Kasey stepped into the house. Stray pieces of glass crunched underfoot as I followed on the filthy carpet. I looked through a doorframe to my right and could see light streaming in from the holes in the roof. The vines I saw outside disappeared into a large sink filled with decaying leaves and blackened water. Debris under my feet made more noise as I walked into the tiled floor of what I now recognized as a kitchen. The plaster from the walls left coarse white dust over most of the counters and floors. I was about to turn and find Kasey when I stopped in my tracks. There was a muddy footprint on the floor. I looked down at the wet mud around its edges and felt suddenly sick. It was at least twice the size of my own foot. I followed the muddy outlines and realized they went up the stairs.

My eyes followed the stairs up to the landing and fixed themselves on a weathered door on the top step. A door creaking echoed through the house. It came from upstairs. Kasey ran past me in the hallway and out the back door. I heard noises like a cat hissing loudly as I bolted from the kitchen after Kasey. I felt my world spin as I slipped on some of the trash and hit the wooden hallway floor with a loud thump. I gasped and clutched my chest as I felt the wind knocked out of my lungs. Large clumps of plaster ground loudly against the wood and forgotten leaves of paper crumbled as I scrambled out the front door. A door somewhere in the house slammed as I jumped from the porch. Kasey was standing at the fencerow waving for me to run. Her eyes looked back in horror. I turned to see a shadowy figure behind the curtain at the top of the turret move.

We avoided the field the rest of the day. We didn’t even leave the house, we just stayed on the couch and away from the windows until bedtime. That night, Kasey left her blanket hanging over the edge of the top bunk to cover the window looking into our room, and got into the bottom bunk with me.

“I’ll bet the witch saw us,” Kasey said.

“Maybe she didn’t.” I knew how foolhardy the suggestion was before I said it.

“Didn’t you see her moving behind the upstairs curtain? She had to have seen us.”

“Then why didn’t she come after us? Surely she wouldn’t let us get away.”

Kasey thought for a minute. I could hear the flap, slap, flapping of the worn-out screen door in the carport. I reassured myself. I checked the back door before I came to bed. The chain was in place. Nobody could open the door from the outside, not even with a key.

“Maybe the witch only comes out at night. Like a vampire.”

“Maybe.” I lay there holding Teddy tight. That morning I hadn’t believed anything about witches. Now I was having a serious conversation about the possibility one could be just across the barren field next to my grandparents’ house.

“What are we going to do?”

“I don’t know.”

The wind billowed past the window near the bunk bed. I cringed as a low branch scraped against the glass. “I’ll ignore it,” I thought to myself. I wasn’t about to let a little wind bother me, not when I had a real problem.

That’s when I heard the doorknob to the back door rattle. I could hear the loud thumps as something slammed into the back door. We screamed in our beds as the chain rattled with each attempt to shove the door open. Maggie, the black lab barked and started growling at the back door.

“Someone is trying to get in!” Tears ran down Kasey’s face. I could hear the mattress in my grandparents’ room groan as they got out of bed. With speed I wasn’t used to seeing, Grandpa rushed past the open door to the guest room with his shotgun. The glow of the floodlights in the carport shined through the blanket covering our window. Granny ran into our room and tried her best to comfort us.

“Shhhh. It’s alright,” She said, hugging us. “It’s just coyotes.” In all the commotion, the blanket fell from the window. Now the once familiar yard and fence row looked menacing in the blueish light.

“Granny it’s not coyotes. The witch is trying to get in!” Kasey cried again.

“That old wives’ tale? Sweetie, there’s nothing out there but those wild dogs. Grandpa is locking the door, don’t you worry.”

“By lock, she means shoving the wooden wedge under the bottom to keep it closed,” I thought as I looked outside. I stared into the darkened tree line and field beyond. It was impossible to tell if anything was out there, but my eyes kept playing tricks on me. Shoots of grass looked like a crouching witch. Empty tree branches looked like emaciated hands. Every rustling leaf and swaying tree left me more uncertain about whether something lurked just beyond the reach of the floodlights outside.

We gathered enough courage to venture outside the next day. The blue spruce swayed in the breeze. I could still see the yellow splinters where I broke a branch off trying to get my cousin’s kite last summer. I remembered her telling me to go out on the limb alone because it was too small for us both.

“We need to come up with a plan for what to do about the witch,” Kasey said as she climbed on top of the platform of the old well.

“Grandpa said not to play up there! The platform isn’t safe to stand on!”

Kasey grabbed the long pump handle on the well and rocked on the balls of her feet. It creaked as she pumped rusty water from the spout.

“But… Granny said it was just coyotes.”

“She just wanted to keep us from getting scared. Would you want two little kids to know a witch was trying to get into the house?”

I shook my head. “No.”

“Exactly. She probably had no idea how to get rid of a witch in the first place.”

I looked up at Kasey. “Do you?”

“Um,” Kasey looked down as she jumped from the platform. “Salt! That’s it. Witches can’t cross a trail of salt.”

“How do you know that?”

“My cousin Jeremy told me so. He’s the one who let me borrow the book about witches.”

“I thought you said Kathy Co…”

Kasey looked angry. “Shut up. I told you I read it didn’t I?”

“Yes.” I looked down at my feet. “But how are we going to put salt all the way around the house? We’d need a huge bag!”

“Not if we just do the doors and windows. Here’s what we’ll do: We can wait till Grandpa and Granny are asleep. Then, we’ll get into the cupboard and get their can of salt. Then We can spread the salt. It’s that easy!”

“But what if the witch gets us while we’re outside?”

“She won’t get us. Not if we finish before the witching hour.”

“The what?”

“Midnight? That’s when witches come out.”

Suddenly grandpa appeared on the porch. “Kids… Lunch is ready.”

Kasey and I trudged through the yard and back to the house. Climbing the steps to the house, I noticed something odd: the radio was off. Grandpa might have turned down the volume during the day while he watched the weather forecast and local news, but he almost always kept it on till Granny got home. The TV was also off as we walked through the living room. If felt wrong for there not to be some ambient noise in the house. I pulled up a chair at the kitchen table and started crushing crackers into my chicken noodle soup. Grandpa was quiet as he sat down to eat. His usual, laid-back demeanor was replaced with alert eyes and silence. He was wearing the olive drab jacket from his army days and I could see brass and waxed paper cylinders in his pocket. I realized they were shotgun shells. Kasey and I looked at each other as we ate our soup. I wondered if she noticed this when the police scanner screeched to life in the living room. Grandpa got up and turned the volume down after the dispatcher said something about a suspect being “at large”. I wondered what that meant.

“Why aren’t you listening to music grandpa?”

He made a small smile. “I have a bit of a headache. It’ll go away with a little quiet.”

We finished eating and Grandpa asked us to stay inside while he made a phone call. I thought it was unusual for him to take the call outside, but he said we could watch TV while he was talking. He spoke in hushed tones as he paced the porch, occasionally looking over his shoulder. I wondered what had him acting this way as I turned on the TV. Grandpa left it on the news and there was a hand-drawn picture of a man with long, scraggly hair and strange-looking eyes. I didn’t give it much thought before changing to a cartoon channel. Scooby-Doo was on and I always loved watching them solve mysteries. I hoped another episode would be on next because Fred was pulling a mask off a supposed “wolf-man”. It was always just a man in a mask. There were no real monsters, no matter how real they seemed.

Kasey plopped down on the couch. “Just checked. There’s plenty of salt in the cupboard.”

“Why can’t we put the salt out now? In the daytime?”

“Do you remember how mad Granny was when you used all her spices on ‘Experiments’ that one time? Besides, Granny might see the salt and try to clean it up.” I felt embarrassed thinking back to the time I dumped the whole spice cupboard into a mixing bowl. I thought I was doing a chemistry experiment, but in reality, I was just making a mess of nutmeg, cinnamon, and garlic powder.

“Are you sure it’s safe?”

“Of course. I read that book. I even did a show-and-tell about it.” We were interrupted by the rattling of the screen door.

“Well, Johnny,” Grandpa said. “Your parents are coming back a day early. The retreat ended, so they’ll be here late tonight or early in the morning to pick you up. They’re on the way to the airport right now.” He ruffled my hair as he walked through the living room, lighting another cigarette.

“Your Granny is coming home early from work today too. Maybe we’ll have some more cheeseburgers for supper.”

Grandpa smiled as he said these things, but I could tell something was off. Kasey and I kept watching TV until Granny got home. Even with her back, the house was quiet. She didn’t get onto Grandpa for not doing the dishes or cleaning up around the house. My grandparents stayed barely even spoke, except for a few whispered words. My parents called while I was in the bath to let my grandparents know they were on the way, but it would be a few hours before they showed up.

“We’re going to head to bed,” Granny said as she rubbed her eyes. “Johnny, your parents are going to be here late tonight.” She glanced at the clock. “You and Kasey can watch cartoons until they get here, just promise me you’ll wake me up when they get here. OK?”

“OK, Granny,” I said giving her hugs before Kasey and I settled back onto the couch.

“One more thing,” Granny said from behind her bedroom door. “Keep the doors locked.”

I thought this a weird request, but Ky and I both agreed. Granny went to bed. I looked at the clock near the TV. It was almost 11 o’clock. I wondered if I could get out of Kasey’s crazy idea. It didn’t take long before I could hear my grandparents snoring in their room. I pretended to be interested in the movie on TV. It was a kids’ movie about witches trying to capture a small girl about my age. She had a big brother who was trying to keep her safe. “I wished my cousin was more like him,” I thought as I watched Kasey disappear into the kitchen. I thought she was making popcorn until I hear the faint sound of a chair dragging across the floor to the cupboards. I thought about what she was doing when the movie suddenly had my full attention. One of the kids in this movie shook salt all around her just as the witches were closing in on her. Kasey hadn’t read about salt keeping witches away. She must have watched this movie and assumed I had never seen it. I felt betrayed. The same feeling I had as the branch of the spruce tree cracked under my weight while I tried to get Kasey’s kite. This was just another one of Kasey’s tricks.

She returned to the living room with a can picturing a girl holding an umbrella.

“Here, you take this.” She held out the salt shaker from the table. “Now, it’s simple. We go out the front door I’ll go around the left side, you go around the right side, then…”

“No,” I said. Kasey looked taken aback. I think it was one of the few times I ever confronted her.

“What?”

“I’m not going to that side of the house. It’s closest to the empty field where the witch’s house is.”

“Yes, you will.”

“If you try to make me go to the right side of the house, I’ll wake up Granny and tell her what you’re up to.” Kasey’s lip quivered with frustration.

“F-Fine,” she said. “You take the left side since you’re such a fraidy-cat. You cover the windows on your side of the house, and I’ll cover mine.” She threw the salt shaker at me and waited next to the door. I looked at the clock before I joined her. We still had almost an hour I thought, although I was considerably less confident in this solution. I realized Kasey was just trying to use me again. As I put my sneakers on, I had an idea. Why not simply act like I was putting salt around the windows until she was out of sight, and then sneak back inside. The door to the carport had that large gap under it. I could spread salt under it from inside the house.

The front door of the house opened silently and Kasey gingerly closed the screen door after us. “Meet back here,” she said. I nodded as I climbed down the left side of the porch and salted around the window on the front of the house. The cold night air made my breath fog up as I kept an eye on Kasey. She already finished her window and disappeared around the corner of the house. Once I was sure she wasn’t coming back, I tip-toed up the porch and carefully slipped inside the screen door. I kicked off my shoes and walked to the back door to spread the salt onto the threshold. I felt somewhat proud for standing up to Kasey. I tried to think of another time I had done this but couldn’t.

The shaker was almost empty as I took the top off. I knelt to the ground to pour the last of my salt along the threshold. The white salt shone in the light of the clear night. I admired the job I had done, even if I thought it wasn’t effective, and I knew Granny wouldn’t be happy when she found it in the morning. I was about to stand up when I froze. Beneath the door were two muddy boots. I was so shocked I didn’t say anything until the door creaked open slightly and I saw the sharp blade of a knife hook into the links of the chain holding the door closed. I yelled for my grandpa as I realized what was happening.

I scrambled away from the door and under the kitchen table as I heard grandpa jump out of bed. Through the crack of the door, I could make out vague features of the man outside as he shook the door violently, trying to get in. With the long hair, the thin face, the wild, deranged eyes I realized it was the man on the news station. Grandpa ran into the kitchen with nothing but his boxers and the shotgun.

“Get the hell out!” He pumped the shotgun and the arm with the knife disappeared through the battered door. Grandpa knelt down. “What happened? Are you hurt? Where’s Kasey?”

We heard Kasey’s high-pitched scream. From the kitchen floor, I could see through the window in the guest bedroom. The crazed man had run into Kasey trying to get away and grabbed her. Grandpa ran out the back door with the shotgun after them, but he couldn’t move fast enough, not with his bad back. The last I saw of my cousin was her pale face screaming in horror and outstretched hand reaching for grandpa as she disappeared into the overgrown field of Indiangrass beyond the reach of the floodlights.",1,1741916729.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False

Yes first of all I was very gullible and fell for it. 

I bought a property and my sister told me she wanted to join and that she would pay half and such. (i knew better and fell for it)

  
I put her in the deed. she started having excuses about not having money and such, so now i invested 50k in the property because we were remodeling to open a coffee shop. she spent 10k.

  
Fast forward she told me she would pay and pay and add more money, but that was never the case. so we opened with what 50k that helped remodel. 

  
now she wants to close the coffee shops because she wants nothing to do with it (even if its successful), and is asking to sell the property and she wants half of the money. when I put 90% of it. i don't think it's fair and that this was her plan all along.

1jasnyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmhocpress/comments/1jasnyk/xelqua_marie_jenin_meeting_13/,Xelqua - Marie- Jenin Meeting (1/3),"“Hi, Xelqua,” said Marie, walking into the meeting room. “You’re early.”

“So are you, Marie,” Xelqua responded warmly. 

“What’s that?” asked Marie, pointing to the camera.

“Polka couldn’t make it today, so we’re recording the meeting for her.”

“Oh, that’s nice,” says Marie, pulling a goofy face at the camera.

“Oh my goodness, you silly head!” Xelqua smiled fondly. “Jenin’s taking the train here, so he’ll join us later on. ICM’s also busy this week. It’s just us two for now.”

“Dang. Even with Parliament closed, everyone’s so busy. Well, we’ve got 15 minutes before the meeting officially starts. Can I tempt you with a coffee or tea?”

“Tea, please. I know a place not far from here.”

A few minutes later, the two of them walk back into the meeting room, beverages in hand, talking animatedly about something inaudible. 

“That’s really interesting,” Xelqua said, sitting down. 

Looking at her watch, Marie saw that it was about time to start the meeting.

“Let’s start. It’s getting rather late, and Jenin called - he’s not getting here until nine, so let’s begin without him,” Marie said. 

“Sounds good,” Xelqua agreed. “What’ve you been up to this week?” 

“A lot. When I say a lot, I mean a lot. Let’s see… I’ve done quite a bit since Parliament closed. I spend a lot less time in my office and more time outside talking to citizens. What about you?”

“Pretty much the same. One woman I talked to brought up hospital wait lines. What do you think?”

“If my memory serves correctly, Ontario has the most hospitals, am I right?”

“Yeah,” nodded Xelqua. 

“Healthcare is more so your domain, but in Canada, we have wait times sometimes reaching 22 hours. That’s… a really, really, really big problem, to put it lightly,” Marie said. 

“Indeed. There are two things I want to talk about in regards to hospital wait lines - well, hospitals in general, I suppose,” Xelqua agreed.

“And they are…?”

“The first is that hospitals all around Canada are facing staffing challenges that need to be solved. The second is that everyone is having trouble properly allocating resources.”

“I know about the first one, but could you tell me about the second?”

“Sure. Now, it is critically important to understand that the term ‘resources’ does not only mean equipment and one-time use items such as ventilators, IVs, and beds. It also includes things like staff, funding, sector capacity, and training. These issues have been a long time coming, with rising stress issues. In that way, I suppose that we should be thankful for the pandemic, as it showed many of the flaws that our healthcare system has under stress.” 

“Oh, darn. That’s a pretty big problem, indeed! What do you propose we do about it?”

“Well, first things first, we can improve things that require little funding and encourage provincial governments to take action. For example, I talked to some of my friends who are in the medical sector, and they all agree that the Patients Before Paperwork incentive is a great way to start. It requires relatively less initial investment compared to other solutions, such as building multiple hospitals from the ground up, and helps reduce or even eliminate the 18.5 million hours spent annually by Canadian doctors across the country on unnecessary paperwork and administrative work.”

“Speaking of healthcare, I want you to look at this brochure I was working on. While chatting with some people in a coffee shop, I noticed that even though there are increasing efforts to raise awareness on social media, there are still many misconceptions about diets. A lot of people frown upon things like calories and carbohydrates when in reality these are incredibly important to consume,” Marie pulled out her computer.

“You’re certainly right. Let me see that brochure.”

The two work quietly and in sync, occasionally murmuring a few remarks. 

“Nice. I’ll send an email to HQ asking them to post these on the website. Thanks, Xel!” Marie said.

“No problem.”

“Oh, look, Jenin’s here,” Marie said, checking a notification on her phone. 

The door opened. 

“WAIT - JENIN WATCH THOSE WIRES!” Marie yelled in a panic.

“AHHH! SINCE WHEN DID WE HAVE WIRES HERE?!”

It gets chaotic and is perfect for me as an extrovert. Now my family is amazing I have a set of twin older sisters (Sophia and Zoe 24 F) and my younger brothers (Jake 19 M and Zach 16M)
We all get along but me and Zach are close. I'm close with everyone else just not as much as me and Zach.  Anyways when we go to family reunions my aunt (Linda 67 F) and her son (Fred 23 M) are awful to everyone. Well except Grandpa of course which is because my grandpa is a rich business owner billionaire (95 M). So when we were at Soph's wedding right when they kissed Fred proposed. At first I thought it was sweet but then I asked Soph when she gave Fred permission and she said she hadn't. So I was pissed cause not only is that awful but Fred's now spouse is a huge jerk to Zach, Jake, Zoe, and me.
Buy she especially hates Zach so when they were scheduling the wedding they put it on Zachs graduation day! Now look that's already important enough but Zach skipped 2 grades and is valedictorian and is going to Princeton full ride.
So when we were all invited (including Zach of course ) he said it was on his grad day but they said they paid the venue already (which isn't even true cause I paid the venue as a wedding gift) so they couldn't reschedule the wedding. So I said no we haven't paid the venue and they both looked at me and flipped me off. So I said I wasn't  attending and most the family came with me to zachs grad. The only person who chose his wedding is Aunt Linda. So the next day he and his stupid wife show up to my door and vandalized my house with spray paint. Now look I know they did this cause I have a ring doorbell cam and it showed them. So I told them to grab coffee with me and I told them I was pressing Charges. Then they told me that I ruined there wedding by telling no one to show up.  So I told them I don't give a clap and then Fred takes his cup of coffee and throws it at me and it shatters. So after that they run and stick me with the bill. So I pay and get some witnesses phone numbers and I went to court for both those things.

Long story short, a guy I’ve known for a couple months through my coffee shop I work at has kind of been my crush for a bit, however he did have a gf for around 5 months. They broke up a couple months ago and he’s single now. I followed him on social media and he followed back immediately. He also added me to his close friend’s list as well. He also has been liking a lot of my stuff I post. I don’t know if I should make a move since he is pretty shy and how I should go about it. Or maybe I shouldn’t because he might get weirded out (I’m kind of scared of rejection). Would it be weird to message him? Give me some advice on this!

Ended a long-term relationship with someone who I really loved deeply, but unfortunately had not managed to work out his mental health/emotional abuse issues throughout our 4-year relationship. We were engaged but I postponed the engagement and then broke things off because he wouldn’t stop his behaviors, try hard enough to change, or seek therapy, no matter how many times I begged him to.

He never hit me or physically abused me but he had a huge anger problem (he has trauma and impulse control issues and grew up with abusive parents) and would yell at me, call me horrific names (swear words, insults, name-calling), dump me, threaten to leave me or end the relationships dozens of times, give me the silent treatment, throw things around the house, kick stuff, punch/slam his fists, break random things, etc. It was really stressful and caused me immense anguish and I asked him so many times to treat me better, he would apologize and be better for awhile until doing it again after a few weeks or months.

I eventually reached my breaking point when his last episode (involving him acting aggressive and screaming/throwing things around the house, but not at me) caused me a nervous breakdown. I was in a fight or fight mode and basically couldn’t function for weeks.

We broke up, but he’s recently been making a big effort to work on his mental health and says he will do anything to change and better himself as a human. He says he recognized the error in his ways, the abuse cycle, how he abused me, and is finally actually doing the things I asked him to do all those years. He is meditating every day, going to therapy, and his overall mood and demeanor seems to be very different. He says that me standing up to him and not taking his BS anymore has given him a massive wake-up call about how destructive his behaviors and mental health have been to him and to everyone around him. He says he wants to change and be a better version of him, not just for me, but for himself. He seems generally less reactive, angry, and explosive. I really love the calm, sweet side of him - the kind, caring side that’s not so tormented by his own trauma and rage. I miss this side, it’s who I fell in love with.

So we are in a limbo state. We broke up, but we are talking, so not exactly together but not fully apart either. I’m considering giving him another chance in a few months or so if I am convinced that he’s actually taking the right steps. I miss and love him dearly but I am still very unsure. We have talked about how I’m unsure, and how neither of us are in a place to go on dates with or sleeping with other people right now.

The thing is, over the past couple of months, about 3-4 men have hit on me/seemed to possibly express some level of interest in me (which hasn’t happened in years; I swear somehow men can sense if you’re not in a committed relationship!). One was an old friend from high school who ran into me, another was at a pizza place, and a coffee shop. I told my high school friend (we chatted for a bit and I couldn’t tell if he was flirting with me) that I’m open to friendship but not emotionally available to date (because of my complicated relationship situation). 

When a random guy around my age struck up a conversation with me at the coffee shop, I was friendly and chatted. I was not flirtatious, just nice and friendly as I would be to anyone talking to me, and had no idea if it was inappropriate of me to be talking with him. We didn’t talk about dating or anything inappropriate, just talked about the area, how there aren’t many people our age here (most people are much older than me and it can get lonely!), jobs, etc. I enjoyed talking with him but also felt so guilty about it. Was I leading him on? Being disloyal to my ex, who I have a complicated relationship with? I didn’t tell him about my complicated relationship status because it didn’t come up and it would have felt very awkward to mention it. He asked for my number to stay in touch and since we were having a friendly chat I gave it to him, as I have to other friends I’ve met (I recently connected with a couple of women and gave them my number too). 

I can’t help but feel like I did something wrong and I feel so confused and icky about all of this. If the coffee shop guy asks me out on a date I’ll just tell him that he seems like a genuinely cool person and I appreciate connecting as friends but I’m ending a complicated long-term relationship and not emotionally available to date right now. Was it wrong for me to talk with him? Should I have ignored him when he was friendly and approached me to say hi? Told him immediately that I have a boyfriend/partner (even tho I don’t)? Should I have refused to give him my number when he asked (I was conflicted but didn’t want to be rude to someone who was friendly)? All the work I do is virtual and I often feel so isolated and lonely these days, it’s nice having people be friendly to me. I would have also been thrilled if a woman my age approached me and gave me her number to stay in touch as friends.

1jasi1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/CSLPlasma/comments/1jasi1a/csl_plasma_promotional_referral_code_for_new/,CSL Plasma: Promotional Referral Code for New Donors! (Get new donor bonus money) Use the CSL Plasma app! Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! I will educate you about plasma. Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jashpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jashpw/my_emotionally_abusive_ex_and_i_broke_up_a_few/,My emotionally abusive ex and I “broke up” a few months ago but it turned into a “break” but we still talk. I feel guilty anytime a man wants to talk with me or shows any interest.,"Ended a long-term relationship with someone who I really loved deeply, but unfortunately had not managed to work out his mental health/emotional abuse issues throughout our 4-year relationship. We were engaged but I postponed the engagement and then broke things off because he wouldn’t stop his behaviors, try hard enough to change, or seek therapy, no matter how many times I begged him to.

He never hit me or physically abused me but he had a huge anger problem (he has trauma and impulse control issues and grew up with abusive parents) and would yell at me, call me horrific names (swear words, insults, name-calling), dump me, threaten to leave me or end the relationships dozens of times, give me the silent treatment, throw things around the house, kick stuff, punch/slam his fists, break random things, etc. It was really stressful and caused me immense anguish and I asked him so many times to treat me better, he would apologize and be better for awhile until doing it again after a few weeks or months.

I eventually reached my breaking point when his last episode (involving him acting aggressive and screaming/throwing things around the house, but not at me) caused me a nervous breakdown. I was in a fight or fight mode and basically couldn’t function for weeks.

We broke up, but he’s recently been making a big effort to work on his mental health and says he will do anything to change and better himself as a human. He says he recognized the error in his ways, the abuse cycle, how he abused me, and is finally actually doing the things I asked him to do all those years. He is meditating every day, going to therapy, and his overall mood and demeanor seems to be very different. He says that me standing up to him and not taking his BS anymore has given him a massive wake-up call about how destructive his behaviors and mental health have been to him and to everyone around him. He says he wants to change and be a better version of him, not just for me, but for himself. He seems generally less reactive, angry, and explosive. I really love the calm, sweet side of him - the kind, caring side that’s not so tormented by his own trauma and rage. I miss this side, it’s who I fell in love with.

So we are in a limbo state. We broke up, but we are talking, so not exactly together but not fully apart either. I’m considering giving him another chance in a few months or so if I am convinced that he’s actually taking the right steps. I miss and love him dearly but I am still very unsure. We have talked about how I’m unsure, and how neither of us are in a place to go on dates with or sleeping with other people right now.

The thing is, over the past couple of months, about 3-4 men have hit on me/seemed to possibly express some level of interest in me (which hasn’t happened in years; I swear somehow men can sense if you’re not in a committed relationship!). One was an old friend from high school who ran into me, another was at a pizza place, and a coffee shop. I told my high school friend (we chatted for a bit and I couldn’t tell if he was flirting with me) that I’m open to friendship but not emotionally available to date (because of my complicated relationship situation). 

When a random guy around my age struck up a conversation with me at the coffee shop, I was friendly and chatted. I was not flirtatious, just nice and friendly as I would be to anyone talking to me, and had no idea if it was inappropriate of me to be talking with him. We didn’t talk about dating or anything inappropriate, just talked about the area, how there aren’t many people our age here (most people are much older than me and it can get lonely!), jobs, etc. I enjoyed talking with him but also felt so guilty about it. Was I leading him on? Being disloyal to my ex, who I have a complicated relationship with? I didn’t tell him about my complicated relationship status because it didn’t come up and it would have felt very awkward to mention it. He asked for my number to stay in touch and since we were having a friendly chat I gave it to him, as I have to other friends I’ve met (I recently connected with a couple of women and gave them my number too). 

I can’t help but feel like I did something wrong and I feel so confused and icky about all of this. If the coffee shop guy asks me out on a date I’ll just tell him that he seems like a genuinely cool person and I appreciate connecting as friends but I’m ending a complicated long-term relationship and not emotionally available to date right now. Was it wrong for me to talk with him? Should I have ignored him when he was friendly and approached me to say hi? Told him immediately that I have a boyfriend/partner (even tho I don’t)? Should I have refused to give him my number when he asked (I was conflicted but didn’t want to be rude to someone who was friendly)? All the work I do is virtual and I often feel so isolated and lonely these days, it’s nice having people be friendly to me. I would have also been thrilled if a woman my age approached me and gave me her number to stay in touch as friends.

1jasgmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1jasgmu/how_weve_been_tricked_into_thinking_we_need/,"How We've Been Tricked Into Thinking We Need Coffee to Function, Stay Productive, and Wake Up","Coffee is seriously overrated, and the entire culture around it is a complete social construct. We’ve been sold the idea that coffee is an essential part of daily life, that it’s a necessary ritual to 'wake up' and 'function,' but let’s be real—it’s just a bitter, burnt liquid that we’ve somehow convinced ourselves is the answer to feeling alive in the morning. In reality, it's not that amazing. Sure, it gives you a temporary energy boost, but it's really just a stimulant that messes with your body's natural processes. It spikes your energy, sure, but only for a short while, and then comes the inevitable crash, leaving you needing another cup to get through the day. It’s basically a cycle of dependency that people have been tricked into thinking is normal.

We act like coffee is some sort of magical elixir that fuels creativity and productivity, but the truth is that it’s just masking the root problem: we’re chronically sleep-deprived. The fact that so many people depend on coffee to get through their day is a reflection of the modern lifestyle, which has been optimized for overwork and exhaustion. It’s like a band-aid for a much larger problem—our poor sleep hygiene, overstretched schedules, and unrealistic expectations for how much we can handle without rest.

Here’s the kicker—there are so many better ways to get energized and feel awake that don’t involve shoving a cup of bitter liquid into your system first thing in the morning. For one, drinking water is way more effective for hydration, which is one of the first things we neglect when we wake up. After hours of sleep, your body is dehydrated, and rehydrating can help wake you up just as much as coffee. Stretching or doing light physical activity can get your blood flowing and help wake up your muscles and mind. You can also eat a balanced breakfast that includes healthy fats, protein, and fiber—something like avocado toast with eggs, or a smoothie with fruits, oats, and nuts—to fuel your body in a more sustainable way. These natural sources of energy don’t give you that jittery, anxious feeling that coffee can.

Then there’s the social aspect of it. Coffee culture has become so ingrained in society that it’s almost become a personality trait. It’s so normalized that if you don’t drink coffee, you’re often treated as an outsider. There’s this pressure to join in, like it’s a rite of passage or some kind of badge of honor to be a coffee drinker. But really, it's just a social crutch. People bond over their shared love of coffee, but it’s not even the coffee itself that brings people together—it’s the fact that we’ve all been conditioned to think it’s essential for our productivity, and in turn, it’s become a collective ritual that’s less about the coffee and more about fitting into a system that values output over well-being.

We’ve also been fed a narrative that coffee is some kind of life-changing productivity booster, but when you look at the science, it doesn’t really hold up. The reality is that it’s just stimulating your nervous system, and over time, your body builds a tolerance to caffeine, meaning you need more and more to get the same effect. And then, there’s the long-term impact of relying on coffee: anxiety, increased heart rate, digestive issues, and disrupted sleep patterns. It’s not exactly the miracle drink it’s made out to be.

Instead of depending on coffee as a crutch, we should be focusing on better lifestyle habits. Get enough sleep, practice mindfulness, eat a balanced diet, and drink enough water. Your energy levels will be more stable, and you won’t need to rely on a temporary fix that ultimately just adds to the cycle of burnout. Coffee is just another way of coping with an unsustainable lifestyle, and it’s time we start questioning why we’ve made it such a central part of our existence",0,1741915688.0,unpopularopinion,16,0.47,False

He was immediately willing to let me in after only conversing five minutes with the guy. Can you believe that? Cool right?

Anyways, here’s the cool part, he said that him and some buddies he plays poker with at another midtown indie coffee shop (Sapphires) bought a villa cabana in Crown Heights and is turning it into the “Next Big Thing” in New York City. I’m not sure what he meant by that, but he did use air quotes with both hands in the middle of a right turn while explaining it, so I’m definitely going to buy in to his future cash cow

1jas6xw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nietzsche/comments/1jas6xw/a_visit_from_the_angel_of_death/,A Visit from the Angel of Death,"The fever had harassed me for days.  
My breath was shallow, each inhalation catching like a thread pulled too tight.  
Pneumonia, they told me.  
Inflammation—fluid—a slow drowning within my own body.

On the worst night, my lungs were seizing like locked doors, each breath a struggle. 

Panic set in.

The Angel of Death appeared in my bedroom, hovering peacefully, glowing with impossibly bright light.  
She whispered to me—

“*Death is a natural part of life*.”

Every fiber of my being contracted against this evil utterance. From the depths of my soul, the ugliest, foulest superstitious vapors made themselves known—I closed my eyes and concentrated on pleading with all gods in all pantheons for one more breath—and another after that.

After a few minutes—or hours? years?—a more regular breath returned.

Shame washed over me; whenever I’ve heard others speak of how God saved them, it struck me as the most absurd arrogance—the belief that the entire fabric of Nature was torn apart & reassembled to win the favor of an ape on a planet teeming with billions of other apes—an ape that will certainly perish.

Yet I was no better. I had begged just the same.  
Had I not believed, in that moment, that *my* life was the most precious jewel in the universe?

When I opened my eyes, the Angel was still there.

“*You begged*,” she said.  
“*You pleaded. What does it mean to survive*?”

My throat burned. I didn’t appreciate this insolent interrogation. Undoubtedly, she knew the silliness of my instinct for survival—how it guided me as brightly as the summer Sun, even though that Sun would disintegrate in a few decades and scatter its black dust into space.

Nonetheless, I answered, terse and defiant:  
  
“*It means to endure*.”

The Angel tilted her head. “*For how long?*“

I could feel my blood rising. I wanted mercy and compassion, not whatever this is.  
  
“*As long as I can*,” I said.

“*And then*?”

Memories surfaced unbidden; my father lifting me onto his shoulders at the park like I weighed nothing, his pastel blue shirt smiling with promise in the sunlight. But in just a few short years, his hands began to tremble when he reached for his coffee in that hideously chunky Christmas mug he adored.  
  
I remembered the way he winced when he rose from his chair. The way the silver in his hair had spread like frost creeping over autumn fields.  
  
Nonetheless—his strength shall pass down to me like a torch in darkness.

“*My descendants will carry my blood*“, I told her.

The Angel wasn’t satisfied with this.  
  
“*Are your hands your father’s, or his father’s before him? Whose blood pulses in your veins?*“

More insolence. Of course I knew—the life in me was not my own. I was a branch of something older, deeper, endless. The cells in my body did not belong to me. They sought only to divide, to scatter, to play in the infinite storm of creation and dissolution.

But the thought repulsed me. To vanish—nameless, faceless, lost in the torrent—I could not accept it. My flesh might be diluted & forgotten, but my will could shape the world. I could channel myself into pure force.

“*I will build and discover. I will bend the future to my will. I will leave behind something undeniable, something that changes everything*.”

The Angel’s voice was quiet but insistent:

“*Like the first person who tamed fire?”* she asked*. “The first to bury their beloved? To craft symbols? To sing a song? To drape themselves in pelts? They shaped you more than any king, more than any prophet. Where are their names and voices?*“

“*They were not people of Culture,*” I said, my voice hardening. “*With the right words, I will be etched into the minds of billions, just as the Prophet’s voice still lingers in the desert air.*“

The Angel paused to think.

“*The poets, the sages, the philosophers—their words remain, but warped, stolen, wielded like blades against their own meaning. What holy text has not been a shield for tyrants and a grave for truth?* “

She let the words settle and continued:

“*For three hundred million years, trilobites ruled the seas. They outlasted mountains. And now they sleep in stone, their names unwritten, their reign forgotten.* *The first apes set foot on the earth a few moments ago. Your kind has seen only a grain of time. You build monuments and call them eternal—on a planet that forgets continents. You draw your names on water and expect restraint from the waves.*“

A pulse of anger flickered through me.  
  
“*But even if my words twist, even if my name and body is lost, something of me will remain.*  
*Some fragment, some*———”

I stopped to choke and cough.

The fever-sweat chilled on my skin.  
My lungs felt heavy again.

The Angel smiled—

\*\*\*History of hbA1c results from last year to the current:

1. Feb. 2024 — 5.8
2. June 2024 — 5.6
3. Aug. 2024 — 5.7
4. Oct. 2024 — 5.45
5. Dec. 2024 — 5.73

\*\*\*Profile:

Age: 49 (Nearing 50 soon)  
Weight: 140 lbs

Height: 5'9""

—Honestly, I was so frustrated last year that despite the drastic changes in my diet eliminating most of my sugar, carbs, and starches food and drinks intake (except for occasional treats) COUPLED with daily fasting (IF+OMAD), I only got a good result by Oct. 2024 (which I even doubt was accurate).

\*\*\*Here are my latest blood diagnostic results under Diabetic Studies:

1. Fasting Insulin: 5.5 ulU/L (Normal: 11.6-31.3) or 81 ug/dL (Normal: 65-175)
2. C-Peptide: 1.42 ng/mL (Normal: 0.78-5.19) or 473.33 pmol/L (Normal: 259.99-1729.98
3. HbA1c (IFCC): 39.3 mmol/mol
4. HbA1c (NGSP): 5.75
5. Estimate Average Glucose: 6.6 mmol/L
6. Fasting Glucose: 5.63 mmol/L (Normal 3.89-5.83) or 101.44 mg/dL (Normal: 70.09-150.04)

\*\*\*Here are my daily regimen to suppress blood sugar spikes:

\*Exercises

1. Manual Treadmill avg. 70mins/day 7/days per week.
2. Daily Push-ups avg. 400/day
3. Just initiated squats throughout the day at 20 squats per hour avg. for 16 hours.

\*Diets

1. Intermittent Fasting avg. 3X a week following the 16/8 regimen.
2. OMAD avg. 4X a week.

\*Food & Drinks

1. Ketogenic or High Fat low carb diet — Focused on meats, fish and eggs. Rarely to even no servings from foods high in carbs and starches.
2. Consuming green leafy vegetables almost every meal such as Romanian Cabbage and Arugula.
3. Eating nuts and seeds with the vegetables such as Walnuts, Blanched Almonds (Can't eat whole as it damages my weak teeth), Pumpkin Seeds, Chia Seeds, etc. I eat lots of them)
4. Fruits — Avocados (in-season, OFTEN), Apples (Almost Daily but only sliced), Oranges (Occasional), Blueberries, Passion Fruit, Star Apple (Rarely), Kiwis (Often), Guavas (If available), Passion Fruit (Rarely)
5. Teas — Stinging Nettle (Started this year—2 cups/day), Green Tea (Started This Year—2 cups/day)
6. Coffee — Mostly coffee with whole milk like Lattes or Cappucinos without any sugar. If sugar's included, substitutes used are Monk Fruit or Monk Fruit with Allulose. Taken OCCASIONALLY as in when we go out only.
7. Extra Virgin Olive Oil — Almost daily mixed with the veggies and the nuts.
8. Brown rice cooked in Coconut oil and then placed in the ref overnight. Only 6 oz/meal is consumed after heated. But beginning this year, I didn't get to eat that this much.

Now some in this community believes that IRON content may be linked with my HIGH hbA1C. Here are my Results under Anaemic Studies:

1. Transferrin: 198 mg/dL (Normal: 202-336) or 24.9 umol/L (Normal: 25.4-42.2)
2. Iron: 14.5 umol/L (Normal: 11.6-31.3) or 81 ug/dL (65-175)
3. TIBC: 53.9 umol/L (Normal: 44.7-71.6) or 301 ug/dL (250-400)

—May I know what would be the approximate range for a low IRON content in the body? If anyone thinks that I've low Iron content on my body, what do you recommend besides iron infusion? What food or drink should I take in? My next blood diagnostic test will likely be this coming mid-June.

—I'm beginning to think that, perhaps, maybe my OMAD diet could be causing this high blood sugar result because before my Oct. 2024 result of 5.45, there were many times I was in my IF (Intermittent Fasting eating 2 meals VS OMAD). Anyone care to shed light on this?

Don't worry, I won't give up but it would be helpful if anyone here could shed some light with my numbers and I will check if I can include it in my daily regimen and find out if it would lower my numbers.

I'm very lucky. And I've been riding motorcycles since I was 10 and raced Motorcross so I believe in good at handling two wheels. 

I also try to see something good out of chaos. Heck, I think I love chaos.

But in Vietnam, I cannot find anything positive to say about the driving. The people driving so slow it's dangerous. The people driving so fast it's dangerous. The one handed riding while on the phone. But the best one by far being the driving straight out into a T section (eg entering a bloody highway) and not even looking, expecting the traffic with right of way to slow first see you and secondly let you in. It's crazy.

Look, as I said I've been a lot of places. And I've seen a lot of wild driving and in some cases you sit back and go you know what? This works somehow. That is not the case in Vietnam. It's just dangerous and almost worse, it's inefficient which means the danger isn't even worth it. 

I'll give you an example, last night I was stuck in traffic. Took a look around. Was only actually 20 vehicles. The reason we were stuck in traffic? Purely because everyone was pushing in, honking, sitting on their phones, pulling over in stupid places. If everyone just did the right thing there would have literally been no traffic jam 😂.

Sorry for the rant. I do genuinely try to see the good inn every system but I'm convinced there is just nothing good about the roads here. I don't blame anyone either (well.maybe the govt) as nothing is enforced and from what I gather you can just buy a licence and a huge portion of the population don't even have one.

I was with my ex for 8 years, and we have a 6-year-old child. Five months ago, we separated in tears, and everything happened in less than a week. There was no argument or anything like that, just the routine that wore her down, and she eventually decided to end things.
For 4 months, there was no contact except for matters concerning our son, whom we have every other week. But then, after 4.5 months, things changed a little bit.
We had a shared album on Google Photos, and on February 12th, she took a screenshot of a heart being held by a brain telling it, “Can’t you see you’re suffering?” and the heart replies, “I want this person, not another.” On the evening of February 12th, she sent me a humorous Instagram reel about parenting.
The same week, she called the mother of my daughter, who is not one of her friends, and told her that when she left me, she was still in love with me and that she thought I was seeing someone.
The following Sunday, she suggested we have dinner at her place so we could be with our son.
The week after that, she called me several times for advice about her restaurant, things she could have easily found on the internet.
There have also been two or three more Instagram reels until today.
She also told me last week that she wanted to come to my work one day when I’m there, as she specified.
One day, when she dropped something off at my place, she stayed for 20 minutes talking to me about an outing and the decoration in her house.
Another time, while I was jogging, she waved at me and turned her car around so I could kiss our son.
Her business partner asked me to come to their restaurant for a technical issue, and at one point, my ex said that being single suited me, and her business partner said, “I’ll leave you, I’m going for a smoke.”
One evening, at 10 p.m., she sent me a message saying our son had head lice, even though she was going to drop him off the next morning, and there was nothing I could do at the moment.
The next day, when dropping off our son, she invited me up to her place and offered me a coffee. I accepted, but I spent the hour playing with our son.
I also see that she’s often online on Instagram, for example, once at 1 a.m., then at 4 a.m., and again at 6 a.m., even though I know she’s usually someone who sleeps a lot.
Another time, she ended our call with a kiss.
Last Wednesday, while I was picking up our son from school, she came to pay for the cafeteria, even though she usually pays online.
All of these things have happened in the last 3-4 weeks, and I really don’t know what to think.",1,1741914487.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I’m done with surface-level interactions and looking for a genuine connection with someone who values honesty, kindness, and a good sense of humor.  

I’m a huge fan of *Star Wars* and *Lord of the Rings*—I can quote them both, and I’m always up for a friendly debate about the best characters or story arcs. When I’m not immersed in epic sagas, I love spending time in nature, whether it’s hiking through scenic trails or taking a refreshing swim. There’s something about the outdoors that clears my mind and recharges my soul.  

I also have six tattoos, and most of them are proudly nerdy—think *Star Wars*, nature-inspired designs, and even a little anime. They’re like permanent reminders of the things I love, and I’d love to hear about any tattoos or meaningful art you might have too!  

I occasionally travel for work, which has given me some amazing opportunities to explore new places. Recently, I visited Canada, and it was an incredible experience. I’d love to swap travel stories or hear about your favorite destinations.  

As a laid-back introvert, I thrive in quieter, meaningful moments. I’m the kind of person who enjoys a cozy night in, watching a favorite movie or having a deep conversation over coffee. But don’t get me wrong—I also love adventures, especially when they involve nature or exploring new places.  

What I’m really looking for is someone who’s as interested in building a meaningful connection as I am. It’s totally okay if you’re not into the same things as I am—I’d love to learn about what makes *you* light up. Whether it’s sharing our favorite books, debating the best pizza toppings, or just being there for each other on tough days, I want to find someone who’s kind, genuine, and maybe just as awkward as I am.  

I understand that physical attraction is important for some people, and I’m totally okay with sharing a picture early on—it helps avoid wasting time and ensures we’re both on the same page.  

I’m open to connecting with someone from anywhere—distance isn’t a dealbreaker for me if the connection is right. If you’re someone who values deep conversations, shared adventures, and the possibility of turning this ""forever alone"" thing into a ""forever together,"" let’s chat. Bonus points if you’re into *Star Wars*, LOTR, anime, or have a favorite swimming spot—but if not, that’s okay too! I’d love to hear your story and see if we click",1,1741914110.0,r4r,1,0.99,False

The rules are that I need permission and I must check in before I leave, text when I'm there, text when I'm heading back home, and check in when I get home. I would be gone about 2 hours, the weather is good, and the time I mentioned it well after my mama gets off of work. 

I asked twice, the first time where she just sorta breezed past me with a ""no"" and the second where I caught her and said something along the lines of ""Hey, I really feel like this is weird, I really want to see my girlfriend since it's spring break and I barely get to. It's a 15 minute walk, I checked the weather, the only involvement I need from you is permission and following our pre established check in rules"".

Did you know that **excessive caffeine consumption** combined with **chronic stress** can wreak havoc on your hormonal health? While that morning coffee might give you a quick energy boost, it could also be silently contributing to hormonal imbalances and long-term health issues.

Here’s how caffeine and stress impact your hormones:

✔ **Increased Cortisol Levels:** Caffeine stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol, the stress hormone. Chronic overproduction can lead to **adrenal fatigue**, weight gain, and disrupted sleep.  
✔ **Disrupted Blood Sugar Balance:** High caffeine intake may cause blood sugar spikes and crashes, increasing **insulin resistance** over time.  
✔ **Hormonal Imbalances:** Caffeine can interfere with **estrogen metabolism**, potentially worsening PMS, irregular cycles, and menopausal symptoms.  
✔ **Sleep Disruption:** Consuming caffeine later in the day disrupts **melatonin** production, leading to poor sleep quality and further hormone dysregulation.

If you rely on caffeine to push through fatigue, it may be time to explore healthier alternatives. Simple changes like **stress management techniques**, **balanced nutrition**, and reducing caffeine intake can restore hormonal harmony.

Started as a 1st AC in short films and music videos, later commercials, and then MOW; did some documentaries and reality shows as well. In the meantime, I’ve been given some small opportunities as DOP, shooting short films and music videos with friends.

I have learned this industry is extremely unstable, and “who you know” is more important than “how good you are” sometimes - even though skill levels are still very important. (Please correct me if I’m wrong.)

That being said, I understand I am still early in my career, and there’s much to learn. I learn pretty quickly on the technical side of the job, but I’m trying to figure out how to meet more people and get on set more. (From my understanding, didn’t go to film school and jumping into 1st AC right away is kinda limiting my network.)

The current goal is to work as a 1st AC on long format shows more, and keep building my portfolio as a DOP in smaller scale productions.

Things I have tried:
- Go to networking event & workshop
- Volunteer as 1st AC to get to work with DOP that I want to build relationships with / help out director friends as DOP for their short film
- Ask more established people for a coffee chat for advice 
- Applied Local Union (haven’t heard back yet)

Things I haven’t tried but for a reason:
- Work in a rental house: I still get to work on set from time to time, don’t wanna asking days off to go to set as I wanna be responsible for every job I take.

Ok, so here is what is going on. I have a 2014 Chrysler Town & Country (30th anniversary edition). It has 95K miles on it. About 2 months ago I got the P0128 engine code. Unfortunately, I ignored it because I was tight on money and the van was driving just fine. Then, over the past week it started stalling randomly while I was driving. Usually after I had already been driving for 15-20 minutes it would randomly stall out while idling or going from a complete stop at a red light to just starting to accelerate through the light. It was on and off (and I knew I had to get it figured out at this point), but since it would start back up just fine and I had full days at work, I just planned on getting it checked out on the weekend. Well, yesterday (Wednesday) I drove to my first job of the day just fine, and stopped at the gas station for a coffee afterwards. Then I started to drive away (barely left the parking spot) and it stalled out again. Except this time the van would not start back up. It would crank and crank but never start. After a few tries it stopped even trying to crank. Just hear the click from the starter when pushing the start button and after a few seconds a second click. No crank or anything. So I just towed it to my parents house (I live in an apartment and can't work on vehicles there). Got the code reader and found that in addition to the original P0128, I also now have the P0443 for the evap can solenoid. I checked the battery and have 12.5 volts and also never had any dimming lights. I think coincidentally that my starter has failed too. I have purchased the coolant thermostat and housing, the evap can purge solenoid valve, and a starter. I am planning on getting to work on it tomorrow since I am off. But, I wanted to see if anybody has any thoughts about the 2 codes and it not starting up now being possibly related? Did I kill my starter trying to start the van multiple times? Lol I am not looking forward to the starter replacement because I think I have to remove one of the engine mounts at the very least to get to it. Anyways, sorry for the long post. Any help would be appreciated. Hope everyone is having a better week than me.",1,1741913830.0,AskMechanics,1,1.0,False
1jartpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimMarriage/comments/1jartpd/urgent_advice_needed_brother_is_marrying_a_revert/,"URGENT: Advice needed, Brother is marrying a revert.","\*Throwaway acc, cant give too much detail cuz I don't wanna be recognized.

  
So I (16m) recently found out my brother (30ish m) is wanting the get married, and to a revert.

  
I need to give some backstory so it makes sense. Basically my brother has been emotionally and sometimes physically abusive to our whole family for years. I would say since I was seven he would yell at me and call me things cuz I was overweight. He would yell and call me lazy and arrogant and whatever. But also to my mom he would yell at her and expect fresh cooked food every time he came home from work and she would do it (cause that's what all desi moms do ig) but if anything was wrong he would start yelling and screaming. Im talking like a glass being a little dirty, or food taking too long. And the type of yelling was also crazy. Like I always say that its something you cant really imagine until you hear it cause its just so loud and makes your body shiver. 

  
But anyway, after years of this, one day he got mad again cause he lost one of his things and thought my mom threw it away or something, and started yelling and smashing plates and stuff and my mom finally called the cops and he said ""ill never show my face to you again"" and left.

  
Well that was about a year or two ago and last month we got a knock on the door and lo and behold there he was. I let him in and my mom and dad were so happy and I just went to my room. So now whenever he comes over i just go sit in my room (which is funny cause I'm not allowed to sit in my room any other time but whatever)

Now apparently he's changed and become not abusive anymore but respectfully, I call bull\*\*\*\*. Obviously you can act nice after two years away from your family, but time away doesn't just fix your mental problems and he hates the idea of therapy (from what I know)

So I don't really talk to him or hear anything about him but yesterday I was told that he wants a to marry a girl and that she's a revert.  

The only thing I know about this woman is that she reverted and doesn't really have a relationship with her family. I don't know if the family thing is because of the reversion or something else. My mom also said she's in a ""crisis"" and I really don't know what she meant by that.

  
Apparently tomorrow, he's gonna come to our house and introduce her to our family. Now I probably will just stay in my room cause I don't wanna be involved in any part of his life. 

Now my problem is whether or not to do something because I've heard a lot about how muslim men like to marry revert women cause they may not know as much about their religion and are easier to take advantage of. I really dont want this to happen because if it doesnt end well, this sister might leave islam just because of him.

  
My question is, should I do anything or just leave it be. I was thinking if this actually moves forward than I should ask my mom to set up a meeting between me and her at like a coffee shop where I just tell her more about my brother because I don't know what she knows about him or his relationship with his family. I could give her my number and tell her if you have any problems just reach out to me cause I know you probably have no one else, and I'm the only one in my family who doesn't blatantly support my brother in everything. 

  
I'm conflicted because on one hand, maybe I shouldn't do anything, but on the other I feel like its my responsibility as the male in this family aside from my father who doesn't really make any good decisions.

  
there's just so many red flags, cause I don't know why he would want to marry a revert who isn't from our culture aside from the fact that he wants to take advantage of her. I also heard something from my sister about this whole process happening rather quickly; like in a few months which is also suspicious. I just really want what's best for this revert woman and I don't think my brother is the right person for her.

  
I'm sorry I keep rambling but also I just remember how badly he treated his own mother and wonder how much worse it could get if he gets ""his own property.""

Also I don't know if this is important but he was also briefly engaged to a kinda non-practicing liberal muslim from our culture in 2018 or 19 but that didn't work out. So it was also confusing to me why he went from wanting a non-practicing non-hijabi woman to wanting to marry a revert. But then again I don't know how practicing this revert woman is.

Any advice would be appreciated. 

  
TL;DR, My brother who has (or did have) an abusive nature wants to marry a revert muslim woman and I don't know if I should involve myself.",1,1741913777.0,MuslimMarriage,0,1.0,False
1jartn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypothyroidism/comments/1jartn4/overmedicated_whats_even_going_on/,"Overmedicated, what's even going on?","Hi, looking to follow up with my last post as my anxiety around this is frustrating me a bit. So it seems like my dose change from 125mcg to 100mcg of Synthroid didn't do much. Somehow my TSH went from 0.35 to 0.06, FT4 rose slightly too despite the dose drop. Any ideas on why this could be happening?

My dose has been lowered to 75mcg and potentially skipping a couple of days, is that advisable? Trying to figure out if I should skip a week or just a couple of days, doctor left it up to me based on my own comfort level and feeling.

The only thing I can think of that increased my absorption is that I did cut out coffee and oat milk when switching from 125mcg to 100mcg strictly because my anxiety has been pretty rough. I also moved to drinking the synthroid with a larger glass of water (mainly because I've been dehydrated waking up). That's really the only change I made when going from 125 -> 100.

Mostly still dealing with severe anxiety, panic attacks, sweaty palms, weight loss (down from my usual 150s to 142 now), higher than usual resting heart rate (70s - 80s instead of my usual 50s-60s), poor sleep (waking up very early in the morning, and generally feeling like I drank way too many coffees lol

I’m a 33-year-old laid-back introvert from Texas, and I’m here because I’m ready to find something real. I’m done with surface-level interactions and looking for a genuine connection with someone who values honesty, kindness, and a good sense of humor.  

I’m a huge fan of *Star Wars* and *Lord of the Rings*—I can quote them both, and I’m always up for a friendly debate about the best characters or story arcs. When I’m not immersed in epic sagas, I love spending time in nature, whether it’s hiking through scenic trails or taking a refreshing swim. There’s something about the outdoors that clears my mind and recharges my soul.  

I also have six tattoos, and most of them are proudly nerdy—think *Star Wars*, nature-inspired designs, and even a little anime. They’re like permanent reminders of the things I love, and I’d love to hear about any tattoos or meaningful art you might have too!  

I occasionally travel for work, which has given me some amazing opportunities to explore new places. Recently, I visited Canada, and it was an incredible experience. I’d love to swap travel stories or hear about your favorite destinations.  

As a laid-back introvert, I thrive in quieter, meaningful moments. I’m the kind of person who enjoys a cozy night in, watching a favorite movie or having a deep conversation over coffee. But don’t get me wrong—I also love adventures, especially when they involve nature or exploring new places.  

What I’m really looking for is someone who’s as interested in building a meaningful connection as I am. It’s totally okay if you’re not into the same things as I am—I’d love to learn about what makes *you* light up. Whether it’s sharing our favorite books, debating the best pizza toppings, or just being there for each other on tough days, I want to find someone who’s kind, genuine, and maybe just as awkward as I am.  

I understand that physical attraction is important for some people, and I’m totally okay with sharing a picture early on—it helps avoid wasting time and ensures we’re both on the same page.  

I’m open to connecting with someone from anywhere—distance isn’t a dealbreaker for me if the connection is right. If you’re someone who values deep conversations, shared adventures, and the possibility of turning this ""forever alone"" thing into a ""forever together,"" let’s chat. Bonus points if you’re into *Star Wars*, LOTR, anime, or have a favorite swimming spot—but if not, that’s okay too!

Started as a 1st AC in short films and music videos, later commercials, and then MOW; did some documentaries and reality shows as well. In the meantime, I’ve been given some small opportunities as DOP, shooting short films and music videos with friends.

I have learned this industry is extremely unstable, and “who you know” is more important than “how good you are” sometimes - even though skill levels are still very important. (Please correct me if I’m wrong.)

That being said, I understand I am still early in my career, and there’s much to learn. I learn pretty quickly on the technical side of the job, but I’m trying to figure out how to meet more people and get on set more. (From my understanding, didn’t go to film school and jumping into 1st AC right away is kinda limiting my network.)

The current goal is to work as a 1st AC on long format shows more, and keep building my portfolio as a DOP in smaller scale productions.

Things I have tried:
- Go to networking event & workshop
- Volunteer as 1st AC to get to work with DOP that I want to build relationships with / help out director friends as DOP for their short film
- Ask more established people for a coffee chat for advice 
- Applied Local Union (haven’t heard back yet)

Things I haven’t tried but for a reason:
- Work in a rental house: I still get to work on set from time to time, don’t wanna asking days off to go to set as I wanna be responsible for every job I take.
